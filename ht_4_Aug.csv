UK to ban sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040,"Britain on Wednesday it will outlaw the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans from 2040 in a bid to cut air pollution but environmental groups said the proposals did not go far enough.

Environment minister Michael Gove announced the move as part of the government’s keenly-awaited 3 billion pounds (USD 3.9 billion, 3.4 billion euro) air pollution plan, which will demand that councils propose measures by March next year to reduce nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels.

The ban on petrol and diesel cars as well as vans follows a similar proposal by the French government, and will also include hybrid vehicles that have an electric motor and a petrol or diesel engine.

“The Conservatives had a manifesto promise to ensure that by 2050 there would be no diesel or petrol vehicles on the road and today we’re confirming that should mean no new diesel or petrol vehicles by 2040,” Gove told BBC Radio 4.

Britain’s High Court demanded that the government produce plans to tackle illegal NO2 pollution, largely caused by diesel emissions, and a draft report was published in May, but the full report was delayed by last month’s snap general election.

The government will provide local councils with 255 million pounds to bring NO2 levels to legal levels, with possible solutions including the removal of speed humps, reprogramming traffic lights and changing road layouts.

Campaigners want cities to impose entry fees on diesel drivers, but councils will only be allowed to do so if no other measures are available, with ministers wary of “punishing” drivers of cars who bought their vehicles in good faith, according to media reports.

“Diesel drivers are not to blame and, to help them switch to cleaner vehicles, the government will consult on a targeted scrappage scheme, one of a number of measures to support motorists affected by local plans,” a government spokesman said.

Gove added that he did not believe “that it is necessary to bring in charging.”

Campaign group ClientEarth warned that health issues “caused by exposure to illegal air pollution are happening now, so we need urgent action.”

Fellow campaigners Greenpeace also warned that the plans did not do enough to combat the immediate issue of NO2 pollution in cities

“While this plan makes the right headline-grabbing noises, in reality it means that children across the UK will continue to be exposed to harmful air pollution for years to come, with potentially irreversible impacts,” said Areeba Hamid, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace UK.

“Providing a long term vision is not enough, (Michael) Gove still needs protect our health right now from toxic fumes polluting our streets.”

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that the move could cost jobs.

“Currently demand for alternatively fuelled vehicles is growing but still at a very low level as consumer have concern over affordability, range and charging points,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

“Outright bans risk undermining the current market for new cars and our sector which supports over 800,000 jobs across the UK, we could undermine the UK’s successful automotive sector if we don’t allow enough time for the industry to adjust.”

Air pollution contributes to the death of more than 40,000 people per year in Britain, according to official figures, with nitrogen dioxide a particular problem.

Norway, which is aiming to end the use of all cars running on fossil fuels by 2025, offers generous tax breaks for electric vehicles as well as free parking and the use of bus lanes."
India vs Sri Lanka: Virat Kohli & Co. train under watchful eyes in Colombo,"Not often does one get to see the Indian cricket team training from close quarters. Even for the journalists and the like, it’s usually from the gallery or the stands that one gets to watch the team slogging it out in the middle while gearing up for a game. On Wednesday, however, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) uploaded a video on its official website where Ajinkya Rahane guides viewers through a training session before the start of the second Test against Sri Lanka. (KL Rahul back for 2nd Test)

“Hello everyone. We’re here in Colombo and it’s our first practice session at the Sinhalese Sports Club. We’ve come here just yesterday after the first Test match in Galle,” Rahane starts as cricketers could be seen entering the ground from the tunnel. “We played a bit of football after warming-up, practised a bit of fielding and then our batting coach explained us how we were to bat at the nets.”

India won the first Test by a record 304-run margin to take a 1-0 lead in the three match series. The victory was the seventh for India in Sri Lanka, who had a 7-6 advantage over the tourists before the start of the series. “We’re looking forward to this Test match. The boys are looking in great shape. (We’re) really excited about it; have great memories of the last time we came here. We’re sticking to our usual routine before a Test match. You can also find Ravi bhai (coach Ravi Shastri) and Bharat Arun watching our players,” Rahane added.

Indian openers Shikahr Dhawan and Abhinav Mukund could also be seen facing bowlers like Ishant Sharma. Captain Virat Kohli, too, rolls over his hand for a couple of deliveries while the coaching staff could be seen standing in close quarters and guiding the players. The tour is Ravi Shastri’s first assignment as India’s head coach as well after taking over the role from Anil Kumble.

“We have pacers bowling at a net and spinners at another. In that way everyone gets a chance to bat and our coach has asked everyone to have a go at the nets today. (Usually) two days before a match, we practice for around one-and-a-half to two hours, including slip catching, normal fielding sessions etc. and then head to the dressing room,” Rahane further added.

Although India is likely to field an unchanged side for the second Test that starts tomorrow, Sri Lanka have received a major boost as captain Dinesh Chandimal is back in the side while they have recalled batsman Lahiru Thirimanne as a replacement for Asela Gunaratne, who suffered a fractured thumb during the first Test."

Percy Abeyasekara remains Sri Lanka’s top cricket cheerleader despite age and demanding job,"We have only seen Percy Abeyasekara in a casual Sri Lankan shirt, waving the national flag and leading the chorus in the stands. The other, more formal side of Percy was on display at the Sinhalese Sports Club Stadium on Tuesday afternoon, when he walked in dressed smartly in a white shirt and a tie.

When not cheering cricket teams, the most famous Sri Lankan face in the stands, is a corporate man, working as a PRO at ACL Cables.

When the game is on, he wears his Sri Lankan heart on his sleeve, cheering the team heartily, but his infectious charm makes him equally popular with the Indian boys.

On Tuesday, the moment Rohit Sharma saw Percy, he greeted him, coach Ravi Shastri walked up to him and exchanged pleasantries, at the presentation ceremony in Galle, the Sri Lankan was happily chatting with skipper Virat Kohli. The Indian players sure love the 81-year-old cheerleader.

So, what’s it about Percy that endears him to this young Indian team? “They like my actions, my knowledge of the game, my cheering style, my singing, my style of talking. Among the touring teams, India is my favourite. Love thy neighbour,” says Percy, who has been with ACL Cables for 54 years now.

“Rohit Sharma always asks me to dance. The last time in Galle, he walked up to me and started asking “please dance Percy uncle. Some other fellows also joined me in dancing, but he stopped them, saying, ‘I want to see Percy’. Rohit now calls me Uncle Percy. Earlier, he used to address me by my name, but when he got to know my age, he started calling me uncle. I told him you should call me grandfather… I told him my grandson was 24 years old.”

Percy also has high regard for Virat. “He is a lovely guy, some people call him proud. He is not proud, that depends on the crowd and the way you talk to them (players). I cheer both sides and wave the flag for them,” says Percy, who donned the role of “Sri Lanka’s No 1 fan” in 1982 during the England vs Sri Lanka Test at the P Sara Oval.

Percy turned 81 on July 30 and there were plans to cut a cake at the ground with both captains in attendance at Galle. However, the plan didn’t materialise as India wrapped up the Test on July 29.

“I wanted the match to end on July 30… the (Sri Lankan) cricket board wanted to cut a cake and invite the two skippers. Nevertheless, the Indian players wished me from the dressing room when I was cutting the cake at the Galle Cricket Club.”"
Can Barmer become ODF by end of 2017 with 70% work remaining?,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set October 2, 2019, as the deadline for the country to become open defecation free but Rajasthan’s cabinet minister Surendra Goyal, who’s in charge of Barmer, set a different deadline for the border district for the ODF tag. When he was in Barmer earlier last week, he said the district should become ODF by December 2017.

However, considering the progress of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBM), the national sanitation programme for construction of household latrines, in Barmer, the new deadline looks unachievable.

SBM data shows that only 28% households in the districts have toilets now.

According to a 2012 survey, there are 4.5 lakh households in the district; 3.61 lakh of them didn’t have toilets in 2012. In four years, 108,848 household constructed toilets but this is just 28% of the household which were without latrines until 2012.

In terms of villages, out of 1,970 villages in Barmer, only 523 have become free of open defecation. This is just 27% of the total villages.

There are 489 gram panchayats in the district. Out of them, only 173 are ODF, which is again only 29%.

So, in all respects, around 70% of the target remains to be met for the district to become ODF.

Considering the situation and to fulfill the targets Barmer district collector Shivprasad Madan Nakate has taken an initiative and announced a ‘Cleanliness Award’. Under this collector will invite village Sarpanch on coffee whose panchayats will get ODF tag.

Nakate said that he is expecting that this initiative will motivate the village sarpanches to personally look after the ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’s’ progress in their area. “We are also expecting that this initiative will help us to achieve the ODF target at the earliest, says collector.”

On the other villagers have alleged official apathy for legging behind in the ‘Swatch Bharat Abhiyan’. They alleged that authorities are not serious towards the campaign. Hemraj Choudhary, a local resident said that people in this region are belongs to backward section and financially they are not able to ensure such facilities.

According to Hemraj when government announced to support them with motivational amount rupees 12 thousand on construction of toiled people come forward and constructed toilets. Hemraj claimed that thousands are there who have constructed the toilets but now they are waiting for the motivational amount.

“Sometimes in the name of physical verification or other times in the name of budget crunch they were avoided for the payment. It is limiting their participation, he added.”

Countering such allegation authorities claimed that earlier they have faced budget crunch but now they have sufficient budget for the campaign and soon who have constructed the toilets will paid.

M.L.Nehra, chief executive officer at Zila Parishad in Barmer said that minister in-charge of the district Surendra Goyal has directed them to achieve ODF tag by December 31, 2017. He said that considering the topographical situation of the area though it seems difficult but also maintained that as people are now aware about the program and are supporting them, they are hopeful that they will achieve the tag by the deadline."
"Sri Lanka aim for the jugular, to target Virat Kohli-led India with spin trio","Shaken by the rampaging Indians, who destroyed Sri Lanka’s attempts at blunting their bowling prowess with a docile surface at Galle, the wicket is expectedly at the centre stage ahead of the second Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC).

After the rude awakening, the home team is aiming for the jugular and is looking to ambush the Indians with its spin strength.

Virat Kohli was in for a surprise when he walked into the ground on Wednesday, the eve of the Test. On Tuesday, he had gone back to the hotel planning a combination best equipped to negotiate the conditions favourable for pace bowlers, as the SSC wicket during the nets session had a fair covering of grass.

Kohli declared it was an ideal wicket which would produce a result. He was unaware that the nature of the track had changed in 24 hours, the grass shaved off as the hosts seemed to have lost faith in their pace attack after the mauling last week.

After the move to roll out a featherbed backfired at Galle, Sri Lanka want to pit their spin might against R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja by preparing a dry surface.

“It is a dry surface and should spin after the second day,” predicted Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal, who is making a comeback after missing the Galle game.

It was in contrast to how Kohli described the wicket. On getting a hint that the surface had changed, the India skipper replied, “We’ll see tomorrow”.

“We always name 12 in our meetings. Looking at things in the morning, if the wicket sort of changes or in today’s time some changes are made, we’ll take a call in the morning. According to what we’ve seen in the wicket, we already have a combination in mind. We’ll discuss those things further when we see the wicket tomorrow (Thursday) morning,” said Kohli.

Chandimal said his team was likely to go in with three spinners at the expense of a pacer. The home team may throw a double left-arm spin attack at Kohli & Co with old fox Rangana Herath teaming up with experienced first-class cricketer Malinda Pushpakumara. Off-spinner Dilruwan Perera will be the third option.

India aren’t likely to tinker with the winning combination, but the late development may force Kohli to re-look at his options."

"George R R Martin promises a Westeros book in 2018, gives update on The Winds of Winter","Author George R R Martin has treated fans with a surprise announcement that he would be releasing a Westeros book in 2018.

In his blog post on July 22, the author also gave fans an update about The Winds of Winter, the next book in his best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire saga.

“I am still working on it, I am still months away (how many? good question). I still have good days and bad days, and that’s all I care to say. Whether ‘Winds’ or the first volume of ‘Fire and Blood’ will be the first to hit the bookstores is hard to say at this juncture, but I do think you will have a Westeros book from me in 2018... and who knows, maybe two,” he wrote.

Martin also slammed reports claiming the book was finished and he was choosing not to release it.

“I’ve seen some truly weird reports about WOW on the internet of late, by ‘journalists’ who make their stories up out of whole cloth,” Martin wrote.

“I don’t know which story is more absurd, the one that says the book is finished and I’ve been sitting on it for some nefarious reason, or the one that says I have no pages. Both ‘reports’ are equally false and equally moronic,” he said.

AAP Government in Delhi completes two years: A report card,"For Delhi’s unauthorised colonies, change only on paper

East Azad Nagar was authorised four years but the area still has poor civic amenities.(Raj K Raj/HT Photo)

In street number 4 of East Azad Nagar, January was the month for hectic wedding preparations. The neighbourhood was transformed with festive music, lights and flavours. Nothing, however, could fix the perennial waterlogging in the lane.

“My daughter’s wedding was an occasion to celebrate but the water-logging caused us so much embarrassment. We stayed inside most of the time. It is what we do the rest of the year too as the lane is always water-logged,” said 65-year-old Asha (name changed), who lives here.

The 3-feet wide lane is home to a row of multiple-storey houses built on 25-yard plots. Four years back, East Azad Nagar earned the ‘legal’ tag as its layout plan was approved by the municipal corporation. However, that changed nothing on ground for the residents.

Regularisation of unauthorised colonies — one of the biggest political issues in the Capital — stems from the failure of successive governments to provide planned housing. Official estimates peg the number of unauthorised colonies in the city at 1,650, with about 50 lakh residents. East Azad Nagar was one of the 895 colonies which were regularised by then Sheila Dikshit government in 2012.

Ahead of the 2015 assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party also promised to provide registration rights with regard to property and sale deeds in resettlement colonies.

“We will provide water, sewer lines, electricity, schools and hospitals in a systematic and phased manner. Multi-pronged approach is the only way to empower unauthorised colonies, and has never been attempted by the BJP or the Congress. Within one year, these unauthorised colonies will be regularised and residents will be given ownership rights,” the AAP manifesto promised.

Soon after coming to power, the AAP government announced the decision to open registry of property in unauthorised colonies bypassing the process to be completed by the municipal corporations. The government said in 2015 that soon after it sends the boundary details to corporations, it will also allow registry of property.

However, the process is now stuck as the Union urban development ministry has asked the Delhi government to submit details of plot size and population in these colonies.

“We have received a letter from UD ministry with a list of queries. They want to know the population of every colony, size of plots, vacant plots, details of land owning agency and cost of regularisation,” said an official in the Delhi urban development department of Delhi government. Officials say it will take time to prepare the report even as lakhs of people continue to battle with the living conditions on a daily basis.

“Government should acknowledge that these colonies have come up because of the failure of those in power. The onus is on the government as they were supposed to build these houses. The government should simply try to make the living condition better in these colonies,” said Dunu Roy, director, Hazards Centre.

However, regularisation and approval of layout hasn’t meant better amenities for these colonies. East Azad Nagar, for example, has the tiniest of roads, no parking infrastructure, open overflowing drains and dangling power wires. Moreover, the structural safety of buildings in these colonies is a major cause of concern.

“Regularised or not, our problems are the same. The main road has been carpeted several times because of which the level of our lane has become lower, hence the water-logging,” said Rakesh, a resident of East Azad Nagar’s street number four.

Subhash Chandra Kohli, president of East Azad Nagar RWA, agrees that nothing has changed on ground. “Delhi government is still to include the colony in the official map of authorised Delhi colonies,” he says.

Senior officials who worked on approval of the layout plan of East Azad Nagar in 2013 say several rules, as per the Master Plan, were bypassed in the process. “The law mandates a clearly defined minimum width of streets and bylanes, space for public utilities and emergency measures. On paper, most of these were done with riders. For example, the width of the streets has been increased by marking them with dotted lines. A rider has been inserted in the statute that whenever the property owner applies for reconstruction of house, the building plan will be passed taking into account the marked line on the map,” an official said.

Officials admit that the only possible benefits of regularisation will be ownership of property and making the area eligible for basic government services. Vijay Kumar, a resident of street number 19, A-block, East Azad Nagar concurs, “The only way it helps us is that we can now sell and purchase property legally.”"
The Commuter Pig Keeper named the Oddest Book Title of 2017,"A public vote has determined Michaela Giles’ The Commuter Pig Keeper: A Comprehensive Guide to Keeping Pigs when Time is your Most Precious Commodity as the winner of the Diagram Prize for Oddest Book Title of the Year.

Organised by book industry publication The Bookseller, the prize is now in its 39th edition, having been conceived in 1978 as an antidote to boredom at the Frankfurt Book Fair, according to organisers. In the inaugural edition, it was “Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice” that earned the distinction.

This year, a public vote placed The Commuter Pig Keeper on top with 40% of the vote, followed by Renniks Australian Pre-Decimal & Decimal Coin Errors, Nipples on my Knee by Graham and Debra Robertson, An Ape’s View of Human Evolution by Peter Andrews and Love Your Lady Landscape: Trust Your Gut, Care for ‘Down There’ and Reclaim Your Fierce and Feminine SHE by Lisa Lister.

The Bookseller’s Horace Bent, administrator of the prize since 1982, called the top title a “classic” win, noting it “reflects Diagram voters’ long-held love-bordering on unhealthy obsession-of titles with farming or animal husbandry themes.”

"Navi Mumbai airport to be ready by 2019, but trans-harbour link to take you there needs a year more","Passengers at the Navi Mumbai International airport are likely to be inconvenienced for a while longer after the airport is ready because the main connector between Mumbai and the new airport is likely to be completed about a year later.

Speaking in the state legislative council, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that the state expected to complete most of the work on the Navi Mumbai airport by December 2019, while the Sewri-Nhava Sheva Mumbai Trans Harbour Link could take about a year more to finish.

The 220-km trans harbour link will take passengers from Mumbai’s island city to the international airport. Without the link, travelling to the airport will become cumbersome.

“We have received the final bids for the trans harbour link and hope to start work in the next work season. We will complete the major work of the Navi Mumbai airport by December 2019, give or take about two months. The trans harbour link will take about a year more,” Fadnavis said during the question hour in the upper house.

The next work season will start in October post monsoon. For the Navi Mumbai airport, pre-development work involving hill cutting and diversion of a water body are in progress, while work on the actual airport is scheduled to start next year.

The chief minister said that the government was also working on other methods to boost connectivity to the airport, such as through the proposed water transport project on the eastern coast and a Metro rail corridor between the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at Marol to the one at Navi Mumbai."
"CAT 2017 dates out, exam to be held on November 26 (Sunday)","Lucknow: India’s biggest MBA entrance test, the Common Admission Test 2017 (CAT 2017), will be held on November 26 (Sunday) this year in two sessions. The registration for CAT 2017 will open on August 9 and will close on September 20.

The Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow (IIM-L), which is conducting the test, will release the notification in newspapers across the country on July 30, 2017 (Sunday).

“The duration of the test will be 180 minutes,” said Prof Neeraj Dwivedi, convener, CAT 2017, highlighting some of the salient features of CAT.

CAT scores are accepted by the 20 IIMs and more than a 100 B-schools across the country. Around 4,000 seats are offered through IIMs.

Three sections

The test has three sections. Section I will have verbal ability and reading comprehension; section II will have data interpretation and logical reasoning and section III will deal with quantitative ability, he said.

Some questions in each section may not be of multiple choice type. Instead, direct answers will have to be typed online. The tutorials will clearly explain this.

“Also, we will allow use of basic onscreen calculator for computation. Candidates will be allotted exactly 60 minutes for answering questions in each section and they cannot switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section,” he said.

CAT 2017 will be conducted in test centres spread across approximately 140 test cities. Candidates will be given the option to select four test cities in order of preference.

Test cities and centres will be assigned to the candidates only after the last date for CAT 2017 registration and hence candidates do not have to rush to block slots and cities in the initial days of registration.

“We will try our best to assign candidates to their first preferred city. In case it is not possible, they will be assigned a city following their given order of preference. In the rare case that a candidate is not allotted any of the preferred cities, he/she will be allotted to an alternate city,” Prof Dwivedi added.

However, candidates will not be able to select the session because it will be assigned randomly. They will also have to pay the registration fee through online payment modes only with credit cards, debit cards and through net banking.

After submission of application, candidates will be permitted to download their admit card from October 18, 2017 onwards, till the test date.

A tutorial to understand the format of the test will be available on the CAT website from October 18, 2017. Candidates are advised to work on the tutorials, available on the website, well in advance.

Check the FAQs

The website contains a section on frequently asked questions (FAQ), which addresses candidates’ queries regarding CAT 2017. Candidates can also contact the CAT help desk over email or phone.

IIM-L is conducting the test after a gap of nearly seven years.

This year Professor Neeraj Dwivedi of IIM-L is the convener for CAT.

More than two lakh candidates are expected to appear in the examination. Experts sense that the CAT convener may bring in certain changes in rules to ensure more girl students and candidates from non-engineering backgrounds develop an interest in management studies.

Registrations for CAT shot up to a seven-year high in 2016, with 2,32,434 candidates applying for the entrance test to IIMs and other prominent B-schools. From CAT 2010 to CAT 2016, this was the highest number of applicants. Men comprised a majority of the candidates (67%), the percentage of female candidates marginally increased by 1% compared to 2015.

A week of upsets at Wimbledon may signal the end of an era,"Rafael Nadal’s dreams of a third Wimbledon title were shattered on Monday when he lost in the fourth round to 26th-ranked Gilles Muller. Then, on Wednesday, two more former champions and tournament favourites – Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic – went down to lower ranked players (Sam Querrey and Thomas Berdych, respectively). Murray and Djokovic were both thwarted by injuries, and Nadal, famous for his seemingly endless reserve of stamina, succumbed in the 28th game of the fifth set. Taken together, the three upsets – each one against a former champion now in his 30’s – may signal the coming of an end of an era in men’s tennis. To be sure, three upsets do not make a trend. And Roger Federer, the oldest of the Big 4, may yet manage to win his record eighth Wimbledon on Sunday. But a trove of data, compiled by sports statistician Jeff Sackman, also suggests that the previous decade of men’s tennis – characterized by a handful of top players’ domination of the field – may be very different from the years to come.

Upsets in Grand Slams In 2003, a 21-year-old Roger Federer won his first Wimbledon title. The intervening years have been marked by near total dominance in the men’s field, with four players – Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray – winning 48 of the 56 Grand Slam tournaments. If it has been one of the greatest eras of men’s tennis, it has also been one of its most predictable. Since Federer first became Wimbledon champion, upsets have become increasingly rare in the men’s field. If we define an upset as a match in which the winner’s rank was at least 10 lower than the loser’s, we find that the frequency of Grand Slam upsets dropped from about 26% in 2003 to about 21% in 2016. Every year since 1991, upsets on the men’s side were more common on the women’s side. But in 2008, men’s upsets finally became less common than women’s, and have remained so ever since.

While it is possible that the trend will continue into the future, it is at least as likely that the coming years will see a regression to the mean. That is particularly true because the men who have dominated tennis for the last several years are getting too old to keep winning all the time.

Tennis is old The Big 4 have been dominating men's tennis for more than 10 years now. The youngest of the four is Novak Djokovic, who turned 30 in May. The oldest, Roger Federer, will be 36 in August. They are not only the best players on the tour right now, but also among the oldest. And it’s not just the Big 4 – the top 50 players are on an average older than they've been in the past 30 years. Women, too, are getting older. And as the top players have aged, younger players have had to wait longer to make it into the top ranks.

However, the commission’s affidavit was silent on deploying Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) with EVMs in the forthcoming Gujarat assembly elections.

Countering the charges of tampering, the affidavit said technological features with administrative safeguards defined by EC make EVMs foolproof not only during elections but also during manufacturing, storage and transportation.

The document has been filed in response to a petition filed by Samajwadi Party leader Ata Ur Rehman who wants the court to make VVPATs mandatory.

A separate case demanding the use of paper trails in the Gujarat elections, is also pending .

The affidavit counters recent allegations against EVMs saying no political party has been able to establish that the machines can be tinkered with.

It also demonstrates the safety procedures the EC has in place to ensure no defective or malfunctioned machines are used in the electoral process. “Many of the systems used in other countries are computer based with internet connectivity. This makes them vulnerable to hacking,” it said adding Indian machines are stand-alone units."
8 crore certified literates between 2010-16: Javadekar,"New Delhi Nearly eight crore learners have cleared the basic literacy assessment tests held between 2010 and 2016 for being certified as literates, the Lok Sabha was informed on Monday.

HRD minister Prakash Javadekar said in the House that under the Saakshar Bharat programme, around 7.92 crore learners appeared under basic literacy assessment test held between August, 2010 and August, 2016.

Out of the total candidates, 5.88 crore learners successfully passed the assessment and were certified as “literate”.

Responding to supplementaries, minister of state for HRD Upendra Kushwaha said the states were free to run model schools.

SP member Dharmendra Yadav, however, alleged that model schools were shut down by the Centre. This led to a brief war of words between him and some BJP members."

"India vs Sri Lanka: Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane dominate Day 1 of 2nd Test","Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane smashed hundreds to help India seize the initiative on the opening day of the second Test against Sri Lanka at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground on Thursday. (IND vs SL Highlights)

Pujara (128*) and Rahane’s (103*) unfinished fourth wicket partnership has yielded 211 runs, India finishing the day on 344 for three in 90 overs as Sri Lanka’s spin gamble backfired. (IND vs SL SCORECARD)

Opener KL Rahul marked his return to international cricket from a long injury-lay off with his sixth successive half-century to set the foundation and the middle-order consolidated.

With Sri Lanka preferring a dry track, which is expected to take spin as the game progresses, India skipper Virat Kohli won a crucial toss to get to make first use of the wicket. India’s top-order seemed to fritter away the advantage before Pujara and Rahane combined forces to show how good the SSC track was for batting early in the game.

SL’s early advantage

Sri Lanka, 0-1 down in the three-match series after losing the Galle Test by 304 runs, have gambled with three spinners and a single pace bowler. Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath shared the new ball with paceman Nuwan Pradeep. Their attempts to put pressure worked for a brief while as they reduced India to 133 for three, with the three famed strokeplayers Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli back in the hut.

From that stage, Sri Lanka should have consolidated. However, Pujara and Rahane played positively to push the hosts on the backfoot, taking the initiative away for the home side.

All eyes were on Pujara, being his 50th Test, and he was playing at a venue where he had started his turnaround in 2015 with a fighting, unbeaten 145.

He didn’t disappoint, getting his 13th century and reaching 4000 Test runs. The SSC 2015 to SSC 2017 cycle has seen a glorious run for Pujara, in which he has notched seven hundreds.

Pujara steps up

After making a sedate start, Pujara gradually picked up momentum. Barring a few scratchy shots at the start, it was a faultless innings during which he was decisive in his footwork and judged the length superbly. His use of his feet against spinners was a treat to watch, forcing them to shorten the length or push the ball wide.

For his two left-arm spinners, Rangana Herath and Malinda Pushpakumara, Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal kept the third man region open while packing the on side. Pujara made a mockery of the tactics by punching holes through Sri Lanka’s defences on the leg side by time and again stepping out to on drive. While he would lean back and cut whenever the left-armers pitched short.

For Rahane getting his ninth hundred was important in the sense that he had, since scoring 188 against New Zealand at Indore in October 2016, the Mumbai batsman had gone nine Tests and 19 innings without a century. In between, he got to a few half-centuries, but was unable to convert it into three figures, a story similar to what happened in the opening Test at Galle where he got out after getting well-set.

Finally, before the talk about his conversion rate could grow any louder and affect his game, Rahane ended the wait. And Sri Lanka are left facing an uphill task if they are to come back into the game."
"France has a target: 10,000 Indian students by year 2020","A world player in arts, design, science and technology, France is Europe’s most innovative country. Ranking at number three among the global top-three in innovation, it is home to numerous Nobel Laureates and Fields Medal winners, artists and thinkers. This year some 4,000 students are going from India to study in France, but by 2019, the country hopes to attract 10,000 Indian students.

“France is first and foremost an experience to be lived,” says Dr. Bertrand de Hartingh, director at Institut français India. “You embrace the future and new technologies, and at the same time, also have a full taste of culture and history.”

Many students who feel their first study destination should be the English-speaking countries such as the US and UK should know that language is not a barrier. Students from India and the world over can study in France in English- or French-medium institutions. If they study in French, then like any other French citizen in French state universities, students benefit from free tuition. “They only have to pay for food, boarding and lodging, which are affordable,” says Dr de Hartingh, who is also also counsellor for cooperation and cultural affairs for the French government.

Once they complete postgraduate studies, Indian students in France have a stay-back option. They have an advantage in terms of job opportunities too. There are also around a thousand French companies that seek skilled professionals in India, including Capgemini, Safran, Saint-Gobain, Renault, and Orange. In fact, CapGemini has more employees in India than in France. “An employee who is well versed in French technology, know-how and culture is an asset for any company operating in India,” says Dr de Hartingh.

France Alumni also connects former students with each other and with French companies, continuing the partnership between India and France. “As young professionals who have experienced French education, students act as our cultural ambassadors in India. The Enterprises-Alumni job fair connects students and professionals who have studied or worked in France to potential employers. Last year over 200 jobs were showcased at the Job Fair in Delhi; this year Bengaluru showcased many more,” he adds.

Applying to France is easy. Campus France has 11 offices offering free counselling to students and help with admission procedures, visa formalities, etc. They are located in the Alliance Françaises in the following cities: Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi, Pune, Kochi, with two opening soon in Indore and Jaipur.

France’s programme “Bonjour India” – now in its third edition from November 2017 to February 2018 - promotes and fosters creativity, innovation and partnership between both countries."

Binge on these five super TV shows to escape the disaster that has been 2016,"Demonetisation. The US election outcome. Pollution. Leonard Cohen no more. Kashmir. Kanpur train derailing… And these are events that have occurred only over the last few weeks. The list gets longer and longer as you go back month-on-month to the disaster that has been 2016. So if you, like us, are feeling overwhelmed and need a different world to flee to – even if figuratively – here are five fantastic TV shows to binge-watch that promise an escape, alright. So get streaming and wake up (to a better reality, hopefully) when December ends.

Stranger Things

This Netflix-original that debuted in July this year, and which is possibly one of the best shows of 2016, is a sci-fi thriller with a liberal dose of mystery, drama and jumpy horror moments thrown in. But what makes Stranger Things so special – apart from the nail-biting plot and stellar cast – is the possibility it offers of an alternate universe where everything is just the same as yours, yet quite not so. The ‘Upside Down’ may not exactly be the kind of world you were hoping to escape to, but it is exciting no less.

Black Mirror

The third season of this highly acclaimed satirical sci-fi series released last month and the ratings have already been through the roof. Unlike the first two seasons that had three episodes each, this has six marvels, each with a different plot and cast. And each is a terrifying study into our world today – obsessed with technology, social media and keeping up appearances online – and the world we might be living in if we aren’t careful enough. As series creator Charlie Brooker said in a 2011 The Guardian interview when the show first premiered, “They’re all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes’ time if we’re clumsy”.

The 100

Another science fiction, this one is a post-Apocalyptic action drama that rolls both utopia and dystopia into one action-packed, heart-thumping show. Ninety-seven years after a nuclear war wipes out civilisation on earth, a spaceship housing the last lone survivors starts running critically low on life support. So it sends back 100 juvenile lawbreakers back to earth in the hope of repopulating the planet. You’ll be making a mistake if you plan to leave the rest to imagination.

The Returned

Adapted from the 2012 French series Les Revenants, this supernatural thriller that released last year will give you all the creeps, and then some feels. A sleepy little mountain town is suddenly thrown into complete chaos when several locals come back from the dead. No, literally! As if resurrecting from their other worlds wasn’t enough, they also haven’t aged and are unaware of their own deaths. The shock of their families is only understandable, but what is difficult to comprehend are the strange happenings that begin to occur in the town following their arrival. [PS: You might want to watch the French original, as the English one was called off air abruptly. Talk of strange happenings!]

The Night Of

This crime thriller that premiered in August this year had even Shah Rukh Khan hooked, reportedly. Don’t be discouraged by the fact that there is not even a hint of any other world in this – it’s simply set in present-day New York. Sometimes, a different world can exist in your own mind, where the sequence of events is vastly different from what is presumed by others to have occurred – especially when there’s alcohol and a cocktail of drugs involved. This is what happens when after a night of partying with a female stranger, a man wakes up to find her stabbed to death and is charged with her murder. Add prevailing racial tensions in the mix, and you’ve a total mind-bender.

How Hardik Pandya survived on Maggi before becoming Indian cricket team star,"Hardik Pandya, Indian cricket team star who has taken giant strides from being an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricketer to making his Test debut against Sri Lanka in Galle, has really come a long way. Battling several financial difficulties at home, he and his brother Krunal established themselves as talent to watch out for.

Hardik Pandya revealed his struggles and journey through the ranks to the national side on a talk show. The 23-year-old informed how he would eat two-minute noodle snack Maggi for morning and evening meals and borrow cricket kit to play.

“During U-19 days, my diet would be Maggi, both in the morning and evening. I was a big fan of Maggi and the situation was also like that. It was difficult to maintain a diet, financially it was a problem. Now I can eat whatever I want, but that time there were many problems in the family, especially financial issues,” Hardik Pandya said on ‘What the Duck’ show.

“During U-16 days, the taste buds were pretty active, it was tough to control, but now I have to. It has been a beautiful journey.

Borrowing cricket kit

“A lot of people are not aware of this. We had bought a car but there were no savings. Wherever Krunal and I would go to play matches, we would go in the car. We had to take cricket kit from Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) for one year. I was 17 and Krunal was, I guess, around 19. A lot of people questioned, ‘they are coming in a car but cannot afford a cricket kit?’,” he said.

Hardik clarified that many people were not aware of their situation. “We were pretty much sure we will never accept sympathy from anyone, no matter what.

“My father was the only earning person at home. He suffered a heart attack — not one but two and that too within one night. He almost got another attack six months later, but we were glad we reached the hospital in time. The financial problems started at that time ... we had no savings and perhaps we spent more than what we earned,” revealed Hardik.

“We used to get Rs 40,000 per year (read month) but they would cut Rs 4,000 TDS. Whatever we would earn would go in EMIs. We had a monthly EMI of Rs 10,000 for the car alone.

“We used to go to different villages to play. Krunal used to get more money — he would get Rs 500 for a match and I made Rs 400. But we would always travel in the car… nothing is bigger in life than self-respect (laughs). We would go to a petrol pump and buy two litres of petrol in bottles. We would stop a little ahead of the petrol pump. The second bottle would serve as back-up, so that we can at least get back home. We cannot empty both the bottles in one go, as we would never know how long it would last. This is my story till six months before I played IPL,” he shared.

What better to live moments which i often fantasized as a growing kid!

Hardik and Krunal both play for Mumbai Indians, but it is the younger brother who broke into the national side first.

Tendulkar’s advice

It is well-known that Sachin Tendulkar had told Hardik Pandya during an IPL season that he would play for India soon, but the former did not expect it would be within six months.

“I still remember the first time I met Sachin Tendulkar. It was a surprising encounter. It was the first match for Mumbai Indians (MI), I was already star-struck and we were leaving for Kolkata. I was having my food and someone tapped my shoulder from behind and said ‘hi’. I turned around and literally dropped my plate. I kept it aside; I was astounded. We were not expecting; no one had informed us that he would be coming over. It took about 20-25 minutes for me to gather myself,” he recalled.

READ | How Sachin Tendulkar foresaw Hardik Pandya’s meteoric rise as a cricketer

“Not many people would know this. When I had not even played for India, before that we had a do-or-die game in Hyderabad. He (Tendulkar) told me ‘I want to speak to you, meet me some time later’. I went to him after the match but he was busy with the team and he told me, ‘let us speak in Mumbai’.

“In Mumbai, after a warm-up session, I went to him. I was very curious what he would say. Tendulkar took me aside and told me ‘you are doing really well. I should not be telling you but the way you have been playing, the talent and potential you have, you will play for India in the next one or one-and-a-half years’. I called up Krunal and told him Sir has said so and so. For my family it did not matter whether I played for India or not, since it was Sachin Sir who had said this, it gave an assurance that I could do something good for myself,” Hardik shared.

Expressive Pandya

Hardik Pandya also recalled his innings against Royal Challengers Bangalore, batting alongside Harbhajan Singh. “I still remember it was my first innings against RCB. I had walked out to bat in a funny situation of sorts. Two overs were left and we were only two wickets down. I was not padded up. They had a bowler named David Wiese and he claimed three wickets in one over. I went in in a hurry and went to Bhajji pa, he said just one thing ‘jee le zindagi’ (live your life). I went on to hit two sixes,” he said.

“People think that I am a drama king. It is my personality, I cannot hide my expressions. Whatever I do, I do it openly, even when I am alone. It comes naturally to me,” Hardik added."
Cannes 2017: Fatih Akin’s In the Fade is all about a mother’s terrible sorrow,"Turkish moviemaker Fatih Akin, who lives in Germany, was back at the Cannes Film Festival with his latest outing, In the Fade. His last Croisette visit was as long ago as 2007, when he brought his The Edge of Heaven to clinch the best screenplay award. A story about loneliness, desperation and a sense of hope and hopelessness, The Edge Of Heaven was a great hit in Cannes.

But unfortunately, not In the Fade. Which seems to have divided opinion. An Indian journalist, revered and reviled for his right-wing extremism, saw Akin’s work as one propagating and promoting suicide bombing. This writer did not. Nor did a French lady, who works in one of the country’s government departments. She felt that it was “a beautiful story of a German mother’s angst at having lost her six-year-old son and her Turkish husband in a Neo-Nazi attack”.

In Germany and in some other places in Europe, radical Nazi tendencies are on the rise. There was a time when one saw posters proclaiming this political ideology even in Cannes - and cities like Paris.

So, Akin’s movie - if at all it has to be read as a political comment - must be viewed as one that underlines the futility of killing. Revolving around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground (NSU) - which has been targeting immigrants, especially Muslims, In the Fade draws us into a compelling, deeply disturbing drama about a mother (played with a touch of brilliance by Diane Krugger) -- who fails to get justice in Germany’s legal system when her little son and husband of Turkish origin are killed in a blast set off by a bomb outside his shop. The culprits are a young German couple. And after the courts falter and sets the couple free, the mother seeks revenge, planting a bomb under a caravan that the two use. She also kills herself.

In the Fade is the story of a German mother who seeks revenge for the killing of her son and husband of Turkish origin.

Akin, whose parents came to Hamburg in the 1960s, says he is very angry with that notorious group which perpetrated a series of murders in Germany between 2000 and 2007. He told the media here the other day: “The NSU scandals were huge in Germany in 2011. I was very angry when I heard what happened and that anger drove me to write this. As I started writing, other layers and characters were created to make the story believable. So it’s a character-driven movie more than a revenge or political thriller. It’s more about the evolution of grief, and what happens to a mother when you take her kids away from her. How does she continue to live?

“It disturbs me to be an enemy, just because I am who I am: the son of Turkish parents with brown hair and brown eyes. Or that you live in the West, and that you could be a target simply because of where you are from. We do not defend a political ideology but somehow we are targets. The only thing I can do is strike back with a film. My movie is a strike-back.”

The film revolves around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground.

In the Fade is narrated in three chapters. The first one is all about Katja (Krugger), who marries Nuri (Numan Acar), in prison. He is serving time for a drug-related offence. But he is soon out, and the couple live a happy life with their six-year-old son. The second chapter is all about the horrific nail-bomb attack in which the father and son are killed. The third segment takes us into revenge and retribution.

Akin’s work, competing for the Palm dÓr, is well shot, neatly executed and had the ability to keep this critic glued to his seat. Intelligently conceived, Akin’s In the Fade has the same power and punch that we saw in his earlier The Cut - a bold plot about the 1915 Armenian genocide in which 1.5 million people were butchered.

The question now is, as we go closer to the Palm dÓr, whether Akin’s vengeful tale will shake the Pedro Almodovar jury to give it a prize. There are of course other equally strong contenders like Redoubtable (a lovely take on Jean-Luc Godard), the American Civil War drama, The Beguiled, and Francois Ozon’s Amant Double about a torrid love affair between a psycho-analyst and his young patient.

What's it like to get trolled all day long? Take a look.,"What’s it like to get trolled all day long?

Being an outspoken woman on Twitter is hard. To find out how hard, we gathered a day’s worth of tweets sent to four prominent Indian women — Barkha Dutt, Rana Ayyub, Tavleen Singh, and Madhu Kishwar. We then filtered those tweets for profane or abusive words, categorized them, and sped them up by a thousand times. Now you, too, can experience the vitriol unleashed upon these women over the course of a day. Warning: The following contains coarse language and may not be suitable for children.

Barkha Dutt @BDUTT Barkha Rani Jamke Barasti Hai. Emmy Nominated Reporter. Author.Contributing Columnist @WashingtonPost Contributing Ed @TheWeekLive . Argumentative!Yaaron Ka Yaar : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Twitter users who are unable or unwilling to engage with the content of Dutt’s reporting often resort, as a child might, to name calling. Dutt frequently endures sexist and racist slurs and violent threats. Trolls also accuse her of being a shill for political causes, typically left-wing ones. As you can see, some of the terms we’ve highlighted are not always used abusively. Sometimes they are even used supportively. Other terms are not abusive in and of themselves — Pakistani, for example, is just a nationality — but are used so frequently in abusive ways that we’ve included them here.

Rana Ayyub @RanaAyyub Journalist, writer, film buff. Rooted in Indian politics and social justice. Free, fair, fearless. Author of Gujarat Files-anatomy of a cover up. : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

For Ayyub, a Muslim, hateful tweets are often coloured by Islamophobia. Trolls like to pretend Ayyub is an agent of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and to demand she “return” to Pakistan. Any criticism of India or its government, however reasonable or constructive, may be deemed traitorous. The trolls are about as vicious to Ayyub as they are to Dutt — during the week beginning Monday, April 10 and ending Sunday, April 16, we tagged 2,582 abusive tweets mentioning Ayyub and 3,020 mentioning Dutt.

Tavleen Singh @tavleen_singh columnist, author : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Trolls spare no one. Even Singh, who has been generally supportive of the Modi government and is perceived as being more “right-wing” than Dutt or Ayyub, has been accused of being a Pakistani propagandist and an anti-national. Yet even a cursory glance through her tweets reveals that the harassment directed at Singh pales in comparison to that received by her more “left-wing” counterparts. Singh received 195 tweets we tagged as being potentially abusive during the entire week that began Monday, April 10 and ended Sunday, April 16 — that’s fewer than Dutt or Ayyub received on any given day throughout the week. Moreover, the hateful tweets sent in reply to Singh are often directed at people other than Singh herself.

Madhu Kishwar @madhukishwar Factarian, Averse to all Isms. Maulana Azad National Professor, ICSSR. Founder human rights organisation MANUSHI : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Like Singh, Kishwar has been generally supportive of the Modi government; and, like Singh, the hateful tweets she receives are generally directed at people other than her. Rather, trolls try to dissuade her from even engaging people with whom they disagree. Unlike the other women here, Kishwar occasionally resorts to ad hominem attacks herself, calling her opponents names like libtard and Aaptard.

A note on our methodology These tweets were collected on the evening of April 17, 2017, using Twitter’s free REST API. We collected as many tweet mentions as possible for all four women, and then selected the day with the highest minimum tagged tweets among the four. That day was April 14, when Dutt was mentioned in 520 tagged tweets, Ayyub was mentioned in 433, Kiswhar was mentioned in 117, and Singh was mentioned in 56 tagged tweets. We chose the terms used to tag the tweets by reading through hundreds of tweets and noting which words seemed to be most often used in abusive contexts. This is not an exhaustive list — some abusive tweets were missed, while other non-abusive ones were included."
India vs Sri Lanka: Rohit Sharma to return home for medical check up,"Rohit Sharma, who is part of the India Test squad in Sri Lanka, will return to Mumbai for a routine medical check up.

“The BCCI medical team confirms that batsman Mr. Rohit Sharma will undergo a scheduled medical check up, as a follow up after his recent surgery,” said the BCCI in a statement.

“There is no health or fitness concern and Mr. Rohit Sharma will fly to Mumbai later today i.e. August 3, 2017, and will rejoin the team tomorrow i.e. August 4, 2017,” it added.

Sharma underwent a thigh surgery in London back in November. He had returned to competitive cricket only in the IPL held in April-May. The stylish right-hander has not made the playing eleven of the two Tests in Sri Lanka.

Environment hazard: Lucknow scientist had predicted breaking of iceberg in 2014,"Recently between July 10 and 12, one of the biggest icebergs on record broke away from Antarctica. The one-trillion tonne iceberg, measuring 5,800 square km, which is equal to four times the area of Delhi, calved away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica.

However, way back in 2014, a renowned scientist and environmentalist, Prof Bharat Raj Singh, director general (technical), School of Management Sciences, Lucknow had seen a wide and deep crack in the image captured by NASA satellite at western Pine Iceberg of Antarctica and had estimated its breaking and the impending dangers.

It was also stated in his book “Global Warming: Causes, Impacts and Remedies” published at INTECH publication, Rijeka, Croatia in April 2015 edition. But, scientists asserted that with the deposition of ice over this area, the crevice can be refilled and toned.

He stated this disaster can lead to submerging of the nearby islands along with the extinction of innumerous faunas in and around. He also asserts that this phenomenon would lead to dearth and extinguish all developmental activities and facilities of us.

Prof Singh adds it is a direct consequence of the negligent exploitation of the earth’s natural resources- minerals, oil, coal, to name a few.

An un-estimated augmentation in the population score and uneven or unparallel development around us every minute is also because of this. Sweeping off the woods, loads of vehicles, sprawling of industries are adding tremendously to the wear and tear of the nature around us making direct increase in the global temperature.

The iceberg is likely to be named A68, was already floating before it broke away so there is no immediate impact on sea levels, but the calving has left the Larsen C ice shelf reduced in area by more than 12%.

The Larsen A and B ice shelves, which were situated further north on the Antarctic Peninsula, collapsed in 1995 and 2002 respectively.

Scientists estimate that if this mammoth sized iceberg’s ice thaws, the sea level could have an alarming rise of about 10 inches. Moreover, this would be a grave havoc for the routing ships and submerging of the islands in its vicinity.

What is more to account is its area which is one and a half times bigger than Goa, four times the area of New Delhi and seven times that of New York. The position will now become bad to worst not only due to rise in sea level but will have ill effect of drowning of coastal area but hat have greater impact on vaporization which may lead to storm and excessive rain fall in coming 2-3 months."
"India vs Sri Lanka: KL Rahul back in XI, Shikhar Dhawan or Abhinav Mukund out","KL Rahul will open the innings for Indian cricket team in the second Test against Sri Lanka starting at the Sinhalese Sports Club from Thursday. The Bangalore batsman will be making a comeback to international cricket after a gap of four months (he last played in March this year).

“KL Rahul has been our established opener. I feel one of the openers will have to make way for Rahul,” said skipper Virat Kohli on Wednesday. “What he has done for us in the last two years has been solid. And he deserves to come back and start afresh in Test cricket.”

Kohli faces a selection dilemma over the opening combination after both Shikhar Dhawan and Abhinav Mukund put up a good show in India’s big win against Sri Lanka national cricket team in the opening Test at the Galle International Stadium last week. Dhawan scored a blazing 190 and should get the nod to partner Rahul. Mukund, on the other hand, failed in the first innings but made amends with a polished 81 in the second, and smart fielding at the vital short-leg position.

However, Mukund is likely to miss out.

“Rahul played the practice game (ahead of the series) and looked very solid,” said Kohli. “It is very important to make him feel that this is his spot and it will not be changed because of unfortunate incidents that happened outside of the playing field or the injuries you can’t control. He really stuck it out in that (difficult) phase which was hard for him.”

The Indian skipper said Rahul had proved his value and the team is backing him. The Bangalore batsman has had a tough recent run where he underwent a shoulder surgery after the Australia series and missed the Indian Premier League (IPL), the ICC Champions Trophy and the limited overs series in the West Indies.

He started with a half-century in the warm-up game in Sri Lanka but fell ill and didn’t travel with the team for the first Test at Galle. However, he looked good in the practice session on Tuesday, and had two long stints in the nets, which, ultimately, got him the nod.

“It is very important to make Rahul feel secure,” said Kohli. “He has given us those good performances when the team required it. He needs to be backed and the management, and as captain, we all back him.

“It will be hard on the player who is left out, and the choice will be made on who played the impact innings in the first game. It is a very thin line,” added Kohli. “I feel in a situation like this, you need to sit down and think which player had the impact on the game and who was able to make a difference on the game straightaway.

“It all depends on who had a better game, it is a very thin line, very small margins, unfortunately that is how this game goes,” explained the Indian skipper. “As I said earlier, the guy who sits out will understand that it is in the best interest of the game. In a scenario like this we will always think of the guy who had more impact in setting up the game or winning the game.”"
"The Big Sick movie review: Kumail Nanjiani, Anupam Kher star in the must-see rom-com of 2017","That two people could overcome centuries-old cultural obstacles, the perils of modern dating and a critical illness and end up together is a great story. That those two people also managed to adapt their own great story into a great movie is a miracle.

It’s the wonder of The Big Sick , the must-see romantic comedy of the year. Sweet-natured, funny and genuine, you’re not likely to have a more pleasant time at the cinema this summer.

At the centre is Kumail Nanjiani, the deft comedian who audiences might know from HBO’s Silicon Valley. He actually uses his full, real name in the film, which he co-wrote with his wife, Emily Gordon and based on their wild courtship. Emily has ceded her part to an actor, Zoe Kazan, who continues her very persuasive campaign to be the rom-com dream girl for those who fancy themselves better than rom-coms.

Kumail is a struggling stand-up comedian who pays the rent for his awful Chicago apartment by driving for Uber. When he’s not on the stage, or in the car, he’s at home with his family in the suburbs. They’re Pakistani and Muslim and have all had arranged marriages and expect Kumail to do the same. He’s managed to live a bit of a double life for a while - dating who he wants while also holding up the pretense of being a good Pakistani son. But everything changes when he meets Emily, the white grad student who he falls for and then loses when she realizes that he’s been hiding her from his family.

To be fair, they would literally disown him if he chose Emily over the scores of Pakistani ladies that “just drop by” their family dinners like clockwork, headshot and bio in hand. So Emily and Kumail break up. They have to. It’s a standard rom-com beat and obstacle. But then something happens: Kumail gets the call that Emily has been hospitalized, and the movie pivots into something entirely different and infinitely richer than most in the genre.

Suddenly he’s the one making the call to put her in a medically induced coma while also informing her parents, Terry and Beth (Ray Romano and Holly Hunter) of their daughter’s health turn. Beth is none too happy to have her daughter’s ex-boyfriend lurking around during their family crisis, either. Hunter plays Beth, at first, with that scary and all too recognizable indifference of a mother who doesn’t care to humour the man who hurt her daughter. But, like everything, that evolves.

One of the really wonderful and telling things about The Big Sick is how fleshed out the world is around Kumail and Emily - from Kumail’s comedy friends (Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant and Kurt Braunohler), to his family (Anupam Kher, Zenobia Shroff, Adeel Akhtar and Shenaz Treasury) and Emily’s parents, no supporting character is made into a caricature. Even the potential wives are given distinct and memorable personalities. Their presence is mined for comedy, but the women aren’t punchlines. It’s a delicate balance that The Big Sick gets just right.

If there is anything to pick on, it’s that we never get to know Emily as well as Kumail. It’s not her fault, she’s in a coma for most of the film, and we get a fair amount of colour at the beginning, but her arc leaves a bit to be desired.

Michael Showalter’s direction isn’t flashy or stylish, either. His camera is there in service of the story and the characters and it doesn’t get in the way.

Some stories are too good to be true, and some true stories are too good for the movies. Luckily for us, The Big Sick is neither.

"Chinese automaker SAIC announces India entry, will start making cars in 2019","SAIC Motor Corporation Ltd on Wednesday announced plans to enter India and start manufacturing cars by 2019, becoming the first Chinese automaker to venture in what will be the world’s third biggest auto market by 2020.

SAIC, formerly Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, will start making cars at its fully-owned manufacturing facility by 2019. SAIC is still negotiating to take over the General Motors’ Halol factory which closed operations on April 28 this year.

In India, SAIC has already registered its local subsidiary, MG Motors India. The company has roped in former GM India executives to lead its India operations -- Rajeev Chhaba will be president and managing director while P Balendran will be the executive director.

The largest automobile company in China stands 46th in the Fortune Global 500 list, with annual revenue of over $100 billion. The state-owned automaker has joint ventures in China with Detroit-headquartered GM and Germany’s Volkswagen, with brands such as MG, Roewe and Maxus under its belt.

Outside China, SAIC is present in several global markets including UK, USA, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Middle East, South East Asia, Thailand and Indonesia. It even has an ‘Overseas Innovation Center’ in Silicon Valley, California.

What models will SAIC bring to India under the MG badge remains a mystery. Founded in 1924, the Morris Garage has seen several change of hands before China’s Nanjing Automobile Group acquired it in 2005. It came under the SAIC umbrella after SAIC merged with Nanjing in 2008.

“The introduction of the iconic British Sports Car Brand ‘MG’ in India is an important part of SAIC Motor’s global strategy. Our aim is to provide best-in-class vehicles, integrating sophisticated British design and quality, breakthrough product features and a pleasing ownership experience,” the company said in a statement.

“As a new-age auto company focused on innovation and technology, the company offers various solutions and technological capabilities required in the development of ‘new energy vehicles’, to cater to the changing needs of global customers and the overall ecosystem,” the statement added."
"No more jet, set, go. Travelling is set to get expensive in 2018","If you’re planning a big trip in 2018 you might want to start saving up now, as the findings of a new report predict that travel prices will rise sharply across air, hotel and ground transportation next year.

The reason? A stronger global economy, higher oil prices and rising demand from emerging markets, say analysts in the 2018 Global Travel Forecast, released jointly this week by global travel management company Carlson Wagonlit Travel, and The Global Business Travel Association Foundation.

“The higher pricing is a reflection of the stronger economy and growing demand,” said Carlson Wagonlit president and CEO Kurt Ekert in a statement. “The global numbers from this forecast should be considered strong leading indicators of what 2018 will mean for global businesses, as we anticipate higher spending.”

The sector that will see the biggest global increase is hotels, with average prices forecast to rise nearly 4%. In Western Europe that figure is expected to spike 6 percent, led notably by Norway, where hotel rates will increase 14%. When it comes to flights, travellers will likewise shell out more next year, with rising crude oil prices expected to drive up the cost of global airfares by 3.5%.

And what travellers bound for Eastern Europe save on hotel prices, they’ll likely spend on increased airfare, with prices forecast to rise 7%. Likewise, travel to Western Europe will also be about 6 percent more expensive. Airfares for North America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa will see modest rises of about 2 to 3%, while prices for travel to Latin America and the Caribbean will stay stagnant.

And while global prices for ground transportation are expected to rise slightly to one percent, that figure shoots up to nearly five percent for Canada.

2017 World Cup a new dawn for women’s cricket in India and the world: Anjum Chopra,"On the eve of the final of the Women’s World Cup 2017, we were at a dinner for commentators and production heads celebrating the culmination of yet another landmark event for us. Just then we were informed that Doordarshan, India’s national broadcaster, would be showing the final of the Women’s World Cup along with the host broadcaster Star Sports. Cheers and high-fives were exchanged.

Everyone thought that since India was playing the final there was interest in showing the match. On a Sunday, it would have entailed changing their programming. But then came the logic that it was a match of national interest.

Undoubtedly this was the most-watched final in the history of women’s cricket. It wasn’t a final where people just watched, they analysed the match. They participated in the run-up to the big final against England, the emotions that came along with it and the heartbreak if you were an Indian supporter. I gauged the impact as I walked into my office and people came up with their own analyses of the match and the tournament. It was impressive to say the least. The game had made an impact. The fact that Indian women were playing the finals in a World Cup in England with a capacity crowd at Lord’s got the pulse of the nation.

For sheer numbers and the passion for the game that exists in the subcontinent, India always has and will continue to play a big part in ICC’s efforts to promote the women’s game.

I have always felt that it’s the players who make an impact. In a chicken and egg story, who comes first? I’d say it is the players. Not that the administration can sit back and not participate and do its bit. We are a result-oriented country where mediocrity cannot be celebrated for long, not long enough to hold people’s attention, results need to be delivered and consistently. It is imperative that we (the Indian team) win a final and become world champions. Being crowned world champions is a big tag and a milestone achievement. Then you don’t need to remind people about yourself and the team’s achievements.

We, Indian women cricketers, were in the final of a World Cup earlier too. It was in 2005 in South Africa. It was the last time we played under the banner of the International Women’s Cricket Council (IWCC). The International Cricket Council (ICC) took over the women’s game after that. Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami are the only remaining members from that team. Harmanpreet Kaur debuted in 2009 and she was soon followed by Ekta Bisht. The 2017 side had better experience than that in 2005 as it was the first final for Indian women back then. The experience of the current team gave them an edge and helped them bounce back from setbacks. Their batting performance started going downhill after the victory in the first match against England. They lost to South Africa and Australia, after which the team faced a dire situation: Win against New Zealand or crash out of the tournament. The team survived and in the semis, defending champions Australia ran into Harmanpreet Kaur. The onslaught on the bowlers that happened after she got to her 100 was a spectacle. The confidence she exuded and carried into the dressing room after her knock provided the impetus to the bowlers to back that match-winning effort. A knock of 171 not out in 115 balls.

For sheer numbers and the passion for the game that exists in the subcontinent, India always has and will continue to play a big part in ICC’s efforts to promote the women’s game. I was involved as a commentator in the build-up to the World Cup since February 2017. Well supported by social media, the ICC managed to pique the interest of the audience successfully, making it the most watched and followed World Cup for women till date.

The credit must go to the ICC for globalising the game. With this massive audience and the popularity of the 2017 Women’s World Cup, it is a new dawn for women’s cricket in India and the world.

Okja movie review: The first great film of 2017 has arrived. Protect it fiercely. 5 stars,"Okja

Director - Bong Joon-ho

Cast - Ahn Seo-hyun, Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Steven Yeun, Lily Collins

Rating - 5/5

If getting booed at the Cannes Film Festival is considered a badge of honour, it is a badge Okja must wear with pride.

It joins a list of films – a list that will probably have you performing an almost comical double-take in a moment – that for various bizarre reasons, found themselves at the receiving end of the famously snooty French crowd’s ire.

In ’76, it was Martin Scorsese’s bleak and brutal Taxi Driver. In ’94, it was Quentin Tarantino’s cultural watershed Pulp Fiction. And in 2011, it was Terrence Malick’s masterpiece, The Tree of Life. Each of these classics was heckled at their Cannes screenings. And each of these films, despite the heckling, won the festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or.

In 2017, the honour (the booing, but sadly not the Palme) went to Okja, the new film by cult South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho – although for reasons we’ve never heard before. Despite ending with one of the most unexpectedly forceful tonal shifts in recent memory – the film goes from being a magical, Miyazaki-esque fable, to a horrifying skewering of mankind in the space of 30 minutes – the most controversial moment in Okja’s Cannes premiere came before it even began. When the Netflix logo ‘duh-dum-ed’ its way onto the screen, the old-school crowd let its disapproval (and fear of the future) be known. Critic David Ehrlich, tweeting from inside the Palais, described it as a ‘prison riot environment.’

It’s natural, as spoiled, needy human beings, for us to want better, never satisfied with what we have. Similarly, it is natural, while the glorious Okja unfolds before your eyes, to wonder just how different it would be on a big screen. Would it be better? Would it be worse? Would the lush Korean landscapes be more breathtaking? Or would the cracks in the CGI be more visible?

Tilda Swinton as Lucy Mirando in OKJA

We will never know. And that is OK. Because despite making the cardinal sin of not being made available to your local multiplex, Okja does what most event movies and summer blockbusters, proudly shot in IMAX, can’t. It cares about its characters, its tone, its craft, and it has enough confidence in you, the audience, to stick with it, even when it becomes too challenging, and even when the mirror it holds up to your face reveals all the blemishes you’ve been trying to hide.

Its story begins several years ago, in a colourful prologue. Tilda Swinton plays the CEO of a powerful multi-national corporation, who, with great fanfare, announces the discovery of a new pig-like creature that her company will breed, and then ship off to 26 far-flung corners of the world, to live with local farmers.

10 years later, in a remote mountain-top farm in South Korea, one of the creatures, now grown up, bounds across the gorgeous countryside, a young girl by its side. She is Mija, the granddaughter of one of the farmers chosen to care for the animal, and she has named it, also a girl, Okja. This is their world. It is all they have. And it is all they need.

Wordlessly, with the aid of some truly wonderful creature design and visual effects, Bong conveys the essence of his film these opening scenes. It is a story about nature and nurture. It is a story about being an innocent child trapped in a harsh world run by adults who’ve been ruined by it, by greed, and by success.

But above all else, it is a story about the evil of mankind, and the depths to which we are capable of sinking. Much like his previous movie, the monumentally underrated Snowpiercer (another film in which he gave Tilda Swinton a memorably despicable character to play), Okja, too is a science fiction story, just as nihilistic, just as furious at our hypocrisy, and just as unforgettable.

OKJA

Like Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel Maus, it addresses real-life horrors by replacing images seared into our minds with fantasy, with animals, and with humour.

And fantasy is what Mija needs, when one day, a sweaty, moustachioed, obnoxious American hikes up to her farm. He is Dr Johnny Wilcox, employee of the Tilda Swinton’s MNC, played by a screechingly over-the-top Jake Gyllenhaal, who comes bearing terrible news. In one fell swoop, he destroys Mija’s world. He has come to take Okja away from her.

Jake Gyllenhaal as Dr. Johnny Wilcox in Okja.

Mija’s grandfather, a poor farmer, has already made the deal. It’ll keep food on their bellies. Perhaps it’ll pay for her education too. He’s only coming through the promise he made to her dead parents. He’s taking care of their daughter.

But Mija isn’t the sort of girl to take injustice lying down. She isn’t the sort of girl to resign herself to her fate – or to let Okja fall prey to hers. She packs a bag, breaks open her piggy bank, and journeys across the world to New York, where she plans to break into the headquarters of the Mirando Corporation, and rescue Okja.

Along the way, she is joined by members of the ALF (Animal Liberation Front), played by Paul Dano, Lilly Collins and Steven Yeun, who, despite having their own twisted agenda, are the closest the film comes to having decent people (besides Mija, of course).

OKJA

In a fair world, Okja would have the power to make even the most belligerent meat eaters consider vegetarianism. It would make us question the truths we ignorantly accept. It would make us seek answers, challenge the consumerist culture we so blindly embrace. It would inspire change. But – and Okja would be the first to remind us of this – the world is hardly a fair place.

As an animal lover, I wouldn’t wish the very particular emotional jolt this movie delivers on my worst enemy. Be warned: There is very little hope here. There is only bleakness. But there’s no turning away from Okja. We must spread word about it. We must champion it. Because it is the first great film of 2017.

Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”,"Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”

The government’s rankings of the cleanest cities in the country, released last week as part of the Swachh Bharat campaign, had some surprising outcomes. “Is Varanasi really cleaner than Bhubaneswar?” my editor asked in an article earlier this week. Others have asked some version of the same question: How were these rankings produced? And is the methodology sound? The rankings consider three broad categories of data: documentation provided by civic authorities, feedback from citizens, and independent ground assessments. Intuitively, one might think that the ground assessments — which involve unbiased people observing how clean the city actually is — would be the most important source of data. But the way the Ministry of Urban Development calculated the rankings, ground assessments are the least important. Instead, 45% of the ranking comes from documentation provided by the cities, 30% comes from citizen feedback, and the remaining 25% is derived from the ground assessments. What if these categories were weighted differently? We’ve built a tool that lets you find out. Adjust the weights of the three categories below, and see how the rankings change.

Use the white handles to adjust the weights. Documentation Ground assessment Citizen feedback

Or, use these buttons.

Reset Documentation only Ground assessment only Citizen feedback only All three are equal

View chart City Your rank Gov't rank Change in rank Each dot represents a city or civic authority. Hover over a dot for details. Scores get higher with your weights or lower with your weights.

So what if we scrap the documentation and citizen feedback, instead relying entirely on the ground assessment? Bhopal rises to the top of the list, while Indore falls to 11th. Varanasi actually improves, rising from 32nd to 28th, while Bhubaneswar improves from 94th to 70th, still far behind. If we only consider citizen feedback, Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh, rises from 136th to the top of the charts. Apparently, Neemuch’s citizens think their city is very clean, even if the government and independent assessors disagree. And if only documentation matters, Chandigarh becomes the country’s cleanest city, rising from its former rank of 11th. Why did the government choose to weight documentation so heavily? “In initial years, you have to push municipalities to do work,” said Quality Council of India’s Anay Agarwal, who directed the survey project. “Even if results are not visible on the ground, they have to be awarded — in terms of higher ranking — for starting the work.“ In other words, by weighting the rankings as it does, the government wants to encourage cities to demonstrate an institutional commitment to staying clean. By this thinking, cities that provide documentation of their clean-up efforts demonstrate a commitment to the process, even if the results have yet to show up on the ground.

China’s old age population crossed 230 million in 2016,"China’s rapidly increasing old age population has reached 230.8 million or 10.8 per cent of the total population by the end of last year, according to official figures released on Thursday.

China had more than 230.8 million people aged 60 or above, 16.7 per cent of the total population, at the end of 2016, the ministry of civil affairs said.

Of the 230.8 million, 150.03 million were 65 or above, or 10.8 per cent of the total population, according to a report released by the ministry.

By international standards, a country or region is considered to be an “ageing society” when the number of people aged 60 or above reaches 10 per cent or more.

China’s old age population above 60 years will reach 255 million by 2020 putting heavy stress on geriatric care services, China’s planning body said earlier.

Bracing for the demographic crisis China last year relaxed the four decades old one child policy by permitting two children for couples.

The ministry said China has 140,000 nursing homes holding a total of more than 7.3 million beds at the end of 2016, with a year-on-year increase of 20.7 per cent and 8.6 per cent respectively. However, there are only 31.6 beds for every 1,000 senior citizens.

According to the report, China had about 460,000 orphans at the end of 2016, with 88,000 living in government-funded agencies, with the rest being cared for by relatives or private orphanages.

Some 19,000 Chinese orphans were adopted by domestic or overseas families in 2016, the ministry said."

From collision to cover-up: the inside story of the Chennai oil spill,"“This is a massive screw up,” said Abhijit Singh, who heads the Observer Research Foundation’s (ORF) Maritime Policy Initiative . “Something isn’t adding up. The initial reaction was very tardy and there was an attempt to hush up.”

What follows is the first detailed account of the collision and its aftermath, revealing a series of oversights and operational missteps that put India’s eastern coast at peril .

Port officials have prevaricated on everything from the quantity of oil spilt and the time needed for cleanup, to the long-term effects on the region’s fragile and besieged marine ecology.

A fortnight after the Dawn Kanchipuram spilt an estimated 75 tonnes of bunker oil — a heavy petroleum residue used to start ship engines — port authorities are yet to explain how two enormous tankers, each freighted with inflammable hydrocarbons, could collide three kilometres off the Chennai coastline.

The errors began as soon as the Maple left its berth. At Kamarajar Port, like elsewhere in the world, specialist navigators, called pilots, accompany large ships out to sea.

But according to a police report filed by A.K. Gupta, the port’s Director for Marine Services, the Maple let go of her pilot, V. Karunanidhi, well before his designated disembarkation point as Capt. Sahadevan was confident of navigating the ship by himself.

M.A. Bhaskarachar, Chairman and Managing Director of Kamarajar Port, said Karunanidhi continued to monitor the Maple’s progress and even messaged the Maple at 3:24 am to say: you are going to collide, be careful.

It is unclear if the Maple acknowledged this message. The ship stayed its course and continued to pick up speed until it collided, 20 minutes later, with the Kanchipuram at 3:45 am.

“Every harbour has its own idiosyncrasies. Captains, irrespective of experience, must rely on a pilot – those are the rules.” - Former harbour pilot

Once the collision occurred, the port’s pollution response fell apart.

The authorities claimed only one tonne oil had spilt, and then said 20 tonnes after the Coast Guard issued a separate statement. The final quantity of spilt oil, officials privately admit, could rise to 100 tonnes.

“The port should handle a spill of this size, but couldn’t. We came in because they asked us for help,” said a senior officer in the Coast Guard. “By then much of the damage was done.”

One plausible scenario is that the port panicked, sought to suppress news of the incident, and called the Coast Guard only once they realised the scale of the spill.

So when did port authorities learn of the accident?

“We cannot say anything, investigation is underway,” said A.K. Gupta, Kamarajar’s Director for Marine services. But a press release states the Coast Guard was informed at 6:15 am and spill containment measures began at 7 am, three hours after the incident.

This may seem like a short time, but experts disagree.

“If a tanker is involved, you need to send a team in half an hour,” said Singh, from the ORF, “These are standing operating procedures, it is not a discretionary decision.”

In 2012, the Indian government hired Saab, a Swedish military supplier, to set up a network of radars, radio receivers and cameras — called the National Automatic Identification System (NAIS) — to improve coastal surveillance in the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attack.

“The system can track anomalies and send alerts if a ship suddenly veers off course, or if a ship suddenly stops or collides,"" said an expert who has worked with the system, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive technology.

“The coastguard has a guy tracking the NAIS at all times,” said a retired Coast Guard official, noting that the NAIS has a centre in Chennai. “In this day and age, no one needs to inform anyone about anything, just look at your damn screen.”"
"Congress’s Kisan Sammelan to test its unity, poll readiness for 2018","Congress’s Kisan Sammelan (farmers’ convention) in Lahaar of Madhya Pradesh’s Bhind district, close to Gwalior, will signal its readiness for the 2018 assembly polls and also whether the party’s ‘Dabra’ spirit can be revived.

The ‘Dabra’ spirit is the holy grail for Congress unity. In 1993, the late Madhavrao Scindia initiated a conclave of senior Congress leaders in Dabra, a small town 45 km from Gwalior, just before the 1993 assembly elections where they managed to bury the hatchet and succeeded in coming to power besting the BJP.

The parallels are obvious. The ‘show’ at Laahar will be Madhavrao’s son, Jyotiraditya’s, and all senior Congress leaders, including former Union minister Kamal Nath, AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh, leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, senior state leader Suresh Pachauri, Congress state president Arun Yadav will be among the present.

The Scindias, erstwhile rulers of Gwalior state, have held sway in the entire region for decades even though BJP has been in power for the past 17 years in the state.

Also, Lahaar is Congress MLA Govind Singh’s constituency, and the fact that he is closer to Digvijaya Singh than Scindia has not gone unnoticed in political circles. Now, it remains to be seen how things pan out on the unity front.

Ajay Singh, son of late Congress leader Arjun Singh who was part of the Dabra conclave, told HT, “Though the Dabra spirit was of a different era, it is also true that for the past two-three months we are moving in that direction and the Lahaar convention is a step towards it.”

Loud and Visible

The preparations for the sammelan are visible all around. In Gwalior, posters portraying party unity span on the busy road outside the railway station and elsewhere in the city, appealing all to join the Kisan Sammelan.

Local rallies are being taken out by Congressmen, and several vehicles, with blaring loudspeakers reminding people of the convention, have been doing the rounds of the city for the past few days.

Over 2,000 vehicles will accompany Scindia’s rally from Gwalior to Lahaar and it will take around four hours to reach Lahar as all the leaders will be greeted at several places along the route.

Tapping into Farmers’ Anger

With the BJP government on the back foot, the rally, focussing on the farmers’ crisis, is aimed at the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls, 16 months away.

There is palpable anger among farmers, especially after the killing of six farmers in police firing and lathi-charge in Mandsaur in the first week of June. The farmers are demanding loan waiver and remunerative price for their crops.

State Congress spokesperson, K K Mishra said the party has been raising farmers’ issues through Kisan Sammelans and meetings in state in the past one month. “It started with Scindiaji’s satyagraha in Bhopal and was followed by kisan sammelans in Mhow, Khalghat and Mandsaur.”

After Lahar, two other Kisan Sammelans will be organised in Veerpur in Gwalior and Churhat in Sidhi district, which is Ajay Singh’s constituency.

BJP puts up brave front

The BJP too realises the Congress’s game plan and for the last one month the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been trying to douse the farmers’ anger through a slew of measures — visiting the families of those killed in police firing and announcing compensation of Rs 1 crore for them, purchasing onion at Rs 8 per kg, waiving power bills of small and marginal farmers, and taking out a Kisan Sandesh Yatra where party leaders meet farmers.

The BJP is officially trying to put up a brave front and is dismissive of the Congress.

BJP state spokesperson, Deepak Vijayvargiya says the Congress does not have credibility, leadership or organisation in the state.

“They are doing this with an eye on the polls, and not due to genuine concern for farmers,” he said."
"Microsoft: 500M Windows 10 devices, half of 2018 goal","Microsoft says a half billion devices are now running Windows 10, its latest operating system.

That’s up from 400 million disclosed last September, but far short of a goal of 1 billion by 2018. Microsoft has already acknowledged it won’t hit 1 billion in time . Getting halfway has taken nearly two years.

Windows 10 represents a comeback for Microsoft after a disastrous Windows 8 launch and heavy competition from phone systems such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. Getting more devices on Windows 10 will help encourage companies to make more apps and services for it.

CEO Satya Nadella disclosed the figure Wednesday at a Microsoft conference in Seattle.

After getting Microsoft on track to prioritizing mobile devices and internet-based services, Nadella says artificial intelligence will get a bigger focus."

However, it was Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane who did the bulk of the damage for the visitors. Both scored unbeaten centuries as Virat Kohli’s men ended the first day with seven wickets in hand and 344 on the board, putting Sri Lanka on the backfoot early in the second Test.

"Los Angeles to host 2028 Olympics, 2024 Games in Paris: Reports","Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics after reaching a deal with Olympic organisers, the Los Angeles Times reported on Monday, citing an unnamed source close to the negotiation.

The agreement paves the way for the 2024 Summer Games to be awarded to Paris. An announcement from the International Olympic Committee was expected later on Monday.

Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s office said he and other proponents of the city’s bid for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games would make an announcement to the news media at 5 p.m. PDT (0000 GMT).

A formal announcement about which city would host and when was not expected until September when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is set to meet in September in Lima, Peru.

Los Angeles had argued that it could host a low-cost Olympics given that it already has all the necessary infrastructure in place, while Paris would need to build several expensive structures.

But recent bids by Paris had been passed over and many felt the French capital was due to get the nod for the 2024 Games, which will mark 100 years since the last time it hosted a Games.

Garcetti in June had indicated that while Los Angeles would prefer to host the Games in 2024, it was not opposed to playing host in 2028."
New 2017 Honda Civic spotted at Tapukara factory: When is it coming to India?,"Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) offers a mid-size sedan City and also a high-end luxury sedan Accord Hybrid, but the love and eagerness for the new Civic in India has been surprising.

And after spotting this 2017 avatar of the Civic at Honda’s Tapukara factory in Rajasthan, we are convinced: The Civic will make a comeback.

The 2017 Civic is launched in various global markets, and it is expected to come to India soon. (Gulshankumar Wankar / HT Photo)

“So far we have not heard any negative feedback about the Civic,” Yoichiro Ueno, president and CEO of HCIL, told HT during our visit to the factory on Wednesday.

“I see a lot of people in my neighbourhood still driving the old Civic with lots of care and love. May be the cars are getting older. So if a replacement car is launched, those customers will also love it,” he added.

The Honda Civic was first launched in 2006 in the lower D segment. The Civic was available in the 1.8-litre i-VTEC petrol engine, in both manual as well as automatic transmissions.

It won several industry awards including the Indian Car of the Year (ICOTY) 2007 and topped the JD Power Initial Quality Study in 2010.

But sales in the lower D segment, of Toyota Corolla and Hyundai Elantra, fell by 29% in 2012-13 over the previous year; Honda itself managed to sell only 685 Civics -- almost 70% fewer -- during the same period. So Honda pulled the Civic out of the market in 2013.

Globally, the 2017 edition launched in various avatars has garnered great feedback -- Civic Coupe, Civic 4-door sedan, Civic 4-door hatchback and a sports version Civic Type R.

So when is the new Civic coming to India?

The most convincing answer Honda could give us was: “Soon may be. We are getting a lot of enquiries. We are finishing our assessment. It takes time.”

Market speculations say the new version would come around the festive season later this year or during the Delhi Auto Expo in February 2018.

Multiple HCIL personnel told HT the model spotted at the Honda factory was imported from Japan for “research purposes only”, “to evaluate the parts” and “testing”.

It could be this specimen that would be replicated to make the future Civics for India. HT also learnt that the new Civic would be made at Honda’s Greater Noida factory, where the carmaker produces the premium sports utility vehicle CR-V, the compact urban hatchback Brio, the compact sedan Amaze and the new Honda City."
Cannes 2017: Now Godard reframed by The Artist director Michael Hazanavicius,"One remembers French director Michael Hazanavicius’s The Artist, a beautiful black and white portrait of the silent Hollywood. He has now returned to the Cannes Film Festival – six years later that is – with his yet another gripping work, Redoubtable. A wonderful tribute to Jean-Luc Godard, Redoubtable has been adapted from a biography of the celebrated auteur penned by his former wife, Anne Wiazemsky.

A still from Redoubtable.

Hazanavicius’ movie revolves around the time when Godard was helming what is famously known as his revolutionary work, La Chinoise. The time was 1967, a turbulent period in French history, which saw a workers’ demonstration followed by a serious student unrest.

As the Festival enters its sixth day on Monday, Redoubtable has been one of the few films that impressed this critic. It has been executed with remarkable finesse, has noteworthy performances and it narrates the story of a marriage gone sour at times when the French literary circles were driven by unending contradictions. Godard was an integral part of it.

What is the story all about? Godard’s short but passionate marriage to an actress – who later became a fiction writer -- Anne Wiazemsky. She was almost 20 years younger than Godard, and was everything that the man was not. He was brooding, critical, restrictively conservative when it came to her (there is a scene where he asks Anne not to do a movie because every scene has a nude shot of her’s and well, the poor director changes his script to have only the hero strip – a hilarious take that it then becomes) and so damn difficult when it came to other aspects of life and living.

In fact, much of the film is based on Anne’s biography, titled Un An Apres (One Year Later), and much of the celluloid work is seen from her point of view. She narrates much of it, indeed.

Godard was 37, and Anne barely 19, and the auteur was passing through a troublesome phase in his career. He was making La Chinoise, a movie influenced by Mao. She was acting in it, but when the the film runs into rough weather critically, Godard gets moody and irritable and argumentative. “Nobody can win an argument with you” says one of his friends.

The movie’s failure was followed by the unrest in 1968 – a year that saw Godard and his friends like Francois Truffaut storming the Cannes Film Festival and forcing it to pull its curtains down, One is told that Truffaut, who had been declared persona non-grant by the Festival because of his acerbic criticism of French cinema, sneaked into Cannes to cause mayhem. Both felt that Cannes should not run when there was so much suffering all around.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe.

At home, Godard was facing his own little tempest, and the relationship with Anne was hitting the rocks.

All this has been pictured most realistically – with a touch of wit and sarcasm (one often felt that the film was also an indictment of all things wrong with the French society then). We clearly see Godard’s fear of ageing , his nagging doubts about his own creative ability and his narcissistic tendencies. All these rob his life and marriage of peace – the political storm outside his home adding to his own disquiet.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe. For much like Satyajit Ray and Tagore – who have been deeply ingrained in the psyche of an average Indian (certainly Bengali) – Godard and Truffaut will remain forever in these parts of the world.

And this is precisely what Hazanavicius told the media soon after his movie was screened on Saturday night. “Anybody making cinema today owes something to Jean-Luc Godard. He unlocked so many doors, created so many spaces and made cinema possible for many people”.

Anne’s account gives the movie a kind of rare insightfulness. “The intelligence of Anne Wiazemsky’s account lies in the way she manages to retain the aspect of an intimate diary. She doesn’t recount the story from the point of view of the woman she is now, but rather the woman she was then. There is a real Jean-Luc Godard who exists, but no one really knows him. My aim is not to create a carbon copy of Godard. I am inventing Jean-Luc Godard out of the Jean-Luc Godard created by Jean-Luc Godard. Anne Wiazemsky’s account is another variation of a Jean-Luc Godard also created by Jean-Luc Godard”, the director quipped.

Finally, one can say with a lot of conviction that Hazanavicius has managed to make a film on a subject as heavy as Godard with a breeze. Nowhere did this critic feel Redoubtable too heavy or languid. Rather, it was lighthearted and even funny. Not an easy task, though.

Mumbai court convicts 15 Somali pirates in 2011 case,"A session court in Mumbai convicted 15 Somali pirates for 7 years of imprisonment in a 2011 case. The pirates had taken 22 people aboard a commercial ship from Thailand hostage. They have been found guilty of attempt to murder and kidnapping.

This is one of the four cases registered in 2011 against a total of 120 Somali pirates, for holding 91 people from different countries hostage.

The sessions court pronounced the verdict in the first of the four cases, where the pirates’ mother vessel carrying heavy arms and ammunitions was intercepted in 2011, and the pirates were caught.

The coast guard and navy, in a joint operation, then rescued the 22 men being held hostage on the ship. The men were Thai nationals and the ship was called Prantalaya. They also captured the 15 Somali pirates who jumped into the sea and took them into custody.

The vessel had been captured by the pirates in 2010. They had been using it as their mother vessel since then."
"Medical devices to carry MRP on packs from January 1, 2018: Govt","Medical devices will have to mandatorily carry maximum retail price (MRP) on packages from January 1, 2018, the government informed Parliament on Tuesday.

Minister of state for road transport and highways, shipping and chemicals and fertilisers Mansukh L Mandaviya said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha that the move followed amendments to the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011.

He said the consumer affairs, food and public distribution ministry has issued amendments making the rules “applicable to medical devices also”.

“The rules make printing and labelling of MRP on the package mandatory. These rules shall be applicable from 1.1.2018,” Mandaviya said.

He was responding to a query on whether any guideline was likely to be issued or has been issued by the ministry for medical devices to declare MRP.

The minister further said that under the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, every package must bear the name, address, telephone number, e-mail of persons or of office that can be contacted in case of consumer complaints.

“The amended rules shall be applicable to e-commerce companies also,” he said.

In March, drug price regulator NPPA had stated that the 22 medical devices which have been notified as ‘drugs’ must all carry MRP on packs.

These devices included heart valves, surgical dressings, condoms, stents, disposable hypodermic syringes and orthopaedic implants, among others."
Cannes 2017: Naomi Kawase’s Radiance is radiantly refreshing,"The Japanese director, Naomi Kawase, is a Cannes Film Festival veteran, and has had several of her movies play here. She has also been on Cinefondation and Short Film Jury in 2016. Her 2015 Sweet Bean (An in Japanese) - which was part of the festival’s A Certain Regard -- was a extraordinarily touching story of an old woman who helps a dorayaki shop to become popular with her yummy bean paste.

Equally moving is Kawase’s latest, Radiance (Hikari in Japanese), where the auteur takes us into the world of the blind and partially-sighted -- tracing the relationship between a photographer whose vision is fading and a woman who pens movie audio descriptions.

Kawase uses disability most artfully to weave a love story between Misako (Misaki Ayame) - who is writing a description for the visually challenged -- and Nakamori (Nagase Masatoshi), a celebrated photographer. He is one of Misako’s listeners. On the verge of blindness, he is caustic and angry. Misako has her own tragedies to grapple with: a father who mysteriously disappeared several years ago and a mother sinking into dementia. Perhaps these misfortunes push her to understand Nakamori’s frustration.

Radiance is a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr.

Radiance -- Kawase’s fifth work to debut in the festival’s Competition and a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr -- draws us softly into Nakamori’s and Misako’s world that sees disillusionment, rage and arguments till a chance meeting pulls them towards each other. An emotionally charged scene in which he feels her face is far more erotic than a kiss they share later.

Brilliantly photographed in soft light, Radiance is a work that haunts us with its delicate treatment and subtle messages. Something that is a typical Kawase, whose Radiance loyally follows in the path of her many films in the past, particular Sweet Bean.

A decade of soaring Delhi University cutoffs,"If you scored less than 70% in Class 12, this year you have close to 26 options across Delhi University colleges. Only subjects offered — Hindi, Sanskrit and Urdu.

A decade ago, you had at least 120 — the options, slight more diverse, with subject choices such as History and Political Science as well.

As senior secondary board examinations across the country keep seeing rising scores due to moderation, Delhi University cutoffs keep increasing to accommodate only a limited number of students on the top.

While the Commerce courses have historically been in the 85+ bracket, the rise of Humanities has emerged only in the recent years. Today, courses like History and Political Science require as many marks as one would need for popular courses like Economics.

This year, over 60% of Delhi University cutoffs for the general category have crossed the 90% mark. In 2008, this figure was merely at 8%.

Additional Research: Manas SharmaNote: Data was collated from the Delhi University website and HT archives. All cutoffs are from the first list and indicate the minimum score required in the general category. There is no data for several courses such as B.A. (P) in 2013 due to the introduction of FYUP.

‘End of combustion engine-powered car’: Volvo to go all electric from 2019,"Geely-owned Volvo Car Group said on Wednesday all new models launched from 2019 will be fully electric or hybrids, spelling the eventual end to nearly a century of Volvos powered solely by the internal combustion engine.

The Gothenburg-based company will continue to produce pure combustion-engine Volvos from models launched before that date, but said it would introduce cars across its model line-up that ranged from fully electric cars to plug-in hybrids.

Volvo’s plans make it the first major traditional automaker to set a date for the complete phase-out of combustion-engine-only models though electrification has long been a buzzword across the industry and Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one.

“This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,” Volvo Cars chief executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.

Five new models set to be launched in 2019 through 2021 - three of them Volvos and two Polestar-branded - will all be fully or partially electric.

“These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models,” Volvo said.

“This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor.”

Volvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz and BMW.

Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies which allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars.

Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division.

Volvo has also taken steps towards an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares last year, though the company has said no decision on an IPO has been made."

Supreme Court questions HC for reopening one 1984 riot case after 31 years,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday questioned the Delhi High Court’s decision to reopen a 31-year-old case related to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots against former MLA Mahender Yadav, who was acquitted of the charges.

A bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra remarked: “Under what procedure has it been done? On what basis this order has been passed? Rightly or wrongly this man was acquitted in 1986 and none challenged the judgment for more than 30 years.” The court was hearing Yadav’s appeal against the order.

“All of a sudden in some other matter, this order is passed. Under what process of law the high court can unsettle it?” it asked. The court, however, did not stay the order.

Yadav’s counsel senior advocate Sultan Singh expressed apprehension that some coercive action might be taken against his client. “Its a case of Section 302 (murder),” he submitted. “Nothing will happen. Its only a show cause notice,” the bench told him, allaying his fears.

Senior advocate HS Phoolka, representing the riot victims, justified the HC order. He claimed eyewitnesses were not summoned and the trial was closed in three months. The high court had cited Zahira Sheikh’s case in the 2002 Gujarat riots as a precedent.

But the bench was unconvinced. “In that case (Zahira Sheikh’s case) someone had challenged the order. Here no one challenged it…Judges should not involved themselves in such cases,” the court told Phoolka.

A bench headed by acting chief justice of the high court, Gita Mittal, had in March 2017 sought to reopen the trial in five 1984 anti-Sikh riots’ cases in which all the accused were acquitted in 1986. It issued notice to five persons, including Yadav.

Perhaps the matter was decided in a hurry, the HC, which took cognizance of the cases on its own, had observed.

In a related development, the SC was informed that 51 more cases related to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots were closed by a special investigation team (SIT) set up by the Narendra Modi government to reinvestigate them, taking the total number of such cases to 250.

Almost 3,000 people were killed, most of them in Delhi, in the anti-Sikh riots that broke out following the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984.

Senior counsel Arvind Datar, who represented petitioner Gurnad Singh, told the bench that only nine cases were on. He demanded that the trial in these cases should be conducted on a day-to-day basis.

The court, however, adjourned the matter to August 16 after additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta sought time to take instructions in the matter."
"India vs Sri Lanka: Hosts eye redemption, visitors look for series win","Sri Lanka have a lot to prove when they take on India in the second Test at their official cricket headquarters – the Sinhalese Sports Club. Annihilated in the opening contest of the series, the home team’s pride has been pricked, being outplayed in all departments.

For the visitors, the No 1 side in the world for a while now, the thrust will be on consistency, which is the hallmark of champion sides.

The threat to the series is how predictable it might get unless Sri Lanka improve drastically. But there are few signs to point towards that after the debacle in Galle.

Seldom has there been such a one-sided game in the history of India-Sri Lanka cricket, least of all at home for the island nation.

CHANDIMAL BACK

In this backdrop, Dinesh Chandimal will be back at the helm, and the enormity of the task is not lost on the skipper. Facing Virat Kohli’s India in sub-continental conditions is a task the best of the teams dread, and so far Sri Lanka have looked a shadow of the team they were in the last series in 2015.

However, India won’t expect an easy outing as Chandimal’s addition will lend steel to the middle order.

SHARP PACE

The last time Kohli & Co played here, the wicket tested the technique of batsmen with pacers enjoying assistance on all four days. This time, Sri Lanka cannot afford that option. Historically, India’s batting and spin bowling have been strong, but this side gets its edge from its pace attack. Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav are incisive with the new ball and skillful with the old ball. They have a good back-up in Hardik Pandya.

DRY SURFACE

The home team is expected to gamble with spin, captain Dinesh Chandimal hinting at handing a debut to left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara to support Rangana Herath and Dilruwan Perera.

It remains to be seen if India will counter the move by adding chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav or rely on spin twins R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.

READ | Virat Kohli’s India face ‘problem of plenty’ in opening combination vs Sri Lanka

TOSS FACTOR

The toss will be a crucial factor, as seen in Galle where India batted first to bury the opposition under runs. If the SSC plays to its nature, it can be hard work for the bowlers. It is a surface where batsmen love to bat --- Mahela Jayawardene has 11 Test hundreds on his home ground and Sachin Tendulkar averaged 99.71 with four hundreds in five Tests.

PUJARA’S 50TH

While the might of this India batting line-up is a challenge for any attack, the Sri Lanka think-tank will spend considerable energy planning for Cheteshwar Pujara. Kohli had started the home season as the premier batsman of the team, a wicket every team wanted desperately early on. But since the last four Tests, Pujara has put a price on his wicket. The numbers tell the tale, a match-winning 92 at Bangalore, double century at Ranchi and 153 in the opening Test at Galle. He will have added inspiration here as it is his 50th Test.

"With pastures for cattle shrinking, India may have to import milk by 2021","India may have to import milk in four years, if it cannot increase fodder supply for its 299 million cattle, as rising pressure on land reduces pastures nationwide.

Spurred by rising incomes, a growing population and changing food preferences, the demand for milk and milk products will grow to at least 210 million tonnes by 2021–22, a rise of 36% over five years, according to government estimates. To meet this demand, production must grow by 5.5% per annum, according to the State of India’s Livelihood (SOIL) report. In 2014-15 and 2015-16, milk production grew at 6.2% and 6.3%, respectively.

To boost milk yield, India would need to generate 1,764 million tonnes of fodder by 2020, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of government data. But existing sources can only manage about 900 million tonnes of fodder–a shortage of 49%.

Demand for private consumption has risen from 5% per annum in the period 1998-2005 to 8.5% per annum between 2005 and 2012, according to an Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, report.

This demand and supply gap has pushed up milk prices by an average of 16% per annum, according to the according to the 2015 SOIL report.

States with top milk yields have more pastures

In the decade to 2015, milk production went up 59% from 92 million tonnes to 146 million tonnes in 2015. But fodder shortages may knock India off its position as the world’s top milk producer (it contributes nearly 17% of global production).

The milk productivity of India’s livestock is less than half (48%) of the global average: 987 kg per lactation compared to the global average of 2,038 kg per lactation.

The availability and quality of fodder has a direct bearing on the quantity and quality of milk productivity, the data show. All the three states that topped milk productivity in terms of gram per day–Rajasthan (704), Haryana (877) and Punjab (1,032)–had earmarked more than 10% of their cultivable land for pastures, according to the 2015 SOIL report. The national average is 337.

Currently, all three types of fodder are in short supply–green (63%), dry (24%) and concentrates (76%). Only 4% of total cultivable land in India is used for fodder production, a proportion that has remained stagnant for the last four decades.

Demand And Supply Of Fodder: An Estimate

Considering the demand for milk, land under fodder production needs to be doubled, according to this December 2016 report of the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture.

Shortages are forcing states to now source fodder from elsewhere. “The quality of fodder is a concern. We are now looking to source fodder from Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh),” said Sudhir Mishra, who runs a dairy farm in Ranchi (Jharkhand).

But major portions of grazing lands have either been degraded or encroached upon, according to the Parliamentary Committee report.

However, the availability of crop residues, the largest single source of fodder, has been impacted by increasing pressure on land and the replacement of traditional cereal crops, especially coarse ones. Crop residue includes coarse and fine straws, leguminous and pulses straws.

Given the importance of food and cash crops, it is very unlikely that the area under fodder cultivation will increase substantially, the parliamentary committee report said.

“If India fails to achieve substantial production growth, the country would need to resort to significant imports from the world market which has the potential to cause prices to spurt since India is a large consumer,” said 2015 SOIL report.

To cut costs, easy access to fodder is important for small farmers

Feed cost constitutes about 60-70% of operating expenses on dairy farms. Nearly 70% of India’s milk production comes from small and marginal farmers, who depend on homegrown fodder. Unlike big operators like Mishra, they cannot afford to buy fodder from other states.

Take the case of Dundappa Patil, a 10th-class pass from Belagavi in North Karnataka, who took a loan of Rs 35,000 for dairy farming eight years ago.

The process of applying and getting a loan for the enterprise was simple and quick because Patil was covered by a scheme for unemployed youth in Karnataka. He went through a crash course in dairy farming in Belagavi and in less than a month, set up business with four buffalo.

Patil’s target was to sell 20 litres of milk every day to a local co-operative society. But the yield per buffalo on Patil’s farm was less than 2 litres a day; his buffalo produced less than half the milk he hoped they would.

“I realised that just buying a good buffalo was not enough, quality and quantity of fodder too had to be good,” he said. “You have to be ready to spend a lot of time and money on sourcing fodder.”

Patil said he and other villagers were using a common pasture on a hill 5 km from the village. “But that is seasonal and not enough for the all the village cattle,” he said.

So, he tried buying the fodder, but then the business did not look viable.

The contribution of livestock to the incomes of landless and small farmers ranges between 20-50%, and the poorer the family, the greater the potential of dairy farming’s contribution to livelihood, according to the SOIL report.

Unlike agriculture, which tends to be seasonal, dairy farming provides returns through the year. It can minimise the risks agricultural households face when they run short of cash.

In Belgavi, that scenario did not work for Patil because he could not overcome the fodder shortage–an issue India must address if it is to be self-sufficient in milk and dairy farming is to succeed.

Eventually, after a year, Patil sold the buffalo and repaid half the loan. The bank waived the rest after failing to recover it. Today, he is a construction worker in Belagavi city.

"Chipmaker Nvidia, Volvo, AutoLiv team up to develop self-driving vehicles by 2021","Chipmaker Nvidia Corp on Monday announced it was partnering with Volvo Cars and Swedish auto supplier Autoliv to develop self-driving car technology for vehicles due to hit the market by 2021.

Volvo is owned by China’s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd .

The Silicon Valley-based Nvidia also announced a non-exclusive partnership with German automotive suppliers ZF and Hella for artificial intelligence technology for autonomous driving.

Nvidia came to prominence in the gaming industry for designing graphics processing chips, but in recent years has been a key player in the automotive sector for providing the so-called “brain” of the autonomous vehicle.

The company, whose many partners already include Tesla Inc, Toyota Motor Corp and tier one supplier Robert Bosch, announced its latest deals at an automotive electronics show in Ludwigsburg, Germany.

Nvidia’s Drive PX artificial intelligence platform is used by Tesla in its Models S and X and upcoming Model 3 electric vehicles. Volkswagen AG’s Audi is also using the system to reach full autonomous driving by 2020.

In a call with reporters, Nvidia’s senior automotive director Danny Shapiro said carmakers and their main suppliers are now moving away from the research and development phase of autonomous vehicles and into concrete production plans.

The system developed jointly by ZF and Hella, and using Nvidia’s Drive PX platform, will combine front cameras with radar and software to create technology meeting the Euro NCAP safety certification for so-called “Level 3” driving, in which some, but not all, driving is performed by the car.

Volvo is already using the Drive PX for the self-driving cars in its “Drive Me” autonomous pilot program.

Volvo’s production vehicles built on Nvidia’s platform, as announced on Monday, are planned for sale by 2021."

MP: Fugitive ‘king of Dewas’ surrenders over farmer’s murder in 2015,"Vikram Singh Puar, the 27-year-old son of the deceased “king” of the former Dewas royals in Madhya Pradesh, surrendered on Wednesday after being on the run for more than a year for his suspected role in a murder.

He has been accused of leading a fatal clash with 12 armed supporters over a land dispute in Raghogarh village, about 40km from Dewas.

Puar and his gang allegedly tried to take away the wheat harvest of a farmer, Pratap Lodhi, on March 19, 2015. Lodhi and his family members resisted and, in the ensuing clash with firearms and lathis, the farmer was gravely wounded. He died on March 22.

The young former royal was on the run since then and a special court granted him anticipatory bail for 15 days in June 2016 as his father, former BJP minister Tukojirao Puar, was in his death bed.

His bail application was approved so that he could perform last rites of his father who died of brain haemorrhage on June 19. A day later, Puar was crowned “King of Dewas” at a private ceremony in the family’s palace.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, home minister Babulal Gaur and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had attended the senior Puar’s funeral.

The new “king”, however, escaped and remained in hiding until he surrendered before a judicial magistrate on Wednesday.

Dewas police arrested Puar at a local hospital where he was admitted earlier in the day. The magistrate sent him to judicial custody till January 7.

Superintendent of police Shashikant Shukla said Puar’s police remand was not sought because “there was nothing to recover from him”.

But several questions remained unanswered: Where was the fugitive hiding? What was he doing? Who was he with? Who all helped him helped him during the period?

A murder charge has been registered at Barotha police station in Dewas after the farmer’s death. But a court acquitted 12 of the 13 accused last December, making the case weak against Puar, legal experts said.

India vs Sri Lanka: KL Rahul enjoys every knock like it’s his last,"Spending more than four months out of action can make you desperate; it can also make you determined. The strong resolve in KL Rahul’s batting was there to see on the first morning of the second Test against Sri Lanka on Thursday.

In great form, Rahul braved a shoulder injury to play crucial knocks in the home Test series win against Australia in March and then underwent surgery. He missed the first Test in Galle, India’s first series since the home matches, due to fever.

While his opening partner Shikhar Dhawan batted without a care in the world, going for his shots from the start, Rahul was resolute and prepared to wait for the right delivery. It helped him complete his sixth successive half-century (57), and seventh in eight innings, till an unfortunate run out.

Team contribution matters

“Not being able to play cricket was tough, but once I am back I am really happy; and even happier I could start off with a fifty and make some contribution to the team,” said Rahul, looking satisfied after making a successful comeback.

“I have been injured a few times, which is very unfortunate and which is very disappointing. But each time I have come back, I have come back more hungry. It’s (injuries) kind of taught me to value my position, value my opportunities each time I go out to the middle. I enjoy it and play it like it is my last game. That’s something that has really worked for me.”

For someone who had been out for long, the impressive part about Rahul’s game was how he straightaway found his rhythm, sure of his footwork and shot selection. It pointed to his strong basics. While sharing his frustration at not being able to do anything during the recovery process, Rahul spoke about how it helps analyse other batsmen’s game.

“When you are sitting out and when you are seeing your teammates doing well, you do feel very happy but you also feel disappointed that it’s not you in that position doing the job for the country. Whatever time I have spent away from the game, I have watched the guys batting. Not just our guys but I watch a lot of cricket, I see the guys and see what they are doing right and I try to bring that into my game.”

Happy to be back

Asked how significant his innings was, Rahul said he was very happy the minute he walked into the middle.

“It’s a big challenge, very unfortunate I had to sit out for so long. At such a young age how do you keep yourself positive, how do you keep yourself focused, and still motivated to come back as soon as you can… but the minute I walked out to the middle, I was very happy, more than anything else. Whether I did well or didn’t, it didn’t matter because I was very happy.”

The only concern for Rahul will be the inability to convert his fifty into three figures. “Disappointing that I have not been able to convert that, but that will keep me more hungry. Each time I go back to bat, I will want to get more and more runs. I’m learning from my mistakes. Each time I’ve done a silly mistake and that’s how it is.”

On the reaction to his run out -- Rahul gestured to partner Cheteshwar Pujara that ‘it was my call’ -- he said, “I wasn’t disappointed about that. I was disappointed because I have been away from the game so long and I didn’t want to get out at all.”"

Makeshift the ground on which we stand: Eunice de Souza (1940-2017),"Even before I met Eunice de Souza, she had me overawed, and more than slightly terrified of her. I later found out this was the natural state of being for generations of her students, who encountered the stylish, unconventional, constantly challenging professor of English in her classrooms throughout an influential 30-year career at St. Xavier’s College in Mumbai. But I studied abroad and was never her student. Instead, de Souza first confronted me in books, most memorably her debut volume of poetry, the mesmerizing ‘Fix’ (Newground, 1979).

That slender collection of just 24, mostly short, poems accosted my consciousness like an ear-splitting thunderclap. It was at once confounding and irresistible, utterly beguiling but also deeply unsettling. For starters, I couldn’t get over the Arun Kolatkar-designed cover, with its silver monochrome portrait of unblinking Eunice close up, with an X etched on her forehead, the instantly obvious reference being to Charles Manson, who had carved up his own face to “secede from the human race.” And then, as I turned the pages gasping at poem after razor-sharp poem, de Souza radically and permanently disturbed my sense of self, cutting mercilessly to the bone to upend any number of cosy certainties.

The cover of Fix (1979) (www.Amazon.in)

In just a couple days after her death, a host of moving tributes have illuminated what it was like to have Eunice as a colleague, as an inspirational (and irascible) teacher, as mentor and friend and ally. Almost every one of these testimonials has been written by a woman. But what was it like to have to deal with Eunice de Souza as an unconsciously (innocently?) privileged Goan Catholic male, thus the prime target of her most acid verse? Let me tell you, it never stops being highly uncomfortable. For me, reading Eunice de Souza has always felt uncannily like having my pants pulled off in public, and then receiving an unending succession of stinging kicks to the rear. At first you gasp and squirm, but then eventually become resigned to the inevitable. Finally, as I once confided to Eunice at the end of a long evening, I’ve come to expect and rather enjoy the unmanning and pasting. That quasi-masochistic confidence delighted her no end.

Forgive Me, Mother(Fix, 1979)

Forgive me, mother,

That I left you

a life-long widow

old, alone

It was kill or die

and you got me anyway:

The blood congeals at lover’s touch

The guts dissolve in shit.

I was never young.

Now I’m old, alone

In dreams

I hack you.

If there is a unifying theme to Eunice de Souza’s life and lengthy intellectual progression, it is liberation, rigorously essayed at almost any cost. Her emancipatory journey began immediately after school, when she decamped from Poona’s increasingly stifling Goan Catholic community to study at the University of Bombay (she earned a BA (Hons) in English Literature in 1960). Having lost her father at the age of three, the future poet hated growing up in a small-minded, gossipy and judgemental small town universe, where she stood out for being raised by a widowed, embittered mother under somewhat straitened circumstances. That alienating experience never left her, and underlies a considerable portion of her oeuvre.

Unerringly independent of mind, and already possessed of blood-curdling sardonicism, de Souza rapidly achieved notoriety amongst the parochial Aunties and Uncles of Goan Catholic Poona. My mother and uncles grew up with her, and can easily recall the stirs she generated by speaking out in school, and for cultivating adult relationships with proto-bohemians like the Shantiniketan-trained artist, Angelo da Fonseca. Not much later, she wrote a poem that stayed unpublished for decades, “I want a father/always have./God won’t do/He’s too judgemental./And so I found you/ Like my father, absent.”

This, in her own words, is another major theme of de Souza’s life. That is, her ambivalent passion for male company, complete with vulnerability to every kind of disappointment, and a correspondingly deadly eye for weakness, hypocrisy and cant. She truly loved men, that much is more than clear from her writings. But that sentiment was balanced with brutal honesty about their fumbling and foibles, as well as an incandescent ire about the injustice of the way the world works to undermine and sideline her own sex. In important early poems from ‘Fix’ like ‘Bandra Christian Party’, ‘Marriages are Made’ and, most vividly, ‘Catholic Wife’, one or another pompous Goan Catholic “pillar of the church” stands in for all patriarchal hypocrites, while “the pillar’s wife says nothing.”

In 2012, speaking to a rapt and adoring audience in Panjim, the pocket-sized Latinate capital of Goa, de Souza explained, “When I wrote a number of poems, critical in some ways of Goans, I had Poona Goans in mind because those were the ones I knew. Rather like Irish Catholic families, they encouraged parents to have large families, they were concerned with the colour of one’s skin, the wickedness of even knowing about sex. To know about sex was to be ‘sophisticated,’ and that was the most damning word one could apply to a girl. It was some time before I recognized that these were shortcomings we shared with every other community. Nevertheless, I was told by a student that a priest has denounced them from a pulpit at St Peter’s in Bandra. When I told the poet Adil Jussawalla this he said if I continued in the way I was going, I would soon be denounced from St Peter’s in Rome!”

By that point, the feared dragon lady of St Xavier’s was several years into retirement, and allegedly mellowed beyond the recognition of her former pupils. If that is indeed true, I am extremely fortunate it is when our own connection took place. With some trepidation about what might ensue, I was responsible for inviting Eunice for her first-ever reading of her poems in her ancestral homeland on the sidelines of a path-breaking, monumental art exhibition, ‘Aparanta: The Confluence of Contemporary Art in Goa’ curated by Ranjit Hoskote in 2007. In the event, she was disarmingly charming in person, and altogether radiant on stage. None of us could get enough, and she knew it.

Very late one evening on that trip, on a candle lit terrace overlooking the Arabian Sea, de Souza spoke with great feeling about ‘ways of belonging’ that characterized the many-layered relationship she had with her roots, with complicated implications for how Goa finds meaning within modern India. That conversation led to a new, unique Goa Art + Literature Festival focused on what is usually called “the margins” - Goa, Kashmir, the North East states, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as genres like poetry, translations and graphic novels. Eunice repeatedly presided at the annual event with notable pleasure, earning herself a legion of new fans including Khasi rock legend, Lou Majaw (who followed her around like a hefty puppy for days), and then-Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah (who was photographed looking like a mouse transfixed next to Eunice, rendered helpless by her feline, feminine wiles).

India has been scandalously cavalier to the pioneering Indo-Anglian poets, for outdated and hopelessly misguided nationalistic reasons. It was several years after Arun Kolatkar’s death that his genius was adequately recognized, typically disgracefully only after his work was published to great acclaim in the USA. There is no doubt in my mind the same will happen to Eunice de Souza’s poems, which have a rare universal quality that seem to me inherently resistant to becoming dated. They will last, with impact undimmed, as one of the vital modernist artistic achievements of independent India.

However, it is as anthologist that Eunice truly stands alone. Over decades of spirited labour, she unearthed and revived the work of a prodigious number of overlooked and forgotten writers. Our understanding of the breadth of Indian literature is incalculably enriched by books like ‘Purdah: An Anthology’ (OUP, 2004), ‘Women’s Voices: Selections from Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century Indian Writing in English’ (OUP, 2004), and ‘Early Indian Poetry in English: An Anthology 1829-1947’ (OUP, 2005). As she explained in the introduction to the latter volume, she was motivated to “re-map” comprehensively. “Literary battles take place in every culture, colonized and colonizing, and class, region, gender and religion all come into play when deciding who or what creates a nation’s identity, who speaks for it. It is my impression that, in India at least, the battle too often takes precedence over the actual reading of texts. In fact, come of it takes place without texts being read at all.”

Eunice de Souza’s last collection of poems (www.Amazon.in)

It is both typical and maddening of Eunice to have departed a lifetime of burrowing through mountains of archives, while leaving behind just a few slim books of poetry for us who remain. I remember her laughing inscrutably at my suggestion that she was the only writer in the world whose collected works actually dwindled quite appreciably over the years, as lines were re-assessed then deleted, and some poems discreetly abandoned in toto. She was the knife whittling to the irreducible, always trying to distill an encompassing world view to a few spare lines. That microcosmic impulse is particularly evident in her last book of poems, the wry, luminous ‘Learn from the Almond Leaf’ where a poet at the height of her powers returns often to the prospect of the end. All those who knew Eunice de Souza realize this wasn’t an accident. It’s just that she couldn’t trust anyone else to do clear-eyed justice to her epitaph.

Another Poem About Death (Learn from the Almond Leaf, Poetrywala 2016)

I keep hearing sounds

Of wind and water.

There is no wind.

There is no water.

There is no air.

I see the pallor on her face

The hardening hand

I know

There is no one there.
