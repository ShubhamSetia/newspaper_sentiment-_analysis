Major Pandey lays down life fighting terrorists in Shopian,"Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 3

A pall of gloom descended on Haldwani in the Kumaon division of Uttarakhand as soon as the news of martyrdom of Major Kamlesh Pandey in Kashmir spread in the region. Major Pandey attained martyrdom fighting terrorists at Shopian in Jammu and Kashmir today. Major Pandey’s family stays at Himmatpur Mohalla in Haldwani. His father Mohan Chandra Pandey is an ex-serviceman. The family hails from Almora district. Kamlesh did his primary schooling from his hometown. He passed Class XII from Kendriya Vidhyalaya, Ranikhet. Starting his career in the defence services as an Airman in 2006, a hard working Kamlesh continued with his studies and did his graduation. He then cleared the Combined Defence Services and became a commissioned officer in the Army in 2010. Kamlesh was promoted to the rank of Major a few months ago. Shanti Pandey, Kamlesh’s mother, was in a state of shock. A large number of Haldwani residents visited Kamlesh’s residence to offer their condolences."

Sampla (Rohtak), August 7

When BSF Head Constable Rai Singh of Kheri Sampla village of Rohtak was killed in shelling by Pakistani forces during a ceasefire violation in Rajouri sector of Jammu and Kashmir in November last year, the Haryana Government had said a memorial for him would be built soon.

In December, the Sampla Municipal Committee also passed a resolution unanimously that Rai Singh’s memorial would be constructed at the site where he was cremated.

The committee also resolved to name a park in Ward No. 2 after the martyr. However, no memorial has been established for the martyr till date.

Rai Singh’s widow Sunita and his brother Ramesh said the state government had announced that a park named after Rai Singh would be constructed and his statue installed, but the project was being put off on some pretext or the other.

Rai Singh belonged to a Dalit family and was the only earning member of his family.

The financial compensation announced by the Haryana Government for his family members was also provided after several months, and that too after the matter was highlighted by the media.

The martyr’s widow has got her first pension only recently, more than eight months after her husband was killed."
"NGT raps Punjab, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan on crop-burning","The National Green Tribunal has rapped four northern states--Punjab, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan--for not submitting action plans to prevent pollution emanating from crop burning after the harvesting season. A bench, headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar, warned the state governments that if they failed to comply with its directions, it would order attachment of the treasury account of the states. “Despite our judgment and subsequent orders, the state governments have failed to comply with the directions and take preventive precautionary and controlling measures for air pollution resulting from crop residue burning.

“We grant last and final opportunity requiring them, at least, to file action plans with complete accountability and elements of performance, within one week...(If) compliance is not made, we will be compelled to attach the treasury account of the states concerned,” the bench, also comprising expert member BS Sajwan, said. The matter has been fixed for further hearing on August 11. Earlier, the tribunal had directed the Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan governments to state how the field staff of the departments concerned and the state pollution control boards were going to control pollution caused by crop residue burning. The NGT had earlier fixed the environment penalty amounts per incident of crop burning to be paid by small land owners having less than two acres of land at Rs 2,500, medium land owners holding over two acres and less than five acres at Rs 5,000 and those owning over five acres at Rs 15,000. It had also directed the state governments to take coercive and punitive action against persistent defaulters and asked them to withdraw the assistance provided to such farmers. The green panel had said the five states--Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi- which had issued notifications prohibiting agriculture crop residue burning, should ensure that these notifications were enforced rigorously and proper action was taken against the defaulters. The NGT’s order had come on a plea by environmentalist Vikrant Tongad who had sought a ban on burning of agricultural waste and remnants in open fields."
Opioid use higher among cancer survivors,"Toronto

Opioid prescription use is more common in cancer survivors than in individuals without a history of the disease, a study led by an Indian origin scientist has found.

Researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada found that the rate of opioid prescribing was 1.22 times higher among cancer survivors than corresponding matched controls.

""Our research findings raise concerns about the diagnosis and management of chronic pain problems among survivors stemming from their cancer diagnosis or treatment,"" said Rinku Sutradhar, associate professor at University of Toronto.

Over a 36-month period, the average number of opioid prescriptions filled by survivors was 7.7, compared with 6.3 for controls.

This increased rate of opioid prescribing was also seen among survivors who were 10 or more years past their cancer diagnosis, researchers said.

Individuals with lower income, and those who were younger, from rural neighbourhood's, and with more comorbidities had significantly higher prescribing rates. Sex was not associated with prescribing rates, they said.

""Physicians providing primary care to cancer survivors should consider close examination of reasons for continued opioid use to differentiate chronic pain from dependency,"" Sutradhar added.

The study was published in the journal Cancer. —PTI"
"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","Into its seventh season, TV series Game of Thrones remains as big and arresting as ever. Decoding its stupendous success, however, remains both a mystery and an enigma

When you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die. But the epic show remains a ceaseless winner. Into its seventh season, its grip is as firm, the frenzy as frenzied and viewership far from diminished. Why, the premier show even crashed the HBO website. Reams have been written on what makes it the most popular show around the world. Yet no one can truly decode the volatile combination that is as high on surprise as emotional connect. More recently, a study has been undertaken to deconstruct its stupendous success.

Chance viewing of the Game of Thrones episode is unlikely to hook you. Battery of actors, numerous spheres of action and multiple hydra-headed plots are instead likely to leave you befuddled. But if you are one of the millions glued to the show, the likes of which television has never seen before, you will be in a permanent jaw-dropping state.

To borrow an analogy from the Indian tradition, one can easily say it has all the navarasas. Though some would say more of the vibhats ras, indeed much of its content has disgust-evoking highs or lows, if you prefer. Incest, rape, violence, bestiality, nudity... in the fantasy world of Westeros, there is much that is off putting. Some of its episodes: Stannis Baratheon agreeing to burn his only child on stake, Sansa Stark’s gruesome rape at the hands of her despotic husband Ramsay Bolton, are all brutal reminders that nothing is fair in the war for seven kingdoms. Many of these blood-curdling moments have not only led to much heartburn and earned it flak but even veered some viewers away. But what keeps them coming back despite gore is the manner in which it unfolds surprises. You never ever know what the next episode of the show will come riding on.

Spoilers invariably abound and soon after Season Five peaked with one of its most favourite protagonists Jon Snow’s death, news of his possible resurrection leaked as Kit Harington playing Snow was spotted shooting in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Indeed the magic in the series is for real. Yet even more magical are its enigmatic characters you dare fall in love at your own peril. For you don’t know when the writer has planned their demise. Based on George R.R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones, the first novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, what was conceived as a trilogy has now stretched into seven volumes and eight seasons.

Considered un-filmable once, now the reins rest with David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss. The buzz goes around that when both call an actor of the series, it signals their imminent end. So strong is the bond with the characters that even actors mourn the demise of their reel character. More recently, Jessica Henwick, who plays Nymeria Sand, felt a great sense of loss and grief. One of its most enduring and endearing characters, Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, says he has to know whether his character has survived the season for him to truly map it. An imp, he has the serial’s most intelligent lines such as, “Never forget who you are for the world won’t, wear it like an armour and no one will hurt you.”

Most fantasy series are targeted at children, and perhaps the child in us. But Game of Thrones comes laced with not only adult-rated scenes, much of which is, of course, has been censored for the Indian audience, but also highbrow stuff. Sardonic humour, witty one-liners, wisecracks are as much its USP as the grand scale and magnitude achieved at a whopping cost of $10 million. Even Hollywood borrows its catchphrases. Baywatch turned around the tagline “Winter is coming” into “The summer is coming”.

But who can recreate the world far-removed from ours; what with ghost-walkers, fire-spewing dragons, wildlings, brave and ambitious lords, scheming men and sinister women. Yet, somehow, amid all that is alien, even abhorrent to our sensibilities, it manages to bat for women. Two of its most powerful protagonists are women. But if you think Game of Thrones is politically or socially correct, think again. It follows no rules. Grey is a colour Indians understand too well, and here men and women painted in broad brush strokes of black like Jamie Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) could suddenly warm their way to your heart.

The epic series, however, isn’t your heart-tugging drama. Each viewer might have its own favourites. Author Martin’s obviously is Tyrion, the imp, which explains why the dwarf stands tallest among them all. Spunky Arya Stark (Maise Williams) is supposedly his wife’s, a reason many believe she won’t be bumped off. But who will really survive, in the final countdown? Well, that question is what makes this game of the survival of the fittest, fiercest and cruellest, an addiction viewers just can’t get rid of."

NEW DELHI: There are about 18,000 bird species on Earth, and every species is differently coloured.

New Delhi

There are about 18,000 bird species on Earth, and every species is differently coloured.

While some birds are so bright in colour, one can spot them from afar, some are coloured so as to camouflage- you'll never realise if you're even looking at the bird! The feathers are composed of intricate combinations of mottles, scales, bars, and spots, making each one unique.

It has already been discovered that different patterns and colours help camouflage the birds from predators, but have you ever wondered how they get such different colours?

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Dr Ismael Galván and his team of expert researchers conducted a study on about 9,000 bird species' plumage coloration to answer the very question. Two types of pigments are responsible for the pumage coloration: melanins, which produce a range of black, grey, brown, and orange colors, and carotenoids, which are used by specialised feather structures to generate brighter color hues.

Carotenoids, present in certain food items, circulate through the bloodstream and to the feather follicles when birds consume such food items. The birds cannot produce carotenoids, nor can they exercise direct cellular control of synthesizing and depositing carotenoids. The specialized feather structures react to the consumed carotenoids with a mechanism that is not regulated by specialized cells.

Melanins, on the other hand, are synthesised by in the birds' bodies in special cells called ""melanocytes,"" which work together with feather follicles to achieve a fine control of pigmentation. Although carotenoids are more frequently researched in the study of bird coloration, Dr Galván and group are the first to test whether melanins are indeed the only pigmentary element that birds' bodies directly control on a cellular level.

Galván says, ""Knowing beforehand that different pigments and structures produce different types of colors in feathers, we examined the appearance of the plumage of all species of extant birds and determined if the color patches that they contain are produced by melanins or by other pigmentary elements. We also identified those plumage patterns that can be considered complex, defining them as those formed by combinations of two or more discernible colors that occur more than two times uninterruptedly through the plumage."" According to the researchers, 32% of the species studied have complex plumage patterns, with the vast majority of these complex patterns produced by melanins rather than carotenoids. In other words, carotenoids produce color patches, whereas melanins produce intricate patterns.

However, there are exceptions: Fruit doves, cotingas and one type of stork have complex plumage patterns without melanins. Their unusual colors appear to be produced by their bodies making metabolic modifications to the carotenoid pigments that they consume. —ANI"

HC strikes down height restrictions during ‘dahi handi’ celebrations,"Shiv Kumar

Tribune News Service

Mumbai, August 7



The Bombay High Court on Monday struck down its earlier order imposing a height restriction of 20 feet for pyramids built by revellers during ‘dahi handi’ celebrations.

Hearing the matter afresh on the orders of the Supreme Court, Justice Bhushan Gavai and Justice Makarand Karnik of the HC said matters pertaining to restricting the height of pyramids during ‘dahi handi’ celebrations were best left to the legislature. “If we enter into that arena we would be encroaching on the domain of the legislature,” the court said.

Earlier, the Maharashtra government submitted before the court that it would bar the participation of children below the age of 14 in the celebrations. Additional solicitor-general Tushar Mehta who represented the state government said the ban on participation of children below 14 would be as per provisions of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act.

The court was hearing two public interest litigations over the safety of participants or ‘Govindas’ who build pyramids to break a pot constructed at a height. In 2014, the HC had banned the participation of children below 18 in the pyramids. The height of the human pyramids was also restricted to 20 feet or four layers.

The HC, however, took into consideration the government’s assurances given to the Supreme Court that safety measures to reduce the risk of accidents to the participants would be strictly implemented."

After clinching a comprehensive victory against Sri Lanka in the Colombo Test which helped India attain the unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, Team India skipper Virat Kohli caught up with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) wrestler The Great Khali. The Indian skipper expressed his joy on his Twitter handle and said, “It was great to meet The Great Khali, what a guy!” The ‘Men in Blue’ thumped the struggling Sri Lankan team once again in the ongoing three-Test series, wrapping up the victory in the second Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) by an innings and 53 runs. After kissing glory on Friendship Day, the 28-year-old met ‘The Great Khali’, aka Dalip Singh Rana. The two teams will now play the final Test beginning August 12 before starting off with the five-match ODI series and a lone T20. And considering the quality, or the lack of it, of the Sri Lankan team, the visitors will look to complete a clean sweep in Pallekele (Kandy), where the third Test will be played. ANI"

"The Tribune: Jalandhar City, Jalandhar Cantt news","JALANDHAR: The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has made many residents of the city upset as the rates of many traditional Indian “mithais” and chocolates have gone up.

Jalandhar, August 6

The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has made many residents of the city upset as the rates of many traditional Indian “mithais” and chocolates have gone up. The delicious sweets and chocolates as well as chocolate-made “mithais” are reported to be consumed less during the Rakhi festival. There is a 5 per cent tax applicable on plain “rasmalai”, but one has to pay 18 per cent tax on buying “kesar rasmalai”. Moreover, the plain “barfi”, which cost between Rs 250 and Rs 300 earlier, is taxed at 5 per cent and now costs between Rs 300 and Rs 350. Customer at a “mithai” shop said, “Kaju or pista barfi attracts 18 per cent tax as shopkeepers are fixing the GST according to the rate of dry fruit and ingredients used. Some are even charging 20 per cent GST for silver-coated mithai.”

The traditional sweets, as informed by shopkeepers, are attracting a 5 per cent GST, while chocolates are being taxed at the rate of 28 per cent. Although the government had recently clarified that the rate of tax on chocolate-made “mithai” will be the same as “mithai”, the complexity over the new tax regime still prevails in the market. Even the government also stated that the GST will be levied on the main product and not on ingredients. Still, bewildered shopkeepers are charging tax at different rates on the same product.

Inderjit Singh, a customer at a local sweet shop, said, “Earlier, “mithai” was tax-free, but now it attracts 5 per cent tax. The sweets and “mithais” which are enjoyed by every class should not be taxed. Giving sweets to each other on happy occasions and on festivals is a tradition which has been observed in India for decades. With the imposition of the 5 per cent tax, the government has only spoiled our festive mood.”

In fact, the same response was received from many other residents who said, “This time it’s better to gift relatives biscuits and cakes as even shopkeepers are not clear about the new tax on the chocolate-made “mithai”, so they are charging 28 per cent GST on chocolate burfi or and special chocolate rolls.”

Even tax is being levied on snacks like “samosa”, which was available at Rs 10. It now costs Rs 12. We do not understand what the government would achieve by taxing eatables,” he added."

With the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, Modi dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied

[ + read story ]

Modi! Modi! Modi! Rarely is an Indian Prime Minister accorded such a rapturous reception by audiences wherever he speaks, whether at the numerous political rallies or gatherings at Madison Square Garden in New York or the Allphones Arena in Sydney. Seldom does a single individual make such an impact that an entire year is defined by what he says, does or wants, as Narendra Modi did in 2014.

So if The Tribune has declared 2014 as the Year of Modi, it is not because of his oratorical skills (his opponents, in fact, accuse him of spending most of his time speechifying). Or for the rock-star persona that he has acquired in the past year. It is because Modi, with the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied. In doing so, he achieved Mission Impossible: Winning a clear majority for the BJP in the General Election and forming the first government in 25 years that doesn’t have to depend on coalition partners.

In a country as vast and vibrant as India, it may not be wise to take a monochromatic view of developments that shaped us in 2014. There was terror constantly lurking, both within and without, that dominated the discourse. In the past month, we were witness to three such dastardly acts: In Uri, suicide bombers stormed into an Army camp and mowed down 11 soldiers and policemen; in Peshawar, AK-47 toting Islamic militants barged into an Army School and let loose a murderous fusillade that killed 150 persons, mostly students; Sydney saw a lone wolf hold hostage customers at a café, killing two of them before being gunned down by the security forces. In Syria and Iraq, a new form of Islamic extremism took root with brutal consequences.

The year saw crime and culpability apart from shame and scandal. The nation was shocked and rocked again when in Delhi a young working woman was raped by a taxi driver whom she had hired to take her home at night. In the region, self-styled godmen made news for the wrong reasons. In Haryana, one of them defied court orders for his arrest, forcing the police to engage in a pitched battle with his supporters to nab him. Another, who was charged with castrating some of his followers, unabashedly acted in a film that portrayed him in a divine light. The followers of a guru in Punjab refused to cremate his body after his death claiming that he would soon ‘return’ from his astral journey.

The year had many bright spots too. Indian space scientists took a stellar leap when a craft they built and launched successfully orbited Mars, earning them the distinction of being the first to get it right the first time. In Jammu and Kashmir, voters preferred the ballot over the bullet by turning out in record numbers in the recent Assembly elections. Germany defeated Argentina 1-0 to lift the football World Cup. And Rohit Sharma smashed 264 runs in an ODI to notch up a record.

If there were cheers, there were tears too, in plenty. Srinagar was inundated with unprecedented floods that turned the tourist paradise into a watery hell. In Himachal, 24 engineering students from Hyderabad, on an educational tour, were drowned when the water levels rose while they were frolicking in the Beas. A fire aboard the submarine INS Sindhuratna resulted in the death of two Navy personnel and triggered the resignation of Admiral DK Joshi — the first such on moral grounds. Internationally, the tragic shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines flight by Ukrainian rebels saw 298 passengers perish.

Yet, for India, 2014 truly belonged to Modi, who chalked out a masterly election campaign, complete with 3-D effects, to wow audiences across the country with his development mantra. Fed up of the indecisive and effete Congress-led UPA II, voters put their faith in Modi to bring about a decisive government that would deliver on its promises. Modi began well by inviting the region’s leaders, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister, for his swearing-in ceremony and then announced a slew of programmes, including ‘Make in India’ and ‘Swachh Bharat’ that fired the imagination of the public and sent stock markets soaring. Luck helped too with world petroleum prices dropping, pushing down inflation in India to near zero and shoring up the flagging economy.

The Opposition though felt that Modi was just a showman with little to show and mocked that the “achche din” he promised had yet to materialise. It didn’t help Modi one bit when the saffron brigade shifted the focus to issues such as conversion and love jihad. Yet, by the year-end, Modi seemed to be on an extended honeymoon with voters in Haryana, Maharashtra and now Jharkhand endorsing his brand of politics. It put the BJP in the driver’s seat in these states, unlike in J&K where the party made impressive gains but fell far short of a majority. In 2014, the Modi juggernaut seemed unstoppable. The New Year beckons!"

Gitanjali Sharma

The Tricolour. That’s the first sight that awaits a visitor stepping out of the Srinagar airport. Riding high on a tall mast on the airport lawns, it somewhat dwarfs the images of the green and black flags raised at pro-freedom protests. It’s a rather comforting thought, despite the promise to keep behind all preconceptions on this four-day journey to experience the Valley in its various shades.

Day 1 (Friday), Dateline: Srinagar

Minutes later, moving towards the city, the taxi driver, a local, expectedly veered the conversation around violence, the innumerable restrictions and outsiders’ apprehensions — real and imaginary. The traffic was bare minimum, courtesy the Friday factor. Zipping along the Jhelum, the driver finally applied brakes to his chatter at the hotel resting near the river, with the trailing thought: peace through dialogue remains the destination of most Kashmiris. The wait is on.

The shades of this wait were only too visible at the Dal Lake, its placidness donning a sombre shroud with few appreciators in sight. Asif Khan, one of the many shikarawallahs wistfully awaiting customers, blamed the blankness around to the recent attack on Amarnath pilgrims. When probed a little further, he vent out his anger on the government that was “doing nothing to resolve the Kashmir issue”. The wait for tourists, aman and azadi continues, he said, creating ripples in the still waters.

Postscript: Just five occupants at the hotel. A tip brought in three lovely roses from its lush garden to the room.

Day 2, Dateline: Central Kashmir

The ubiquitous wait wears a uniformed look for the soldiers tackling militants, both local and Pakistan nationals.

The run from Srinagar to Zojila passes through the heavily fortified central Kashmir towns of Ganderbal and Sonmarg. As the Amarnath yatris take this route to the Baltal camp, armed soldiers, alert to untowardness of any kind, can be seen stationed a few metres apart. Keeping endless vigil, they too appear to be players, howsoever different, in the waiting game.

“The security forces can keep the situation under control up to a certain level but beyond that the political set-up has to take over,” a top Army officer in the region summed up the lingering Kashmir crisis.

Despite the threat to even the seasonal multicultural plurality, the yatris’ enthusiasm has shown no dip. The fervour was evident too at the Pahalgam base camp in south Kashmir, which was toured the next day. The separatists may keep making loud proclamations about “Kashmiri hospitality” for “our yatri guests” but equally loud remain their frequent calls for shutdowns and “freedom”.

Postscript: Got little time to sit and stare on the Sonmarg meadows that are being overwhelmed by the surrounding construction activity.

Day 3, Dateline: South Kashmir

“I am confused. I want peace but I don’t know how it will come about. I have no faith in any of the mainstream parties. Yes, I am drawn towards the new militants surfacing on the social media. At least, they promise freedom…I live on that hope.” This outburst of a dryfruit-seller in Pampore reflects the angst of many Kashmiris and their disillusionment with political leaders. The outrage against the PDP, particularly for aligning with the rightist BJP, in its south Kashmir bastion is all too palpable.

PDP vice-president and Chief Minister’s Mehbooba Mufti’s uncle Sartaj Madni, who is one of the prime movers in the government, admitted some people were upset with their party but expressed confidence that they would come around. Hopeful of a dialogue, he placed implicit faith in the Central Government for resolving the Kashmir issue. The wait for the Modi government to take the initiative to understand and settle the Kashmir crisis hasn’t died, though some of the optimism has surely waned in the last three years.

In contrast, Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh has ruled out the possibility of a dialogue during the present situation. “The time is not conducive for talks,” he put it categorically, alluding to the unending violence.

This stance, however, doesn’t go down well with the majority in Kashmir who have been long waiting for a discourse. Prof Noor Ahmad Baba, a political expert, is of the view that Kashmir has gone restive waiting for the Central Government to at least acknowledge the problem as it exists. The signs of violence and terror in south Kashmir, the hub of militancy, are starkly visible along the Pampore-Pahalgam stretch. Just metres away from the highway at Pampore in Pulwama district stand the burnt and damaged Entrepreneurship Development Institute buildings that came under fidayeen attack twice over. A little ahead in Anantnag, comes the point where the pilgrim bus came under militant fire.

Crossing the vulnerable highway in south Kashmir, a thought creeps along: will the wait for peace remain just that. A wait. The disheartening thought, however, evaporates the minute you meet Amarnath yatra pilgrims at Pahalgam, the longer but less excruciating route to the shrine. Their enthusiasm and that of the hospitable locals around, allows faith to make way for hope again… hope for some resolution to this conflict.

The SSP at Anantnag, Altaf Khan, a counter-insurgency specialist, appeared confident about the militant count dipping significantly over the next six months. However, gullible youth turning to flashy new-age militants occupying the social media still remained a concern, he admitted while regretting the disappearance of the multi-cultural society from Kashmir. “I had 85 per cent Pandits in my class in Srinagar. The new generation hasn’t seen this plurality. Having grown up seeing only violence and mistrust, they know little of Kashmiriyat,” he asserts.

The Centre’s indecisiveness to boldly tackle the crisis, too, draws flak from some quarters. Another top cop from the region declared that the Modi government must take a decision, even if it is to bring the state fully under its control.

Postscript: The nun chai (salty tea) and flattened buns at a roadside bakery both freshened the mind and spirit.

Day 4, Dateline: North Kashmir

It was an exhilarating four-hour stretch from Srinagar to Aman Setu, the peace bridge connecting Uri with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Passing through Baramulla, the Jhelum snaked along one side and apple orchards dotted the green cover on the other.

At Aman Setu, the peace bus arrived with passengers, some returning to this side and others visiting from across the LoC. One thing they all had in common: a satiated look that comes with fulfilment of some kind. Grateful for this exchange, they gushed over the need for peace.

This wait continues, more so for the real stakeholders on the sidelines — the student who wants to attend school without fear, the soldier who hasn’t got leave to be home with his family, and the shikarawallah who wants to wind up the day with at least Rs 500 in his pocket.

Minutes after the arrival of the peace bus came the flash about shelling near Aman Setu. News from the Rajouri area had already come earlier in the day of a soldier and a six-year-old girl succumbing to heavy Pakistan shelling.

Heading back through a vulnerable area, the mind was blank, there was no room for fear or anxiety. All that it carried with it was the burden of the lives gone and the lives still struggling as the conflict and the wait lives on.

Postscript: On the return flight, a Kashmiri Pandit was sceptical about resolving the Kashmir crisis through dialogue. Minutes later, however, she said resignedly: “Probably, that’s the only way out.”"
Senate confirms 3 Indian-Americans to key US govt positions,"Washington, August 4

The Senate has unanimously confirmed three Indian-Americans to key government positions, including one as the Trump administration’s czar on intellectual property--an area of sharp differences between the US and India. The Senate confirmed Neil Chatterjee as a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Vishal Amin as Intellectual Property (IP) Enforcement Coordinator in the Trump administration. Krishna Urs was confirmed as the US ambassador to Peru. A career foreign service officer since 1986, Urs--after Nikki Haley--is the second Indian-American to have been selected for an ambassadorial position by the administration.

Haley, a two-term former governor of South Carolina, is the US ambassador to the United Nations and holds a cabinet-level position in the administration. She is the first Indian-American to do so in any US presidential administration. As the new IP Czar, Amin would be responsible for enforcement of intellectual property, an area of sharp differences between India and the United States. The US on Friday retained India on its priority watch list this year for “lack of improvement” in the intellectual property (IP) framework. In April, the US retained India on its priority watch list for “lack of improvement” in the IP framework. However, India had termed the report as a unilateral move by the US. Amin is currently the senior counsel on the House Judiciary Committee. “Vishal Amin has been a valued member of my staff and will continue to be a tireless advocate on behalf of America’s innovators and creators,” said Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He has previously served in the administration of President George W Bush as associate director for Domestic Policy, and at the Department of Commerce as special assistant and associate director for policy in the Office of the Secretary, the White House said. Chatterjee, currently the energy policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, over the years has played an integral role in the passage of major energy, highway, and farm legislations. “Chatterjee has an extensive knowledge of the many important federal issues facing our industry and customers,” said Edison Electric Institute (EEI) President Tom Kuhn. Prior to serving McConnell, he worked as a principal in Government Relations for National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. Urs is currently charge d’affaires of the US Embassy in Madrid, Spain, where he was also the deputy chief of mission. Urs has specialised in economic issues and developed extensive policy experience in the Andean region of South America. He has served at seven United States embassies as well in senior leadership positions in Washington DC."

Panchkula, August 6

After Chandigarh Tribune highlighted the plight of students of Morni villages ( read the story ), who have to cross the swollen Ghaggar during the rains as their is no connecting road or bridge, the Panchkula district administration today swung into action. Deputy Commissioner Gauri Parashar Joshi wrote to the Western Command, Chandimandir, seeking the Army’s help in the construction of temporary bridges over the Ghaggar at five locations. After the Deputy Commissioner’s letter, a joint team of the Panchkula administration and the Western Command, including ADC Rajesh Jogpal, today visited the Bhojkoti area in Morni and it was decided to construct a foot overbridge there so that students, villagers and even two-wheelers can easily cross the Ghaggar. Army officials took the measurement of the area and it was decided that if the project worked successfully, it would be replicated at other dangerous spots as well. Earlier today, the Deputy Commissioner wrote to the Administration Commandant, Western Command, Chandigarh, saying, “The situation warrants immediate redressal. A number of hamlets and some villages in Morni have no access to road and villagers, including school students, have to cross the river bed to reach their destinations. The Ghaggar is prone to flash floods and at present, the level of the river is 3 to 4 ft. There is a warning of heavy rain in Himachal Pradesh, which will further increase the water level of the Ghaggar. To avert any untoward incident and loss of life, the district administration requests for help -- both in resources and technical expertise -- urgently”.

Villagers appreciate move

Sanjay Singh, a resident of Morni, appreciated the move of the Panchkula administration. He said they were now hopeful that the Army would soon construct foot overbridges, which would ultimately help the villagers, especially children and the elderly. Students lost lives in the past Villagers said a few years ago, three students of schools in Bijlag and Raji Tikri villages lost their lives on the way to their schools as they drowned while crossing a swollen rivulet."
I have power of people behind me: Stalking victim,"Chandigarh/New Delhi, August 7

“I have the power of the people behind me,” the young woman who was allegedly stalked by Haryana BJP chief's son and his friend said on Monday as politicians, bureaucrats and women rallied around her.

Three days after the 29-year-old was chased through the streets of Chandigarh on her way home late on Friday night, the high-profile incident involving the daughter of a bureaucrat and the son of a politician led to a political slugfest and put the issue of stalking in the crosshairs of national attention.

While Haryana's opposition Congress accused the Centre and the BJP of ""conspiring to hush up"" the case against the son of Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy said he would file a PIL in the Punjab and Haryana High Court for a court-monitored CBI probe.

Vikas Barala (23), and his friend, Ashish Kumar (27) were earlier arrested for allegedly stalking the woman and later released on bail as they had been booked under bailable sections of the IPC and the Motor Vehicles Act.

As the controversy swirled, highlighting the vulnerability of women even in public spaces, the woman at the centre of it all said she was grateful for all the support.

""… I have the power of people behind me, never before in my life have I felt so much support,"" said the DJ by profession.

Had she not been the daughter of an IAS officer, things could have ended differently.

""If I had been a village girl, probably I would not have the resources to fight these guys,"" said the complainant who appeared on television with her father by her side to present her viewpoint.

""If we don't do it (pursue the case), then who will.""

Her father said ""unless somebody from the family (of the accused) was trying to sabotage the investigations, we are very clear. We do not hold the family responsible in any way"".

BJP MP Kirron Kher, who represents Chandigarh in the Lok Sabha, assured the young woman and her family that justice would be done.

The Chandigarh police, she said, was not facing any political pressure and dismissed as ""wild allegations"" some reports that the CCTV footage had gone missing.

""As a mother, I can understand the sentiments of the victim's family at this time. Whatever is legal and correct in this case, will be done.""

Kher also referred to her party colleague Chandigarh BJP vice-president Ramveer Bhatti's reported comments that girls and women should not go out alone at midnight.

""I think this is a very unfortunate statement, which reflects the mindset of many men in this country. I think that Bhatti should have exercised restraint,"" Kher said.

However, Bhatti clarified his remarks later and said, ""What I meant to convey is that it is the responsibility of parents to watch over their children and their activities.""

He described the stalking incident as ""unfortunate and shameful"".

The National Commission for Women has sought a free and fair probe in the ‘stalking’ case.

The commission has also asked for regular updates in the case, NCW chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam told PTI.

""In the letter (to police) we have asked them to conduct a quick, immediate, fair and free investigation in the case and let us know what is happening in every stage,"" she said.

The comments by the commission head came amid allegations by the Congress that the central government and the state BJP were conspiring to hush up the case. — PTI"

Bathinda, August 6

After getting a rap on its knuckles from the Local Bodies Department, the Municipal Corporation Bathinda (MCB) has drastically reduced the price at which it would buy tree guards as part of its plantation drive.

While earlier, it had proposed to buy tree guards at Rs 2,250 each, now the rate has been brought down to Rs 1,280.

In May, the cash-strapped Municipal Corporation Bathinda had planned to spend Rs 1.09 crore to buy 5,000 tree guards for the city.

Apart from this, the MCB had also planned to spend Rs 35.5 lakh on fixing and installing these tree guards.

Interestingly, the MCB had installed around 4,000 tree guards last year as well but no one knew where these were installed.

In July, the Local Bodies Department rejected the proposal of the MCB to buy 5,000 tree guards.

The state government also asked the MCB to explain about the status of the tree guards bought last year.

The department directed the MCB to present the tree guard proposal again in the general house meeting.

The Horticulture Branch of the MCB tabled a renewed proposal during the Finance and Contract Committee (F&CC) meeting held on August 2.

In the proposal not only the number of tree guards to be purchased was brought down, the rate at which these were to be bought was also cut.

The branch submitted a report, which stated that it had called for tenders to purchase 1,500 tree guards.

Of the five tenders, which the horticulture branch received, the tender was allotted to Garg Industries, which quoted the lowest price of Rs 18.68 lakh.

The horticulture branch mentioned that the rate at which the tender was granted was considerably low than the last time.

The proposal clarified that due to amendments in the rate of steel, this time the tender had been granted at Rs 18.68 lakh as against Rs 33.75 lakh quoted last time."
"How Centre, state failed farmers on insurance","THE TRIBUNE SPECIAL

One-size-fits-all scheme ill-suited to state; individual’s crop loss not taken into account; hefty premiums a concern for the govt as well as farmers

Amarjit Thind

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 6

Crop loss for any reason is a setback farmers of Punjab – most of whom are small – can hardly sustain. Yet, there are no takers in the state for the crop insurance scheme offered by the Central Government. The state has some very valid reasons for that, all simple economics. At a larger level, it is the ‘one size fits all’ approach of successive governments that may be to blame. As the arrangements stand today, what a farmer in Punjab gets is “compensation” for the damage. But this mostly remains meaningless, as often the relief is Rs 5,000, or even smaller amounts, paid by the state government for losses of up to Rs 40,000-50,000 per acre. The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) was touted as a radical solution for its beneficiaries by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Ground realities, however, reveal that it has turned out to be another money-spinner dished out by insurance companies, facilitated by the government. Farmers of Punjab say they had no say in the formulation of the policy so crucial to them.

THE PUNJAB EXPERIENCE

Thus far, Punjab, Sikkim, Manipur and Nagaland have not implemented the PMFBY, while it is operational or will be soon in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Odisha, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam. Old-timers like Bishan Singh and Bachan Singh of Khaira Dona village in Kapurthala district recall that farmers have been the losers in all farm insurance schemes implemented by the Centre since the Individual Approach Basis Scheme was launched in 1972. They have memories of the ‘great flood’ of 1962 and the pittance received as compensation. A few rupees, some blankets, but no “insurance”. Officially, nearly 20 per cent of the cropped area was damaged in floods that year as compared to 13 per cent and 10 per cent in 2009 (15 dead) and 1988 (200 dead), respectively. In well-irrigated Punjab, those were the heady days of the Green Revolution (paddy was recording an increase of 5.30 per cent per annum), whereas most of the insurance schemes were tailor-made for rain-fed agriculture of many other states. The Comprehensive Crop Insurance Scheme (CCIS- 1985) focused largely on drought, whereas the state’s farmers wanted only insurance for hailstorm but with higher indemnity. Successive governments – both the SAD and the Congress – over the decades only paid lip service on this count. Policies were framed, scrapped and re-framed, but turned out to be just old wine in fancy new bottles each time, says BS Rajewal of the BKU.

WHY PMFBY DOESN’T WORK

In its present avatar, the major flaw in the farm insurance scheme is that it comes into play only if there is 40 per cent crop damage in a village, which is counted as a single unit for availing any relief, says Rajewal. First, farmers want that instead of being village-specific, the scheme should be farm plot-specific, with crop indemnity (compensation) levels above 95 per cent. Secondly, farmers demand that the 10-year benchmark for assessing ‘normal’ yield levels while deciding on the insurance premium should be scrapped, and the latest yield should be taken into account. The premium should also be standardised to 1 per cent for all crops, as crop losses in Punjab are very low as compared to the rest of the country. Thirdly, the crop lying in market yards should also be covered. At present, only the harvested crop in the fields lies within the ambit of the scheme. Largely mechanised harvesting operations and relatively easy access to markets in Punjab ensure that the crop reaches mandis within hours. Hence, it needs protection from the vagaries of weather in the mandi, where it may await procurement for days. In view of stiff opposition by the peasantry and farmer unions, the scheme has been given a quiet burial by the state government. In a meeting on this issue with senior officials of the Union Agriculture Ministry and the insurance companies a couple of years ago, Rajewal says he asked if the rationale of the entire village being a single unit was applied to vehicles or life insurance. Would the company only settle claims if 40 people died or 40 vehicles were involved in a pile-up? Needless to say, that was the end of it, he added. Haryana implemented the scheme and its farmers have alleged that the insurance companies collected over Rs 750 crore in premium, but only disbursed Rs 112 crore as compensation. The matter was even raised in Parliament, Rajewal claims.

KEEP ARHTIYA OUT

Buta Singh Burj Gill, president of the BKU (Dakaunda), too minces no words in denouncing the scheme in its present form as anti-farmer and pro-corporate. We desperately need insurance but not at these costs and terms, he added. There are no takers for even premiums heavily subsidised by the Centre and the states (in equal proportion). Farmers pay 2 per cent of the premium for kharif crops, 1.5 per cent for rabi and 5 per cent for horticulture crops. On an average, a farmer has to pay Rs 800 per acre for rabi and kharif crops and Rs 1,250 per acre for cotton as premium. They are not able to bear that cost. The need is to scrap the arhtiya system. The money/profits collected by this system under the present procurement arrangement can be used to pay the PMFBY premium, saving both farmers and the government this recurring fiscal burden once and for all, Gill suggests. The Mandi Board is equipped to buy the produce from the farmers, and everyone would be more than willing to clean the crop, weigh it and transport it to the nearest state godown. This would not only provide employment to the landless labourers, but also mean an additional income for the farmers on freight charges, he pointed out. As it is, farmers transport the produce to the mandis. When the government knows that the farmers are fiscally distressed and committing suicides, why burden them with another life-long liability, asks Gill.

UNRESPONSIVE STATE GOVTS

Solution in guaranteed income; production, market risk both coverED

Punjab’s reluctance to implement the PMFBY also drew the attention of Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, who told the Rajya Sabha recently that the state should seriously consider implementing the scheme as it had neither sent a draft for drought relief nor done crop insurance in the past five years. “I have seen the record of the state; Punjab’s farmers do not go in for crop insurance. But during drought, even a request for relief was not made to us,” he added. Under the PMFBY, there would be no upper limit on the subsidy provided by the Centre or the state. “Even if the balance premium (after farmers’ contribution) is 90 per cent, it will be borne by the government,” according to an official. In previous schemes, the premium had been capped, which resulted in low claims being paid to farmers. This was done to limit the government outgo on the premium subsidy. “This has been removed. Farmers will get the claim against the full sum insured without any deductions,” the official says. Another benefit of the PMFBY is that losses incurred from the sowing stage to the post-harvest season would all be covered. Earlier, only post-harvest losses could be offset. Farmers who haven’t availed bank loans would also be eligible for insurance cover.While farmer unions have been agitating for implementing the MS Swaminathan Commission recommendations and bureaucrats are clueless on what to do, a report by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, in 2014 suggested that a study of all insurance schemes since 1974 till date had revealed that opting for the Farm Income Insurance Scheme (FIIS-2003-04) would be the best bet for Punjab. As this is the sole scheme covering both production and market risk, it could also be used for giving a boost to the flagging diversification drive of the state, the PAU study observed. It envisages targeting two critical components that decides a farmer’s income — yield and price — through a single policy instrument by ensuring a “minimum guaranteed income” determined by using the average yield for the previous seven years and the MSP. If the actual income falls short of the guaranteed sum, the farmer would be eligible for compensation to the extent of indemnity from the Agricultural Insurance Company (AIC) of India."
Gatlin crashes Bolt’s farewell party,"35-year-old wins 100m title in 9.92s but American is booed by crowd; Bolt third in final individual event

London, August 6

Justin Gatlin ruined Usain Bolt’s farewell party when the 35-year-old American won the world 100 metres title on Saturday, beating the Jamaican superstar into third and sparking a chorus of boos from a London crowd unhappy with his doping past. What was meant to be a glorious celebration of the departure of the sport’s greatest showman turned into a condemnation of its biggest pantomime villain as Gatlin, twice banned for drug offences, rolled back the years to win a second world title 12 years after his first and 13 after claiming Olympics 100m gold. As so often before Bolt made a terrible start but for once could not make it up as Christian Coleman, the 21-year-old American who beat him in the semifinals, looked set for victory. But Gatlin, who stumbled at the death to lose the 2015 world final to Bolt by a hundredth of a second, on this occasion timed his surge and dip to perfection to win in 9.92 seconds. Coleman, who has run over 40 races this year but turned professional only a few weeks ago, took silver in 9.94. Bolt, straining every sinew, fought all the way to the line but the pace and grace that took him to his world record of 9.58 eight years ago has withered with age and perennial injury battles and this time he ran out of track. “It’s just one of those things,” Bolt said. “My start is killing me. Normally, it gets better during the rounds but it didn’t come together.” When the results flashed up on the giant screen the crowd immediately began repeating the booing with which Gatlin’s name had been greeted since the heats on Friday. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his first response was to put his finger to his lips to indicate silence. The crowd reacted by chanting Bolt’s name and the Jamaican hugged Gatlin and told him he did not deserve the disrespect. “I tuned it out (the boos) through the rounds and stayed the course. I did what I had to do,” said Gatlin, who served a four-year ban from 2006 for a second doping offence — which he always denied. “The people who love me are here cheering for me and cheering at home.” “It is Bolt’s last race and he’s the man so it’s not about beating him. I have had many victories and many defeats down the years, he’s pushed and inspired me to be the athlete I am today. It’s surreal really to come across the line first — it’s still his night. We are rivals on the track but in the warm-down area we joke and have a good time. The first thing he did was congratulate me and say that I didn’t deserve the boos. He is an inspiration.”

First bronze

Nirmala qualifies for semis in 400m

As always, the ever-popular Bolt gave generously of his time after the race to fans and media alike, despite the unfamiliarity of finishing third for the first time in a major championship. The Jamaican had been seeking a fourth 100m world title to go with his four over 200m, four relay golds and eight Olympics crowns and a capacity 56,000 crowd had turned out fully expecting to celebrate it. “I needed to be in a better place after 30 metres but I just wasn’t in that super-shape I needed to be in,” said Bolt, who turns 31 this month. “I gave it my best shot but my body’s telling me it’s time to go.” He still has another chance to add to the medal tally in the 4x100m relay next week — when he will be desperate to avenge Saturday’s defeat in what, if the Americans manage to get the baton round, should be a last-leg showdown with Gatlin. — Reuterslondon: Nirmala Sheoran’s semifinals qualification in the women’s 400m was the saving grace on another disappointing day for India. In the men’s marathon, T Gopi finished 28th. Siddhanth Thingalaya crashed out of the 110m hurdles, finishing seventh in the heats. Nirmala, 22, clocked 52.01 seconds to finish fourth in her heat in the first round. She took the last spot among the six best finishers. The Haryana athlete, whose personal best is 51.20s, will have to drastically improve her performance in the semifinals tomorrow if she wants to qualify for the final. In women’s heptathlon, Swapna Barman was lying at 27th among 28 contestants with just one event to go.World-leader Kyron McMaster of the British Virgin Islands was disqualified in the men’s 400 metres hurdles heats on Sunday. McMaster, 20, was one of the favourites for the event, but reacted too quickly out of the blocks in the second heat and was disqualified for a false start. European champion Yasmani Copello showed why he is the Diamond League leader by setting the fastest time.Kenya’s Geoffrey Kipkorir Kirui prevailed in a compelling east African duel with Ethiopian Tamirat Tola on the streets of London to win the men’s marathon. Kirui, victor at the Boston Marathon in April, finally broke Tola, the fastest man in the field, with five miles (8.05 km) of the 26.2-mile course left after they had gone head-to-head over the second half of the race. Kirui clocked 2 hours 8 minutes 27 seconds, finishing one minute and 22 seconds ahead of Tola. Fast-finishing Alphonce Simbu won Tanzania’s second medal ever at a championships with the bronze.Rose Chelimo, a Bahraini who switched allegiance from her Kenyan homeland, sprinted away from her former compatriot Edna Kiplagat to win the women’s marathon after a tactical battle and an exciting finish. Chelimo fought back over the last few hundred metres after Kiplagat, two-time champion, struck for home too soon with two kilometres left. Chelimo clocked 2:27:11, seven seconds clear of Kiplagat. USA’s Amy Cragg closed in on Kiplagat but had to settle for the bronze in the same time of 2:27:18."

Game of addiction,"Into its seventh season, TV series Game of Thrones remains as big and arresting as ever. Decoding its stupendous success, however, remains both a mystery and an enigma

Nonika Singh

When you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die. But the epic show remains a ceaseless winner. Into its seventh season, its grip is as firm, the frenzy as frenzied and viewership far from diminished. Why, the premier show even crashed the HBO website. Reams have been written on what makes it the most popular show around the world. Yet no one can truly decode the volatile combination that is as high on surprise as emotional connect. More recently, a study has been undertaken to deconstruct its stupendous success.

Chance viewing of the Game of Thrones episode is unlikely to hook you. Battery of actors, numerous spheres of action and multiple hydra-headed plots are instead likely to leave you befuddled. But if you are one of the millions glued to the show, the likes of which television has never seen before, you will be in a permanent jaw-dropping state.

To borrow an analogy from the Indian tradition, one can easily say it has all the navarasas. Though some would say more of the vibhats ras, indeed much of its content has disgust-evoking highs or lows, if you prefer. Incest, rape, violence, bestiality, nudity... in the fantasy world of Westeros, there is much that is off putting. Some of its episodes: Stannis Baratheon agreeing to burn his only child on stake, Sansa Stark’s gruesome rape at the hands of her despotic husband Ramsay Bolton, are all brutal reminders that nothing is fair in the war for seven kingdoms. Many of these blood-curdling moments have not only led to much heartburn and earned it flak but even veered some viewers away. But what keeps them coming back despite gore is the manner in which it unfolds surprises. You never ever know what the next episode of the show will come riding on.

Spoilers invariably abound and soon after Season Five peaked with one of its most favourite protagonists Jon Snow’s death, news of his possible resurrection leaked as Kit Harington playing Snow was spotted shooting in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Indeed the magic in the series is for real. Yet even more magical are its enigmatic characters you dare fall in love at your own peril. For you don’t know when the writer has planned their demise. Based on George R.R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones, the first novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, what was conceived as a trilogy has now stretched into seven volumes and eight seasons.

Considered un-filmable once, now the reins rest with David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss. The buzz goes around that when both call an actor of the series, it signals their imminent end. So strong is the bond with the characters that even actors mourn the demise of their reel character. More recently, Jessica Henwick, who plays Nymeria Sand, felt a great sense of loss and grief. One of its most enduring and endearing characters, Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, says he has to know whether his character has survived the season for him to truly map it. An imp, he has the serial’s most intelligent lines such as, “Never forget who you are for the world won’t, wear it like an armour and no one will hurt you.”

Most fantasy series are targeted at children, and perhaps the child in us. But Game of Thrones comes laced with not only adult-rated scenes, much of which is, of course, has been censored for the Indian audience, but also highbrow stuff. Sardonic humour, witty one-liners, wisecracks are as much its USP as the grand scale and magnitude achieved at a whopping cost of $10 million. Even Hollywood borrows its catchphrases. Baywatch turned around the tagline “Winter is coming” into “The summer is coming”.

But who can recreate the world far-removed from ours; what with ghost-walkers, fire-spewing dragons, wildlings, brave and ambitious lords, scheming men and sinister women. Yet, somehow, amid all that is alien, even abhorrent to our sensibilities, it manages to bat for women. Two of its most powerful protagonists are women. But if you think Game of Thrones is politically or socially correct, think again. It follows no rules. Grey is a colour Indians understand too well, and here men and women painted in broad brush strokes of black like Jamie Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) could suddenly warm their way to your heart.

The epic series, however, isn’t your heart-tugging drama. Each viewer might have its own favourites. Author Martin’s obviously is Tyrion, the imp, which explains why the dwarf stands tallest among them all. Spunky Arya Stark (Maise Williams) is supposedly his wife’s, a reason many believe she won’t be bumped off. But who will really survive, in the final countdown? Well, that question is what makes this game of the survival of the fittest, fiercest and cruellest, an addiction viewers just can’t get rid of."

There are about 18,000 bird species on Earth, and every species is differently coloured.

While some birds are so bright in colour, one can spot them from afar, some are coloured so as to camouflage- you'll never realise if you're even looking at the bird! The feathers are composed of intricate combinations of mottles, scales, bars, and spots, making each one unique.

It has already been discovered that different patterns and colours help camouflage the birds from predators, but have you ever wondered how they get such different colours?

Dr Ismael Galván and his team of expert researchers conducted a study on about 9,000 bird species' plumage coloration to answer the very question. Two types of pigments are responsible for the pumage coloration: melanins, which produce a range of black, grey, brown, and orange colors, and carotenoids, which are used by specialised feather structures to generate brighter color hues.

Carotenoids, present in certain food items, circulate through the bloodstream and to the feather follicles when birds consume such food items. The birds cannot produce carotenoids, nor can they exercise direct cellular control of synthesizing and depositing carotenoids. The specialized feather structures react to the consumed carotenoids with a mechanism that is not regulated by specialized cells.

Melanins, on the other hand, are synthesised by in the birds' bodies in special cells called ""melanocytes,"" which work together with feather follicles to achieve a fine control of pigmentation. Although carotenoids are more frequently researched in the study of bird coloration, Dr Galván and group are the first to test whether melanins are indeed the only pigmentary element that birds' bodies directly control on a cellular level.

Galván says, ""Knowing beforehand that different pigments and structures produce different types of colors in feathers, we examined the appearance of the plumage of all species of extant birds and determined if the color patches that they contain are produced by melanins or by other pigmentary elements. We also identified those plumage patterns that can be considered complex, defining them as those formed by combinations of two or more discernible colors that occur more than two times uninterruptedly through the plumage."" According to the researchers, 32% of the species studied have complex plumage patterns, with the vast majority of these complex patterns produced by melanins rather than carotenoids. In other words, carotenoids produce color patches, whereas melanins produce intricate patterns.

However, there are exceptions: Fruit doves, cotingas and one type of stork have complex plumage patterns without melanins. Their unusual colors appear to be produced by their bodies making metabolic modifications to the carotenoid pigments that they consume. —ANI"

Saini wants Barala to step down,"Tribune News Service

Kurukshetra, August 6

BJP MP from Kurukshetra Raj Kumar Saini said today that state party president Subhash Barala should quit on moral grounds in the wake of his son’s arrest in an alleged stalking case in Chandigarh. Saini told The Tribune the incident has brought a bad name to the party working for women empowerment at the Centre and in the states . “The involvement of Vikas Barala in a crime of drunk driving and stalking of a woman is a serious offence. If a leader cannot sensitise even his own family members on women safety, he should stay away from public life,” he said. Saini said the incident mocked ‘Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao’ drive of the BJP government. The MP said Barala should not wait for the party high command to take a decision in the case. The involvement of family members in such a crime was a matter of concern for all, Saini added.Members of the Mahila Congress on Sunday burnt an effigy of state BJP president Subhash Barala and demanded his resignation. The protesters were led by All-India Mahila Congress social media in charge Chitra Sarwara. Chitra said: “Barala must resign on moral grounds. A fair trial is not expected until Barala quits. The way case is being handled, it shows that there is political pressure. The accused should be kept in custody and let the law take its due course.” Barala should be removed from his post as he could influence the investigation with his power, she said. “We fail to understand that what kind of lessons BJP president Amit Shah has given to party leaders during his recent visit. We expect that Shah would take Barala’s resignation besides giving some lessons to Chief Minister,” she added.Local Congress workers led by state general secretary Chiranjeev Rao on Sunday burnt an effigy of state BJP chief Subhash Barala and demanded his resignation.

He said Barala has nothing to do with the incident. The guilty would be punished according to the law, if found guilty. Khattar, while addressing mediapersons here, said the Chandigarh Police was handling the case and the law would take its course. “Justice will be done in the case. If anyone is found guilty, it’s condemnable,” he added. “This is my official stand and there should be no questions on the matter,” he said.

Cigarette butts may be reused to build roads,"Melbourne

Scientists have discovered a novel use for discarded cigarette butts in building roads, an advance that could reduce heat in urban areas as well as tackle the problem of waste accumulation.

Trillions of cigarette butts are produced every year worldwide, with most discarded into the environment. They take ages to break down while their toxic chemical load is released into creeks, rivers and the ocean.

Researchers from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University) in Australia have demonstrated that asphalt mixed with cigarette butts can handle heavy traffic and also reduce thermal conductivity.

The team encapsulated cigarette butts with bitumen and paraffin wax to lock in the chemicals and prevent any leaching from the asphalt concrete.

The encapsulated cigarettes butts were then mixed with hot asphalt mix for making samples.

""These encapsulated cigarette butts developed will be a new construction material which can be used in different applications and lightweight composite products,"" said Abbas Mohajerani, from RMIT University.

""This research shows that you can create a new construction material while ridding the environment of a huge waste problem,"" Mohajerani added.

This means the product could not only solve a huge waste problem but would also be useful in reducing the urban heat island effect common in cities, researchers said.

An urban heat island (UHI) is an urban area or metropolitan area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas due to human activities.

About six trillion cigarettes are produced every year, leading to more than 1.2 million tonnes of cigarette butt waste. These figures are expected to increase by more than 50 per cent by 2025, mainly due to an increase in world population.

""Cigarette filters are designed to trap hundreds of toxic chemicals and the only ways to control these chemicals are either by effective encapsulation for the production of new lightweight aggregates or by the incorporation in fired clay bricks,"" Mohajerani said.

The study was published in the journal Building Materials. —PTI"

Sentinels of Singapore,"Among the elaborate funerary paraphernalia at the Bukit Brown cemetery are statues of Sikhs, standing guard at some Chinese graves

Vandana Aggarwal

In the heart of Singapore lies Bukit Brown, a cemetery home to more than one lakh Chinese graves. The area is overgrown, and at first glance, it looks like any old Chinese cemetery with its horseshoe-shaped graves, elaborate funerary paraphernalia and tomb guards. Look again, and you will notice that statues of Sikhs stand guard at some of the tombs! The Sikhs, like other Indian communities, had made their presence felt in Singapore quite early. However, it was after the Anglo-Sikh wars of the 19th century that the British sat up and took notice of the military capabilities and bravery of the Sikhs. The first Sikh police contingent arrived in Singapore in 1881. A British recruitment handbook referred to them as being “fairly incorruptible”, and “good policemen.” Many of them took up private employment after completing their tenure with the government. Impressed by their masculine personality and bravery, the prosperous Chinese businessmen started employing Sikhs at their houses and businesses. Soon, they became an important part of their lives thanks to their honesty, hard work and loyalty. They are locally referred to as ‘jagas’ (Malay for guards), a word that undoubtedly owes its origins to the Punjabi word ‘jaga’ or ‘staying awake’. Old timers in Singapore nostalgically remember the kind-hearted, burly Sikh guards sitting in front of banks and offices on their charpoys. The Sikhs built a formidable reputation of being reliable protectors of life and property. The Chinese, who strongly believed in an afterlife, at some point decided that it would be a good idea to have the Sikh guards protecting them after their deaths as well.

Guarding the dead

The Bukit Brown cemetery was established in 1922. So far nearly 30 pairs of Sikh guards have been discovered there. These range from around 3 feet to 5 feet 8 inches in height. These stand in pairs, erect, holding guns by their sides and very often carry a kirpan too. Every curl of their beard, fold of their turban and wrinkle in their shirt is carefully carved out giving them a realistic, life-like appearance. Some of the guards look older; they have a slight slouch, a visible paunch and gentleness in their eyes. Others have an imposing appearance, with piercing eyes and are smartly dressed with carefully tied turbans, ammunition belts and police boots. There is no evidence that these beautiful statues were made in Singapore. These were probably imported from China with the rest of the tomb decorations. It is a mystery how the carvers were able to carve the likeness of the guards. Either these were sent sketches to help them or they modelled them after the Sikh policemen who had already made their way to Shanghai and other parts of China as policemen. Traditional Chinese medicine physician Chew Geok Long’s tomb, with its accompanying Sikh guards, is well maintained and the guards are brightly painted. These guards are dressed in military uniforms, and apart from the gun, also have a majestic ceremonial sword at their waist. These sentinels of a lost world replace the Chinese door gods, who guarded the tombs and ward off evil spirits. A few guards have ‘foo dogs’ — mythical Chinese guard dogs — standing beside them showcasing an interesting amalgamation of Chinese and Indian cultures. The features of some are distinctly Chinese!

A page forgotten

Sadly Bukit Brown was largely forgotten for decades having been closed in 1973. Nature then took over the graves, enveloping anything and everything in its embrace. In 2012, the government of Singapore announced plans to redevelop Bukit Brown into a housing estate and build a road through it. That was when Singaporeans, once again, took notice of this cultural heritage. The ‘brownies’ is a group of dedicated volunteers, who have worked tirelessly to make more people aware of the rich heritage at Bukit Brown. Peter Pak has discovered and extensively photographed and recorded these guards for the past six years. In his blog, “Rojak Librarian,” he states, “these Sikh guards are representative of a unique period of time when Singapore was a colony of the invincible British Empire.” When news about the presence of these statues came to public notice, Ishvinder Singh (30), a third-generation Sikh in Singapore, was taken by surprise. As a practicing Sikh, Bukit Brown meant a lot to him as he was at that time grappling with a desire to know more about his roots. He, along with researcher Vithya Subramaniam, decided to work on a Sikh heritage trail app. Vithya focused on research and content and Singh on technology. The app was launched in 2015. His aim was twofold — to make the Sikh youth proud of being Sikhs and to raise an awareness of their shared immigrant heritage.

A heritage conserved

At least one pair of Sikh guards, along with the tomb, which they were guarding, has been removed to make way for the proposed road. It is, however, being preserved as an important part of Singapore’s heritage by the National Heritage Board. Many of these statues are not easy to find and are hidden in the dense undergrowth. Closer inspection has shown that not all guards are Sikhs as some do not have facial hair. They have been exposed to the elements for decades and due to a lack of maintenance, many of them have been knocked down at an angle or have trees enveloping them. Human and nature notwithstanding, these Sikh guards are not giving up the job that was assigned to them and continue to stand tall, reminding us of how our forefathers travelled to faraway places and made a name and place for themselves in different parts of the world."
BJP leader ‘shames’ stalking victim on twitter; later claims account hacked,"Tribune News Service

Panaji, August 7

American hospitality group Marriott International Inc will have 100 operational hotels in the country by 2018, a top executive has said.

The world’s largest hotel chain which began its operations in the country in 1997 with a project in Goa, currently has 86 hotels and 15 brands spanning 35 cities.

“Marriott International has 86 hotels in the country and we are the biggest hotel company in the world. We have so far opened four hotels in the country this year and will open six more during the year,” Marriott International South Asia president Neeraj Govil told PTI during opening of Le Meridian at Calangute in the coastal state.

He said they were looking at tertiary cities like Indore, Amritsar, Coimbatore, Jaipur and others for more properties.

“We will hit our hundred in 2018. We also have another 100 hotels in the pipeline, so we are looking at opening somewhere between 15 and 20 hotels a year in the country every year over the next five years,” Govil said.

He said the tourism growth had been very strong due to the measures introduced by the government which had made the destinations more people-friendly. “One of the pillars of growth, as projected by the government is tourism. The government is also very proactive in infrastructure development which helps bring in a lot more people.”

Marriott as a company, he said, is targeting all the customers, be it leisure or groups. “Most importantly, we’ve turned our focus towards domestic consumers. Because we’ve 15 brands we play at various price points. We don’t get into the market from pricing perspective. We try to win the customers.”

The hotel chain nets 75 per cent of its business from domestic consumers.

The company, a couple of weeks ago, launched an initiative called ‘Shadi by Marriott’, a wedding-focused campaign. “It’s a big signal that consumer here is the consumer of today and the future,” he said. It is looking at different kinds of weddings, including overseas, seven-star, five-star, beach wedding, destination wedding and others.

“We have 86 hotels and 15 brands, so there is a brand for every segment. Annual growth is high double-digit. Since the time we have been here, we’ve been growing above the market and also growing our market share,” Govil said. PTI"
Politically incorrect,"MOVIE REVIEW - INDU SARKAR

Nonika Singh

Sorry to disappoint you readers, but Indu Sarkar isn’t about the enigmatic former Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, who was loved and despised in equal measure. The title (Indu we all know was her nickname and Sarkar needs no qualifier) might have misled you in believing so.

But the film in the eye of controversy for some time, zeroes down on her most inglorious phase; the draconian and dreaded Emergency.

Expectedly, the narrative takes sides and does seem politically motivated as well. However, Indira’s presence is confined to the margins, just a scene or two - that too sans dialogues. Instead, it’s her son who gets ample footage. By the way, neither of them is referred to by actual names. However, the resemblance to real characters is telling and uncanny. And Bhandarkar has left no stones unturned to demonise Sanjay Gandhi - sorry, beg your pardon, chief as he is alluded to throughout the film.

His body language, dialogues or the mean act and references to his five-point programme including nasbandi … all are meant to paint him as the big bad boy of mommy dear, who, of course, is not Indu Sarkar.

So who is the titular character? Well, a fictitious woman coined by Bhandarkar who has gone on record to say the film is 70 per cent fiction and only 30 per cent fact. And it’s this marriage of reality with imagination that is rather problematic. Who can deny that a film on Emergency should be made?

Emergency is without a doubt a period that even Congress can’t be proud of. But by mixing facts with fiction, by trying to humanise the story of an orphan girl, Indu, caught in the vortex of political repression and then turning it into a thriller of sorts, the film neither remains truly political nor a riveting, heart-tugging, human drama.

Besides, to compare the fight against Emergency to the second freedom movement is stretching the yarn a bit too far. The use of National Song, Vande Mataram, as the anthem of the so-called peaceful revolutionaries too is rather distressing, if not in bad taste. All through the film you can’t shirk off the nagging doubt and realisation that Bhandarkar would gave gained in stature had he made the film during the Congress regime.

Today, his attempt seems like a government-pleaser stunt. In the film there is one key dialogue; Emergency main ya police ki chalti hai ya yes man ki. The same dialogue can be turned against the director.

Indeed, it’s tragic that 70 years after Independence, films on political subjects, that too not biting enough, are made in accordance with who is ruling at that point. And that is a bigger tragedy than the film itself, which despite sepia tones and occasional period touches (Bobby is running in theatres), also succumbs to the typical Bollywood plot.

However, one person that emerges tall is Kirti Kulhari. As the stammering poet-turned-rebel, she engages you with her dilemmas, more so in the first part. To a large extent her screen spouse, Actor Tota Roy Chowdhury, playing her ambitious husband, a government servant willing to play along with the powers that be, gets the nuances of his character right. Neil Nitin Mukesh as the near despicable chief spurning and mocking his loyalists too adds menace to his part. Only if Bhandarkar, who has been losing his touch lately, found his métier. From the man who gave us incisive Page 3 and fairly credible Fashion, we expected and deserved better."

40-day Amarnath yatra ends with 2.6 lakh pilgrims offering prayers,"Srinagar, August 7

The 40-day annual pilgrimage to the Amarnath shrine in south Kashmir Himalayas ended today, with 2.60 lakh pilgrims offering prayers this year despite a terror attack on a bus that left eight devotees dead.

The pilgrimage concludes on the festival of Raksha Bandhan each year.

This year's figure of pilgrims visiting the shrine is the second lowest in the past 14 years. Last year, only 2.20 lakh pilgrims had visited the cave shrine due to the summer unrest.

The holy mace of Lord Shiva -- Chhari Mubarak -- carried by a group of 'sadhus' and devotees led by its custodian Mahant Deepindra Giri, arrived at the holy cave in the early hours for day-long prayers, officials of the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) said.

The group of sadhus and devotees trekked 42 km from Pahalgam to reach the shrine with night halts at Chandanwari, Sheshnag and Panchtarani.

After traditional rituals at the sanctum sanctorum, the holy mace would start the return journey before dusk later today.

While the holy cave will be closed for darshan from today, pujan and visarjan (immersion) ceremonies for the journey of Chhari Mubarak would be performed on the banks of Lidder river in Pahalgam on 9 August.

It will be followed by a traditional open kitchen, the last ritual of the pilgrimage.

The holy mace would return to its abode at Amareshwar temple at Dashnami Akhara here the same day, the officials said.

The yatra had commenced from Pahalgam and Baltal routes amid strict security arrangements on 29 June.

While stringent security arrangement had been put in place for the yatra, Lashkar-e-Taiba militants managed to target a bus full of pilgrims on 10 July.

Eight pilgrims were killed while 21 others were injured in the attack.

Forty other pilgrims, including 16 in a road accident on Jammu-Srinagar Highway on 16 July, died during this edition of the pilgrimage with cardiac arrest being the major cause of deaths due to medical reasons.

Meanwhile, hundreds of Hindus -- mostly labourers from other states of the country -- today made a beeline for the Shankaracharya Temple atop the Zabarwan hills here to take part in prayers to mark the culmination of the yatra.

The devotees, residing in various parts of the city, started their journey to the temple by foot before day break.

"Aamit clinches second medal, wins silver in 400m","WORLD PARA JUNIOR CHAMPIONSHIPS

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 6

Punjab’s Aamit Kumar won his second medal at the World Para Athletics Junior (U20) Championships after finishing second in the 400 metres T42-T47 at Nottwil, Switzerland, on Saturday. The 18-year-old won the silver medal in 51.26 seconds, finishing behind Japan’s Suzuki Yudai (50.35s). Aamit, who had won the gold medal in the 200m on Thursday, was delighted to have won two medals at the prestigious event. However, he was not satisfied with his performance in the 400m final. “He is not satisfied with his performance as his personal best is around 50 seconds,” said Jagbir Singh, who has been training Aamit at the Punjab Institute of Sports centre at Anandpur Sahib for three years. “Aamit said he was a bit stiff as he hadn’t fully recovered after his 200m win. But I am really happy, it is a big achievement. He sounded very happy as well,” the coach added.

Kashmiri doctor plays key role in gene editing of human embryos in US,"For the first time, genetically modified human embryos have been developed in the US and Kashmir-born doctor Sanjeev Kaul has played a lead role in this breakthrough.

(Follow

Scientists have now demonstrated an effective way of using a gene-editing tool to correct a disease-causing gene mutation in human embryos and stop it from passing to future generations.

Though this is not a full-fledged start of a revolution of having ‘designer babies’, the first steps, however, have been laid. China attempted this earlier.

A team of scientists has altered human embryos using a new technique called CRISPR CAS9 that edits genes and in this case it helped remove a fatal mutation that leads to heart attacks.

This now opens up an ethical ‘Pandora’s Box’ if germline repairs and enhancements may become a thing in vogue.

As of now, the human embryos were not implanted in humans. But this now opens up exciting prospects of the world having designer babies soon.

The research published in British journal Nature shows the first genetically modified human embryos made in America.

A team of South Korean, Chinese and American scientists has identified how they could edit out a faulty gene that causes heart attacks in later life due to the thickening of heart walls.

One of the team members is Dr Kaul, who was born in Kashmir, studied in New Delhi and later immigrated to America.

“Although the rare heart mutation affects men and women of all ages, it is a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young people, and it could be eliminated in one generation in a particular family,” said co-author Kaul, a professor of medicine (cardiovascular medicine) in the OHSU School of Medicine and director of the OHSU Knight Cardiovascular Institute.

“Thanks to advances in stem cell technologies and gene editing, we are finally starting to address disease-causing mutations that impact potentially millions of people,” says Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor in California-based Salk Institutes Gene Expression Laboratory and a corresponding author of the paper.

“Gene editing is still in its infancy so even though this preliminary effort was found to be safe and effective, it is crucial that we continue to proceed with the utmost caution, paying the highest attention to ethical considerations.” CRISPR CAS9 or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats is a kind of a precise molecular scissor the scientists use to edit faulty genes.

Only selected healthy embryos were allowed to grow further that too only for a few days. The embryos were not implanted in humans.

The big step forward is that a higher percentage embryos were found to have been repaired in this American experiment than earlier attempts.

CRISPR holds promise for correcting mutations in the human genome to prevent genetic disease. Using an enzyme called Cas9, it is possible to snip a specific target sequence on a mutant gene.

The new study found that human embryos effectively repair these breaks in the mutant gene using the normal copy of this gene from a second parent as a template.

The resulting embryos contain now repaired, mutation-free copies of this gene.

The technique already has been used in animals for generating mutant models; however, the new study is the first to demonstrate that technique can be used in human embryos to convert mutant genes back to normal.

The study also demonstrated a way for overcoming a crucial problem in genome editing in embryos known as mosaicism.

Mosaicism refers to an outcome when not all cells in a multicellular embryo get repaired and some cells still carry a mutation.

“Every generation on would carry this repair because we have removed the disease-causing gene variant from that family’s lineage,” said senior author Shoukhrat Mitalipov, PhD, who directs the Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), in Portland, Oregon, USA.

“By using this technique, it is possible to reduce the burden of this heritable disease on the family and eventually the human population.”

The study provides new insight into a technique that could apply to thousands of inherited genetic disorders affecting millions of people worldwide.

The gene-editing technique described in this study, done in concert with in vitro fertilisation, could provide a new avenue for people with known heritable disease-causing genetic mutations to eliminate the risk of passing the disease to their children.

“If proven safe, this technique could potentially decrease the number of cycles needed for people trying to have children free of genetic disease,” said co-author Paula Amato, associate professor of obstetrics and gynaecology in the OHSU School of Medicine.

Designer babies could be in the offing.

“Our results demonstrate the great potential of embryonic gene editing, but we must continue to realistically assess the risks as well as the benefits,” adds Belmonte.

In this landmark study, the researchers worked with healthy donated human oocytes and sperm carrying the genetic mutation that causes cardiomyopathy or the thickening of heart walls.

Embryos created in this study were used to answer pre- clinical questions about safety and effectiveness. The study noted that “genome editing approaches must be further optimised” before moving to clinical trials.

“This research significantly advances scientific understanding of the procedures that would be necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of germline gene correction,” said Daniel Dorsa, senior vice president for research at OHSU.

“The ethical considerations of moving this technology to clinical trials are complex and deserve significant public engagement before we can answer the broader question of whether it’s in humanity’s interest to alter human genes for future generations.”

Existing ethical guidelines did not permit the team to implant the genetically modified human embryos into women. PTI"
Lead with winning combos,"Choosing the right mix of subjects in your bachelor’s of arts course is the key to a successful career

Gauri Chhabra

An increasing number of students have been gravitating towards Humanities stream and a bachelor in arts degree over the past few years. The competititon for “hot” subject combinations for UG courses is very fierce, especially in Delhi University colleges and even in other cities like Chandigarh. BA is no more considered to be an easy option and career-oriented students take extreme care in choosing the subject combinations that will keep them relevant in the job market later on. However, once the students choose to go this route, they face confusion about the subject combinations they need to choose from. Here are some winning subject options that would hold you in good stead and cover maximum surface area for choosing career options:

Psychology- Sociology-Economics

Jain University, Bangalore

AIMS Institute, Bangalore

The Oxford College of Arts, Bangalore

Christ University, Bangalore

St. Xavier's College- Autonomous, Mumbai

A BA with this combinations will open doors in economic, social, and fields of psychology. Sociology and economics as social sciences are closely related. While economics deals with the production, consumption and distribution of wealth, sociology allows us to study these aspects in relation to the societal structures.

Job prospects

This is one of the best combinations that provides an opportunity to specialise in any one of the three main subjects. Most graduates with a bachelor’s degree in psychology who don’t go on to further study find work in fields such as business administration, sales or education. You can also find work in the community and social services sector as counselors, mental health workers and psychiatric aides, or in criminal justice/forensic psychology as correctional and police officers, parole and probation officers, and interviewers for various criminal justice agencies. NGOs and International organizations are also seeking who have studied psychology. You may also find work as sociology research assistants, but most of you wind up in other fields, such as social services, administration, management, or sales and marketing. An undergraduate degree in sociology might also qualify college graduates to work as case managers, child care workers or homeless/housing workers or move into education administration or teaching,. Studying economics will equip you with a strong grasp of economic principles which will help to make more informed decision and get into the government sector, banks, accountancy, insurance companies, regulatory bodies etc.

Sociology-Political Science- Economics

BBK DAV College for Women, Amritsar

Christ University, Bangalore

St. Joseph's College, Bangalore

Elphistone College, Mumbai

This subject combination actually prepares you to become a generalist that the civil services exam requires. The other interesting fields such as journalism and mass-communication, law, management, NGOs, education, film making etc are open for further exploration. Students also get empowered enough to set up their own start-ups and entrepreneurial ventures.

Job prospects

Sociology offers several enticing career options due to the different specialisations that one can choose from. Research institutes, the criminal justice system, public health and welfare organisations, private businesses, law firms, international agencies, medical centers, educational institutions, advertising firms, survey and polling organizations are only some of the example where people from this background are required. There are options of working in other sectors with area specialists to help function. Being a sociologist asks for a lot of patience along with dedication to the work. Employers will look for people with good communication and research skills along with the capacity for detailed observation. After completing bachelor’s/master’s program in political science, several opportunities are available in both government and private sectors. Politics, public administration, law, and marketing fields are always in need of good political scientists. Political scientists can even opt for campaign management, polling and electoral politics, and university and college teaching. The career prospects in political science have widened enough in the voluntary organisations and NGOs. The international voluntary organisations, like UNO, have huge scope for proficient political scientists across the world. Besides, they can join media houses as political journalists and political researchers/analysts. Economics is perhaps the only Arts course that requires the student to be ‘swift’ in maths. While most economists have advanced degrees (in most cases a PhD), there are many lucrative career opportunities for those choosing economics at the undergraduate level. Data analysis, banking and finance, and market analysis are some avenues open to aspirants. Some even go on to becoming stock brokers.

Journalism-Psychology and Elective English

This combination is beneficial to provide a firm foundation for the students to either go directly get into media or go in for higher studies.

You can work in news and media companies or take up teaching in government and private schools both on private and regular basis. HR, health associated professions, hospitals etc. offer an exciting and amazing career path for students of psychology.

Pertaining to journalism and English, some of the options include writing for national, regional and local newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations and online publications and companies involved in public relation, corporate communications, content writing and marketing. You can pursue post-graduation and expand it with further studies.

The journalism course aims at moulding the student for a career in both print and broadcasting and in allied fields like advertising, film, and PR. The course introKristu Jayanti College, Bangalore"
Large age gap may erode marital satisfaction,"Washington

Men and women who have younger spouses are happier with their marriage, but this marital satisfaction fades over time in couples who have a significant age gap, a study has found.

The findings, which examined 13 years of data from thousands of households, also suggest that marriages with large age gaps are less resilient in the face of economic downturns relative to their similarly-aged counterparts.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the findings show that men reported greater marital satisfaction when paired with a younger spouse, especially in the early years of marriage.

However, the reverse appears to be true as well.

""We find that men who are married to younger wives are the most satisfied, and men who are married to older wives are the least satisfied,"" said Terra McKinnish, a professor at University of Colorado Boulder in the US.

""Women are also particularly dissatisfied when they're married to older husbands and particularly satisfied if they're married to younger husbands,"" said McKinnish.

That initial satisfaction erodes rapidly, however, after 6-10 years of marriage for the couples with a big age gap between the partners.

""Over time, the people who are married to a much older or younger spouse tend to have larger declines in marital satisfaction over time compared to those who are married to spouses who are similar in age,"" said McKinnish.

One mechanism for this decline could be how the age difference between spouses affects the couple's ability to respond to negative economic shocks, such as a job loss, McKinnish said.

""We looked at how couples respond to negative shocks and in particular, if they have a major bad economic shock or worsening of their household finances,"" she said.

""We find that when couples have a large age difference, that they tend to have a much larger decline in marital satisfaction when faced with an economic shock than couples that have a very small age difference,"" she added.

A possible explanation for this is that similarly-aged couples are more in sync on life decisions that affect both partners (having children; general spending habits) and thus may be better equipped to adjust to a negative financial shock, McKinnish said.

By contrast, an unexpected financial shakeup could expose underlying tensions and mismatches in couples with a larger age gap.

The study was published in the Journal of Population Economics. —PTI"
"Not just babies, breastfeeding good for mothers too","New Delhi

One of the most important aspects of motherhood is breastfeeding the newborn. Breastfed infants have a stronger immune system and are healthier in the longer term.

“Although much has been written about the benefits of breastfeeding in infants, what is also true is that it is beneficial for the mothers as well. Ranging from helping in losing post pregnancy kilos to averting the risk of breast cancer, nursing the infant is a win-win situation for both the mother and the baby,” says Dr Nandita Palshetkar.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

The early motherhood phase is full of hormonal changes as the body gets back to a more normal routine post pregnancy. It is natural for women to feel low, tired, and agitated, thanks to lack of sleep and frequent breastfeeding sessions. There may be times when all they want to do is give up feeding and get the baby habituated to a bottle.

However, it is important to understand that the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and the baby outweigh all these emotional and physical changes.

The first few days after birth, the breasts make what is called the ""first milk"" or colostrum. This is a thick, yellow liquid and is rich in nutrients essential for the newborn. Colostrum also helps in the development of the digestive tract in the newborn and further, in digesting breast milk. And the benefits do not just stop at the baby but extend to the mother as well.

There is a fear in some women that breastfeeding will hamper their physical appearance. However, the fact is that this practice only has benefits for them. Here are some reasons why.

Studies indicate that in women who breastfeed regularly, the chances of developing breast cancer come down by as much as 25%. The longer a mother breastfeeds, the lesser she is at a risk of getting breast cancer. Additionally, this practice also reduces the chances of uterine and ovarian cancer. The low estrogen levels in this phase help keep cancers at bay.

Breastfeeding aids in family planning. This is because it delays ovulation by producing prolactin. Prolactin delays the production of estrogen and progesterone and therefore keeps the ovulation in check. Thus, breastfeeding is also a way to practice natural child spacing for mothers. Nursing mothers have better emotional health according to studies. Women who breastfeed frequently have lesser chances of developing postpartum anxiety and depression and bond better with their baby.

Research indicates that women who do not breastfeed have a four times greater chance of developing osteoporosis. They also tend to suffer more hip fractures post menopause. Not only this, breastfeeding helps a woman shed all that pregnancy weight. Nursing the baby is known to burn around 500 calories a day. It also reduces the hip circumference and helps new mothers lose fat. Nursing the baby helps in the production of oxytocin, which helps the uterus contract faster post childbirth. It also helps in controlling excessive blood loss in new mothers.

Pregnancy decreases glucose tolerance and raises resistance to insulin, thereby increasing the chances of gestational diabetes. Also, the additional fat stored during pregnancy can increase the chances of diabetes in women. Studies confirm that lactation helps in balancing this condition in the mother. A study has found that in a woman who breastfed her baby for a longer duration, the chances of Type 2 diabetes come down significantly.

Some added benefits

Not only is breastfeeding beneficial for health but also cost effective as it does not incur any costs unlike formula milk. Depending upon the brand, type and amount consumed, formula milk can weigh heavily on the pocket but not provide the health benefits that a mother's milk can give. Naturally nursing the baby is also environment friendly as it does not generate waste in the form of plastic bottles and formula cans.

Breastfeeding is a natural act for both the mother and baby. However, it does take some time for both to get adjusted to the routine and technique. Although there are numerous benefits of breastfeeding for mothers, nothing equals the sense of fulfillment and bonding it offers. It is a unique experience both for the mother and the baby and helps in developing a strong physical and emotional connection between the two. —ANI"

Paul Ryan, Speaker of the US House of Representatives, said: “Over the last five years, the people of Oak Creek have proved they’re stronger than hate and division.” Ryan represents the Congressional district in Wisconsin where a white supremacist went on a shooting rampage at a Sikh Gurdwara on August 5, 2012.“Five years ago, Oak Creek was rocked by a heinous attack on the Sikh Temple, and today we look back on that act of violence with solemn remembrance of those who were lost,” he said in a statement. “The Sikh community is in our thoughts on this fifth anniversary of the Oak Creek attack,” said Senator Ron Johnson. Eminent Indian-American from Indiana Gurinder Singh Khalsa said the Oak Creek tragedy was a wakeup call for the Sikh community. “The community needs to engage, educate and empower. Sikhs need to do more on the awareness front,” said Khalsa, founder and head of the Sikhs Political Action Committee. “At a time when divisive rhetoric has taken over our country, Sikhs have to remain vigilant while still staying in steadfast to their beliefs and principles,” said Baldev Singh from the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund. — PTI"
Tips for becoming a co-applicant in home loan,"Ravindra Rao

A home is the most popular, and will be the most enduring of all earthly establishments, said the late great American magician, Channing Pollock, about his abode. A home is perhaps the most prized possession for most of us and aspirational in every sense; the best address, important neighbours and all facilities that we would ever need in life. That costs a small fortune in many Indian cities but if you have a robust source of income and an impressive credit score, such dreams can be realised without much strain. However, for those who do not fulfil the income criteria for a substantial loan, a simple way to hone your overall financial prowess is to borrow jointly with your spouse or someone who can be designated as a co-borrower. Let’s understand the basics of this advantageous concept.A co-borrower can be an immediate family member, salaried or self-employed, who is an Indian or even an NRI. Depending on their discretion, lending institutions can allow up to six co-applicants which may include spouse, siblings and blood relatives like parents. Nevertheless, married couples get the highest preference as banks even assign a longer loan repayment tenure subject to the retirement age of the older applicant.Prospects of a bigger loan at a better rate brighten when an applicant adds co-applicants with a good credit score and an independent income source. It helps lenders consider the joint income of the applicants to assess their repayment capacity. But banks may insist that all co-owners of the property must be the co-applicants as well.A joint home loan bestows tax deduction benefits for both co-applicants separately, provided they are co-owners of the property and each of them is contributing to the home loan repayment. As per existing provisions, principal repayments are eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act for up to a maximum limit of Rs 1.50 lakh. In the case of interest payments, there is a tax deduction available under Section 24 up to Rs 2 lakh if the property is self-occupied (If the property is let out, then the entire interest becomes eligible for tax deduction). For a joint home loan, this takes the combined limit to Rs 3 lakh under Section 80C and Rs 4 lakh under Section 24(b) – which helps reduce a significant burden on the family.

Advantage for married applicants

Few important tips can enhance the overall benefit to married applicants. A couple must mutually work out the ownership share between themselves as co-borrowers to optimise tax benefits; either this can be in the ratio of 50:50 for claiming deductions in equal proportion or 60:40 or 70:30 depending on which co-borrower falls into what tax bracket – if he or she has a higher income, a bigger share of the property can help avail greater benefits. The actual amount of tax benefit given to each co-applicant would be in proportion to their contribution in repayment of principal and interest. Thus, it is even possible for co-applicants to decide how much tax benefit they would want, and at what proportion, each applicant would pay. In case of a woman applicant, many lenders would provide a differentiated interest rate - usually a few basis points below the normal home loan rates. For this, the applicant must be the sole or joint owner of the property and an applicant or co-applicant for the home loan. Joint home loan applicants can make payments from a single or joint account by way of cheques or ECS. Some institutions even allow co-borrowers to share the number of EMIs between them, depending on which they could decide the number of EMI cheques to be issued by each applicant. One borrower can pay all instalments while the other can refund his or her share by way of cheque or fund transfer to that account.A key factor that decides one’s loan eligibility is the credit worthiness of borrowers. When one applies for a loan or credit, a lender seeks the individual’s credit risk, evaluated by a credit score maintained by agencies. A credit report is the holistic sum of the applicant’s financial dealings in every sphere of life, interpreted as a number that is critical for getting not just loans or other means of credit, but even to qualify for them (banks can judge not just the applicant’s primary eligibility but even his/her ability and propensity to repay). It is prudent to keep a check on the credit report/credit score of an applicant as well as a co-applicant; as lower scores could impact one’s chances of obtaining finance for a home.Besides home loan documents, individual details such as KYC (proof of identity and address), income and property documents are required to avail the housing loan. Detailed documentation helps a lender to decide faster and beneficially in your favour. Income documents can be supported by other assets created by the applicants to show their prudent financial behaviour. Though there would be multiple borrowers, the documentation process for joint home loans remains much like that of individual home loans. Despite its enormous benefits, one may avoid applying for a joint home loan if the credit score of the co-owner is low due to a poor credit history or if he/she is already repaying an ongoing loan that has consumed maximum loan eligibility or if he/she is intending to buy a bigger property in the future for self-occupancy or if he/she is about to retire.

Managing loan and finances

A joint home loan is not only about saving in terms of principal and interest payment to a great extent, but also about sharing an honorable and real responsibility towards a home. Many couples would agree that such a joint move has instilled a sense of discipline – especially financial prudence – in them where both partners feel proud for contributing towards mutual benefit. Yet, one must not take hasty decisions in terms of finalising a house or taking a huge loan (it may turn out expensive over the tenure with fewer benefits). Couples must undertake basic financial planning before committing to a huge monthly payout which may hamstring regular needs or individual desire to acquire something personal. As TS Elliot said, “Home is where one starts from.” Home loan is where one could learn much from – as co-borrowers.

BJP’s in-charge of Haryana rules out Barala’s resignation,"Chandigarh, August 7

Senior BJP leader Anil Jain, in-charge of the party’s Haryana affairs, on Monday ruled out the resignation of its state unit chief Subhash Barala following the arrest of the latter’s son in a stalking case here.

“Subhash Barala has nothing to with the Vikas Barala case. The law is taking its own course. There is no reason for Subhash Barala’s resignation,” Jain said in a statement here.

Jain’s statement ruling out Barala’s resignation comes a day after Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar also said that the BJP state unit chief had “nothing to do with incident”.

The opposition has been mounting pressure seeking Subhash Barala’s resignation on the issue.

“Subhash Barala has nothing to do with this incident. It is an individual happening, the accused will face action once found guilty. This is my official stand, this was my stand yesterday and today also this is my stand. After this, on this issue, no question, no answer,” Khattar had told reporters yesterday.

Subhash Barala had earlier said that he respects the law and the “truth” will come out through the judicial process.

The son of Haryana’s ruling BJP chief was arrested along with his friend for allegedly stalking a woman here.

Both the accused, Vikas Barala (23) and Ashish Kumar (27), were released later on bail as they were booked under bailable Sections of the IPC and the Motor Vehicles Act, amid a major outcry.

The incident came to light when the woman, around 28 years of age, called up the police on Friday night and complained that two youth were chasing her.

Meanwhile, Haryana Congress chief Ashok Tanwar today met the victim and her family at her residence here and assured her of support in fighting the case.

A protest march was also taken out here over the incident.

“We appreciate the brave girl for standing up to harassment by two men, one of them belonging to an influential family. The whole of Chandigarh stands by her side,” said a citizen.

A Congress worker also accused the Chandigarh Police of acting under pressure in the stalking case to protect the accused. — PTI"

One-size-fits-all scheme ill-suited to state; individual’s crop loss not taken into account; hefty premiums a concern for the govt as well as farmers

07 Aug 2017 | 1:18 AM

CHANDIGARH: Crop loss for any reason is a setback farmers of Punjab – most of whom are small – can hardly sustain.

[ + read story ]

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 6

Crop loss for any reason is a setback farmers of Punjab – most of whom are small – can hardly sustain. Yet, there are no takers in the state for the crop insurance scheme offered by the Central Government. The state has some very valid reasons for that, all simple economics. At a larger level, it is the ‘one size fits all’ approach of successive governments that may be to blame.

As the arrangements stand today, what a farmer in Punjab gets is “compensation” for the damage. But this mostly remains meaningless, as often the relief is Rs 5,000, or even smaller amounts, paid by the state government for losses of up to Rs 40,000-50,000 per acre.

The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) was touted as a radical solution for its beneficiaries by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Ground realities, however, reveal that it has turned out to be another money-spinner dished out by insurance companies, facilitated by the government. Farmers of Punjab say they had no say in the formulation of the policy so crucial to them.

THE PUNJAB EXPERIENCE

Thus far, Punjab, Sikkim, Manipur and Nagaland have not implemented the PMFBY, while it is operational or will be soon in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Odisha, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam.

Old-timers like Bishan Singh and Bachan Singh of Khaira Dona village in Kapurthala district recall that farmers have been the losers in all farm insurance schemes implemented by the Centre since the Individual Approach Basis Scheme was launched in 1972. They have memories of the ‘great flood’ of 1962 and the pittance received as compensation. A few rupees, some blankets, but no “insurance”. Officially, nearly 20 per cent of the cropped area was damaged in floods that year as compared to 13 per cent and 10 per cent in 2009 (15 dead) and 1988 (200 dead), respectively.

In well-irrigated Punjab, those were the heady days of the Green Revolution (paddy was recording an increase of 5.30 per cent per annum), whereas most of the insurance schemes were tailor-made for rain-fed agriculture of many other states.

The Comprehensive Crop Insurance Scheme (CCIS- 1985) focused largely on drought, whereas the state’s farmers wanted only insurance for hailstorm but with higher indemnity. Successive governments – both the SAD and the Congress – over the decades only paid lip service on this count. Policies were framed, scrapped and re-framed, but turned out to be just old wine in fancy new bottles each time, says BS Rajewal of the BKU.

WHY PMFBY DOESN’T WORK

In its present avatar, the major flaw in the farm insurance scheme is that it comes into play only if there is 40 per cent crop damage in a village, which is counted as a single unit for availing any relief, says Rajewal.

First, farmers want that instead of being village-specific, the scheme should be farm plot-specific, with crop indemnity (compensation) levels above 95 per cent.

Secondly, farmers demand that the 10-year benchmark for assessing ‘normal’ yield levels while deciding on the insurance premium should be scrapped, and the latest yield should be taken into account.

The premium should also be standardised to 1 per cent for all crops, as crop losses in Punjab are very low as compared to the rest of the country.

Thirdly, the crop lying in market yards should also be covered. At present, only the harvested crop in the fields lies within the ambit of the scheme. Largely mechanised harvesting operations and relatively easy access to markets in Punjab ensure that the crop reaches mandis within hours. Hence, it needs protection from the vagaries of weather in the mandi, where it may await procurement for days.

In view of stiff opposition by the peasantry and farmer unions, the scheme has been given a quiet burial by the state government.

In a meeting on this issue with senior officials of the Union Agriculture Ministry and the insurance companies a couple of years ago, Rajewal says he asked if the rationale of the entire village being a single unit was applied to vehicles or life insurance. Would the company only settle claims if 40 people died or 40 vehicles were involved in a pile-up? Needless to say, that was the end of it, he added.

Haryana implemented the scheme and its farmers have alleged that the insurance companies collected over Rs 750 crore in premium, but only disbursed Rs 112 crore as compensation. The matter was even raised in Parliament, Rajewal claims.

KEEP ARHTIYA OUT

Buta Singh Burj Gill, president of the BKU (Dakaunda), too minces no words in denouncing the scheme in its present form as anti-farmer and pro-corporate. We desperately need insurance but not at these costs and terms, he added.

There are no takers for even premiums heavily subsidised by the Centre and the states (in equal proportion). Farmers pay 2 per cent of the premium for kharif crops, 1.5 per cent for rabi and 5 per cent for horticulture crops. On an average, a farmer has to pay Rs 800 per acre for rabi and kharif crops and Rs 1,250 per acre for cotton as premium. They are not able to bear that cost.

The need is to scrap the arhtiya system. The money/profits collected by this system under the present procurement arrangement can be used to pay the PMFBY premium, saving both farmers and the government this recurring fiscal burden once and for all, Gill suggests.

The Mandi Board is equipped to buy the produce from the farmers, and everyone would be more than willing to clean the crop, weigh it and transport it to the nearest state godown. This would not only provide employment to the landless labourers, but also mean an additional income for the farmers on freight charges, he pointed out. As it is, farmers transport the produce to the mandis.

When the government knows that the farmers are fiscally distressed and committing suicides, why burden them with another life-long liability, asks Gill.

UNRESPONSIVE STATE GOVTS

Punjab’s reluctance to implement the PMFBY also drew the attention of Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, who told the Rajya Sabha recently that the state should seriously consider implementing the scheme as it had neither sent a draft for drought relief nor done crop insurance in the past five years.

“I have seen the record of the state; Punjab’s farmers do not go in for crop insurance. But during drought, even a request for relief was not made to us,” he added.

Under the PMFBY, there would be no upper limit on the subsidy provided by the Centre or the state. “Even if the balance premium (after farmers’ contribution) is 90 per cent, it will be borne by the government,” according to an official.

In previous schemes, the premium had been capped, which resulted in low claims being paid to farmers. This was done to limit the government outgo on the premium subsidy. “This has been removed. Farmers will get the claim against the full sum insured without any deductions,” the official says.

Another benefit of the PMFBY is that losses incurred from the sowing stage to the post-harvest season would all be covered. Earlier, only post-harvest losses could be offset. Farmers who haven’t availed bank loans would also be eligible for insurance cover.

Solution in guaranteed income; production, market risk both coverED

While farmer unions have been agitating for implementing the MS Swaminathan Commission recommendations and bureaucrats are clueless on what to do, a report by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, in 2014 suggested that a study of all insurance schemes since 1974 till date had revealed that opting for the Farm Income Insurance Scheme (FIIS-2003-04) would be the best bet for Punjab.

As this is the sole scheme covering both production and market risk, it could also be used for giving a boost to the flagging diversification drive of the state, the PAU study observed.

It envisages targeting two critical components that decides a farmer’s income — yield and price — through a single policy instrument by ensuring a “minimum guaranteed income” determined by using the average yield for the previous seven years and the MSP. If the actual income falls short of the guaranteed sum, the farmer would be eligible for compensation to the extent of indemnity from the Agricultural Insurance Company (AIC) of India."
Just another dazzler,"MOVIE REVIEW - VALERIAN AND THE CITY OF A THOUSAND PLANETS

Johnson Thomas

The comic book ‘Valerian et Laureline’ created by Pierre Christin and drawn by Jean-Claude Mezieres( all of 21 volumes from 1967 to 2010), gets a cinematic lifeline in Luc Besson’s ‘Valerian and The City of a Thousand Planets.’ This one is obviously one of many more to come and it’s a dazzler no doubt.

Set in the 28th century, year 2550, way beyond anything imagined so far, in a sort of going beyond Star Wars effort, Besson pulls out all the stops to showcase a vigorously vibrant and colourful world of ideas that unfortunately don’t go any further than the pages it once enhanced.

The minister of defense(Herbie Hancock) commissions two special operatives Valerian(Dane DeHaan) and Laureline(Cara Delevingne), for a intergalactic intelligence mission to save Alpha- a multi-cultural, multi racial metropolis invaded by a dark force that threatens to destroy the peaceful city and the entire universe in the bargain. It’s always the same load of crap in different forms I guess.

This is Besson’s show-piece effort and he is obviously in show-off mode trying to outdo every great sci-fi filmmaker history has known. And in tech-smarts with millions of dollars at his command, he certainly makes his mark. It’s the narrative impetuosity that puts paid to any deeper affect though.

The movie experience is not all that satisfying. For one, the lead cast, 20 something lean and skilled, brown and blonde haired duo, don’t even look remotely like the more mature black haired he-man and luscious red head duo depicted in the comic book.

Also, the narrative goes all over the place trying to outdo every sci-fi actioner seen before – so what you get is largely a mish-mash of genre types. It is appealing nevertheless, for its exquisitely enticing CGI and motion capture incandescence. There’s beauty in the visuals but the impact is immediate, not long lasting.

This overly ornate sci-fi attempt does manage to create some interest with its entertaining dialogues and the sparkling chemistry between its leads. The romance between them in fact has more lasting power than the hi-tech glitz on show here. The special effects overshadow every other aspect of the film including story, plot and performances.

Rihanna gets an eye-popping cameo that lasts much longer than necessary and there are amiable characters galore that catch the eye but fail to stay memorable. In fact most of the talent on show here have little to do other than mark their presence in a possible franchise overture. At 137 minutes, it’s also a little too long in the tooth to be consistently sufferable.

The tech hi-jinks may herald Besson as the next big thing on the sci-fi horizon but the lack of soul in the presentation of it is terribly belittling. This is a classic case of arrested evolution...what a pity!"
"Legalise drugs, get rid of addiction","Rajendra P Jindal

It is time to try a new approach to the drug problem. Those who want to use drugs know where to get them. No law has yet been able to dissuade them. Legalise, regulate and tax drugs to the hilt. Spend the money that would have gone towards preventive laws on education, healthcare and rehabilitation.

Rajendra P Jindal

TWO different news, apparently unrelated, made it to the newspapers a fortnight or so back. The first of these appeared, possibly, in The Tribune, with the headline “81 lakh lesser tobacco consumers since 2010”. The other news item appeared the very next day, and was titled ""Punjab Inspector held for drug trafficking"" The same evening, it was prominently splashed on all television channels. It continued to be followed in the media for the next couple of days until it was drowned by similar news. An ordinary reader may be excused for not seeing any relation between these two. But let us take them one by one. It may be news to most readers that tobacco (nicotine) is a drug too, albeit a legal one, in all the senses of the word that “drug” conveys. Until a few years ago, rich and powerful tobacco companies in the US, most of the medical researchers and doctors (the latter too on the payroll of tobacco companies) refused to admit that tobacco is a drug. It was contended that it is, at worst, a habit-forming substance only. With the help of PET and MRI scans, it has been conclusively proved that nicotine creates the same biochemical and molecular effects in the brain as any other drug such as cocaine and heroin and many other activities such as a kiss, a hug or a word of praise. This effect is known as elevation of a neurotransmitter substance (a chemical which carries messages from one micro part of the brain to the other) called “Dopamine”. The surge in the level of Dopamine produces a feeling of pleasure, at least initially. This effect is not common to the same degree in everybody; probably it is modified by a genetic factor. Therefore, whereas some people can ""take it and leave it"", others become addicted. Smoking or chewing tobacco is as addictive as any other drug and as difficult to get rid of. It gives the same sense of pleasure and the physical ill-effects are much more than any other drug. No other drug causes fatal cancers, heart and chest problems and many serious ailments. The interesting question that arises is: how were 81 lakh people able to give it up without even a single one ever being arrested or put into jail? No amount of tobacco was confiscated and no police officer or politician was ever accused of dealing with tobacco. One reason is that unlike other drugs, tobacco was never prohibited. Secondly, it is the education by various means and at various fora about the ill-effects of tobacco that has worked the miracle. In school and college textbooks, on radio and television as well as cigarette advertisement boards and even cigarette packets, ill-effects of smoking are prominently displayed. Most people seem to know that smoking causes the cancer of the lungs, even if they know nothing else. Therefore, compared to many more than those who have given up smoking are those who want to and are trying to give up smoking. As far as the other news that a Punjab Police Sub-inspector was held for drug trafficking, nobody should have trouble believing that the episode is only the tip of the iceberg. A junior police officer cannot run a drug empire without the collusion of colleagues and seniors. In the run-up to the Punjab Assembly elections, the chiefs of at least two of the political parties declared that they will totally abolish the drug menace from Punjab within a month of coming to power. The one who is now the Chief Minister, sotto voce, scaled the peak of rhetoric and ignorance when he declared that “the back of the drug trade has been broken”. As the subsequent events, including the news in discussion have revealed, the demon called drug trade is healthy and well, thank you. Are these leaders innocent, ignorant, naive or plain simpletons? The drug trade will persist as long as our approach to handling it remains archaic. For some unknown reason, in contrast to smoking and consumption of alcohol, consuming drugs has always been considered a character flaw, a criminal activity. The dopamine hypothesis has proved that drug addiction is a disorder of the brain no different from that caused by nicotine and alcohol. It is a mental illness of similar nature. The right place for a drug addict, therefore, is a hospital and not a prison and the way to deal with drugs is not to prohibit them but to legalise them just as it is in the case of tobacco and alcohol. Why are we so keen and insistent on prohibiting drugs and not tobacco and alcohol, while the latter two are more harmful? It obviously cannot be because we are a nation with knee-jerk puritanism. In that case, we would prohibit alcohol also. There are two reasons for the insistence on drug prohibition. The drug trade will exist as long as there is prohibition that generates exorbitant profits for the drug lords like our Sub-inspector and his seniors as well as politicians. Also, we inherently want to punish narco-trafficking, not eradicate it. However, the most novel reason for drug prohibition so far has been propounded by the American author Barbara Ehrenreich. She feels that we cling to prohibition for the same reason one clings to so many other self -destructive habits like nicotine, cocaine and heroin: because of the way it makes us feel — good and self righteous. If we surrender now, it will send the wrong message. Says she, “Legal drugs, even if heavily taxed and extensively regulated would no doubt be cheaper than illegal ones. This could mean more people sampling them out of curiosity. This danger has to be weighed against the insidious marketing dynamics of illegal drugs whose widely inflated prices compel the user to become a pusher and a recruiter of new users”. It is time to try a new approach to the drug problem. The people who want to use drugs know where to get them and no law has yet dissuaded people from using them. Legalise, regulate and tax drugs to the hilt. Take the money that would have gone towards preventive laws and spend it on education, healthcare and rehabilitation. A word about rehabilitation too. Dopamine-related research has shown that abstinence, if maintained, not only halts the physical and psychological damage wrought by drugs but also reverses it in large measure. A majority of the rehabilitation centres, mushrooming all over and uniformly lacking sufficient staff with enough expertise (psychiatrists and psychotherapists) and dedication (nurses and helpers), are worse than prisons. An addict needs long treatment, perhaps running into months. During this period, there are failures but their rate is no different from that for other chronic diseases. Nearly half the recovering addicts fail to maintain complete abstinence after a year, about the same proportion of patients with diabetes and hypertension who fail to comply with their medication regimens. Therefore, occasional relapse only means that more treatment is required, not that the addict be imprisoned. Alcoholic Anonymous and Narcotic Anonymous are the two organisations which probably have the highest cure rate because their members never refer to themselves as “cured”; they always call themselves “recovering addicts”. We could begin with a drug like marijuana and see how abolishing prohibition works. Then, we could move on to more drugs. Doesn't it sound like an idea that might catch on?"
Sikh referee calls for unity after facing racial abuse online,"Singapore, August 4

A 33-year-old Singaporean Sikh referee has called for unity within the football community after he was subjected to racial abuse on social media following a match here. Sukhbir Singh had reportedly made some controversial decisions while officiating last Saturday’s International Champions Cup (ICC) match at the National Stadium in Singapore, where Inter Milan beat Chelsea 2-1. Singh awarded a penalty to Inter after striker Stevan Jovetic was brought down by Chelsea full-back Cesar Azpilicueta, and the second was disallowing a late equaliser by Blues forward Michy Batshuayi. Fifa match agent Baljit Rihal tagged Kick It Out who said that it had “received reports from the public on the racist abuse on social media aimed towards Singaporean Sikh referee during Chelsea’s friendly against Inter Milan”. Some netizens took to Twitter to criticise Singh’s decisions and commented on his ethnicity. “I wouldn’t say I’m affected by it because I haven’t read the tweets, but that doesn’t mean I condone racism. It’s (racism in football) something that definitely needs to be looked into. There should not be any bias towards anyone’s race,” Singh was quoted as saying by The Strait Times. Singh has called for unity within the football community and said everyone should be allowed to believe in what they believe in freely and participate in what they want to participate in, especially when it comes to sports. Sport is supposed to unite people and not divide us, he said. The anti-discrimination bureau ‘Kick It Out’ is investigating the incident, a move praised by Singh. He added that he had not experienced any racial abuse while refereeing locally, and has “not come under any circumstances where a report was needed”. PTI"
Kerala High Court lifts life ban on cricketer Sreesanth,"Kochi, August 7

In a relief to cricketer S Sreesanth, the Kerala High Court on Monday lifted the life ban imposed on him by the BCCI in the wake of the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal. In his order, Justice A Muhamed Mustaque also set aside all proceedings against Sreesanth initiated by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The court had earlier sought the BCCI’s stand on the plea by the cricketer challenging the life ban imposed upon him by the game’s governing body following the 2013 Indian Premier League-6 spot-fixing scandal. The BCCI had filed a counter-affidavit on the issue in the court in response to the plea by Sreesanth, who had challenged the life ban despite a court dropping all charges against the 34-year-old pacer. The cricket board had said, “The decision of the sessions court to acquit the petitioner from the criminal charges has no impact whatsoever on the decision of the internal disciplinary committee of the BCCI to ban the petitioner from playing cricket tournaments organised by the BCCI and/or its affiliates.”

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

It had said the question before the court was whether the petitioner (and other accused) was liable to incur penal consequences under relevant criminal statutes. On the other hand, the question before the BCCI Disciplinary Committee was whether the petitioner was guilty of match-fixing, corruption and gambling and violation of the internal disciplinary rules of the BCCI, the board had said. The standard of proof required under a penal statute was much higher than the proof required for a disciplinary inquiry, it had said. All the 36 accused, including Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila were let off in the spot-fixing case by a Patiala House court in July 2015. The BCCI, however, had refused to alter its disciplinary decision even after the verdict."
"50 paise hike in apple MSP a cruel joke, say farmers","Seek Rs 12 per kg increase under market intervention scheme

Kuldeep Chauhan

Tribune News Service

Shimla, August 6

Terming a hike of 50 paise per kg in support price for apple this season as a cruel joke on farmers, the score of farmer bodies demanded that the government, if really wanted to help the farmers, should hike the support price to minimal Rs 12 per kg under the market intervention scheme (MIS). Not only this, the farmers warned the government not to sell the fruit procured under MIS from the farmers in the markets as it led to crash in the fruit markets that, in turn, cut down on their profit margins and helped only commission agents and traders. They also demanded a good network of procurement centres in the apple belt, adding that the fruit should not be procured in 40 kg ‘kattas’ since the procurement was done per kg not on the basis of katta or bag. Dr Kuldip Tanwar, president, Himachal Kisan Sabha, and its secretary Rakesh Singha said the support price had added insult to injury of the farmers as the state Cabinet okayed a hike of 50 paise yesterday. If the criterion of cost of production per kg was calculated and farmers had to earn some profit, then the minimum cost should be Rs 12 per kg, they asserted. The support price issue has sparked a debate on social media with the farmers pointing out that the purpose of MIS is to protect farmers’ interest and prevent markets from crashing during the peak apple season. “The criterion for revision of rates should have been calculated on the basis of increase in the cost of production,” commented a farmer. Also, the MIS procurement agencies such as the HPMC do not pay the farmers in cash after their fruit is procured. Instead the agencies give the agro-based inputs, which are not of good quality."
Assessing the RISK factor,"CAREER COMPASS: CREDIT ANALYST

Amit Goyal

A credit analyst mainly focuses on analysing the financial data of the customer, companies that are applying for credit or loans to determine the risk that the bank or other lending or credit-granting institution can face on the funds loaned. A credit analyst's job involves being accountable for assessing the applications of loan applicants using a range of criteria, including the purpose of the application, credit viability, customer payment history and customer creditworthiness. Credit analyst plays the role of a major decision maker of customer credit; he deals with computer programmes to maintain the history of customer credit and keeps financial records up-to-date. Without the recommendation of a credit analyst the banks, insurers and company won't be able to extend the loan for business, home, cars and occasionally employee's payrolls as well.He works with banks and other lenders to determine the ability of businesses to repay loans and other debts. Commercial credit analysts are usually employed by government authorised agencies, banks and commercial lenders.

Getting in

For getting into this field one would require a bachelor's degree in finance, accounting or another related field like ratio analysis, statistics, economics, calculus, financial statement analysis and risk assessment. These subjects are necessary to function as a credit analyst as they aid in risk assessment. Subjects like industry and ratio analysis are necessary because assessing the risk for a company includes assessing its environment. One can also go for a post graduate diploma in banking and finance to get professional and practical knowledge of these sectors.

Job description

Credit analysts start their career as junior analytics after getting a degree in accounting, finance or another related business field. Credit analysts can work in a variety of fields and locations. Many works for lending institutions like banks or insurance companies. Additionally, there is great demand in investment, working for an asset manager or private equity firm as a bond analyst or for rating agencies like Moody's or Standard & Poors, determining the risks of investing in a company or country. Some of the positions deal with consumer credit evaluation, overseeing analytical departments etc. In some firms, senior analysts oversee a team handling analysis for a particular market, region or industry. Top-performing analysts can rise to financial management positions overseeing analytical departments, making final credit decisions and monitoring departmental performance.

Remuneration

Credit analyst must be able to handle high level of responsibilities in their job.

Ability to look at or create a set of numbers and be able to know what they mean for each particular client.

Ability to effectively disseminate decisions to a variety of people, either orally or in print. Coming up with a solution to a problem is of little use if you can't communicate it to others effectively.

Ability to multitask. A credit analyst needs to handle different projects at the same time and prioritise projects effectively because the organisation might assign him several projects at the same time.

A credit analyst should have the basic knowledge of different software like Microsoft Excel etc to analyse numerical data.

He/she must have fluency in English and strong oral and written communication skills.

The plethora of opportunities is reflected in the salary range that credit analysts receive. The annual salary for credit analysts ranges between Rs 5 to 8 lakh and depends on the level of experience, type of industry and geographic location."
Be on course to make a difference,"FIELD IN FOCUS: ENVIRONMENTAL CAREERS

Usha Albuquerque

With the US and President Trump pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord, a gigantic chunk of the Antarctic peninsula breaking off, and global warming causing heat waves, droughts and floods across the world, there is discernable concern about the future of our existence. Over the past fifty years we have learnt with dismay that much of the development we need for human progress, mainly in industry and agriculture, takes a major toll of nature and the environment. Climate change, acid deposition and hazardous waste disposal has forced the world to take a closer look at how we interact with our environment. This requires the creation of a large pool of professionals who possess the skill-set to limit the damage of industrialisation and development on the world’s endangered and increasingly fragile environment and to invent newer technologies that are less of a burden on natural resources and therefore, more sustainable in the long run. This has spurred the demand for scientists, researchers, engineers and policy makers and others with a firm grounding in theoretical and practical aspects of environmental studies and who understand the issues at hand and can help manage them. So, if you want to make a difference to the world we live in, you can also join the growing number of professionals committed to 'sustainable development'. Environmental problems are so complex and far reaching that many different careers related to the environment encompass the wide range of inter-disciplinary career fields.

These include :

Environment Science

An environmental scientist’s job is to utilise the knowledge of various principles and concepts of science, in order to protect and preserve environment. Environmental scientists conduct research studies in order to develop theories or methods of abating and controlling the sources of environmental pollution. Most of these disciplines require a background in science. While there are very few undergraduate courses in environment sciences, those interested in the scientific research aspect of work in this field can take up Environmental Science as an MSc. programme after a bachelor’s degree in any discipline of science. Most environment scientists work with NGOs, government and private organisations and international agencies.

Environmental Research

Environment-related research includes fields such as ecology, zoology, botany, fisheries, forestry, and wildlife management. It may involve testing the effects of chemicals or pollutants on organisms in a laboratory, or in the field studying the ecology of plants and animals. An Environmental researcher requires a post-graduate degree in environmental science, biology, zoology, botany, life sciences, or related fields. There is scope for employment in academic institutions, government agencies, non-government organisations, or industries handling environment related products.

Environment / Resource Management

The study of how people interact with the environment and its influence on the environment requires not only an understanding of science and technology, but also economics and even sociology. Currently, most companies have set up environmental monitoring cells (EMCs) to conduct assessments on a number of fronts, ranging from town, water, sound, displacement of people to damage done by blasting, construction etc, and so require a team of qualified environment scientists, and social scientists, to safeguard their interests and promote business activities. Government and environment management organisations also require policy makers and administrators to handle the various aspects of protection and conservation. There are a number of courses in environment management including MA/ MSc in Environmental Studies, Natural Resources Management and Public Policy and sustainable development.

Environment engineers

Environment engineers study waste management of hazardous substances in order to analyse the risk, the treatment and the methods of containing such hazards. They also handle solid waste management, treatment and disposal of effluents, radiation protection and draft out regulations so as to prevent the occurrence of mishaps. Municipal water supply systems and industrial wastewater treatment systems are both designed by environmental engineers. They are also in charge of conducting research on proposed projects for the benefit of the environment, analyzing scientific data, and performing quality control checks. Today it is mandatory for all developmental projects to have an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Management plan (EMP) conducted by environment engineers before implementation. Many institutes in India offer graduate and post-graduate courses in environmental engineering. Most environment engineers work with Central and State Government pollution control boards, municipality corporations, water supply boards, public sector industries and with firms that provide professional, scientific, and technical services. International firms related to environmental projects are also recruiting environment engineers offering lucrative pay packages.

Environmental Journalism & advocacy

Much of the work in the management of environment issues involves creating awareness of the hazards of environmental pollution and the developing strategies for conservation and implementation. Whether it is researching on water, air pollution, livelihood and industry related issues, or reporting on the environment, or disseminating information through film or print, the field of the environment requires skills in writing, speaking, research, analysis, teaching, training, negotiating and persuading. This is best handled by those adept at communication and involves environmental journalism, or corporate communications. There are no specialised courses for environmental journalism, but those studying mass communication, journalism, public relations or corporate communications can specialize in this field. Apart from mainstream media such as newspapers and TV, environmental journalists can work for public relations or science communication, as well as with NGOs and international organizations working in the field of awareness and environmental protection.

Environmental Law

Environmental law deals with legislation concerned with protecting the environment and preventing degradation of natural resources. Environmental law also covers conservation of wildlife, protection of national parks and sanctuaries, and prohibiting or regulating damaging activities, assigning liability for environmental harms and providing adequate incentives for benign environmental activities. Environmental lawyers are employed in governmental agencies and non-governmental organisations. Industrial establishments also require environmental lawyers to help them deal with legal and governmental procedures related to the environment. There are LLM and PG diploma courses in Environmental law.

Reform in University Life,"LAHORE, TUESDAY, AUGUST 7, 1917

THOUGH Oxford and Cambridge have served as models to most of the later Universities started in England and India, yet we see that the war ideals and consequent change in outlook require marked reforms in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. To people in India these reforms are important in a special degree because they tend to do away with the rigidity of life and the cost of education, introducing general simplicity. A correspondent discusses the future of Oxford and points out that owing to compulsory service, the flow of matriculates to Oxford is almost entirely confined at present to Indians and a few colonials and foreigners."

Thumb rules for investment,"Anil Chopra

Every individual is unique and has different financial goals, risk-taking appetite and attitude towards saving/investment. However, there are certain fundamental principles of investing which are universally applicable to “one and all”. These principles are also referred as “Thumb Rules” in general parlance. We are sharing below certain thumb rules which must be kept in mind before making investment/financial decisions.Your monthly savings must be at least 30% of your take home salary/income. Take home salary is computed as net salary after statutory deductions like provident fund and TDS etc. For example, if your gross monthly income is Rs 1 lakh and your take home salary after tax/PF is Rs 70,000 then you must save at least Rs 21,000 every month for investing in your medium to long term goals.

Savings account

Not more than two times of your monthly household budget expenses. If your household expenses budget is Rs 50,000 pm, you should not keep more than Rs 1 lakh balance in your savings account. Please remember that generally savings bank accounts earn interest @ 4% pa and that is not enough even to beat inflation.

Investment in gold

Ideal allocation to gold is around 10% of your financial portfolio. Financial portfolio includes bank balance, fixed deposits, post office schemes, mutual funds, bonds, shares and stocks etc. Accordingly, if your financial portfolio (without adding the value of house) is Rs 1 crore, maximum exposure to gold including Gold Mutual Fund or Gold ETF should be Rs 10 lakh. If your investment in gold is less than 10% of your financial portfolio, you may invest in Gold ETF or Gold Mutual Funds rather than buying physical gold which carries risk of being stolen. On the other hand, if your current investment is higher than 10% of your financial portfolio, then at least do not make any fresh investment in gold until your financial portfolio grows and exposure to gold comes down to around 10%.

Allocation to equity

Thumb rule for investing in equity is “100 minus your age” should be the allocation to equity. For example, if your age is 30 years, you may invest up to 70% (100 – 30) of your savings into equity through Equity Mutual Fund Schemes of reputed Asset Management Companies. Similarly, if your current age is 60 years, you should not invest more than 40% (100–60) of your savings in equity-oriented schemes. As your age continues to grow, you should reduce your exposure to equity.

Debt schemes

As already mentioned, around 10% should be invested in gold, 100 minus your age should be invested in equity and balance should be invested in debt schemes like PPF, debt mutual funds, FMP, bonds, bank deposits etc. For example, if your current age is 50 years then you should invest 50% in equity (100–50), 10% in gold and balance 40% in various debt instruments.

Life insurance coverage

The thumb rule for life insurance coverage amount is at least seven times of your annual income. If your annual salary package is Rs 15 lakh, you must have “sum assured” of at least Rs 1 crore in one or more life insurance plans, including term plan, ULIPs and traditional plans.

Health insurance

For single individual, with no dependents, health insurance coverage of Rs 2 lakh is enough. However, for any couple with or without kids, health insurance coverage should be for minimum Rs 5 lakh and if your old parents are also alive and dependent on you then you must take a family floater plan of Rs 10 lakh.

Mutual funds

If your monthly savings is Rs 10,000, you must have minimum two SIPs of Rs 5,000 each. One in large cap and another mid cap. If your monthly savings is Rs 25,000, you should have five SIPs of Rs 5,000 each out of which two should be large cap, one mid cap, one flexi cap and the last one can be in sectoral SIP like banking or infrastructure etc.

Portfolio review

The thumb rule for reviewing the portfolio is once every three months if your portfolio is larger than Rs 50 lakh and at least twice a year if your portfolio is less than Rs 50 lakh. Above thumb rules are shared for reference purpose only and to ensure that you should not go “off course” in your journey of wealth creation and achievement of your financial goals. You must consult a certified financial planner or a subject matter expert for taking important financial decisions. The writer is Group Director, Bajaj Capital.

Marriott India to have 100 hotels by next year,"Panaji, August 7

American hospitality group Marriott International Inc will have 100 operational hotels in the country by 2018, a top executive has said. The world’s largest hotel chain which began its operations in the country in 1997 with a project in Goa, currently has 86 hotels and 15 brands spanning 35 cities. “Marriott International has 86 hotels in the country and we are the biggest hotel company in the world. We have so far opened four hotels in the country this year and will open six more during the year,” Marriott International South Asia president Neeraj Govil told PTI during opening of Le Meridian at Calangute in the coastal state. He said they were looking at tertiary cities like Indore, Amritsar, Coimbatore, Jaipur and others for more properties. “We will hit our hundred in 2018. We also have another 100 hotels in the pipeline, so we are looking at opening somewhere between 15 and 20 hotels a year in the country every year over the next five years,” Govil said. He said the tourism growth had been very strong due to the measures introduced by the government which had made the destinations more people-friendly. “One of the pillars of growth, as projected by the government is tourism. The government is also very proactive in infrastructure development which helps bring in a lot more people.” Marriott as a company, he said, is targeting all the customers, be it leisure or groups. “Most importantly, we’ve turned our focus towards domestic consumers. Because we’ve 15 brands we play at various price points. We don’t get into the market from pricing perspective. We try to win the customers.” The hotel chain nets 75 per cent of its business from domestic consumers. The company, a couple of weeks ago, launched an initiative called ‘Shadi by Marriott’, a wedding-focused campaign. “It’s a big signal that consumer here is the consumer of today and the future,” he said. It is looking at different kinds of weddings, including overseas, seven-star, five-star, beach wedding, destination wedding and others. “We have 86 hotels and 15 brands, so there is a brand for every segment. Annual growth is high double-digit. Since the time we have been here, we’ve been growing above the market and also growing our market share,” Govil said. PTI"

Five unidentified militants were killed in a gunfight as Army on Monday claimed to have foiled a major infiltration bid in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district.

Army said the infiltration bid was foiled along the Line of Control in Machil sector, when militants were trying to sneak into valley.

“The group was challenged and they opened fire triggering a gunfight. So far five terrorists have been eliminated and five weapons recovered,” Srinagar-based defence spokesman, Col Rajesh Kalia said.

He said combing operation is the thick forest was still underway. In a separate incident of ceasefire violation by Pakistan, an army jawan was injured in Uri in north Kashmir. Meanwhile, a Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) militant from Pakistan was killed in south Kashmir’s Pampore in a gunfight late on Sunday, the police said. The gunfight erupted at Samboora Pampore, some 17 km from Srinagar, when joint teams of the police, Army and CRPF launched an anti-militancy operation after an input about militant presence. “As the joint team intensified the search operation, the militants opened fire, triggering a gunfight. In the encounter, a militant was killed,” a police officer said. One AK-47 rifle was recovered from the encounter site. A police spokesman identified the slain militant as Umer of the Abu Ismail group of the Pakistan-based Lashkar. “The role of Umer in different crimes committed by the Abu Ismail group is being ascertained,” the spokesman said. There were also reports of stone pelting in the area when the gunfight broke late on Sunday."
Row over Google employee’s defence of tech gender gap,"New York, August 7

Google found itself at the center of controversy after an employee in a leaked internal document claimed “biological causes” explained the lack of women in tech industry leadership roles.

The screed—dubbed “sexist” by US media—revived the simmering debate over a culture of sexism and lack of diversity in tech sectors.

“I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership,” read the 3,000-word fulmination by an anonymous male software engineer.

According to the author, natural aptitudes of men allow them to become better computer programmers. Women, he said, have more “openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas”—meaning they “prefer jobs in social or artistic areas.”

In response to the leaked memo, Danielle Brown, Google’s new vice president of diversity, told employees in an email that “it’s not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages”.

“Changing a culture is hard, and it’s often uncomfortable,” she said.

Brown added, however, that “part of building an open, inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views, including different political views, feel safe sharing their opinions.”

The controversy comes as increasing numbers of women are going public with complaints of gender-based discrimination in Silicon Valley.

Uber’s embattled chief executive Travis Kalanick resigned earlier this year under pressure from investors seeking to clean up the company’s allegedly toxic corporate culture.

His departure capped a rocky period for the global ridesharing giant, which has been roiled by disturbing reports of cutthroat workplace conditions, harassment and discrimination. — AFP"
"The Tribune: Jalandhar City, Jalandhar Cantt news","JALANDHAR: The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has made many residents of the city upset as the rates of many traditional Indian “mithais” and chocolates have gone up.

Avneet Kaur

Jalandhar, August 6

The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has made many residents of the city upset as the rates of many traditional Indian “mithais” and chocolates have gone up. The delicious sweets and chocolates as well as chocolate-made “mithais” are reported to be consumed less during the Rakhi festival. There is a 5 per cent tax applicable on plain “rasmalai”, but one has to pay 18 per cent tax on buying “kesar rasmalai”. Moreover, the plain “barfi”, which cost between Rs 250 and Rs 300 earlier, is taxed at 5 per cent and now costs between Rs 300 and Rs 350. Customer at a “mithai” shop said, “Kaju or pista barfi attracts 18 per cent tax as shopkeepers are fixing the GST according to the rate of dry fruit and ingredients used. Some are even charging 20 per cent GST for silver-coated mithai.”

The traditional sweets, as informed by shopkeepers, are attracting a 5 per cent GST, while chocolates are being taxed at the rate of 28 per cent. Although the government had recently clarified that the rate of tax on chocolate-made “mithai” will be the same as “mithai”, the complexity over the new tax regime still prevails in the market. Even the government also stated that the GST will be levied on the main product and not on ingredients. Still, bewildered shopkeepers are charging tax at different rates on the same product.

Inderjit Singh, a customer at a local sweet shop, said, “Earlier, “mithai” was tax-free, but now it attracts 5 per cent tax. The sweets and “mithais” which are enjoyed by every class should not be taxed. Giving sweets to each other on happy occasions and on festivals is a tradition which has been observed in India for decades. With the imposition of the 5 per cent tax, the government has only spoiled our festive mood.”

In fact, the same response was received from many other residents who said, “This time it’s better to gift relatives biscuits and cakes as even shopkeepers are not clear about the new tax on the chocolate-made “mithai”, so they are charging 28 per cent GST on chocolate burfi or and special chocolate rolls.”

Even tax is being levied on snacks like “samosa”, which was available at Rs 10. It now costs Rs 12. We do not understand what the government would achieve by taxing eatables,” he added."
Draped in past & present,"Designers Shyamal & Bhumika, who debuted at FDCI’s India Couture Week, share their creative canvas

Swati Rai

When couture took over the ramp in the Capital recently, one label had to leave a mark. This season was Shyamal & Bhumika’s first at FDCI’s India Couture Week. A drift from the usual cheer at the event, they brought in muted colours. Champagne gold, ruby red, emerald green, coral blue and crimson swayed the ramp. Moving away from traditional flavour, their designs were contemporary this time. And well, it turned a glamorous affair.

The Gujarat-based couple established the brand in 2003. Across the years, it has come to know for their designs that seek inspiration in the rich Indian heritage and history. The two use precious crafts and techniques of the country to create couture collections relevant to modern-day sensibilities.

Bhumika’s passion for textiles and fashion led her to study fashion design at the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) whereas Shyamal researched fashion in Milan and London. This disparate design training and fashion exposure honed their design sensibility. “It gave me a completely different perspective and helped add an international view point of fashion to our work. It led to the birth of what we call our global line, which is designed by keeping in mind the current global influences, trends and a very modern aesthetic,” says Shyamal.

Architectural grandeurs of their ancestral homes to personal travels and tales that they grew up listening to, all find expression in their mood boards, sketches and, finally, the ramp. Their sartorial map remains faithful to its vision of ‘India to the World’, their tagline. They use fashion as a medium to connect global audiences through the rich and glorious crafts and artisan techniques of India.

But there is a question that bothers us again and again: Is it not a disadvantage to live away from the fashion hubs of India? Shaymal says that from marketing and networking point of view, it might not be a good idea to stay in Gujarat. However, he feels this distance gives them as “an opportunity to be away from commercial pressures and influences and work in peace.”

“Also, when you are away, your roots and influences are different and your collections look unique. However, we do have a store in Mumbai and retail points in Delhi. So, we are very accessible to everyone. The constraint of not being in the fashion capital helped us adopt social media early on and led us to being one of the most followed south Asian designers on Facebook,” he smiles.

The Princess’ Soiree, the collection showcased at ICW, is an extension of the common thread binding their collections form the past — that of a grand and royal, yet contemporary lexicon. With this, they carry forward their earlier collections like The Royal Procession, Shaahi Baug, etc.

The Princess’s Soiree centres around a well-heeled and well-travelled woman of the present with roots in the past. The story is about her travels from India to Europe and back and her various inspirations en route. The new collection draws from the ancestral stories of their family from the late 1800s. But, it also features European details, Victorian inspirations and Baroque decorations amalgamated with rich Indian heritage. So, what you see on the ramp are floor sweeping gowns, sheer tulle capes, ruffled blouses, supple frills, belted waists, kalidaar jackets and lehengas. Fluid beadwork, dripping gold embroidery in floral setting and luscious gold thread work is immaculately incorporated. The cascading ruffles sprinkled with glitter, twirling tulle skirts and magnanimous gowns with winding floral thread work transcend you to a fantasy like ambience.

Amidst all this experimentation, one mulls if at a time when plus size fashion and ageless fashion is taking over sartorial discussions, do they see their collection breaking stereotypes… Shyamal and Bhumika say, “Style is more important than just blindly aping fashion trends.” No wonder then that their team is trained to customise couture for a global clientele with very specific requests and multiple size specifications, suiting different age groups as well as altering the outfit to meet different religious customs.

The designers also intend taking the crafts of India to a global clientele. “We have been successful in doing it over the internet and the next step would naturally be a network of international retail points to cater to this global following,” says Bhumika. In the near future, they swear to breaking away from the conventional and inch towards pastels such as forest green or English green, shades of red, intricate handwork and a subtle play of sheer. Take the hint."

Gitanjali Sharma

The Tricolour. That’s the first sight that awaits a visitor stepping out of the Srinagar airport. Riding high on a tall mast on the airport lawns, it somewhat dwarfs the images of the green and black flags raised at pro-freedom protests. It’s a rather comforting thought, despite the promise to keep behind all preconceptions on this four-day journey to experience the Valley in its various shades.

Day 1 (Friday), Dateline: Srinagar

Minutes later, moving towards the city, the taxi driver, a local, expectedly veered the conversation around violence, the innumerable restrictions and outsiders’ apprehensions — real and imaginary. The traffic was bare minimum, courtesy the Friday factor. Zipping along the Jhelum, the driver finally applied brakes to his chatter at the hotel resting near the river, with the trailing thought: peace through dialogue remains the destination of most Kashmiris. The wait is on.

The shades of this wait were only too visible at the Dal Lake, its placidness donning a sombre shroud with few appreciators in sight. Asif Khan, one of the many shikarawallahs wistfully awaiting customers, blamed the blankness around to the recent attack on Amarnath pilgrims. When probed a little further, he vent out his anger on the government that was “doing nothing to resolve the Kashmir issue”. The wait for tourists, aman and azadi continues, he said, creating ripples in the still waters.

Postscript: Just five occupants at the hotel. A tip brought in three lovely roses from its lush garden to the room.

Day 2, Dateline: Central Kashmir

The ubiquitous wait wears a uniformed look for the soldiers tackling militants, both local and Pakistan nationals.

The run from Srinagar to Zojila passes through the heavily fortified central Kashmir towns of Ganderbal and Sonmarg. As the Amarnath yatris take this route to the Baltal camp, armed soldiers, alert to untowardness of any kind, can be seen stationed a few metres apart. Keeping endless vigil, they too appear to be players, howsoever different, in the waiting game.

“The security forces can keep the situation under control up to a certain level but beyond that the political set-up has to take over,” a top Army officer in the region summed up the lingering Kashmir crisis.

Despite the threat to even the seasonal multicultural plurality, the yatris’ enthusiasm has shown no dip. The fervour was evident too at the Pahalgam base camp in south Kashmir, which was toured the next day. The separatists may keep making loud proclamations about “Kashmiri hospitality” for “our yatri guests” but equally loud remain their frequent calls for shutdowns and “freedom”.

Postscript: Got little time to sit and stare on the Sonmarg meadows that are being overwhelmed by the surrounding construction activity.

Day 3, Dateline: South Kashmir

“I am confused. I want peace but I don’t know how it will come about. I have no faith in any of the mainstream parties. Yes, I am drawn towards the new militants surfacing on the social media. At least, they promise freedom…I live on that hope.” This outburst of a dryfruit-seller in Pampore reflects the angst of many Kashmiris and their disillusionment with political leaders. The outrage against the PDP, particularly for aligning with the rightist BJP, in its south Kashmir bastion is all too palpable.

PDP vice-president and Chief Minister’s Mehbooba Mufti’s uncle Sartaj Madni, who is one of the prime movers in the government, admitted some people were upset with their party but expressed confidence that they would come around. Hopeful of a dialogue, he placed implicit faith in the Central Government for resolving the Kashmir issue. The wait for the Modi government to take the initiative to understand and settle the Kashmir crisis hasn’t died, though some of the optimism has surely waned in the last three years.

In contrast, Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh has ruled out the possibility of a dialogue during the present situation. “The time is not conducive for talks,” he put it categorically, alluding to the unending violence.

This stance, however, doesn’t go down well with the majority in Kashmir who have been long waiting for a discourse. Prof Noor Ahmad Baba, a political expert, is of the view that Kashmir has gone restive waiting for the Central Government to at least acknowledge the problem as it exists. The signs of violence and terror in south Kashmir, the hub of militancy, are starkly visible along the Pampore-Pahalgam stretch. Just metres away from the highway at Pampore in Pulwama district stand the burnt and damaged Entrepreneurship Development Institute buildings that came under fidayeen attack twice over. A little ahead in Anantnag, comes the point where the pilgrim bus came under militant fire.

Crossing the vulnerable highway in south Kashmir, a thought creeps along: will the wait for peace remain just that. A wait. The disheartening thought, however, evaporates the minute you meet Amarnath yatra pilgrims at Pahalgam, the longer but less excruciating route to the shrine. Their enthusiasm and that of the hospitable locals around, allows faith to make way for hope again… hope for some resolution to this conflict.

The SSP at Anantnag, Altaf Khan, a counter-insurgency specialist, appeared confident about the militant count dipping significantly over the next six months. However, gullible youth turning to flashy new-age militants occupying the social media still remained a concern, he admitted while regretting the disappearance of the multi-cultural society from Kashmir. “I had 85 per cent Pandits in my class in Srinagar. The new generation hasn’t seen this plurality. Having grown up seeing only violence and mistrust, they know little of Kashmiriyat,” he asserts.

The Centre’s indecisiveness to boldly tackle the crisis, too, draws flak from some quarters. Another top cop from the region declared that the Modi government must take a decision, even if it is to bring the state fully under its control.

Postscript: The nun chai (salty tea) and flattened buns at a roadside bakery both freshened the mind and spirit.

Day 4, Dateline: North Kashmir

It was an exhilarating four-hour stretch from Srinagar to Aman Setu, the peace bridge connecting Uri with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Passing through Baramulla, the Jhelum snaked along one side and apple orchards dotted the green cover on the other.

At Aman Setu, the peace bus arrived with passengers, some returning to this side and others visiting from across the LoC. One thing they all had in common: a satiated look that comes with fulfilment of some kind. Grateful for this exchange, they gushed over the need for peace.

This wait continues, more so for the real stakeholders on the sidelines — the student who wants to attend school without fear, the soldier who hasn’t got leave to be home with his family, and the shikarawallah who wants to wind up the day with at least Rs 500 in his pocket.

Minutes after the arrival of the peace bus came the flash about shelling near Aman Setu. News from the Rajouri area had already come earlier in the day of a soldier and a six-year-old girl succumbing to heavy Pakistan shelling.

Heading back through a vulnerable area, the mind was blank, there was no room for fear or anxiety. All that it carried with it was the burden of the lives gone and the lives still struggling as the conflict and the wait lives on.

Postscript: On the return flight, a Kashmiri Pandit was sceptical about resolving the Kashmir crisis through dialogue. Minutes later, however, she said resignedly: “Probably, that’s the only way out.”"
Tidings from Doklam,"M. K. Bhadrakumar

A political decision to project military power

M. K. Bhadrakumar

IF you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately. So I think it’s a cost-benefit ratio.” These are words by James Mattis, US Secretary of Defence. It is a powerful statement about the no-man’s land where diplomacy and military power intersect in a country's foreign policy. The point is, it is never easy to judge the measured activism with which military power is used in support of foreign policy. The preference for hard power may have seductive appeal — and diplomacy may look an elusive idea — but, historically, it is not without containing some irony. Bismarck’s “blood and iron” didn’t turn out to be the solution to the German question. It led instead to the ruin of Germany. Suffice to say, the so-called Doklam standoff with China conveys a stark and disturbing message. The government had a choice to resort to diplomacy or use military force. It chose the latter. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, “China had notified the Indian side in advance out of goodwill… on May 18 and June 8 respectively and the Indian side didn't make any response."" Instead, when the Chinese began building the road on June 16, within forty-eight hours Indian troops intervened to stop the work. From all appearances, India didn't blunder into the standoff. It was a political decision to project military power across the international border. The Indian troops simply crossed the Sikkim-China boundary to get across to the Bhutan-China border. Delhi claims that it is safeguarding Bhutan's interests. Bhutan has not endorsed the Indian intervention publicly, but that causes no embarrassment to Delhi. The Indian commentators laud the government for showing exemplary restraint in the face of strident Chinese statements. But in reality the government owes no explanation to anyone for its action. The nearest analogy would be the “surgical strikes” against Pakistan — an unapologetic display of ""muscular diplomacy”. Prime Minister Modi’s remarks on June 26 in Washington during his visit to the US regarding the “surgical strikes” put things in perspective. He said no country in the world questioned India's action. Thereupon, he went on to say that India, while following international laws and norms, is also capable of taking “the toughest of steps for our sovereignty, security, peace, our people, and progress. Whenever the need arises we have done it and the world will never be able to stop us.” When he said this, Modi had known — although we hadn't at that point in time — that the Indian forces had crossed the international border into Doklam, and there was a standoff, which was already into the second week. Therefore, it is futile to measure the standoff with coffee spoons on a daily basis in terms of a mutual “Doklam thaw”. Perhaps, the most significant remark that External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj made in her speech in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday was that the Doklam standoff is not a stand-alone issue. The minister was quoted as saying, “We are not negotiating only on Doklam, we are talking about bilateral relations in entirety. And a solution will also emerge from it.” Clearly, our pundits have let their imagination run berserk by analysing the Doklam standoff in terms of India “calling the Chinese bluff”; India “standing up to China’s bullying”; or India “giving China a bloody nose.” Such puerile thesis misses the point that this is a profoundly serious standoff, which India got into with great deliberation, stemming from a hugely consequential political decision. The Chinese statements have duly assessed that India did not blunder into this standoff, but acted with a purpose. What objective(s) would the government have had? Conceivably, there are four dimensions. One, Delhi would have hoped to send a message to Beijing on the lines Modi spoke in Washington - and, that he spoke from American soil carried its own resonance. Two, India hoped to bring forward from the backburner the issue of the “trijunction” where the borders of Sikkim, Bhutan and China meet. There are differences in interpretation, which have security implications. Three, succinctly put, India regarded itself to be a stakeholder in the China-Bhutan border negotiations and assertively sought a say in the two countries’ discourse. Four, importantly, India hoped that the Doklam standoff would lead to an enhanced strategic communication regarding each side’s core interests and vital concerns. However, the border issue also devolves upon the fact that there has been no consultation since the Special Representatives in December 2012 agreed on the so-called Common Understanding to the effect that “There is mutual agreement on the basis of the alignment of the India-China boundary in the Sikkim sector as provided by the convention between China and Great Britain relating to Tibet and Sikkim signed in 1890.” India hopes to negotiate from a position of strategic advantage insofar as its military presence in Sikkim is discernibly superior to China's on its side of the border — and India’s “muscular diplomacy” over Doklam testified to it. Basically, India keeps an ambivalent stance with regard to the 1890 treaty — neither disavowing it nor acknowledging the delimitation of the India-China border in the Sikkim sector as established in the treaty, which China keeps emphasising as sacrosanct. How far India’s “muscular diplomacy” impressed the Chinese will only be known in the fullness of time. A partial Indian drawdown may have taken place, but China sticks to its unequivocal stance that there is no room for negotiation so long as Indian troops remained in Doklam. The chances of China retreating from this red line appear remote. There are facile assumptions being voiced that India can leverage China’s interest in the Indian market. But then, China’s exposure in the Indian market is miniscule in comparison with its profound interdependency vis-à-vis the United States — and yet Beijing asserts its core interests in the South China Sea. An $11.2 trillion economy with $3685 billion foreign trade (2016 figures) does not critically depend on the Indian market where China's cumulative FDI flow is a paltry $1.63 billion and trade turnover stands at $71.48 billion. A Xinhua commentary on Friday (the day after Sushma Swaraj spoke in Parliament) all but ruled out any “face-saving” formula. It hinted at Beijing’s grit to blunt India’s “muscular diplomacy”, lest it became precedent-setting in future. Equally, Beijing intends to pursue its future relations with Bhutan as a truly sovereign, independent state and seems confident that Thimpu shares this interest. All in all, September could be the month to watch — unless there is a complete Indian withdrawal by then. Meanwhile, storm clouds are gathering."
Filing for motor insurance claim? Think twice,"Neeraj Gupta

People buy motor insurance mainly for two reasons — first and foremost, to protect their vehicle against any damage caused by an accident and secondly, because it is mandatory by law. Out of millions of accidents which happen on Indian roads annually, the vast majority of them are not fatal and claims for such accidents are called petty claims, where claim amount is less than the premium. While most of us prefer filing a claim immediately after an accident, we often face a dilemma on whether or not we should be filing a claim for smaller damages such as scratch or dent. So, should you file a claim every time? Here are a few pointers to consider before filing a claim from your insurer:

Do calculation

It is crucial for you to measure your claim amount against deductibles, depreciation and NCB benefits, and decide which one will be beneficial in the long run. Your motor insurance plan comes with a deductible clause that makes you equally responsible for paying some percentage of the total claim amount from your own pocket. This could be anywhere between 10%-20% of total repair cost, depending upon the size of the engine of your car. An inbuilt deductible is called as compulsory deductible and the amount is fixed Rs 1,000 up to 1500cc and Rs 2,000 above 1500cc. For instance, you have a comprehensive insurance plan without add-ons for a three-year-old car and you apply for a claim of Rs 10,000 to get the repairs done. In this case, you may have to pay somewhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000 as deductibles and depreciation cost. Your insurer, on the other hand, would pay the rest of money that is Rs 4,000-5,000. So, if you were to make a claim here, you would undergo loss; knowing that you will have to let go 25% NCB and also pay for repairing from your own pocket.

No claim bonus

Apart from this, filing a claim impacts your claim history and creates a perception about your profile in the mind of insurance companies. In simple words, no claim bonus is a report card of your driving abilities. In India, there is no mechanism to calculate your driving skills; therefore, insurance companies rely on NCB. Maintained NCB simply means you have not made any claim in past years and hence you are a safe driver.

Dilemma

Scenario 1: Hitting someone else’s car or property. You should claim insurance if the damage is considerable. However, if the damage to the third-person’s property is minor and no one got hurt, then the best thing to do is to get the repairs done on your own. That way, you will escape from the hassle of long, time-consuming paperwork for a small amount. Scenario 2: Damage is going to cost Rs 15,000 or less. A big NO. Do not claim insurance for such a small amount. Settle it from your own pocket and save the insurance for worse days. However, you can claim benefits, if you own a new car with 0% NCB and zero depreciation add-on. Scenario 3: If the car is too old and you’re planning to purchase a new one anytime soon. Ever heard that you can transfer no claim bonus points to your new car and new insurance? It will be helpful not to dump the NCB benefits over a minor claim and, instead, use them to effectively lower your new insurance premium amount. In any case, you have to sell off the old car. Scenario 4: You have already made a claim this year. The number of claims you can make in a year are limited. As far as zero depreciation is concerned, it is limited to two claims per year, after two claims your plan will be handled as vanilla comprehensive policy, so must save it for an even worse scenario. Making a claim every time may look like a good thing to do for a short-term profit, but in the long term, you will face a bigger loss in terms of no NCB. Moreover, a lot of claims will make your driving history look too dangerous and you may have to pay a higher premium next time you buy an insurance policy. Hence, paying for small repairs from your own pocket will keep you in a win-win situation. The writer is Head of Motor Insurance, Policybazaar.com. The views expressed in this article are his own"

Every individual is unique and has different financial goals, risk-taking appetite and attitude towards saving/investment.

[ + read story ]

Anil Chopra

Every individual is unique and has different financial goals, risk-taking appetite and attitude towards saving/investment. However, there are certain fundamental principles of investing which are universally applicable to “one and all”. These principles are also referred as “Thumb Rules” in general parlance.

We are sharing below certain thumb rules which must be kept in mind before making investment/financial decisions.

How much should YOU save

Your monthly savings must be at least 30% of your take home salary/income. Take home salary is computed as net salary after statutory deductions like provident fund and TDS etc. For example, if your gross monthly income is Rs 1 lakh and your take home salary after tax/PF is Rs 70,000 then you must save at least Rs 21,000 every month for investing in your medium to long term goals.

Savings account

Not more than two times of your monthly household budget expenses. If your household expenses budget is Rs 50,000 pm, you should not keep more than Rs 1 lakh balance in your savings account. Please remember that generally savings bank accounts earn interest @ 4% pa and that is not enough even to beat inflation.

Investment in gold

Ideal allocation to gold is around 10% of your financial portfolio.

Financial portfolio includes bank balance, fixed deposits, post office schemes, mutual funds, bonds, shares and stocks etc.

Accordingly, if your financial portfolio (without adding the value of house) is Rs 1 crore, maximum exposure to gold including Gold Mutual Fund or Gold ETF should be Rs 10 lakh. If your investment in gold is less than 10% of your financial portfolio, you may invest in Gold ETF or Gold Mutual Funds rather than buying physical gold which carries risk of being stolen. On the other hand, if your current investment is higher than 10% of your financial portfolio, then at least do not make any fresh investment in gold until your financial portfolio grows and exposure to gold comes down to around 10%.

Allocation to equity

Thumb rule for investing in equity is “100 minus your age” should be the allocation to equity. For example, if your age is 30 years, you may invest up to 70% (100 – 30) of your savings into equity through Equity Mutual Fund Schemes of reputed Asset Management Companies.

Similarly, if your current age is 60 years, you should not invest more than 40% (100–60) of your savings in equity-oriented schemes. As your age continues to grow, you should reduce your exposure to equity.

Debt schemes

As already mentioned, around 10% should be invested in gold, 100 minus your age should be invested in equity and balance should be invested in debt schemes like PPF, debt mutual funds, FMP, bonds, bank deposits etc. For example, if your current age is 50 years then you should invest 50% in equity (100–50), 10% in gold and balance 40% in various debt instruments.

Life insurance coverage

The thumb rule for life insurance coverage amount is at least seven times of your annual income. If your annual salary package is Rs 15 lakh, you must have “sum assured” of at least Rs 1 crore in one or more life insurance plans, including term plan, ULIPs and traditional plans.

Health insurance

For single individual, with no dependents, health insurance coverage of Rs 2 lakh is enough. However, for any couple with or without kids, health insurance coverage should be for minimum Rs 5 lakh and if your old parents are also alive and dependent on you then you must take a family floater plan of Rs 10 lakh.

Mutual funds

If your monthly savings is Rs 10,000, you must have minimum two SIPs of Rs 5,000 each. One in large cap and another mid cap. If your monthly savings is Rs 25,000, you should have five SIPs of Rs 5,000 each out of which two should be large cap, one mid cap, one flexi cap and the last one can be in sectoral SIP like banking or infrastructure etc.

Portfolio review

The thumb rule for reviewing the portfolio is once every three months if your portfolio is larger than Rs 50 lakh and at least twice a year if your portfolio is less than Rs 50 lakh.

Above thumb rules are shared for reference purpose only and to ensure that you should not go “off course” in your journey of wealth creation and achievement of your financial goals. You must consult a certified financial planner or a subject matter expert for taking important financial decisions.

Honourable Venkaiah Naidu,"Honourable Venkaiah Naidu

New custodian of Rajya Sabha role and autonomy

Also in this section

That familiar stink

AS expected, M Venkaiah Naidu prevailed over Gopalkrishna Gandhi in the vice-presidential election last Saturday. For the BJP-led NDA, the vice-presidential contest had become one more occasion to demonstrate its political dominance over the constitutional architecture; for the Congress-led Opposition, the election was an opportunity to reaffirm a set of democratic values and ideas. Naidu’s victory was a foregone conclusion, and he had, for good measure, a few extra cross-votes in his kitty. Seen in a larger context, Naidu’s accession to the vice-presidential gaddi demonstrates Indian democracy’s inclusive promise. His humble background was no obstacle to achievement of distinction, first within his party and now on a much bigger stage. He is the most prominent leader the BJP has promoted from “the South” over the years and his presence in the vice-presidential chair will be reassuring, at least symbolically, to fellow-Indians living below the Vindhyas. As Vice-President, Venkaiah Naidu will preside over the Rajya Sabha as its chairman. It is gratifying that after his victory he committed himself to “uphold the dignity of the House”. He takes over as Chairman at a time when there is a systematic attempt by the ruling party (of which he was a key member till the other day) to saw off the Upper House’s role and importance. The Upper House exists as a part of a deliberate and well-considered constitutional mechanism of checks and balances — balancing popular will against sober and responsible reflection, and, the Centre against the States. It will be now up to Venkaiah Naidu to try to roll back the onslaught on the Rajya Sabha. The Vice-President-designate has been a seasoned political activist, keeping afloat his party’s flag in a part of the country that was otherwise unenthusiastic about the saffron appeal and propaganda. His party has recognised and rewarded him for this perseverance. All his life Mr Naidu has lived under the shadow of another, taller leader; now he will be called upon to be his own man. A change of roles is not easy to come by; but, then, he will be taking an oath to “bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India”."

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 6

Investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the arrest of an HCS officer, posted as SDM (East), her husband and a middleman while allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 75,000, has revealed that the middleman had come in contact with the officer using links of higher officials. The role of one more officer in the SDM’s office, whose name has cropped up, will also be investigated by CBI sleuths.

All three accused were produced before the Duty Magistrate, who remanded the HCS officer and the middleman in one-day custody while the officer’s husband was sent to judicial custody.

The complainant in the case, Tarsem Kumar, had alleged that there was a property dispute between him and his brother and the matter was listed for hearing in the court of SDM (East) Shilpi Pattar. The property dispute was reportedly decided by the SDM on August 3, directing that the disputed property at the grain market in Sector 26 be sealed, without hearing the complainant. The property was sealed by the police the same day.

According to the CBI, the complainant discussed the case with GS Brar, who took him to the SDM’s office. It was also alleged that Brar told the complainant that the SDM would revoke her decision provided the complainant paid a bribe of Rs 5 lakh to her. The bribe amount was reduced to Rs 2 lakh.

The CBI laid a trap and caught Brar and the SDM while taking Rs 75,000 as the first instalment. SDM’s husband Dheeraj Dutt was also arrested as Rs 50,000 of the bribe money was recovered from him while Rs 25,000 was recovered from Brar. CBI sources said the SDM’s husband tried to hide the money in his undergarments.

Rs 2 lakh recovered from SDM’s house

A search conducted at the SDM’s house in Sector 27 led to the recovery of Rs 2 lakh, bank locker keys and documents pertaining to bank accounts.

Another officer under the scanner

Sources said during the probe, it came to light that Brar came in contact with the SDM by using links of higher officials, which had to be investigated. CBI sleuths will also question the officer whom the complainant was asked to meet by the SDM to get the work done.

SDM’s husband seen smiling

While SDM Shilpi Pattar had moist eyes, there was no sign of remorse on her husband’s face, who was seen smiling outside the Duty Magistrate’s house in Sector 19.

Over 30 cases pending in SDM’s court

More than 30 cases of violation and misuse of property are pending in the court of SDM (East) Shilpi Patter Dutt. SDMs have been delegated the powers of the Estate Officer by the UT to hear cases of violation of building bylaws. All buildings are covered under the Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulation) Act, 1952, implemented in the city. The Estate Officer first issues a notice to the owner if violation of building bylaws is found during checking. If the owner fails to remove the violations after the notice, the SDM can seal the building. The Estate Officer also has the power to de-seal the building ."

India set for record kharif crop harvest,"India set for record kharif crop harvest

New Delhi, August 6 Foodgrain output in the ongoing kharif season is likely to surpass last year’s record of 138.04 million tonnes due to higher acreage and good monsoon for the second straight year, Agriculture Secretary Shobhana K Pattanayak said today. So far, more than 80 per cent of the sowing of kharif crops — paddy, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane and jute — has been completed and the planting would continue in some parts till next month, Pattanayak said. About 19 lakh hectare of crop area has been affected by floods across the country and farmers are likely to take up other kharif crops once the water recedes, he said, expressing concern about poor rain in some parts of Karnataka. While there were floods in some states, there was a drought-like situation in parts of Karnataka, Pattanayak said, adding that there had still been close to 3 per cent jump in the acreage under kharif crops so far. Pattanayak said farmers in flood-hit areas would replant other crops in 19 lakh hectare once the water receded. Till last week, farmers had sown kharif crops on 878.23 lakh hectares as against 855.85 lakh in the year-ago period, as per the Agriculture Ministry’s latest data. Paddy — the main kharif crop — was sown on 280.03 lakh hectares as against 266.93 lakh, while pulses covered 121.28 lakh hectares as against 116.95 lakh in the same period. However, oilseeds acreage was down at 148.88 lakh hectare till last week of the kharif season from 165.49 lakh hectare in the same period last year. He said the overall acreage for all pulses is higher, except tur. With regard to cash crops, he said the overall area sown to cotton and sugarcane was higher than last year so far. Cotton acreage has increased to 114.34 lakh hectare so far in the 2017-18 kharif season from 96.48 lakh in the year-ago period on account of good rain and better prices. — PTI"
Imprisoned in paradise,"BOOK REVIEW: POST-TRUTH: BEHOLD, I SHINE BY FRENY MANECKSHA.

Sumayyah Qureshi

Women and children are the silent sufferers in any conflict. They are usually the major war casualties, sometimes behind the scenes. In Kashmir, which has seen endless violence over the decades, perpetrated by both, the militants and the security apparatus, women and children have had to suffer immensely — denting their emotional, mental and physical well-being. In the book, the author, Freny Manecksha, quotes from Habba Khatun's verses, who was a mystic wanderer and Kashmir's most loved poetess. Manecksha draws a comparison between the peaceful times that prevailed during Habba Khatun's life and at the present times. ""There lives a time when groups of girls could pick chinar leaves and twist them into ornaments, or walk into forests to collect firewood, or celebrate the coming of spring in badamwaris."" Kashmir has come a long way from the times of Habba Khatun. Its women have been robbed off the freedom to live a carefree life that Habba Khatun saw and described in her verses. That idyllic life is a thing of the past now. There are many dangers, numerous threats, there are no more safe places under the chinar trees or in the forests, where women once collected firewood. The spring in badamwari comes and goes, patiently awaiting the revellers that once visited. It is all suffused with a dogged sombreness that looks difficult to shake off. As jackboots become as ubiquitous as chinars, Kashmiri women have felt the shrinking of spaces and curtailment of freedom. They feel gagged in their own land. The author talks about militarisation and how it has affected the overall quality of life of women. She has spoken to many Kashmiri women, including journalists, writers and human rights activists, to know what it means to live in the most militarised zone in the world. The scars that these women have beared are not visible to the eye but lie buried deep within, entrenched in their psyche, mostly festering, as the endless war that these women fight, with themselves and with the outside forces, continues. The usual narrative about the Kashmiri conflict has majorly revolved around the atrocities suffered by men. This book is among the few works that has taken up the cause of state's faceless, identity-less, oppressed women. It is a small yet significant contribution by Manecksha in which she has written about the sufferings of the women torn apart by conflict. Despite the odds, these women are picking up the threads of life and moving on with their battered lives. This work is a tribute to the indomitable spirit of Kashmiri women, to their resilience and perseverance and never-ending quest for truth and justice."

The Chandigarh Police on Monday said there were no CCTV footage of an incident involving Haryana BJP president Subhash Barala's son who is accused of stalking the daughter of a senior IAS officer.Deputy Superintendent of Police Satish Kumar told the media that they tried to get CCTV footage from nine CCTV cameras along the route, from Sector 7 to Housing Board traffic light point, but all were found to be ""non-functional"".The route along which Vikas Barala and his friend Ashish Kumar stalked the victim, Varnika Kundu, daughter of Haryana Additional Chief Secretary V.S. Kundu, passes through some prominent and busy parts of Chandigarh, including the Sector 26 Police Lines. The two accused were booked on Saturday. Both were apprehended from the Housing Board light point here and were said to be drunk. ""It is strange that the CCTV cameras of such high-profile areas were not working. This seems to be a cover-up,"" a junior police officer said. The victim and her family have said they will fight the case to its ""logical conclusion"".Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala today said that the BJP is hatching a conspiracy to shield the Haryana state chief's son, who harassed and stalked an IAS officer's daughter in an alleged inebriated state in Chandigarh.

“This is extremely clear that the BJP is pressurising Chandigarh administration and hatching conspiracy to protect the son of its political leader. May we ask on behalf of people of India if drunken youth, goons chase a girl for seven kilometers, attempt to block her car and forcibly open the door and try to enter the car, is it not the case of abduction and outraging the modest of a woman? Why have these offences not been lodged? The Prime Minister and chief minister must answer these questions to the people of country,” Surjewala said.

Narrating the horrific ordeal, the girl told the media she was lucky for not being the daughter of a common man.

""I'm lucky, it seems, to not be the daughter of a common man, because what chance would they have against such VIPs? I'm also lucky, because I'm not lying raped and murdered in a ditch somewhere,"" the woman wrote in a Facebook post, pointing that the two men she accused of perturbing her ""are from influential families with political connections.” — Agencies"

“I want justice to prevail so that such youths all over the country get a lesson that they can’t go scot-free,” said the IAS officer whose daughter was stalked by two youths, including the son of Haryana BJP president Subhash Barala. Vikas Barala (23), an LLB student, and his friend, Ashish Kumar (22), a law graduate, were arrested for stalking and wrongful restraint after they tried to block the victim’s way, who was driving a car, and also chased her before being nabbed by the police at one of the light points. “This incident is not just about my daughter, but about the safety of all girls in the city,” said the IAS officer. The bureaucrat, who is firm on his daughter’s decision to pursue the case, said he would take the case to its logical end. He said it should not be treated as a tussle between a bureaucrat and a politician. “I visited the police station as a father, not as a bureaucrat. As a citizen of this country, I have the right to seek justice,” he said. Asked about both accused being granted bail, the IAS officer said he would not like to comment on whether the bail should have been granted but wondered what the police would have done had the same thing happened with their daughters. The victim’s father said both accused, being law students, were aware about the repercussions of such an act, but still went ahead with it. The accused apologised to the victim after learning that she was a bureaucrat’s daughter. However, neither the victim nor her father heeded their requests."

Lucknow, August 7

In the backdrop of three MLCs recently quitting the party and joining the BJP, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said those who wanted to go, should go without offering any excuse, so that he could ascertain who were with him in ""bad times"".

Referring to the ""excuses"" put forward by the three MLCs -- Bukkal Nawab, Sarojini Agarwal and Yashwant Singh -- while leaving the party, Yadav said, ""Some people are saying they were feeling suffocated as the atmosphere of the party had gone bad. This should not be an excuse for leaving the party, they should find a better excuse.""

Asserting that the party was doing well and a large number of women, farmers and youths had joined it recently, he said, ""Those who want to leave the party should not give any excuse...they can just leave. In that case, at least I will get to know who are with us during bad times.""

The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister was addressing the party workers at the SP headquarters here on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.

Yadav said he had paid a visit to Nawab on Eid and had 'sewai' (a sweet dish) with him.

""At that time, he (Nawab) had not mentioned that he was planning to leave the party. It has come to our notice that there was some land issue, due to which he was being pressured,"" he added.

In a dig at Nawab and the BJP, Yadav said, ""They (BJP) are doing good work. It is ironic that when a person is not in the BJP, he is labelled as a land mafia and when he joins the party, he becomes honest, upright and a gentleman.

On Agarwal, who runs a medical college in Meerut in the name of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, Yadav said he was not aware of what the matter was with her.

""There could be a land issue behind it as well,"" he added.

"SUVs, luxury cars to cost more as GST cess hiked to 25 per cent","New Delhi, August 7

SUVs, mid-sized, large and luxury cars that had become cheaper after GST rollout on July 1 will cost more as the GST Council has approved a proposal to hike cess on them to 25 per cent, from 15 per cent now.

(Follow

; and

)

Under the new GST regime, cars attract the top tax rate of 28 per cent. On top of this, a cess of 1-15 per cent is levied on them to create a corpus to compensate states for loss of revenue from GST implementation.

The Finance Ministry, in a statement, said that after introduction of GST, the total tax on motor vehicles (GST plus compensation cess) has come down vis-a-vis the total incidence in pre-GST regime.

“The GST Council considered this issue in its 20th meeting held on August 5 and recommended that the Central Government may move legislative amendments required for increasing the maximum ceiling of cess leviable on motor vehicles falling under headings 8702 and 8703 to 25 per cent instead of the present 15 per cent,” the statement read.

The decision on when to raise the actual cess leviable on the same will be taken by the GST Council in due course, it added.

The increase in compensation cess will require amendment to the Schedule to section 8 of the GST (Compensation to a State) Act, 2017.

The vehicles that fall under headings 8702 and 8703 include mid-segment, large cars, SUVs and motor vehicles which can carry more than 10 persons, but less than 13.

Also, hybrid vehicles with engine capacity of more than 1500 cc and mid-segment hybrid cars of less than 1500 cc fall in the category.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Fitment Committee—which is responsible for calculating the tax rates on various goods and services—at its meeting on July 25 felt that the total tax incidence in GST seems to have come down vis-a-vis pre-GST total tax figure.

The highest pre-GST tax incidence on motor vehicles worked out to about 52-54.72 per cent, to which 2.5 per cent was added on account of CST, octroi etc.

Against this, post- GST, the total tax incidence came to 43 per cent.

After 28 per cent GST, to maintain the pre-GST tax incidence, the highest compensation cess rate required will have to be 25 per cent, the fitment committee felt. Against this, the ceiling rate of compensation cess on motor vehicles is 15 per cent.

Prices of most SUVs were cut between Rs 1.1 lakh and Rs 3 lakh following implementation of GST, which subsumed over a dozen central and state levies like excise duty, service tax and VAT, from July 1.

While all cars attract a peak GST rate of 28 per cent, large motor vehicles, SUVs, mid-segment, large, hybrid cars and hybrid motor vehicles attract a cess of 15 per cent on top of it.

Small petrol cars of less than 4 metres and 1200 cc are marked for a cess of 1 per cent while small diesel cars of less than 4 meters and 1500 cc engine are levied a cess of 3 per cent.

The cess collected on cars as also tobacco and coal will be used to compensate the revenue loss of states by implementing GST. For this, a separate statute has been passed by Parliament. This prescribes the maximum cess rate.

And now, to change that cess rate, an amendment to this law will be needed. — PTI"

The Tribune: Sport news,"LONDON: American Tori Bowie won the women’s 100 metres world title making up for her silver in last year’s Olympics while Rio gold medallist Elaine Thompson struggled home in fifth place.

London, August 7

American Tori Bowie won the women’s 100 metres world title making up for her silver in last year’s Olympics, while Rio gold medallist Elaine Thompson struggled home in fifth place.

The 26-year-old on Sunday made up metres on long time leader Marie-Josee Ta Lou of the Ivory Coast to edge her with the final dip on the line at the World Athletics Championships.

Bowie fell to the ground after crossing the line and initially it was Ta Lou who celebrated only for the board to say otherwise.

“I had no idea that I had won,” said Bowie, who has a habit of hurling herself at the line in major championships finals having done a similar thing in the Olympic 200m final last year which saw her take the bronze.

“The only thing I knew was that tonight I was going to lay it all on the line.”

The Netherlands’ Dafne Schippers finished third while hot favourite and 100m Olympic champion Thompson faded to fifth.

The 25-year-old Jamaican had started well but by halfway she had been swallowed up and was unable to find an extra gear as she had done most of the season.

Ta Lou then emerged as the clear leader but Bowie ate into her advantage and then produced the dip of her life to take the title from under the diminutive Ivorian’s nose.

Ta Lou’s compatriot and 2013 world double sprint medalist Murielle Ahoure also suffered frustration in being edged out of bronze by Schippers, who will look to retain her world 200m title later in the week. AFP"

A team was appointed to bring down tempers with Khushwant Singh being a prominent member of it, he said.

The Congress leader said the celebrated author believed in truth and wrote it, adding that his books would live in the hearts and minds of people.

In response to a question on Khushwant’s decision to support the imposition of Emergency and sterilisation programme by the then Indira Gandhi government, Amarinder said one could agree or disagree with the methods adopted at that time, but the fact is that population is a matter of serious concern.

The Punjab Chief Minister was joined by former Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee. — PTI"

The actor invited only two sarpanches on the promotion of his film ‘Toilet: Ek Prem Katha’ in Gurugram on August 4 to receive the honour. Jabna became the youngest sarpanch at 22 who took the initiative of the cleanliness mission in her panchayat and set up dustbins to collect garbage at one place. She held discussions with village people and motivated them to adopt sanitation system and segregate liquid and solid waste at home which will help the authorities to dispose of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste in a proper manner. She had won the district-level award for best pradhan and her panchayat was adjudged the best in the district in terms of cleanliness. Her efforts were recognized by the state government and she was felicitated by Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh and Governor Acharya Devvrat. She was also a member of a delegation at the national-level function of women panchayat representatives at Gandhinagar in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi had participated. She was conferred the Citation Letter for her outstanding efforts during the event held on International Women’s Day. This year in February, she took another initiative to ban liquor serving in marriages and other special occasions in her panchayat. Convinced with her decision, members of the panchayat decided to unanimously follow the advice. Jabna is now struggling to remove liquor vend out of her panchayat and a resolution was handed over to the Deputy Commissioner but the voice of people goes unheard. Akashay Kumar appreciated her initiatives and honoured her during a function. He said there was need for such young women to come forward to bring a change in society. Talking to The Tribune here today, Jabna gave credit of her success to village people and said she was happy to receive honour from renowned actor Akshay Kumar and she would try to give her best to the society. She said another sarpanch Priyanka Bharti of Uttar Pradesh was also honoured. She had left her in-laws house after the marriage due to lack of toilet facility. She returned to her husband’s house after the construction of toilet, who later became a brand ambassador of the cleanliness mission."
India’s data security laws adequate for exchanging banking info: Swiss govt,"New Delhi/Berne, August 6

Switzerland found India’s data security and confidentiality laws “adequate” for entering into an automatic exchange of information pact, which will open a continuous access to details about alleged black money hoarders in once-all-secret Swiss banks.

(Follow

)

In a detailed notification and fact sheet published in its official gazette for introduction of “automatic exchange of information relating to financial accounts with India”, the Swiss government has also cited decisions by other financial centres like Liechtenstein and Bahamas to enter into similar pacts.

Besides, Switzerland also took note of the US tax authority, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), recognising India among the countries that provide an “adequate degree” of data protection for mutual exchange of tax information.

The fact sheet and the notification, published in German, also talks about Switzerland looking to explore greater access to Indian market, including the reinsurance sector and other financial services.

The Swiss Federal Council, the top governing body of the European nation, in June ratified automatic exchange of financial account information with India and 40 other jurisdictions to facilitate immediate sharing of details about suspected black money even as it sought strict adherence to confidentiality and data security.

Taking the decision forward, the Swiss government has now notified the decision and the notification authorises the Council to notify India about the exact date when such automatic exchange must take place.

The implementation is currently planned for 2018 and the first set of data should be exchanged in 2019. The decision is not subject to any referendum—which means there should be no further procedural delay in its implementation.

The issue of black money has been a matter of big debate in India, and Switzerland has been long perceived as one of the safest havens for the illicit wealth allegedly stashed abroad by Indians.

The notification follows hectic parleys between India and Switzerland for introduction of the AEOI (Automatic Exchange of Information) on tax matters under the guidance of G20, OECD and other global organisations.

In the fact sheet about India, which forms part of the notification about all 41 jurisdictions selected for AEOI by Switzerland, the Swiss government noted India showed its commitment for implementing the international pact with effect from 2016 itself and “adaptations of the internal laws necessary for the implementation were made in good time”.

Listing various changes to the tax laws and introduction of new laws for fighting black money stashed abroad as well as within the country, the Swiss government said, “The legal, administrative and technical framework for confidentiality and data security in India was deemed satisfactory by the Global Forum’s panel of experts.”

The Swiss Federal Department of Finance assessed this evaluation and found them to be “adequate”, the notification said.

It further said that India negotiated with the US a model intergovernmental agreement on FATCA for reciprocal exchange of information, which has entered into force after the IRS assessed the level of confidentiality and data security in India and found it “appropriate”.

“All agreements concerning the exchange of tax information concluded by India contain a confidentiality clause which corresponds to that of the model OECD agreement,” it noted, while adding that the country’s Income Tax Act contain other confidentiality provisions as well.

The notification also referred to the personal data protection measures provided in other laws of the country, incoming the Informational Technology Act and the Right to Information Act.

The Swiss government will prepare a situation report before the first exchange of data for which confidentiality and data protection requirements are to be strictly followed.

On access to Indian market, the Swiss government said the Indian market is not one of the strategic markets targeted by Switzerland-based financial services providers for their cross-border activities, as “bureaucratic and prudential obstacles were generally more difficult to overcome”.

Nonetheless, they are interested in taking advantage of improved governance conditions and greater legal certainty in the financial services sector, particularly in the reinsurance sector.

Switzerland said the two countries have committed to improve the framework conditions for cross-border business activities to give a boost to international investment and financial services segments. — PTI"

Three sanitation workers died after inhaling toxic gases while cleaning a gutter in Lajpat Nagar, said a police officer.

A PCR call was registered at 1 pm today that three persons are dead in a sewage drain in the Lajpat Nagar area. On reaching the spot, it was noticed by the police that some workers were checking a sewer line opposite MCD office near Kabir Ram temple and when they entered the sewer line, they were exposed to obnoxious gases and felt suffocated, said DCP Romila Baniya, South East District.

Soon they were taken to AIIMS Trauma centre where they were declared brought dead.

The deceased have been identified as Joginder (32), Annu (28), both residents of Khichidipur, the third person is still unidentified. His age is said to be 25 years. Legal action under 304 IPC is being taken, said the DCP.

Meanwhile, BJP president Manoj Tiwari has urged the Lt Governor Anil Baijal to order a high-level probe into the death of Safai Karamcharis reported to have been privately hired by a Junior Engineer of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB).

It is being said that the DJB officials did not ensure compliance of safety measures before starting the cleaning work, said Tiwari.

The DJB should immediately clarify whether the said Safai Karamcharis were its regular employees or casually hired. And it is not the first incident of death of such workers during the cleaning of sewers. The attitude of the Jal Board officials continues to be callous, added the BJP president.

Further, the BJP president has urged the LT Governor that the families of all three young Safai Karamcharis be paid compensation even if they were casually hired.

On its part, the government has ordered an inquiry into the incident while Water Minister Rajendra Gautam said the three deceased were neither DJB staff nor authorised to carry out the sewer cleaning job.

""I am very sad to know that 3 workers have died during cleaning of sewer at Lajpat Nagar I have set up an inquiry,"" tweeted the Water Minister."

The prisoners belong to all faiths and nationalities and were in jail because of their inability to clear debts even though they have completed their jail terms.

Merchant dedicated this award and medal to his countrymen living in and outside the country.

“I am sincerely thankful to the UAE government for acknowledging my efforts. Whatever I have done, and will continue to do, is for the love of the UAE and India. I represent my country India and the UAE is my second home. I will do whatever I can for this beautiful country and its people,” he said.

Merchant said he is helping those who are the victims of circumstances.

“These people (prisoners) are not criminals. They are in jail because they unfortunately accumulated debt and have not been able to clear them,” said 59-year-old Merchant who began his gold business in 1989.

Speaking on the occasion, Nahyan, said he was very happy with the philanthropic work being done by Merchant and would want him to continue his noble work in future too.

He also applauded Merchant for his good deeds and said that it makes him feel proud to have expatriates such as Merchant who selflessly and tirelessly work for the betterment of the society.

He assured Merchant all necessary cooperation from the government as and when required.

Undersecretary of the Ministry of Interior, Lt General Saif Abdullah Al Shafar, who was also present during the award ceremony acknowledged Merchant’s philanthropic activities and considered him to be a great human who had always stood by the less fortunate.

Besides the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Interior, Lt General Saif Abdullah al-Shafar, Major General Salam Al Shamshi and many senior police officials were also present on the occasion. — PTI"
"A heady cocktail: Sports, marketing & nationalism","These forces coincided brilliantly for Vijender’s bout against China’s Zulpikar

Rohit Mahajan

Good marketing can sell anything. Nothing sells as easily as nationalism. Sport is the best medium to engage in peaceful warfare. These three golden rules coincided brilliantly last night in Mumbai — Vijender Singh beat China’s Zulpikar Maimaitiali. He defended his WBO Asia Pacific super middleweight title and annexed Maimaitiali’s WBO Oriental super middleweight. It was a match made in marketing-sporting heaven — with India and China engaged in a standoff at the border, it was easy to rouse nationalistic fervour in a bid to sell tickets, attract a large TV audience, and gather sponsors.

Trash-talk

Among the sports in which the aim is to batter the opponent, boxing is the most popular. Boxing is also marked by another very dubious trait —trash-talking. In no other sport is it customary — compulsory, even — to throw insults at your opponent before a contest. Muhammad Ali was a genius trash-talker who didn’t need to be motivated or tutored, but a lot of times the trash-talking is encouraged and even scripted by the marketing people. Before the fight, Vijender did his bit to rouse passions in India, saying: “Chinese products don’t last for long. I don’t think it will take so long (to beat Maimaitiali).” This was a cheap shot, but such stuff is only expected before boxing matches. Maimaitiali’s response was quieter but more ominous, possibly hinting at the 1962 war between the two countries. “I will show Vijender what Chinese are capable of. We have shown India time and again what China is capable of... It is time that Vijender too learns his lesson,” Maimaitiali said.

Close win

In the event, Vijender won the closely-contested fight which was watched by, among others, Amitabh Bachchan and his son. The dad even got to put his hand over Vijender’s shoulder and congratulate him. Having won the fight, Vijender can now be the bigger man — he offered Maimaitiali’s belt back to him, “for the sake of peace at the border”, even though such titles aren’t personal properties that can be gifted at a boxer’s whim. After the fight, excited people who believe themselves to be great patriots sent each other messages such as this: “Sachche Deshbhakt Ki Pehchan! Cheen Ke Mooh Par Karara Tamacha.” A professional boxer who took up sport to make a living is a “true patriot” because he defeated a boxer from China. Bachchan best displayed the reason for the nationalistic pride in Vijender when he added: “A slug fest but WE won!” Would “WE” have lost if Vijender had lost? But the ability to ponder over this point is lost to even very senior citizens such as Bachchan. Such is the power of Marketing + Sport X Nationalism.

The Tribune-Sunday Special,"Parts of Haryana, Rajasthan, UP and Delhi report a ‘phantom barber’ chopping off braids of unsuspecting women, usually from rural areas. The police and civic officials have launched awareness campaigns, but the effect is not known

[ + read story ]

It has been five days and teenaged Saanya (name changed) refuses to leave her room, holding on to her hijab and getting scared even by a slight flutter of a newspaper. She was a chirpy girl until July 31: she had picked up a comb to hurriedly manage her mane. The moment it touched her hair, her braid came off. Screaming, she fainted and almost the entire village rushed to see the latest victim of ‘phantom barber.’

Similar incidents have been reported from Delhi, Gurugram Rewari and Fatehabad where the victims blame a witch, saying they saw black cats before falling unconscious. Some people have started putting up neem leaves, lemon & chilli bunches, talismans and even cow dung on the entrances of their houses to ward off the “evil spirits.”

The fear has led to both Hindu and Muslim religious leaders coming up with special charms and enchantments to ward off the phantom barber. Anti-witch hair bands have made it to local markets in Mewat and are being sold for as high as Rs 100 apiece.

Several braid saving experts are offering doorstep services and roaming the streets selling their talent to keep one’s house safer through turmeric-stained handprints or a special talisman. A series of songs have been composed on braid chopping.

Call it fear or hysteria, some people say the ‘phantom barber’ is a paranormal entity going around chopping braids of women in Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The ‘phenomenon’ is believed to be the biggest since 2001 when ‘monkey man’ started prowling the district of Nagaur in Rajasthan.

How it began

The state police were startled when a video went viral in Nagaur in the second week of June. The clip showed two men thrashing a woman, forcing her to repeatedly recite various names of gods. The two were traced and arrested and their revelation brought the story of the ‘phantom barber’ to fore. They told the police that the woman was a ‘Baal Kataani’ — a witch who was chopping off the braids of local women. The two produced a WhatsApp message in support of their claim.

Within days the district thanas were flooded with over 20 complaints about braid chopping incidents. With no concrete evidence, no FIR was registered. Soon, similar cases started surfacing from Bikaner, Jodhpur, Sikar and Jaipur districts. A few cases were registered, but no major breakthrough came.

While the matter was about to be written off as an odd rumour in Rajasthan, alarm bells rang out in Haryana, Delhi and UP with a barrage of reports of braid chopping reaching the authorities.

Mewat is the worst hit by phantom barber: the district police have received over 250 cases, but have registered only one case. Areas like Punhana, Ferozpur Jhirka, Nuh and Hathin have reported around 50 cases each to the local administration though victims have flatly refused to go to the police, fearing for their lives.

The victims in Rajasthan have not explained much about the mysterious chopping. In Gurugram, though, such victims are talking about a ‘shape shifter’ who is seen for a few seconds before a woman falls unconscious and her braid is chopped. The fall-out has been serious: women have been confined to homes with hair tied up in buns after being massaged with badly smelling oils. The youths of villages are forming special groups to man the areas at night, and are even catching hold of suspects and turning them over to the police.

Suppressed fear?

Most say it is something similar to the 2001 case where victims saw flashes of monkey assaults. But it all turned out to be a mere hysteria. “All of this started with WhatsApp messages. If you review profiles of the targeted women, you would find most of them coming from suppressed sections of society living with constant sense of victimization. And when anything of this sort happens, they are vulnerable to illusions of being targeted,” says Ritika Sen, a city-based psychologist and behavioral expert. “No woman living in condominiums has been touched. A detailed investigation of victims will tell us how many of these cases are genuine. Paranormal entities do exist, but their effect is localized,” said Sen.

The city administration also dismisses it as a scare. “There are many self-proclaimed victims. But they are not ready to file a police complaint even after much persuasion. We are currently more focused on spreading awareness and preventing rumours. Panchayats and maulvis are getting in touch with the victims and persuading villagers to deal with it logically,” said Mani Ram Sharma, Deputy Commissioner, Mewat."
Notes that bridge the gap,"Shubha Mudgal on increasing the scope of Hindustani classical music in the age of smartphone

Neha Kirpal

Shubha Mudgal knows the new generation speaks a different language. She knows attending classical music concerts is a thing of the past for them. But, who said Hindustani can’t go to the youth? To reach out to them, Shubha is talking to them in their language. That of apps, streaming, etc. The Padma Shri awardee has, along with her husband, Aneesh Pradhan, established an online distribution platform for musicians specialising in diverse forms of Indian music through the website www.UnderscoreRecords.com. Among the many projects, they have initiated in their efforts to preserve the rich musical heritage of India is www.SangeetKosh.net, an online encyclopedia of Indian music. Shubha Mudgal talks to us, among other things, about the challenges Hindustani classical music scene is facing and its future.I have been a student of Hindustani classical music for over 35 years now and there have indeed been quite a few noticeable changes. On a positive note, festivals that have put in sustained efforts to promote classical music for decades witness a marked increase in audience numbers. As a result, leading festivals now attract listeners in many thousands. However, smaller music circles — that have also made an invaluable contribution — find it difficult to attract audiences and organise concerts periodically due to the lack of funds and support. Some of the bigger music festivals have also had to downsize due to the lack of adequate sponsorship. As instruments like keyboards, guitars and drums find more takers, traditional artisans and master craftsmen, who make acoustic Indian instruments like the tanpura and the sitar, find it difficult to sustain themselves. Many of them prefer to look for other professions for their children. It will be a pity if their mastery is lost to future generations.I think platforms like YouTube throw up an absolute treasure of music. But a listening guide that explains facts in simple terms is what is difficult to come by. There are various artistes and scholars who are attempting to put together music appreciation modules. However, this is not a simple task and requires some experimenting, scripting and a fair bit of research and development — all of which require support and funding. It is hard enough to find sponsors for events and performances in India. I can imagine what a Herculean task it would be to look for sponsors for music education modules.From Spotify (currently not available in India) to Gaana and YouTube, every platform is available for music lovers to explore. The problem lies in making the right discovery. If you don’t know which artiste, raag, style or instrument you want to hear, you could just wade around forever more and not find the music that you might enjoy.No, I think it has already been proved in case of the Gandharva channel, InSync, etc. that listeners of Hindustani classical music don’t want to buy subscriptions. Further, the programming needs to be innovative and technically on par with other channels. Settling for mediocre or low quality, badly produced content simply to fulfill the 24-hour mandate is not going to help Hindustani classical music, its exponents or its listeners. Therefore, it is best that no attempt be made to start dedicated television or radio channels till these issues are worked out in the greatest detail.There are enough awards, and enough dirt and corruption around the existing awards for me to say categorically that more awards are only going to create a bigger scramble and tussle for them.Both plays revolve around forms and styles of music that I have been studying for decades. Both are directed by Purva Naresh who is herself trained in kathak, pakhawaj and music. Therefore, the experience was pleasant, enriching and satisfying.Well, I am no specialist in composing music for either films or theatre. But when the subject or script demands the involvement of a trained Hindustani musician, I am happy to be involved and collaborate, if my schedule permits me to do so."
Invest in NHAI bonds to save capital gain tax,"TAX ADVICE SC VASUDEVA

Invest in NHAI bonds to save capital gain tax

My father-in-law retired from Indian Railways in 1978 and settled at Darapur village which is in close proximity to Tanda town, a sub-tehsil of Hoshiarpur district. He bought a 10-marla agriculture land in his own name and another 10 marla land in the name of his eldest of the three sons and built 816 sq ft house at a cost of Rs 4.5 lakh (approximately). [No records are available]. He kept on improving the property but again records are not available. The land was purchased at a total cost of Rs 16,500 in February 1979 [registered deed is available] . He expired in April 2017, leaving a will for this property in the name of his three sons with equal share for each. This property has now been sold by his sons in May 2017 at a total price of Rs 46 lakh. Three brothers have decided to share proceeds of Rs 42 lakh equally among themselves and all four real sisters at Rs 6 lakh each. Rs 1 lakh will be donated to gurdwara as per will of the deceased and Rs 3 lakh have been spent on his last rites. In this connection following clarifications are requested: 1. Is any tax payable for sale of property and if so, how much? 2. How much tax is payable by each of the three sons and each of four daughters even though the will is in favour of three sons only. 3. If tax is payable then can it be avoided by any means or measures? 4. Even though the property has been sold by three sons, the purchaser has been asked to transfer Rs 6 lakh directly to accounts of each sister. Is this in order or some measures need to be taken to regularise the payments. — Rajinder Saini Replies to your queries which are given under are based on the presumption that the agricultural land bought by your father was situated within 8 km of Tanda town and therefore is to be considered as a ‘capital asset’. Further, as the capital asset has been transferred in May 2017, the reply given hereunder is based on the amended provisions of the Act. a) Section 48 of the Act provides that for the purpose of computing capital gain on the transfer of a capital asset, cost of the capital asset and cost of any improvement thereon, shall be deducted from the consideration received or receivable on the transfer of such capital asset. It has also been provided in Section 55 of the Act that in case the capital asset has been purchased before 1.4.2001, the assessee has an option to adopt fair market value of the asset as on 1.4.2001 and such fair market value of the capital asset shall be indexed by giving a benefit of cost inflation index so as to ascertain the cost deductible for the purposes of computing the amount of capital gain. The amount of fair market value as on 1.4.2001 should be much more as compared to the cost of the land in 1979. It will therefore be desirable to obtain a valuation certificate from an approved valuer for ascertaining such fair market value. The amount of capital gain has not been computed as the fair market value as on 1.4.2001 has not been indicated in the query. It may be added that each of the sons would be liable to pay income-tax on their share (i.e. 1/3rd) of the amount of long-term capital gain arising on the transfer of the property. b) No tax will be payable by daughters of the deceased as the amount received by them would be treated as a gift by the brothers. c) Tax on the amount of capital gain could have been saved provided each of the sons had utilised their share of the long-term capital gain towards buying tax-saving bonds issued by National Highways Authority of India or Rural Electrification Corporation Limited within six months of the date of transfer. Alternatively, each one of them could have saved the amount of tax, if the amount of long-term capital gain had been utilised for purchase or construction of a residential house individually or jointly by them. The purchase of such residential house should have been made within one year before or two years after the transfer of the property. The construction of residential house should have been effected within three years after the date of the transfer of the property. d) The payment of Rs 6 lakh directly to the daughters of the deceased would not make any difference with regard to taxability of the amount of capital gain."
Sikhs top target of hate crimes in US: Community leaders,"Washington, August 7

Sikhs are one of the top targets of hate crimes and sectarian violence in the US, the community leaders have said as they remembered victims of the 2012 mass shooting by a white supremacist that claimed the lives of six Sikhs at a Gurdwara in the Wisconsin city.

Several eminent Sikh-Americans from across the US, lawmakers, government officials and local leaders participated in prayers held on the weekend to mark the five-year anniversary of the mass shooting.

""We have made commendable efforts to secure our Gurdwara Sahib's all across the country and taken many preventive measures. But Sikhs are still one of the top targets of hate crimes, sectarian violence, and bullying in American schools.

In recent years, attacks have rather increased in many fold,” said Gurinder Singh Khalsa, who heads the Sikhs Political Action Committee.

""Hate has no colour. Hate has no face. Yet we all saw hate five years ago,"" Blahair Dulai, president of the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, said, addressing the gathering.

""When you come together and those hearts and minds connect, the presence of the divine is there and you don't even have to say a word,"" he added.

Among the speakers at the Gurdwara was retired Oak Creek Police officer Brian Murphy, who was shot fifteen times before the shooter was brought down.

""When something is stolen from you, when the lives were stolen from everyone here, you can't get that back,"" Murphy said.

Remembering the victims, he said, ""The voices of the people that were lost are still here. August 5, 2012 changed a lot of people's lives, but remember the people that were here on August 4 and all the times before that."" On August 5, 2012, six Sikhs were killed and three more were wounded, along with the Oak Creek police officer, when the white supremacist armed with a gun attacked the Oak Creek Sikh Temple in Wisconsin.

On Saturday, the Gurdwara organised a six-mile run. The House Speaker, Paul Ryan, sent a two-minute video on the occasion. Vanita Gupta, former Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights were among prominent people to speak on the occasion. —PTI"
The script of love and lyrics,"Urdu, the language of Mir, Ghalib, Faiz and Firaq has a rich literary tradition, which must not be allowed to wither away

Kuldip Dhiman

When poet Jaleel Manakpuri was being felicitated by an organiser who was not familiar with the nuances of Urdu, a friend sitting next to the poet said, “Jaleel sahab, aaj aap zaleel hone wale hain.” (Jaleel sahib, today you are going to be humiliated). This is because a slight difference in pronunciation can change the meaning completely in Urdu. Jaleel means ‘glorious’, and if pronounced zaleel, it means ‘to be humiliated’. Urdu, along with its twin sister Hindi, has been a language of the masses for more than 700 years. Both grew out of what is called khari boli, the general language of communication in northern India. While Urdu is normally written in the Persian script, and has more Persian, Turkish and Arabic words, Hindi is written in the Devanagari and inclines more towards Sanskrit. These are virtually indistinguishable to the outsider. The name ‘Urdu’ has its origins in the Turkish word ordu which means ‘army camp’, and over the centuries, it has produced great literature, especially poetry. A single sher (couplet) of Urdu can help you express what cannot be said in a thousand words. However, with the rise of English as the lingua franca, and with an unfair association of Urdu with religion, this beautiful language seems to be losing favour with the masses. Many Urdu aficionados have begun to feel that the language is slowly dying, while experts in the field hold that Urdu is doing much better than before. Rekhta, an organisation devoted to the promotion of Urdu language and literature, recently held a mushaira (poetic gathering) at the Tagore Theatre, Chandigarh. If numbers are any indication, it was heartening to see that the hall was jam-packed with young and old, with many of them standing outside the theatre hall to listen to the poets. The same is true of wherever mushairas are held. Litterateurs from Punjab such as Saadat Hasan Manto, Sahir Ludhianvi, Krishan Chander, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Gulzar and hundreds of others have made tremendous contribution to popularise Urdu. Its popularity notwithstanding, Urdu certainly remains in the shadow of English. Dr Kumud Bansal, Chairperson, Haryana Urdu Akademi, Panchkula, observes, “Not just Urdu, all Indian languages are suffering. Children are not being taught their mother tongue anymore. Most parents want their children to learn only English. This is because of the slave mentality we have. This is the reason we need Urdu academies. Have you heard of an English academy?” We move over to Malerkotla, a town rich in Urdu culture. Talking about the current health of Urdu, Dr Rubina Shabnam, Secretary, Punjab Urdu Academy, Malerkotla, says: “Urdu is the language that emerged in the undivided Punjab. In his book, Punjab Mein Urdu, Hafiz Mehmood Khan Shirani, the great linguistic and researcher, has shown through research based on historical evidence that the greater Punjab was the birthplace of Urdu. So Urdu is rooted in this region.” However, not all scholars agree with Shirani. Talking about the academy and its aims, Dr Shabnam says, “We started in 2014, and we have a budget of only Rs 50,000 per annum. Even with this meagre sum, we have managed to hold stage programmes but have not been able to publish anything. Now, the government has given us a one-time sum of Rs 3 crore. With this, we hope to realise the aims of the academy. Recently, I met Manpreet Badal, Finance Minister, and he said he would give us a hundred crore rupees. If we got this amount, we would be able to encourage Urdu writers, and poets. Presently, we are starting free Urdu learning centres in six cities of Sunam, Bathinda, Ropar, Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Patiala.” Regarding the popularity of Urdu, Prof Mahmood Alam, former professor at Government College, ex-secretary, Punjab Urdu Academy, Malerkotla, and writer of a poetry collection Shikast-e-Khwab, says: “If you ask me about the current status of Urdu, I would say it is far better than before. Two decades ago, Urdu was not being taught in as many schools as it is being taught now, and there were not as many students as we have now. During my time, there used to be four teachers, and we had about four or five students who wanted to learn Urdu. Now you have 30 students, but unfortunately only one teacher. Many wish to learn Urdu but they get discouraged because it does not offer employment opportunities.” Rubbishing language politics, Professor Alam observes, “People say that there is friction between Hindi and Urdu. They say languages create conflict between different people, but this is not so. Languages bring people together. If Hindi and Punjabi speakers learn Urdu, their Hindi and Punjabi pronunciation will improve, and vice versa.” One has to learn the finer points of this language in order to speak it well. As Dagh Dehalvi puts it: “Nahin khel ai Dagh yaron se kah do; Ki ati hai Urdu zaban ate ate” (O! Dagh, tell friends that learning Urdu is not a child’s play; It takes its own time to be mastered). Amarnath Wadehra, a diehard Urdu protagonist, remembers the days of his youth when Urdu poets were a rage in Lahore, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and the rest of Punjab. “There used to be regular mushairas that went on all night, and people came in hordes to listen to their favourite poets like Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Sahir Ludhianvi, Firaq Gorakhpuri and many other stalwarts. Urdu poets did a lot to fan the flames of the freedom moment, and bring about a social change. Many freedom fighters sacrificed their lives for the country singing ‘Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil mei hai’. The younger generation should learn English for getting jobs, but they must also learn Urdu to enrich their personality.” Born in 1937, Pakpattan, Pakistan, Dr HK Lall has been teaching Urdu for the past four decades. “Urdu is in my blood. My father taught it to my brother and me.” Even at 81, he continues to teach the language untiringly. “Khidmat-e-Urdu karunga umr bhar; Yeh meri puja, mera imaan hai.” (I will serve Urdu all my life; It is my worship, it is my conscience).

Disappearing readers

Propagators notwithstanding, the fact is that the circulation of Urdu newspapers and magazines is going down by the day. In 2001, the total number of Urdu newspapers in the country was 2,906, but many have been forced to go online or have closed shop because of falling circulation. In a telephonic conversation, Sham Dass Khanna, news editor, Hind Samachar, the number one Urdu daily in Punjab, said, “The situation is alarming. From 1,20,000 copies per day until the 1990s, our circulation has come down to 37,000 copies per day. Our readers are disappearing because Urdu does not promise career options.”

Measures needed

In order to improve the condition of Urdu, Dr Nadeem Ahmed Nadeem, who conducts certificate and diploma courses in Urdu and Persian at Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, Fatehgarh Sahib, says: “We plan to start special classes for students who are doing post-graduation and doctorate in Punjabi because there is a close relationship between Punjabi and Urdu. The knowledge of Urdu is important even for religious studies because the poetry of Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Gobind Singh is replete with Persian words and phrases.” Urdu is the language of Punjabi culture because it was born in Punjab, observes Dr Nadeem. “It is essential to learn Urdu, because once you learn how to read and write it, doors open to eight languages because they all used the same script. These languages are: Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Kashmiri, Pashtu, Dogri, Sindhi, and also Punjabi because in Pakistan, it is written in the Persian script. If you examine Punjabi and Urdu, you will notice that there are so many similarities. For example, chhabeel comes from the Arabic word sabeel; ardas comes from arz-e-dash.” Dr Mohammad Ayyub Khan, programme in-charge, Haryana Urdu Akademi, points out the practical problems in the propagation of Urdu: “There is an acute shortage of teachers. At Panjab University, Punjabi University, Guru Nanak Dev University, and Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, they have appointed only one Urdu teacher, and this one teacher runs the entire department. How can they do justice to their jobs? In MA classes, we have eight subjects, so we need at least four Urdu teachers. It is not that there are no posts, but I fail to understand why these are not being filled up. It is not that the government is not giving funds to promote the language; the funds are not being properly utilised.” Muhammad Rafique, lecturer, political science at Government Senior Secondary School (Boys), Malerkotla, says: “A team from Delhi came here to study the status of Urdu in this tehsil, and they gave a good report about it. They said, in other states, about 1,200 Urdu teachers have been appointed but their output is very poor. We have only 45 teachers, but their output is tremendous.” Sahibzada Ajmal Khan Sherwani, a poet belonging to the royal family, suggests that if we want people to learn Urdu, we must produce excellent literature, films, TV serials and plays in Urdu. We see that the rise or downfall of a language is directly linked to the rise or downfall of its literature. “Urdu is very popular, and one of the reasons is the extensive use of Urdu in the film industry. Another reason for its popularity is various TV channels that telecast Urdu programmes, serials, seminars, and mushairas. In addition to this, the government must open more institutes and encourage students to learn it in schools and colleges so that great writers and poets are produced.” Speaking of Urdu, he wrote a verse: “Hoon main Urdu, hai dilon mei mera maskan dekho; Kaun kehta hai ki meri koi jagir nahin” (I am Urdu, and my abode is in the hearts of people, Who says that I have no legacy?). The legacy of Zauk, Sauda, Momin, Iqbal, Hali, Faraz and others is alive indeed in the hearts of the masses."
The Tribune: Movie Reviews,"Nonika Singh

As the trailers have already revealed, Jab Harry Met Sejal begins on a rather peculiar, almost absurd, note. She has lost her engagement ring, he is going about his life of a tourist guide with business as usual. She seeks, nay forces, herself on him to make her find the lost ring. That’s how Harry and Sejal truly meet, not the most romantic setting and certainly not a revelation when the rest of the film unfolds.

An old fashioned love story rarely packs any surprises, we agree but it does get its love potion right. Trust Imitaz Ali, the love balladeer of modern day romance, to show you the deeper shade of love by cutting across the class and caste divide. Why, he turns around the notion of romance on its head too. Is romance going down on your knees and proposing to your beloved or is it an emotion that emanates from the deepest recess of your heart?

Imitaz often takes us where we can plumb the depths of love and our own hearts through its lovelorn lovers who find themselves through love. The point is does he manage to do the same with his latest offering? The answer sadly is only intermittently, in flashes.

With the Badshah of romance, Shah Rukh Khan, at the helm, you do expect many a moment that will make you go weak in the knees. If you are a true blue SRK fan, he does not disappoint and makes your heart somersault with his adaa, that inimitable look and more. There are no doubts about his charisma or Anushka’s acting capability, who plays the bindass Gujarati lass so well that you are tempted to hum Dil le gai kudi Gujarat di.

Imitaz’s women characters are well rounded and so seems Sejal. But strangely enough she goes all over Europe literally scrounging for the ring.

Yes, indeed, ring is a metaphor for what we seek within us. But in telling this story of lost and found, it tries too hard to be love wise. Certainly love completes us. But there are forced interjections riding on a skeletal storyline that dull your senses rather than filling you with that loving feeling. Within the beauteous environs of Europe, a gifted superstar Shah Rukh Khan and a talented young actor Anushka do keep you engaged. For the first half at least there is some mirth and a fine pace. Thereafter SRK fan or not, it becomes hard to flow with the path the lovers follow.

The template of Imtiaz’s previous films trails this one but with little force and impact. Remember the passionate kiss of Jab We Met? Well, here too love is sealed in a similar fashion. Only Jab Harry Met Sejal isn’t the rollicking ride of Jab We Met which per se isn’t a bad thing. For no two films are meant to be so, only it makes you so wish it were.

This might be Imtiaz Ali’s brand of love as SRK and Anushka have said, only it’s not even half as flavoursome or soulful as his previous outings. A love story that doesn’t make your heart sing and soul soar can hardly be an affair worth remembering. So much so even the delectable song Hawayein written by Irshad Kaamil and composed by Pritam gets lost and can’t hold love in the air."

Ludhiana, August 6

After incidents of braid cutting reported in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and in some parts of Punjab, Ludhiana has also witnessed four such incidents. In all these incidents, the women complained of their hair being chopped off mysteriously. One of the victims alleged her hair were chopped off by a cat while she was sitting on the rooftop of her house.

In one of the incidents, the police have registered a case under section 295 of the IPC against unknown persons. Although no proof of any specific person’s role has been found in the incidents, there is panic among residents.

In the first incident, Jaspreet Kaur of Captain Colony in the Meharban area alleged that yesterday, she was alone at her grocery store. At 9.30 pm, she started feeling that someone was pressing her shoulder and in a few seconds, she felt unconscious. In the meantime, a customer arrived there and raised the alarm. “When I woke up, I found my hair chopped. Those were lying nearby. I did not notice any person entering my shop. It seemed some supernatural power possessed me and chopped off my hair,” she alleged.

Meharban SHO Pavitar Singh said since the woman did not notice anybody entering her shop and chopping off her hair, the police had registered a case against unknown persons. Footage of CCTV cameras installed in the area would be scanned.

In the Basti Jodhewal area, Resham Kumari (57), a resident of Ram Nagar, alleged that on Friday night, she, along with her son, slept in the room. When she woke up in the morning, she found her hair chopped. “I was stunned to see a bunch of hair lying near to my bed. Neither my son nor I opened the door the whole night, still the mysterious thing happened,” the woman told the police.

In yet another incident, a 25-year-old married woman, Zainab, from Guru Gobind Nagar, said she was sitting on the third floor of her house last afternoon when she noticed that a cat arrived there, cut her hair and vanished. Basti Jodhewal SHO Vijay Kumar said the police had not received any complaint from the woman. “We visited localities as people were feeling panicky. I talked to both women. They refused to file any complaint. Still, the police are verifying the matter,” he added.

On Saturday, Paramjit Kaur (55) of Mullanpur village had alleged that an unidentified man chopped off her braid in the afternoon. She was in the kitchen when a man with his face covered climbed the boundary wall and barged into the house. He chopped off her braid with a large shear which is used to trim hedges. The woman alleged that before cutting her braid, the man asked her who did her family vote for in the last Assembly elections. A case under Section 323, 452 and 295, IPC, has been registered."

Toronto

Opioid prescription use is more common in cancer survivors than in individuals without a history of the disease, a study led by an Indian origin scientist has found.

Researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada found that the rate of opioid prescribing was 1.22 times higher among cancer survivors than corresponding matched controls.

""Our research findings raise concerns about the diagnosis and management of chronic pain problems among survivors stemming from their cancer diagnosis or treatment,"" said Rinku Sutradhar, associate professor at University of Toronto.

Over a 36-month period, the average number of opioid prescriptions filled by survivors was 7.7, compared with 6.3 for controls.

This increased rate of opioid prescribing was also seen among survivors who were 10 or more years past their cancer diagnosis, researchers said.

Individuals with lower income, and those who were younger, from rural neighbourhood's, and with more comorbidities had significantly higher prescribing rates. Sex was not associated with prescribing rates, they said.

""Physicians providing primary care to cancer survivors should consider close examination of reasons for continued opioid use to differentiate chronic pain from dependency,"" Sutradhar added.

The study was published in the journal Cancer. —PTI"
It hit the fan long back,"BOOK REVIEW: POST-TRUTH: WHY WE HAVE REACHED PEAK BULLSHIT AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT BY EVAN DAVIS.

Man has always lied, evaded, cheated, misstated and concealed. What seems to have changed is the intensity with which post-truth is being bandied about. This is because there are no gatekeepers on the social media where truth and falsehood get equal billing

Sandeep Dikshit

A decade back, the word ‘bullshit’ would have appeared in print with asterisks blanking out the last four alphabets. Today, it is part of the title of three books released in quick succession. But we could be groping about something that was in existence since millennia, but has now acquired epidemic proportions. The burden of Evans’ song is that the phenomena of post-truth, which is colloquially called bullshit, reared its head in 2016.

What follows is intensive groundwork into all shades of post-truth defined as an assertion or claim whose owners neither know nor care whether what they say is true or false as long as their interests are met by fooling the gullible. The claim about its emergence in 2016 has to be held in abeyance. Cast a look at the past like Mark Antony’s speech at Caesar’s funeral over 2,000 years back. Or the US-UK disinformation over Iraq followed by further dissembling by not acknowledging the war’s consequences such as the breakup of the country and the fresh wind it gave to the ideology of violent Islamism.

Post-truth has been with us all the while in all its forms. The beauty of this book is in breaking it down and presenting the infinite variants of lying through the teeth: nonsense and gibberish (generally benign); gestures and phony behaviour (think Trump, Modi, Lalu Prasad Yadav); hidden messages (linguistic contortions) and short-termism (spouting exaggeration and lies to achieve an immediate aim).

It appears that things have been the same since kingdom come. Man has always lied, evaded, cheated, misstated and concealed. What seems to have changed is the intensity with which post-truth is being bandied about. This is because there are no gatekeepers on the social media where truth and falsehood get equal billing. There has been another significant change: the arrival of Donald Trump with his alluring mix of political lies, spin and falsehood. Just like academics treat September 11, 2001 (not 9-11) attacks as the day terrorism emerged, authors in the western world believe that post-truth is linked to the previous US presidential elections.

That is why, for those not plugged into the internal circuitry of the power play in the US, the UK and, to a lesser extent, some obscure parts and people of Europe, the examples cited in the book are a big yawn for people in other parts of the globe. The examples have been painstakingly collated, assembled and distributed, but the net is not wide enough. It would have been more appealing had Davis not focused only on the Blairs and the Trumps, but spoken about their peers elsewhere — Shinzo Abe, Nawaz Sharif, Robert Duterte, Thaksin Shinawatra, Jacob Zuma and, our very own, Narendra Modi.

Nor are we told how the western media sets the pace and dominates the narrative on contentious issues where the self interest of its home country takes precedence. We, in the developing world, are frequently shushed into an uncomfortable silence with the avalanche of post-truth that descends from western TV channels and newspapers. The South China Sea is a prime example. A close reading of the occupation of those islands would show that the first stone in the sea was not cast by China. The first runway built on these islands or the first fortification was also not by China but by a clutch of countries that thrive under the shield of the American military umbrella.

What is the solution? It is natural that Evans will falter since his work is based on a partial study of post-truth. He has to, therefore, fall back on positivism and state that, in the end, good sense should prevail. If only life had a Bollywood-style happy ending."

CJM seeks report on rotten wheat dump,"Our Correspondent

Tarn Taran, August 6 Sumit Bhalla, Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), has ordered the office of the local Deputy Commissioner to submit a report over the unhygienic conditions created due to the heap of rotten wheat stock lying in the open at Piddi village. The CJM has also directed the local SHO Sadar police to conduct an inquiry under Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Both authorities have been directed to submit their report within 10 days. The court has passed the orders on the complaint of Buta Singh Sandhu, joint secretary, District Bar Association, lodged under Sections 268, 269, 270, 272, 284 and 291 of the IPC last week. Buta Singh said the stock belonging to Pungrain (Punjab Grains Procurement Corporation Limited) was lying in the open and had been causing pollution in the area for the past few years. Accusing Pungrain officials of negligence, he said the dump had turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies, besides snakes and other reptiles. He said the dump, located a few metres from the judicial court complex and the district administrative complex, had adversely affected the health of a number of local residents. Navdeep Singh, Assistant Food and Supply Officer, said the department had initiated the process to call tenders to lift the stock of rotten wheat."
Guard against water damage,"HOME TRUTHS

Saurabh Agarwal

The arrival of monsoon is a welcome respite from the summer heat. But on the flip side, the wet spell is also associated with leaking roofs, seepage, and in some cases, collapse of buildings due to structural failure. It is a false notion that little can be done to prevent water-related issues once a structure has been constructed. Now, a range of products are easily available in the market that can ensure maximum protection from water damage right in the beginning at the construction phase, and even as an after-construction solution to protect homes and buildings. Read on to get a better understanding of the underlying causes of the problem and the range of remedies and solutions available to effectively address the problem at hand:

What causes water damage

Shoddy construction and use of sub-standard materials can cause cracks and crevices in concrete structures that allow water to penetrate. These are not just an eye-sore aesthetically, but also pose a hazard to the structural strength of the building. Identifying the root cause and prompt corrective measures to deal with any seepage or leakage is important to prevent the problem from worsening.

Installing drainage system and maintaining it is the first logical step that must be undertaken from the construction phase itself. A proper drainage system must, therefore, be installed on priority basis if your home doesn’t have one.

Awareness is the key to prevention

As the saying goes — A stitch in time saves nine. Thus, following basic principles of water proofing at relevant stages of construction is a sure shot way of ensuring a water-proof structure that stands the test of time. Design and construction elements to mitigate the danger at the design stage, provision for effective drainage systems, use of suitable materials such as bitumen or silicone-based water proofing systems in terrace and walls along with water repellant paints and emulsions are also effective in the fight against seepage, leakage and dampness.

For new constructions, admixtures, plasticisers and integral water-proofing compounds are available to provide an effective barrier against water from cutting through concrete. These can be conveniently built-in when constructing structures like foundation and retaining walls in basement, wet areas (toilet, balcony and kitchen), terrace, overhead and underground tanks, swimming pools, podium slab etc.

For the water-proofing solutions to be effective, critical components of the structure such as block walls and underground foundation need to be in top shape.

Solutions to check out

There are several corrective measures that can be adopted as per the problem and structural composition of the building.

Liquid waterproofing is generally adopted for concrete and plasters. This innovative waterproofing solution acts as a tonic for cement and can be applied from the foundation to the roof of the building. This cement additive is specially formulated to increase the life span of buildings by preventing the development of cracks thereby preventing leakage and rusting.

Water proofing compounds are increasingly becoming popular not only as a deterrent to water ingress but also as an aid for healthy construction, emulsion and protective coatings to limit the effect of vagaries of weather on buildings.

Five water proofing solutions that are currently preferred are:

Conventional systems would include box-type water proofing with impervious stone slabs.

Crystalline waterproofing systems and flexible membrane water proofing systems involve application of chemicals on the surface of concrete.

Chemical coatings react with the soft by-products of the cement hydration process and form hard crystals. These crystals lodge themselves in the concrete pores, thereby making it impervious.

Water-repellant impregnates are silicones which due to their low-viscosity impart repellant property to the surface on application.

"Gatlin win not the perfect script, says IAAF president Coe","LONDON, August 6

Justin Gatlin’s win in the 100 metres at the World Championships was “not the perfect script”, IAAF president Sebastian Coe said on Sunday. American Gatlin, who has served two suspensions for doping offences, ruined Usain Bolt’s fairytale farewell on Saturday by beating the Jamaican sprint great in his final ever individual race. “I’m not eulogistic that someone who has served two bans has walked off with one of our glittering prizes. But he is eligible to be here,” Coe, the head of the sport’s governing body, said. “It’s not the perfect script. I thought Usain was very generous with the observations he made. That must have been a bitter event for him to swallow. He was bigger than the moment and it typifies his career.” Coe reiterated his support for life bans for convicted drug cheats, but used Gatlin’s example to illustrate how legal systems worldwide have frustrated efforts to impose more severe punishments. Gatlin received a two-year ban in 2001 after failing a dope test for amphetamines found in prescribed medication he had been taking since a child for Attention Deficit Disorder. This suspension was later reduced to one year on appeal. The sprinter then tested positive for testosterone in 2006 and was suspended for eight years, avoiding a lifetime ban in exchange for his cooperation with the doping authorities. This ban, however, was also halved by an arbitration panel in 2007. “There have been two bans in the past,” Coe said. “One got watered down, which made it very difficult for the second ban. The second ban, we went for an eight-year ban, which would have, in essence, been a life ban. We lost that.” Efforts to impose lengthy suspensions on doping offenders have often been overturned in courts or by arbitration panels, with appeals sometimes citing inconsistencies with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) code. WADA only updated its code from January 2015 to allow a four-year ban for first-time offenders, up from two years. Following Gatlin’s victory, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness said he wanted lifetime bans introduced to fully eradicate doping. “So would I (like to see lifetime bans) and so would the majority of our sport,” Coe said. “I’m not going to close the door on lifetime bans but we’ve constantly tried it and lost it.” — Reuters"
Use of swear words increasing in American literature: study,"Los Angeles, August 7

There has been a steady increase in the use of swear words in American literature, according to a study which found that books today are 28 times more likely to contain offensive language than in the 1950s. “The increases in swear words in books is part of a larger cultural trend towards individualism and free expression,” said Jean M Twenge, professor at San Diego State University in the US. Researchers analysed the textual content from tens of thousands of books published between 1950 and 2008, and that have been catalogued by the Google Books database. They searched for instances of seven swear words. They found a steadily rising trend of such words appearing in the books. In total, American authors used the seven risque words 28 times more often in the mid-2000s than the early 1950s, according to the study published in the journal SAGE Open. They suggest that these words have become much less taboo over time. One interpretation is that people today value free expression more than they did several decades ago, researchers said. That dovetails with previous research which has found that American society is becoming increasingly individualistic. That characteristic is especially prominent in young people, Twenge said. “Millennials have a ‘come as you are’ philosophy, and this study shows one of the ways they got it: The culture has shifted towards more free self-expression,” she said.

At 6 Maulana Azad Road….,"Harish Khare

Y

ESTERDAY, an election was held to decide the new occupant of 6 Maulana Azad Road in New Delhi. This house is the designated residence for the Vice-President of India. The great scholar, freedom fighter, and educationist, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad lived at this address from 1947 till his death in 1958. Till then, the street was called King Edward Road. After the Maulana’s departure, it came to be known as Maulana Azad Road. Hamid Ansari has lived in this modest but elegant residence for the longest time — 10 years. That is not surprising because he is only the second person in our history to have served two terms as Vice-President. The first one, Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, lived a part of his tenures at York Road (now Moti Lal Nehru Road). 6 Maulana Azad has had an interesting procession of occupants, and each one of them probably left an imprint on it. Curiously, there was a mosque in the premises, and then a temple got added. But perhaps the most significant addition that got made was during the stay of KR Narayanan. Soon after that horrible day, December 6, 1992, when our very constitutional order came under severe assault, Vice-President Narayanan bought two paintings, both of the Mahatma. The paintings show the Mahatma in a pensive mood, and each lends a certain spiritual charm to the surroundings. One of the paintings that Narayanan bought hangs in the Chairman’s office in the Parliament House, and the other adorns the wall above the mantle-piece in the drawing room at 6, Maulana Road. None of Narayanan’s successors felt the need to tinker with the arrangement. It would be interesting to know if Hamid Ansari’s successor has different thoughts and ideas and whether the Mahatma retains his place at the Vice-President’s residence. For 10 years, Hamid Ansari made a model and dignified resident at 6, Maulana Azad Road. His presence in the second highest constitutional office of the land showcased the best of Indian plurality and diversity. But these last three years, he was seen as an incongruity. This incongruity got symbolised by his choice of sherwani as the formal dress. More than the choice of attire, Hamid sahib was the odd man out. After all, he is a man of ideas, a man who values and reads books, feels at home in the company of the educated. He is familiar with the history of our region and beyond; and, more importantly, he has a sense of history. A Vice-President has just about no power. But that does not prevent an incumbent from speaking out on issues of national and international importance. Hamid Ansari made his erudite presence felt often. He spoke out against the creeping culture of intolerance and intimidation. Hamid Ansari’s gentle, dignified presence at the pulpit must have been an eyesore to the new congregation of the closed minds. Now, with a new occupant at 6 Maulana Azad Road, the ruling establishment will have one less irritant to deal with.

T is almost a cliché for our leaders to extol the virtues of “dialogue” even when they continue to talk down to others, that is, when they are not shouting at their adversaries. Much of our public discourse has become a dialogue of the deaf. I say my piece, you say your piece and we put the onus on the other person to try to understand me. Neither of us wants to listen and appreciate the other’s point of view. We are happy with our prejudices and contented with our sense of superior wisdom. We accuse the others of intolerance and, worse, of bigotry. Try listening. That is Arun Maira’s mantra in this very, very readable book, Listening for Well-Being — Conversations with People Not Like Us. Arun Maira is not a “things-to-do” guru and this is not the kind of books that are displayed prominently at airport bookstores. He is a serious student of public policy and for five years, between 2009 and 2014, he was a member of the Planning Commission. In a brief foreword to this book, the Dalai Lama notes that along with contemplating and meditating, listening is one of the three “wisdom tools.” This means listening “without preconceived notion and with respect and full attention” to what others say. Another Buddhist sage, Thich Nhat Hanh, has exhorted us: “To know how to love someone, we have to understand them. To understand, we need to listen.” The book is a rather thoughtful reflection on inadequacies we have injected in our collective affairs, especially with the arrival of social media. The new tools of social media only help us reinforce our prejudices and passions and we end up creating more and more ugliness around us. Our failure to listen — rather our refusal to listen to those who are not like us — is producing great social disharmony, endangering our security. Our politics, our media, and our national discourse end up creating noxious bitterness. Arun Maira ends the book with a simple reminder that we all like to pose ourselves a question: “What sort of a world are we leaving behind for our grandchildren?” This question has become a cliché. Yet, the question remains urgent and relevant. Therefore, while we do listen to our own aspirations, “we must also listen to the aspirations of people not like us for the better world they want to leave for their grandchildren.” Well put.

UST when we thought that everybody was succumbing to a creeping madness, there emerges evidence of sanity. The evidence has a name: Additional Sessions Judge Sidharth Sharma. It appears that Judge Sidharth Sharma had before him the case of Kashmiri ‘separatist’ leader Shabir Shah, who has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate for possessing undisclosed foreign funds. The Enforcement Directorate’s lawyer challengingly asked Mr Shah to chant Bharat Mata Ki Jai in order to prove his innocence and his patriotism. Judge Sidharth Sharma correctly and promptly intervened and ticked off the lawyer that the courtroom was not a “television studio.” Judge Sidharth Sharma’s rebuke for the ED was not at all out of place; indeed, it was way overdue. It is bad enough that our political leaders use the courts to settle scores with their rivals, it a double tragedy that some lawyers have come to believe that a “cause” takes precedence over the law and etiquettes and protocols of the courtroom. “Patriotism” and “nationalism” are the two latest “causes” which excite a section of lawyers who take it upon themselves to pronounce a person guilty or innocent. This unfortunate trend, in fact, was first noticed in Srinagar where a very vociferous bar association has virtually rendered the courts of law defunct. Our nation faces many grave challenges but none of these challenges would be defused by resorting to extra-legal tactics or reducing our judicial process to a “kangaroo court.”

am impressed with the tagline in the Haryana Government’s publicity campaign on the completion of its 1,000 days in office. There is a rather clever play on words in the Chief Minister’s name to produce the ‘raj manohar’ slogan. This is very creative ad work. In the process, it need be noted that Manohar Lal, perhaps, becomes the first major BJP functionary in the Age of Modi to be allowed a spot of self-glorification. So far, this trick has been reserved for the Prime Minister. The chief minister is too self-effacing to be suspected of wanting to promote a personality cult and let us hope that the commissars in Delhi do not take a different view. Till then, let me raise my cup of coffee to Manohar Lal’s creative team. Join me.

It is after a gap of about two decades that a contest is happening in Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat, where official nominees of major parties used to get elected unopposed, after the BJP fielded a Congress rebel against Patel, who is seeking a fifth term.

The ruling BJP has fielded party chief Amit Shah, Union minister Smriti Irani, and Balwantsinh Rajput, who till recently was Congress' chief whip in the House, for the three RS seats.

While its first two candidates will sail through, the BJP will have to manage extra votes to enable Rajput beat Patel.

Ahmed Patel, who met Congress MLAs after they returned from their Bengaluru sojourn, said he was confident of his victory.

“This poll is not at all about anyone's prestige. I have full faith in my MLAs. Apart from these 44 (Congress) legislators, two of NCP, one of JD-U would vote for me,"" Patel told reporters.

These MLAs have now been hosted at a resort in Anand district.

The Congress, which has been out of power in the state for over a decade-and-a-half now, was rattled by the surprise exit of party stalwart Shankarsinha Vaghela recently.

It was jolted further when its six MLAs, including Rajput, a relative of Vaghela resigned from the Assembly.

Three of them later joined BJP, setting off alarm bells in the party in Gujarat where Assembly elections are due later this year. The beleaguered Congress flew its 44 MLAs to Bengaluru to ward off any threat of ""poaching"" by the BJP.

However, six of the 51 MLAs still in the Congress, apart from Vaghela, have not put their cards on the table. They were not among the MLAs packed off to Bengaluru.

Vaghela, who resigned from the party and as the leader of the opposition, has not quit the House yet, giving the Congress a major cause for worry.

The Congress had faced a major embarrassment in the presidential election when joint opposition candidate Meira Kumar could manage 49 votes when the party's strength then was 57.

A candidate will require 45 votes for a straight win in the poll, and the BJP with 121 MLAs can secure easy victories for Shah and Irani. The party will be left with 31 surplus votes for Rajput, who will require the backing of rebel MLAs of the Congress and smaller parties to win.

For now, Ahmed Patel looks like having the clear backing of 44 Congress MLAs, but even if none of them cross-votes or uses NOTA (None of the Above) option, the Congress candidate will require one additional vote for his victory.

The Congress is also banking on the support of two NCP MLAs, and one each of JD(U) and Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP).

However, NCP leader Praful Patel yesterday said his party had not yet made up its mind on whom to support. The NCP and JD(U) MLAs had accompanied Patel when he filed his nomination.

JD(U) MLA Chotubhai Vasava has been saying he will only support those who will give something to his constituency.

Keeping his cards close to chest, Vaghela today chose to maintain silence on his choice of candidate for the Rajya Sabha polls, but said Congress nominee Ahmed Patel remained a ""friend”.

""Each and every voter is the owner of his vote. The vote is the personal property of an MLA (for the RS polls).

Therefore, I do not want to reveal whom I will vote for,"" Vaghela told reporters.

The 77-year-old veteran said he was no longer in touch with the Congress and dismissed the talk that he was in contact with the BJP.

According to Election Commission officials, a candidate would require one-fourth of the total number of votes plus one to get elected. This would mean a contestant has to muster 45 votes.

The MLAs have to give their preferential votes indicating first choice, second, third, fourth (as per number of candidates) or they can choose NOTA, they said.

Meanwhile, Amit Shah, who has helmed the party to spectacular victories in several elections since 2014, is camping in Gujarat strategising on how to get all three BJP nominees win. — PTI"

Amritsar, August 6

The consumer forum has directed an insurance company to pay Rs 10 lakh to Brightway Constructions, an employee of which had died last year in a mishap at a construction site. The employee was insured but the firm had refused to pay. Besides, the construction company has been asked that the money, after being received, should be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased.

The Brightway Constructions was engaged by the Punjab Tourism Promotion Board for the renovation of historic Gobindgarh Fort in the city. Its employee Jethu Ram died in a mishap on April 23, 2016. The firm, in its complaint filed against the United India Insurance Company, stated that the insurance cover was valid from June 16, 2015 to June 15, 2016. When the claim was filed, the insurer repudiated it claiming that the policy did not cover risk.

The opposite party, in its reply, stated that an officer of the company inadvertently mentioned “death to employee of the contractor and other people/public” in the column of ‘personal injury or death’. It further stated that in the same cover note in special-condition column, it was mentioned that this cover note was as per the policy terms and conditions. The reply stated that terms and conditions were dispatched to the policy holder on October 16, 2015.

The forum observed that the opposite party couldn’t escape from its liability to pay the claim on the ground that the concerned officer inadvertently issued the policy to the complainant. The forum also stated that the complainant had denied having received any terms and conditions document and the opposite party had failed to rebut the claim as it had not produced on record any postal receipt regarding the dispatch of the policy as well as terms and conditions to the complainant.

While directing the company to pay the claim of Rs 10 lakh, it has also instructed it to pay Rs 3,000 as compensation for harassment and Rs 2,000 as litigation expenses."
The day of the ‘nodder’,"Vivek Atray

Vivek Atray

PG Wodehouse was always ahead of his time. And when he introduced the breed of 'nodders' in a classic short story based on Hollywood's goings-on in the 1920s, he broke the mould. The very concept of engaging a man who would nod vigorously at the exact moment in a meeting when the engager needed him to nod was innovative to say the least. In fact the masterful Wodehouse had not just the nodder in the employment of the protagonist, but also two others who would go on saying ‘yes’ and were officially designated as ‘Yes Men’. The three of them would ensure that all present invariably agreed with their boss. They would become so animated in agreement with his proposals to the House that only a real brave-heart would vote against them. Indeed, the nod has forever been a universally accepted sign of acquiescence. But the meaning of the unique 'nod' that many residents of South India bestow upon the onlooker is forever a matter of conjecture. It is a wavy, curvy, sort of nod, and could actually be a shake of the head, thus signifying a 'No', but one is never sure! In current times, ‘nodders’ and even clappers have become almost indispensible. It is a known fact that a politician will engage the services of motley persons in the audience to cheer and clap at given intervals in his speech. Unfortunately for our enterprising leader, the opposite is also true and a rival will often employ 'disrupters' to jeer him loudly! One ‘nodder’ had a tough time after a recent meeting though. He nodded so vigorously for over an hour that he had to apply all sorts of balms to heal his aching neck later. It is reliably learnt that he has engaged the services of a professional trainer to train him how to nod properly during the next few decades of his career, without causing permanent physical damage. And a young suitor still waits breathlessly for the shy nod of his beloved when he pops the question, although these days shy nods are said to be out of fashion! As a young officer in charge of a public auction years ago, I noticed another sort of nod. A grim-faced local heavyweight was present with his cronies and would nod ever so slightly each time he wanted to raise the bid. His chief crony would then announce loud and clear what the ‘boss’ wanted. The philosophical reader may surmise that he would have done better in life had he nodded more often at his boss instead of putting his foot down. Be that as it may, his firmness probably gave him much sounder sleep over the years than would have his sycophancy. Clearly though, the professional ‘nodder’ is here to stay. He may even stand a chance of nodding his way to the 'nodders' hall of fame one day, but only if he gets the nod from the powers-that-be!"
Australia’s ruling party meets to resolve gay marriage rift,"Canberra, August 7

Australia’s ruling party will attempt to resolve bitter internal differences over gay marriage at a special meeting on Monday aimed at containing a rift that threatens the prime minister’s leadership. Finding policy agreement on the issue is a test of prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s authority over his government, which has trailed the centre-left opposition Labour Party for months in opinion polls. The conservative Liberal Party-led coalition was narrowly re-elected at elections in July last year with a promise to let voters decide whether Australia should recognise same-sex marriage through a popular vote. But the Senate would not allow the so-called plebiscite, which would have cost 160 million Australian dollars (USD 127 million) and the result could have been ignored by lawmakers when deciding how to vote on gay marriage legislation in the Parliament. Liberal Sen Dean Smith, a gay man who opposed legalising same-sex marriage when he was appointed to the Senate in 2012, has drafted a bill to allow gay marriage now and wants his fellow Liberal lawmakers to be allowed to vote on it according to their consciences rather than to according to party policy. “It’s time for the party to put the matter to rest once and for all,” Smith told reporters on Monday. Gay marriage opponents, including former Prime Minister Tony Abbott who initiated the plebiscite policy two year ago, argue that the government must stick to its election promise that marriage law would not be changed without a national vote. “The last thing Australia needs is government by opinion poll,” Abbott wrote in The Australian newspaper. “But neither do we need political parties that believe one thing one minute and the opposite the next,” he added. Other lawmakers have proposed a postal plebiscite in which voters mailed in their opinions instead of using ballot boxes as a cheaper option that would not need the Senate to approve the expense. Opponents argue that the postal option would also need Senate approval and have warned of a court challenge. Gay marriage campaigner Anna Brown said her advocacy group The Equality Campaign would seek a High Court injunction to prevent any postal plebiscite. “The government needs to think very carefully before it expends up to AU$100 million of taxpayer dollars when it could resolve this issue in Parliament as soon as this week,” Brown said. Smith’s supporters could present his gay marriage bill to Parliament this week, regardless of his party’s policy decision on Monday. Turnbull’s coalition has a single-seat majority in the House of Representatives, where the political leader who controls a majority becomes prime minister. So a few lawmakers deserting the ruling party on gay marriage could leave the government powerless to block the bill. Liberal lawmaker Eric Abetz, who opposes gay marriage, said that would be a “grave matter” that showed the government had lost control of its legislative priorities. AP"

Cong facing serious crisis: Jairam Ramesh,"Kochi, August 7

The Congress is facing an ""existential crisis"", senior party leader Jairam Ramesh today said and pitched for ""a collective effort"" by party leaders to ""overcome"" the challenges it faced from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah.

(Follow

; and

)

Ramesh also said business as usual approach will not work against Modi and Shah and advocated for a flexibility in approach to make Congress relevant.

""Yes, the Congress party is facing a very serious crisis,"" Ramesh told PTI in an interview.

He said the Congress had faced ""electoral crisis"" from 1996 to 2004 when it was out of power. The party had also faced ""electoral crisis"" in 1977 when it lost the elections held soon after the emergency.

""But today, I would say that the Congress is facing an existential crisis. It is not an electoral crisis. The party really is in deep crisis,"" he said, when asked whether the threat of ""poaching"" of MLAs posed by the BJP in Gujarat had forced the party to transport its MLAs to Karnataka to ensure party leader Ahmed Patel's victory in the Rajya Sabha polls.

He, however, justified the Gujarat Congress's decision to send 44 of its MLAs to a resort in party-ruled Karnataka on July 29 to fend off the alleged ""poaching"" attempts by BJP, saying the saffron party had also ""transported"" MLAs in the past.

He said it was wrong for the Congress party to think that anti-incumbency will work automatically against the Modi-led government in the states being ruled by the BJP in the elections.

""We have to understand we are up against Mr Modi, Mr Shah. And they think differently, they act differently, and if we are not flexible in our approach, we will become irrelevant, frankly,"" the Congress leader said.

He said the Congress party must also recognise that India has changed. ""Old slogans don't work, old formulas don't work, old mantras don't work. India has changed, the Congress party has to change,"" he said.

The former union minister hoped that party vice-president Rahul Gandhi would end the uncertainty over his taking over as the Congress president to make the party ready for crucial electoral battles in key states in 2018 and the Lok Sabha polls scheduled a year later.

""I think in all probability, Rahul Gandhi will take charge (as Congress president) before the end of 2017,"" he said.

The senior leader lamented that he had been proved wrong in the past about his prediction about Rahul's assuming charge of the top party job.

""I thought it will happen in 2015, it didn't happen. I thought it will happen in 2016, it didn't happen. So I am the wrong person to ask this question. I feel that it may happen before the end of 2017,"" Ramesh said.

He said he had ""no"" indication about appointment of Rahul Gandhi as Congress president.

""I have only expectation. That's all. In 2018 and 2019 you will be busy with elections. State elections, national elections...and this type of thing...uncertainty is not good,"" he said and urged the Gandhi scion to ""finish it off.""

Asked if there is anyone in the Congress party to give a strong challenge to Modi in 2019 elections, Ramesh said, ""I have always maintained that it is the collective strength of the Congress that will overcome Mr Modi not some individual magic wand.”

""It has to be a collective effort,"" he said.

Ramesh took potshots at party leaders who still behave as if the party is still in power.

“The sultanate has gone, but we behave as if we are sultans still. We have to completely redo the way of thinking, the way of acting, the way of projecting, the way of communicating.

“I think there is a lot of goodwill for the Congress, a lot of support for the Congress but people want to see a new Congress. They don't want to see old mantras, old slogans. We must recognise this is a big challenge. Huge challenge for us,"" he said.

He said Nitish Kumar's return to the NDA fold was a big setback for anti-BJP coalition in the country, describing it as a ""completely betrayal of the mandate"" given to the Mahagathbandhan by the people of Bihar.

Ramesh, who shares a personal rapport with Kumar, said, ""personally, I was aghast, astonished, deeply disappointed, but we have to move on and we don't have time.""

Ramesh, representing Karnataka in the Rajya Sabha, expressed hope that the ""revival"" of Congress will happen in Karnataka next year as it had happened 40 years ago in 1978 in Chikmagalur Lok Sabha seat in the state which gave political rebirth to Indira Gandhi who faced defeat in Rae Bareli in the elections held after the Emergency. — PTI"

Toronto

Opioid prescription use is more common in cancer survivors than in individuals without a history of the disease, a study led by an Indian origin scientist has found.

Researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada found that the rate of opioid prescribing was 1.22 times higher among cancer survivors than corresponding matched controls.

""Our research findings raise concerns about the diagnosis and management of chronic pain problems among survivors stemming from their cancer diagnosis or treatment,"" said Rinku Sutradhar, associate professor at University of Toronto.

Over a 36-month period, the average number of opioid prescriptions filled by survivors was 7.7, compared with 6.3 for controls.

This increased rate of opioid prescribing was also seen among survivors who were 10 or more years past their cancer diagnosis, researchers said.

Individuals with lower income, and those who were younger, from rural neighbourhood's, and with more comorbidities had significantly higher prescribing rates. Sex was not associated with prescribing rates, they said.

""Physicians providing primary care to cancer survivors should consider close examination of reasons for continued opioid use to differentiate chronic pain from dependency,"" Sutradhar added.

The study was published in the journal Cancer. —PTI"

Centre, Punjab again caught in food procurement mess

Also in this section

Honourable Venkaiah Naidu

PICTURES of grains rotting in rain are regularly splashed in the media but these have ceased to evoke a sense of shock or outrage and produce predictable official reaction. A CAG report tabled in Parliament on Friday has studied the Central scheme to augment storage capacity between 2011 and 2016 and pointed to a Rs 700-crore grain loss in Punjab. For cereals at least there is some system in place for procurement and storage, even if it is highly inefficient and corrupt. For other farm products such as fruits and vegetables there is no proper supply chain, private or public. As a result, up to 30 per cent fruits and vegetables go waste. Malnutrition is rampant in the country because of high prices of food. A lot of physical effort, water, soil nutrients and capital go into producing every crop. All that come to naught because a handful of officials cannot do the job they are paid for. It is a criminal waste of food, produced with the farmer's sweat and subsidised with the taxpayer's money. The food subsidy in 2015-16 amounted to Rs 1,03,283 crore. This had grown 53 per cent in five years — not because there were more mouths to feed but because the Centre either did not release the full subsidy amount to the FCI or delayed it. Consequently, the FCI was forced to pay Rs 35,700 crore additional interest on loans it took to complete the procurement job. This is not an isolated incident of official irresponsibility or mismanagement. All that goes on in the name of food procurement is kept hidden from the public eye as far as possible. It is only agencies like the CAG that occasionally bare a part of the rot. But for a more demanding Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan, the Rs 12,000 crore food scam in Punjab would not have come to light. How — and whether — the Centre and the previous Akali Dal-BJP government covered up everything with a Rs 31,000 crore loan remains unexplained, even under the present dispensation in Punjab."
Source of human heartbeat revealed in 3D,"London

Scientists have revealed the source of human heartbeat in unprecedented detail, an advance that may help surgeons repair hearts without damaging precious tissue.

Researchers, including those from University of Manchester in the UK, developed a way of producing three-dimensional (3D) data to show the cardiac conduction system - the special cells that enable our hearts to beat.

The 3D data makes it much easier to understand the complex relationships between the cardiac conduction system and the rest of the heart,"" said Jonathan Jarvis from Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.

Soaking post-mortem samples in a solution of iodine means soft tissue such as the heart can absorb X-rays and become visible, researchers said.

With modern X ray scanners, scientists can make detailed 3D images. In the best images, they can even see the boundaries between single heart cells, and detect in which direction they are arranged.

Within the heart, there is a special network called the cardiac conduction system that generates and distributes a wave of electrical activity stimulating the heart muscle to contract, researchers said.

This system makes sure that the various parts of the heart contract regularly and in a coordinated way, a bit like a team of rowers in a boat race.

If the system is damaged, and one part of the heart contracts out of time with the rest, then the heart does not pump so efficiently, they said.

The new data gives a much more accurate framework than previously available for computer models of the heartbeat and should improve the ability to make sense of troublesome heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation that affects 1.4 million people in the UK, researchers said.

The data reveals exactly where the cardiac conduction system is in a normal heart. For example, it shows just how close it runs to the aortic valve.

""We also use the data to make 3D printed models that are really useful in our discussions with heart doctors, other researchers and patients with heart problems,"" Jarvis said.

New strategies to repair or replace the aortic valve must therefore make sure that they do not damage or compress this precious tissue, researchers said.

""In future work we will be able to see where the cardiac conduction system runs in hearts that have not formed properly. This will help the surgeons who repair such hearts to design operations that have the least risk of damaging the cardiac conduction system,"" Jarvis said.

The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports. PTI"

Ludhiana, August 6

After incidents of braid cutting reported in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and in some parts of Punjab, Ludhiana has also witnessed four such incidents. In all these incidents, the women complained of their hair being chopped off mysteriously. One of the victims alleged her hair were chopped off by a cat while she was sitting on the rooftop of her house.

In one of the incidents, the police have registered a case under section 295 of the IPC against unknown persons. Although no proof of any specific person’s role has been found in the incidents, there is panic among residents.

In the first incident, Jaspreet Kaur of Captain Colony in the Meharban area alleged that yesterday, she was alone at her grocery store. At 9.30 pm, she started feeling that someone was pressing her shoulder and in a few seconds, she felt unconscious. In the meantime, a customer arrived there and raised the alarm. “When I woke up, I found my hair chopped. Those were lying nearby. I did not notice any person entering my shop. It seemed some supernatural power possessed me and chopped off my hair,” she alleged.

Meharban SHO Pavitar Singh said since the woman did not notice anybody entering her shop and chopping off her hair, the police had registered a case against unknown persons. Footage of CCTV cameras installed in the area would be scanned.

In the Basti Jodhewal area, Resham Kumari (57), a resident of Ram Nagar, alleged that on Friday night, she, along with her son, slept in the room. When she woke up in the morning, she found her hair chopped. “I was stunned to see a bunch of hair lying near to my bed. Neither my son nor I opened the door the whole night, still the mysterious thing happened,” the woman told the police.

In yet another incident, a 25-year-old married woman, Zainab, from Guru Gobind Nagar, said she was sitting on the third floor of her house last afternoon when she noticed that a cat arrived there, cut her hair and vanished. Basti Jodhewal SHO Vijay Kumar said the police had not received any complaint from the woman. “We visited localities as people were feeling panicky. I talked to both women. They refused to file any complaint. Still, the police are verifying the matter,” he added.

On Saturday, Paramjit Kaur (55) of Mullanpur village had alleged that an unidentified man chopped off her braid in the afternoon. She was in the kitchen when a man with his face covered climbed the boundary wall and barged into the house. He chopped off her braid with a large shear which is used to trim hedges. The woman alleged that before cutting her braid, the man asked her who did her family vote for in the last Assembly elections. A case under Section 323, 452 and 295, IPC, has been registered."
Rise to the challenge,"Building parameters catering to the needs of physically challenged and the elderly are key to inclusive habitations in the urban space

Aniel Kuumar Saha

A number of city development authorities in India launch group housing residential schemes for citizens from time to time. But it is ironical that the configuration and design of apartments on offer under these schemes are not sensitive to the needs of the physically challenged and the elderly. Even privately built residences have this lacuna. As per the census of 2011, India’s total disabled population is around 2.2 per cent (more than 2.5 crore persons). Considering the 1.25 billion population in the country, the number of disabled is significantly higher. There are also more elderly in our society. But as a result of the complete disregard for their specific needs, a large number of these people live in dwelling spaces which are not equipped enough for them. And disability being of different kinds and categories, the amount of problems for the physically challenged is very different. Actually, in most of our cities the very basic need — housing and mobility - remains a challenge for them.

While India has already passed the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill- 2016, the condition of living and standards followed for the disabled and the elderly remains abysmal in the country.

So what is the solution? The solution lies in promoting the development and construction of disabled-friendly apartments and transportation corridors and mobility across our cities. Keeping these things in mind, architects and designers have to become an important part of the design as well as the construction process. A number of design elements that can make life easy for the physically challenged and the elderly can be incorporated in the apartments.

Some such elements can be:

The common passage should have side bars on the walls to hold and walk; all staircases on the premises should be low rise and not very steep.

Easy signage and Braille signage should be a must for the benefit of the hearing and visually impaired, respectively

The steps on the staircases should be wide enough for someone who has problem in walking. For completely disabled, there should be provision of a separate lift or a separate ramp should be there.

Within apartments, too, there are certain modifications required. These can be:

Every apartment entrance and exit door has to be wide enough to make the entry of a wheel chair easy.

Rooms should have wide doors and at least one washroom/toilet has to be spacious enough to accomodate a wheel chair.

Water fittings should be installed at a lower level. The bathroom should also be accessible with grab bars around the toilet, tub and shower.

Light switches and thermostats have to be easy to reach. Kitchen counters should also be low enough to use effectively.

Within mass housing developments, particular units can be customised for the buyer with a disability or for families having a member suffering from a physical handicap.

The Model Building Bylaws 2016 (Chapter 8), IS Code 4963, CPWD guidelines for Barrier-Free environment give a very detailed design and planning guidelines to provide a barrier-free environment for disabled and elderly people. Thus for actual implementation and enforcement, there is a need for a strong business and political will. And the intent should be greater than mere profiteering.

What does the law say?

Section 45 of the notified Act requires all public buildings to be made accessible within five years of the notification of rules. However, the revised National Building Code of India should incorporate elements of a universal design to bring down barriers for the disabled.

The Act is a revised and modified version of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1996. Both aimed at creating a barrier-free environment for persons with disabilities and the elderly. Both the Acts have also mentioned about features for residential premise."
The Tribune: Jammu & Kashmir news,"SRINAGAR: The 40-day annual pilgrimage to the Amarnath shrine in south Kashmir Himalayas ended today, with 2.60 lakh pilgrims offering prayers this year despite a terror attack on a bus that left eight devotees dead.

Srinagar, August 7

The 40-day annual pilgrimage to the Amarnath shrine in south Kashmir Himalayas ended today, with 2.60 lakh pilgrims offering prayers this year despite a terror attack on a bus that left eight devotees dead.

The pilgrimage concludes on the festival of Raksha Bandhan each year.

This year's figure of pilgrims visiting the shrine is the second lowest in the past 14 years. Last year, only 2.20 lakh pilgrims had visited the cave shrine due to the summer unrest.

The holy mace of Lord Shiva -- Chhari Mubarak -- carried by a group of 'sadhus' and devotees led by its custodian Mahant Deepindra Giri, arrived at the holy cave in the early hours for day-long prayers, officials of the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) said.

The group of sadhus and devotees trekked 42 km from Pahalgam to reach the shrine with night halts at Chandanwari, Sheshnag and Panchtarani.

After traditional rituals at the sanctum sanctorum, the holy mace would start the return journey before dusk later today.

While the holy cave will be closed for darshan from today, pujan and visarjan (immersion) ceremonies for the journey of Chhari Mubarak would be performed on the banks of Lidder river in Pahalgam on 9 August.

It will be followed by a traditional open kitchen, the last ritual of the pilgrimage.

The holy mace would return to its abode at Amareshwar temple at Dashnami Akhara here the same day, the officials said.

The yatra had commenced from Pahalgam and Baltal routes amid strict security arrangements on 29 June.

While stringent security arrangement had been put in place for the yatra, Lashkar-e-Taiba militants managed to target a bus full of pilgrims on 10 July.

Eight pilgrims were killed while 21 others were injured in the attack.

Forty other pilgrims, including 16 in a road accident on Jammu-Srinagar Highway on 16 July, died during this edition of the pilgrimage with cardiac arrest being the major cause of deaths due to medical reasons.

Meanwhile, hundreds of Hindus -- mostly labourers from other states of the country -- today made a beeline for the Shankaracharya Temple atop the Zabarwan hills here to take part in prayers to mark the culmination of the yatra.

The devotees, residing in various parts of the city, started their journey to the temple by foot before day break.

Secret to true love: Dating a friend,"There’s a famous moment in When Harry Met Sally, when Billy Crystal’s character explains the age old riddle of male and female friendships. “Men and women can never be friends,” he tells Meg Ryan, “because the sex part always gets in the way.” And he’s right, sort of. Spoiler alert, Harry meets Sally, Harry befriends Sally and the two fall madly in love. It’s a narrative we’ve seen played out time and time again, spanning the Dukes of Shakespeare to the Hugh Grants of Richard Curtis. So why is it that the friends-to-lovers paradigm bears such perennial relevance? And does it work IRL? It’s been scientifically proven that the longer you’ve known somebody, the more attractive you’ll find them, researchers at the University of Texas found. They asked students to rate each other at the beginning of the semester, and again at the end. Naturally, these rates increased hugely over time, explaining how — in numerical terms — a “six” can easily become a “nine” in a matter of weeks. In other words, when it comes to long-term attraction, aesthetics has very little to do with it. A further study asked 167 couples how long they’d known one another before becoming romantically involved and whether they were friends first. They found that, on average, the couples had known each other four months before dating. Plus, 40 per cent of them were friends beforehand. You never feel more comfortable than when you’re with your friends, right? They often know you better than your fmaily. So, why is it that platonic familiarity so frequently leads to romance? “The purity of a friendship allows you to see one’s character before it’s blurred by sexual intentions and wanting to ‘get’ something physical out of it,” dating expert Matthew Hussey said.

TOKYO: A weakening Typhoon Noru made landfall in central Japan on Monday, pounding some regions with more than a month's worth of rain, but while it appeared likely to brush close to Tokyo it was losing much of its strength.

[ + read story ]

Tokyo, August 7

A weakening Typhoon Noru made landfall in central Japan on Monday, pounding some regions with more than a month's worth of rain, but while it appeared likely to brush close to Tokyo it was losing much of its strength.

At one point the world's strongest storm this year, Noru's approach to the Japanese heartland prompted evacuation advisories for tens of thousands on Shikoku, Japan's smallest main island, and more than 400 flights were cancelled, NHK public broadcaster said.

But there were no further deaths reported than two at the weekend, one of them a fisherman in his 80s who went out to check on his boat during the storm. No people were missing and only around a dozen injured, NHK added.

Noru, whose name is the Korean word for a type of deer, made landfall in the central prefecture of Wakayama on Wednesday afternoon and continued to head northeast, raising the possibility it could brush past Tokyo on Tuesday - although by then it will have weakened to a tropical depression.

Parts of Shikoku were hit with 52 mm (2.1 inches) of rain in one hour on Monday morning, with some parts of central Japan likely to see 500 mm (20 inches) of rain in the 24 hours to Tuesday morning due to the storm's unusual slowness, the meteorological agency added.

""Usually typhoons just whip right on through, but this one is so slow, the rain goes on and on,"" one man told NHK.

Three Japanese oil refiners said they had halted berth oil product shipments at their refineries in western and central Japan on Monday due to a typhoon, but that there had been no impact on refining operations or truck shipments.

Noru formed more than two weeks ago and wandered around the north Pacific in a circular course until it strengthened and began heading for Japan. At one point it was a Category 5 storm, but has been downgraded to a Category 1.

Noru is likely to weaken to tropical storm strength later on Monday, according to Tropical Storm Risk.com and be a tropical depression by the time it brushes past Tokyo on Tuesday. —Reuters"

Interest can’t be as per bank’s whim,"CONSUMER BEWARE!

Pushpa Girimaji

When I took a housing loan from my bank, I was told that I would be charged an interest of 8 per cent in the first year. The bank’s letter on the loan also made this clear and I chose this bank only because of this offer. However, the bank has charged me 9.25 per cent interest on the ground that it had made a mistake in calculating the interest rate and that the actual rate of interest was 9.25 per cent. My question is: Can a bank charge more than the rate of interest mentioned in the loan agreement? The manager says that there was a delay in getting the communication from the head office on the interest rate and that’s how the mistake happened.

In this age of electronic communication, this explanation is hard to believe. In any case, the bank cannot go back on the terms of the contract. If it has made a mistake, then it has to take responsibility for it. It cannot alter the terms of the contract signed with you. So tell the bank to refund with interest, the excess amount charged from you.

I have spoken to the manager many a times and have also complained in writing. However, the bank is not willing to make amends. What is my option now and how do I go about it?

Please write to the nodal officer of the bank. He should be able to resolve this issue immediately. If he fails to do that, I would suggest that you lodge a complaint with the banking ombudsman. You can get the contact details of the ombudsman from the bank itself. Even otherwise, the website of the Reserve Bank of India gives you the contact details of the ombudsmen in the country. The procedure is simple and you can file your complaint online. Just make sure that you send a copy or image of the loan agreement and your account details showing deduction of the loan amount.

Let me quote, for your benefit, two somewhat similar cases decided by the banking ombudsman and reported in the latest annual report of the banking ombudsman scheme. In the first case, the complainant had taken a home loan at 8.50 per cent interest per annum, to be reset every five years from the date of disbursement of the first instalment. However, after the first year, the rate of interest was changed to 9.50 per cent and then modified to 10 per cent and 12.20 per cent by the bank, without even informing the consumer. When asked about it, the bank said that the rate of interest was actually 9.25 per cent, to be reset every five years. However, in the letter given to the customer, the bank had erroneously indicated the rate of interest as 8.50 per cent and had collected the instalments at that rate for one year. It was, therefore, recovering the interest due from the customer as per the actual rate of 9.25 per cent!

The ombudsman directed the bank to calculate interest at the rate mentioned in the agreement, i.e. 8.50 per cent, for five years and refund the excess amount charged from the customer.

In another complaint, a state government entity deposited Rs 8.10 crore as fixed deposit for 90 days, on the basis of the bank’s offer of 8.8 per cent interest and 1 per cent penalty for premature withdrawal. Due to some exigency, the entity had to withdraw the money before the completion of 90 days. However, when it did so, the bank charged a penalty of 2 cent for premature closure. Here again, the bank’s justification was that it had erroneously quoted one per cent as penalty in the offer document because of a clerical error!

The banking ombudsman observed that the complainant had asked for a quotation from the bank before placing the funds in a fixed deposit. And after mentioning the penalty as one per cent in that quotation, the bank cannot revise the penalty rate. The bank was advised to calculate the penalty for premature closure of FD at one per cent and refund the excess amount deducted, along with savings bank (SB) rate of interest, calculated from the date of deduction till the date of refund."
"Partial lunar eclipse tonight, to be visible across India","Kolkata, August 7

A partial lunar eclipse will take place on Monday night and will be visible from across the country.

""Starting from 10.52 pm, the full moon will enter the Earth's shadow in space and create a spectacular celestial phenomenon, which is commonly known as partial lunar eclipse.

This will be the first properly visible lunar eclipse this year,"" Debiprosad Duari, Director Research and Academic, M P Birla Planetarium, said.

)

The partial lunar eclipse would be visible from the whole of Asia and Australia and most parts of Europe and Africa, Duari said adding: ""People in North and South America will be not be able to see it because it will be daytime there”.

The lunar eclipse will start at around 10.52 pm today and will continue till 12.48 am IST.

""The greatest eclipse that is when the Moon will be covered to the maximum extent will be around 11.50 pm. The magnitude of the eclipse, which means the fraction of the lunar diameter, will be eclipsed at the greatest eclipse moment at around 12.25am. The eclipse will last about an hour and 55 minutes,"" he said. ""The total eclipse will be visible at all places in India.”

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, the Earth and the Moon, are aligned perfectly. The Sun's rays fall on the Earth and the Moon enters the patch of where the Earth’s shadow falls.

A lunar eclipse necessarily takes place at full moon.

The shadow is composed of two cone-shaped parts, one nested inside the other. The outer shadow or penumbra is a zone where Earth shadow is partial and blocks some, but not all of, the Sun's rays.

In contrast, the inner shadow or umbra is a region where Earth blocks all direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. When a part of the Moon passes through the umbra, a partial lunar eclipse is seen.

The next lunar eclipse will occur on January 31, 2018. It will be a total eclipse visible from all parts of the Indian sub-continent, Duari said.

""Lunar eclipses are completely safe to view with the naked eye. No special filters are required to protect your eyes like those used for solar eclipses. One does not need a telescope to watch the eclipse, although a good pair of binoculars will enhance the experience,"" he said.

""The sky permitting, since it is the rainy season and the sky remains overcast most of the time, it will be a wonderful opportunity to experience this celestial event and to take photographs if possible,"" he added. — PTI"
India not responding positively to peace efforts: Pak Foreign Minister,"Islamabad, August 7

India and Afghanistan should and must respond positively to Pakistan’s peace efforts and not mistake Islamabad’s desire for peace and good relations with its neighbours as its weakness, said Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif.

(Follow

)

Addressing a press conference at the PML-N House in Sialkot, Asif said Pakistan has always wanted to have good relations with its neighbours, and especially with India and Afghanistan, and maintained that both countries are currently not responding positively to Pakistan’s initiatives for durable peace in the region.

The Dawn quoted him, as saying, “It’s high time for both India and Afghanistan to come forward as good neighbours and give positive response to Pakistan’s peace initiatives and end the blame game.” He alleged that India is violating the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) and attempting to destabilise Pakistan economically and politically. He also said that Pakistan is fully capable of defending its territory through its armed forces.

On the issue of terrorism, Asif said that the federal government has been battling it successfully for several decades, by uprooting and crushing terrorists. He said that the world was praising Pakistan’s frontline role against terrorism.

He also alleged that India and the United States were involved in an international conspiracy to sabotage the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, posing great danger to the subcontinent.

He pointed out that Pakistan had never been taken into confidence by the international community on all the clauses of the treaty.

Pakistan has now effectively taken up the burning issue of stoppage of water by India into Pakistani rivers with the World Bank which had been playing its role as a guarantor in the Indus Water Treaty. He said Pakistan wanted an amicable solution to the problem and was making all-out sincere international efforts to resolve this prolonged issue as soon as possible.

He disclosed that the issue of construction of the controversial Kishanganga dam had almost been resolved by Pakistan and India about one-and-a-half years ago, but progress on it was halted due to suspension of further talks by India thrice afterwards. — ANI"
Public art in private hands,"The sale of antiquities legally excavated is just as ethically problematic as those likely looted

Alice Stevenson

Illicit antiquities are once again in the headlines. US retailer Hobby Lobby was recently fined $3m ( Rs 19.22 cr) for illegally acquiring antiquities that were most likely looted from Iraq. Collectors and museums are therefore being reminded to undertake due diligence in checking collections’ histories before purchasing cultural property. The implication here is, of course, that when the item on the auction block has been legally excavated and diligently recorded by archaeologists, there isn’t a problem. This is an enormous mistake. Such sales may be legal, but they are still ethically problematic. At its most direct, the public auction of archaeologically procured finds puts those objects at risk of disappearing into the private domain, where their integrity is no longer assured. There are no international legal protections, no “obligations of ownership”, for cultural property in private possession. More broadly, the legal status of these sales confers an air of legitimacy to the antiquities trade. However, one looks at it as a “grey trade”. Illicit antiquities — that is things without provenance, accompanied by fake documents or with opaque ownership histories — are likely to be offered at the same sales.

Inflating prices

The origin of items offered by auction houses is supposed to be subjected to close scrutiny. This seems reassuring, but there’s a worry that the records of discovery made by archaeologists now not only certifies auction lots, but also inflates their worth. And this in a wider art market where prices have never been higher and is at risk of severe overheating. Whether they covet old masters or ancient pots, many bidders seek to acquire cultural capital, not out of some sort of honed connoisseurship or a sense of societal patronage, but as immediate monetary investments. Exceptional prices are translated into headline news, reducing heritage to economic value and undermining attempts to promote meaningful engagements with the past. Sales from museums in this context threaten public trust in them. These exorbitant prices and their media profile fuel market demand and become an incentive for looting. When heritage is sold by and for the privileged, it is those that live in proximity to archaeological sites that stand to lose the most. It denies source communities the long-term touristic potential of sites. Looting can have devastating consequences. Well-meaning efforts to protect heritage in situ have been advocated, but there needs to be more recognition that the problem often begins and ends in Europe, North America and Asia.

Public to private

Despite these problems, sales of “licit” archaeological finds are still seen as unproblematic. Just how embedded this problem is can be seen from a case from 2014, when two lots of Egyptian antiquities from the Archaeological Institute of America (AIAs) St Louis Chapter were offered for sale at Bonhams, London. Lot 160 was billed as “the treasure of Harageh” and comprised a group of 4,000-year-old stone vessels and rare examples of inlaid silver jewellery. Lot 162 was made up of a single stone headrest. The former was removed from auction following the intercession of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a private sale to it for an undisclosed sum, while the latter exceeded its estimated price at auction and disappeared into private hands. These artefacts were originally discovered during excavations conducted under the auspices of Flinders Petrie’s British School of Archaeology in Egypt (BSAE), who had regulations on where objects should go. The finds were legally removed from Egypt, they were fully documented, duly published by the BSAE and a few delivered to the St Louis Museum in 1914 under the understanding that these were for public benefit. A century later, the St Louis AIA branch contravened that agreement. The objects could have been donated to another institution capable of ensuring their long-term care and public accessibility. Instead, they went straight to the auction house.

Time to speak out

When the auction was announced, a colleague and I condemned it in a public statement [The writer is a senior lecturer in museum studies at University College London]. But many believed our reaction was melodramatic. For them, the sale was completely above board. It did not even breach AIA’s own ethical codes, which at the time only denounced the “trade in undocumented artifacts”. But given the problematic implications of selling material on the open market, we must be vocal in denouncing instances in which archaeological heritage is commercialised in this way. This is especially important given the current ideology of austerity in many countries, leading to concerns that institutions may begin to consider their public collections as assets rather than as cultural obligations. Yet museums still dispose of heritage from other countries on the open market. Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio sold ancient Egyptian artefacts from its founding collection in winter 2016 through Christie’s. We have a moral obligation to challenge these sales. Millions of artefacts have been excavated and exported by rich nations from developing countries whose own resources are now stretched as they attempt to halt the destructive looting of their heritage. We should be responsible and accountable on their behalf for material we excavated and exported. We should not condone those that seek financial profit from the past, which is the sole objective of auction houses.— The Independent"
Australia’s ‘Golden Girl’ Betty Cuthbert dead,"Cuthbert only athlete to win Olympic 100, 200 and 400 titles

Sydney, August 7

Australian sprinter Betty Cuthbert, the only athlete to have won the Olympic 100, 200 and 400 metres titles, has died aged 79 after battling multiple sclerosis for nearly half a century, Athletics Australia said on Monday.

Cuthbert won the 100m and 200m double as a teenager at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics and returned after a brief retirement to claim the 400m title in Tokyo eight years later in the final race of her career.

She also anchored Australia to the 4x100m relay gold in a world record time at the Melbourne Games and remains the joint second most decorated Australian Olympian behind swimmer Ian Thorpe.

That relay record was one of 16 she set during her career and she was among the first batch of athletes inducted into the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Hall of Fame in 2012.

Cuthbert was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1969 and had spent much of the latter part of her life confined to a wheelchair.

She returned to the public eye when the Summer Games were hosted by her home city of Sydney in 2000 and was one of the bearers of the Olympic flame at the opening ceremony.

Australia’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull led a flood of tributes to Cuthbert on Monday.

“Rest in peace Betty Cuthbert—an inspiration and a champion on and off the track,” he posted on his official Twitter feed.

The sight of the blonde Cuthbert pounding down the track to victory in her distinctive high-striding style with her mouth agape was among the most enduring images of the Melbourne Olympics.

Only 18, her haul of three gold medals in one Games was unprecedented for an Australian, although swimmers Murray Rose and Dawn Fraser later matched her feat to add more gloss to the country’s first Olympics.

“The Golden Girl tag attached itself to her for all the years afterwards, symbolic of her entrenchment in the collective affection of a nation,” Australia’s peerless Olympic historian Harry Gordon wrote of Cuthbert.

Cuthbert set four world records in 1958 but injury was to hamper her campaign at the 1960 Olympics in Rome and she retired for 18 months immediately afterwards.

A woman of deep religious convictions throughout her life, Cuthbert said an “inner voice” had persuaded her to return to the track in 1962 for a tilt at the inaugural women’s 400 metres crown in Tokyo.

Running what she later described as the only flawless race of her career, Cuthbert stormed to victory in 52.01 seconds ahead of Britain’s Ann Packer.

Her battle with multiple sclerosis began only a few years later but Gordon said it had not left her embittered.

“She is utterly content, usually bright to a point of perkiness, sustained by the company of friends and memories and the comfort of deep faith,” he wrote in 2000. Reuters"
Threads of togetherness,"The nation is celebrating Raksha Bandhan, also known as Rakhi, today. Among all festivals, dedicated to different relationships, Raksha Bandhan is one of the most popular traditional festivals of our country as brother promise to protect his sister from all evils. Colourful rakhis, sweets, new attires and a family outing, Raksha Bandhan aims to bring relationships closer. In Bollywood too, we have often seen this brother-sister bond on screen. However, there are few real life brother-sister pairs who have worked in the same project, leaving a great impact on the industry. Let’s take a look at few of these real life siblings…

Real to reel

Shraddha Kapoor is ready to let her actress powers out in a biopic based on the life of Haseena Parker, India’s most wanted criminal Dawood Ibrahim who will be played by Shraddha’s younger brother Siddhant Kapoor. Siddhant has been doing notable work in critically acclaimed films while Shraddha has girl next door characters and hits in her kitty. It’ll be interesting to see the two of the same house collaborate.

Style file

Rhea Kapoor is a fashion genius apart from being a clever producer and her work on sister Sonam is evident. The lady went onto style her brother Harshvardhan Kapoor during the promotional phase of his debut film Mirzya. Harsh’s dressing sense was appreciated by the fashion critics.

Wedding planner

Shahid Kapoor is an amazing actor but who knew his half-sister Sanah Kapoor had an acting talent hiding in her. She started her career with her brother in the film Shaandaar where Shahid played her wedding planner. It was interesting to see their fun filled chemistry on screen as friends.

Direct take

Tiger Shroff has established himself as an action and romantic actor, his sister Krishna however is an aspiring director who gathered appreciation for her documentary based on transgender. She continues to take her dream to the next level by probably becoming a feature film director because she’s been an AD on her brother’s films. Now isn’t that so cool, to have your own sister assist the director of your film.

Star power

Zoya Akhtar and Farhan Akhtar are established directors but the brother is known for being a man of many talents and acting if one of them that made him a star in three of his sister’s films, namely, Luck By Chance, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and Dil Dhadkne Do. They share a great actor-director relationship which translates on the celluloid.

Par excellence

Huma Qureshi and Saqib Saleem have their individual noteworthy performances to their credit as actors. After years of accomplishment, the duo finally came together to feature in a film Doobara: See Your Evil which released earlier this year. Their bond onscreen as siblings was appreciated by the critics."

Amritsar, August 6

The consumer forum has directed an insurance company to pay Rs 10 lakh to Brightway Constructions, an employee of which had died last year in a mishap at a construction site. The employee was insured but the firm had refused to pay. Besides, the construction company has been asked that the money, after being received, should be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased.

The Brightway Constructions was engaged by the Punjab Tourism Promotion Board for the renovation of historic Gobindgarh Fort in the city. Its employee Jethu Ram died in a mishap on April 23, 2016. The firm, in its complaint filed against the United India Insurance Company, stated that the insurance cover was valid from June 16, 2015 to June 15, 2016. When the claim was filed, the insurer repudiated it claiming that the policy did not cover risk.

The opposite party, in its reply, stated that an officer of the company inadvertently mentioned “death to employee of the contractor and other people/public” in the column of ‘personal injury or death’. It further stated that in the same cover note in special-condition column, it was mentioned that this cover note was as per the policy terms and conditions. The reply stated that terms and conditions were dispatched to the policy holder on October 16, 2015.

The forum observed that the opposite party couldn’t escape from its liability to pay the claim on the ground that the concerned officer inadvertently issued the policy to the complainant. The forum also stated that the complainant had denied having received any terms and conditions document and the opposite party had failed to rebut the claim as it had not produced on record any postal receipt regarding the dispatch of the policy as well as terms and conditions to the complainant.

While directing the company to pay the claim of Rs 10 lakh, it has also instructed it to pay Rs 3,000 as compensation for harassment and Rs 2,000 as litigation expenses."
"Those who want to quit SP, should leave without giving any excuse: Akhilesh","Lucknow, August 7

In the backdrop of three MLCs recently quitting the party and joining the BJP, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said those who wanted to go, should go without offering any excuse, so that he could ascertain who were with him in ""bad times"". Referring to the ""excuses"" put forward by the three MLCs -- Bukkal Nawab, Sarojini Agarwal and Yashwant Singh -- while leaving the party, Yadav said, ""Some people are saying they were feeling suffocated as the atmosphere of the party had gone bad. This should not be an excuse for leaving the party, they should find a better excuse."" Asserting that the party was doing well and a large number of women, farmers and youths had joined it recently, he said, ""Those who want to leave the party should not give any excuse...they can just leave. In that case, at least I will get to know who are with us during bad times."" The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister was addressing the party workers at the SP headquarters here on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan. Yadav said he had paid a visit to Nawab on Eid and had 'sewai' (a sweet dish) with him. ""At that time, he (Nawab) had not mentioned that he was planning to leave the party. It has come to our notice that there was some land issue, due to which he was being pressured,"" he added. In a dig at Nawab and the BJP, Yadav said, ""They (BJP) are doing good work. It is ironic that when a person is not in the BJP, he is labelled as a land mafia and when he joins the party, he becomes honest, upright and a gentleman. On Agarwal, who runs a medical college in Meerut in the name of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, Yadav said he was not aware of what the matter was with her. ""There could be a land issue behind it as well,"" he added. A number of women workers of the SP tied rakhi to Yadav on the occasion. —PTI"

Book your writer,"The Writers’ Museum in Dublin is the best place to meet all wordsmiths

Preeti Verma Lal

What would you say of a city that Oscar Wilde, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, George Bernard Shaw called home? A city which earned the rare Unesco City of Literature tag. A city that produced four Nobel laureates in literature. A city that had an entire novel woven around its one day: Joyce’s Ulysses (June 16, 1904). A city that has bridges named after writers. A restaurant called Chapter One. Dublin, the capital of Ireland, was surely to the alphabet born. And in this city, the best place to meet all wordsmiths is the Dublin Writers’ Museum. If you do not look up at the black wrought iron arch of No 18, Parnell Street, you’d probably miss the black wooden door that leads into the museum. It could pass off as a rich man’s 18th century Georgian townhouse. That is what it originally was — the home of George Jameson, production manager of Jameson Whiskey Distillery, who lived in this house from 1891 to 1914. With so many famous writers residing in the city, journalist Maurice Gorham (1902-1975) mooted the idea of a Writers’ Museum in Dublin. Spread over two floors, the museum opened in November 1991. The two ground floor rooms narrate the history of Irish literature from the beginning to the present time through books, personal artefacts and statues. Room 2 is entirely devoted to literary giants of the 20th century. Here, living writers are not displayed — only the dead get display space. It starts with the Irish Literary Revival — from William Butler Yeats’ mettle in founding the Abbey Theatre to Easter Rising and the publication of Joyce’s Ulysses in 1922 — a signed copy of which is on display. Joyce shares a shelf with another exile, playwright and Nobel laureate Sean O’Casey. Under glass panes in locked tables are the typewriter of James Joyce, pen and spectacles of Frank O’Connor, Oliver Gogarty’s laurels, Mary Lavin’s teddy bear; a note from Sheridan to a creditor; a signed refusal from George Bernard Shaw to provide an autograph; a concise card from Samuel Beckett and Brendan Behan’s postcard from Los Angeles (‘Great spot for a quiet piss-up’). One of the most prominent displays is the specially designed telephone of Samuel Beckett. Walk on the red carpet that drapes the wooden staircase into the Gallery of Writers, a splendidly decorated room, which was once a magnificent salon with ornamental columns and gilded frieze. James Joyce’s piano stands amid the bust and portraits of Shaw, Frank McCourt, Wilde and Beckett. Step down the staircase, open a door and you can sit in the garden with busts of writers staring from window sills. Or, you can step into the bookshop and pick a copy of your favourite book. In Dublin Writer’s Museum, you cannot play Joyce’s piano. Beckett’s black rotary phone is safely locked. The first edition of Molly Malone is sepia with age. In a museum dedicated to the written word, you cannot hear the writers speak. But their words speak to you."

Many have seen a lifetime go by hoping for a political resolution through dialogue, some clamour for ‘azadi’, and some others seek an end to violence to negotiate peace in the region that has been on an uncomfortable pause for more than 60 years

Gitanjali Sharma

The Tricolour. That’s the first sight that awaits a visitor stepping out of the Srinagar airport. Riding high on a tall mast on the airport lawns, it somewhat dwarfs the images of the green and black flags raised at pro-freedom protests. It’s a rather comforting thought, despite the promise to keep behind all preconceptions on this four-day journey to experience the Valley in its various shades.

Day 1 (Friday), Dateline: Srinagar

Minutes later, moving towards the city, the taxi driver, a local, expectedly veered the conversation around violence, the innumerable restrictions and outsiders’ apprehensions — real and imaginary. The traffic was bare minimum, courtesy the Friday factor. Zipping along the Jhelum, the driver finally applied brakes to his chatter at the hotel resting near the river, with the trailing thought: peace through dialogue remains the destination of most Kashmiris. The wait is on.

The shades of this wait were only too visible at the Dal Lake, its placidness donning a sombre shroud with few appreciators in sight. Asif Khan, one of the many shikarawallahs wistfully awaiting customers, blamed the blankness around to the recent attack on Amarnath pilgrims. When probed a little further, he vent out his anger on the government that was “doing nothing to resolve the Kashmir issue”. The wait for tourists, aman and azadi continues, he said, creating ripples in the still waters.

Postscript: Just five occupants at the hotel. A tip brought in three lovely roses from its lush garden to the room.

Day 2, Dateline: Central Kashmir

The ubiquitous wait wears a uniformed look for the soldiers tackling militants, both local and Pakistan nationals.

The run from Srinagar to Zojila passes through the heavily fortified central Kashmir towns of Ganderbal and Sonmarg. As the Amarnath yatris take this route to the Baltal camp, armed soldiers, alert to untowardness of any kind, can be seen stationed a few metres apart. Keeping endless vigil, they too appear to be players, howsoever different, in the waiting game.

“The security forces can keep the situation under control up to a certain level but beyond that the political set-up has to take over,” a top Army officer in the region summed up the lingering Kashmir crisis.

Despite the threat to even the seasonal multicultural plurality, the yatris’ enthusiasm has shown no dip. The fervour was evident too at the Pahalgam base camp in south Kashmir, which was toured the next day. The separatists may keep making loud proclamations about “Kashmiri hospitality” for “our yatri guests” but equally loud remain their frequent calls for shutdowns and “freedom”.

Postscript: Got little time to sit and stare on the Sonmarg meadows that are being overwhelmed by the surrounding construction activity.

Day 3, Dateline: South Kashmir

“I am confused. I want peace but I don’t know how it will come about. I have no faith in any of the mainstream parties. Yes, I am drawn towards the new militants surfacing on the social media. At least, they promise freedom…I live on that hope.” This outburst of a dryfruit-seller in Pampore reflects the angst of many Kashmiris and their disillusionment with political leaders. The outrage against the PDP, particularly for aligning with the rightist BJP, in its south Kashmir bastion is all too palpable.

PDP vice-president and Chief Minister’s Mehbooba Mufti’s uncle Sartaj Madni, who is one of the prime movers in the government, admitted some people were upset with their party but expressed confidence that they would come around. Hopeful of a dialogue, he placed implicit faith in the Central Government for resolving the Kashmir issue. The wait for the Modi government to take the initiative to understand and settle the Kashmir crisis hasn’t died, though some of the optimism has surely waned in the last three years.

In contrast, Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh has ruled out the possibility of a dialogue during the present situation. “The time is not conducive for talks,” he put it categorically, alluding to the unending violence.

This stance, however, doesn’t go down well with the majority in Kashmir who have been long waiting for a discourse. Prof Noor Ahmad Baba, a political expert, is of the view that Kashmir has gone restive waiting for the Central Government to at least acknowledge the problem as it exists. The signs of violence and terror in south Kashmir, the hub of militancy, are starkly visible along the Pampore-Pahalgam stretch. Just metres away from the highway at Pampore in Pulwama district stand the burnt and damaged Entrepreneurship Development Institute buildings that came under fidayeen attack twice over. A little ahead in Anantnag, comes the point where the pilgrim bus came under militant fire.

Crossing the vulnerable highway in south Kashmir, a thought creeps along: will the wait for peace remain just that. A wait. The disheartening thought, however, evaporates the minute you meet Amarnath yatra pilgrims at Pahalgam, the longer but less excruciating route to the shrine. Their enthusiasm and that of the hospitable locals around, allows faith to make way for hope again… hope for some resolution to this conflict.

The SSP at Anantnag, Altaf Khan, a counter-insurgency specialist, appeared confident about the militant count dipping significantly over the next six months. However, gullible youth turning to flashy new-age militants occupying the social media still remained a concern, he admitted while regretting the disappearance of the multi-cultural society from Kashmir. “I had 85 per cent Pandits in my class in Srinagar. The new generation hasn’t seen this plurality. Having grown up seeing only violence and mistrust, they know little of Kashmiriyat,” he asserts.

The Centre’s indecisiveness to boldly tackle the crisis, too, draws flak from some quarters. Another top cop from the region declared that the Modi government must take a decision, even if it is to bring the state fully under its control.

Postscript: The nun chai (salty tea) and flattened buns at a roadside bakery both freshened the mind and spirit.

Day 4, Dateline: North Kashmir

It was an exhilarating four-hour stretch from Srinagar to Aman Setu, the peace bridge connecting Uri with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Passing through Baramulla, the Jhelum snaked along one side and apple orchards dotted the green cover on the other.

At Aman Setu, the peace bus arrived with passengers, some returning to this side and others visiting from across the LoC. One thing they all had in common: a satiated look that comes with fulfilment of some kind. Grateful for this exchange, they gushed over the need for peace.

This wait continues, more so for the real stakeholders on the sidelines — the student who wants to attend school without fear, the soldier who hasn’t got leave to be home with his family, and the shikarawallah who wants to wind up the day with at least Rs 500 in his pocket.

Minutes after the arrival of the peace bus came the flash about shelling near Aman Setu. News from the Rajouri area had already come earlier in the day of a soldier and a six-year-old girl succumbing to heavy Pakistan shelling.

Heading back through a vulnerable area, the mind was blank, there was no room for fear or anxiety. All that it carried with it was the burden of the lives gone and the lives still struggling as the conflict and the wait lives on.

Postscript: On the return flight, a Kashmiri Pandit was sceptical about resolving the Kashmir crisis through dialogue. Minutes later, however, she said resignedly: “Probably, that’s the only way out.”"
Amitabh Bachchan does not want 75th birthday celebrations,"Mumbai, August 7

Megastar Amitabh Bachchan says he does not want people to organise any special event for his 75th birthday.

Man dies after Fatehabad BJP municipal chief stops ambulance for long,"Sushil Manav

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 7

A patient allegedly died after Fatehabad BJP municipal president stopped an ambulance for over half-an-hour after his car had a minor accident with it.

Meanwhile, people have demanded registration of a criminal case against the municipal president Darshan Nagpal. Atma Ram, SHO of Fatehabad city police station, said they have received a complaint against Nagpal, but, he said the police was inquiring the matter as the two sides were in touch to find a solution to the issue. In his complaint to the police, Arun Kumar, a resident of Fatehabad town, alleged that his uncle, Naveen Kumar, felt uneasiness on Sunday morning and was taken to a private hospital on Bhattu road for treatment.

""However, the doctors advised us to take him to a cardiologist in Tau Devi Lal Market situated at a distance of 3 kilometer from there,"" he said.

Arun alleged: ""At Lal Batti Chowk, the ambulance carrying my uncle touched Nagpal’s car. Since, the ambulance driver was in a hurry, he tried to move ahead towards the hospital, but he was stopped by Nagpal and roughed up. We kept pleading with Nagpal to allow my uncle to be shifted to the hospital since his condition was serious, but he did not relent and in the process wasted a precious over half-an-hour when my uncle could have got emergency care. He died before he could be attended to by the doctors.” Arun alleged that despite formal complaint the police was dilly-dallying in registering his FIR and was rather pressuring them to enter into a compromise with Nagpal.

Nagpal, however, denied allegations and said the ambulance driver had sped away after hitting his car from behind at the Lal Batti Chowk.

“I just went up to the ambulance only after it had reached the hospital in Tau Devi Lal Market,” Nagpal said."
IIT scientists develop silk mats that could treat arthritis,"New Delhi

Scientists from IIT Guwahati have synthesised mats made of silk-proteins and bioactive glass fibres that they believe can assist the growth of bone cells and repair worn-out joints in arthritis patients.

The disease most commonly affects joints in the knees, hips, hands, feet, and spine and is marked by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bones.

Left untreated, it can cause severe pain, swelling, and eventually limited range of movement.

""Current clinical treatment methods are limited by lack of viable tissue substitutes to aid the repair process,"" Biman B Mandal from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG) told PTI.

To develop a suitable tissue substitute, scientists, including those from the University College London in the UK, looked into the natural bone-cartilage interface and tried to mimic it synthetically in lab conditions.

Knee osteoarthritis is the most common bone and joint disease in India. However, Mandal pointed out that the available clinical grafts were expensive.

""We used silk, a natural protein to fabricate electrospun mats to mimic the cartilage portion and bioactive glass to develop a composite material, similar to the natural tissue,"" said Mandal.

For the mat, scientists used a kind of silk easily available in North-east India.

""Muga (Assam) silk is endowed with properties that enhance the healing process,"" he said.

The researchers adopted a green fabrication approach for the developing the silk composite mats - electrospinning.

""It is similar to knitting, except that it utilises electric high voltage force to draw ultrafine fibres,"" Mandal said.

A layer-by-layer approach was followed, where the bone layer was first formed, on top of which the cartilage layer was developed. The resulting composite mat resembled the architecture of the bone-cartilage interface.

To assist the regenerative process, the mats would be grafted in the defected joint with cells harvested from the patient.

""The mats bond with the native tissue and acts as an artificial tissue construct. Eventually the mats degrade with time and new tissue is formed in its place,"" Mandal said.

The mats were tested under laboratory conditions, where artificial tissue formed efficiently during the two weeks of the study, researchers said.

However, the mats need to be tested in suitable animal models like rabbits and pigs, and finally in human trials, before they become available to patients. — PTI"
Bowie wins women’s 100m title; Rio gold medallist Thompson flops,"WORLD ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS

London, August 7

American Tori Bowie won the women’s 100 metres world title making up for her silver in last year’s Olympics, while Rio gold medallist Elaine Thompson struggled home in fifth place.

The 26-year-old on Sunday made up metres on long time leader Marie-Josee Ta Lou of the Ivory Coast to edge her with the final dip on the line at the World Athletics Championships.

Bowie fell to the ground after crossing the line and initially it was Ta Lou who celebrated only for the board to say otherwise.

“I had no idea that I had won,” said Bowie, who has a habit of hurling herself at the line in major championships finals having done a similar thing in the Olympic 200m final last year which saw her take the bronze.

“The only thing I knew was that tonight I was going to lay it all on the line.”

The Netherlands’ Dafne Schippers finished third while hot favourite and 100m Olympic champion Thompson faded to fifth.

The 25-year-old Jamaican had started well but by halfway she had been swallowed up and was unable to find an extra gear as she had done most of the season.

Ta Lou then emerged as the clear leader but Bowie ate into her advantage and then produced the dip of her life to take the title from under the diminutive Ivorian’s nose.

Ta Lou’s compatriot and 2013 world double sprint medalist Murielle Ahoure also suffered frustration in being edged out of bronze by Schippers, who will look to retain her world 200m title later in the week. AFP"
"BCCI’s legal team to study order, Kerala CA backs Sreesanth","New Delhi, August 7

The BCCI on Monday said it would adopt a wait-and-watch policy on pacer S Sreesanth, whose life ban was lifted by the Kerala High Court, even as the cricketer’s state association welcomed the reprieve. Asked about the BCCI’s stand, acting president CK Khanna said: “The judgment has come today. The BCCI’s legal team will study the judgment and give its observations. Obviously, their feedback will be taken and placed at an appropriate forum (general body).” The Kerala Cricket Association said it’s happy with the development. “We were right behind Sreesanth from day one. We were in Delhi during those days (arrest and subsequent court hearings) when he endured a lot. Now that the High Court has given a verdict, hopefully, normalcy will return in his life. We would love to see him back in Kerala shirt,” KCA secretary Jayesh George told PTI. The KCA, though, remained apprehensive about the BCCI’s stand. “Look, two years back, we had appealed to the BCCI requesting to lift Sreesanth’s ban after the lower court in Delhi exonerated him of all spot-fixing charges. The BCCI then decided to stick to life ban. Now that the Kerala High Court has given the verdict, the BCCI may think of appealing to the Supreme Court. We don’t know what will be their stand,” George said. When asked whether Sreesanth would be considered for the Ranji Trophy selection this season if all went well, George said: “That I can’t tell you right now as it will be a collective decision by the association. Also, we have our selectors who need to take a call on his fitness. “He is 34 and hasn’t played for four years. Obviously, with his talent and experience, he is an asset for the Kerala Ranji team. “We now have pacers like Basil Thampi (current India A player), Sandip Warrier. If Sree is around, obviously they can gain from his experience.” In his order, Justice A Muhamed Mustaque also set aside all proceedings against Sreesanth initiated by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The court had earlier sought the BCCI’s stand on the plea by the cricketer, challenging the life ban imposed on him by the game’s governing body following the 2013 Indian Premier League-6 spot-fixing scandal. The BCCI had filed a counter-affidavit in the court in response to the plea by Sreesanth, who had challenged the life ban despite a court dropping all charges against the 34-year-old pacer. The cricket board had said, “The decision of the sessions court to acquit the petitioner from the criminal charges has no impact whatsoever on the decision of the internal disciplinary committee of the BCCI to ban the petitioner from playing cricket tournaments organised by the BCCI and/or its affiliates.” It had said the question before the court was whether the petitioner (and other accused) was liable to incur penal consequences under relevant criminal statutes. On the other hand, the question before the BCCI Disciplinary Committee was whether the petitioner was guilty of match-fixing, corruption and gambling and violation of the internal disciplinary rules of the BCCI, the board had said. The standard of proof required under a penal statute was much higher than the proof required for a disciplinary inquiry, it had said. PTI"
Solo & safe?,"The recent incident of a girl being stalked at night takes the sheen away from City Beautiful, and its claim of being ‘woman friendly’

Jasmine Singh

The recent incident involving Haryana’s BJP chief’s son stalking an IAS officer’s daughter in Chandigarh has again raised the question of women safety in the city. Chandigarh enjoys the tag of a smart city, but an incident like this makes one wonder how smart is this place, rather how secure? Anuradha Singh, an assistant librarian, has no complaints when it comes to women enjoying public space and life in Chandigarh with a sense of security. “I have to rethink about it now. With all the security that we have, regular naakas in the city something like this could happen,” she wonders. Chandigarh is a city where students come to study, where people move from smaller towns in search of better job opportunities, and, safety is always the first concern. In fact, we’ve always pointed towards other cities, especially Delhi on how unsafe it is for girl and women in comparison to Chandigarh. Manpreet Aujla and her friend Riti Joshi are students of interior designing from sector-34, these two girls stay at a PG accommodation and often step out in the night around 10 or 11 in the night to have ice cream from Aroma-22. “Who said Chandigarh is safe, just because one doesn’t get to hear many incidents of stalking or molestation, we feel it is safe, but for once, try stepping out alone with a female friend,” Manpreet looks at Riti who seconds her friends opinion. The two ride a two-wheeler and there have been so many instances when they have been stalked. “Once, I decided to file a formal complaint with the police, but then we thought its best to not go out alone,” the two don’t sound happy with the decision they’ve taken but, they’ve no choice. Even though Chandigarh has appreciable police surveillance, even though the city has a night life which is doesn’t evoke the word rowdiness, an incident like this enough to make everyone alert. Does that point towards the fact that there is something majorly wrong with society? “Something has to be really wrong with how we see girls and women in society,” shares Dr Anju Kathurai, a sociologist, trying to find reasoning for it. “A girl or a woman, travelling, standing, eating out or even watching a film alone is somewhat not acceptable to society, and, here, I mean men. They immediately relate this to the morality of a female, generalising that all women or girls who can eat out alone, drive do not have a strong moral character, which is disgusting.” Well, we can only call our city smart if a girl can return home in the night without being stalked, if she can walk in the street in a mini skirt without being cat-called, if she doesn’t have to request her male friends to accompany her for a late night eating out or movie!"
Six villages without potable water for 3 days,"Mahesh Chander Sharma

Sundernagar, August 6

Thousands of residents, living on the outskirts of the town, have been doing without potable water for the past three days, due to faulty management of the IPH Department. The residents of Mahadev, Chowk, Dhanotu and other three adjoining villages, have been complaining for the past many months that the supply of drinking water was erratic in the area but the officials of the Irrigation and Public Health Department were unable to resolve the problem. In order to supply water in these villages, the water is taken from the Ghangal Khud with the help of a pumping machinery and is stored in the overhead tank situated in Mahadev village. And it is from this village the water is supplied to other villages. The residents further claimed that whenever they questioned the field officials of IPH Department about the reason behind the defective water supply, they said it was due to a fault in the pumping machinery. These areas remained without water for four to five times in a month and further the no timing of water supply was observed. There has been no supply of water in these areas for the past three days. The villagers have been inconvenienced and are annoyed with the staff of the IPH Department.They blamed the officials and said poor maintenance, labour management and low quality of pumping machinery had led to such a situation. The officials of the IPH Department remained tight lipped as to why the pumping machinery frequently went out of order. However, they admitted that there was a fault in the machinery and the water supply would be restored by this evening."

Mumbai bus strike called off on Uddhav Thackeray’s intervention,"Shiv Kumar

Tribune News Service

Mumbai, August 7

Employees of the civic-owned Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking on Monday called off their indefinite strike after Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray promised to ensure that their salaries will be paid on time.

Leaders of several unions met with Thackeray at his residence Matoshree to discuss their grievances.

Thackeray assured the striking employees that their salaries would be disbursed before the 10th of every month.

For the past several months, the financially troubled undertaking was paying salaries nearly a month late.

BEST employees were also demanding that the budgets of the BEST and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation be merged so that funds for the undertaking could directly be provided from the civic body’s coffers.

Thackeray assured the unions that a decision on this would be taken in a couple of months.

Following the decision to call off the strike, BEST buses began to pull out of depots and hit the roads.

Union leaders said it would be some hours before services would return to normal.

Earlier today, the indefinite strike left lakhs of Mumbaiites struggling to reach work on time.

Across the city, commuters spoke of auto-rickshaw and taxi drivers charging way above the metered fare during the morning peak hours.

App-based taxi providers Uber and Ola were also reported to be charging surge pricing.

“Though it is a Raksha Bandhan holiday in many offices, trains are full today,” Arjun Sawant, commuting from Borivli in the suburbs to downtown Churchgate, said.

BEST’s 3700 buses ferry more than 30 lakh passengers in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai.

Most of the passengers take the iconic red buses to the railway station though students and senior citizens often make use of the long-distance services of the buses.

A ballot held by the co-ordination committee of several BEST employees’ union had 97 per cent of the staffers supporting the strike.





The state government had also asked owners of private buses and school buses to ferry commuters as an emergency measure."

Three sanitation workers died after inhaling toxic gases while cleaning a gutter in Lajpat Nagar, said a police officer.

A PCR call was registered at 1 pm today that three persons are dead in a sewage drain in the Lajpat Nagar area. On reaching the spot, it was noticed by the police that some workers were checking a sewer line opposite MCD office near Kabir Ram temple and when they entered the sewer line, they were exposed to obnoxious gases and felt suffocated, said DCP Romila Baniya, South East District.

Soon they were taken to AIIMS Trauma centre where they were declared brought dead.

The deceased have been identified as Joginder (32), Annu (28), both residents of Khichidipur, the third person is still unidentified. His age is said to be 25 years. Legal action under 304 IPC is being taken, said the DCP.

Meanwhile, BJP president Manoj Tiwari has urged the Lt Governor Anil Baijal to order a high-level probe into the death of Safai Karamcharis reported to have been privately hired by a Junior Engineer of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB).

It is being said that the DJB officials did not ensure compliance of safety measures before starting the cleaning work, said Tiwari.

The DJB should immediately clarify whether the said Safai Karamcharis were its regular employees or casually hired. And it is not the first incident of death of such workers during the cleaning of sewers. The attitude of the Jal Board officials continues to be callous, added the BJP president.

Further, the BJP president has urged the LT Governor that the families of all three young Safai Karamcharis be paid compensation even if they were casually hired.

On its part, the government has ordered an inquiry into the incident while Water Minister Rajendra Gautam said the three deceased were neither DJB staff nor authorised to carry out the sewer cleaning job.

""I am very sad to know that 3 workers have died during cleaning of sewer at Lajpat Nagar I have set up an inquiry,"" tweeted the Water Minister."
Middleman used links with senior officials,"BRIBE CASE

Gets one-day remand along with SDM

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 6

Investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the arrest of an HCS officer, posted as SDM (East), her husband and a middleman while allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 75,000, has revealed that the middleman had come in contact with the officer using links of higher officials. The role of one more officer in the SDM’s office, whose name has cropped up, will also be investigated by CBI sleuths. All three accused were produced before the Duty Magistrate, who remanded the HCS officer and the middleman in one-day custody while the officer’s husband was sent to judicial custody. The complainant in the case, Tarsem Kumar, had alleged that there was a property dispute between him and his brother and the matter was listed for hearing in the court of SDM (East) Shilpi Pattar. The property dispute was reportedly decided by the SDM on August 3, directing that the disputed property at the grain market in Sector 26 be sealed, without hearing the complainant. The property was sealed by the police the same day. According to the CBI, the complainant discussed the case with GS Brar, who took him to the SDM’s office. It was also alleged that Brar told the complainant that the SDM would revoke her decision provided the complainant paid a bribe of Rs 5 lakh to her. The bribe amount was reduced to Rs 2 lakh. The CBI laid a trap and caught Brar and the SDM while taking Rs 75,000 as the first instalment. SDM’s husband Dheeraj Dutt was also arrested as Rs 50,000 of the bribe money was recovered from him while Rs 25,000 was recovered from Brar. CBI sources said the SDM’s husband tried to hide the money in his undergarments.A search conducted at the SDM’s house in Sector 27 led to the recovery of Rs 2 lakh, bank locker keys and documents pertaining to bank accounts.Sources said during the probe, it came to light that Brar came in contact with the SDM by using links of higher officials, which had to be investigated. CBI sleuths will also question the officer whom the complainant was asked to meet by the SDM to get the work done.

SDM’s husband seen smiling

While SDM Shilpi Pattar had moist eyes, there was no sign of remorse on her husband’s face, who was seen smiling outside the Duty Magistrate’s house in Sector 19.More than 30 cases of violation and misuse of property are pending in the court of SDM (East) Shilpi Patter Dutt. SDMs have been delegated the powers of the Estate Officer by the UT to hear cases of violation of building bylaws. All buildings are covered under the Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulation) Act, 1952, implemented in the city. The Estate Officer first issues a notice to the owner if violation of building bylaws is found during checking. If the owner fails to remove the violations after the notice, the SDM can seal the building. The Estate Officer also has the power to de-seal the building ."

A slice of Denmark in US,"The windmills, wooden storks and elf houses atop Danish-style buildings of Solvang in California take you to a fairytale world

Rashmi Gopal Rao

Translating into “sunny field” in Danish, Solvang was founded by three Danish immigrants Reverend Benedict Nordentoft, Reverend Jens M. Gregersen and Professor Peder P Hornsyld — all of who shared a common dream of establishing a Danish town in America. To provide a bit of context; between 1861 and 1910, there was an exodus of people from Denmark who migrated to the United States in anticipation and hope of better economic opportunities, social status and freedom. The number crossed a whopping 90,000 in the 1880s and while the Danes settled in their new country, they still bonded together on Danish culture, customs and traditions. Hence, there were several Danish colonies that mushroomed during this time in the midwest. Solvang is an example of one of the most successful Danish colonies founded in 1911. With a population of about 5,500, Solvang is a picturesque town, 24 km north of the Pacific coast and about 75 km from Santa Barbara in California. Replete with the old-world charm, a visit to Solvang is sure to get your senses refreshed. It is the sort of town where almost everyone knows everyone else. ‘Downtown’ consists of a few blocks and a couple of crossroads. Stores are small and cozy. Traffic is sparse and life is pleasantly slow paced. An ideal weekend getaway from Los Angeles, Solvang is best explored on foot. However, if you want to experience the rustic essence of this little town, hop on to the Solvang trolley that provides a narrated tour of the town in a carriage that is drawn by two draft horses! A romantic experience, which has been in existence since 1973. The best way to start your tour would be to make a stop at the Elverhoj Museum of History and Art that is just about two blocks away from the town centre. Housed in a traditional structure that is reminiscent of an 18th century Danish farmhouse, the first thing that catches your attention as you approach the museum is the hand-crafted wooden door with an innovative latch, reminiscent of the days of the yore. The museum was once the residence of Solvang’s most-gifted couple Viggo Brandt-Erichsen and his wife, Martha Mott, who were acclaimed artists and built this house in the 1950s. One of the few museums dedicated to Danish culture outside of Denmark, Elverhoj has extensive exhibits relating to Solvang’s history and development. The museum celebrates the industrious Danish-American spirit, including the native culture and heritage through several photographs, models, artefacts, sculptures and paintings. As you take a stroll through the serene, balmy roads lined with picture-perfect houses set amid the prettiest of gardens, you notice many of these have large birds ‘resting’ on the rooftops. A closer look will reveal that these are wooden models of the European white stork that is now officially extinct in the wild in Denmark. Nevertheless, it is a tradition to have these birds on rooftops as these are believed to bring good luck and prosperity. Windmills, little elf houses that are believed to protect houses and Scandinavian-styled buildings with timbered roofs are other typical Danish symbols commonly found in Solvang. It is only apt that Solvang, which seems to be straight out of a fairytale, houses the museum of Hans Christian Andersen, apart from a Hans Christian Andersen square. Located in the Book Loft building, this charming museum is a trip down memory lane where you can browse books, artefacts and memorabilia related to the fairytales. Operated by the Ugly Duckling foundation, the museum has exhibits relating to Andersen’s life, including a model of his childhood home and antique tools for making wooden shoes. While in the town, do take time out to check out the fare in the bakeries and restaurants that serve speciality Danish pastries, pancakes and sausages."

Mumbai, August 7

Megastar Amitabh Bachchan says he does not want people to organise any special event for his 75th birthday.

The 74-year-old actor turns a year older on October 11.

“Many threaten and plan a 75th celebration for my birth... May it be known that there shall be no such event, allowed or even acknowledged,” Bachchan posted on his blog.

“May it be known that if there is such move by others they must withdraw from it for I shall never acknowledge or endorse such... Be it family or Ef or any other... It is not going to be with any consent...” he wrote.

The “Pink” star said if his wishes were not respected, he would end up going to “some isolated unknown location which shall never be known by any”. — PTI"

Bathinda, August 6

After getting a rap on its knuckles from the Local Bodies Department, the Municipal Corporation Bathinda (MCB) has drastically reduced the price at which it would buy tree guards as part of its plantation drive.

While earlier, it had proposed to buy tree guards at Rs 2,250 each, now the rate has been brought down to Rs 1,280.

In May, the cash-strapped Municipal Corporation Bathinda had planned to spend Rs 1.09 crore to buy 5,000 tree guards for the city.

Apart from this, the MCB had also planned to spend Rs 35.5 lakh on fixing and installing these tree guards.

Interestingly, the MCB had installed around 4,000 tree guards last year as well but no one knew where these were installed.

In July, the Local Bodies Department rejected the proposal of the MCB to buy 5,000 tree guards.

The state government also asked the MCB to explain about the status of the tree guards bought last year.

The department directed the MCB to present the tree guard proposal again in the general house meeting.

The Horticulture Branch of the MCB tabled a renewed proposal during the Finance and Contract Committee (F&CC) meeting held on August 2.

In the proposal not only the number of tree guards to be purchased was brought down, the rate at which these were to be bought was also cut.

The branch submitted a report, which stated that it had called for tenders to purchase 1,500 tree guards.

Of the five tenders, which the horticulture branch received, the tender was allotted to Garg Industries, which quoted the lowest price of Rs 18.68 lakh.

The horticulture branch mentioned that the rate at which the tender was granted was considerably low than the last time.

The proposal clarified that due to amendments in the rate of steel, this time the tender had been granted at Rs 18.68 lakh as against Rs 33.75 lakh quoted last time."

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","Into its seventh season, TV series Game of Thrones remains as big and arresting as ever. Decoding its stupendous success, however, remains both a mystery and an enigma

05 Aug 2017 | 11:28 AM

When you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die. But the epic show remains a ceaseless winner. Into its seventh season, its grip is as firm, the frenzy as frenzied and viewership far from diminished.

When you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or die. But the epic show remains a ceaseless winner. Into its seventh season, its grip is as firm, the frenzy as frenzied and viewership far from diminished. Why, the premier show even crashed the HBO website. Reams have been written on what makes it the most popular show around the world. Yet no one can truly decode the volatile combination that is as high on surprise as emotional connect. More recently, a study has been undertaken to deconstruct its stupendous success.

Chance viewing of the Game of Thrones episode is unlikely to hook you. Battery of actors, numerous spheres of action and multiple hydra-headed plots are instead likely to leave you befuddled. But if you are one of the millions glued to the show, the likes of which television has never seen before, you will be in a permanent jaw-dropping state.

To borrow an analogy from the Indian tradition, one can easily say it has all the navarasas. Though some would say more of the vibhats ras, indeed much of its content has disgust-evoking highs or lows, if you prefer. Incest, rape, violence, bestiality, nudity... in the fantasy world of Westeros, there is much that is off putting. Some of its episodes: Stannis Baratheon agreeing to burn his only child on stake, Sansa Stark’s gruesome rape at the hands of her despotic husband Ramsay Bolton, are all brutal reminders that nothing is fair in the war for seven kingdoms. Many of these blood-curdling moments have not only led to much heartburn and earned it flak but even veered some viewers away. But what keeps them coming back despite gore is the manner in which it unfolds surprises. You never ever know what the next episode of the show will come riding on.

Spoilers invariably abound and soon after Season Five peaked with one of its most favourite protagonists Jon Snow’s death, news of his possible resurrection leaked as Kit Harington playing Snow was spotted shooting in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Indeed the magic in the series is for real. Yet even more magical are its enigmatic characters you dare fall in love at your own peril. For you don’t know when the writer has planned their demise. Based on George R.R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones, the first novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, what was conceived as a trilogy has now stretched into seven volumes and eight seasons.

Considered un-filmable once, now the reins rest with David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss. The buzz goes around that when both call an actor of the series, it signals their imminent end. So strong is the bond with the characters that even actors mourn the demise of their reel character. More recently, Jessica Henwick, who plays Nymeria Sand, felt a great sense of loss and grief. One of its most enduring and endearing characters, Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, says he has to know whether his character has survived the season for him to truly map it. An imp, he has the serial’s most intelligent lines such as, “Never forget who you are for the world won’t, wear it like an armour and no one will hurt you.”

Most fantasy series are targeted at children, and perhaps the child in us. But Game of Thrones comes laced with not only adult-rated scenes, much of which is, of course, has been censored for the Indian audience, but also highbrow stuff. Sardonic humour, witty one-liners, wisecracks are as much its USP as the grand scale and magnitude achieved at a whopping cost of $10 million. Even Hollywood borrows its catchphrases. Baywatch turned around the tagline “Winter is coming” into “The summer is coming”.

But who can recreate the world far-removed from ours; what with ghost-walkers, fire-spewing dragons, wildlings, brave and ambitious lords, scheming men and sinister women. Yet, somehow, amid all that is alien, even abhorrent to our sensibilities, it manages to bat for women. Two of its most powerful protagonists are women. But if you think Game of Thrones is politically or socially correct, think again. It follows no rules. Grey is a colour Indians understand too well, and here men and women painted in broad brush strokes of black like Jamie Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) could suddenly warm their way to your heart.

The epic series, however, isn’t your heart-tugging drama. Each viewer might have its own favourites. Author Martin’s obviously is Tyrion, the imp, which explains why the dwarf stands tallest among them all. Spunky Arya Stark (Maise Williams) is supposedly his wife’s, a reason many believe she won’t be bumped off. But who will really survive, in the final countdown? Well, that question is what makes this game of the survival of the fittest, fiercest and cruellest, an addiction viewers just can’t get rid of."
The Tribune,"DUBAI: An Indian businessman in the UAE, who has spent over USD 4 million to help free prisoners languishing in jails due to non-payment of debts, has been honoured with the country’s prestigious Community Service Medal.

Dubai, August 6

An Indian businessman in the UAE, who has spent over USD 4 million to help free prisoners languishing in jails due to non-payment of debts, has been honoured with the country’s prestigious Community Service Medal.

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior of the UAE, Lt General HH Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan, honoured Indian businessman and philanthropist Firoz Merchant with the Community Service Medal on Monday.

The award, which is given in the form of a medal, was given to Merchant in recognition of his efforts to serve the community in the country and beyond.

This is the first time any expatriate community member has been given this prestigious award.

Since 2008, Merchant, founder and chairman of Pure Gold Jewellers, has spent Dh 15 million (USD 4.08 million) in paying off the debts of 10,940 prisoners languishing in the country’s jails due to non-payment of debts.

The prisoners belong to all faiths and nationalities and were in jail because of their inability to clear debts even though they have completed their jail terms.

Merchant dedicated this award and medal to his countrymen living in and outside the country.

“I am sincerely thankful to the UAE government for acknowledging my efforts. Whatever I have done, and will continue to do, is for the love of the UAE and India. I represent my country India and the UAE is my second home. I will do whatever I can for this beautiful country and its people,” he said.

Merchant said he is helping those who are the victims of circumstances.

“These people (prisoners) are not criminals. They are in jail because they unfortunately accumulated debt and have not been able to clear them,” said 59-year-old Merchant who began his gold business in 1989.

Speaking on the occasion, Nahyan, said he was very happy with the philanthropic work being done by Merchant and would want him to continue his noble work in future too.

He also applauded Merchant for his good deeds and said that it makes him feel proud to have expatriates such as Merchant who selflessly and tirelessly work for the betterment of the society.

He assured Merchant all necessary cooperation from the government as and when required.

Undersecretary of the Ministry of Interior, Lt General Saif Abdullah Al Shafar, who was also present during the award ceremony acknowledged Merchant’s philanthropic activities and considered him to be a great human who had always stood by the less fortunate.

Besides the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Interior, Lt General Saif Abdullah al-Shafar, Major General Salam Al Shamshi and many senior police officials were also present on the occasion. — PTI"
How to defeat the idea of traffic management,"GOOD MOTORING

H. Kishie Singh

It has been repeated, ad nauseam, in this column that what we need is an expert on traffic. Judging by the so-called improvement of Chandigarh roads, it is abundantly clear that no one in the Chandigarh Administration and the Chandigarh Police have the foggiest notion of this term. I suspect we have a babu who may not even have a driving licence, but is making decisions on traffic management in the city. For the benefit for the city drivers and the powers that be, let us define the term ‘traffic management’. Well, traffic management means free and easy flow of traffic in controlled and safe conditions. Having explained that, I am obliged to ask, why are there two speed breakers at the entrance to Raj Bhawan? Traffic on this road, Vigyan Path, flows uninterrupted. Not being happy with such a scenario, two speed breakers have been built on this road. Surely, the Governor’s driver and escort vehicle have the brains to stop as they exit, look left and right, and then enter the main road. This happens occasionally. In any case, there are always half-a-dozen policemen on duty to control traffic and give His Excellency the right of way. Now, these speed breakers are an impediment, 24x7, in the free flow of traffic. They serve no practical purpose. It is also an accepted fact that speed breakers can cause accidents. Then there is the brilliant move of diverting weekend traffic through Sector 5. The diversion was necessary because Sarovar Path is closed at the Vigyan Path roundabout. The traffic is obliged to turn left to get to Sukhna Lake. The Police also did a left turn and, like water takes the path of least resistance, the Police did the same. They came to the Sector 5 entrance and diverted traffic to turn right. They did not solve a problem, they created one. A crossroad complete with barriers, creating a dangerous situation and making life hell for the residents of Sector 5. All the holiday makers now drive through the heart of Sector 5 to the Lake. It would have been much easier to take the traffic another 100 meters to Himalaya Marg, a wide sector dividing road. However, a hundred metres was a road too far! The latest disaster in traffic management thrust on Chandigarhian’s is at the junction of Chandi Path and Madhya Marg. Driving along Madhya Marg, you will come to a roundabout. Under the traffic lights there is a sign ‘No Left Turn’! Somebody please tell me what to do? Another point: If you are driving north on Chandi Path, just as you approach Madhya Marg, there is a slip road. The purpose of a slip road is to allow traffic to slip from the main road to prevent congestion. And guess what? There could be a red light at the end of the slip road to prevent you from entering Madhya Marg! This defeats the whole purpose of the slip road. Traffic now backs up on two roads. Nothing could be more counter- productive than blocking a slip road exit. The slip road is not very long. The length can accommodate two, may be three cars. The rear end of the fourth car could jut out on to Chandi Path, creating another problem.

No takers for CM’s appeal to give up power subsidy,"Govt to frame policy, to be announced this month

Ruchika M Khanna

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 6

Figure it out

When Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh announced during the Budget session in June that he had given up power subsidy on his agricultural land, it was expected that other MLAs and ministers, besides affluent farmers across the state, might follow suit. However, no one has come forward so far to surrender the subsidy, even though the matter had kick-started a debate during the Assembly session. Enquiries made by The Tribune across Malwa, where most of the power subsidy beneficiaries are based — suggest that no one has approached the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for giving up their subsidy. Inderjeet Singh, Deputy Chief Engineer, Muktsar power circle, said he had not received any application from farmers wanting to give up subsidy. There are 1,01,843 tubewell connections in the Muktsar circle. The state government gives the PSPCL compensation at the rate of Rs 4.58 for every subsidised unit of power given to farmers. A Venu Prasad, Chairman, PSPCL, told The Tribune that the power corporation would come up with a policy for those who wanted to give up power subsidy. “The policy will fix a rate at which the PSPCL will charge those who start paying power tariff. The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) will determine the rate and it can be lower than Rs 4.58 per unit. We are also planning to install smart meters for such agricultural consumers and the PSPCL itself will note the meter reading. The policy will be announced this month,” he said. During the last financial year (2016-17), the state government’s power subsidy bill was Rs 5,600 crore. It has increased to Rs 10,000 crore this financial year, with the farm sector accounting for a major share (Rs 7,660 crore). Subsidy to farmers — where power to their tubewell connections is not charged — was the brainchild of the then Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. This ended up benefitting the big landowners, as small and marginal farmers do not have tubewell connections, especially in south Malwa.Rs 5,600 crore Last fiscal’s power subsidy bill Rs 10,000 crore This fiscal’s bill Rs 7,660 crore Share of farm sector (Inputs from Archit Watts, Muktsar)"
"Unsafe, Baddi-Barotiwala bridge closed","Ambika Sharma

Mining to blame

Traffic to Barotiwala has been diverted through Marrawala on National Highway-21A

Indiscriminate mining in the river has led the river to change its course

A gap of 5-6 metres between the upstream and downstream had been created

A huge volume of water following heavy rain damaged the structure

With four spans of the Balad bridge connecting the Barotiwala industrial area to Baddi facing severe damage after incessant rain in the last 48 hours, it has been declared un-safe and closed to vehicular traffic. Traffic towards the Barotiwala industrial area has been diverted through Marrawala on National Highway-21A. The bridge has bent inwards in the middle following erosion of a sizeable portion of the structure. Executive Engineer, Public Works Department, Sanjiv Agnihotri, said indiscriminate mining in the river had led the river to change its course. A gap of 5-6 metres between the upstream and downstream had been created. A huge volume of water damaged the structure. He said a portion of the bridge was repaired last year too. He said repair work could only begin once the rain stopped and about Rs 30 lakh would be spent though the actual estimate would be drawn after its inspection. Constructed in 1970s, this 180-m bridge has been facing an immense wear and tear in view of the movement of heavy trucks. Agnihotri said they had sought Central funds of about Rs 8 crore for constructing a 200 m new bridge as this old bridge was unable to withstand the increasing influx of vehicles. SDM, Nalagarh, Ashutosh Garg, who ordered the closure of the bridge for traffic, said since the bridge could collapse, it has been closed to vehicular traffic. He said PWD officials, after inspecting the bridge, had declared it unsafe and it would take three weeks to undertake the repair work. Several bridges in this industrial belt of Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh have been damaged owing to indiscriminate mining which has failed to be checked."
When life is on the move,"Every year, shepherds and their flocks of sheep travel from Rajasthan to pastures in Haryana

Sunil Phogat

During summer months, one often sees large flocks of sheep grazing in the central regions of Haryana. From a distance, everything looks fine. The envious and carefree life of the nomads, herds of bleating sheep, newborn lambs carefully tucked in the shepherds’ arms… But, a few days spent with them reveal the hard side of the seemingly romantic life. They hail from Rajasthan and tread great lengths and breadths of the north-western and western regions of the country in search of pastures that have now shrunk. Not just Gujjars, they are Muslims, Rajpoots and Jats too. Most of them own sheep, but some rear those of a seth, a rich businessman, for livelihood. They bring hundreds of herds of sheep from Jodhpur, Sirohi, Jalaur and Nagaur every year and enter Haryana from the southern tip near Rewari or Mahendergarh, preferably along the railway track. The journey starts after Makar Sankranti. What brings them here is the fact that agricultural lands that get vacated after the rabi crops have been harvested and fallows offer green fodder. There is enough to feed them throughout the harsh summer as fallow lands in Haryana are seldom used by cattle herds from the state. The shepherds from Rajasthan thus occupy these lands until monsoon hits the region. We get talking to the shepherds who tell us that a healthy and grown up sheep yields about 700g of raw wool in a season. But rearing season is also a season of exploitation by middlemen who keep an eye on their movement and approach them at the onset of shearing season. The rate offered is as low as Rs 20 per sheep per season! A sheep is sheared thrice a year: in February-March, June-July, and November-December. The rate of wool varies in accordance with quality and demand. In lean times, the buying price remains static at Rs 35 to 40 per kilogram. Towards the end of winter, it might double and sometimes sell at Rs 100 per kg. Any little ‘profit’ that the shepherds can make vanishes between the time lag in the three fleecing seasons. The katariya or sheep barber charges Rs 16 per sheep. Besides, the herdsmen incur expenditure on maintenance of the sheep if it ever falls sick. The cost of transportation of one truck load of sheep is Rs 15,000 per journey. The assistant herdsmen are also paid wages. A headman of the shepherds, who we talk to, says the price per kg of wool should not be less than Rs 150 if they have to survive. The shepherds say that with the changing times, herdsmen shun laborious and time-consuming walks to the pastures of Haryana. Animals are now loaded into trucks at Jodhpur and alighted at the border touching Mahendragarh. From there, they usually start their journey into the hinterland of Haryana. Rayees Khan, a shepherd from Jodhpur, tells us that the sheep remain tightly packed in the vehicle’s chamber for 12-14 hours before they reach the borde. Gujjars, with their own flocks of sheep, prefer to travel long distances, often covering 400 miles or more on foot. From Mahendragarh, the shepherds move towards the shepherds move towards Charkhi Dadri and Bhiwani, cross a small stretch of Rohtak or Hissar and then move towards Jind, following the shortest country routes that they are well familiar with after years of travelling to and fro. They keep the sheep in open lands in Jind, Rohtak and Jhajjar districts, in rotation as per the availability of fodder and other vegetation, and stay on for several months. The flocks are taken away for grazing during the day within a radius of 5km from the camp to make the return in the evening easier. The grown up children of the herdsmen join them during vacations in the school. A laggard soon joins the herdsman to follow the age-old tradition. Women and children are taken care of by a couple of elderly persons in the Dera while the herdsmen are away for grazing. Sheep keep healthy and happy in dry season, but despise wet surroundings or rains. Heavy rains, in fact, bring a change in the mood of both the herdsmen and the sheep. While men feel melancholy, the sheep flock together and stand perched on high lands until they shed the last raindrops dangling from their hair. The morass and sticky land damages their hoofs and skin. To experience the same, this June, this writer followed them from dawn to dusk one day. The day began with heavy rains, was followed by scorching heat and ended when the stars lit up the sky. Being a nomad isn’t everyone’s cup of tea.

No benefits

During the 12th five-year, the government of India had set a target of covering 1, 30,000 shepherds and less than a million sheep under the Sheep Breeder’s Insurance Scheme. However, the data about the final outcome could not be known. A large number of sheep and shepherds remained excluded from the beneficiary schemes despite the fact that the Central Wool Development Board releases grant money to NGOs for their welfare.

A meeting best forgotten,"MOVIE REVIEW - JAB HARRY MET SEJAL

Nonika Singh

As the trailers have already revealed, Jab Harry Met Sejal begins on a rather peculiar, almost absurd, note. She has lost her engagement ring, he is going about his life of a tourist guide with business as usual. She seeks, nay forces, herself on him to make her find the lost ring. That’s how Harry and Sejal truly meet, not the most romantic setting and certainly not a revelation when the rest of the film unfolds.

An old fashioned love story rarely packs any surprises, we agree but it does get its love potion right. Trust Imitaz Ali, the love balladeer of modern day romance, to show you the deeper shade of love by cutting across the class and caste divide. Why, he turns around the notion of romance on its head too. Is romance going down on your knees and proposing to your beloved or is it an emotion that emanates from the deepest recess of your heart?

Imitaz often takes us where we can plumb the depths of love and our own hearts through its lovelorn lovers who find themselves through love. The point is does he manage to do the same with his latest offering? The answer sadly is only intermittently, in flashes.

With the Badshah of romance, Shah Rukh Khan, at the helm, you do expect many a moment that will make you go weak in the knees. If you are a true blue SRK fan, he does not disappoint and makes your heart somersault with his adaa, that inimitable look and more. There are no doubts about his charisma or Anushka’s acting capability, who plays the bindass Gujarati lass so well that you are tempted to hum Dil le gai kudi Gujarat di.

Imitaz’s women characters are well rounded and so seems Sejal. But strangely enough she goes all over Europe literally scrounging for the ring.

Yes, indeed, ring is a metaphor for what we seek within us. But in telling this story of lost and found, it tries too hard to be love wise. Certainly love completes us. But there are forced interjections riding on a skeletal storyline that dull your senses rather than filling you with that loving feeling. Within the beauteous environs of Europe, a gifted superstar Shah Rukh Khan and a talented young actor Anushka do keep you engaged. For the first half at least there is some mirth and a fine pace. Thereafter SRK fan or not, it becomes hard to flow with the path the lovers follow.

The template of Imtiaz’s previous films trails this one but with little force and impact. Remember the passionate kiss of Jab We Met? Well, here too love is sealed in a similar fashion. Only Jab Harry Met Sejal isn’t the rollicking ride of Jab We Met which per se isn’t a bad thing. For no two films are meant to be so, only it makes you so wish it were.

This might be Imtiaz Ali’s brand of love as SRK and Anushka have said, only it’s not even half as flavoursome or soulful as his previous outings. A love story that doesn’t make your heart sing and soul soar can hardly be an affair worth remembering. So much so even the delectable song Hawayein written by Irshad Kaamil and composed by Pritam gets lost and can’t hold love in the air."

Every individual is unique and has different financial goals, risk-taking appetite and attitude towards saving/investment.

Anil Chopra

Every individual is unique and has different financial goals, risk-taking appetite and attitude towards saving/investment. However, there are certain fundamental principles of investing which are universally applicable to “one and all”. These principles are also referred as “Thumb Rules” in general parlance.

We are sharing below certain thumb rules which must be kept in mind before making investment/financial decisions.

How much should YOU save

Your monthly savings must be at least 30% of your take home salary/income. Take home salary is computed as net salary after statutory deductions like provident fund and TDS etc. For example, if your gross monthly income is Rs 1 lakh and your take home salary after tax/PF is Rs 70,000 then you must save at least Rs 21,000 every month for investing in your medium to long term goals.

Savings account

Not more than two times of your monthly household budget expenses. If your household expenses budget is Rs 50,000 pm, you should not keep more than Rs 1 lakh balance in your savings account. Please remember that generally savings bank accounts earn interest @ 4% pa and that is not enough even to beat inflation.

Investment in gold

Ideal allocation to gold is around 10% of your financial portfolio.

Financial portfolio includes bank balance, fixed deposits, post office schemes, mutual funds, bonds, shares and stocks etc.

Accordingly, if your financial portfolio (without adding the value of house) is Rs 1 crore, maximum exposure to gold including Gold Mutual Fund or Gold ETF should be Rs 10 lakh. If your investment in gold is less than 10% of your financial portfolio, you may invest in Gold ETF or Gold Mutual Funds rather than buying physical gold which carries risk of being stolen. On the other hand, if your current investment is higher than 10% of your financial portfolio, then at least do not make any fresh investment in gold until your financial portfolio grows and exposure to gold comes down to around 10%.

Allocation to equity

Thumb rule for investing in equity is “100 minus your age” should be the allocation to equity. For example, if your age is 30 years, you may invest up to 70% (100 – 30) of your savings into equity through Equity Mutual Fund Schemes of reputed Asset Management Companies.

Similarly, if your current age is 60 years, you should not invest more than 40% (100–60) of your savings in equity-oriented schemes. As your age continues to grow, you should reduce your exposure to equity.

Debt schemes

As already mentioned, around 10% should be invested in gold, 100 minus your age should be invested in equity and balance should be invested in debt schemes like PPF, debt mutual funds, FMP, bonds, bank deposits etc. For example, if your current age is 50 years then you should invest 50% in equity (100–50), 10% in gold and balance 40% in various debt instruments.

Life insurance coverage

The thumb rule for life insurance coverage amount is at least seven times of your annual income. If your annual salary package is Rs 15 lakh, you must have “sum assured” of at least Rs 1 crore in one or more life insurance plans, including term plan, ULIPs and traditional plans.

Health insurance

For single individual, with no dependents, health insurance coverage of Rs 2 lakh is enough. However, for any couple with or without kids, health insurance coverage should be for minimum Rs 5 lakh and if your old parents are also alive and dependent on you then you must take a family floater plan of Rs 10 lakh.

Mutual funds

If your monthly savings is Rs 10,000, you must have minimum two SIPs of Rs 5,000 each. One in large cap and another mid cap. If your monthly savings is Rs 25,000, you should have five SIPs of Rs 5,000 each out of which two should be large cap, one mid cap, one flexi cap and the last one can be in sectoral SIP like banking or infrastructure etc.

Portfolio review

The thumb rule for reviewing the portfolio is once every three months if your portfolio is larger than Rs 50 lakh and at least twice a year if your portfolio is less than Rs 50 lakh.

Above thumb rules are shared for reference purpose only and to ensure that you should not go “off course” in your journey of wealth creation and achievement of your financial goals. You must consult a certified financial planner or a subject matter expert for taking important financial decisions.

State govt focusing on infra development: Nainital MLA,"Rajinder Nagarkoti

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 4

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat is focusing on infrastructure development in hill regions of the state, said Nainital MLA Sanjeev Arya while speaking with The Tribune here today. Arya, son of Transport Minister Yashpal Arya, said the government was making efforts to improve connectivity of the state with other parts of the country through road and train networks. The government was also working on the ambitious Char Dham all-weather road project announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year. Such type of roads would boost tourism in the state, said 39-year-old Arya. The Prime Minister had laid the foundation stone of the all-weather Rs 11,700-crore road project to connect Char Dham, in Dehradun on December 27. On the migration issue, he said the government was committed to increasing employment opportunities in hill areas, he added. On the demand of starting direct Volvo bus service between Chandigarh and Haldwani via Haridwar, he would take up the issue brought to his notice by various social organization of Uttarakhand based in Chandigarh with the state government. Social activist Surender Halsi said at present the Uttarakhand TransportCorporation is running five Volvo buses between Chandigarh and Uttarakhand and only one is for Haldwani that too via Dehradun. Chandigarh residents were demanding a Volvo bus service between Chandigarh and Haldwani via Haridwar, he added.The government is working on the ambitious Char Dham all-weather road project announced by PM Narendra Modi last year.

July 10 Amarnath yatra attack cracked,"Police name three Pak nationals, one local militant; three arrested for logistic support

Suhail A Shah

Anantnag, August 6

Reiterating that the July 10 attack on Amarnath pilgrims was the handiwork of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, the police today said the attack was carried out by four militants, three of whom were Pakistani nationals. “The militants have been identified as Abu Ismail, alias Haroon, Maaviya and Furqan, all Pakistani nationals, and Yawar Bashir, a Lashkar militant from Kulgam district,” said Muneer Khan, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kashmir, at a press conference today. Ismail had replaced the now slain Lashkar commander Abu Dujana some time back as divisional commander of the outfit, he said. The police had also arrested three civilians on the charge of providing logistic support to the militants, including transport, shelter and active reconnaissance of places for attack. The arrested civilians, whom the IGP insisted should be called ‘militants without guns’, were identified as Bilal Ahmad Reshi, Aijaz Ahmad Wagay and Zahoor Ahmad Sheikh. Giving out details of the investigation, the IGP said the attack was a pure act of terror and a CRPF vehicle might have come under attack instead of the vehicle carrying pilgrims. “The persons arrested provided information regarding movement of yatris as well as CRPF vehicle. They had code names for solitary yatra and CRPF vehicles, which they passed on to the militants,” said the IGP. He insisted that the attack was planned to be carried out on July 9, but no yatri vehicle or CRPF vehicle was moving in isolation that day. “So they carried out the attack on July 10, hitting the fateful bus moving in isolation,” he added. Eight yatris were killed and 30 injured after the militants fired indiscriminately at their vehicle in the Battengoo area of Anantnag district on the evening of July 10. The IGP said the investigation was over and the case had been cracked. “The next step is to neutralise the militants involved in the attack. That will be done soon,” he maintained. A special investigation team headed by the Deputy Inspector General, south Kashmir range, had been set up to carry out the investigation into the attack."
"US, Australia, Japan slam Chinese island-building","The United States, Australia and Japan on Monday denounced Beijing’s island-building and militarisation of the South China Sea, in contrast to the increasingly tepid response from Southeast Asian nations over the festering issue.

China claims nearly all of the sea, through which $5 trillion in annual shipping trade passes and which is believed to sit atop vast oil and gas deposits.

Its sweeping claims overlap with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei—all members of the 10- nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc—as well as Taiwan.

But in recent years Beijing has managed to weaken regional resistance by courting some ASEAN members.

Yesterday, Beijing scored a coup when ASEAN ministers issued a diluted statement on the dispute and agreed to Beijing’s terms on talks during a security forum which the bloc is hosting in Manila.

China insists that a much-delayed code of conduct between it and ASEAN members over the disputed sea must not be legally binding, a demand to which Southeast Asian countries have so far acquiesced.

But in a joint statement after their foreign ministers met on the sidelines of the same gathering, the US, Japan and Australia delivered a noticeably sterner rebuke to Beijing.

Criticising ongoing “land reclamation, construction of outposts, militarisation of disputed features” in the disputed sea, the trio said any code of conduct must be “legally binding, meaningful and effective”, a demand noticeably absent from the ASEAN statement.

The three nations also called on China and the Philippines to respect last year’s international arbitration ruling which dismissed much of Beijing’s claim in the sea.

The Philippines had been one of the most vocal critics of China and filed a case before a UN-backed tribunal.

But after the election of President Rodrigo Duterte last year, Manila has played down the verdict in favour of pursuing warmer ties with Beijing, a move that led to offers of billions of dollars in investments or aid from China.

Critics of China have accused it of assiduously dividing ASEAN, which operates on a consensus basis, with strong-arm tactics and chequebook diplomacy, enticing smaller countries in the bloc such as Cambodia and Laos to support it.

Vietnam, which had been pushing for stronger language in Manila, has been largely left to fend for itself since Duterte’s China rapprochement.

The US, Australia and Japan oppose Beijing building giant artificial islands that could be used as military bases, fearing it will eventually establish de facto control over the waters.

China insists the three countries should stay out of what it says are purely bilateral disputes with its neighbours.

Yesterday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned any interference from “outside parties” could jeopardise negotiations over the code of conduct. — AFP"
Ethical or otherwise?,"The recent spate of layoffs in the IT sector have lead to a debate over the fairness of these decisions. Are IT companies justified in dumping employees almost unceremoniously?

Geetu Vaid

Layoffs by IT companies, big as well as small, over the past few months has assumed alarming proportions now. Though initially disregarded even by NAASCOM as a routine exercise by the IT companies, something which was not supposed to have an effect on the hiring as well as job scenario in the IT sector, the lay off trickle has transformed into a heavy downpour which is difficult to be swept under the carpet any longer. Recent data figures show significant reduction in the workforce in the major IT companies in the quarter ending in June, 2017. The country’s largest job creator and $154 billion sector is suddenly an uncertain ground for its workforce. Besides stringent visa norms for US and Brexit, the key factor behind layoffs is rapid automation and failure to keep up with the changing technology by the work force. Several traditional job roles have suddenly become redundant and companies are looking for people with niche skills rather than a broad-based portfolio. In such a scenario many of the mid-level executives have been handed over the pink slips with “low performance” being the reason given for discontinuing their services, while the hiring of freshers has also been curtailed heavily. With india’s Silicon Valley, Bengaluru, suddenly becoming the hub of protests by those affected by the retrenchment move, the debate over the ethical and legal aspects of these layoffs is raging. “There has always been a churn in every IT Company, on a year-on-year basis, either at the annual Performance Appraisal cycles or when projects are not very good and employees, too, had a limited view of loyalty for such employment. The deficit between hires Vs exits was a common phenomenon and is now being highlighted only when the industry is experiencing difficulties”, says Subramanyam, CEO of Ascent HR. He, however, maintains that whole blame should not be transferred to the employer as the IT employees have been changing jobs for better prospects till now. According to Subramanya Sirish Tamvada, Dean, IFIM Law College, “As long as the companies follow the law, retrenchment is not illegal however, it may be unethical. There are people who are dependent on these jobs, they have financial commitments such as repayment of loans; health care expenses of old parents or daughter or sister marriage at home”. “ The case of RIF or reduction in force as the industry refers to it can not be termed legal given the framework in India today. But this is an industry that thrives on opportunity than structured planning and hence using the word unreasonable for this act of the industry appears harsh”, maintains Subramanyam.Any employee qualifying as workmen can raise an industrial dispute and contest the action of the employer in asking someone to go or essentially retrench. According to Tamvada the employees can take legal recourse in case there is non-compliance on the part of the employers. “If the company has not followed the due process of law, then that company will be held liable and strict action should be taken against them”, he says. “The labour laws in India are quite stringent and well structured to handle any act of oppression of workmen. The question comes only when an person is a senior employee designated possibly as Director or Vice President is asked to go and whether the person can invoke the right of a workman under the law? The answer would be largely No, and he may need to seek recourse within the terms of the Contract of employment or Service”, explains Subramanyam. “Laying off hundreds and thousands of people in one go is shocking and definitely unethical and it does not build confidence in our system and particularly in the IT sector”, adds Tamvada.

Point of Law

The workman has been given one month’s notice in writing indicating the reasons for retrenchment and the period of notice has expired or the workman has been paid lieu of such notice, wages for such period of the notice

The workman has been paid, at the time of retrenchment, compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days’ average pay for every completed year of continuous service or any part thereof in excess of six months; and

Notice in the prescribed manner is served on the appropriate government or such authority as may be specified by the appropriate Government by notification in the official gazette.

Popular misconception is that industrial laws in the country do not apply to IT and ITES companies. In HR Adyanthaya v. Sandoz (India) Ltd., the Supreme Court in 1994 decided that the definition of workman includes ‘a person to be workman under the industrial disputes act must be employed to do the work of any of the categories viz, manual, skilled, technical, operational, clerical or supervisory. However, people in managerial positions are exempted.

The law relating to retrenchment is provided under Section 2 (oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (ID Act). Retrenchment means termination of service of an employee by an employer for any reason other than as a punishment due to disciplinary action. This does not include — voluntary retirement, superannuation, non-renewal of contract, termination on the ground of continued ill health. There are certain conditions to be met before retrenchment of workforce. Section 25F of the ID Act provides that: Any workman employed in any industry who has been in continuous service of not less than one year under an employer shall b retrenched by that employer until:"
"The Tribune, Chandigarh, Mohali, Panchkula news","CHANDIGARH: Investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the arrest of an HCS officer, posted as SDM (East), her husband and a middleman while allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 75,000, has revealed that the middleman had come in contact with the officer using links of higher officials.

Chandigarh, August 6

Investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the arrest of an HCS officer, posted as SDM (East), her husband and a middleman while allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 75,000, has revealed that the middleman had come in contact with the officer using links of higher officials. The role of one more officer in the SDM’s office, whose name has cropped up, will also be investigated by CBI sleuths.

All three accused were produced before the Duty Magistrate, who remanded the HCS officer and the middleman in one-day custody while the officer’s husband was sent to judicial custody.

The complainant in the case, Tarsem Kumar, had alleged that there was a property dispute between him and his brother and the matter was listed for hearing in the court of SDM (East) Shilpi Pattar. The property dispute was reportedly decided by the SDM on August 3, directing that the disputed property at the grain market in Sector 26 be sealed, without hearing the complainant. The property was sealed by the police the same day.

According to the CBI, the complainant discussed the case with GS Brar, who took him to the SDM’s office. It was also alleged that Brar told the complainant that the SDM would revoke her decision provided the complainant paid a bribe of Rs 5 lakh to her. The bribe amount was reduced to Rs 2 lakh.

The CBI laid a trap and caught Brar and the SDM while taking Rs 75,000 as the first instalment. SDM’s husband Dheeraj Dutt was also arrested as Rs 50,000 of the bribe money was recovered from him while Rs 25,000 was recovered from Brar. CBI sources said the SDM’s husband tried to hide the money in his undergarments.

Rs 2 lakh recovered from SDM’s house

A search conducted at the SDM’s house in Sector 27 led to the recovery of Rs 2 lakh, bank locker keys and documents pertaining to bank accounts.

Another officer under the scanner

Sources said during the probe, it came to light that Brar came in contact with the SDM by using links of higher officials, which had to be investigated. CBI sleuths will also question the officer whom the complainant was asked to meet by the SDM to get the work done.

SDM’s husband seen smiling

While SDM Shilpi Pattar had moist eyes, there was no sign of remorse on her husband’s face, who was seen smiling outside the Duty Magistrate’s house in Sector 19.

Over 30 cases pending in SDM’s court

More than 30 cases of violation and misuse of property are pending in the court of SDM (East) Shilpi Patter Dutt. SDMs have been delegated the powers of the Estate Officer by the UT to hear cases of violation of building bylaws. All buildings are covered under the Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulation) Act, 1952, implemented in the city. The Estate Officer first issues a notice to the owner if violation of building bylaws is found during checking. If the owner fails to remove the violations after the notice, the SDM can seal the building. The Estate Officer also has the power to de-seal the building ."
This is how birds get their colour,"New Delhi

There are about 18,000 bird species on Earth, and every species is differently coloured.

While some birds are so bright in colour, one can spot them from afar, some are coloured so as to camouflage- you'll never realise if you're even looking at the bird! The feathers are composed of intricate combinations of mottles, scales, bars, and spots, making each one unique.

It has already been discovered that different patterns and colours help camouflage the birds from predators, but have you ever wondered how they get such different colours?

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

Dr Ismael Galván and his team of expert researchers conducted a study on about 9,000 bird species' plumage coloration to answer the very question. Two types of pigments are responsible for the pumage coloration: melanins, which produce a range of black, grey, brown, and orange colors, and carotenoids, which are used by specialised feather structures to generate brighter color hues.

Carotenoids, present in certain food items, circulate through the bloodstream and to the feather follicles when birds consume such food items. The birds cannot produce carotenoids, nor can they exercise direct cellular control of synthesizing and depositing carotenoids. The specialized feather structures react to the consumed carotenoids with a mechanism that is not regulated by specialized cells.

Melanins, on the other hand, are synthesised by in the birds' bodies in special cells called ""melanocytes,"" which work together with feather follicles to achieve a fine control of pigmentation. Although carotenoids are more frequently researched in the study of bird coloration, Dr Galván and group are the first to test whether melanins are indeed the only pigmentary element that birds' bodies directly control on a cellular level.

Galván says, ""Knowing beforehand that different pigments and structures produce different types of colors in feathers, we examined the appearance of the plumage of all species of extant birds and determined if the color patches that they contain are produced by melanins or by other pigmentary elements. We also identified those plumage patterns that can be considered complex, defining them as those formed by combinations of two or more discernible colors that occur more than two times uninterruptedly through the plumage."" According to the researchers, 32% of the species studied have complex plumage patterns, with the vast majority of these complex patterns produced by melanins rather than carotenoids. In other words, carotenoids produce color patches, whereas melanins produce intricate patterns.

However, there are exceptions: Fruit doves, cotingas and one type of stork have complex plumage patterns without melanins. Their unusual colors appear to be produced by their bodies making metabolic modifications to the carotenoid pigments that they consume. —ANI"
