US: Police arrests two professors in brutal stabbing of Chicago man,"This undated file photo released by the Chicago Police Department shows Wyndham Lathem, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.

A Northwestern University professor and a University of Oxford employee wanted in the brutal stabbing death of a Chicago man were arrested in California on Friday and will be returned to Chicago for interrogation, federal and local authorities said Friday. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were arrested without incident and were in custody in Oakland, California.

Lathem, an associate microbiology professor at Northwestern, surrendered at the federal courthouse in Oakland, according to the Chicago Tribune, which quoted U.S. Marshals Service supervisory inspector Ed Farrell. Warren, a resident at Somerville College, a part of the Oxford University Network, was arrested in San Francisco, Farrell said. Chicago police said the two would go before an Oakland court and then be returned to Chicago, where they would be interrogated by homicide detectives. Police did not say when that would happen.

A manhunt had been underway since first-degree murder warrants were issued for the two men shortly after the body of 26-year-old Trenton James Cornell-Duranleau was found on July 27 riddled with stab wounds in the Chicago apartment where Lathem lived. “Both individuals will be held accountable for their actions and we hope today’s arrest brings some comfort for the victim’s family,” a Chicago police statement said.

Police said earlier on Friday that Lathem had sent a video to friends and relatives apologizing for his involvement in the crime, which he called the “biggest mistake of my life.” The video raised concern among investigators that Lathem might kill himself. “We are also thankful both men are safely in custody and this did not end in further tragedy,” the police statement said.

Warren had arrived in the United States three days before the death of Cornell-Duranleau and was seen in surveillance video leaving the building with Lathem the day of the stabbing. Police had released few details of the investigation. But they also said on Friday that on the day of the slaying – but before the body was discovered – Lathem and Warren drove about 80 miles (128 kilometers) northwest to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where one of them made a $1,000 cash donation to the public library there in Cornell-Duranleau’s name. Lake Geneva police said the man making the donation did not give his name.

“I’ve never seen where suspects in a homicide would make a donation in the victim’s name,” said Lake Geneva police Lt. Edward Gritzner.

Police said Lathem had a personal relationship with Cornell-Duranleau, who moved to Chicago from the Grand Rapids, Michigan, area after receiving his cosmetology license. They said they were still trying to determine how Cornell-Duranleau or Lathem knew Warren, or if Warren knew them before he flew to the United States before the stabbing.

They have said that on the night of the slaying the front desk of the high-rise building where Lathem lives in Chicago’s trendy River North neighborhood received an anonymous call from a person who said that a crime had been committed in Lathem’s 10th floor apartment. When police opened the door they found Cornell-Duranleau’s body. He had been stabbed several times in an attack so brutal that police said the knife broke.

Police also said that by the time they found the body on the night of July 27, Cornell-Duranleau had been dead for 12-15 hours.

Fifth column: Erasing history is no solution,"More venomous tweeters spewed bile against ‘libtards’ for their deafening silence about violence against Hindus in Kerala and West Bengal. (PTI Photo/Representational) More venomous tweeters spewed bile against ‘libtards’ for their deafening silence about violence against Hindus in Kerala and West Bengal. (PTI Photo/Representational)

A video of a man dying horribly on a hospital bed with both his chopped hands placed between his bloodied legs has been viral on social media. Horrified though I was by the video, I withheld comment because of having been eviscerated for posting a doctored picture of Yogi Adityanath. Then, reliable sources confirmed that it was indeed of an RSS man in Thiruvananthapuram, so I expressed my horror on Twitter, only to be assailed by the same Hindutva tweeters who have attacked me every time I have written against the lynchings by cow vigilantes.

This time their rage was caused by the silence of the NotInMyName crowd. Out of a misconception that I was part of this group, they taunted me for not protesting loudly enough. ‘What if this man had been a Muslim?’ they tweeted angrily. More venomous tweeters spewed bile against ‘libtards’ for their deafening silence about violence against Hindus in Kerala and West Bengal. As someone who is fundamentally horrified by all mob violence, I have spent a considerable amount of time trying to understand why usually sane people ask the religion or caste of a victim before deciding if they are sickened by his brutal murder.

My musings on this mystery intensified during a visit to Berlin two weeks ago. It was my first visit to this city so I spent my time there doing the usual tourist things and was surprised to discover that these mostly included Jewish memorials and museums. It was almost impossible to go anywhere without being reminded in some way of what Hitler did to the Jews.

The first place I was told to visit was the Jewish memorial near the Brandenburg Gate that is an endless expanse of grey concrete tombs. Then I visited a permanent exhibition that exists on a section of what used to be the Berlin wall, that tells in black and white pictures the story of what happened here when the Nazis ruled and the consequences of the evil they wrought when the war ended. So pervasive is the presence of this city’s brutal history that when I dined in a restaurant in the old Jewish quarter, I was reminded that it was once a school for Jewish girls.

At the end of my stay in Berlin I found myself wondering if the historic grievances between Hindus and Muslims in India could not best be solved by remembrance. Hindus believe that now that there is a Hindu Prime Minister instead of the secular kind, it is their time to avenge the wounds of history. The Prime Minister and his chief ministers seem to understand this sentiment, so they have been shamefully silent in the face of every new lynching.

When they have spoken against the cow vigilante lynchings, their words have been so mild and so ambiguous that it has become difficult to know if they secretly support what the vigilantes are doing. Whenever I have spoken to RSS leaders they have admitted honestly that they like the fact that Hindus are no longer afraid to kill Muslims. What comes through in these conversations is rage mixed with a deep grievance.

In Muslim communities from Kashmir to Kerala there is today fear, anger and an alienation that I personally have never seen before. I say this as someone who spent my reporting years covering communal riots whenever they happened, and in those ‘secular’ times major riots happened at least once a year.

But, when they ended, there was a sad sort of closure and everyone went back to the normal business of living. This closure is no longer possible because after every lynching we wait for the next and the next. And when it happens, Hindutva types spew venom against the media for daring to pay too much attention only because the victims are Muslims.

So some kind of closure has become necessary and I believe that it can come from remembering history rather than erasing it. The vehicle of remembrance is something that the Prime Minister needs to work on, but he could begin by holding a conference of major religious leaders from all our major religions. To this conference should be invited not just faith leaders but leaders of political, social and cultural organisations. Get them all to define the way forward. Let the historians come as well, from both the left and the right, and let them highlight the erasures and the lies that government historians have told in the name of secularism.

This is only one way of beginning the process of remembrance. There must be others and they need to be discussed in every forum if we are to stop these hate crimes from multiplying to such a degree that India will once more become vulnerable to being broken for the sake of someone’s faith.

"US Senators head home, and block Donald Trump’s recess appointments","US President Donald Trump. (Source: Reuters) US President Donald Trump. (Source: Reuters)

The US Senate adjourned leaving Donald Trump deprived of any major legislative victory heading into summer break, as lawmakers also blocked the president from making so-called recess appointments during the rest period. The move, by unanimous consent of the 100 senators, serves as a check on Trump as he mulls firing his Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Trump has considered replacing his embattled top law enforcement official amid broadening investigations into allegations that his aides coordinated with Russia to tilt last year’s election in his favor. The president has strongly criticized Sessions for recusing himself from the probe, and speculation swirled over whether Trump would ram through a replacement during the break, without Senate confirmation.

But that avenue closed Thursday when Senator Lisa Murkowski, adjourning the Senate for the day, locked in nine “pro forma” sessions over the next month. Such sessions typically last a minute or two, with no business conducted. Holding them keeps the Senate open during the vacation period, denying the president recess appointment opportunities.

The House of Representatives adjourned for its break last week. As summer-bound US lawmakers exit Washington, the numbers are telling: with Trump in office seven months, and his Republican Party controlling all three branches of government, Congress has passed zero pieces of major legislation.

The Republicans’ over-promised effort to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s health care reforms collapsed in embarrassing shambles. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had hoped to triumph on a health bill last month, leaving time to accomplish other goals including raising the US debt ceiling and working on budget bills for fiscal year 2018.

But the health care fiasco sucked up weeks of debate time, and its cascading effect stalled other legislation.

Republicans do claim some victories, including confirming conservative judge Neil Gorsuch onto the Supreme Court, rescinding several Obama-era regulations and improving conditions for veterans. One top accomplishment was the Russia sanctions bill that passed with overwhelming support, leading Trump to sign the measure into law despite not backing it.

And yesterday Republicans got unanimous consent from the chamber to confirm more than 60 nominees, including US ambassadors to Britain and Canada and a new representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But otherwise they now head home with few accomplishments, and likely to face conservatives angry at their failure to repeal Obamacare.

Number two Senate Republican John Cornyn signaled the health fight was not over.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin goes fishing ‘shirtless’ in Siberia, Twitterati have a field day","The Internet cannot get enough of Putin’s shirtless pictures. (Source: THE Newt Scamander/ Twitter) The Internet cannot get enough of Putin’s shirtless pictures. (Source: THE Newt Scamander/ Twitter)

Many social media users might be obsessed with US President Donald Trump and his handshakes, but Russian President Vladimir Putin is not far behind. From taking a walk with Narendra Modi in a park and giving us new ‘friendship goals’ to his tete-a-tete with Trump at the G20 and reminding people strangely of a scene from the television drama series House of Cards, Putin has time and again given enough fodder to the Internet to obsess over him.

And things are no different this time. The Russian President is on a three-day fishing and hunting holiday at the Siberian wilderness, and pictures of Putin took social media by storm.

While they do look like any other holiday pictures, the only difference was Putin was shirtless and braved the cold waters of a mountain lake. The pictures and the video footage released by the Kremlin on Saturday were soon spun into countless memes.

Here are some of the images.

The pictures and the video footage floating online show the President spear-fishing, swimming and sunbathing along with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. The hunting and fishing expedition took place in the republic of Tyva in southern Siberia, on the Mongolian border, located some 3,700 km east of Moscow. Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesman told reporters,“The water in the lake doesn’t get warmer than 17 degrees, but this didn’t stop the president from going for a swim.”

Hospital denies treatment to gunshot victim: Delhi HC seeks Govt reply,"Delhi High Court (File Photo) Delhi High Court (File Photo)

The Delhi High Court has sought the response of the government and the Delhi Police on a PIL initiated by it on the basis of a report that a gunshot victim was denied treatment by a private hospital fearing harassment from cops. A bench of Justices G S Sistani and Chander Shekhar asked the Centre and the police to file their replies and status reports before the next date of hearing on August 11.

The PIL was initiated by the high court after the news report was brought to its attention by a lawyer who sought directions to hospitals, both private and government-run, not to deny treatment in such cases. The lawyer, Varun Gosain, has also sought directions from the court to the police for a speedy probe and proper protection to the eye-witnesses, as four of the five accused in the incident are still absconding.

According o the report, a 57-year-old dhaba owner and his 26-year-old son were shot dead allegedly by five men after a dispute over a cooler in outer Delhi’s Najafgarh area on the night of July 26. The accused wanted the cooler to be turned towards them but the dhaba owner, Shyam Verma, and his son Mayank did not agree, which led to a fight.

One of the persons in the group of five allegedly pulled out a pistol and shot Mayank in the neck and when his father tried to stop them, he was shot in the head. While the dhaba owner died on the spot, his son succumbed to injuries later, the report had said.

The report had also quoted one of the relatives of the victims as saying that Mayank would have survived if the first hospital where he was taken would have admitted him.

The British Library is digitising rare printed Bengali books,"To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo) To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo)

The British Library, which is leading an international partnership to digitise rare material from its South Asian printed book collection, has scanned 1,000 old and rare printed Bengali books of the 19th century, according to project co-ordinators.

As part of the ‘Two Centuries of Indian Print’ (TCIP) project, in total, 4,000 early printed Bengali books, amounting to more than 800,000 pages, will be digitised and made freely available online.

“So far we scanned 1,000 books. There are books literally from every discipline you could think of. There are treatises on sciences, education, religion, missionaries coming to India and translation of the Bible,” Tom Derrick, Digital Curator, TCIP told IANS here at the Jadavpur University on the sidelines of a symposium exploring the history of print in South Asia.

The TCIP pilot project is a partnership between the British Library, the School of Cultural Texts and Records (SCTR) of Jadavpur University, Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, and the Library at SOAS University of London, involving collaborations with the National Library of India.

It marks the start of a major programme to share the wealth of Indian printed books held by the British Library dating from 1713 to 1914. Another aspect to the project is applying OCR (optical character recognition) to transcribe the Bengali script. OCR is the recognition of printed or written text characters by a computer.

“We are dealing with historical Bangla and the changes in the language, so the typography is unique. It is underserved by commercial OCR whose focus is more on Western patterns,” explained Derrick.

To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. “So over 20 institutes worldwide have signed up,” he said. According to Layli Uddin, project curator (Bengali) at the British Library, the approach is three-pronged: cataloguing, digitising and contextualising.

“We want to reach out to a wider audience, make the materials open and free to all, make it accessible to non-Bengali speaking audiences as well. Also to contextualise and that is where the Jadavpur University experts come in. They are helping identify what is unique and rare in BL’s collectionsa printed materials which are not available elsewhere in the world,” Uddin told IANS.

Abhijit Gupta, joint director, SCTR, says the the thinner the book, the rarer they are.

“The British Library used a unique mechanisma they used to bind together thin books to preserve them. One of the rare books that is part of the project is ‘Advice for Railway Travellers’ which gives information on railway schedule after the advent of railways. The point of digitising is to access part of the landscape which we know exists but we can’t seea they are in libraries across the world.” added Gupta.

Goutham Nanda movie review: This Gopichand film insults the intelligence of the audience,"Goutham Nanda movie review Goutham Nanda movie review

Goutham Nanda movie cast: Gopichand, Hansika Motwani, Catherine Tresa

Goutham Nanda movie director: Sampath Nandi

Goutham Nanda movie rating: 1 star

Gopichand, who was last seen in 2015 film Soukhyam, returns to the silver screen after a gap of two years. Goutham Nanda was expected to give Gopichand a much-needed break at the box office. Instead, it is the audience who ends up craving for a break from the incoherent and nonsensical attempt at storytelling.

Goutham (Gopichand) is born with a silver spoon. He is the only son of a business tycoon played by Sachin Khedekar. Goutam leads a life of excess with his father’s blessing. His father even calls him to complain as to why his monthly bill is less than a million, and advises him to spend more.

Director Sampath Nandi has whipped up a cringeworthy story and uninteresting lead characters. Goutham, accompanied by beautiful girls, is introduced with a song shot in picturesque foreign locations. The first song is also an attempt to advise the audience to live life happily without worrying about the future and has words like “Hey Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara.” Ironically, the director did not seem to have a problem in showing Goutham snorting cocaine off a girl’s shoulder.

Sampath may argue that this film is about a spoiled brat who turns into a responsible citizen after a reality check. But, the problem in the story is such a huge transformation in a character takes a long time and extraordinary efforts from the character itself. It’s highly unconvincing when Sampath tries to sell an idea that a crackhead can turn over a new leaf overnight.

It feels like there is no connection between Goutham’s character and his actions. The only scene where Goutham’s character is convincing is when he plans to crash his car into a big truck so he can feel the pain. That’s how a person who snorts cocaine would think.

Goutham has everything but he claims he has never experienced true emotions in his life that made him incapable of knowing who he is truly. So, he decides to kill himself. After he survives the car crash, he hits Nanda (Gopichand, again). Nanda also jumped in front of Goutham’s car to commit suicide because of his financial problems. Do you see where the director is going with it?

As you may have guessed, Goutham comes up with a plan of trading places with Nanda so that he can get a 30-day crash course in poverty. Goutham goes to Nanda’s house located in a low-life area in Hyderabad, while Nanda to Goutham’s castle in Bengaluru.

From there on, Goutham’s self-discovering journey becomes a tedious watch. It is like the moment Goutham steps into Nanda’s house, he achieves such a maturity that he no longer needs money or cocaine to be happy or live life to its fullest. And again, it is highly difficult to buy a second of Goutham and Nanda as characters.

And this unconvincing tale of two sides of the same coin leads to an obvious end that we saw coming a mile away.

While both the characters are forgettable, Gopichand’s performance as Nanda is an oasis in the barren stretch. Hansika Motwani as Spoorthi plays an ideal girlfriend and her character has very limited scope to make any mark. Catherine Tresa as Mugdha plays a party girl and that’s about it.

Goutham Nanda exposes director-writer Sampath, who seems incapable of creativity and logical thinking. It also shows his conviction that as long as the package is fancy, the audience will lap up any story thrown at them. Goutham Nanda is one of those commercial films that insult the intelligence of the audience.

"Ravindra Jadeja impersonates Murali Kartik’s bowling action, watch video","Ravindra Jadeja picked up his 150th Test wicket on Saturday. (Source: AP) Ravindra Jadeja picked up his 150th Test wicket on Saturday. (Source: AP)

Ravindra Jadeja is popular for running throw his overs in quick time. India’s over-rate has been very healthy when R Ashwin and Jadeja bowl in tandem. With a short run-up and quick arm action that is not complicated, Jadeja is one bowler with a simple action. But, he tried tweaking it on Saturday.

Before the start of play on the third day of the second Test between India and Sri Lanka in Colombo on Saturday, Jadeja was seen bowling at the nets. Present there was also former India left-arm spinner Murali Kartik.

While Kartik was standing besides the pitch, Jadeja was bowling and before one delivery, Jadeja switches to a new bowling action — that of Kartik. He impersonated Kartik and bowled one delivery that went over the stumps.

Jadeja became the fastest to reach 150 Test wickets among left-arm bowlers as he reached the feat in his 32nd Test. He picked up the first wicket of Sri Lanka’s innings on the third day of the Test when he had Dinesh Chandimal caught at square-leg in the fifth over of the day.

Sri Lanka resumed their innings at 50 for 2 and 572 runs behind India’s first innings total of 622 for 9 declared. But, R Ashwin picked up a five-wicket haul, his 26th in Test cricket, as India bowled out Sri Lanka for 183 in the first innings.

India took a lead of 439 runs and enforced follow-on over Sri Lanka. The visitors lead the series 1-0 after winning the Galle Test by 304 runs.

Shots fired as Myanmar forces raid Rohingya village,"The major part of the military crackdown on the militants ended several months ago. But the area remains locked down, with sporadic killings by troops and almost daily reports in state media of villagers being murdered and abducted by masked assassins . The major part of the military crackdown on the militants ended several months ago. But the area remains locked down, with sporadic killings by troops and almost daily reports in state media of villagers being murdered and abducted by masked assassins .

Myanmar security forces fired warning shots during a day-long sweep of a Rohingya village to arrest alleged militants, Aung San Suu Kyi’s office said, as violence again tremored through Rakhine State. The northwestern area has been beset by unrest since late last year when Rohingya militants attacked police posts, prompting a months-long bloody military crackdown that the UN believes may amount to ethnic cleansing.

The major part of the military crackdown on the militants ended several months ago. But the area remains locked down, with sporadic killings by troops and almost daily reports in state media of villagers being murdered and abducted by masked assassins. Border police began an operation on Friday morning in Out Nan Yar village arresting “six criminals” accused of supporting the militants, according to a statement from the office of State Counsellor Suu Kyi.

Around two dozen officers were surrounded by a hundreds-strong “mob” of villagers armed with rudimentary weapons. Four of the suspects were freed in the ensuing chaos. “Police had to fire around 40-50 warning shots as the mob attacked with sling shots, sticks and knives,” the statement said, adding military columns were moving into the village as night fell.

Violence in the hard to access wedge of Rakhine closest to Bangladesh has seen tens of thousands of Rohingya flee across the border. Myanmar’s government has denied accusations that its security forces killed and raped Rohingya villagers during its “clearance operations”.

But it has also steadfastly refused to allow in a UN fact-finding mission to investigate allegations of widespread abuse collected from survivors who fled the area. Six Buddhists from the ethnic Myo minority were killed on Thursday as violence continues to stalk the zone.

Haq, a resident of Chennai, was intercepted in February while he was allegedly smuggling gold from Myanmar and entered the Northeast by road. He was intercepted by the DRI with 20 gold bricks weighing 3.5 kg. “Haq is accused of sending money to IS and its fighters in Syria through Dubai based Jameel Ahmed,” ATS officials said.

“There is conclusive proof that Haq is an IS member, collected money for terrorist activities, conspired in running terrorist activities and supported the said terrorist organisation,” the ATS said in a statement.

Usain Bolt closes 100 metres career with bronze medal,"Usain Bolt is competing in his final event before calling time next week. (Source: Reuters) Usain Bolt is competing in his final event before calling time next week. (Source: Reuters)

Usain Bolt drew curtain on his 100 metres career at the IAAF World Athletics Championship by clinching the bronze medal in London – the venue for his Olympic record in 2012 – by registering a time of 9.95 seconds. He was stunned by an emotional Justin Gatlin of USA and Christian Coleman of USA who took home the gold and silver medals respectively with times of 9.92 and 9.94 seconds. Bolt was eyeing a fourth gold medal at the World Athletics Championship. However he will look to finish on a high next week with the sprint relay team event.

“It wasn’t a perfect race. My start let me down … it’s just one of those things & it happens. It was brilliant, a great career,” said Bolt in an interaction with French TV after the race.

Gatlin who has been drawing jeers for his doping suspensions over the years was booed in the semifinals and then once again in the finals but he came good when it mattered most. The former world and Olympic champion Gatlin who stumbled at the death to lose the 2015 world final to Bolt, timed his surge and dip to perfection. Later while speaking to the BBC he said, “I stayed the course and kept my energy through the semis and into the finals and did what I had to do. The people who love me, are here cheering for me, they’re at home cheering for me and across the country are cheering for me. And that’s all I focused on.”

“It’s a surreal moment. I thought about the things I would do if I did win and I didn’t do any of that. It was like 2004 all over again. I won by a little margin and be able to cross the line is exciting. It still has been an amazing night because it is Usain Bolt’s last race. To have so many victories and so many losses but to be able to run against him through the years, is an amazing night,” he added on an emotional response at the end of the race.

“We’re rivals on the the track but away from it and when we’re not competing, we just have a good time and joke with each other. He said ‘Congratulations! You’ve worked hard for this. You don’t deserve all these boo’s.’ I thanked him for that and thanked him for inspiring me throughout my career. He’s an amazing man,” said Gatlin.

In the semifinals earlier, Bolt only qualified for the finals after finishing second in Heat 3 with a time of 9.98 qualified. He finished only 0.01 seconds slower than Coleman in the third heat. In the end, Coleman’s time of 9.97 seconds was the best of the semifinals with Bolt finishing second. Other key contenders for the medals were Yohan Blake (10.04 seconds), Gatlin (10.09 seconds). Gatlin matched Coleman’s 9.92 seconds which was the season’s best coming into the Championship. On the same day, Bolt had been beaten twice and it was only the first time in four years that Bolt had been beaten in 100 metres.

New British champion Reece Prescod had given the 56,000 crowd a reason to cheer when he blitzed in the last 20 metres to seize automatic qualification for his first major final. But he couldn’t replicate that in the final to finish with 10.17 seconds.

Iraq finds mass grave in former IS-held city,"(Representational Image) (Representational Image)

Iraqi troops have found a mass grave in the western city of Ramadi containing the bodies of 40 men believed to have been executed by the Islamic State group, officials said today.

It is the latest of dozens of such grisly finds made by Iraqi forces since they drove the jihadists out of the swathes of northern and western Iraq that they occupied in 2014.

Ammar Nuri al-Dulaimi, an official from a Martyrs Committee for Anbar province, said the bodies had bullet wounds to the head, suggesting they were executed by IS.

An army colonel, who asked not to be named, said troops had uncovered the mass grave during a sweep of the Al-Tach neighbourhood in the south of Ramadi, capital of the province. The army retook the city in December 2015.

BATTLEGROUND ASIA BOXING UPDATES:

2219 hrs IST: Vijender: “I didn’t expect this fight. I didn’t play my game and some of the attempts by him were unsporting.”

“I don’t want this title because I don’t want tension at the border (between India and China)”

2214 hrs IST: DECISION:

JUDGE 1: 96-93

JUDGE 2: 95-94

JUDGE 3: 95-94

WINNER: VIJENDER SINGH IN UNANIMOUS DECISION

2209 hrs IST: Vijender Singh not in the right frame now or even today. The Indian boxer is struggling and needs something magical in the last minute and half to turn things around but at this stage it looks unlikely. Another possible unsporting hit from Zulpikar and another break. Officials checking but it has begun again. Zulpikar with flurry of punches to try and end on the high.

2205 hrs IST: Into the ninth round. Vijender slips and goes down once again. Chants of “cheater, cheater” by the crowd. Zulpikar with a lower blow into the Vijender midriff and this results in the Indian going down. Blood is pouring out of Vijender’s nose and he seems to be low on confidence

2157 hrs IST: Staying level so far. Into the eighth round with neither boxers able to create a serious opening or find a defensive loophole to make the most of. Zulpikar staying in it with jabs after another.

2154 hrs IST: Vijender went down and Zulpikar tried to make the most of it with a left handed jab but the referee seems to indicate that there wasn’t much in it. However on the whole that seemed to be a good round for the Chinese boxer

2147 hrs IST: It’s getting hot here. Both men going hard at each other and making the most of little space at their disposal. Vijender with flurry of punches and got some in response but nothing concrete. Spectacular for the crowd

2144 hrs IST: Zulpikar with a great fourth round. Getting some neat punches into Vijender’s body, into the midriff. And then the Chinese boxer loses his balance to go down onto the canvas. Vijender comes back to sting Zulpikar. But a contentious moment there. A lower blow and the referee needs to intervene

2142 hrs IST: Little to show for in the third round. Vijender slipped at the end of the third round. But nothing to worry about as it wasn’t a jab or anything damaging from Zulpikar. Both men seeking a real opening so far

2135 hrs IST: Second round underway and Vijender gets some meaty blows into Zulpikar’s face. Crowd applauds the action and that round will go into the Indian boxer’s favour

2131 hrs IST: Reminder that this will be a bout of maximum ten rounds. And we’re go. Vijender with trunks in the Indian colours and Zulpikar in green and yellow trunks. It has been a cagey start from both pugilists. Vijender with some hits in the first round but nothing substantial

2124 hrs IST: First to enter the ring is Zulpikar Maimaitiali and it is followed by Vijender Singh. “Singh is King” blares at the NSCI Stadium as the Indian boxer enters. China’s anthem first followed by the Indian anthem

Our champion Vijender Singh is here at sardar vallabhai stadium and great to see huge support him. All the best champ. #PlatinumHDCement pic.twitter.com/nQ4mCJXXNE — Souvik Paul 🇮🇳 (@iamsouvikpaul) August 5, 2017

2105 hrs IST: We’re inching towards the Vijender Singh vs Zulpikar Maimaitiali marquee match tonight. The double title bout in Mumbai. Both men with the same height, both men with near-same weight and both men are unbeaten. Couldn’t be more even than this!

2048 hrs: Judge 1: 119-109; Judge 2: 119-109 and Judge 3: 118-110. STILL THE CHAMPION, NEERAJ GOYAT! Has the flag drapped around him. Thanks the promoters and officials across seated at the NSCI Stadium and the Army School in Pune for the training and the facilities.

2046 hrs IST: The bout has gone the distance. Neither boxers have gone down or let up and they’ve both competed neck-and-neck, jab-to-jab across the 12 rounds for 36 rounds in the sweltering heat. In the end, both raise their arms in celebrations. But it will be the judges to decide who has won. Should be a tough call…

2004 hrs IST: Neeraj Goyat is now fighting Allan Tanada in the second last bout of the evening! Into the fifth round and things pretty even so far between the two boxers. The Indian boxer in black and red trunks against Tanada in the colours of his native Philippines.

1936 hrs IST: Akhil Kumar wins on his debut at the age of 36. An abdominal issue for Ty Gilchrist and that’s a technical knockout. Fantastic debut for AK47!

1910 hrs IST: The second bout of the night is a lightweight South East Asia 4 round bout b/w India’s debutant Jitender Kumar & Likhitkamporn. And Jitender makes it 2-0 in the night for India with a strong win

Bhangar Violence: Three people arrested over unrest in the city,"The accused have been booked under sections of rioting, Arms Act and Explosives Act. (File Photo) The accused have been booked under sections of rioting, Arms Act and Explosives Act. (File Photo)

Three persons were arrested on Saturday in connection with the violence in Bhangar, which continued to remain tense since January over protests against setting up of a power grid sub-station. The accused — Nazrul Mollah, Abtar Ali Mollah and Jamir Mollah — have been booked under sections of rioting, Arms Act and Explosives Act.

“There have been a few pending cases registered against the trio at Kashipur police station and hence they have been arrested,” SP (Baruipur) Arijit Sinha told The Sunday Express. Police said they are also investigating if the arrested trio have any role in the recent murder of a Trinamool leader in Bhangar, which had been simmering for over a year now over setting up of the PGCIL power grid project. The protests by locals against the sub-station had been allegedly backed by several Naxal leaders. Recently, Alik Chakraborty, a member of CPI-ML (Red Star), which had fronted the committee — Jomi, Jibika, Poribesh O Bastutantra Raksha Committee (committee to protest land, livelihood, environment and eco system) and led the protest against the sub-station, had offered a dialogue with the state government.

On January 18, two persons — Mafizul and Alamgir — had been shot dead during a violent clash between police and locals. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had claimed that Naxalite factions were instigating villagers to protest against the government. On Monday, fresh tension sparked in Bhangar after Trinamool leader Asitur Rahman alias Babusona, office bearer of Bhangar II Panchayat Samiti, was murdered. Rahman’s family had lodged a complaint against 14 Naxal leaders. Police had booked all of them. It was alleged that Rahman was attacked by members of the Jami, Jibika, Bastutantra O Paribesh O Raksha Committee. The bullet was allegedly fired by one Mirza Hasan, who is a member of the committee, and has been named in the complaint. On the other hand, the CPI-ML(Red Star) alleged that the shooting was a result of Trinamool infighting.

Police sources said that they had been monitoring all movements in and around Bhangar. “Villagers are fond of peace. They don’t want violence. There are outsiders with ulterior motives who assemble with arms and try to create unrest. So every suspected person will be sooner or later arrested,” said a police

officer.

"Bigg Boss Tamil: Tamil Nadu’s darling Oviya walks out of the show, leaves her Army heartbroken","Bigg Boss Tamil: Oviya exits the show, thanks army for incredible support. Bigg Boss Tamil: Oviya exits the show, thanks army for incredible support.

Amid speculations about her future on the popular reality show Bigg Boss Tamil, star contestant, and people’s favourite Oviya walked out of the show citing mental health issues.

In the episode aired on Saturday, after much deliberation, Oviya chose to walk out of the show as she felt she could not handle her emotions. She was seen expressing her love for a fellow contestant Aarav, and said that it wasn’t possible for her to stay away. “I think I love Arav too much… I am not able to control it. That’s why I want to go,” she was seen saying.

The Kalavani actor also said that character gap between her and the rest of inmates could not be bridged. “I got what I came here for – experiences and love. I don’t know if I will beat the show. But I have realised that true love never fails. I am happy,” she said.

The actor made the decision after a visible struggle, where she consulted a psychiatrist multiple times. Initially, she was seen telling Snehan that she was going to try to handle her feelings, she later changed her mind.

In the past, she had expressed her affection towards Aarav multiple times on the show. Aarav, who allegedly did not have an issue with Oviya’s gestures earlier had started giving her the cold-shoulder in the past week. The actual moment of Oviya’s exit was significantly devoid of emotion on her behalf. The actor hurriedly left as soon as the door opened without much dialogue, unlike the show’s previous exits.

Several housemates were in tears after she left the house. Snehan, who Oviya was close with, was inconsolable. The latest entrant Bindu, Raiza and Juliana were also in tears about her exit. Notably, Raiza and Juliana have had dramatic tiffs with Oviya earlier on the show. While Shakthi and Gayathri were sympathetic they were not as forgiving as Raiza, who was seen to be regretting her behaviour towards Oviya.

Following the show’s convention, Kamal called Oviya on the sets and had a chat with her. The young actor was welcomed with a thunderous applause, with cries of ‘Oviya, we love you’ echoing in the air. Saying that her decision to walk out of the show and its timing was right, Kamal wished her well.

“This generation accepts you with all your flaws,” said Kamal. Oviya, on the other hand, said that she feels more responsible after all the love she has received. “This love that you show me is very special. I didn’t expect this at all when I first came in,” she said. She also promised to do more for the society as a gesture for all the acceptance she has received.

When asked if she wanted to say anything to the housemates, Oviya said, “I love you Aarav” amid much protests from the audience. The episode on Saturday had multiple high notes, the most significant one being host Kamal Haasan reprimanding the channel for being indifferent and insensitive about mental illness.

The show had received much flak about setting the housemates a task that was inconsiderate to people suffering from mental illnesses. The veteran actor said he was not involved in the day-to-day activities inside the Bigg House during the weekdays. However, he added that still he felt responsible for the act and apologised to the viewers. The show had started with a warning from Kamal that he will leave the show if such insensitive tasks are found to be a part in the future.

"Mo Farah confident of 5,000m triumph at World Athletics Championship despite stitches","Mo Farah was adamant that he would be “fine” to shoot for his fifth consecutive golden 5,000/10,000m distance double at a global championship. (Source: Reuters) Mo Farah was adamant that he would be “fine” to shoot for his fifth consecutive golden 5,000/10,000m distance double at a global championship. (Source: Reuters)

Mo Farah is confident that he can win the 5,000 metres at the World Athletics Championships despite suffering cuts and bruises and needing three stitches in his left leg after his epic 10,000 metres triumph on Friday.

The 34-year-old Briton was left concerned about his left knee, which he hurt in a clash with Kenyan bronze medallist Paul Tanui during a frenetic last lap.

Yet he was adamant that he would be “fine” to shoot for his fifth consecutive golden 5,000/10,000m distance double at a global championship as he had four days of recovery time before the heats of the shorter event on Wednesday.

Asked by the BBC if he could achieve the double in his final championships as a track runner, Farah responded: “I’ve got a few scratches, I’ve got a few bruises but if I believe enough, and if I rest up enough, it’s possible. I do believe.”

The Briton says it will be his last championship track event before he concentrates on marathon running and he hopes to make it the perfect farewell next Saturday by winning a seventh world title.

Reflecting on the 10,000m, Farah reckoned he had never experienced a race as difficult as the one on Friday, when he faced the biggest test of his six-year unbeaten streak in the championships from the concerted efforts of his Kenyan, Ugandan and Ethiopian rivals.

“With 3,000 to go, I was hurting and I was tired and there was a lot of stuff going on, a lot of elbows. Physically, that race was crazy,” he said.

Ultimately, though, he would not be ruffled, winning his 10th successive global track title in world championships and Olympics with his fastest-ever championship 10,000m run, 26 minutes 49.51 seconds, the quickest in the world this year.

Sri Lanka found resistance in the second innings of the second Test against India in Colombo when Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne’s batting heroics anchored them to 209/2 at stumps after being enforced a follow-on by Virat Kohli. Earlier, in the day Sri Lanka began the proceedings from their overnight score of 50/2 but fall of wickets at regular intervals pushed them on backfoot and they were eventually bundled out for 183 in first innings.

Mendis went on to score his third Test hundred before getting out for 110 while Karunaratne remained not out on 92 on day three. Here’s what pundits and experts have to say about the day’s proceedings.

Viswanathan Anand holds Magnus Carlsen to draw in Sinquefield Cup,"The opening was a Ruy Lopez and the Graz variation was a surprise for Viswanathan Anand. (Source: File) The opening was a Ruy Lopez and the Graz variation was a surprise for Viswanathan Anand. (Source: File)

Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand played out his third draw on the trot, signing peace with reigning world champion Magnus Carlsen of

Norway in the third round of Sinquefield Cup, a part of the Grand Chess Tour.

Although he was never in any serious danger, Anand was pushed to defend an endgame. With three draws from as many games, Anand would need to post some victories if he intends to finish on the podium.

The opening was a Ruy Lopez and the Graz variation was a surprise for Anand. Carlsen has seldom employed the opening set up and Anand decided not to venture into a sharp tactical tussle.

The Norwegian equalised easily and then in his typical ways exerted pressure in the rook and minor piece endgame. Anand even lost a pawn on the 40th move but the game was always within the boundaries of a draw. The peace was signed after 66 moves.

The other matches also resulted in draws. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France had Russian Peter Svidler on the ropes but missed out on his chances, while Wesley So of United States could not force matters with his extra pawn against compatriot Hikaru Nakamura.

The other American, Fabiano Caruana, was under some pressure against Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia but then he decided not to press. In the other game of the day, Levon Aronian of Armenia and Sergey Karjakin of Russia decided to split a point a bit early.

As a result of this drawn melee, the overnight standings remained unchanged, and Carlsen, Vachier-Lagrave and Caruana continued to be ahead on two points from three games. Anand, Wesley So, Nakamura, Karjakin and Aronian share the fourth spot on 1.5 points, a half point ahead of Peter Svidler who, in turn, has a half point more than Nepomniachtchi.

With six rounds still to go in the 10-player round-robin tournament, the battle is only going to heat up from the next round when the spectators can hope for decisive games once again.

Results (Round 3): Viswanathan Anand (Ind, 1.5) drew with Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 2); Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra, 2) drew with Peter Svidler (Rus, 1); Fabiano Caruana (Usa, 2) drew with Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus, 0.5); Wesley So (Usa, 1.5) drew with Hikaru Nakamura (Usa, 1.5); Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 1.5) drew with Levon Aronian (Arm, 1.5).

(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E, File)

China on Thursday welcomed comments by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that the United States does not seek to topple the North Korean government and would like dialogue with Pyongyang at some point, saying China had always supported talks. Tillerson reiterated that Washington sought to persuade North Korea to give up its missile and nuclear weapons programmes through peaceful pressure. The United States does not seek regime change, the collapse of the regime, an accelerated reunification of the peninsula or an excuse to send the U.S. military into North Korea, Tillerson said.

Speaking to reporters, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China “attached great importance” to Tillerson’s remarks and his reiteration of what Wang called the “Four Nos” principle. “We hope the U.S. side can put this ‘Four Nos’ principle into actual policy towards North Korea,” Wang said. The United States has recently been paying more attention to security issues on the Korean peninsula, and China has always believed security is the key to resolving the problem, he added.

North Korea says it needs a strong military deterrent to prevent a hostile United States from attacking it. China hopes all sides can meet each other halfway and through talks find a way of resolving each others security concerns as this is the key for a resolution, Wang said. In a separate statement sent to Reuters regarding Tillerson’s remarks, the foreign ministry said it had always supported dialogue between the United States and North Korea.

On Saturday, Pyongyang said it had conducted another successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that proved its ability to strike the United States. Tillerson, who will also attend the ASEAN Regional Forum in Manila, is expected to press China and other regional nations to take tougher action against North Korea. China has signed up for increasingly tough United Nations sanctions against North Korea, but has also pushed for a resumption of dialogue and de-escalation by both Pyongyang and Washington.

Tillerson’s remarks showed “courage”, said the state-run Global Times newspaper, which is usually known for its nationalistic bent. “Many Americans would think Tillerson is showing weakness, but we see his statement as the most courageous expression from Washington regarding the Korean peninsula issue,” it said in an editorial on Thursday.

“While (Washington) exerts pressure on North Korea, it should leave some alternatives for Pyongyang and make it believe that abandoning its nuclear and missile programmes will do more good than insisting on this path.” Wang also urged all parties not to heighten tension on the Korean peninsula and said China had already clearly condemned North Korea’s latest missile test.

“Regarding North Korea’s recent missile launch, once again in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, China has already clearly expressed our opposition,” Wang said. “At the same time, we also call on all parties not to take any actions that will lead to an escalation in tensions.”

Manju Kumari was the lone Indian woman to have won a medal in women’s wrestling after clinching a bronze in 59kg category at the Junior World Wrestling Championship in Tampere, Finland here.

Manju registered a 2-0 victory over Ilona Prokopevniuk of Ukraine in her bronze medal play-off bout last night to finish on the podium.

En-route to her third-place finish, Manju defeated Aleksandrina Nikolaeva Kashinova of Bulgaria 5-1 in the 1/8 stage before she was outclassed 0-10 by Japan’s Yuzuru Kumano in the quarterfinals.

However, with the Japanese girl advancing to the final of 59kg, Manju got another life in the form of repechage and she did not waste the opportunity.

In her repechage bout, Manju got the better of Tianna Grace Kennett of Canada 4-0 to storm into the bronze-medal round. Today, Pooja Gehlot (women’s 55kg) and Pooja (women’s 72kg) had a chance to make it to the bronze medal play-offs of their respective weight categories but both lost their repechage bouts.

Gehlot got off to a fine start, defeating Dominika Ewa Kulwicka of Poland 12-0 and Nazira Marsbek Kyzy of Kyrgyzstan 13-3 on her way to the quarters.

However, she lost her quarterfinal bout to Lianna de la Caridad Montero Herrera of Cuba 0-10. But fortunately with the Cuban making the gold-medal round, Gehlot got another life.

But she wasted the chance as she lost her repechage bout 3-8 to Jingliang of China. Pooja also got a chance to fight in the repechage round after her pre-quarterfinals opponent Yasuha Matsuyuki of Japan reached the gold medal round.

The Japanese wrestler had beaten Pooja 10-6. However, Pooja could not capitalise on the opportunity, going down 0-4 to Hui-Tsz Chang of Chinese Taipei to lose out on a chance to fight for the third-place finish.

Pooja had earlier beaten Fanwen Shen of China 5-3 in her qualification bout. Other Indians in the fray today, Reshma Mane (63kg) and

Ankush (48kg) lost in initial rounds of their respective weight divisions to bow out of the competition.

Government plans to give voting rights to 1.36 cr farmers in APMCs,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar) Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar)

The Maharashtra government plans to give voting rights to all 1.36 crore farmers in the agricultural produce market committees (APMCs) so that they have greater say in the price mechanism. “Steps would be taken to enable all 1.36 crore farmers so that they can vote in the APMCs,” said a government source.

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has informed the state cooperation and marketing and agriculture departments that the APMCs will not be dismantled. The decision to give voting rights to the farmers is part of a reform process undertaken in the agriculture, cooperative and marketing sectors by the state government.

Currently, the Maharashtra APMC (Development and Regulation) Act, 1963, allows only gram panchayat members, co-operative societies and agriculture credit societies members to elect the APMC panels and chairpersons. There are 305 APMCs across western Maharashtra, north Maharashtra, Marathwada, Vidarbha and Konkan and most of them are controlled by the NCP.

Last year, the state government had appointed a committee to study the scope of expanding voting rights to all farmers to constitute the APMC panel. The committee report suggested that there is an overwhelming response from the farmers who have been left out of the selection process. A senior minister who did not wish to be named said: “The government can take the policy decision to give voting rights to all farmers for APMC elections.” An amendment to the legislation can follow later, he said.

Opposition leaders have questioned the move. A former NCP minister said: “Ideally, giving every farmer the right to participate sounds good. But we are not going to support it as it would become a larger poll exercise and an expensive preposition.”

A Congress leader, however, said: “The opposition to the reforms stems from the fear of losing control of the APMC, which is critical body that provides a connect with the farmers and the rural masses.”

Godhra MLA keeps party guessing ahead of Rajya Sabha polls,"Congress MLA C K Raulji, at his resident in Godhara. (Express Photo By Bhupendra Rana) Congress MLA C K Raulji, at his resident in Godhara. (Express Photo By Bhupendra Rana)

Congress MLA from Godhra C K Raulji, who did not join his party colleagues at a Bengaluru resort ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls, on Saturday said that he would first seek views of his supporters before deciding on the future course of action. Raulji, considered close to Shankershin Vaghela who quit the Congress last month, said that he will announce his decision on Monday, a day ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls in the state.

Raulji was present in Gandhinagar when Congress MLA from Thasra in Kheda district, Ramsinh Parmar, resigned from party. There are speculations that Raulji would join BJP soon after voting for the Rajya Sabha elections, but Congress leaders have rejected such suggestions. “His constituency has a good number of minority votes, and he would most certainly consider that before he decides to join the BJP,” said a top Congress leader.

Raulji began his career from Janta Dal in the early nineties and joined Vaghela when the latter floated the Rashtriya Janta Party (RJP) in 1995. Raulji joined the Congress after the RJP-Congress merger. He was elected from Godhra Assembly seat in 2012.

Five books to look forward to in August 2017,"Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon) Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon)

Another month has gone by and a fresh set of books is ready to hit the nearest stands. With an intriguing mix of genres — dominated by non-fiction — August offers simple reading options without the hype that distracts and manipulates readers.

There are no big literary names, no grand book launches for the upcoming books in the coming month. Readers, thus, will have an opportunity to pick titles on the basis of merit and not on the credentials of their authors.

For those looking to focus on more trending issues, we have a couple of political biographies releasing — and, yes, one is on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi. More literary readers may look forward to two anthologies of late writer Khushwant Singh. The list also has a revised biography of Agatha Christie, whose thrillers have once again created a buzz on social media after HarperCollins India released 25 limited facsimile editions of the best books from the Queen of Crime. There are several books focussing on economy and business from Hachette India.

But here are the five books that we can’t wait to read this August:

* The Generation of Rage in Kashmir by David Devadas (Oxford University Press)

This book by a former editor at Business Standard describes the livid experience of Kashmiris who came of age between 2007 and 2017. It shows that Kashmiris generally had high hopes for peace and stability when the militancy, which began in 1988, seemed to be tapering off around 2006 — but alas, that was not to be. It explores the reasons why there was so much angst and rage, which exploded in agitations and stone-pelting in 2008, 2010, and 2016 and why a new militancy is on the rise. The book also traces the decline of hope among the Kashmiris as the situation worsened from a perceived threat to their identity in 2008 to rage over the killing of innocents in 2010. The anger, the author argues, has finally resulted in support for militancy in 2016.

* The Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told by Muhammad Umar Memon (Aleph)

Selected and translated by writer, editor and translator par excellence Muhammad Umar Memon, the 25 stories in this book represent the finest short fiction in Urdu literature. Every story in the anthology illustrates one or the other facet of the form in the Urdu literary tradition. But even more than for their formal technique and inventiveness, these stories have been included because of their power and impact on the reader. Despairing, violent, passionate, humorous, ironic and profound — the fiction in “The Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told” will imprint itself indelibly on your mind.

* Politicshock by Meghnad Desai (Rupa)

In this perceptive account, Meghnad Desai, a Labour Peer in the House of Lords, opens up the debate beyond the West and looks at parallels between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump as two outsiders who broke through the barriers to reach the top. He analyses Asia’s challenge to Western hegemony and asks if the conventional wisdom about the hegemony of free trade liberalism needs re-examination. He peers into the future to look at the greatest challenge facing the world today: Will the Liberal Order survive, collapse or mutate? Is the world at a cusp? Is history — the old saga of blood, sweat and tears — about to resume its course?

* The Epic City: The World on the Streets of Calcutta by Kushanava Choudhury (Bloomsbury)

(Source: Amazon) (Source: Amazon)

A masterful and entirely fresh portrait of great hopes and dashed dreams from a major new literary voice. “Everything that could possibly be wrong with a city was wrong with Calcutta” — and yet, after completing his education in the US, Choudhury embodied his parents’ greatest fears by returning to the city they escaped for a better life. Sifting through the chaos and decay for the stories that are ignored by the papers, that don’t fall into any reporter’s beat, “The Epic City” is a soulful, insightful and meticulously researched account of everyday lives and an extraordinary portrait of a city which is a world unto itself.

* India: Priorities for the Future by Bimal Jalan (Penguin)

(Source: Amazon) (Source: Amazon)

Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Bimal Jalan’s formidable analysis of the last four decades of India’s economic journey illuminates the nation’s transition from a strictly regulated, slow-growth state enterprise to one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Drawing on this vast experience, he compares two distinct periods — 1980-2000 and 2000-15 — to examine the core changes and their significance, and considers their lessons for the immediate future.

Kremlin agrees with Donald Trump that bilateral ties “at very dangerous low”,"U.S. President Donald Trump (AP) U.S. President Donald Trump (AP)

The Kremlin said on Friday it fully agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump who said in a Twitter message that Washington’s “relationship with Russia is at an all-time and very dangerous low”.

Trump’s comments posted on Thursday came one day after he grudgingly signed new sanctions against Russia into law, a move Moscow said amounted to a full-scale trade war and an end to hopes for better ties with the Trump administration.

“We fully share this opinion,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters when asked about Trump’s Twitter message. “The danger may lie in a deficit of interaction and cooperation in those matters which are vitally important for our two countries and peoples.”

Two Islamic State men facing terrorism charges in Australia were plotting to carry out the country’s most sophisticated terror attack on an Etihad Airways flight departing from Sydney last month, police said today. The raids carried by police at five properties in Sydney suburbs had led to arrest of four men.

Khaled Khayat and Mahmoud Khayat have both been charged with two terrorism-related offences and were refused bail in Parramatta Local Court today. Another man was released mid-week, while a fourth man remains in custody.

The improvised explosive device was intended to be smuggled on a flight on July 15, but the plan was aborted before it reached airport security.

Two men were arrested on the charges of planning a terror attack.

Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said Khaled Khayat and Mahmoud Khayat, charged last night with terror offences, had been planning “one of the most sophisticated terror plots attempted on Australian soil”.

Police will allege the IED had been built under instructions from a senior Islamic State (IS) controller in Syria and was to be planted in the luggage of a brother of one of the accused on the Etihad flight out of Sydney on July 15, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.

Police said the brother was unaware of the plot.

Police described the IED as a “high-end military-grade explosive”.

However, that attempt was aborted and a second plan was then hatched to create a “chemical dispersion device”.

Phelan said components and precursor chemicals of the hydrogen sulphide bomb were located during searches on properties in Sydney over the last few days but the plot had now been “completely disrupted”.

“Not only have we stopped the IED that was believed to go on the plane but we have also completely disrupted the intended chemical dispersion device,” he said.

“We do believe that through the wonderful efforts not only of law enforcement but in particular our intelligence agencies that we have completely disrupted this plot.”

German police set to arrive in Kolkata for investigation into cases related to fraudery with German nationals,"Officials from the German Police and the country’s public prosecutor office are set to arrive in connection to the probe. (Representational Image) Officials from the German Police and the country’s public prosecutor office are set to arrive in connection to the probe. (Representational Image)

Days after the CID Cyber Cell arrested five persons, including a woman, for allegedly duping German nationals staying in New Town, officials from the German Police and the country’s public prosecutor office are set to arrive here in connection to the probe. On June 7, Richa Pipulwa, Vikramjeet Pandher, Akash Singh, Nilesh Rastogi and Subhrajit Pal were arrested for allegedly cheating several people from Germany, Sweden, Indonesia and Canada through a call centre at Webel IT Park in New Town.

Sources said the racket was busted after the CID Cyber Cell received a letter from the German Police, alleging that several German citizens have become victims of such a racket. “The CID Cyber Cell had contacted the German authorities. German Public Prosecutor Juergen Lewandowski will arrive in Kolkata on Monday. He is set to present the case in court, and seek permission to interrogate the accused,” a senior CID official said. He will be accompanied by police officer Alexander Sirowi of Landerskriminalamt — the State Criminal Police Office in Germany.

Sources in CID said the miscreants used to call the victims, introduce themselves as members of Microsoft’s customer care support and offer to upgrade their computer systems. They used to demand huge amounts for the service. “Misappropriated money had come from the bank accounts of German nationals Heidrun Bohmer, Dennis Kremer and Frads Dahlgaard. Following this, the CID Cyber Cell requested the German authorities to trace the victims. In response, the German public prosecutor’s office recently replied that they have traced the victims. Heidrun had filed a complaint in Germany,” said a CID official.

US informs UN its intention to withdraw from Paris deal,"President Donald Trump. President Donald Trump.

The US has submitted its formal communication to the UN indicating it will withdraw from the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement as soon as possible, the State Department has said. The communication is in line with the decision announced by President Donald Trump recently, which was one of his key electoral promises. But according to the terms of the pact, the US can’t fully withdraw until November 4, 2020, which would be a day after the next presidential election is held in the US. This means the next US president could still rejoin the agreement.

The Paris climate deal aims to prevent the Earth from heating up by 2C since the start of the industrial age. The State Department said that the US submitted a communication to the UN, in its capacity as a depositary for the Paris agreement, regarding the US intent to withdraw from it as soon as it is eligible to do so. As the president indicated in his June 1 announcement and subsequently, he is open to re-engaging with the agreement if the US can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its businesses, its workers, its people, and its taxpayers, it said in a statement.

The US supports a balanced approach to climate policy that lowers emissions while promoting economic growth and ensuring energy security, it said. “We will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through innovation and technology breakthroughs, and work with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and deploy renewable and other clean energy sources, given the importance of energy access and security in many nationally determined contributions,” the state department said.

However, the US will continue to participate in international climate change negotiations and meetings, including the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP-23) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to protect US interests and ensure all future policy options remain open to the administration, it said.

“Such participation will include ongoing negotiations related to guidance for implementing the Paris agreement,” it added.

Not a Nice Woman to Know: Author LS Hilton on the struggle to keep her protagonist unlikeable,"Hilton will admit to one failing on her part: she hadn’t realised that Judith was a “textbook sociopath” in the first book. Hilton will admit to one failing on her part: she hadn’t realised that Judith was a “textbook sociopath” in the first book.

LS Hilton does not mind one bit if you didn’t like her books. “I’m quite happy to talk to people who don’t like my books. If there’s one thing I’d hate, it is for people to think that my work is ‘nice’,” says Hilton, author of the two best-selling erotic thrillers of the past two years, Maestra and its sequel, Domina. Although sales of the books in India are moving slowly, Hilton’s books have sold a million copies worldwide; and the film rights of Maestra were snapped up even before the book was published in March 2016. “The questions I loathe to answer if whether or not the protagonist, Judith Rashleigh, is a feminist and whether my books are feminist or not. I didn’t task myself with writing a feminist novel, I wanted to write about an interesting woman,” says Hilton, when we meet at a bookstore in Mumbai.

In Maestra, Hilton introduces us to Judith, a young, attractive woman who loses her job in a low-paying position at a British auction house. An unlikeable character, and a not-entirely reliable narrator, Judith embarks on a path that takes her deep into the world of the European art elite, millionaires, playboys and playgirls, and murder. Judith isn’t the one solving them — she’s committing them.

“If I’ve created a character that people feel ambiguous about, I will take that as a compliment. Women have come up to me and said that Judith uses her body as a means to an end — that’s not a feminist thing to do. But is it not real? Does the world not place value on beautiful women? So why shouldn’t she use both her body and her intelligence, if she can?” says the 40-something Hilton, who is enjoying her time out in the sun as LS Hilton — and not Lisa Hilton, prolific writer of British historical fiction and historical biographies of monarchs such Elizabeth I. “Judith and I have an academic background in common — we both studied English at Oxford, art history in France and Italy, and interned at auction houses. If there is one thing that Judith loves the most in the world, it is art,” says Hilton.

In both Maestra as well as Domina, Hilton introduces other artists, charting their lives and work, almost creating a shadow biography, while Judith plans her next move, and her next victim. In Maestra, she writes about Artemisia Gentileschi, the 17th century Italian Baroque painter who was raped by her tutor and his friend, and who fought a legal battle for justice; in Domina, the great Caravaggio accompanies Judith while she is on the run, just like he had been after murdering a man during a brawl in 1606. “Judith is very aware of her outsider status; Gentileschi and Caravaggio were outsiders too. I wanted to put that kind of art in the book because I think their work will always be exciting and relevant,” says Hilton, who introduces Paul Gauguin, the French post-Impressionist artist, in the last instalment of the trilogy, to be published next year.

And to think that years ago, the trilogy was only half a manuscript, locked in a drawer, forgotten for a while. “My agent at the time had suggested I write something erotic, and I did. But she didn’t like the manuscript, so I put it away in a drawer. About two years ago, I read it and combined it with another novel I had put aside,” says Hilton. The finished manuscript was sent to every major publishing house, but no offers were forthcoming. Hilton debated on publishing it herself, when a friend of hers borrowed it to read. “She runs a well-known restaurant in London and Mark Smith, the CEO of Bonnier Publishing, frequents it. After she read it, she plonked it on his table when he came to eat there, and asked him to have a look. The next day, when she came to open the shop, he was standing there, wanting to know who had written it,” says Hilton. In a matter of weeks, the manuscript was sold for seven figures to Amy Pascal, most recently the producer of Spiderman: Homecoming, and the screenplay will be written by Erin Cressida Wilsons, who adapted Paula Hawkins’s bestseller, The Girl on the Train, for the big screen.

Hilton will admit to one failing on her part: she hadn’t realised that Judith was a “textbook sociopath” in the first book. “I had given her things like a high libido, low-risk capacity, adrenaline, without realising that this was a template for sociopathic behaviour. In the second book, there’s a back story that some readers might see as a justification for her behaviour. To them I say, please have some faith in me as a technician,” says Hilton, adding, “I’m in a constant battle with my American publishers who want me to make her nicer, to make readers feel sympathy for her. But she’s not nice and she will never be, and she won’t end nicely either.”

Pakistan’s new PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi forms cabinet with an eye to 2018 poll,"Pakistan’s former Petroleum Minister and Prime Minister designate Shahid Khaqan Abbasi arrives to attend the National Assembly session in Islamabad, Pakistan August 1, 2017. REUTERS Pakistan’s former Petroleum Minister and Prime Minister designate Shahid Khaqan Abbasi arrives to attend the National Assembly session in Islamabad, Pakistan August 1, 2017. REUTERS

Pakistan’s new Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Friday formed a cabinet filled with allies of toppled leader Nawaz Sharif, in a reshuffle that appears aimed at bolstering support ahead of general elections due in mid-2018. Ishaq Dar, a powerful finance minister, returns in the same role, despite a criminal investigation ordered against him by the Supreme Court. Another staunch Sharif ally, Khawaja Asif, is to be Foreign Minister after having simultaneously run the ministries of defence and power. The cabinet has almost doubled in size to 47 members, sworn in during a televised ceremony after a reading from the Koran holy book in the mainly Muslim nation of 190 million people.

“It’s a massive cabinet,” said Pakistani writer and analyst Zahid Hussain. “It shows that it’s all about the next election.” But no decision appears to have yet been made by the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party over whether Abbasi will stay as premier or step down after a brief period to make way for Sharif’s brother Shahbaz, as outlined previously.

Nawaz Sharif resigned last week after the Supreme Court disqualified him for not declaring a source of income he denies receiving. But he retains control of PML-N and put forward Abbasi as temporary prime minister until Shahbaz becomes eligible to take over by winning a parliamentary by-election. Since Abbasi’s election, however, the party leadership no longer seems sure about that plan, as some fear Shahbaz’s departure from his position as chief minister of eastern Punjab state could weaken the party’s grip on a core base of voters.

Pakistan’s mix of political parties means that whoever wins Punjab, which is home to more than half the country’s population, is likely to form the next government. Former petroleum minister Abbasi, the co-founder of a budget airline, has vowed to run an efficient government but has indicated major decisions will flow from Nawaz, cementing the view of the toppled leader as the power behind the throne.

Abbasi is a staunch Nawaz ally, having been by his side for most of his political career. The cabinet was formed after several discussions between them, and Nawaz’s allies.

There are 28 federal ministers and 19 state ministers in the new cabinet, almost double Sharif’s 25-strong cabinet when he swept the 2013 polls. Abbasi will also head a new energy ministry that merges the petroleum and power portfolios. Ahsan Iqbal, head of a commission tasked with building the Beijing-funded $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic corridor, has been appointed Interior Minister. The opposition has criticised the PML-N’s focus on large infrastructure projects as vote-focused measures that saddle Pakistan with debt, at the expense of schools and hospitals.

“If they carry on with Nawaz Sharif’s policies, the country will go deeper into debt,” said Naeem Ul Haq, of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party.

FEUDAL POLITICS

To shore up the voter base in Punjab, Abbasi has added five politicians from prominent families that command huge vote banks in the south of the region, seen as pivotal to the next poll.

A feudal structure in much of rural Pakistan allows powerful families to wield huge influence and command voter allegiances, often easily switched in a nation where political parties are driven more by powerful figureheads than ideology.

The inclusion of five politicians from south Punjab aimed to nail down their loyalties ahead of the 2018 contest, analyst Hussain said. “There was always been a fear or a concern they would jump ship if the government seems weak,” he added.

Under Sharif, the PML-N has also courted the minority vote, using symbolic gestures at odds with its conservative base.

US test-launches unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile,"An unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile launches during an operational test at 2:10 am Pacific Daylight Time Wednesday.

The US Air Force successfully launched an unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile from California, the fourth such test this year. The 30th Space Wing says the Minuteman 3 missile launched at 2:10 am Wednesday from Vandenberg Air Force Base, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles.

An Air Force statement said the test would show the effectiveness, readiness, and accuracy of the weapon system. Minuteman missiles are regularly tested with launches from Vandenberg that send unarmed re-entry vehicles 4,200 miles (6,800 kilometers) across the Pacific to a target area at Kwajalein Atoll.

However, the latest US launches come amid tensions with North Korea as that nation develops its own ICBMs. Flight data on North Korea’s most recent test, conducted Friday, showed that a broad part of the mainland United States, including Los Angeles and Chicago, is now in range of Pyongyang’s weapons, according to analysts.

In response, the US Air Force flew two B-1 bombers over the Korean Peninsula on Sunday in a show of force. The US also said it conducted a successful test of a missile defense system located in Alaska.

Previous Minuteman ICBM launches this year were conducted in February, April and May. That month, the Air Force also conducted a test of a missile interceptor launched from Vandenberg. The interceptor destroyed a mock warhead over the Pacific.

Pro Kabaddi 2017: Relive the Hyderabad leg of PKL Season 5 in eight pictures,"The fifth season of Pro Kabaddi got under way on August 28 and the first leg at Hyderabad came to an end on Thursday. Telugu Titans had another go at Patna Pirates in the final game at the Gachibowli stadium and suffered a 36-43 defeat. This is also their worst start in the history of Pro Kabaddi, where the Titans have lost five games on the trot and two against Pirates in a single season. When they won their opening match against league newcomers Tamil Thalaivas, it looked like the Titans may have a smooth ride at home. The reality, though, was that the first day was the only good outing in what has been a horrendous week so far at Hyderabad for the hosts. They were playing a match everyday save for the one-day break and the Titans collapsed under the punishing schedule.

Match of the week: Gujarat Fortunegiants 27-27 Haryana Steelers: It was a story of two teams who were just not ready to give up. On Wednesday, the Fortunegiants and Steelers gave the Gachibowli crowd a match to savour. There were minutes that belonged completely to Gujarat, only to be followed by those dominated by Haryana. The latter even came back from a 20-13 deficit to level the match 23-23. After that, they went blow for blow and shared the spoils in the end.

Raid of the week: Pardeep Narwal’s Super Raid vs Telugu Titans : The fourth match of the week between Telugu Titans and Patna Pirates can be given a ‘Before and After’ division with Pardeep Narwal’s Super Raid being the dividing line. With just a few minutes left on the clock, the Titans had a two-point lead, the stadium was absolutely rocking and Rahul Chaudhari was just a point away from becoming the first to touch 500 raid points. Enter Pardeep ‘Dupki King’ Narwal. The Titans went for the tackle; Narwal jumped over one defender, rolled another over and treated the third to his dupki before getting back into his half – a good day’s work. The Pirates went into the lead. As it turned out, Narwal had defeated the Titans mentally with that piece of skill as his team went on to win 35-29.

Star Watch: Anup Kumar showed that he truly is Captain Cool with the way he handled that first defeat U-Mumba suffered. Meraj Sheykh was stellar in Dabang Delhi’s first match against Jaipur Pink Panthers while the opposition captain Manjeet Chillar cut a frustrated figure.

Star Watch: Nitin Tomar did not seem to be budged at all by the ‘Most expensive player of the league’ tag, helping his UP Yodha in both the defensive and raiding departments.

Surprise element: Sachin Kumar (Gujarat Fortunegiants): Gujarat Fortunegiants are a team of youngsters. Their captain Sukesh Hegde played second fiddle to Rahul Chaudhari until last season. They have had a good start this time, winning their first match and drawing their second. 18-year-old Sachin Kumar has been a revelation in these two matches. He has got them raid points at crucial moments. The youngster goes into the opposition half and dashes around making defenders jump and hop all around him and then runs back dangerously close to the lobby line. Judging from what was on display in Hyderabad, his gung-ho style of raiding attitude is something that one can expect Gujarat to benefit from this season.

Rahul Chaudhari became the first player to score 500 raid points in the history of Pro Kabaddi. He was also the first player to cross 500 points tally during the fourth season of the league."
"‘Poets are self-motivated souls, poetry is compulsion’: Kiriti Sengupta","“You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words”, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) “You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words”, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)

Of all romanticism associated with poetry, the ethereal and carefree life of a poet is perhaps the most adored. But is this — the state of a poet’s being — the reason for the existence of poetry, and, more so, what is a poem’s purpose?

There are no wars to be won through poetry, no great intentions behind a poem’s composition and it is more of a compulsion for self-motivated souls than a mere hobby, says Kiriti Sengupta, a gifted Indian poet, who has more than 17 books of poetry to his credit.

“I think writing poetry cannot be defined as a favourite pastime for a writer. An honest poet writes poetry out of sheer compulsion. Poets write poetry when they think it will do justice to their thoughts or expressions. There are several other ways for conveying messages, observations,and experiences, but poetry is written only when poets think they can do no better without indulging in this genre of literature,” Sengupta told IANS in an interview.

Elaborating, the much-acclaimed poet from West Bengal said that he had no “great intention” when he started composing poetry and even now he does not entertain ideas of “changing the society” through his poems. “Poetry does not change anything. It does not initiate a change either. Poetry makes you think, makes you aware, and it makes you revisit your concerns, which may include your agonies as well,” he added.

Sengupta’s “My Glass of Wine” is almost autobiographical and is now a part of India’s first poetry trilogy, “Dreams of the Sacred and Ephemeral”, which also bears two other works, “The Reverse Tree” and “Healing Waters Floating Lamps”. In the first two collections, one finds verses placed alongside prose. Sengupta stressed on the fact that he wanted to eliminate the apathy of a common reader towards poetry and thus a mix of prose and poetry was the immediate option.

But poetry is considered to be one of the finest expressions of literature and, even today, it is widely read and adored. How fulfilling is the experience of a poet then?

“You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words. Whatever be your objective, if you do it well, you are happy at the end of the day. Prose writing is generally more time-consuming, but then, there are poems that, no matter if they are long or short, take days and even weeks to write and finish,” quipped the poet.

And then there is the writer’s bloc. Like all creative people, a poet is no stranger to this rather depressing phenomenon, but Sengupta says that one has to live with it as it is a part of the journey.

“I’ve my share of non-productive days when I fail to write. After publishing more than 17 books I don’t find it stressful or alarming any more. I just feel bad about it, but it is only when I read other poets’ work. See, it is extremely important to keep abreast of the latest happenings in the field of poetry, especially when someone is seriously engaged in it,” he maintained.

Sengupta also contested the idea that poetry has taken a backseat in recent years and said that the reality is actually contrary to popular belief. There has been a rise in poetry consciousness across India, he said, and we have more than one organisation in every city promoting poetry among new readers, especially youngsters. It is, however, debatable whether they promote quality work and enhance the availability of quality work.

He also emphasised that it is indeed impossible “to earn a living from writing poetry” in India. “Poets are self-motivated souls who write poems for the joy derived from creating a work of art,” said the poet, whose upcoming chapbook of verses is titled “Solitary Stillness” and is due to be published in August.

China defends gasfield activity in East China Sea,"Representational Image/ Reuters Representational Image/ Reuters

China on Wednesday defended its oil and gas activity in the East China Sea as occurring in areas “indisputably” under its jurisdiction, after Japanese protests stirred a longstanding dispute over the region. The two countries both claim islands in the East China Sea controlled by Japan, which knows them as Senkaku, and regularly send ships to nearby waters to assert their claims amid repeated diplomatic clashes.

Talks between Tokyo and Beijing begun in June 2008 to cooperate over oil and gas resources in the area broke down two years later amid rising tensions, and have not resumed. Yesterday, Japan’s top government spokesperson Yoshihide Suga told reporters it was “extremely regrettable that China is unilaterally continuing its development activity” by stopping mobile drilling ships near the median line separating the two countries’ exclusive economic zones (EEZ).

He added that Japan lodged a protest late last month after noticing the activity but did not specify what exactly the Chinese ships were doing. “China’s oil and gas activities in the East China Sea are all located in maritime areas indisputably under Chinese jurisdiction,” China’s foreign ministry told AFP in a statement, adding: “The so-called issue of ‘unilateral exploitation’ does not exist.”

The gas field under the joint development agreement lies in an area where both countries’ EEZs overlap. Japan says the median line between the two nations should mark the limits of their respective EEZs.

But China insists the border should be drawn closer to Japan, taking into account the continental shelf and other features of the ocean. China’s foreign ministry said it rejected the idea of a median line between Japan and China, calling it “Japan’s unilateral proposition.”

Chinese drilling ships were last spotted near that line in October 2016, Kyodo News and the Sankei Shimbun daily reported. So far, China has built 16 drilling platforms on its side near the median line, the Asahi Shimbun reported.

Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump offered reassurances the US would come to Japan’s defence if China were to seize the uninhabited Senkaku islets, which it calls Diaoyu. In a joint statement with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in February, the pair said they “oppose any unilateral action that seeks to undermine Japan’s administration of these islands”.

Study says tailored suicide prevention messages work best,"Suicide prevention messages could be more effective. (Representational Photo) Suicide prevention messages could be more effective. (Representational Photo)

A researcher at US Oregon State University (OSU) has found that if tailored to specific target groups, suicide prevention messages could be more effective. Elizabeth Marino, assistant professor of Anthropology at OSU Cascades, has worked with her colleagues for two years on a project to identify what kind of messages are more receptive, reports Xinhua news agency.

Their findings, published on Monday in Archives of Suicide Research, address the reality that more than half of the roughly 40,000 people in the US who commit suicide every year do so with a gun, and that only 5 per cent of them survive. To avoid identity politics, Marino’s suggestion is to pay attention to cultural factors in public health messaging.

Marino said that to be effective, public messaging should not be culturally neutral. “Information by itself isn’t changing minds at all,” Marino said, adding “But if the language in the message is sensitive and respects culturally specific values, then people are more open to the information and will maybe change their decisions.”

Acknowledging that the study alone may not change the status quo, as people in the US are politically and culturally divisive, Marino expects that more research of the kind could impact changes.

“It’s especially worth noting that there are in fact joint goals that people with diverse perspectives can talk about and reach consensus on as long as we understand each person’s cultural framework.”

Need to be prepared Test debut: Mitchell Swepson,"Mitchell Swepson has been included in Australia’s squad for their tour of Bangladesh. Mitchell Swepson has been included in Australia’s squad for their tour of Bangladesh.

Leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson was on Saturday included in the 14-member squad for Australia’s tour of Bangladesh where they are scheduled to play a tour game and two Test matches. The leggie while talking to cricket.com.au told about his plans and preparation for this upcoming tour.

“Obviously I’m the last one added to the squad so I’d think that the other two spinners are most likely to get a go ahead of me,” Swepson told.

“But you never know what can happen and what the pitches are going to be like. It’s all up to the selection panel and the skipper and the coach in which way they want to go. “I’ve got to go over there prepared to play a Test match. Whether that happens or not is another thing. “If it doesn’t happen, I’ll just be a sponge and soak it all up and take that experience away with me,” added the leggie.

Talking about the call up, the leg-spinner said that he was pretty confident about the way he has been performing in the start of pre-season.

“I’m confident that with the work I’ve done at the end of last season and the start of this pre-season, if I was to get the call-up, even though it’s been a long-time, I’d be ready to go,” he said.

Swepson had a chat with Shane Warne in the Unplayable Podcast after which he revealed that Warne can talk about leg-spin all day.

“I didn’t get much of a word in, he could talk all day about leg-spin bowling,” Swepson said of the 15-minute chat with Warne.

“He gave me a few tips on my action, but it was more about the mentality of bowling, body language and things like that. “And I asked him a couple of questions about bowling at home and he was really good. He gave up a lot of advice so it was really good to finally chat to him,” he added.

Swepson later told that he thanked Warne for his inputs afterwards.

“I thanked him very much for (his support), but I didn’t get a chance to have a beer with him,” Swepson said.

Australia squad: Steve Smith (c), David Warner (vc), Ashton Agar, Jackson Bird, Hilton Cartwright, Pat Cummins, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Renshaw, Mitch Swepson, Matthew Wade.

"My Khel Ratna recommendation will inspire other paralympian athletes, says Devendra Jhajharia","Devendra Jhajharia said that he deserved this award 12 years back when he created the first record. (Source: File) Devendra Jhajharia said that he deserved this award 12 years back when he created the first record. (Source: File)

After becoming the first paralympian to be recommended for Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, Devendra Jhajharia on Saturday said that other paralympian athletes will be inspired to dream big.

“I am really delighted to be recommended for this award and I am hopeful that the other athletes would take inspiration from this and perform their best and aim for big,” Jhajaria said, speaking to reporters.

Speaking ahead of the ‘Kranti Daud’, organised by NGO Aapan Sare, Jhajharia thanked his mother who gave him support and helped him at every stage of his career and encouraged him to make his career in sports.

“The country aimed for gold in Olympics and I am privileged and lucky to get two gold in the events,” Rajasthan-born para-athlete said. He also said that the Maharashtra government should improve the facilities for all the paralympians.

“They can provide better facilities for the sportsmen. Compared to other countries the facilities in India were not up to the mark,” he said.

Jhajharia also feels that there should be awareness among youths in school regarding the bad effects of doping and they should be educated on this topic.

He also said that he deserved this award 12 years back when he created the first record. President of the NGO, Balkrishna Purnekar said, “around

12,000 students are likely to participate in the events in eight groups and the total prize money is Rs. 2.50 lakh.”

ATK sign former Tottenham Hotspur striker Robbie Keane,"Robbie Keane joined the LA Galaxy from Tottenham in 2011. (Source: AP File) Robbie Keane joined the LA Galaxy from Tottenham in 2011. (Source: AP File)

ATK brought in former Tottenham Hotspur and Los Angeles Galaxy striker Robbie Keane as their first signing after disassociating with Spanish club Atletico de Madrid as minority stakeholders. The Republic of Ireland will bring in a wealth of experience to the side who are looking to win their third title in four Indian Super League (ISL) seasons when the season gets underway in November.

Speaking about the move, Keane was done in by the appeal of playing in Asia and in the cash-rich ISL. “I feel extremely fortunate to have played for some of the best clubs in England and the USA, as well as representing my country at several major tournaments. At this stage of my career, the offer to experience a new league and culture in Asia appealed to me. To join the current Indian Super League champions is a great pleasure and through hardwork I hope to bring the ATK fans more success and enjoyment over the course of the 2017/2018 season,” he said in a statement.

Keane is the first of five foreign players allowed for an ISL side. His inclusion into the squad would come as a big boost to Teddy Sheringham – the club’s manager – who was a prolific striker in his day at the London club too. “His enthralling skills with the ball and willingness to take on the opposition without inhibition is an asset for any team. I am sure ATK’s striking abilities will be bolstered with Robbie in the side. I am sure the young Indian players we have selected from the domestic draft will learn from him about the way he goes about preparing for a major tournament like ISL,” said Sheringham.

Keane last played for Aston Villa in England’s Championship as a loan player from LA Galaxy.

"With military discipline imposed, Trump getting more time for decisions","US President Donald Trump speaks to journalists after John Kelly was sworn in as White House Chief of Staff in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, US, July 31, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts US President Donald Trump speaks to journalists after John Kelly was sworn in as White House Chief of Staff in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, US, July 31, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

Donald Trump’s choice of a general as chief of staff has quickly brought more order to the White House and is giving the president more time to ponder decisions as he tries to bounce back from a rocky six months with no major legislative achievements. But John Kelly, a retired four-star Marine Corps general with an intimidating air, still has many challenges to confront to stem the chaos that has raged at the White House since Trump took office in January, not least the Republican president’s free-wheeling style.

Trump, who attended a military prep school growing up, is said to be pleased at the increased discipline that Kelly has brought in since taking over from Reince Priebus, who struggled to maintain order and was often ignored by senior staff. “He is feeling like he’s getting more time to read the materials and have substantive discussions and talk about the decisions he’s making,” said a White House official, who asked not to be identified.

“Before, he was carrying a lot himself. It feels now like there is more burden-sharing around. He has more trust and confidence in Kelly,” the official said. Aides said Kelly, who previously was running the Department of Homeland Security and who began work on Monday, was commanding respect in the West Wing.

“Kelly is scary in a way that Reince wasn’t,” said an administration official. Senior staff meetings are well attended and no longer considered optional as they were under Priebus. Typically anyone who goes into the Oval Office to see Trump makes sure Kelly knows.

“I think you’ve seen less backbiting,” said Ken Duberstein, who was a chief of staff for 1980s President Ronald Reagan. “I think the idea that he is asserting, that the White House cannot be a free-wheeling place but rather there is a chain of command and things go in an orderly process, are all major steps in the right direction.” So far, Kelly has not managed to put a stop to leaks to the media that have infuriated Trump.

On Thursday, the Washington Post published transcripts of Trump’s sometimes fraught calls in the early days of his presidency with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. He has not reined in the president himself, and it is by no means clear he will try to do so.

Confidants say Trump is still speed-dialing people in the evenings, as he has done for decades. He is still firing off bombastic tweets, like one on Thursday blaming the Republican-controlled Congress for what he called an all-time low in relations with Russia because it piled on more sanctions. But Trump did stay on message at a rally in West Virginia on Thursday night, reading from a Teleprompter and sticking to the script.

Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser, said time will tell whether Kelly can reform any of the habits Trump has displayed during the first six months in office. “He’ll have some of the smartest people around him and they’re not there to change him but to make him better. Even Tom Brady needs a coach,” said Bennett, referring to the highly successful New England Patriots quarterback.

NO BABYSITTING

Trump’s friends said there is value to letting Trump be Trump, particularly since Priebus’ attempt to shape Trump into a more traditional president failed spectacularly. “Kelly can go too far in the other direction. Donald Trump doesn’t need a babysitter. He’s his own man,” said one friend. “I understand the attitude of the military types that if they can control all information flow they can control the president. But the first time he learns something that he should have heard from staff, there will be hell to pay.”

Trump has yet to notch up a major legislative win and Kelly has scant experience with lawmakers. In the mid-1990s he served as the Marine Corps commandant’s liaison officer to the U.S. House of Representatives. So far his appointment is being welcomed on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers had grown weary of the chaos at the White House.

Many were heartened to see one of Kelly’s first acts was to jettison Anthony Scaramucci as communications director after a foul-mouthed tirade against Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon. “He is going to bring such an air of calm,” said Senator David Perdue, a Republican and early supporter of Trump’s election campaign. “This man has been through a career of providing results, and showing leadership.”

Kelly is seen as likely to form a partnership with two other retired generals in Trump’s inner circle, Defense Secretary James Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster. The three attended a meeting of top national security aides on Thursday in the White House Situation Room aimed at settling on a strategy for Afghanistan that Trump, who tends to be non-interventionist, will find acceptable.

Whether they will be able to overcome his doubts about sending around 4,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan is unclear. “I think he likes the snap and efficiency. But I seriously question whether any of them share his non-interventionist world view,” the friend said.

Rwanda leader Paul Kagame wins 3rd term in vote he called ‘a formality’,"Rwandan President Paul Kagame of the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) waves to his supporters during his final campaign rally in Kigali, Rwanda August 2, 2017. (REUTERS) Rwandan President Paul Kagame of the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) waves to his supporters during his final campaign rally in Kigali, Rwanda August 2, 2017. (REUTERS)

Rwanda’s longtime President Paul Kagame has easily won a third term in office in what he had called “a formality.” He faces another seven years leading the small East African nation praised for its economic performance but criticized for its silencing of opponents.

Electoral authorities overnight said Kagame had won more than 98 percent of the vote with 80 percent of the votes counted, with no major change expected when final results are announced later Saturday. He had faced two challengers. Kagame addressed jubilant supporters at party headquarters and urged Rwandans, including those who hadn’t supported him, to work together. “This election was criticized so much due to me continuing to be your leader, especially people from outside the country because they oppose the will of Rwandans,” the president told supporters. “But Rwandans have shown that it was not manipulated by anyone but their own will.”

Kagame has led the country of 12 million people since his rebels helped to end its genocide in 1994 in which more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred by Hutu extremists.The 59-year-old president has been praised for the country’s economic growth, but human rights groups accuse his government of using state powers to silence any opposition. Rwandan authorities, including the president, deny it.A constitutional amendment in 2015 allows Kagame to stay in power until 2034 if he pursues it.

Kagame was running against Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda _ the only permitted opposition party _ and independent candidate and former journalist Philippe Mpayimana. Three potential candidates were disqualified for allegedly failing to fulfil requirements including collecting enough signatures. With 80 percent of the votes counted, Mpayimana had received just 0.72 percent and conceded defeat and congratulated Kagame. Habineza received 0.45 percent.

More than 80 percent of Rwanda’s 6.9 million registered voters cast their ballots, according to Charles Munyaneza, executive secretary of the Rwanda Electoral Commission. In Rwanda’s tidy capital, Kigali, there had been little hint of the coming vote. Candidates had been barred from putting campaign posters in most public places, including schools and hospitals. The electoral commission vetted candidates’ campaign messages, warning that their social media accounts could be blocked otherwise.

Two decades of often deadly attacks on political opponents, journalists and rights activists created a “climate of fear” ahead of Rwanda’s election, Amnesty International said in a report last month. In 2010, Kagame won election with 93 percent of the vote. In July, he told a campaign rally that “the day of the presidential elections will just be a formality.”

Disclose loan defaults: Sebi to listed firms,"“The entities shall make disclosures within one working day from the date of default at the first instance of default in a specified format,” Sebi said. “The entities shall make disclosures within one working day from the date of default at the first instance of default in a specified format,” Sebi said.

Defaults by listed firms won’t remain secret from October 1, 2017. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked listed companies to disclose details on defaults of loan payment from banks and other financial intuitions to the public within one working day. The Sebi directive to disclose loan defaults runs contrary to the position of banking regulator, Reserve Bank of India, which has been refusing to name the defaulters.

The Sebi directive would come into force from October 1. “This is to enable listed companies to put appropriate systems in place for prompt submission of disclosures as stipulated in the circular,” Sebi said.

“Corporates in India are even today primarily reliant on loans from the banking sector. Many banks are presently under considerable stress on account of large loans to the corporate sector turning into stressed assets, non-performing assets (NPAs). Some firms have also been taken up for initiation of insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings,” Sebi said.

Currently, investors and public are in the dark about defaults by companies and they realise it only when the valuations go down. Some of the top defaulters are now listed on the stock exchanges. The RBI has refused to make public the list of loan defaulters with public banks despite a Supreme Court order to make this information public.

The disclosures should be made to the bourses when the entity has defaulted in payment of interest/instalment obligations on debt securities (including commercial paper), Medium Term Notes (MTNs), foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), loans from banks and financial institutions, external commercial borrowings (ECBs), Sebi said.

The companies would have to inform stock exchanges about date of default as well as date of making such disclosure, name of the lender, number of investors in the security as on date of default, details of the obligation, current default amount and gross principal amount on which the default has occurred. “The entities shall make disclosures within one working day from the date of default at the first instance of default in a specified format,” Sebi said.

The regulator asked firms to make disclosure about debt securities and loans from banks and financial institutions if there is any outstanding amount under default as on the last date of any quarter within seven days from the end of such period. Listed entities would also separately provide information pertaining to defaults to the concerned credit rating agencies in a timely manner and as may be specified by Sebi from time to time.

The Sebi had recently asked listed banks to make disclosures if provisioning and NPAs assessed by the RBI exceeded 15 per cent of published financials. Sebi had said that such disclosures should be made along with the annual financial results filed immediately following communication of such divergence by the RBI to the bank. The move is aimed at helping banks to recognise their stressed assets as non-performing more uniformly.

The RBI’s Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) had identified 12 large accounts of corporate borrowers who owe over Rs 5,000 crore each and involving an overall amount of over Rs 2,00,000 crore for insolvency proceedings under the newly enacted Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC). However, the central bank did not reveal the names of the 12 large defaulters.

Sayani Gupta’s futuristic hairstyle is simply next level amazing,"Sayani Gupta at the Vogue Beauty Awards 2017. (Source: Instagram/aurellebyleshnashah) Sayani Gupta at the Vogue Beauty Awards 2017. (Source: Instagram/aurellebyleshnashah)

Sayani Gupta is a cute, little bundle of energy. The 31-year-old actor is not only a powerhouse of talent but is also one of the best dressed celebs in Bollywood. We have seen her scorch the red carpet over and over again with her impeccable sense of style. Her love for deconstructed silhouettes is quite evident from her numerous appearances and ruffles and off-shoulder designs are something she wears really well. However, her sartorial and beauty experiments are not limited to special events, her casual style is equally compelling. Cool, vibrant and youthful is what comes to our mind when we think about her.

Recently, at the Vogue Beauty Awards the Jagga Jasoos actor gave us another stellar look in an Avaro Figlio outfit. The white top ticked all the right boxes with the cold-shoulder details and gorgeous ruffled sleeves. We also like the touch of the billowy black skirt with a sharp slit.

We think it’s a really cool outfit and she carried it really well. Celebrity stylist Shreeja Rajgopal did an excellent job. But what we like more is how she styled it with the gorgeous, futuristic bouffant hairstyle. Most celebs would have gone for a romantic hairdo, but not Gupta. Trust her to try out new things on the red carpet and get away with it like a pro. The smokey eyes and nude pout added to the magic.

This is not the first time this beauty has given us hairstyle goals with her quirky hairdos. Earlier this year, she worked a samurai bun beautifully with a bardot neckline romper from Forever New.

She also showed us how to wear double buns with a cold-shoulder dress from Samatvam by Anjali Bhaskar and on another occassion, with a striped Lulu & Sky romper.

There was also this time when she impressed us with a high bun and bangs updo with an outfit from JADE by Monica and Karishma.

US State Secretary Rex Tillerson to raise US human rights concerns in Philippines,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (Files) US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (Files)

The Philippines said Friday that it respects human rights and welcomes the opportunity to address the United States’ concerns about its human rights record – a topic expected to be raised by US State Secretary Rex Tillerson when he visits Manila this week for Asia’s biggest security forum.

Tillerson will raise all relevant issues in the US alliance with the Philippines, including concerns about human rights, Acting US Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Susan Thornton said in Washington on Wednesday. She said a meeting with Duterte is being arranged.

A Department of Foreign Affairs statement said the Philippines understands it is part of U.S. officials’ duty to talk about human rights with the Philippines and the rest of the world because they are accountable to their Congress and their press. “We share the belief that no country has a perfect human rights situation,” it added. “We welcome the opportunity to address their concerns and correct the perceptions they may have gleaned from exaggerated media reports.” The statement said the Philippines “is the oldest democracy in Asia and respect for human rights is a shared valued especially with its treaty ally, the United States.”

Discussions on human rights are always included in Philippine engagements with foreign governments particularly with Western democracies, it added. Duterte, however, has lashed out at critics of his war on illegal drugs, which has left thousands of suspects dead in the past year. When then-U.S. President Barack Obama raised concerns about the mounting death toll, Duterte told the president to “go to hell.”

Thornton said Tillerson’s trip to Manila will provide a chance for a robust bilateral program with the Philippines on the sidelines of the security meetings. She said there will be much to talk about, including a siege by Islamic State group-linked militants in the southern city of Marawi and growing threats of international terrorism. “But certainly, we will be talking about governance, about human rights issues, and about how we can increase our economic and other kinds of people-to-people engagement with the Philippines,” she added.

Duterte’s spokesperson, Esrnesto Abella, said no announcement has been made yet of a meeting between Tillerson and Duterte.

Human rights advocates have accused Duterte of unleashing “a human rights calamity” with his war on drugs. They say his recent threat to bomb tribal schools he accused of teaching students to become communist rebels could constitute war crimes, prompting Duterte to clarify that the schools would only be bombed when the buildings are empty.

Amnesty International has urged the United States to restrict assistance to the Philippine national police and to link future aid to progress in reforms and ending the impunity of officers who commit or oversee unlawful killings. It has called for support for Philippine human rights defenders’ efforts to document atrocities, fight for accountability and promote an approach based on public health instead of punitive action.

More than 5,200 drug suspects have died so far, including more than 3,000 in reported gunbattles with police and more than 2,000 others in drug-related attacks by motorcycle-riding masked gunmen and other assaults, police said. Human rights groups have reported a higher toll and called for an independent investigation into Duterte’s possible role in the violence.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte calls Kim Jong Un a ‘fool’ over nuclear ambitions,"“This Kim Jong Un, a fool … he is playing with dangerous toys, that fool,” Duterte told tax officials in a speech. (File photo) “This Kim Jong Un, a fool … he is playing with dangerous toys, that fool,” Duterte told tax officials in a speech. (File photo)

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday described North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “fool” and a “son of a bitch”, just days before Manila hosts an international meeting certain to address Pyongyang’s long-range missile tests.

Duterte held nothing back in rebuking Kim for “playing with dangerous toys”, setting the stage for next week’s rare get-together, to be attended by foreign ministers of all the countries involved in the standoff on the Korean peninsula.

North Korea is determined to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States and officials in Washington said Saturday’s test of an intercontinental ballistic missile showed it may be able to reach most of the country.

“This Kim Jong Un, a fool … he is playing with dangerous toys, that fool,” Duterte told tax officials in a speech.

“That chubby face that looks kind. That son of a bitch. If he commits a mistake, the Far East will become an arid land. It must be stopped, this nuclear war.

“A limited confrontation and it blows up here, I will tell you, the fallout can deplete the soil, the resources and I don’t know what will happen to us.”

This year, Duterte is chairman of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and on Monday his foreign minister will host the ASEAN Regional Forum, which brings together 27 countries that include Australia, China, India, Japan, Russia, North and South Korea and the United States.

It was not the first time Duterte has criticised Kim over his nuclear ambitions. In April he questioned his sanity and urged the United States to show restraint and not be baited by a man who “wants to end the world”.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is due to attend the Manila meeting, on Tuesday said he wanted dialogue with North Korea at some point, stressing it was not the enemy and the United States did not seek to topple the regime.

Telangana: Sircilla villages up in arms against sand mining as trucks crush two,"It all started on July 2 when B Bhudaiah, a Dalit farmer from Neralla village, was crushed by a sand-laden truck. (Source: Google Maps) It all started on July 2 when B Bhudaiah, a Dalit farmer from Neralla village, was crushed by a sand-laden truck. (Source: Google Maps)

Residents of several villages in Sircilla, a newly created district in Telangana, are up in arms against police and district administration over sand mining in the area after sand-laden trucks were involved in several accidents in the past one month. Two persons have been killed and at least 18 injured in separate accidents in the area.

Sircilla is represented in the Assembly by K T Rama Rao, Minister for IT, Municipal Administration and Urban Development, and Panchayati Raj, and son of CM K Chandrashekar Rao. Opposition parties Congress and Left have alleged that the government was targeting Dalits involved in the anti-mining protests.

It all started on July 2 when B Bhudaiah, a Dalit farmer from Neralla village, was crushed by a sand-laden truck. Following the mishap, local residents set afire six trucks. Police arrested 24 persons for the arson, eight of them from Scheduled Castes. They alleged that police tortured them at the behest of contractors because they were opposing sand mining.

Between July 2 and 31, six more accidents took place with sand-laden trucks hitting two-wheelers or pedestrians. On August 1, a sand-laden truck hit a two-wheeler on which K Shankariah and his son Kumar were going to work. Shankariah (56), also a Dalit, died on the spot. On Friday, another truck hit pedestrians near Ellentakunta, injuring at least eight.

SP K Viswajit said both the truck drivers and the motorists and pedestrians were to blame for the accidents. “There is heavy truck traffic in Sircilla because sand required for irrigation and housing projects goes from this region. Some roads are narrow. In the past few days, we have seen an increase in accidents in which both parties are at fault. In the July 2 incident, the victim was on the wrong side of the road. In some incidents, the drivers overspeed and knock down vehicles and pedestrians,’’ he said.

The SP trashed the allegations that eight Dalits arrested for arson were tortured. “It is a coincidence that the two people killed in the accidents belonged to Scheduled Castes. The propaganda that Dalits are being targeted is being done for political gains. This is the constituency of minister K T Rama Rao and some people are spreading false propaganda to defame him,’’ the SP said.

“We have arrested all the drivers involved, but when they are granted bail by courts, local residents accuse police of letting them go scot-free,” he said. State Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said: “The Dalits who were arrested were beaten up so severely that they were hurriedly shifted to a government hospital. Police is not acting against the truck drivers and sand contractors because they have connections with the ruling family.’’

Bengali or Tamil: Limited choices in DU’s new journalism school,"Asked why only Bengali and Tamil were offered as options among Indian languages, he said, “The university faculty will teach students — and we only have faculty for these two languages.” Asked why only Bengali and Tamil were offered as options among Indian languages, he said, “The university faculty will teach students — and we only have faculty for these two languages.”

Studying an Indian language and a foreign language will be compulsory in Delhi University’s newly approved School of Journalism. While students can choose between Chinese, French and Spanish in the foreign language section; among Indian languages, the choice is between Bengali or Tamil. The Delhi School of Journalism (DSJ), which opens from this academic session, offers a five-year integrated course where students will be given an MA degree at the end of the fifth year. The DSJ was approved in the executive council meet held on July 14.

The compulsory languages, which have to be studied in all 10 semesters, carry six credits each. As both languages are compulsory subjects, passing them will be necessary to get a degree. According to a senior university official, these particular languages have been made compulsory so that students have a “variety of options” later. “Knowing these languages will help students get work in regional and international media,” a senior university official reasoned.

Asked why only Bengali and Tamil were offered as options among Indian languages, he said, “The university faculty will teach students — and we only have faculty for these two languages.” In the long-term document plan for the school, the university mentions that more foreign and regional languages will be introduced subsequently, depending on the needs of the programme and the availability of instructors.

The DSJ will be a school under the Faculty of Social Sciences and admission will be done through an entrance test. It is a bilingual course and will be offered both in English and Hindi. A total of 60 students will be admitted to the school. The school had faced opposition earlier from teachers as it was supposed to start in a self-financing mode. Following protests, the university agreed not to do so.

"Russian tourist accused of trespassing given bail, admitted to hospital","The 30-year-old, whose visa expired this January, is undergoing psychiatric treatment. (Express Photo) The 30-year-old, whose visa expired this January, is undergoing psychiatric treatment. (Express Photo)

Russian tourist Ilshat Sagdullin, who was arrested on Thursday for trespassing and creating ruckus in a township here and released on bail on Friday, was admitted to Sola Civil Hospital on Saturday. The 30-year-old, whose visa expired this January, is undergoing psychiatric treatment. “He was screaming when brought to the hospital. He is under medication. We are keeping him under observation. He seems mentally-unstable and keeps saying that he wants to go home. We will be able to reach a clear diagnosis in a few days,” said Dr Hemang Shah, associate professor, Sola Civil Hospital.

Sagdullin spent three nights at Sarkhej Police Station following his detention on Wednesday. An FIR was lodged against him after residents of Orchid Greenfield Towers in Applewoods township complained. “As he had no place to go, we kept him at the police station even after bail. On Friday night, he started screaming. He was uneasy and was not eating. So we thought of taking him to hospital. There are two guards outside his ward. We hope that people from the Russian embassy come soon and deport him. Since, the office is closed till Monday, it looks like we will have to wait till next week to sort the issue out,” said Sub-Inspector S M Pathan.

On Friday, the tourist had said that he was in Goa for six months before coming to Ahmedabad. According to the police, Sagdullin landed in Ahmedabad along with a Russian couple after allegedly being cheated by a travel agent who promised to get his visa processed. The agent also allegedly ran away with his money. “The three met in Goa. Someone told them about another agent, Aalap Shah in Ahmedabad, who could help them. They arrived in Ahmedabad on July 30,” said Pathan.

North Korean missiles add urgency to Hiroshima A-bomb,"A man prays for atomic bomb victims in front of the cenotaph for the victims of the 1945 atomic bombing, at Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, western Japan, August 6, 2017, on the 72nd anniversary of the atomic bombing of the city.

(Reuters)

Hiroshima’s appeal of “never again” on the anniversary of the world’s first atomic bomb attack has acquired renewed urgency as North Korea moves ever closer to acquiring nuclear weapons.

The city marked the 72nd anniversary of the Aug. 6, 1945, attack that killed 140,000 people with a somber ceremony Sunday, a minute of silence to remember the dead and a call to eliminate nuclear weapons.

Mayor Kazumi Matsui said that “hell is not a thing of the past,” urging that the “absolute evil” of atomic weaponry be banished.

North Korea’s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and its recent test-firings of intercontinental ballistic missiles have brought deep unease in Hiroshima, even as many Japanese appear resigned to the growing threat.

"Before bout against Vijender Singh, Zulpikaer Maimaitiali gives a Dangal twist","Chinese boxer Zulpikaer Maimaitiali trains ahead of his bout against Vijender Singh. Chinese boxer Zulpikaer Maimaitiali trains ahead of his bout against Vijender Singh.

Zulipikaer Maimaitiali stops his translator mid-sentence. His grasp of English is vague, but it’s good enough for him to understand immediately that the question is about his emergence as a boxer. “Dangal,” he says, smiling. “My life, Dangal movie. My father, strict boxer.” And on Thursday, two days out from his much-hyped bout against Vijender Singh, you realise what he’d meant by the rather dramatic comparison. The father, Maimaitiali, is in attendance, having flown all the way to oversee the final preparations of his son’s big challenge against the former Olympic bronze medallist. And he watches stone-faced – just as the legendary wrestling coach Mahavir Singh Phogat was depicted training his daughters in the Bollywood hit – as Zulipikaer goes through a quick session of pad-punching with the trainer.

It’s an exercise that father and son are now used to considering Maimaitiali has watched over the 23-year-old throughout the youngster’s career, serving as his manager ever since he started as an amateur in 2007. And he’s remained an integral part of his team when he turned professional three years ago. “He’s always been there with me. Right from the start, making sure I’m on the right track,” says the WBO Oriental Super Middleweight champion.

Even in front of the media, Maimaitiali refuses to let slip even a glimpse of a smile. But he doesn’t mind talking, despite the lengthy process of translation involved. Zulipikaer and his father hail from the Uyghur community in China, a Turkic ethnic group. So while Maimaitiali communicates his thoughts in the Uyghur language to Zulipikaer, the son converts it into Mandarin for the translator to finally respond in English.

Maimaitiali remembers struggling to find a footing as a pugilist while growing up in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in Northwest China. Back then, boxing was not considered a big sport in the country, and opportunities were minimal. “There was no chance of getting promotions to a professional level, and even the amateur options were few,” he says. “It became much better when Zulipikaer was growing up.”

The youngster took up the sport early courtesy of his father’s involvement. Over time, he heard stories about how Maimaitiali was once a budding boxer who never got a chance. “Now I try to fulfill the dreams he couldn’t,” he says. But as Zulipikaer prepares for his 10th professional bout, he finds that its result isn’t just a personal affair. It potentially could influence Chinese boxing to an extent too.

Despite the country boasting two former world champions – Xiong Chaozhog and the legendary Zou Shiming (who won a bronze in Athens 2004, and back-to-back golds in Beijing 2008 and London 2012) – China is yet to open up to the sport. Yet there’s a certain buzz around the upcoming fight against Vijender. “Everyone knows Vijender won his Olympic medal in China. He’s a hero in India, but if I beat him, I’ll be honoured when I go back home. And it will be a symbol of China’s development in boxing,” he says.

So far, the southpaw has remained undefeated in his nine bouts, drawing once and winning eight – including five knockouts. He’s rated as the next world champion from China, though his trainer Julian Howell asserts he’s still three years away from the coveted title match. There are, however, personal benefits Zulipikaer seeks from the fight as well. “It will not be the toughest I will face in my career, but fighting Vijender will show me where I stand, and how to deal with the pressure of defending a title,” he says.

India Kabaddi players shuffling between diet and workout,"Kabaddi players training in Hyderabad. Kabaddi players training in Hyderabad.

Kabaddi’s standing as a traditional game in India brings with it some peculiarities. This may be something that those working at the team hotels may have come to know on the very first day. For example, a curious glance into the plates of the players gave you glimpses of eight or ten rasgullas, quite a few rotis with a questionable sheen to them and other names from a menu that may be strict no-no’s for players involved in other sports.

“Since Kabaddi is a very traditional sport, the diet of the players is reflective of the same – food from their culture from the places they come from,” Haryana Steelers team physio Hayd’n Cody Hill said in an interaction with IndianExpress.com, “While it is good to count the calorie intake, these guys believe that they train hard enough to burn what they have eaten.”

This was echoed by U Mumba captain Anup Kumar, “Yes it is true that we can’t each too much oily stuff as it can create problems for us later,” he said, “But we also train that way.” Kumar said that the players don’t eat without a care in the world on a daily basis. “It’s not that we need to eat a lot of oily food or sweets on a daily basis. Sometimes we do eat that way and eat well too. But we are confident that such indulgences won’t affect us as we train just as hard later.”

If we observe a team going through their training sessions, we get to see exactly what Kumar talks about. For example, in Hyderabad, the Telugu Titans would place a few buckets beside the area where they kept their kit while practicing. Every once in a while, a player would come there, remove his shirt and ring the sweat out into the bucket. They would be full towards the end of the session. “This is the way it is every day,” said a member of the team staff when asked about it.

The support staff of teams in Pro Kabaddi tend to be flexible in the way they set up diet regimes and training schedules. “The whole idea is to get them to eat healthy and then work hard to extract the best out of them,” says Hill, “While the foreign players eat various types of food in limited quantities, the Indian players like to stick to their staple diet – a set menu per say, which is extremely traditional.” This applies to training methods too and, according to Hill, it is important to ensure that players are comfortable with the routines so as to prevent them from becoming hindrances on match days. “We encourage (the Indian players) to work within their ingrained training methods,” he said, ”

At the same time, there are fitness benchmarks that a player has to fulfill so as to make it to the squad. A prime example of that is Sonu Narwal, who was excluded from the Haryana Steelers squad this season.

“We have set parameters for fitness that is representative of any professional team we run and he unfortunately did not meet our standards,” said Hill.

Kabaddi is a game that demands physical strength, speed and skill in ways that is unique to the sport. Similarly, a Kabaddi players’ preparations and conditioning also have their own unique traits. A look at the stats thus far this season would tell us that, no matter what they eat and how they train, Indian players remain a class above their foreign counterparts.

"R Ashwin overtakes Harbhajan Singh in list of most fifers for India in Tests, only behind Anil Kumble now","R Ashwin bagged five wickets in the first innings of the second Test match against Sri Lanka. (Source: AP) R Ashwin bagged five wickets in the first innings of the second Test match against Sri Lanka. (Source: AP)

Indian off-spinner R Ashwin continued with his good run with the ball in Tests when he bagged yet another five-for in the first innings of the second match against Sri Lanka in Colombo. This was Ashwin’s 26th five-wicket haul in Test format and he has now surpassed Harbhajan Singh who has 25 fifers to his name. Former Indian captain Anil Kumble (35) is the only Indian bowler to have more fifer than Ashwin.

The off-spinner’s dismissals included the wickets of Dimuth Karunaratne, Upul Tharanga, Angelo Mathews, Dilruwan Perera and Nuwan Pradeep. Riding on Ashwin’s spell, India managed to enforce a follow-on on Sri Lanka in this particular encounter after the home side was bundled out for 183 in first innings in reply to visitors’ 622/9 (D).

The right-hander troubled the Sri Lankan the batsmen right from the start of the innings as he forced them to edge the ball on a number of occasions with flight and turn. He even made early inroads as he picked two early wickets towards fag end of the second day’s play. The hosts ended the proceedings on the second day at a score of 50/2. Ashwin eventually returned with figures of 5/69 in 16.4 overs which included three maidens in the innings.

Earlier, Indian batsmen hammered Sri Lanka in the first innings. Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane went on to compile individual tons while Ashwin, Wriddhiman Saha and Ravindra Jadeja chipped in with half-centuries. The Virat Kohli-led side already lead the three-match Test series 1-0 and a win in this encounter will give them an unassailable lead.

"In rare bipartisan display, US Democrats back Trump on China trade probe","US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

Three top Democratic senators, in a rare show of bipartisanship, on Wednesday urged US President Donald Trump to stand up to China as he prepares to launch an inquiry into Beijing’s intellectual property and trade practices in coming days.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer pressed the Republican president to skip the investigation and go straight to trade action against China. “We should certainly go after them,” said Schumer in a statement. Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio also urged Trump to rein in China.

Tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated in recent months as Trump has pressed China to cut steel production to ease global oversupply and rein in North Korea’s missile program. Sources familiar with the current discussions said Trump was expected to issue a presidential memorandum in coming days, citing Chinese theft of intellectual property as a problem. The European Union, Japan, Germany and Canada have all expressed concern over China’s behavior on intellectual property theft.

US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would then initiate an investigation under the Trade Act of 1974’s Section 301, which allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect US industries, the sources said.

It is unclear whether such a probe would result in trade sanctions against China, which Beijing would almost certainly challenge before the World Trade Organization. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement to Reuters that China “opposes unilateral actions and trade protectionism in any form.”

Leverage for negotiations

US Section 301 investigations have not led to trade sanctions since the WTO was launched in 1995. In the 1980s, Section 301 tariffs were levied against Japanese motorcycles, steel and other products. “This could merely be leverage for bilateral negotiations,” James Bacchus, a former WTO chief judge and USTR official, said of a China intellectual property probe.

Some trade lawyers said that WTO does not have jurisdiction over investment rules such as China’s requirements that foreign companies transfer technology to their joint venture partners, allowing sanctions to proceed outside the WTO’s dispute settlement system.

But Bacchus argued the United States has an obligation to turn first to the Geneva-based institution to resolve trade disputes, adding: “There is an obligation in WTO to enforce intellectual property rights that is not fully explored.”

Lighthizer and Trump’s Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, have complained the WTO is slow to resolve disputes and biased against the United States. The threat comes at a time when Trump has become increasingly frustrated with the level of support from Beijing to pressure Pyongyang to give up its nuclear and missile program.

Trump has said in the past that China would get better treatment on trade with the United States if it acted more forcefully against Pyongyang. Beijing has said its influence on North Korea is limited. China counters that trade between the two nations benefits both sides, and that Beijing is willing to improve trade ties.

A senior Chinese official said on Monday there was no link between North Korea’s nuclear program and China-U.S. trade.

Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to Lighthizer urging action to stop China from pressuring US tech companies into giving up intellectual property rights. Wyden’s state of Oregon is home to several companies that could make a case regarding intellectual property rights and China, including Nike Inc and FLIR Systems Inc.

"Woman gets 38 stitches after being stabbed, 1 held","Picture for representational purpose Picture for representational purpose

Delhi Police has arrested a 22-year-old man for allegedly attacking an 18-year-old Delhi University student with a blade in north Delhi’s Timarpur area. The woman was injured on the waist and required 38 stitches. According to police, the accused, Sanjeet, was also connected with three earlier cases of robbery, and a burglary case.

Police said there was no CCTV footage or clues from Friday’s incident. “Police collected a list of persons involved in similar incidents. Sanjeet was nabbed on Saturday from the area,” an officer said.

Police said he had got out of jail on July 8, and was a drug and alcohol addict. Police said he wanders around CNG Park in Gandhi Vihar since his parents don’t allow him to enter the house. Upset with his addiction, they had snapped ties with him four years ago, police said. While the woman’s family had pointed to the possibility of stalking, the police probe suggested that the accused wanted to steal her bag.

Mumbai: BMC told to recover Rs 101 crore ‘avoidable’ payment to Mumbai Port Trust,"The PAC, in its report tabled before the Legislative Council on Friday, has demanded an action taken report within three months. (Reuters) The PAC, in its report tabled before the Legislative Council on Friday, has demanded an action taken report within three months. (Reuters)

Expressing displeasure over the avoidable payment of Rs 101.32 crore to Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) as commission for crude oil, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of state government has demanded the BMC to explore all ways to recover it and take action, after fixing the responsibility, against the officials for making the payment. The report noted that the amount could have been put to use for other important public works.

The PAC, in its report tabled before the Legislative Council on Friday, has demanded an action taken report within three months. The report noted that the BMC should not have made payments in a hurry to the MbPT. As per the standing committee resolution of 1954, the MbPT was collecting the Octroi, on behalf of the civic body, on the imported crude oil and the BMC was paying 3 percent commission for it.

According to the report, the BMC took a decision to discontinue 3 percent commission being given to MbPT and collect the Octroi directly from Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) in 2010. But, the civic body continued to pay commission to MbPT till September 2013. During this period, BMC paid Rs 101.32 crore to MbPT.

The report noted the PAC does not agree with BMC’s stand that it required consent from MbPT for discontinuation of commission. “The decision was taken in 2010 and the correspondence was going on with MbPT seeking its consent. So, there was no need to make payments of commission and it could have been put on hold,” it stated. “BMC should not have made the payment in a hurry. After the MbPT gave its consent in 2013, it should have implemented it retrospectively from 2010.”

The report further said the payment could have been avoided as per rules and on merit. “This is not a small sum and could have been put to use for other important public works,” remarked the

committee.

The committee has suggested that since the payment has already been made, the civic body should study all the options of recovering it and should take further action as per rules. “Also, it should fix the responsibility on those officials, involved in making payment despite the decision taken in 2010, and take necessary action against them,” stated the committee.

UP Jails to host events on Deendayal Upadhyaya every Saturday till September 25,"Deendayal Upadhyay. (Representational Image) Deendayal Upadhyay. (Representational Image)

Prisons have been holding various events to spread awareness of BJP’s ideologue Deendayal Upadhyaya among inmates on his birth centenary. In orders issued to this effect in June, the government has asked jails to organise programmes on every Saturday till the centenary celebrations conclude on September 25. One such programme was organised in Kanpur District Jail on Saturday where BJP district president Surendra Maithani was invited to give a speech on the life and ideology of Upadhyay. Maithani also spoke of the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said his party would help inmates to return to mainstream society upon their release and asked them to visit the local party office.

Maithani told The Indian Express that Girish Bajpai, who is a BJP worker convicted of rioting in Kanpur in 1991, anchored the programme. He claimed that he had contacted the jail himself and expressed his wish to deliver the lecture. “Deendayal’s ideology is for the deprived section of society. These inmates are deprived from mainstream,” he added. Kanpur jail superintendent Ashish Tiwari said all departments have been asked to invite people associated with Upadhyaya’s ideology to deliver a lecture.

Kanpur jail deputy jailer Rajesh Kumar Rai, who is coordinating the programmes, said: “It was decided that a lecture will be organised on the first Saturday of the month, essay writing on the second, an art competition on the third and poem writing on the fourth.” Local senior BJP leader Ramdeo Shukla had delivered the first lecture last month.

“As we do not know much about Deendayal Upadhyayji, BJP leaders are being invited to deliver the lecture,” said Rai. He added that the jail had brought books on Upadhyay for its library.

UEFA Super Cup: Jose Mourinho faces defensive woes ahead of Real Madrid clash,"Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho may have to employ an out-of-form Chris Smalling with struggling new arrival Victor Lindelof in defence. REUTERS Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho may have to employ an out-of-form Chris Smalling with struggling new arrival Victor Lindelof in defence. REUTERS

“Has he (Victor Lindelof) made some mistakes? Yes, he has. The one against Real Madrid, if I am real, it’s the one that would concern me… Lindelof did not realise that he was so late on the challenge to gave the penalty away and carried forward with it. That would concern me,” former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol said in a recent interview.

It was nasty challenge on Real Madrid left-back Theo Hernandez by the newly-bought Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof that saw his side giving away a penalty in a friendly fixture between the two sides at Levi’s Stadium in California. From the standards of a friendly fixture, it was a challenge, well, too extreme (after all it was a game in which both the sides were literally escorted on the field by Ronald McDonald).

The disastrous performances in the pre-season have left critics wondering if Manchester United has made a mistake by signing the 23-year old Swede from Benfica. Known as “The Iceman” because of his cool and calm nature, Lindelof before his arrival was compared with United’s former Defensive maestro Nemanja Vidic. But after a horrid pre-season, fans are having to use Vidic comparison to defend his performances (Vidic too saw a tough start to his United campaign).

Amid all the doubts, Jose Mourinho’s side are gearing up for a tough opponent in Real Madrid on Tuesday for the UEFA Super Cup. And for Lindelof, it is an opportunity to make amends for his pre-season fiasco. Unfortunately for the young defender, the defensive woes for the Red Devils does not end with him.

United’s trusted center-back Eric Bailly has received a three-match ban from European tournaments, after he received a red card in last season Europa League clash against Celta Vigo, and will not play a part on Tuesday. Moreover, Phil Jones, who partnered with Marcus Rojo last season to give a sustainable, if not supreme, central defensive unit to the side, has been handed a two UEFA match ban for abusing a doping official at Europa League final clash against Ajax.

Even though United has appealed the decision, and reports suggest the decision might come in the Red Devil’s favour, the final judgment will come on May 7, just a day before the game, and United cannot take the risk of not preparing for an alternative.

But alternatives are not too promising either for Mourinho’s side. Against the quality of attacking prowess available with Zinedine Zidane’s side, United may have to field out-of-form Chris Smalling along with Lindelof, owing to knee injury sustained by Rojo last year that will see him out of action at least till September. The manager might even think about placing Blind at central defence, but it would leave him with no solid left back to play along with, as Luke Shaw is also out with injury.

While Matteo Darmian has become new dependable option for Mourinho of late at the position, the trio of Lindelof, Blind and Darmian, hardly promise a solid defensive unit. Moreover, the 27-year old Italian defender might not be a favourable option for the manager owing to his weak crossing abilities. Mourinho will most likely employ Blind at his favourable left-back position with “experience” but out-of-form Smalling at centre along with Lindelof.

The Champion League winners Real Madrid have an opportunity to become the only team to win two consecutive UEFA Super Cup trophies since Inter Milan won it 1989 and 1990 and Zidane will give everything to accomplish the feat. Recent visuals of Cristiano Ronaldo’s training sessions hint that the Portuguese star might be part of the team set-up at the clash. Against the likes of Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Luka Modric and possible Gareth Bale, United’s defence cannot afford to make the same mistakes as pre-season.

While Lindelof needs to buckle up and improve the timings of his challenges, Smalling needs to play a steady game to improve his confidence and try to re-establish faith among manager and fans. Blind is certain to have a hard game against the likes of Bale, Lucas Vasquez and/or Dani Carvajal. But the Dutch defender needs to sharpen his defensive skills, and prove to Mourinho he can retain his cool against tough oppositions. If United’s defence slips up again, Los Blancos will not let them take the victory through a penalty shootout this time around.

Government extends deadline to get Aadhaar for free LPG,"Representational Image/ Reuters Representational Image/ Reuters

The government has extended till September-end the time by which poor women wishing to avail of free cooking gas (LPG) connections must apply for the unique 12-digit biometric identification number Aadhaar. The government had in March this year mandated that anyone not having Aadhaar but desirous of availing free LPG connection under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana must apply for it by May 31.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas yesterday issued a gazettee notification extending that deadline to September 30. The government had in October last year made the unique identification number mandatory for everyone to get LPG subsidies. In March this year it was extended for free cooking gas connections to women of BPL households.

“A beneficiary desirous of availing the benefits under the Scheme (PMUY), who does not possess the Aadhaar number or has not yet enrolled for Aadhaar shall have to apply for Aadhaar enrolment by 31st May, 2017, provided she is entitled to obtain Aadhaar,” the notification issued on March 6 had said.

In yesterday’s notification, the ministry said: “The figures, letters and word ’31st May, 2017′, the figures, letters and word ’30th September, 2017′ shall be substituted.” The government had last year launched the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana to provide 5 crore poor women with free LPG connections in three years with a view to providing clean cooking fuel. So far over 2.6 crore free connections have been provided.

“Individual beneficiary desirous of availing the benefits under the scheme (PMUY) is hereby required to furnish proof of possession of Aadhaar number or undergo Aadhaar authentication,” said the March 6 gazette notification.

Those below poverty line (BPL) women looking to avail free LPG connection but do not have the Aadhaar number, have been asked to apply for it by September 30. Once enrolled for Aadhaar, the beneficiary can apply for free LPG connection by providing the enrolment ID slip or a copy of such a request.

Such application will have to be accompanied by one of the government identification documents like bank passbook with photograph, election voter ID, ration card, permanent account number (PAN), passport, driving licence, kisan photo passbook or a certificate of identity having a photo issued by a gazetted officer on an official letterhead, it said.

The ministry has asked state-owned fuel retailing firms to facilitate enrolment of beneficiaries for biometric identification number, Aadhaar. The government currently gives 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg each at subsidised rates per household in a year. The subsidy on every cylinder is transfered in advance directly into bank accounts of individuals, who then buy the cooking fuel at market rates.

In a six-man final, Mittal shot 71 and finished at top of the podium. India also grabbed the top prize in the team event as Sangram Dahiya (43) and Mohammad Asab (34) scores were also added to Mittal’s final total.

Dahiya had to contend with the fourth position in the individual event, whereas Asab finished in the fifth place. In the qualification, Mittal shot 137 trailing behind the top position holder Dahiya (140) as well as Asab (138).

Earlier this year, Mittal clinched a gold medal at the International Shooting Sports Federation World Cup in Acapulco, Mexico. Previously to that, he also won a silver in season’s inaugural World Cup in New Delhi.

When the year’s first World Cup began in New Delhi, Mittal was one among the host of fresh faces to feature alongside some experienced Indian shooters with the likes off Jitu Rai, Gagan Narang and Heena Sidhu. He has raised his game and has come up gradually through the junior ranks.

In Men’s double trap event, UAE’s Khaled Alkaabi (70) won the silver medal and Saif Alshamsy (53) clinched a bronze.

Case thrown out against former Thai PM Somchai Wongsawat in rare win for anti-junta camp,"(Source: Reuters) (Source: Reuters)

A Thai court on Wednesday dismissed a case against former prime minister Somchai Wongsawat, a brother-in-law of deposed former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, in a rare victory for the pro-Thaksin, anti-junta movement. Somchai, along with then-deputy prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyuth, was accused of abuse of power over a deadly crackdown on demonstrators in 2008. Two people died and hundreds were wounded when police used tear gas to clear anti-government “yellow shirt” protesters who had parliament in Bangkok. “Even though there were people who were injured and killed, in that event it was difficult for police to know that the tear gas would cause injuries and death in that manner,” the court said in a statement released after the verdict. His opponents accused Somchai of being Thaksin’s puppet.

Thaksin, who lives abroad to avoid a jail sentence handed down for graft in 2008, was ousted in a 2006 coup but remains a major influence over Thai politics. The Shinawatra family and their political allies are at the heart of a political conflict that has divided Thailand for more than a decade.

The crisis pits former telecommunications tycoon Thaksin, and his legions of supporters, against the Bangkok-based elite which sees him as a threat to the old royalist-military establishment. Members of the Shinawatra family have accused their opponents of political persecution. The 2008 protest by the People’s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) group, an anti-Thaksin movement whose street action led ultimately to the 2006 coup against Thaksin, was among the worst political crises in recent Thai history.

In October that year, protesters surrounded parliament forcing Somchai to escape over a back fence after delivering a policy address. Police dispersed protesters with volleys of tear gas. At least 400 were wounded. Wednesday’s ruling upset former members of the now-defunct PAD. Some stood outside the court after the ruling and shouted: “Murder!”. The military took power in Thailand in a 2014 coup, ousting Thaksin’s sister, prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra.

Pages: 400

Price: Rs 399

In the flaky firmament of “bestsellers” and “pacy reads”, John Grisham has arguably been as steady as the northern star, when it comes to legal thrillers. Now he’s back with Camino Island, his latest. But get this: Camino Island’s intrigue unspools in a Florida beach town and the core premise revolves around rare books.

A departure from the usual lawyer-setting, Grisham’s book remains taut as ever right from the get-go: the story starts with an incredible heist at Princeton University’s Firestone Library — original manuscripts of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s works such as The Great Gatsby and Tender Is the Night are stolen.The FBI gets on board. A security firm, working for Princeton’s insurance company, thinks it has a lead in an obvious target: an eminent bookstore owner named Bruce Cable with a shady history and a penchant for philandering like his life depended on it. But they need an insider. Enter Mercer Mann, a pretty and debt-ridden young novelist. Will she be the bait or is Cable not the man behind the heist after all?

"It’s a long ride ahead: A trans woman talks about a new world, and the old one that still drags her down","Trans-port: Employees of the Kochi Metro. Trans-port: Employees of the Kochi Metro.

Inside a little room in Kakkanad in the heart of Kochi City, a 25-year-old is getting ready for work. Dressed in a pair of jeans and a top, she rushes out to the Toyota Innova waiting outside, filled with her colleagues.

Sulfi gets down at the Muttom yard, the headquarters of the Kochi Metro where she works as an office assistant. She is one of the 23 trans people employed by the Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) as their staff. She is a person with an arresting appearance — full lips, big doe eyes, and a head of wavy hair. “Hope you are not getting carried away by my looks as most people are. I am not a woman,’’ she teases. A man who chooses to identify as a woman, Sulfi is a transgender person from Alappuzha, some 100 km away.

From a very young age, Sulfi wanted to be a girl even though she had the physical attributes of a boy. “It was a terrible dilemma. I never wanted to play with boys since I saw myself as a girl. But the girls never accepted me too,’’ she says. While school had its share of unpleasant experiences, her parents were supportive. They also suggested a sex reassignment surgery. But she declined. “There may be people who prefer surgery. But I am happy about the way I am. Does that mean I can’t be a woman if I want to be?’’ she asks.

According to the 2014 judgement of the Supreme Court, she can. The landmark NALSA ruling holds up the rights of the third gender, as well as of an individual to choose the gender she identifies with. Last month, a parliamentary committee report on the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016, criticised the government for ignoring issues of marriage and adoption of trans people — the first government document to recognise civil union in the community.

After her parents had died a few years ago, Sulfi moved in with her sister and her family, who also lived in Alappuzha. It was an uneventful life till a quarrel broke out between her and a girl in the neighbourhood. The latter approached the local police station with a case of molestation, and the cops were at their doorstep. “I had to disclose to everyone in the neighbourhood that I am a transgender; that I am not sexually attracted to women. This let me off the case but made me homeless,’’ she says. Even though her sister was aware of her identity, she turned Sulfi, then a Class X student, out of her home. “It shattered me but I have no regrets. If they had not thrown me out, I would not have applied for a job at the Metro. It opened a new world for me,’’ she says.

She left home in December 2015 — a time she refuses to recollect. “I have been through hell. I had to do a lot of dirty things to stay alive, including sex work. But when you are thrown out of your house, this is perhaps the easiest way to get on with life,’’ she says.

At the Muttom office, she has made friends, after a few initial hiccups. “I had gone into the ladies’ washroom, which some people did not like. But then the supervisor gave strict instructions that such discrimination will not be allowed. It will take time and we can understand that. Nothing changes overnight,’’ Sulfi says.

While the KMRL was hailed for employing trans persons, the end to discrimination is a long way off. Nine out of the 23 people have already quit the job as no one was willing to rent a house to them. KMRL has now arranged a hostel at Kakkanad, run by the local church, where Sulfi and a few others are staying. A few families in Kochi have also come forward to provide space to the community.

Of those who got the jobs, those educated till the secondary level have been employed in ticketing and customer care, while the rest cater to housekeeping and general cleaning. None was given a job to drive a train.

Raga Rangini, 32, works at the ticket counter at the Edapally station and is Sulfi’s friend. “When the Metro job was announced, we were over the moon. This was our first shot at a respectable job. We have only done hard labour and menial jobs before,’’ says Rangini, who is from Thrissur and now lives with her partner in Kochi.

Rangini loves every bit of the new role which she has taken, even if the reactions from the commuters have been mixed. “There was this guy who was so surprised to see me that he went to the next counter. There, too, my friend was sitting. You should have seen his face. We both had a hearty laugh,” she says.

It is the end of the workday and Rangini and Sulfi are about to head home. Since Rangini stays with her partner, she has to get home and cook. Sulfi is waiting for her boyfriend and they plan to watch a movie in the evening.

She might not take a bus to the cinema—a form of public transport, where she has often faced a lot of discrimination. “Usually, we are looked down upon and even thrown out of buses because we are labelled as pickpockets The other day I had taken a bus to work. As usual, no one was ready to share a seat with me. But one woman came forward and sat next to me. She spoke to me. It felt so nice. Such things happen so rarely you know,’’ she says.

Naveen Nair is a freelance writer in Kochi.

"This class 5 student runs library in Bhopal slum, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan pitches in to help","Muskaan Ahirwar. (File photo) Muskaan Ahirwar. (File photo)

While most children of her age spend time in playing or studying, this 11-year-old girl has started a small library to encourage reading. Meet class 5 student, Muskaan Ahirwar, who while living in a slum area of Bhopal has found that books are the best way to promote knowledge. Her determination has been recognised by the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who has offered her a financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh to set up a proper library. Chouhan met the girl at his residence on Wednesday and handed her a cheque of Rs 2 lakh.

The 11-year-old girl’s efforts have now been recognised by promised Muskaan to build a one-room library for her, an official of the public relations department said. “The situation would soon change if girls like Muskan are extended support by the whole society. The government will extend all possible support,” Chouhan said while handing over the cheque to the girl.

This started when State Education Board visited this slum and handed over about 25 books to children to share and read. They found Muskaan been more curious about it. As per a TOI report, the officials decided to give this responsibility to Muskaan of educating other students in slum which she happily took.

Ahirwar now runs the small library – ‘Bal Pustakalaya’ – from her make-shift house. She started with 25 educational books which have now grown and accommodates around 1,000 books.”

The girl lost hope of continuing the library after the death of her father, Manohar Ahirwar, on July 7 this year. However, after receiving the financial assistance from the chief minister, the girl says now nothing can stop her and the other slum children from moving ahead.

“Papa used to say do something big, study hard,” says Muskan, who wants to be a doctor.

Her library remains open between 5 pm and 7 pm every day.

“Nearly 20 to 25 children come to the library (every day). They have to sit on a mat. A few children take the books to their homes and return it later. In a bid to know if they read the books, I sometimes ask questions from it,” she says.

Muskan says she also maintains a register of the library’s accounts.

President Donald Trump blames Congress for ‘all-time’ low US-Russia relations,"In his signing statement to implement sanctions on Russia, President Trump had expressed his disagreement with certain provisions of the bill even though he said he supported new sanctions on Russia. (Source: AP)

President Donald Trump today blamed Congress for “an all-time” and “very dangerous” low in US’ relations with Russia, a day after he reluctantly signed into law a bill imposing tough sanctions against Moscow under mounting domestic pressure. Trump signed into law a legislation that imposes tough sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea and limits his ability to lift the curbs unilaterally.

The signing of the bill put to rest questions about whether Trump would support the legislation passed overwhelmingly by Congress last week.

“Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous low. You can thank Congress, the same people that can’t even give us HCare!” Trump wrote on twitter.

Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous low. You can thank Congress, the same people that can’t even give us HCare! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2017

The “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,” which enacts new sanctions on Iran, North Korea and Russia was passed by both the chambers of the Congress – House of Representatives and the Senate – by an overwhelming majority.

In his signing statement, Trump had expressed his disagreement with certain provisions of the bill even though he said he supported new sanctions on Russia.

“The bill remains seriously flawed – particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch’s authority to negotiate. Congress could not even negotiate a healthcare bill after seven years of talking,” Trump said.

“By limiting the Executive’s flexibility, this bill makes it harder for the United States to strike good deals for the American people, and will drive China, Russia and North Korea much closer together. The framers of our Constitution put foreign affairs in the hands of the President. This bill will prove the wisdom of that choice,” he said.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that the President favours tough measures to punish and deter the rogue regimes in Iran and North Korea for the bad behaviour.

“He also sent a clear signal that we won’t tolerate interference in our democratic process by Russia,” she said.

“The bill was improved, but Congress has encroached on the power of the presidency, and he signed it in the interest of national unity. We’ve been very clear that we support tough sanctions on all three of those countries. We continue to do so,” Sanders said.

Russia has responded to these sanctions by reducing the size of US mission in Russia and asking several hundreds of American officials there to leave.

Trump’s presidency has been marred by accusations that his campaign team colluded with Moscow during last year’s US presidential polls in which he defeated Hillary Clinton.

‘Venezuelan opposition leader Lopez returned to house arrest’,"Opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez (AP Photo/File) Opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez (AP Photo/File)

Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was returned to house arrest after being detained in military prison for four days, his wife Lilian Tintori said. “They just moved Leopoldo home,” Tintori wrote on Twitter. “We continue with more conviction and strength for peace and freedom in Venezuela!”

Lopez, 46, was already under house arrest when he was picked up by Venezuelan intelligence services overnight Monday, one day after a vote to choose a powerful constituent assembly tasked with rewriting the constitution. He was first arrested in 2014 and released to home detention last month.

Another high-profile dissident, Antonio Ledezma, 62, was released back to house arrest Friday after being hauled away the same day as Lopez. He had already been in home detention since 2015. Following their arrests the Venezuelan Supreme Court alleged that they had been planning to flee, either into hiding in Venezuela or abroad.

The arrests triggered stern international criticism, with US President Donald Trump saying the pair were “political prisoners being held illegally by the regime,” which he dubbed “the Maduro dictatorship.”

Also yesterday the new assembly loyal to the embattled Maduro fired the country’s attorney general, Luisa Ortega, one of the president’s most vociferous critics, sparking a firestorm of condemnation from the US and Latin American nations.

"‘When ultra-nationalism is on the rise, it divides citizens into those whom the state should be proud of, and everyone else’","Kamila Shamsie. Kamila Shamsie.

What is the seed of Home Fire (Bloomsbury, Rs 599)? Were you trying to understand why young men and women are leaving in search of the Caliphate?

It began with a suggestion from Jatinder Verma, a theatre director in London, that I adapt Antigone as a play for the contemporary times. I started to think about it, and, almost immediately, I knew the story I wanted to tell — but as a novel, rather than a play.

At first, the point of interest was not the story of the young men and women going to join the Islamic State. It was the British government wanting to strip the citizenship of those who had gone away to join IS. I had recently become a British citizen. I am a dual national of Pakistan and Britain, and I was aware that there were increasing powers to strip citizenship of dual nationals. Under what circumstances, does a state say that my citizen is responsibility? And at what point does it say, ‘I don’t like what my citizens are doing, so I will stop making them my citizens instead of dealing with them’? That was the larger issue.

What kind of research did this involve? How did the South African playwright Gillian Slovo’s work Another World: How We Lost Our Children to Islamic State help you?

I was lucky that Gillian was working on this play. She interviewed a lot of people, particularly the mothers of people who left for the Islamic State. There was quite a lot that I was able to get through her. But because there are a lot of scenes in Raqqa in the novel — and there was no question of going there — I had to do a fair amount of online research. As a novelist, you fill in the gaps. But I was nervous about going online looking for all that stuff, because you are so aware of a surveillance state now.

Did you get a fairer understanding of what it is to be a young Muslim in the western world?

I suppose, you know, it’s something I am aware of — being a Muslim in a western world. But, obviously, I haven’t grown up here. And it is a very different thing if your sense of self has been established somewhere else and you come here, and adapt, as I did.

One of the things Slovo did was to go and talk to young Muslim students, 13 or14 or 15 years old, who had grown up here. On the one hand, they feel completely British. There is no question of belonging to any other nation, but they are also very aware of being viewed with suspicion. When she asked them, ‘What do you know about Islamic State?’, they said we deliberately don’t look at that kind of information because we are worried about what people might think. I was struck by the strong sense of being watched and being under suspicion in these British citizens.

In the novel, Parvaiz is a young man with doting and powerful sisters, and he is weaned away by the Islamic State because he is looking for his father. How does masculinity and femininity help you understand violence?

To me, it is obvious and inextricable that if you have to look at violence, you have to look at issues around masculinity. And tied to that is the need for father figures. Young boys have to grapple with the idea of what it is to be a man in ways which girls don’t.

Someone like Parvaiz should have been a feminist. He has seen how amazing women can be. But Farooq [his handler] is able to pull out of him just that little bit that believes men should be in positions of superiority, and that he is not being a proper man because he allows the women in his life to be more powerful. That is very much part of patriarchal cultures everywhere.

How did a classical Greek tragedy intersect with contemporary Britain?

I think it is interesting that there has been a revival of Greek plays on the London stage in recent years. These are periods of darkness and change in Britain. And the Greeks are very good at all that, at distilling things to the essence.

One of the ways of looking at Antigone is to see how the state is trying to exert a certain kind of control over the life and death of its citizens. But there is one woman who will not accept that. She can be read either as a heroic figure or someone who is incredibly stubborn and foolish, and doesn’t want to accept any boundaries. To me it became this interesting question of what you owe the state, and what the state owes you. That’s central to Antigone.

It is also about heightened emotions. The play is so much about grief and anger, and what you do in grief and anger, the decisions you take in grief and anger. The more anger you have in the world, the more the Greeks will become pertinent.

This is a more urgent, more immediate and less lyrical work, compared to your last novel (A God in Every Stone, 2014). Did you work differently? Did you worry that the human story might be drowned by the politics?

I think that was a worry with the last one as well, in a different way. The worry then was that the history would drown out [the novel]. With this one, the worry was that the contemporary politics would drown it out. But then, as a novelist, there are always challenges you are taking on.

I hadn’t intended for the writing style to be so different. But the original Greek is so slim and pared down, that that is there in the marrow of the novel. It is much less lyrical. Somewhere, I wanted the writing to be almost invisible.

Who is a citizen? Why are so many versions of this debate being heard in contemporary world?

When ultra-nationalism is on the rise, this is what is going to happen. It divides citizens into those whom the state should be proud of, and everyone else — even though legally they may have the same rights, they are seen as lesser, and it becomes easier to enact violence and injustice against them.

A couple of generations ago, left and right were the ideologies to which people attached themselves. But across the world, those have broken down. People are looking for different kinds of identifications, within your religion, your ethnicity, your family. There is a need for belonging in people.

It was one of the things that struck me when I was looking at the propaganda of Islamic State, which is not only about violence. A lot of it is about belonging, and questions of racism. Its promise is that you can come here and be with your brothers (it is not really designed for women). Here is a place where no one will treat you differently for your skin colour. The Islamic State taps into the need for belonging and the dissatisfaction with the state of belonging people are in.

Fiction enlarges your empathy. Do you hope that this novel allows the blacks and the whites to become grey?

There is black and white, of course. I don’t want someone to read it and say, okay, maybe Islamic State isn’t so bad after all. But it really struck me how young some of these men going to the IS were — 17- and 18-year-olds, barely out of childhood. And just to say that they are evil and violent…what is going on here? What is being done to them? That is a question I hope people will think about.

You wrote in The Guardian about how getting a British citizenship was a form of being betrayed and a betrayal? Is loyalty something you think about a lot?

Personally, I do not feel conflicted in my loyalties to two countries. That I have these two different nations is a source of strength rather than any kind of conflict for me. But these are questions I see in the world quite a lot. As a writer, I am interested in them. Through my novels, I want to understand this better.

When you are not writing, what keeps you going? Friends, food, cricket?

I am a cricket fan. I was at the ICC Women’s World Cup final and it was amazing. I have been wanting to see Jhulan Goswami play for about 10 years now. It really was a joy to finally be able to do that before she retired. She really is extraordinary.

Cricket takes up a fair amount of time. I travel quite a bit. Reading, watching rubbish TV, Game of Thrones. I spend a lot of the day at my desk reading and step out in the evening to meet a few friends. I have no fascinating hobbies like raising tarantulas.

What do you think of the political climate in India? Is it something that is familiar to a Pakistani?

The thing that makes it unfamiliar is that in Pakistan we are used to a lot of awful things under military rule or by non-state actors. What is worrying in many countries of the world, right now, is the democratic election of ultranationalists. I grew up in a military dictatorship thinking that there are certain kinds of things that don’t happen in a democracy. And now that seems a very naive way of seeing the world.

It also seems, sometimes, that in India and Pakistan we are still caught up in 1947. That there is no escaping history. But the thing is that there are many pasts. So 1947 was about a terrible Partition but leading up to it, there was a freedom struggle, great acts of heroism and political coming together. So the question is: which moment of the past seems to define us? Right now, it seems to be the darkest moments. When you are stuck in the bleakest places, it is hard to remember that history is full of ups and downs, that it is full of moments of triumph as well. But we ought to remember that.

Airport security loophole fears after Australia plane plot,"Security remains heightened in airports around Australia with more intense screening of luggage after law enforcement officials said they had thwarted a plan to bring down an airliner. (Dean Lewins/AAP Image via AP) Security remains heightened in airports around Australia with more intense screening of luggage after law enforcement officials said they had thwarted a plan to bring down an airliner. (Dean Lewins/AAP Image via AP)

Major security gaps persist at Australian airports despite authorities’ efforts to tighten screenings after thwarting an alleged terror plot to blow up a plane, the pilots’ union has warned. Four men were arrested in Sydney on Saturday, accused of planning an attack using an improvised explosive device, prompting authorities to tighten security at airports across the nation.

But pilots, who have to be screened alongside air crew, retail workers and passengers, said similar requirements were not in place for ground staff, who are instead issued with security cards. “Pilots and cabin crew are routinely screened along with passengers but a lot of ground staff can access aircraft on the tarmac without the same level of scrutiny,” Australian Airline Pilots Association president Murray Butt said late yesterday.

“We believe it would enhance airport security if all airline staff who have access to aircraft, were screened to the same level as personnel entering through the terminal.” The concerns came as Sydney’s Daily Telegraph cited sources alleging the plot involved using an unwitting passenger to carry a bomb onboard, with Etihad Airways confirming this week it was helping the investigation.

Aviation experts have also warned about loopholes, such as the use of private-sector security guards instead of government employees at airports, and no photo ID checks for passengers at domestic terminals.

Butt said Australia needed to emulate the US requirement for photo ID checks for passengers, while a former Sydney Airport security chief said security databases should be linked to booking systems. “The scary thing is domestic airlines have no idea who is really on their aircraft,” Mike Carmody told The Australian Financial Review.

“There is very little coordination. Unless you happen to be someone who really stands out, you are going to fly right through security.” Transport Minister Darren Chester today defended the current measures, saying workers with access to large passenger planes must hold a security card only issued after thorough checks.

“We’ve endeavoured to toughen up regulations around getting access to those cards, and making sure that people who have access to the airport environment are trusted,” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “So it’s been recognised that there are issues around the world in relation to the threat provided by the so-called trusted insider… and we are taking measures to keep the Australian travelling public safe.”

One of the four men was released without charge yesterday. Police have until the weekend to hold the other three after obtaining a court extension. Australia’s national terror alert level was raised in September 2014 amid concerns over attacks by individuals inspired by organisations such as IS.

"New ETF Bharat-22 launched, includes ONGC, ITC, SBI scrips","Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Secretary, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management Neeraj Kumar Gupta in New Delhi on Friday. (Source: PTI Photo) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Secretary, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management Neeraj Kumar Gupta in New Delhi on Friday. (Source: PTI Photo)

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday announced the launch of a new exchange-traded fund (ETF), called Bharat-22, which comprises 22 scrips including ONGC, IOC, ITC, SBI and Axis Bank. This is a much broader ETF than the earlier fund and comprises stocks of banks as well. This will be the second ETF from the government after it raised over Rs 8,509 crore from three tranches of the CPSE ETF.

Bharat-22 will have a diversified portfolio of six sectors, including energy, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), finance, basic material and industrial and utilities, Jaitley said while briefing reporters. ICICI Prudential AMC will be the ETF manager and Asia Index Private Limited will be the Index provider.

Apart from banks and CPSEs, the ETF will include shares of government’s strategic holding in Axis Bank, ITC and L&T held through SUUTI (Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India). “While selecting each of these sectors, we have kept in mind sectoral reforms which have had direct impact on the valuation of these shares… We believe that this ETF will be a fairly successful one,” Jaitley said.

ETF functions just like a mutual fund scheme but its units are traded on the stock exchange. Among energy and mining companies ONGC, IOC, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco are part of the new ETF. In the Budget Speech of 2017-18, Jaitley said the government will use ETF as a vehicle for further disinvestment of shares.

The government plans to raise a total of Rs 72,500 crore through divestment in the current fiscal year. The government has so far raised around Rs 9,300 crore through nine disinvestment transactions. The other CPSEs on the list are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India.

Only three PSU banks — SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda — figure in the Bharat-22 index. A list of 22 companies effectively means that small tranches of government holding in CPSEs and PSBs will be included, he added. Jaitley said the inclusion of three PSU banks in Bharat-22 is “consistent” with the government’s policy. “Government’s stake can go down to 52 per cent in PSU banks and whenever possible, we will look for a possible consolidation,” he added.

ETF investment is less risky and provides liquid assets which are traded real time and is a transparent mode of investment, Jaitley said. “Globally ETF assets have grown significantly, with around $4 trillion worth Assets Under Management (AUM). These are expected to touch $7 trillion by 2021. Large Investors (Sovereign/Pension Funds) prefer investing in ETFs,” the finance ministry said in a statement.

The first CPSE ETF consisted of scrips of 10 PSUs – ONGC, Coal India, IOC, GAIL (India), Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, Engineers India and Container Corporation of India. Asked when the first tranche of Bharat-22 will hit the market, DIPAM Secretary Neeraj Gupta “It will be different tranches as per requirement of the government,” he said. DIPAM is the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management. “Ninety per cent of the equities included are also traded in futures,” Gupta said.

"China, BRICS trade ministers vow to fight protectionism","China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan attends a news conference of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) trade ministers meeting in Shanghai, China. (Source: Reuters) China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan attends a news conference of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) trade ministers meeting in Shanghai, China. (Source: Reuters)

China and the other BRICS nations pledged on Wednesday to fight protectionism and safeguard intellectual property rights, even as US President Donald Trump considers action against what he sees as unfair trade practices by China.

Trade ministers from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa concluded two days of meetings in Shanghai agreeing to deepen trade and investment links, and “safeguard and develop” the multilateral trading system, according to a statement by Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan.

“Ministers were committed to continue to firmly oppose trade and investment protectionism, recommitted to their existing pledge for both standstill and rollback of protectionist measures, and called upon countries to join in that commitment,” the statement said.

The ministers also approved guidelines for cooperation between the five countries on intellectual property rights (IPR).

“Ministers agreed to promote exchanges and cooperation on IPR legislation and enforcement in order to create favourable conditions for trade and innovation-driven economic development,” the statement said.

On Tuesday, a senior Trump administration official said Trump could decide as early as this week on how to respond to what he considers China’s unfair trade practices.

A Chinese commerce ministry official declined to answer questions about Trump.

The United States has a long list of grievances about China on trade, including accusations of steel dumping and theft of US intellectual property. Trump promised tough measures during his campaign last year but so far has not followed through.

Trump’s interest in penalizing Beijing has risen because of his concern at what he perceives to be Chinese inaction on reining in an increasingly belligerent North Korea, which is pursuing its missile and nuclear weapons programmes in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions.

Beijing has repeatedly said its influence on North Korea is limited and that it is doing all it can. Moreover, it argues trade between China and the United States benefits both sides and that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to improve their trade relationship.

"Maharashtra: Congress protests, seeks Housing Minister Prakash Mehta’s dismissal","Prakash Mehta Prakash Mehta

After demanding the resignation of Housing Minister Prakash Mehta during the ongoing monsoon session of the state legislature, the Congress upped the ante Saturday and undertook a march to the minister’s residence to seek his dismissal. The march was led by Mumbai Congress president Sanjay Nirupam, who along with party workers shouted slogans against Mehta outside his residence in suburban Ghatkopar.

“Mehta is an agent of builders. He needs to resign and leave his post. As housing minister, his responsibility is to provide homes to the poor under the SRA scheme. He has, however, fooled the people and has been involved in scam after scam,” said Nirupam.

The Congress members were subsequently detained by the police. Mehta faces allegations of sanctioning a controversial slum redevelopment project on the MP Mills compound in Tardeo without the chief minister’s consent and in violation of Development Control norms, providing a Rs 500-crore benefit to a private developer in the process. Fadnavis had later scrapped the project.

UN urges all countries to keep weapons from terrorist groups,"The country also faces “the world’s worst cholera outbreak in the midst of the world’s largest humanitarian crisis”, with the number of cases expected to reach 600,000 by the end of the year, the agency directors said. The country also faces “the world’s worst cholera outbreak in the midst of the world’s largest humanitarian crisis”, with the number of cases expected to reach 600,000 by the end of the year, the agency directors said.

The UN Security Council has unanimously adopted a resolution urging all countries to eliminate the supply of weapons to the Islamic State extremist group and other “terrorists” including by taking legal action against suppliers and marking arms to improve their traceability.

The resolution, sponsored by Egypt, strongly condemns the continuing flow of weapons, military equipment, drones and improvised explosive devices to IS, al-Qaida and their affiliates as well as illegal armed groups and criminals.

“This is one of the first resolutions aiming to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons,” Egypt’s UN Ambassador Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta, the current Security Council president, said after the vote yesterday.

“Arming of terrorists and terrorist groups … is a crime that is no less heinous than the terrorist act itself.”

The resolution reaffirms the commitment of all states to preventing weapons from reaching “terrorists.” It urges the UN’s 193 member states “to prevent and disrupt procurement networks for such weapons.” It also urges all countries “to act cooperatively to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons” including via the internet or social networks.

Yury Fedotov, executive director of the Vienna-based UN Office on Drugs and Crime, told the council by video link that “terrorists obtain weapons by many means, in all parts of the world, facilitated by access to poorly secured stockpiles, weak border management, the use of online platforms including hidden marketplaces, and diversion linked to poor transfer controls.”

Fedotov stressed the complex challenges to keep weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists, citing “inadequate regulatory environments and data collection, lack of specialised skills and equipment, and lack of coordination within and between countries and regions.”

Interpol Special Representative Emmanuel Roux told the council that although the use of weapons by terrorists isn’t new “today’s threat landscape is one of unprecedented complexity.”

“Convergence is the key word: between organised crime and terrorism; between old and new technologies; between military and law enforcement efforts,” he said.

Roux said Interpol is seeing firearms used in conflict zones reappearing on streets of major cities, commercial products that are legal turned into improvised explosive devices, and guns manufactured decades ago for sale on the dark web.

In parallel, he said foreigners who fight for terrorist groups may be exploiting their knowledge from the battlefield, the organised crime contacts and supply chains they used previously, “and technology allowing the creation of modular firearms and 3D printing, to access and use weapons.”

Roux said there are many “crucial actions” the international community can undertake including standardising end-user export controls, securely managing stockpiles, and strengthening and implementing strong national legislation.

Jehangir Khan, acting head of the new UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, said the diversion of weapons from government stockpiles, through theft or capturing depots, is an important source of arms for terrorist groups and others. And he said the illicit online weapons trade on the dark web is “particularly worrisome.”

US Ambassador Nikki Haley accused Iran of deliberately and systematically contributing “weapons, training and funding for terrorist groups” in violation of its international obligations.

“Terrorist proxies are doing the Iranian regime’s will in Iraq and in Syria,” she said. “Iran also supports Hamas and Bahraini terrorist groups. Through its partner Hezbollah, Iran is engaged in preparing for war in Lebanon. It is building an arsenal of weapons and battle-hardened troops.”

Pro Kabaddi 2017: Bengaluru Bulls taste first defeat of the season against UP Yoddha,"This is the first loss that Bengaluru Bulls have suffered this season . (Source: PKL) This is the first loss that Bengaluru Bulls have suffered this season . (Source: PKL)

Bengaluru Bulls must have felt somewhat like what they made the Tamil Thalaivas feel on Friday. They did not come as close to UP Yoddha on the scorecard as did the Thalaivas but it did look like Bengaluru may turn it around in the second half after trailing 18-8 in the first half. It was not to be and they lost the match 32-27.

The moment when the Bulls looked like having a chance in the match was when Rohit Kumar forced an all out and Super Raid. When he went to the opposition half of the mat, the score was 15-25 in favour of UP. Three players were remaining in the UP half and he managed to get a touch out of all three. He got a Super Raid and the all out got his team a further two points.

He went on to take three more points in the match to complete his Super 10. But Bengaluru’s defence was leaking points. Nitin Tomar took two points soon after that and restored UP’s eight-point lead. It was this that finally led to Bengaluru failing to catch up with UP.

This is the first loss that Bengaluru Bulls have suffered this season and it also makes it two wins out of two matches for UP Yoddhas. Nitin Tomar’s side now face Bengal Warriors on Friday. Bengaluru Bulls also play on the same day and they will be playing Patna Pirates, who are unbeaten in the two matches they have played so far.

"Ahead of Jaitley’s Kerala visit, CPI(M) stages demo over cadres’ killing","Union minister Arun Jaitley. (File) Union minister Arun Jaitley. (File)

Relatives of 21 persons, killed in political attacks over a period of time, began a ‘Satyagarha’ in front of the Raj Bhavan here this morning ahead of the visit of Union Minister Arun Jaitley to the house of an RSS activist murdered recently. The family members of the victims, who belonged to the CPI-M and killed in different parts of the state, are staging the dharna demanding that the Union minister visit their homes too and listen to their woes.

Annavoor Nagappan, Thiruvananthapuram District Secretary of CPI(M), which is organising the demonstration said the RSS and the BJP were indulging in “false propaganda” that the Marxist party heading the ruling LDF was indulging in violence. The slaying of RSS functionary Rajesh here on July 29 was not the handiwork of the CPI(M) as was being alleged, he told reporters here.

“We are deeply pained by his death,” he said.

Jaitley, who is a central minister, should also visit the houses of CPI(M)workers who have been killed in attacks, he added. Nagappan had also written an open letter to Jaitley on the alleged ‘double standards’ of the BJP on the issue of attacks. President of Eranholi Grama panchayat in Kannur, A K Remya has also written to Jaitley on the plight of her husband who is undergoing treatment since the past one month following an attack allegedly by RSS cadres.

Jaitley will be visiting the relatives of Rajesh besides the homes of councillors whose residences suffered damage in the recent violence involving rival party workers. An all party meeting called by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is also scheduled to be held this evening.

The state had been witnessing a cycle of violence involving BJP-RSS and CPI-M workers with the capital district rocked by incidents of attacks on houses of rival partymen in the past few days.

The state BJP office was vandalised on July 28. Governor P Sathasivam had summoned Vijayan and the state police chief over the law and order situation in the wake of the violence in the state.

Nepal PM Sher Bahadur Deuba to visit India from August 23: Report,"Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba

Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who took over from Maoist leader Prachanda in a power- sharing deal in June, will visit India on his first official trip overseas from August 23, a media report said on Wednesday. Deuba’s five-day state visit will come at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, The Kathmandu Post reported. The 71-year-old veteran Nepali politician known for his close ties to India took over the reigns of Nepal when the Himalayan nation was navigating a political turmoil over the implementation of the Constitution and unrest in the southern plains due to the Madhesi agitation.

Deuba had played a key role in bringing the Madhes-based parties on board for the second phase of the local-level polls held on June 28. His visit will come ahead of the third and final phase of the polls scheduled for September 18. Deuba’s visit will focus on implementing the past accords that were signed during his visits to India in 1996, 2002 and 2004 as prime minister.

“We have received two clear instructions from the prime minister,” two senior officials engaged in the preparations for the visit told the Post. “First, the prime minister is keen to implement the past agreements reached during his three visits to India. While dwelling on the status of the India-funded projects, the prime minister also plans to discuss the issues, if any, that have impeded the projects,” said a senior official.

“Second, the prime minister has told officials that there must be some concrete outcome from the visit,” the official told the daily. The Rs 30,000-crore bi-national Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project and other energy and infrastructure related projects are likely to be high on the agenda during Deuba’s visit.

The project aims to produce 5,000 MW of electricity. In 1996, Deuba and then Indian prime minister PV Narasimha Rao had held discussions on reviewing the 1950 Peace and Friendship Treaty and expediting the implementation of the Mahakali Treaty, including the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project and its financing model, Saptakoshi High Dam, Sunkoshi Diversion, Karnali Multipurpose Project and Budhi Gandaki Hydro Electricity Project, among others, the report said.

In 2002, India and Nepal had agreed for the early conclusion of the Agreement for Mutual Legal Assistance and updating the Extradition Treaty and construction of four Integrated Check-Posts along the Nepal-India border, it added. Both sides had called for a plan of action for the early commencement of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project. But a detailed project report is yet to be completed.

“Time has come for both sides to find out why there has not been desired progress on several understandings reached in the past,” the Post quoted Dinesh Bhattarai, foreign relations adviser to Deuba as saying. Deuba is likely to visit Bodh Gaya in Bihar and Tirupati Balaji Temple in Andhra Pradesh after concluding his engagements in New Delhi.

Maharashtra witnesses 94% of kharif sowing this season,"Maharashtra had till August 5 received only 77.1 per cent of its normal rainfall. (File Photo) Maharashtra had till August 5 received only 77.1 per cent of its normal rainfall. (File Photo)

Erratic rainfall over the past few weeks seems to have affected kharif sowing in the state. Maharashtra had till August 5 received only 77.1 per cent of its normal rainfall, which has led to kharif sowing taking place on 1.31 crore hectare, which is 94 per cent of the 1.39 crore hectares usually brought under crops in the kharif season. Last year, in the same period, sowing had taken place on nearly 97 per cent of land.

The sowing season had started early in the backdrop of considerable rains in June when Maharashtra received 98.1 per cent of its total rainfall for the month. However, rains seemed to have ebbed in July and August. In July, Maharashtra received only 71.8 per cent of the total July rainfall. In August, so far, it received less than adequate rainfall at 25.3 per cent. Till date, Maharashtra should have received 674.8 mm of rain. But the state has received 520.5 mm, which is 77.1 per cent of the normal rainfall.

Of Maharashtra’s 36 districts, 24 have received over 75 per cent of their share of rainfall. Twelve districts received between 50 and 75 per cent of their share. During kharif season, the area to be sown stands at 1.39 crore hectares in Maharashtra. Till August 1, a total of 1.31 crore hectares, which is 94 per cent of the total area, saw sowing.

Sowing has been the highest for cotton— 41.12 lakh hectares. Soyabean was the second highest with 37.04 lakh hectares, which is 16 per cent over the 31.92 lakh hectares average land on which it used to be grown.

Farmers have gone easy on sowing of tur where massive overproduction had caused a crisis last year. This year, it was sown on 12.39 lakh hectare as against 14.58 lakh hectares last year. The sowing this year had picked up early in spite of the farmers’ agitation that had created a political storm in Maharashtra.

"India vs Sri Lanka: Records continue to tumble, India become first visiting team to score more than 500 in two successive Tests in Island nation","India dominated proceedings on Day 2 as history was rewritten when several records were shattered. (Source: AP) India dominated proceedings on Day 2 as history was rewritten when several records were shattered. (Source: AP)

Much like the first day of the second Test between India and Sri Lanka, day two witnessed history being rewritten as several records were shattered and new ones came up to take their place. On a day when the visitors dominated proceedings, what stood out were the twin tons by Cheteshwar Pujara and some power hitting from the likes of Wriddhiman Saha and Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammad Shami. Courtesy of which the Indian team recorded the eighth occasions when a team scored more than 600 runs in successive Tests. However, that was not all as more numbers were rewritten. Herein we bring you a few of them.

Apart from scoring more than 600 runs in successive Tests India also became the first visiting team to post 500+ in two successive Tests in Sri Lanka. They did it first in Galle and now at the SSC.

This is also the second instance when a cricket team has scored more than 600 four times in a year. Also the first time in a Test match in Sri Lanka, six batsmen ended up scoring more than 50 in India’s innings.

Among individual achievements, R Ashwin achieved yet another milestone. when he became the fourth fastest to achieve the double of 2000 runs & 200 wickets.

At the end of second day’s play, Sri Lanka stood at 50/2 after India declared their innings after recording a mammoth 622 for the loss of 9 wickets.

Add science to taste,"Within the older IITs, we see excessive coaching, diversion of talent away from core sectors, and dropping quality of Ph.D applicants. Within the older IITs, we see excessive coaching, diversion of talent away from core sectors, and dropping quality of Ph.D applicants.

The best way to ensure science will influence policy is to encourage people to appreciate and engage with science. That can only happen through education, communication, and ties of mutual respect between scientists and their communities — the paths of communication must go both ways. There has too long been a divide between the scientific community and the public. We encourage scientists to reach out to their communities, sharing their research and its impact on people’s everyday lives. We encourage them, in turn, to listen to communities and consider their research and future plans from the perspective of the people they serve. We must take science out of the labs and journals and share it with the world.” (Concluding paragraph of the Mission statement of The March For Science movement.)

IISc, the IITs, IISERs are some of the most eminent institutions in India and are headed by distinguished academicians, scientists and administrators. The conduct of science and technology (S&T) in the country is directly and indirectly influenced by the methods, topics of research and notions of rigour that these institutions practise.

Yet all is not well within Indian S&T. We see a great disconnect between the centrally funded institutions, the state universities and ground reality.

Within the older IITs, we see excessive coaching, diversion of talent away from core sectors, and dropping quality of Ph.D applicants. In the sciences, we see a narrow focus on academic research with little relevance, an over-supply of post-graduates and few openings other than in academics. We also see the newly started IITs and IISERs groping for definition and fighting for the same pool of central funding. The so-called placement problem is acute for these new institutions, specially the IISERs, where there are few pathways for gainful employment for students who do not want to pursue a Ph.D.

On the other hand, we also have the development agenda of sadak, bijli, paani, and other material needs of a young and impatient population. We see age-old practices of delivery, based on outdated knowledge and a governance which is failing. We also have small, household and rural enterprises, who are our largest employers, struggling in the market place.

An important cause is the absence of the above agenda in our curricula, research and modes of engagement. We have not recognised these sectors as essentially engineering and scientific services, but which require an inter-disciplinary and field-oriented methodology within a regional context. We have also failed to formalise these sectors so as to bring out the key processes and problems, ways of measurement, agents and their protocols, in other words, opening them up for analysis and improving outcomes. If we had done this, perhaps today we would have the necessary empirics, gadgets and processes to create new job definitions and professions, which bring efficiency and deliver value and pay for themselves. Examples of such positions are District Drinking Water Analyst, or District Public Transport Manager, or Cooking Energy Auditor, the City Economist, or even Scientific Advisor to the District Collector.

Engagement with the development agenda has always been part of research and training within universities in the West. It was only in 1958 that the MIT dismantled the Department of Sanitation Engineering. See, for example, the Transportation Center at the University of Toronto or the inter-disciplinary Twente Water Center. Today, various top universities are redefining engineering education, for instance, “Engineering+X” at University of Southern California, or Development Engineering at UC Berkeley, and other innovative UG programmes at several universities.

Our proposal is to initiate the formalisation of the development agenda and reclaim it as an area of interest for the science and technology establishment. It is to assert that these areas are indeed amenable to scientific rigour and rational argument in broader society. This is to be achieved by our network of centrally funded institutions adopting certain key measures. Perhaps, we can begin with the IITs, NITs, IISERs and the centrally funded universities.

One, each department is to identify 2-3 development sectors for deeper engagement and study. Civil Engg. at IIT Bombay may choose drinking water, Mechanical Engg. at IIT Mandi may choose wood-burning stoves for the hills, Chemistry at IISER-Pune may choose regional water quality assessment and analysis, and Economics at IIT Kanpur or Delhi University may study district plans.

Two, in these areas, the departments will identify a team of faculty members to develop expertise through field-work, inter-disciplinary training, student-based projects and case-studies and engage with local, regional and state agencies. This will be supported by laboratories, testing facilities and staff. This should eventually lead to key reports and publications which contribute to better practices in the sector.

Three, upon maturing, these development sectors should lead to course material and research frameworks. These should be extended to regional colleges. Four, the collection of institutions will evolve common frameworks for academics and institutional mechanisms of working in inter-disciplinary areas. They will also work out common funding, faculty incentives and possibly chair positions to give prestige to the programme.

Such a programme will be widely appreciated both outside and inside higher education, in political, social and intellectual circles and also by our alumni. It will be seen as a positive step to broaden and deepen science and technology and strengthen our role in it, and also to provide jobs in the form of new professions. It will be welcomed by regional institutions for they will see a role for themselves and an outlet for their creative energies. It will provide much needed support to state agencies who work in very adverse conditions. Finally, it will infuse new blood into research by bringing new methods, problems and a much-needed focus on sustainability.

Perhaps such a decentralisation of S&T may redefine school-level science as broad enough to incorporate the immediate environment as worthy of study, documentation and analysis. It will cause a deepening of scientific temper which will help people negotiate for themselves a better deal in the market and society. Finally, it will show that modern science has a method and outcomes that are not limited to passing entrance exams or publishing papers.

The IISc, IITs and IISERs are well poised for a leadership role in this exciting mission. The massive dissatisfaction over development outcomes will eventually force us to adopt at least some part of the development agenda. It is better that we do this on our own terms and preserve our autonomy and our notion of rigour. While we may argue about the “traditional” and the “ancient”, the “modern” must ultimately deliver material outcomes.

The world of science too is groping for ideas and mechanisms to re-engage with the community and re-establish its credentials as a pillar of freedom, prosperity and sustainability.

Donald Trump will no longer tolerate any support to militants: H R McMaster,"US President Donald Trump (AP Photo) US President Donald Trump (AP Photo)

Asserting that President Donald Trump will no longer “tolerate” any support to militants, US National Security Adviser Gen H R McMaster today asked Pakistan to change its “paradoxical” policy of supporting selective terror groups. US officials have often accused Pakistan of helping the militants, a charge Islamabad denies. “The president has also made clear that he, that we need to see a change in– in behaviour of those in the region, which includes– those who are providing safe haven and support bases for the Taliban, Haqqani Network and others,” the National Security Advisor, McMaster, was quoted by MSNBC as saying.

“This is Pakistan in particular that we want to– that we want to really see a change in and a reduction of their support for these groups,” he said, in response to a question on Afghanistan and terrorism in the region. He said that Trump is making clear that the US will no longer “tolerate” any support for the Taliban or related groups.

“Of course, you know, a very paradoxical situation, right, where Pakistan is taking great losses. They have fought very hard against these groups, but they’ve done so really only selectively,” he said. Pakistan’s two neighbours — both India and Afghanistan – have accused it of being selective in its war against terrorism.

McMaster said that Trump has lifted restrictions on US armed forces in Afghanistan. He also defended Trump’s strategy on winning the war in Afghanistan by giving unrestricted powers to the US military based in the war-torn country. “The president has said that, “He does not want to place restrictions on the military that undermine our ability to win battles in combat”.

“He has lifted those restrictions, and you are beginning to see the payoff of that as well,” the top US national security advisor said.

Elaine Thompson easily into 100 metres semi-finals,"Elaine Thompson after women’s 100-meter heat during the World Athletics Championships. (Source: AP) Elaine Thompson after women’s 100-meter heat during the World Athletics Championships. (Source: AP)

Olympic champion Elaine Thompson ignored a cloudburst to easily win her opening heat in the women’s 100 metres at the World Championships on Saturday.

The Jamaican could afford to ease up near the line as she finished in 11.05 seconds while her main rivals also comfortably survived the first stage in front of a crowd of over 50,000.

American Tori Bowie, silver medallist behind Thompson in Rio last year, won her heat in exactly the same time.

Dafne Schippers, who unlike Thompson will run in both the 100 and 200 metres, started her bid for a double by finishing second in her heat in 11.08 seconds behind Ivorian Marie-Josee Ta Lou, still good enough to qualify comfortably.

Gina Lueckenkemper produced the most impressive performance as she won the first heat in a personal of best of 10.95 seconds, becoming the first German to break 11 seconds since Katrin Krabbe at the 1991 World Championships.

“It was amazing and I am absolutely speechless after that race,” said the 20-year-old. “It was a dream to run sub-11 inside this stadium at these championships. This just feels so, so good.”

It was a mixed day for Germany, however, as her compatriot Tatjana Pinto false-started in her heat and become the only athlete to be disqualified.

Britain’s Desiree Henry, who as a 16-year-old was one of the torchbearers at the London Olympics five years ago, also qualified after finishing fourth in her heat.

Discovery of India,"Photograph by Anushree Fadnavis Photograph by Anushree Fadnavis

In one photograph, Anita, a transgender, strikes a model-like pose in a black sari at the door of the women’s compartment of a Mumbai local. Adorning her back is the tattoo of an angel, which she believes protects her at all times. In another frame, a woman channels her inner leopard — if her appearance is anything to go by. She is dressed in a top and a scarf printed with the spots of the wild cat.

These photographs, shot by 29-year-old photojournalist Anushree Fadnavis on her mobile phone since 2013, reveal a deep fascination with the ladies compartment of Mumbai’s local trains. Part of her series Train Diaries, which is a hit on Instagram, these photographs form her exhibition, “A Million Mutinies Later – India at 70”, at Ffotogallery’s Turner House Gallery and The Angel, in Cardiff, Wales. The exhibition is on till July 22.

“A lot of women use their time during their commute on the train very creatively and almost become like a second family after getting to know each other. They knit, do crochet, cut vegetables, apply henna on their their hands, and even get dressed here. In the men’s compartment, conversations are about work. In the women’s cabin, the chitter chatter is fuelled by emotions. Many a times, I have cried, become angry and let go of a lot of emotions in the women’s compartment,” says Fadnavis.

Held in partnership with the Nazar Foundation/Delhi Photo Festival for UK-India Year of Culture 2017, the exhibition offers a bird’s eye view of India since Independence. Nineteen artists, including Bharat Sikka, Javed Iqbal and Arko Datto, have investigated the everyday revolutions that have transformed the social, cultural and political fabric of the nation through their lens-based art, such as photographs, films and videos. “Looking at the last 70 years, the economic liberalisation of India has brought a range of changes. We wanted to explore the different themes of representing India, which is very dynamic. Usually, one looks at a revolution to define a nation. We were looking at the million small revolutions taking place across the country, whether in the community, nation or its people,” says Anshika Varma, one of the curators.

Through street photography, Delhi-based photographer Monica Tiwari has documented the rise of Gurgaon, its urbanised setting surrounded by the remnants of its rural past. A group of Haryanvi women, with faces hidden under their pallu, are seen dancing to musical beats. “She has ended up documenting a space that is at that moment of transition. It is not a village or a town and is on its way of becoming an urban city,” says Varma. A line of cows stands tall before one of Gurgaon’s enormous glass skyscrapers, which are a storehouse for the MNC offices mushrooming within its commercial hub, Cyber City. “Revolution happens in many forms, it is not merely shouting ‘Inquilab Zindabad’. It might mean migrating from smaller places like villages to cities. That itself is a revolution, where one goes ahead and explores the horizons, and migration is a sign that things are changing. This ambition that has come is representative of India’s youth,” she adds.

Artist duo Yashaswini B Raghunandan and Ekta Mittal’s project “Behind the Tin Sheets”, comprises three films on the migration of labourers from across the country to Bangalore for the metro construction. Sikka’s series Matter offers a contemplative look through the landscape view of a mountain terrain enveloped in snow, reminiscent of the Himalayas, shots of a horse with trees behind and of a bandbajawallah, alongside the close-up of a CD. “He looks at the transition and change all over the world and how we come from the same matter. You can go from landscape to people to cosmos but it will still remain matter,” says Varma.

San Francisco airport officials say a teenage boy opened the emergency door of a plane that had just landed and jumped onto the tarmac. Airport spokesman Doug Yakel says an airfield construction crew confronted the 17-year-old boy, who has been arrested and is in police custody.

He says Copa Airlines Flight 208 from Panama City landed on Tuesday afternoon and was waiting to head to a gate when the teenager, who appeared to be in emotional distress, jumped from the aircraft.

Yakel says the teenager is a US citizen and was traveling alone.

He says no runways or flights were affected and that the unidentified boy wasn’t injured. Yakel says the plane went to its assigned gate and all passengers got off the flight without incident.

Christopher Wray on Thursday was sworn in as the new FBI Director, succeeding James Comey who was fired unceremoniously by President Donald Trump. Wray, 50, previously worked as the US Assistant Attorney for the Criminal Division. He was sworn in by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. On Wednesday, his appointment was confirmed by the US Senate which voted 92-5 in his favour.

“It is the honour of a lifetime to serve as Director. I long ago grew to know and admire the FBI from my earliest days as a line prosecutor to my years as assistant attorney general,” Wray said in a statement after being sworn in.

“I am excited, humbled and grateful, therefore, to have this chance to work side-by-side again with these fine professionals for the good of the country and the cause of justice,” he said.

In a statement, Sessions praised Wray’s “spirit” and “strength of character,” saying: “I am confident that the FBI, the premier investigative agency in the world, is in great hands with Director Chris Wray at the helm.”

“I congratulate him for being overwhelmingly confirmed to that post and look forward to working with him every day to keep America safe,” he said.

As a former federal prosecutor and head of the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, Wray has successfully prosecuted terrorists, drug kingpins, and white-collar criminals, Sessions said.

FBI directors are approved by the Senate to serve for 10 years, but the president has unilateral authority to fire them at any time.

"Wembley test for Chelsea, Arsenal after tough off-season","Alexis Sanchez may decide his future lies away from north London despite efforts from Arsene Wenger to hold onto him. (Source: AP File) Alexis Sanchez may decide his future lies away from north London despite efforts from Arsene Wenger to hold onto him. (Source: AP File)

When Chelsea faces Arsenal in the Community Shield on Sunday, the winner may be which team can best put a turbulent off-season behind them. The traditional season curtain raiser at Wembley Stadium features league champion Chelsea against FA Cup winner Arsenal.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been trying to keep hold of Alexis Sanchez as the Gunners attempt to return to the Champions League after missing out on qualification for the first time in 20 years. Chelsea boss Antonio Conte is desperate to increase the size of his “small squad” as the Blues prepare to defend its Premier League title.

“The strength of professional people is to not be diverted by noises that are not their problem,” Wenger said Thursday.

There’s a lot of noise. Sanchez was Arsenal’s leading scorer with 30 goals last season, including the opener in its FA Cup final triumph over Chelsea at Wembley in May. He appears to have decided his future lies away from north London but Wenger disagrees.

“He is focused. My decision is clear, he will stay and he will respect that and that’s as simple as that,” Wenger said of the Chile forward.

Despite signing France striker Alexandre Lacazette from Lyon in July for a club record 60 million euros (then $68 million), Arsenal has chosen to keep Sanchez for the final year of his contract. That risks the possibility of losing the 28-year-old star on a free transfer at the end of the season.

Conte won the title in his first season at Stamford Bridge with a squad lacking depth, but wants multiple new faces to cope with the additional strain of Champions League football.

“Now, for us, it’s very important to try to improve our squad’s numerical aspect, because we have a small squad and I think only one player is not enough to improve our team,” Conte said on Friday.

Chelsea has signed striker Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid, midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco and defender Antonio Rudiger from Roma during the offseason, but those arrivals have been offset by the departures of Nemanja Matic and John Terry. Also, Diego Costa is no longer wanted by Conte.

There have been reports of unrest between Conte and the Chelsea hierarchy over transfer policy, which were further fueled in July when the former Italy manager received a salary increase but did not extend his contract, which expires in 2019.

“The most important thing is the club knows my opinion and they’re trying to do the best for our team, our squad,” Conte said. “Now we have to wait, we must have patience.”

Past Community Shield matches have often lacked genuine competitiveness, but the shared summer of discontent and a fierce London rivalry should guarantee entertainment on Sunday.

“I think friendly games have ended for us,” Conte said. “This is an official game, this is the first trophy in the season.”

"Mercosur suspends Venezuela, urges immediate transition","FILE PHOTO: Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro talks to the media during a news conference at Miraflores Palace in Caracas, Venezuela, June 22, 2017.

(REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo)

South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela indefinitely on Saturday, adding to international pressure on President Nicolas Maduro to dismantle a newly created pro-government constituent assembly and restore democracy. Foreign ministers of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil announced the decision in Sao Paulo, urging Maduro to release prisoners and immediately start a political transition.

“We are saying: Stop with this! Enough with the deaths, enough with the repression. It is not possible to inflict such torture on the people,” Brazilian Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes said after the meeting. As the suspension was announced, the constituent assembly removed dissident state prosecutor Luisa Ortega from her job. Asked to comment on Ortega’s dismissal, Nunes replied with a Latin proverb: “Whom the gods would destroy they first drive mad.”

Mercosur has no provision for expulsion. It had suspended Venezuela temporarily in December for not complying with the bloc’s regulations, and toughened its stance following the controversial election of the constituent assembly on Sunday and the arrest of several opposition leaders. Countries around the world have condemned the vote, calling it a bid to extend Maduro’s rule indefinitely. Argentina’s Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie labeled Venezuela a dictatorship.

“It is very bad to push a brother out of the door, but it did so with conviction because we are watching a situation that causes us great pain,” Faurie said. Although Venezuela sits on the world’s largest-known oil reserves, millions are suffering food shortages and soaring inflation. Months of anti-government unrest have killed more than 120 people.

The suspension will not affect trade and migration policies to avoid worsening the humanitarian crisis, Nunes said. “Venezuelans who want to come to Brazil will be welcome.”

Delhi Police Saturday arrested a man for allegedly kidnapping and raping a 13-year-old girl from Rohini. Police claimed the accused had confessed to taking the girl to Jammu, where he allegedly raped her.

According to police, the accused, Vishal alias Happy, lives in Rohini with his wife. Police said the girl is a student at a private school, and went missing from outside her home in Rohini on July 31. The incident was caught on CCTV, which showed two persons kidnapping the girl. Her family approached police and a case was registered.

Police started probing Vishal’s role as the girl’s family pointed them in his direction. “Police came to know that he had gone to Jammu. A team was sent to there, and they came to know that he had arrived with a girl and booked a hotel room. But he had left for Delhi by the time the team reached,” a senior officer said, adding that he was eventually traced to Delhi’s Pankha Road.

Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar predicts 100 per cent literacy in India by 2022,"The target of 100 per cent literacy, the minister said, would be achieved in part by training school students to teach their illiterate parents and grandparents. The target of 100 per cent literacy, the minister said, would be achieved in part by training school students to teach their illiterate parents and grandparents.

Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday predicted that India would achieve 100 per cent literacy over the next five years and hoped that public and private schools would compete with each other in the new India. Javadekar was delivering the inaugural address at the Rajasthan government’s first Festival of Education, held in partnership with Dubai-based GEMS Education group. At Independence, the literacy rate was just 18 per cent, which now stood at 80 per cent, he said.

The target of 100 per cent literacy, the minister said, would be achieved in part by training school students to teach their illiterate parents and grandparents. Javadekar emphasised on making learning more enjoyable in order to check dropouts. He lauded the improvements made by the Rajasthan government in school education, especially the increasing competitiveness of the government schools.

He said the government’s efforts towards improving the quality of education in state-run schools would lead to an environment of healthy competition between these schools and private ones. Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, UAE’s minister of culture, education and youth affairs, said in his keynote address that education led to innovation, which helped in a nation’s development. CM Vasundhara Raje and School Education Minister Vasudev Devnani were also present on the occasion.

"Amir Khan, wife Faryal Makhdoom involved in ugly spat on Twitter","Amir Khan and Faryal Makhdoom were in India recently to promote Super Boxing League. (Source: Twitter) Amir Khan and Faryal Makhdoom were in India recently to promote Super Boxing League. (Source: Twitter)

Amir Khan and his wife Faryal Makhdoom have been making their private affairs pretty public in the recent weeks. First it was Makhdoom accusing the British boxer’s family of “bulling” her in a series of Snapchat posts. And now it appears that the duo have decided to split following tweets from his account which said, ““So me and the wife Faryal have agreed to split. I’m currently in Dubai. Wish her all the best.” But that was not the end of it. The two shared more intimate information into their lives with Amir accusing Makhdoom of cheating on him with fellow-boxer Anthony Joshua.

At first many suspected that Amir’s account may have been hacked but Makhdoom hit right back with stinging responses of her own to make it uglier than what it already was. She branded her husband of four years a cheat and a liar in her strong response. The two have a three-year-old daughter Lamaisah. To make things even more bizarre, the couple had been pictured just five days back at an ice bar in Dubai.

In one of the tweets, Amir shared a screenshot of an alleged conversation between Makhdoom and Joshua which took place on Snapchat. He also made it clear that the two were now splitting while accusing her of being a “gold digger”.

So me and the wife Faryal have agreed to split. I'm currently in Dubai. Wish her all the best. — Amir Khan (@amirkingkhan) August 4, 2017

Faryal moved on quick. Always mentioned to me how much she wanted to be with another guy, from all people another boxer 🙄 @anthonyfjoshua pic.twitter.com/1GBAQnvzMC — Amir Khan (@amirkingkhan) August 4, 2017

Lol moved up in the weight classes lol. Trust me I ain't the jealous type. No need to send me pictures of the men your talking to #disgusted — Amir Khan (@amirkingkhan) August 4, 2017

Left my family and friends for this Faryal. I'm not hurt but another fighter. I'm making it public. You getting the divorce #Golddigger — Amir Khan (@amirkingkhan) August 4, 2017

Mans like Joshua can have my left overs! — Amir Khan (@amirkingkhan) August 4, 2017

Throughout the tirade, Faryal remained quiet but as soon as the flurry of tweets stopped, came her rebuttal and a strong one at that. The first read: “I’m not sure if it’s your family tweeting for you. But I’m not the one who been [sic] in the papers for cheating”. Her next one accused Amir of “making false things up” while re-igniting the family feud with a claim they had “robbed” him.

Not done yet, she replied to accusation of cheating on him with Joshua. “Accusing other boxers just because your boxing career is finished. Man up amir,” she added.

@amirkingkhan I'm not sure if it's your family tweeting for you. But I'm not the one who been in the papers for cheating 😂 — Faryal Makhdoom Khan (@FaryalxMakhdoom) August 4, 2017

@amirkingkhan p.s I'm not the one who's been in the papers for cheating 😂 — Faryal Makhdoom Khan (@FaryalxMakhdoom) August 4, 2017

The majority of the tweets in this tirade have since been deleted but not before many took screenshots of them. Amir had got engaged to American model Faryal in 2012 when she was 20 and he 26.

"‘Tannie Ans’, the great-grandma turned supercoach for Wayde van Niekerk","Van Niekerk says he teases his Namibian mentor for her stubborn ways. (Source: Reuters) Van Niekerk says he teases his Namibian mentor for her stubborn ways. (Source: Reuters)

Ans Botha’s transformation from one minute being a 75-year-old cooing over her 10-month-old great grandson to the next playing ‘supercoach’ to the greatest new talent in athletics is one of sport’s more extraordinary makeovers.

Yet as Wayde Van Niekerk runs the 400 metres heats at the World Athletics Championships in London on Saturday, eyeing more athletics landmarks, he would not want anyone but this “amazing woman” to be guiding him.

Botha has three children, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. “Oh yes, I’m a great-grandmother — but not of Wayde!” she laughs, when asked how they gel with their 50-year age gap.

South African Van Niekerk says he teases his Namibian mentor for her stubborn ways and Botha gives him old-fashioned looks about his blaring music. “She’s strict,” smiles Van Niekerk, yet, clearly, their relationship comes with deep affection, trust and respect.

It has worked famously in the five years since Van Niekerk enrolled at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein and asked to join the training group of Botha, their athletics coach of 25 years.

Under her tutelage, not only has he become a world record breaker and Olympic champion at 400 metres, clocking 43.03 seconds in Rio last year, but also the only man ever to break 10 seconds for 100m, 20secs for 200m and 44secs for 400m.

In London, he could become the first man since Michael Johnson in 1995 to achieve the 200m/400m double at the world championships.

Botha smiles that, actually, like the rest of her training group, she cannot help but see Van Niekerk like one of her “children”. From schoolchildren to veterans, they all call her ‘Tannie Ans’ — Auntie Ans in Afrikaans.

“There are 32 of them and I treat them the same. They’re an exceptional group of children,” she said in an interview with Reuters.

“Wayde really loves to be in the group because they’re like a family. When he has to train on his own, he always complains ‘Tannie, I’m alone, I want my friends, my other athletes here with me.'”

Van Niekerk’s dramatic rise over the past year has proved a real culture shock for Botha, finding herself at the centre of a media fuss.

After a fifty-year self-taught coaching career which began back in Namibia when she couldn’t find a coach for her daughter Herma, Botha, once a long jumper and sprinter herself, said: “In a way, it’s a really difficult experience for me at 75.

“In another way, I’m still the same person, still a great grandmother who loves gardening and all my other activities. So it’s not made any difference to me as a human being.

“It is physically demanding at my age but I enjoy it. I’m walking a lot and then stretching. I’ve found when you have the enthusiasm and the love and passion for something, it’s no big issue.

“I’m just so blessed and am so grateful to do the things I love at my time of life.”

Van Niekerk feels blessed to have her guiding him too.

“She’s an amazing woman,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “I don’t think she’s as scary as some people think but she is a tough lady.

“She’s fixed in a lot of her ways but if you approach her with love and respect, then you can win her heart quite easily.

“Once you step on the wrong side then you can find it’s quite difficult to win her over. I haven’t stepped over that mark, but I do like to tease her which she is not used to.”

The ageless Botha loves guiding Van Niekerk, but what does she prefer — being the perfect coach or the perfect great grandma?

“I think it’s both. When I have the opportunity to be with my family, I try to make it really, really quality time,” she smiled, before adding with a glint in her eyes: “Yet when I’m busy coaching, I have a one-track mind.”

Mumbai University results: Chief Minister assures probe if results not declared before Aug 16,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis

The delay in the Mumbai University results has again rocked the Assembly on August 3 with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis assuring the state legislative council that he would investigate whether the pending results could not be declared before August 16.

He was responding to a Congress member’s information that the MU Vice Chancellor Sanjay Deshmukh himself has told his party delegation that results could not be declared before August 16.

The opposition parties alleged that Fadnavis was being misled by the VC over the declaration of results. Raising the issue in the upper house, senior NCP member Sunil Tatkare said the prevailing mess and delay in declaration of results was due to the VC’s “ignorance” and he should therefore, be asked to resign.

“The government should also tell the students about what went wrong with the assessment process and help those, who wish to go abroad for further studies. Their future has become uncertain because of the VC,” Tatkare said.

Participating in the debate, Congress member Sanjay Dutt said that although the chief minister as well as the state education minister had assured the House earlier that all the pending results would be out by August 5, the VC has himself admitted that completion of assessment was not possible before August 16.

“A Congress delegation led by (city Congress chief) Sanjay Nirupam met the VC yesterday and he himself admitted that all the pending results cannot be declared before August 16. The VC has misled the CM and the education minister,” he said.

In his reply, Fadnavis said that the information provided by Dutt was new to him and he would investigate it. “Results are coming out everyday and I am getting a status report as well. However, the information provided today is new to me and I will investigate it,” Fadnavis said.

“The Governor is the appointing authority for the VC and he has taken up the matter seriously and probing it. The governor will ensure action against whoever is guilty,” the chief minister added. Last week, the Maharashtra government had ordered an inquiry against Deshmukh over his role in implementing the new online assessment system, which has resulted in a delay in declaration of examination results.

Minister of State for Higher Education Ravindra Waikar earlier told the state assembly that an inquiry would be initiated against Deshmukh about the manner in which the new assessment system was implemented.

US Vice President Pence’s hawkish tone on Russia contrasts with Trump approach,"FILE PHOTO – US President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence attend a National Day of Prayer event at the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, US on May 4, 2017. (REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo) FILE PHOTO – US President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence attend a National Day of Prayer event at the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, US on May 4, 2017. (REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo)

When President Donald Trump scolded US lawmakers on Thursday for clamping down on Moscow with new sanctions, his message clashed with the one that Vice President Mike Pence pushed during a four-day trip this week to Eastern Europe. As he toured Estonia, Georgia and Montenegro, Pence said the sanctions passed overwhelmingly by Congress would send a unified message to Russia that it must change its behavior.

Trump, by contrast, took to Twitter to complain that the sanctions legislation, which he grudgingly signed, would send US-Russia relations to “an all-time & very dangerous low.” While some Republicans played down the divergence, critics said it exemplified an incoherent policy that would unsettle allies and fail to placate Moscow.

“There are some policies where a good cop/bad approach can work,” said Michael McFaul, a US ambassador to Russia under former Democratic President Barack Obama. But McFaul added that in the case of the Trump administration’s policy toward Russia, Moscow was likely to view the mixed signals as a sign of policy disarray. If Trump continues to want improved relations with Russia, “he’s not achieving his goal,” McFaul said.

The Republican president has repeatedly said he wants better ties with Russia. But the country has loomed large over the first six months of his administration as a special counsel and US congressional panels investigate allegations Moscow meddled in the 2016 US election to help Trump and also examine any potential role by Trump aides. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign.

After Congress passed the sanctions legislation with a large enough margin to override a presidential veto, Trump signed it on Wednesday but criticized it as infringing on his authority and said he could make “far better deals” with governments than Congress could. As a countermeasure to the sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for reducing the staff of the US diplomatic mission by 755 people and for the seizure of two properties near Moscow used by American diplomats.

‘SMALL AND BULLYING LEADER’

Jarrod Agen, deputy chief of staff to Pence, insisted that Trump and Pence were “completely aligned” on Russia. “It was the president’s decision to send the vice president to the region. It was the president’s decision to deliver the message that the vice president delivered,” Agen told Reuters.

He added that Pence and Trump spoke every day during his trip and sometimes multiple times a day. The disconnect between Pence and Trump on Russia is an anomaly. Pence usually goes to lengths to emphasize his loyalty to his boss and to downplay any differences.

Their different tone on Russia dates back to the US presidential campaign. While Trump often praised Putin, Pence called the Russian president a “small and bullying leader” during a vice presidential debate last October. During his trip this week, Pence condemned Russia for its “occupation of Georgia’s soil” as he spoke to US and Georgian troops engaged in joint exercises only 40 miles (64 km) away from Russian troops in South Ossetia.

In Montenegro, Pence accused Russia of trying to “destabilize” the western Balkans – a message criticized by Moscow. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it was “regrettable to note that Washington is sliding ever deeper into the primitive ideology of the Cold War era, which is completely detached from reality.”

Traditional Republican conservatives – who favor a hard line on Moscow – have taken some comfort in Pence’s message, as have foreign leaders concerned about the impact of a rapprochement between Trump and Putin. “What he (Pence) is saying is good and helpful and should be the policy of the Trump administration – and so for those of us who want it to be that way, we’re happy to embrace it,” said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

“None of us know what Donald Trump thinks in his heart of hearts about Russia,” Pletka said. But she added: “If (Trump) were not comfortable with Pence making this trip, Pence would not be making this trip.” Republican Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would not “read a lot” into the different tones struck by Pence and Trump, although he welcomed Pence’s trip to the European countries.

Corker described Pence as the administration’s “ombudsman” on policy and said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, were key to developing Trump’s foreign policy. A former US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was at pains to explain the disconnect between Pence and Trump on Russia. “We are dealing with a major, open split between the president and basically the rest of his administration with the possible exception of Tillerson,” the former official said.

Philippines’ Duterte signs law granting free public college,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (REUTERS/Ezra Acayan/File Photo) Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (REUTERS/Ezra Acayan/File Photo)

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has signed a law granting tuition-free education in all state universities, a Cabinet official said on Friday, setting aside the advice of his economic managers to reject the measure. The president believed the benefits of the law outweighed the potential short-term budgetary challenges, Menardo Guevarra, senior deputy executive secretary, told a media conference.

Duterte’s economic managers have said the government would not be able to afford the cost of free-tuition, estimated at 100 billion pesos ($2 billion) a year. They also said tuition-free education at state universities and colleges (SUCs) would not benefit the poor because only 12 percent of students in SUCs belong to low-income families. “Free tertiary education in SUCs (state universities and colleges) is a very strong pillar or cornerstone of the president’s social development policy,” Guevarra said.

Senator Franklin Drilon has said the measure would only require 20-25 billion pesos a year, much less than the economic managers’ estimate.

The Duterte administration has planned a whopping $180 billion infrastructure spending until the end of the president’s term in 2022. To fund that, the government has asked lawmakers to pass new revenue measures. Duterte’s economic programme focuses on infrastructure spending and fiscal efficiency to lift growth to as much as 8 percent before his six-year term ends in 2022. ($1 = 50.2100 Philippine pesos)

"GST to push up Pune, Nagpur metro project cost","The Nagpur Metro is being built at a cost of Rs 8,680 crore. The Nagpur Metro is being built at a cost of Rs 8,680 crore.

The new GST regime will increase the project cost of Nagpur as well as Pune metros by about five per cent. It was disclosed by Mahametro Managing Director Brijesh Dixit during a special visit to The Indian Express office here on Friday.

Dixit was replying to a question about the effect of GST on Metro work. “It is expected to increase the overall cost of the project by about 5 per cent,” Dixit, who is in charge of both Nagpur and Pune metro projects, said. The escalation is owing to tax on construction material going up, according to Dixit.

The Nagpur Metro is being built at a cost of Rs 8,680 crore while the Pune project was originally expected to cost Rs 11,420 crore. The GST will lead to the Nagpur project cost going up by about Rs 400 crore while Pune project will rise by about Rs 500 crore. Nagpur Metro project’s work has been completed up to about 40 pc, according to Dixit.

The Metro’s section of about 5.5 km from the originating Khapri station to Nagpur airport is slated for a trial run this month. Three coaches have already arrived in the city for the inaugural run.

Supermarket chain Aldi stops selling eggs in Germany over food safety scare,"Eggs are pictured in this illustration photo in Bad Honnef, Germany, August 4, 2017.

Discount supermarket chain Aldi is withdrawing all eggs from sale at its more than 4,000 stores in Germany as a precaution, it said on Friday, as a scare over the possible contamination of eggs with insecticide spreads. Traces of insecticide fipronil were found in eggs in Belgium and the Netherlands last month, which has led to the temporary shut-down of some poultry farms and to supermarkets halting the sale of eggs from the Netherlands.

Fipronil is considered by the World Health Organization to be moderately toxic, with high doses leading to feelings of nausea and dizziness. Very large quantities can cause damage to the kidneys, liver and lymph glands. German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt said the likelihood of a health hazard was very unlikely, but German state authorities were working to examine all egg supplies and determine where they originated or were processed.

“The situation is under control, but we cannot give the all-clear signal yet … We are taking this very seriously,” Schmidt told the Straubinger Tagblatt/Landshuter Zeitung newspaper group. He urged consumers to check any already purchased eggs against lists of affected supplies that were available online. Investigators suspect the chemical may have gotten into eggs through a contaminated detergent against mites called Dega 16 that is used to clean barns, and criminal investigations have been launched in both Belgium and the Netherlands.

The Netherlands is the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter after the United States and sells around 5 billion eggs a year to Germany. The detergent was also supplied to farms in the northern German state of Lower Saxony, from where eggs were distributed across the country, Lower Saxony’s agriculture ministry said.

Dutch food safety watchdog NVWA said this week only a limited type of egg, recognizable by specific serial numbers, posed a risk. Nonetheless, around 180 poultry companies in the Netherlands have been temporarily closed, and some firms have culled their flock.

A number of supermarket chains including Germany’s REWE and Penny have taken Dutch eggs off their shelves. Aldi is the first major retailer to halt all egg sales, regardless of origin. “This is merely a precaution, there is no reason to assume there are any health risks,” Aldi North and Aldi South, the two operators of Aldi stores, said in a joint statement on Friday.

Aldi South’s 190 stores in Switzerland have stopped the sale of imported eggs, Aldi Suisse said in a separate statement. The Dutch organisation of food retailers CBL said on Friday all possibly contaminated eggs would be removed from the shelves of supermarkets in the Netherlands.

Albert Heijn, the country’s largest supermarket chain, said it had removed two thirds of the 38 different kind of eggs it normally sells. The company, part of Ahold Delhaize, said it could not yet estimate the cost of the move. Public prosecutors in Belgium and the Netherlands are investigating poultry service providers that are suspected of having added Dega 16 to their products, the European Commission said, without providing further details.

"Artist Gigi Scaria’s upcoming solo exhibition explores urbanisation, alienation and environmental devastation","What lies ahead: Artist Gigi Scaria explores the urban world in ‘Fragmented Reality’ What lies ahead: Artist Gigi Scaria explores the urban world in ‘Fragmented Reality’

Sometime last year, artist Gigi Scaria felt the need to understand the process of architectural model-making that is intrinsic to urban development. Concepts related to city-building have always intrigued him —as is evident from his artistic trajectory— but he wanted to meet the anonymous labourers who give shape to the vision of architects. He found one such worker not far from his home in Greater Noida and through him discovered the complexities of his trade.

Back in his studio, Scaria designed models of the future he anticipates, one where plastic skyscrapers jut out from a hollow bronze tree bark and where apartments carry with them a sense of alienation. “Urban stories all over the world nearly come to a standstill when we look deep into their relation with environmental devastation and exploitation of natural resources. The painful truth of human existence has made its brutal assertion on everything perceived and imagined,” says Scaria, explaining the ideas that guided his solo ‘All About This Side’ that will open at Aicon Gallery in New York on August 10.

On view will be installations, videos, watercolours and photographs where Scaria, 44, will deliberate on how “the future we imagined has already become a burden to carry forward”. “A fence against unaccepted realities and unappreciated future is already under construction. The walls that divide people are becoming more permanent, as opposed to building a better habitat for the ‘survivors’,” says Scaria. The titular work, ‘All About This Side’, is an inkjet print that has a long iron fence outside a mall under construction in Noida, marking the territorial boundary between those it is meant to cater to and the “have-nots” who are encouraged to view it all from a distance. In the installation ‘Philosopher’s Stone’, he presents cement as the legendary alchemical substance, and another installation, ‘Trial’, places alienated individuals in the witness stand, under trial for the sins they have unknowingly committed against ecology.

The exhibition in the US comes a year after his acclaimed solo at the Laumeier Sculpture Park in St Louis, Missouri, where he explored the architecture of St Louis and New Delhi. He was in the US in 2013 too, when his immersive installation ‘City Unclaimed’ was exhibited at the Smart Museum of Art in Chicago for almost a year. The photo-based mural of an imaginary cityscape showed the extreme disparities that exist in the Indian capital, and the accompanying twelve-foot high fountain resembled Delhi’s apartment buildings, with constantly flowing water raising concerns over scarcity and allocation of resources.

Build me a future: Plastic skyscrapers and lonely apartments. Build me a future: Plastic skyscrapers and lonely apartments.

“The issues are universal, only the nature and degree might vary,” says Scaria.

Engagement with the environment, urbanisation and migration have dominated Scaria’s work for over two decades now, ever since he moved to Delhi from his hometown Kothanalloor, a village in Kerala’s Kottayam district, in 1995. He was still pursuing his post graduation in art at Jamia Millia Islamia when he started sketching abstract maps of Delhi. As the city changed, numerous layers were added to the maps, as Scaria made notations to document its illegal constructions, mushrooming shopping malls or even the Delhi Metro that is gradually expanding across the city.

“When I first came to Delhi I was fascinated by the different language groups and the social and class hierarchies that were so blatant,” says Scaria. Even as he tried to understand its inner workings, the city emerged as his muse. His first solo in 1998 at a gallery near Jamia Millia in Delhi comprised his abstract maps and ceramic sculptures, but it was the much-acclaimed ‘Absence of an Architect’ at Palette Gallery in Delhi in 2007 that affirmed his position as an artist of reckoning.

Born to parents who owned shops in Kothanalloor, Scaria was six when his grandmother guided him to mould the crucified Christ with clay from paddy fields. He would spend hours reproducing Renaissance paintings and sculptures published in the Malayalam magazine Bhashaposhini. A curious child, he pondered over books in the local library, dreaming of fulfilling his own artistic pursuit. The quest for learning led him to experiment with multiple mediums: installations, screen prints, photography, painting and sculpture. It was after attending a residency at the Michelangelo Pistoletto Foundation in Italy through an Inlaks Scholarship in 2002, that he began to experiment with video art, a medium that was still nascent in India. “I was interested in filmmaking and this was an extension,” says Scaria. The subjects depicted contemporary concerns. For one of his early videos, ‘A day with Sohail and Mariyan’, in 2004, he followed two ragpickers for a month. In another video, ‘Raise your hands those who have touched him’, he interviewed people who had interacted with Mahatma Gandhi.

With layered works that address the past, present and the distant future, Scaria has consistently reflected on the complexities that we live with. Describing “one of the primary themes of Scaria’s art”, curator Ranjit Hoskote has written on how it addresses “the crisis that has been forced upon the planet as a result of the reckless onslaught that humankind has visited on its surroundings at a constantly accelerating pace since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution”. When Hoskote was invited to curate India’s first national pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2011, he chose Scaria to be part of the group that comprised four artists. At the prestigious art event, people reportedly queued up to enter Scaria’s video installation ‘Elevator From the Subcontinent. It transported viewers to India, taking them to urban homes belonging to people from different stratas of society.

At the second edition of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale in 2014-15, Scaria explored his home turf. Taking off from curator Jitish Kallat’s vision to turn Kochi into a pier from where artists would view the world, Scaria designed a 13-foot tall steel bell, moulded and welded in Coimbatore. Installed at the backyard of Pepper House, an 18th-century Dutch-style complex, by the Mappila Khalasis — traditional dockyard workers from the ancient port town of Beypore, located 180 km from Kochi — the work titled ‘Chronicle of the Shores Foretold’ also referred to the ancient folklore of the region where a European ship bringing a large bell for a church sunk due to the weight of the bell. “It is a tale children in Kerala are often told. We even celebrate the rising of these bells from the deep waters during an annual church festival,” says Scaria. He admits being more familiar with the land he grew up in than any other and has a connect with immigrants, whose sentiments he often depicts. After over two decades of living in Delhi, he still feels he doesn’t belong here. “I am very comfortable but I am still an outsider in some sense. That is the reality of today. None of us really belong to a particular place,” he says. His works, meanwhile, are being installed for the transoceanic audience— who, over the years, he has familiarised with the Delhi skyline.

"A year later, Olympic displaced are left to rebuild lives","It will take years, maybe decades, to understand the impact the Olympics had on Rio. (Source: File) It will take years, maybe decades, to understand the impact the Olympics had on Rio. (Source: File)

More than 70,000 people were displaced to make way for last year’s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Today some are satisfied in their new houses. Others had to start over and are struggling, bitter at the pressure from city officials and real estate speculators to relocate.

It will take years, maybe decades, to understand the impact the Olympics had on Rio. It’s the same for those who were forced to move from long-time, but often modest homes.

The mandatory relocation experience isn’t unique to Rio. London faced the same issue, as did Beijing before it. But Rio’s poverty and vast inequality helped draw attention to the actions of the city and Olympic organizers.

Former mayor Eduardo Paes was often credited by the International Olympic Committee as the moving force behind the event. Paes is currently being investigated for allegedly accepting at least 15 million reals ($5 million) in payments to facilitate construction projects tied to the games.

Here is what some Brazilians relocated by the Olympics had to say about their move:

VICTORY AMONG RUINS

Maria da Penha was one of the most vocal resisters of the Olympic-related evictions. She used to live in Vila Autodromo, the favela next to the Olympic Park. City Hall bulldozed her three-story house five months before the event, but even then she refused to leave. She now lives in one of the 20 whitewashed, identical bungalows the city had to build for them at the last minute.

“We managed to stay on this land, but my happiness is incomplete because we’re just 20 families out of 600,” she said. Much of the community’s old land was turned into a now-unused access road, and the survivors still struggle with deficient services. Around them, pieces of walls and kitchen tiles are a reminder of the aggression they faced.

Like many who fought eviction, they blame Paes for putting real estate interests above community rights. Paes did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

“They justified house demolition and interruption of life stories under the name of the Olympics,” Penha added.

GOOD BUSINESS

A 63-year-old foreman and fisherman, Jorge Ramos used to live in a multi-story house at Vila Autodromo with his wife and three adult children. Negotiating for his whole family, Ramos exchanged his old house for three 645-square-foot apartments at one of the social housing complexes, plus what he calls “sufficient” compensation.

Two years in, he is already refurbishing the failing pipes in his apartment. “Of course they were not going to be the best, because they were built in a hurry, but it’s up to each one to make it as cozy as they want,” he said.

While he laments the threats and aggression of City Hall, he considers himself a winner in the process. “What I had at Vila Autodromo was the house of my dreams, but I accepted that it was over and went looking for the best I could get,” he said.

THE HOUSING TRAP

Jane Nascimento was first evicted during the lead-up to the 2007 Pan American Games, and had to move out of her newer house again in 2015. She settled for two social housing apartments, one for each adult daughter, and 50,000 reals ($15,000) as compensation. The 61-year-old artisan lost her front teeth and much of her sight during the process, which she attributes to stress in the tussle with City Hall.

But while some lucked out on their apartment deals, she ended up in a much smaller place, inside an isolated condominium heavily monitored by militias. Her apartment resembles a tiny warehouse, and water keeps leaking from the roof.

“They took away my freedom to have a house, to have a dog, to work at home, even to move around at home,” she said. She wants to sell the apartments, but is scrambling to get all her paperwork done.

UNDER THE BUS

When the city presented its plans for transportation lines between Olympic venues, Daniel Ferreira’s house was right on one of the proposed tracks. “They came to measure, take some pictures and called me to offer 34,000 reals ($10,000),” he recalled.

Along with other neighbors, he fought back to move the line and save thousands of homes. His house still stands, but the city destroyed all access bridges to the houses in his street, and left a fetid river of sewage exposed.

“This may be a pile of rubbish for them, but it’s my castle,” he said. “Everything I conquered in life is here.”

SUCCESSFUL RESISTANCE

Despite being more than three miles away from the closest Olympic venue, the northern community of Indiana was also targeted by the city. Longtime residents like Marcello Deodoro recall the visit of city agents with promises of upgrading works. Soon after, they were told they had to leave and make room for a public square.

“For Paes, favela residents were a disgrace to the city, so any favela was at risk at the time,” Deodoro recalled. City Hall managed to create animosity between residents and tear down five houses before Paes was forced to backtrack and apologize in person. Despite the broken promises of better services, the community is still proud of that moment.

“We showed him we’re poor, but not dumb, and we deserve respect,” he added.

Partnership firm: Cheteshwar Pujara & Ajinkya Rahane,"Pujara and Rahane 103 took the wind out of the sails of the fielding side on Day One of the second Test. (Source: AP) Pujara and Rahane 103 took the wind out of the sails of the fielding side on Day One of the second Test. (Source: AP)

Scrunching the ball through the vast expanses on the leg-side, Cheteshwar Pujara set off for his 99th run. When he turned back for his 100th run, Ajinkya Rahane had begun swishing his fists in the air. As they passed each other, they stopped for a fist punch before Pujara completed his hundred, removed his helmet and smiled, before acknowledging the appreciation of the dressing room and the motley handful in the crowd.

Exactly 105 balls later, Pujara didn’t even wait for Rahane’s approval before steaming down the other end for the single that would complete the latter’s hundred. After 28 balls, the fatigued pair clambered up the narrow stairs of the dressing room, their association of 211 runs still intact, thus maximising India’s incredible fortune with the toss on a progressively deteriorating surface. India’s 344/3 was the kind of head start that had the potential to make this yet another one-sided Test match.

This is the longest they have batted together — Pujara usually tags along with Murali Vijay and Rahane with Virat Kohli. Not that they haven’t wriggled India out of emergencies in the past—the most glaring proof was their 118-run association in Bangalore, in the second innings against Australia on a spiteful pitch (to put it mildly) combating a bowling firm more purposeful and persistent that the three-pronged Sri Lanka’s spin attack. The latter was series defining; this one could turn out to be one, though the conditions were considerably less hostile than it was in Bangalore.

But when Rahane joined Pujara, shortly after lunch India were not in a strife, but still in a spot of bother. Sri Lanka had dislodged a fluent KL Rahul and an in-form Virat Kohli. Rangana Herath had settled into a sinister rhythm; the setting up of Kohli was high art. Usually, in such fine mood, he scythes through batting line-ups.

The close-in fielders formed a nice background score, amping up their decibels, clapping their hands at anything and lunging themselves on the ground. It was perhaps the only passage in the entire series so far that they’d looked fired-up and dominant. If they could nail one of them, they stood chance to run through the rest. However, for 51 overs, their wish remained just a wish, as they ran into two of India’s most resolute batsmen around, a pair that was as impregnable as it was indomitable.

What makes them most difficult to trouble, when in such good knick, is that they offer few chances. Pujara gave one when he was on one, but his soft hands ensured it fell beyond the grasp of Angelo Mathews, and another that flew past the short-leg’s futile clasp towards the lunch. Likewise, Rahane offered a more straightforward to the short-leg when he was on 88. But other that, they largely looked untroubled and hardly have the hosts even a sniff of a chance.

Killing them softly

They don’t pulverise bowlers to submission, with a flurry of boundaries or outlandish strokes, like Shikhar Dhawan or to a lesser extent Kohli. They rather exhaust them, with their subtle, nuanced deception — a single here, a two there, an occasional boundary or six off a gift-wrapped ball. Even the big strokes are not instinctive whims, but carefully-devised plans to dishevel a bowler’s plan. They don’t set the scoreboard in a frenzy, but would tax the scorers as much as the bludgeoners for they keep the scorecard ticking along.

But they are not identical—as is the popular perception—not in temperament, nor technique, nor strokes, nor scoring pattern either. It might be that they don’t exude that imposing bravura as some of their other teammates. As they showed numerous times in the course of their partnership, they are cut from a different cloth. Instructive in where they’d made their runs on Thursday. As many as 60 off Pujara’s runs were hoarded between square leg and long-on. He would either stay back to the spinner and blunt him midwicket or come forward and smother them through mid-on.

It was the inverse in Rahane’s case—the space between point and mid on fetching him 52 runs. He would instinctively drive anything marginally fuller through the offside. A classic example of their contrasting styles was how they faced left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara.

Pujara hung back on the back foot, unless it was really full. He would tuck and tickle him away through the leg-side. Rahane almost always met him full and on a few instances pulled out the sweep as well. A stroke that Pujara hardly ventures. Pujara was all flicks and wrists; Rahane was all drives and punches. Even when the latter cuts, he does it in front of point, unlike Pujara who plays the cuts fine, in a rather old-fashioned way, especially the flourish and how his front-leg too goes prominently across.

While Pujara scored 21 runs behind backward point, Rahane scored not a single run. Pujara is the classicist; Rahane the moderatist.

Temperamentally also they are different. Pujara is as old-worldish as you can get these days, at least in the early half of his innings. Rahane is more enterprising. He was just four balls old when whipped Herath from off-stump over midwicket. It was a risk-fraught stroke, as Herath can sometimes skid the ball into the batsman. But it was trademark Rahane. Pujara would have never ventured such a stroke at any point of the match. He could have just offered a dead-defensive blade.

Pujara’s knocks conform to a general pattern—vigilance till he reaches the 30s, before he gathers impetus. Rahane’s is a steadier tempo. Pujara ate up 112 balls to reach his half-century.

Rahane absorbed only 83 balls. But Pujara’s next 50 took only 51 deliveries, Rahane’s came off 67 balls. The only thread of sameness is perhaps that they don’t ooze the look-at-me machismo of their peers or even the cricket world at large.

Photos: Former crack addict turns Sao Paulo trash into livelihood,"Fabiana da Silva called the streets of São Paulo home for 16 years as one of hundreds of people trapped in cracolândia, the open-air drug markets in South America's biggest city. Now the street has become a livelihood for Silva, who has kicked an addiction to crack cocaine and moved into an informal two-story dwelling in a nearby slum.

Silva, 38, pulls her bright purple cart by hand through the São Paulo, piling it high with more than 400 kg (800 lbs) of recyclables picked from refuse to earn roughly 100 reais ($32) per day - the only money she earns to support three children.

UK acid attack survivors call for tougher sentences,"Acid attack victim Andreas Christopheros, poses for a photograph in his home in Truro, south-west England, Britain July 31, 2017.

Victims of acid attacks in Britain are calling on the government to enforce longer prison sentences and tighten controls on the sale of corrosive substances, after a jump in the number of cases last year and in 2017. The issue hit headlines after a recent spate of attacks, including one in June in which two cousins were doused with acid through a car window as they were out celebrating a birthday, prompting Interior Minister Amber Rudd to review legislation. There have been several acid attacks in London since, from robberies to gang-related violence.

The Home Office said it planned to set out guidance for prosecutors on classifying corrosive substances as dangerous weapons and to review sentencing guidelines.

“Other key actions will include a review of the Poisons Act to assess whether it should cover more acids and harmful substances and further work with retailers to agree measures to restrict the sales of acids and other corrosive substances,” said Sarah Newton, minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability.

For victims like 32-year-old Andreas Christopheros, who was assaulted at his home in 2014, that may bring little comfort. But he joins a chorus of acid attack survivors demanding that tough words become reality.

“I believe the UK has got its strategy towards this completely wrong,” he told Reuters at his home in Truro, a seaside town in southwest England.

“I strongly believe that the sentencing for anyone who carries out any form of acid attack, whether their intended victim is injured badly or not, should serve a life sentence, with a minimum term of 20 or more years.”

Crimes using corrosive substances in London jumped in 2016 to 431 from 261 in 2015, Metropolitan Police numbers show. So far this year, there have been 282.

There is no clear explanation for the rise, but it coincides with a crackdown on weapons including the “two strikes” rule requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of six months for people convicted of carrying a knife for the second time.

Jaf Shah, executive director of London-based non-profit Acid Survivors Trust International, described a “loophole” in the law whereby people possessing acid would not be charged but those carrying a gun or a knife could.

“There just aren’t appropriate levels of controls around acid,” Shah said. “If you are caught with acid, police have to prove intent, which is very difficult.”

Struggling to sleep

Christopheros’ ordeal began in December, 2014, when he answered a knock on the door thinking it was a courier bringing Christmas presents. Instead, a man he had never seen before threw a beaker of sulphuric acid in his face, saying: “This is for you, mate.” “My t-shirt disintegrated from top to bottom, it just rolled away into nothing. The pain was inexplicable,” he said in the same house, where he still lives with his wife and four-year-old son.

He was rushed to hospital where doctors told his wife and mother he may not live through the night. He said he was on “death watch” for weeks because of the risk of infection.

Ninety percent of Christopheros’ face has been reconstructed using skin from other parts of his body, including his scalp and neck. He has had between ten and twelve surgeries and will need more, he said.

He has lost his eyelids three times as the scarring on his face contracts, making sleep a constant struggle.

“Not having eyelids has probably been the most torturous thing that I’ve been through,” he said. “You can’t hide from the light. You can’t shut your eyes.”

Christopheros said the attack was a case of mistaken identity, as his assailant believed he had carried out a sexual assault on a family member but arrived at the wrong house.

After pleading guilty, his attacker was initially sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of eight years.

Christopheros later learned the assailant was granted an appeal, lifting his life sentence and changing his sentence to 16 years with a possibility of parole after eight.

“Three judges ended up concluding that life should be lifted from his sentence because he’s deemed not to be a danger to society, which is probably the most baffling part of the whole story,” Christopheros said. “It was a planned attack.”

Household products

Corrosive substances are often found in household products like drain or toilet cleaners and can easily be purchased in shops using cash.

An online search returned multiple websites selling 96 percent sulphuric acid, the same corrosive substance Christopheros’ attacker used. One litre could be purchased for less than 15 pounds ($20).

“A litre would be enough to destroy a dozen people’s lives, maybe more. Anyone can buy that,” Christopheros said.

Injuries suffered by victims of attacks using corrosive substances can require hundreds of surgeries and years of recovery, plastics surgeons who have worked on British acid attack survivors said. Even after extensive treatments, victims typically have scars for the rest of their lives.

“Sometimes people never recover if they have lifelong disfigurement and deformity,” said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesman for the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. He has treated 20 patients in 2017. Christopheros has had to cut back work as a local entrepreneur significantly as a result of his injuries. “The ultimate repercussions for an acid attack are lifelong,” he said.

Three road contractors to be blacklisted for two more years in Ahmedabad,"The decision has been taken since over one-third of the road length, built by Akash Infrastructure Project. (Express Photo) The decision has been taken since over one-third of the road length, built by Akash Infrastructure Project. (Express Photo)

Ahmedabad mayor Gautam Shah on Saturday accepted a proposal by municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar to blacklist three road contractors — already blacklisted for a year — for another two years. The decision has been taken since over one-third of the road length, built by Akash Infrastructure Project, GPC Infrastructure and J R Agrawal, has been heavily damaged this monsoon. Shah said, “Standing committed chairman Pravin Patel will clear the proposal next week. The vigilance inquiry against them is already in process.”

According to the municipal commissioner, Akash Infrastructure had built 33.66 km of road, of which 11.13 km had been badly damaged. “GPC Infrastructure built 13.98 km of road, of which 5.15 km was damaged.” The action follows widespread criticism of the administration for poor condition of roads during monsoon. Shah added that the blacklisting is just a preliminary action. “This strict action against the contractors will act as deterrent for others too. Fresh tenders will be issued for repair of the damaged roads,” Shah said.

Them becomes us: Maria Qamar’s Hatecopy spurs desi sarcasm in hilarious cartoons,"The hate is real: Artwork from Maria Qamar’s Hatecopy. The hate is real: Artwork from Maria Qamar’s Hatecopy.

When Maria Qamar moved to Canada from Pakistan as a nine-year-old in 2000, the transition was challenging. At her elementary school, she was picked on for her skin colour, her accent, and the smelly food in her lunchbox. While most kids would resort to writing a journal to deal with their feelings, Qamar turned to art – making comic strips in her sketchbook. “I would draw out what happened that day, and give it a happy ending. In real life, I got an egg thrown on my head; in my world, I was getting revenge or having the last laugh,” she says.

Today, Qamar, 26, is known as the artist of Hatecopy — whose Lichtenstein-style posts on desi oddities have racked up over one lakh followers on Instagram and found fans in Mindy Kaling and Lena Dunham. The central characters in Hatecopy are aunties — the judgmental tribe offering unsolicited advice, and the artwork hilariously depicts the struggles of south Asian immigrants in the west. In one, a wife tells her husband that their daughter didn’t pick up the phone and so, is obviously dead. In another, a shocked mother discovers that her “beti is an artist” — her husband says it’s her fault. This one is rather personal.

Despite her talent, Qamar was not allowed to pursue a career in the arts, with her mother even ripping off her drawings from her bedroom wall at one point. She took up advertising in college, and later, got a job as a copywriter. “It was a very sterile environment, with no real room for creativity. I would write jingles I thought sounded punny or quirky and, after 20 rounds of revisions, it would end up as something I didn’t even conceptualise… the work of 20 white dudes in suits,” she says.

After she was laid off from her copywriting job in early 2015, she started working on her art in between looking for other corporate jobs. She drew her first aunty, saying “I burned the rotis”, and put it on Instagram. “Little by little, it became a body of work.” Instagram offered the safe space Maria needed to reclaim her desiness.“The post about throwing a kurta over a crop top to get out of the house is so real. At school, there’d be girls coming in hijabs and taking them off to do their hair and make-up in the washroom. Many would have mini skirts underneath sweatpants. A lot of the humour is rooted in trauma… girls getting scrutinised for their choices,” says Qamar.

Maria Qamar. Maria Qamar.

Hatecopy offers a hyperbolic commentary on subjects like marriage and gender roles, and it also explores ignorance and cultural appropriation. “When I was bullied, I was often called a Paki dot. As a kid, I didn’t even know what that meant until I realised they were referring to the bindi, which is actually common to Indians, Sri Lankans and even Bangladeshis. It was annoying and I know girls who stopped wearing it,” she says, “Looking back, it’s like they tried to erase a part of our culture by beating us up over something they now make money off and wear at Coachella. They now market it as exotic jewels to wear at outdoor festivals. Why don’t you market it as a Paki dot, because that’s what you coined it?” she asks, also pointing to the appropriation of Indian food: “You now have packaged curries that make it easier for white people to make ‘korma sauce’ at home. The same thing we were shamed for is now a thing in your kitchen cabinet.”

Now, the Toronto-based artist is retailing Hatecopy merchandise, has had several exhibitions and is set to come out with an illustrated book, Trust No Aunty, next month. “It’s a collection of short interactions with different kinds of aunties, like the weight-watcher aunty and the online-stalker aunty, and the different ways of dealing with them,” she says.

While Instagram made her famous, Qamar hopes to do bigger exhibits, seeking greater representation for south Asians at mainstream gallery spaces. “It’s difficult to explain to a desi family why a career in the arts is realistic because they can go into a gallery and say, ‘where are we?’. It’s the fault of the art community as well, it’s not really a domain where people of colour are featured that often, whether it’s the Museum of Modern Art in New York or Louvre in Paris. If my work’s on display, other desi girls can show it to their families and explain that it can be a lucrative business.”

"Neymar to be feted in PSG stadium show, but miss league opener","PSG signed Neymar on a five-year contract. (Source: Reuters) PSG signed Neymar on a five-year contract. (Source: Reuters)

Delirious Paris St Germain fans got their first glimpse of world-record signing Neymar on Saturday although he was restricted to some pre-match ball juggling after being forced to sit out the Ligue 1 opener.

The Brazilian, whose 222 million euros ($261.32 million) signing from Barcelona doubled the world-record transfer fee, was prevented from making his debut against Amiens as his registration had gone through too late.

The issue failed to spoil the party mood in the Parc des Princes however, with Neymar’s appearance for a presentation before kickoff prompting huge cheers from the crowd.

Fireworks greeted Neymar’s appearance from the tunnel an hour ahead of the scheduled 1515GMT kickoff before he stood on a podium to address the crowd who chanted his name.

“Merci,” Neymar said, before adding via an interpreter that “my intention is to win many trophies with you.”

Neymar, who was joined by PSG’s CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi, then paraded around the pitch, showing his ball-juggling skills and ending up bare-chested after throwing his shirt into the crowd.

The stadium opened its doors early for the event, which also included French DJ Martin Solveig entertaining supporters, well ahead of kickoff against newly promoted Amiens.

Neymar, 25, joined on a five-year contract from Barcelona on Thursday after PSG met the cost of the buyout clause in his contract. PSG believe he will help them challenge for this year’s Champions League title.

He joins fellow Brazilian and former Barcelona team mate Dani Alves in the French capital after he joined from Juventus.

Neymar had said at a media presentation on Friday that he hoped to take part in PSG’s opening league match, although PSG did not need him, winning easily enough 2-0.

PSG, runners-up to Monaco last season after four successive titles, failed to meet a midnight deadline for a transfer certificate to be submitted to France’s professional football league, the LFP, from Spain’s football authorities, an LFP spokeswoman said on Saturday.

Saturday’s ceremony fuelled a marketing blitz by PSG, who on Friday sold 10,000 replica shirts printed with Neymar’s name and registered 500,000 euros in merchandise sales, according to news channel BFM TV.

Al-Khelaifi told reporters on Friday that the value of the club had risen by half a billion dollars since the signing of Neymar who will earn a salary of 45 million euro.

The excitement of the Brazilian star’s arrival in Paris has spread to supporters of other clubs.

Tickets for PSG’s first away match, at Guingamp next weekend, have already sold out and fans in Brittany may be rewarded by seeing Neymar make his debut for PSG.

Neymar’s arrival has raised hopes in France that Ligue 1’s profile will be boosted, although PSG’s Qatari owners have also drawn criticism for potentially undermining Financial Fair Play rules covering European clubs.

East UP: Over dozen cases of braid chopping emerge in last 2 days,"Police doubt the veracity of many of the claims. (File Photo) Police doubt the veracity of many of the claims. (File Photo)

Six incidents of women’s braids being chopped off by unknown persons were reported from eastern Uttar Pradesh on Saturday taking the total count of such claims to over a dozen in the last two days. However, police doubt the veracity of many of the claims. Anand Shukla, a resident of Kunda police station area in Pratapgarh a little off Allahabad told of an incident involving a 16-year-old girl who fainted after her braid was chopped off on Thursday.

“She has been in a state of semi consciousness for hours now. She is not talking out of trauma,” Shukla said.

A police inquiry, however, found that the girl’s relative from Amritsar had told her parents of government compensating such “victims” with Rs 1 lakh. Further questioning revealed the parents were behind the act, a senior police officer said. SHO, Kunda, A K Singh said, “The parents told us about a relative giving them the false news of compensation. But we still do not know how girl’s hair was chopped off.”

IG, Allahabad, Ramit Sharma said, “We have issued an advisory to local police and village councils to keep a tab on incidents of rumour mongering over unscientific things attached to these incidents and reports. We do not want any untoward incidents because of rumour mongering.” Similar incidents were reported from neighbouring areas of Phulpur, Jhunsi, Soraon and Deoli in Allahabad district. Villagers are also resorting to totems like lemons and chillies or turmeric paste to “ward off evil spirits” who they think are behind the incidents, Shiv Mohan, resident of Phulpur said.

This sudden spurt in similar incidents reported over the last two days in East UP comes almost a week after initial reports broke from Delhi, Haryana and West UP.

Sketches of a Poet’s soul,"Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature. Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature.

Book- Faiz Ahmad Faiz: Colour of My Heart, Selected Poems

Translated by- Baran Farooqi

Publication- Penguin Random House India

Pages- 304

Price- Rs 499

The name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds most people of melodious voices of Noor Jahan and Nayyara Noor, and the songs Mujh Se Pahli Si Muhobbat Meri Mehboob Na Mang, Ham Dekhenge or Aaj Bazar Mein Paa-ba Jolan Chalo. For those who have a deeper interest in Urdu poetry, it evokes many more images. Faiz symbolises a turning point in the history of the Urdu language — his name evokes memories of the Progressive Writers Association (PWA), his poetry is reminiscent of an era when the best of minds produced great literature in Urdu, which inspires writers and poets even today.

Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature. No nation state has been able to create impermeable fortifications thick enough to withstand the osmotic pressure which arts and literature produces. Even if these walls are constructed on the dense bedrock of hate and animosity.

Faiz’s poetry kept on transcending geographical boundaries and made him the most celebrated poet of the Indian subcontinent. But what makes Faiz unique, and I have said this earlier in an article, is that his poetry also transcends caste, class, regional and even linguistic boundaries. It is not unusual to see processions in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, where workers, students or political activists walk on streets with posters on which Bol Ke Lab Azaad Hain Tere or Nisar Main Teri Galyon Pe Aye Watan Ke Jahan, Chali Hai Rasm Ke Koi Na Sar Uttha Ke Chale is written. If you walk into a five star hotel and witness Faiz being sung by a renowned singer, it would not be considered out of the ordinary. Faiz is the only poet who has no adversaries. Even the mullahs in Pakistan did not pass a fatwa against him.

Faiz’s name also reminds us of the great divide between taraqqi pasand (the progressives) and jadidiyat pasand (modernists). Those who called themselves modernists in India were essentially anti-communist, backed by international groups who professed ‘art for the sake of art’ and ‘art with no political objective’. This group consistently attacked all writers, poets, filmmakers and artists who were members of PWA. Their politics drove them to condemn and reject all those who were committed to the idea of equality and justice, and created literature to build consciousness around these ideals.

Faiz demolished the wall created by the modernists. They initially tried to ignore him but did not succeed. In an Urdu magazine, Tehrik (Silver Jubilee Number), Wazir Agha wrote an article on ‘25 years of Urdu literature in Pakistan’. He listed the names of 30 poets, without mentioning Faiz. In passing elsewhere in the article, he mentioned Faiz as a progressive poet who “did not toe the party line and therefore created some good literary pieces”.

Similarly in Guftugoo, Balraj Komal, in an article titled ‘Poetry of Straight and Curvilinear Lines’, placed Faiz’s work on the border of this divide vis-a-vis Ali Sardar Jafri, Sahir Ludhyanvi and Josh Malihabadi; and, therefore categorised it as ‘effective’. These assertions were utterly false because Faiz remained committed to the ideals of socialism till his last breath. These were only excuses for liking a revolutionary poet. Almost every word of his poetry is dedicated to the idea of building an equitable and just society, yet his grandeur was accepted by even those who stood on the other side of the political fence.

The book Faiz Ahmad Faiz: Colour of My Heart, Selected Poems provides yet more proof of my assertion. In her introduction, the translator, Baran Farooqui, has made her political position very clear. She has referred to Faiz and many other progressive writers as “armchair socialists”, ignoring the fact that some of them, including Faiz, spent long years in jail for their ideological commitment. An unnecessary reference to Stalin could also have been avoided. She has not minced her words to reveal her unsympathetic attitude towards Faiz’s political views. The rest of the introduction is full of ‘illuminating’ information and she has translated the poems with utmost care, restrain and thoughtfulness. The soft, firm and robust ‘king of romantic realism’ deserves no less, even from those who do not agree with him. The ideological bias is completely absent in the translation.

When I read the list of 57 selected poems I was a bit disappointed that Intisab, Raqeeb Se, and Mauzu-e-Sukhan were missing. But when I moved on to the introduction it was clear that these poems did not measure up to the taste of the selector for obvious reasons.

If you are in love with a piece of literature in its original form — and I am an unashamed lover of every poem that Faiz wrote — then it is painful to read its translation. For me there are two indicators of good translation. The first test is: choose lines from the middle of a poem, read, and if you are able to recollect the original, then it is a good translation. I performed this test on every poem in this book. The second test is: the translated poem must invoke the same or similar feeling which the original does. Farooqi’s translation passes both these tests with very high marks. For all those who understand Urdu but cannot read ‘farsi rasm-ul khat’ the appendix provides transliteration of all selected poems, carefully scripted with the correct pronunciation of each word.

Farooqi refers to seven translators who introduced Faiz to non-Urdu readers, during his lifetime. I have not read all of them, but on the basis of whatever I’ve gone through, Farooqi’s translation is incredibly close to the spirit of Faiz’s poetry. I’m sure after reading this book, non-Urdu-Hindi readers will gain a deeper understanding of his life and poetry.

Extremist fighters lack good education and jobs: UN study,"The authors said that while the issue of FTFs has risen to the top of the political agenda in many countries, there is a lack of detailed knowledge about why people choose to join terrorist organizations — and why some return home. (Representational) The authors said that while the issue of FTFs has risen to the top of the political agenda in many countries, there is a lack of detailed knowledge about why people choose to join terrorist organizations — and why some return home. (Representational)

A U.N. study of 43 people who left their countries to become “foreign terrorist fighters” in Syria has found that most came from disadvantaged backgrounds, lacked good education and decent jobs — and saw their Muslim religion “in terms of justice and injustice rather than in terms of piety and spirituality.” The study for the U.N. Counter-Terrorism Center released Thursday said that based on interviews with the 42 men and one woman, a typical “foreign terrorist fighter,” or FTF, is most likely to be young, male and feel “their life lacked meaning.”

But Professor Hamed el-Said of Manchester Metropolitan University and British terrorism expert Richard Barrett, who conducted the study, said beyond that it’s difficult to generalize why they wanted to go to Syria. They cited “a mix of factors,” saying “social networks often seem to play a key role” and “equally important is the role and identity of the recruiters, who are not necessarily members of armed groups” but are more likely to be sympathizers.

Almost 40 percent of the sample said they were motivated to go to Syria by “an obligation to defend their fellow Sunnis from the Syrian government and its allies by force,” the report said. “This confirms that many Muslim youth, regardless of where they come from, perceive the conflict in Syria in community more than in religious terms. “The authors said this perception of a duty to defend their group during a war “is an important element in understanding what may motivate an individual to become an FTF.”

Other responses confirmed “the lack of ideology” as a motivating factor, they said, noting for example that “very few of this sample believe in the idea of an Islamic State or of establishing a caliphate in the Levant.” According to a U.N. estimate in March 2015, there were more than 25,000 FTFs from over 100 countries.

The authors said that while the issue of FTFs has risen to the top of the political agenda in many countries, there is a lack of detailed knowledge about why people choose to join terrorist organizations — and why some return home. The authors stressed that their study is not a random sample, but they said it is one of the largest samples of face-to-face interviews conducted with FTFs, and therefore they believe the report “adds significantly to current research.”

Of the 43 people interviewed representing 12 nationalities, 33, or 77 percent, reached Syria but subsequently decided to leave, the report said. The other 10 were either intercepted by authorities in their own country or stopped en route to Syria by authorities in a transit country. The authors said 26 were interviewed in prison, and the remaining 17 in official premises or public places arranged by security officials from the host country, though generally not in their presence.

Despite an appeal to all U.N. member states, the authors expressed regret that only seven countries agreed to participate in the study — three from the European Union and four from the Middle East and North Africa. The report said the participants “claimed they did not go to Syria with the intention of becoming a terrorist, nor did they return with that purpose in mind.” In Syria, most said the only military experience they received was a simple course on how to shoot with no bullets, “as shooting draws the attention of the enemy.” Only five of the 43 admitted to participating in fighting in Syria, the report said.

The authors said families had “a powerful influence” in convincing those interviewed to leave Syria, as well as their own “disillusionment” and “disappointment.”

El-Said and Barrett expressed hope that the study “will assist member states to design and implement policies and programs that discourage those who are about to or are thinking of going to Syria, and reintegrate those who have already returned, or who are about to do so,” with minimum risk to public safety.

A BJP youth leader was on Saturday arrested for the attack on Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s car while he was touring flood-hit areas in Banaskantha on Friday. Police said Jayesh Darji’s name was mentioned in Congress leaders’ complaint. Darji is general secretary of BJP’s Dhanera youth wing. “He (Darji) is alleged to be the main accused in the complaint,” Banaskantha SP Niraj Badgujar said. “More names may come up as

“More names may come up as investigation progresses,” PTI quoted him as saying. The police added IPC section 332 (for voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty) in the FIR after confirming that an SPG personnel was hurt, Badgujar said.

The FIR against unknown persons was filed under IPC sections 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life) and 427 (mischief causing damage to property). “We have confirmed that an SPG personnel who was travelling in the vehicle… sustained minor injuries,” he said. Darji, sources said, was spotted near Rahul’s convoy when a stone was thrown on his car.

Late on Friday night, Congress leaders, led by party’s state general secretary Lalji Desai and Arjun Modhwadia, sat on a dharna at Dhanera police station demanding FIR against the accused. “I don’t know about the case but he (Darji) runs an NGO named Manav Seva Sangathan. He has been actively participating in the aid of flood victims for the past 10 days,” said Haresh Chaudhary, president of BJP Yuva Morcha’s Banaskantha unit. Dozens of Congress workers were detained by the police as they protested against the attack in various parts of the state.

Yuki Bhambri subdues Gael Monfils storm at Citi Open,"Yuki Bhambri exults after the big win. (Source: Reuters) Yuki Bhambri exults after the big win. (Source: Reuters)

It is not often that the guy across the net from Gael Monfils is the one making the highlight reel. On Thursday, Yuki Bhambri managed to do that multiple times. With the deciding set of the Citi Open second-round contest at 3-3, 30-30, Monfils seemed to have finished the point with a volley into the deuce-court service box. The Frenchman then had no choice but to watch, almost in trepidation, as Bhambri zipped across the court to win the point with a down-the-line forehand, thwacked on the run.

Bhambri’s matter-of-fact celebration of the point was almost as subdued as the one at the end of the 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 win — perhaps, the biggest of his career. Sure, he defeated Italy’s Fabio Fognini, then ranked 16, via retirement at the 2014 Chennai Open. But a 200th-ranked player knocking out world No. 22 will always count as a massive upset, even though Bhambri and those in the know believe otherwise. “I was not at all surprised by his performance today,” says Aditya Sachdeva, who has coached the Delhi boy since childhood. “We have known that he is this good for quite a number of years. He has an uncanny ability to hit the ball very early.”

For Bhambri — who had to qualify to make the main draw of the ATP 500 event — the one hour, 51 minute-win over the defending champion wasn’t about announcing his arrival. “I had nothing to lose out there today, so I was pretty free and just went out there and had fun,” said Bhambri in a post-match interview. “Monfils is a great athlete and he runs down the points. I kept him on the defence and it’s a great feeling to be able to pull that off.”

More aggressive of the two, Bhambri took the attack to Monfils as he moped around the baseline. Quick off the blocks, Bhambri pocketed the first set with his first serve at 72 per cent. And while he lost the lead in the second set, Bhambri unsettled Monfils by rushing to the net and volleying on the fast Washington court. “I took my chances. I attacked when I had to. I came to the net when I thought it was the right moment. Took the right call to attack and choose a side and it all paid off today,” said Bhambri.

Sachdeva says the net play has taken years to develop. “This wasn’t a result of 1-2 months. We have been working on him coming to the net and closing out the points early so I was extremely delighted to see him work that into the game today. He was killing off so many points. A player who plays well at the net unsettles opponents nowadays.” Davis Cup captain Mahesh Bhupathi picked up on the ploy too. “He volleyed exceptionally well today. As a captain, it’s heartening to see how he was able to stick to a game plan and beat a top player. With a win like that, his confidence has to be sky high.”

A win like that could also end up being the latest of the apparent ‘turning points’ in Bhambri’s career. A former world No. 1 junior and 2009 Australian Open boys’ champion, Bhambri’s style was once compared to the likes of Novak Djokovic. However, despite flashes of brilliance, a never-ending struggle with injuries and rehabilitation saw him constantly lose ranking points and, more importantly, time.

Two years back, Bhambri looked to have turned his career around with a string of wins on the Challenger circuit. He reached 88 in the rankings in November 2015, before another lengthy layoff saw him finish 2016 at 532. He began this year with success on the Futures circuit and a convincing performance against New Zealand in the Davis Cup. But, like clockwork, he was again sidelined and ruled out of the tie against Uzbekistan due to a knee injury.

Now back playing at his best, the 25-year-old might just be ready to soar up the rankings once more. Bhupathi — who will welcome Bhambri back in the Davis Cup camp for the September tie against Canada — certainly believes so. “Yuki has won a lot of matches this season so it’s clear he is fully fit. Coming back from the injury and starting from scratch at the Futures is never easy, but there is no doubt about the level he can play, so it’s exciting for Indian tennis.” Sachdeva though knows it is not about the ranking but the time Bhambri spends on court. “The target for Yuki has always been the same. Play a whole year. It is unfortunate that he has had such a roller-coaster ride with injuries. It is again a testament to his mental strength that after every setback, he is ready to start afresh. We know that if he manages to play 25-30 weeks a season he will be right up there with the big boys.”

Case against Shabir Shah: NBW issued against Aslam Wani,"Shabir Shah Shabir Shah

A DELHI court has issued an “open-ended” Non-Bailable Warrant (NBW) against Aslam Wani, against whom the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had registered a case of alleged money laundering in 2007. An open-ended NBW does not carry a time limit for execution, unlike NBW.

The ED’s case in 2007 had come after Delhi Police’s Special Cell had arrested Wani, who comes from Kashmir, in 2005 and recovered a pistol and Rs 62.9 lakh from him. Wani had allegedly “confessed” to having worked as a courier for Kashmiri separatist leader Shabir Shah, who is currently in ED’s custody. Wani had allegedly stated that he had collected money from operators in Delhi and was supposed to deliver Rs 52.96 lakh to Shah.

ASJ Sidharth Sharma’s order assumes significance since Shah’s case was based on Wani’s arrest, even though in 2010 a Delhi court had dismissed charges against Wani for raising funds for terror activities. The court had then observed that the charges were “not proved”, and had convicted Wani only under Arms Act. The ED had moved an application in ASJ Sharma’s court on Friday, stating that despite several summons, Wani has not joined the probe.

Three people shot at San Francisco park packed with families,"Police are looking for at least one gunman who fled the scene yesterday, San Francisco Police Officer Grace Gatpandan said. (AP) Police are looking for at least one gunman who fled the scene yesterday, San Francisco Police Officer Grace Gatpandan said. (AP)

At least one gunman opened fire at a popular San Francisco park packed with families and tourists, leaving three people wounded and sending dozens of panicked people running, witnesses and police said. Police are looking for at least one gunman who fled the scene yesterday, San Francisco Police Officer Grace Gatpandan said. San Francisco General Hospital spokesman Brent Andrew said one of the victims remained in critical condition last evening.

Another man was treated and released, he said. The third victim, also a male, is a minor and remains hospitalized but Andrew wouldn’t provide any other details about him. Nearby resident Antonia Juhasz said she was sitting in Dolores Park when she heard a burst of gunshots.

“I saw a person with a gun in their hand running,” she said. “I think there were a total of three shots.” Juhasz, 47, said she saw two people who had been shot. Both were bleeding as emergency workers carried them away on stretchers, she said. San Francisco police advised people to stay away from Dolores Park right after the shooting but lifted that advisory two hours later. Dolores Park sits on a hill in the Mission District and is a popular destination for locals and tourists who come to sunbathe and take in city views. It’s near a high school. Juhasz, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 20 years, said the park was packed with families and tourists when the shots were fired.

“At first people didn’t totally react because it sounded like fireworks,” said Juhasz, a writer and freelance journalist. “I was yelling at people, ‘It’s actually a gun, it’s actually a gun.'” “It was terrifying, mostly because people weren’t reacting,” she added. People began running after realizing there had been gunshots, she said.

US pushes Asian nations on North Korea,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to build pressure on North Korea after securing a new round of United Nations sanctions as he launched into two days of high-level diplomacy on Sunday.

Tillerson is in Manila for a meeting of the 10-nation ASEAN regional bloc, but all eyes will be on his one-on-one talks with his counterparts from Washington’s great power rivals, Russia and China. He will also for the first time be in the same room as North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Hong-Yo, who defied US attempts to isolate Pyongyang to attend the ASEAN regional forum.

Ahead of Sunday’s talks, Tillerson visited the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial to pay tribute to more than 17,000 US and Filipino servicemen who died fighting as allies during World War II. After that he and his senior aides sat down first with Myanmar’s minister of state for foreign affairs, Kyaw Tin, then with South Korea’s Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-Wha.

Tillerson told reporters that he and Kang would be discussing the next steps to take on North Korea. He would not go into detail, but said the sanctions vote had been a “good outcome.” Kang chimed in: “It was a very, very good outcome.”

Tillerson was later expected to see Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and China’s Wang Yi — both key players in the North Korean nuclear standoff. The State Department has previously ruled out holding any direct talks with North Korea’s envoy Ri during Tillerson’s stay in Manila.

Just hours before the meetings were due to start, the UN Security Council voted unanimously to back a US-drafted resolution to dramatically tighten the existing sanctions targeting North Korea. The vote marked a victory for US moves to force the North to halt its development of a nuclear-armed missile that could threaten US cities, and took some pressure off Tillerson before his Manila meetings.

But the US envoy still wants to ensure that China, in particular, is ready to rigorously enforce the new trade bans and that Russia remains committed to the embargo despite other differences with Washington. Having failed to persuade its Southeast Asian allies not to invite Pyongyang to the forum, US officials also want to use the platform to remind Kim Jong-Un’s regime of its diplomatic isolation.

Moto C Plus preview: Hands-On With The Latest Budget Smartphone,"Moto C Plus smartphone with 4000 mAh battery has been launched in India. The smartphone, which has been priced at Rs 6,999, will go on sale from June 20 on Flipkart. I tested the Moto C Plus at the launch, and here’s my first impression of the smartphone. While Motorola has won accolades with the E series in the past, but somehow the limelight was soon shifted to Xiaomi’s Redmi series, which has been a huge hit in India. Now, Lenovo-owned Motorola is back in the budget segment with the release of the Moto C Plus."
U.S. suspends search for missing Marines after crash off Australia,"The MV-22 Osprey aircraft was in the region as part of the Australian-US joint military exercise Talisman Sabre, which has just concluded in Queensland state. (Reuters) The MV-22 Osprey aircraft was in the region as part of the Australian-US joint military exercise Talisman Sabre, which has just concluded in Queensland state. (Reuters)

The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps suspended their search and rescue efforts on Sunday for three U.S. Marines missing after their aircraft crashed into the sea off Australia’s northeast coast a day earlier, the U.S. Marine Corps said. The Marine Corps said they had shifted to recovery efforts in coordination with the Australian Defence Force, which could last several months, and had notified the next-of-kin of the three missing Marines.

Twenty-three other personnel aboard the MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft had been rescued, the III Marine Expeditionary Force, based in Okinawa, Japan, said in an earlier statement. Australian emergency officials said one person had been taken to hospital in Rockhamption in northeastern Queensland state but gave no other details. Ospreys have been involved in incidents resulting in deaths or injuries in recent years.

The latest incident took place off the coast of Shoalwater Bay in Queensland. Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology described wind, swell and atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident as “benign”. The U.S. Marines Corps has already said the incident was under investigation. The aircraft that crashed had launched from the USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6) amphibious assault ship and was on regular operations when it hit the water, according to the Marines Corps, and boats and aircraft on the ship immediately began search-and-rescue efforts.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who was on his first full day of vacation at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, was briefed on the crash by his chief of staff, retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, a White House official said. The Bonhomme Richard Expeditionary Strike Group was in Australia to participate in joint training manoeuvres involving more than 33,000 U.S. and Australian military personnel, which ended two weeks ago.

The exercises included the participation of MV-22 Ospreys practising the deployment of U.S. Marine reconnaissance teams. The Osprey, built by Boeing Co and Textron Inc’s Bell Helicopter unit, is designed to take off like a helicopter and rotate its propellers to fly like a plane. Its development was nearly cancelled after the deaths of 23 Marines during flight testing in 2000, but its speed and range have made it very popular in recent years. In December, the U.S. military grounded its Osprey fleet in Japan after one of the aircraft ditched into the sea, injuring its crew of five when a hose connected to the aircraft broke during a refuelling exercise.

Building wall least important thing: Donald Trump to Mexican President,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with Mexico’s President Enrique Pena Nieto (AP Photo/Dario Lopez-Mills, File) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with Mexico’s President Enrique Pena Nieto (AP Photo/Dario Lopez-Mills, File)

US President Donald Trump during his call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto acknowledged that his promise to get Mexico to pay for a controversial border wall has left him cornered as he described the wall “the least important thing”. The Washington Post yesterday posted highly classified transcripts of Trump’s conversations with Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in yet another embarrassing leak for the US President.

Trump promised throughout the 2016 campaign that not only will a wall on the Mexican-American border be built, but that Mexico would pay for it. Trump says he is building the wall to stop illegal immigration from Mexico. In his conversation with Nieto, Trump is heard pleading that the Mexican president should stop saying that Mexico would not pay for the wall. Trump seems to acknowledge that his threats to make Mexico pay had left him cornered politically, saying the fact is “we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall – I have to”.

“Believe it or not, this is the least important thing that we are talking about, but politically this might be the most important talk about. But in terms of dollars – or pesos – it is the least important thing. I know how to build very inexpensively, so it will be much lower than these numbers I am being presented with, and it will be a better wall and it will look nice. And it will do the job,” Trump said, while talking on the issue of building the wall on the Mexican-American border.

As per the transcripts, Trump is heard asking the Mexican leader not to tell the press that Mexico would not pay for the construction of the wall along the US-Mexico border. The building of the wall was one of the major electoral promises of the US president. During his election campaign, Trump had said that Mexico would pay for the wall. Pena Nieto has repeatedly said that Mexico will not pay for the wall.

“You cannot say that to the press. The press is going to go with that and I cannot live with that. You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances,” Trump told Pena Nieto, according to the transcripts. In his conversation with the Australian Prime Minister, Trump is heard getting agitated on the refugee issue and eventually telling him that the call was the most irksome of the day.

Transcripts of both the conversations that happened on January 27 and 28 respectively. The top American daily is now owned by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. The White House called the leak a national security issue, saying it will prevent the president from being able to do what he does best, and negotiate with foreign leaders. In a statement, The Washington Post said the transcripts prepared by the White House but have not been released. “The Post is publishing reproductions rather than original documents in order to protect sources. The reproductions below also include minor spelling and grammatical mistakes that appeared in the documents,” it said.

In his conversation with Turnbull, Trump says that accepting the refuges will “make us look awfully bad”.

“We have to stop. We have allowed so many people into our country that should not be here. We have our San Bernardino’s, we have had the World Trade Center come down because of people that should not have been in our country, and now we are supposed to take 2,000. It sends such a bad signal. You have no idea. It is such a bad thing,” Trump is quoted as saying in the transcripts.

The conversation between the two leaders grew sour as Trump rejected an agreement to take refugees.

“I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day,” Trump told Turnbull. “(Russian President Vladimir) Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous,” said the US President, as he abruptly ends the call.

Infants can judge people’s preferences: Study,"The findings confirmed that infants as young as 8 months are already developing the ability to see the world through someone else’s eyes, to sense what another person may or may not know, think or believe about a situation. (Source: File Photo) The findings confirmed that infants as young as 8 months are already developing the ability to see the world through someone else’s eyes, to sense what another person may or may not know, think or believe about a situation. (Source: File Photo)

Babies as young as 8 months can log our every move and make odds on what a person is most likely to do next, a study suggests. “Even before they can talk, babies are keeping close track of what’s going on in front of them and looking for patterns of activity that may suggest preferences,” said Lori Markson, associate professor at Washington University in the US.

“Make the same choice three or four times in a row, and babies as young as 8 months come to view that consistent behaviour as a preference,” said Markson. The findings demonstrated that infants look for consistent patterns of behaviour and make judgments about people’s preferences based on simple probabilities calculated from observed events and actions. The study may shed light on how infants and young children learn about people’s preferences for a certain kind of food, toy or activity.

It might also explain why kids always seem to want the toy that someone else is playing with. “Consistency seems to be an important factor for infants in helping them sort out what is happening in the world around them,” Markson said. “Our findings suggest that, if a person does something different even a single time, it undoes the notion of someone having a clear preference and changes an infant’s expectations for that individual’s behaviour. “In other words, if you break the routine, all bets are off in terms of what they expect from you,” said Markson.

The findings confirmed that infants as young as 8 months are already developing the ability to see the world through someone else’s eyes, to sense what another person may or may not know, think or believe about a situation. In the study, Markson and Yuyan Luo, an associate professor at University of Missouri-Columbia, conducted a series of experiments to track how infant “looking times”changed when an actor made an unexpected choice between one of two stuffed-animal toys displayed before the infant on a small puppet stage.

The experiments were conducted on a sample of 60 healthy,full-term infants with an even split of males and females ranging in age from 7 to 9 months and an average age of 8 and a half months. Seated on a parent’s lap, the infants watched as a young woman reached out and grabbed one of two stuffed animals on the stage, either a white-and-brown dog or a yellow duck with orange beak and a purple bonnet. After each four-trial familiarisation phase, the researcher observed the babies’ reactions as the women reappeared on the stage and made a fifth selection, either going back to the previously targeted duck or making a new selection of the dog.

Findings confirmed that the babies spent about 50 per cent more time looking at selections that represented a break from consistent patterns made in the familiarisation trials.

High Court orders compensation to family of man killed in army firing 32 years ago,"(Representational Image) (Representational Image)

The Gujarat High Court on Friday ordered the state government to give Rs 90,000 as compensation to the family of a man who was killed in firing by the Army during the Jagannath rath yatra in 1985. Justice J B Pardiwala held the state government responsible for Gulam Rasul Umedmiya Rathod’s death, observing that the Army was deployed to assist the local authorities in maintaining law and order. The court order stated, “The civil suit is allowed with a decree of the compensation of Rs 90,000 with interest at the rate of 7 per cent per annum from the date of the suit until the amount is realised.”

On June 20, 1985 when the rath yatra was passing through Prem Darwaja at Jordan Road in Dariapur area, Rathod was on the terrace of a building. It was alleged that the Army opened fire to control an unruly mob. A bullet hit Rathod who later succumbed to his injuries. Rathod’s family alleged that the Army opened fire without any warning or reason. It has also been claimed that the government had not given permission for taking out the rath yatra that day and curfew was enforced.

The High Court order said that “instead of taking the procession from outside the Prem Darwaja, the procession entered the walled city under Army’s surveillance; and all of a sudden, as alleged, the Army opened fire, resulting in Rathod’s death.” Rathod’s family filed a suit seeking damage in 1986 which was rejected in 1995. Later, they filed an appeal in the High Court which was also rejected by a single bench. The matter reached the division bench in 2011 which gave a split verdict with Justice Jayant Patel ordering a compensation of Rs 90,000.

However, Justice S R Brahmbhatt differed, saying, “…looking to the attending circumstances five rounds were fired and looking to fact that Jordan Road area is popular for such acts, go to show that the firing was not unjustifiable for such acts. Thereof, the unfortunate incident of death has occurred, to which the claim under the law of tort cannot be accepted.”

Following the split verdict, the chief justice placed the case before Justice J B Pardiwala in 2013. On Friday, Justice Pardiwala held that the petitioners grievance for compensation is proper and ordered the compensation considering the victim’s salary at the time of death was Rs 700 per month.

Gurgaon movie review: This Pankaj Tripathi and Ragini Khanna film is dark and dystopic,"Gurgaon movie review: The film’s brutalities—and there are plenty—are dulled, as is the impact. Gurgaon movie review: The film’s brutalities—and there are plenty—are dulled, as is the impact.

Gurgaon movie star rating: 2.5

Gurgaon movie director: Shanker Raman

Gurgaon movie cast: Akshay Oberoi, Ragini Khanna, Pankaj Tripathi

There’s something about Haryana. And it’s pride, the chrome-and-steel-girded Gurgaon, whose tall multi-storeys glint off the snaking metro line, whose fancy malls and cars jostle side by side with displaced farmers and a marginalised work force, and over-riding it all is a feeling that sharks roam the streets, teeth out. One bite, and you’re gone.

Shanker Raman’s Gurgaon is a bleak beacon on the shockingly unequal lives which inhabit the glitzy grimy township. The haves are typified by big land-owners who were at one-time land-grabbers. Property magnate Kehri Singh (Tripathi) is wealthy beyond his wildest dreams, but his conscience — he still has one—is an unwanted irritant. He has a dark past, and as his secrets come up for air, things unravel, for him and his family: older son Nikki (Oberoi), younger lad Chintu (Verma) and daughter Preet (Khanna), who has been away to college in the US, and is now back.

The haves rule, but their house is divided. And the have-nots try taking advantage, as and when they can: the law of the jungle, which is what Gurgaon is.

Raman’s film speaks in perfect tongues. The guttural, harsh Haryanvi is the hardest to emulate: in that, everyone is on board. It looks at the casual, cruel misogyny which springs out of implacable, unshakeable patriarchy that rules the lives of the protagonist. Kehri Singh’s word is law, and the reason why he favours his daughter over his sons takes us straight to the heart of darkness.

The most interesting part of the film is the struggle between entitled emasculated male pride and entrenched power structures, and the women around them who have to make room for themselves in this world, where they can be killed as soon as they are born.

But there’s something in the treatment, a distancing and an underlining, which keeps us at an arm’s length. The film’s brutalities—and there are plenty—are dulled, as is the impact.

That’s made up for, almost, by the terrific ensemble cast. Tripathi’s growly patriarch who is being eaten up from the inside but is still clinging on to his perch, is splendid. So is Bashir, as his younger brother who comes to his rescue when all else fails. Khanna and Vatsa, as daughter and mother, stand out too. Everyone else, including Oberoi and Varma, fits right in.

Gurgaon is dark and dystopic, and a solid, atmospheric debut. It tells us that power can never be permanent, and how the good may not always win. Uncomfortable, but true.

"Swine flu: 5 deaths in five days in UP, MLA Sangeet Som tests positive","At a city hospital during the 2015 swine flu outbreak. Archive photo At a city hospital during the 2015 swine flu outbreak. Archive photo

Five people have died and more than 100 have been tested positive for the H1N1 swine flu virus in Uttar Pradesh in the last five days, mostly from Lucknow. Sardana BJP MLA Sangeet Som too was diagnosed with the flu on Friday.

According to Dr. Padmakar Singh, Director General (DG), Medical and Health, the state has seen 10 deaths and around 190 confirmed cases of swine flu so far this year. “In these five days, we have witnessed an increase in the number and we are taking precautionary measures to stop it from further increase,” Singh said, adding that five deaths were reported from Lucknow. While two of the dead are from Lucknow, the others are from different districts but treated in hospitals here.

“Som was detected swine flu positive in test yesterday. Presently, he is admitted at the Yashoda Hospital in Ghaziabad and his condition is stable,” said Rajkumar, Chief Medical Officer, Meerut. On Saturday, State Health Minister Sidharth Nath Singh held a meeting over preparations in government hospitals to provide better treatment to swine flu patients and prevent its spread. The meeting was attended by Minister of State for health, Ashutosh Tandon and officials from WHO along with doctors from Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute (SGPGI) of Medical Sciences and King George Medical University (KGMU).

“In the meeting, the need of prevention was repeated as prevention is the only way to stop swine flu. We were told to spread awareness among people that in case of any flu symptoms like coughing, cold or fever, the patient should immediately be isolated and should be given a lot of water,” said Padmakar Singh. “The WHO officials, however, informed that though the virus this year is spreading fast, it is not as powerful as earlier,” he added, mentioning that as per the state guidelines, in case of minor symptoms which is the first stage, only isolating the patient is important and there is no need for a test.

“In the second stage, the patient should be given ‘Tamiflu’ and still there is no need for the test. Only in the third stage we should go for swine flu test,” Singh said. He claimed, though we are witnessing a significant increase in swine flu cases within the state, the number is still low in comparison to other states in the country.

Working It Out: Management lessons from the Ramayana,"When the King Janaka organised the wedding of his daughter Sita, fearsome warriors were invited to participate in a ‘Swayamvar spardha’- the competitive act of choosing one’s husband’. As a business owner, expect strong competition and learn whatever it takes to win what you want ethically. When the King Janaka organised the wedding of his daughter Sita, fearsome warriors were invited to participate in a ‘Swayamvar spardha’- the competitive act of choosing one’s husband’. As a business owner, expect strong competition and learn whatever it takes to win what you want ethically.

History teaches if we are willing to learn.

As an Indian, like most of my friends, I grew up listening to stories from epics like Ramayana and the Mahabharata. I personally believe that there are lot of things today’s 21st century managers and corporate leaders can learn from these wise pieces of literature. I suggest reading this article without any religious biases as the intent is just to learn from the historic or the mythological characters. Read this as a student of ‘history’ and you will gain the most out of it. If you have not read the Ramayana, I advise you to read a few pages about it on the Internet, this will help you get the most out of this article.

1. Never have too many controlling stakeholders in your business:

King Dashratha had three wives – Kaushalaya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi. Thus, when you have too many stakeholders in decision making, it becomes difficult to control your business. Kaushalya gave birth to Rama, Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharat and Sumitra gave birth to Laxmana and Shatrughana. Power dilutes when too many stakeholders take charge of any business.

2. Never sign a document without reading the terms and conditions:

Once queen Kaikeyi had saved King Dashratha’s life in battle. Dashratha was very pleased with his queen and thus in order to repay the favour, the king told her that she can ask for any two boons from the king. When Kaikeyi’s mind was influenced by her maid Manthara, she used these boons against her stepson Rama and tried to make her own son Bharata the next crowned king of the kingdom. She asked the king to send Rama on a 14-year-long exile to the forest and to declare her son Bharata as the next king of the kingdom. In business, you cannot trust anyone. Make sure, you have all the your contacts in black and white.

3. Learn from the experts:

King Dashratha sent his son Rama to sage Vishwamitra for learning the art of warfare. As the promoter or owner of the business, learn to send your children to the most suitable teacher. Raise your next generation of leaders by putting them in challenging situations. Help them develop the skills they must learn to face a challenging business environment.

4. Be willing to compete:

When the King Janaka organised the wedding of his daughter Sita, fearsome warriors were invited to participate in a ‘Swayamvar spardha’- the competitive act of choosing one’s husband’. The king organised a competition in which Rama defeated all other warriors and emerged as the most suitable candidate. As a business owner, expect strong competition and learn whatever it takes to win what you want ethically.

5. Do not covet what does not belong to you:

If you see the entire story plot of Ramayana you will realise that it is made up of storylines where human greed took charge. Kaikeyi wanted her son to be the next king; Ravana’s sister Surpanakha wanted to marry Laxmana, who rejected her evil advances and ended up cutting her nose; King Bali abducted the wife of his own brother Sugreeva. Likewise, Ravana wanted to possess Sita, who was the rightfully wedded wife of Rama. Ravana – blinded by his desire to possess Sita – ended up abducting her. The entire battle of Lanka was fought to free Sita from the shackles of the evil king Ravana. In your business too, learn to play ethical. Do not do anything illegal or overlook laws to secure a quick win.

6. Keep wise counsel:

Queen Kaikeyi kept an evil maid Manthara as her counsel. Over time, the woman managed to poison Kaikeyi’s mind against Rama. King Ravana avoided the counsel of his wife Mandodari who told her to return Sita respectfully to her husband. He did not listen to his own brother Vibhishana and kicked him out of his kingdom. Do not have subordinates who always try to flatter you. Surround yourself with a team of people who tell you what you need to know and not what you like to know.

7. Choose your joint venture alliances carefully:

Rama, in order to win, needed a powerful ally. Yet when it came to making an alliance, he choose Sugreeva over his powerful brother King Bali. Bali was a very powerful man who had already defeated Ravana once, and yet Rama did not join forces with him because he was an immoral man. He kicked his own brother Sugreeva out of the Kishkindha kingdom and abducted his wife. If you partner with wrong and unethical people you may win in the short run, but in the lose run will lose your reputation.

8. Negotiate and do not fight disruption:

Before declaring a full-scale war, Rama tried to negotiate with King Ravana by sending Angada as his emissary. Later on, even Hanumaan offered peace to Ravana, but he was so blinded in his ignorance that he failed to see a more powerful force. Innovate on your strategy regularly. Choose innovation over ignorance. A low of businesses die because their leader could not negotiate and adapt well to a powerful force of disruption. The businesses which do not change with time, eventually get destroyed.

Be a curious student and see what you should learn from Ramayana to take your professional life to the next level.

Taliban suicide bomber attacks NATO convoy in Afghanistan,"In this Monday, July 24, 2017 file photo, Men look at the remains of their properties at the site of a suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan. (Source: AP File photo) In this Monday, July 24, 2017 file photo, Men look at the remains of their properties at the site of a suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan. (Source: AP File photo)

A Taliban suicide bomber rammed a vehicle filled with explosives into a convoy of foreign forces in Afghanistan’s restive southern province of Kandahar causing casualties on Wednesday, officials said. “At around noon a car bomb targeted a convoy of foreign forces in Daman area of Kandahar,” provincial police spokesman Zia Durrani told AFP.

NATO confirmed in a statement that a convoy was attacked and did “cause casualties” but did not immediately give further details. At least one witness reported seeing three bodies pulled from one of vehicles.

Mohammad Azim, a shopkeeper, told AFP: “I saw a foreign forces vehicle on fire after the attack. A while later helicopters landed in the area, they took three bodies out of the vehicle and flew away. There were three armoured vehicles in the convoy.”

The Taliban, who have a heavy presence in poppy-growing Kandahar province and have launched repeated attacks there, quickly claimed the attack by text message to AFP.

The assault is the latest blow to NATO forces, who ended their more than a decade-long combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of 2014.

Since then Afghan troops and police, beset by soaring casualties, have struggled to beat back the resurgent Taliban, while facing the growing menace of the Islamic State group.

The Taliban have been ramping up their campaign against beleaguered government forces, underscoring rising insecurity in the war-torn country during the summer fighting season when the warmer weather tends to spur an increase in militant attacks.

A recent UN report described Kandahar, which lies on the border with Pakistan, as one of the most dangerous places in the country for civilians.

Jordan’s king on rare visit to Ramallah: Palestinians,"Jordanian King Abdullah II (Reuters Photo) Jordanian King Abdullah II (Reuters Photo)

Jordan’s King Abdullah II is to meet Monday with Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas on his first visit in five years to the West Bank city of Ramallah, a Palestinian official said. Mohammed Shtayyeh, a top official in the Fatah party of Abbas, told AFP on Saturday the two leaders would discuss efforts to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which has been at a standstill since 2014.

It will be the first visit since December 2012 by Abdullah – whose country is custodian of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem and which has a 2004 peace treaty with Israel – to the Palestinian political capital in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Jordan intervened last month to help resolve a crisis over access to the ultra-sensitive Haram al-Sharif mosque compound in the Old City of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, know to Jews as Temple Mount.

R Ashwin quickest to 2000 runs and 250 wickets in Test cricket,"R Ashwin is fastest player to reach 2000 runs and 250 wickets in Tests. (Source: AP) R Ashwin is fastest player to reach 2000 runs and 250 wickets in Tests. (Source: AP)

R Ashwin became the quickest to 250 wickets in Test cricket and he is on track to become the quickest bowler to 300 Test. But before that, Ashwin has reached yet another record in his Test career. Playing his 51st Test for India, the off-spinner scored his 2000th run during his 54-run innings against Sri Lanka in Colombo on Friday.

Ashwin, who has played 51 Tests, is now the fastest player to reach 2000 runs and 250 wickets in Test cricket. He went past great Richard Hadlee of New Zealand who took the same number of wickets and scored runs in 54 Tests. Former Pakistan all-rounder Imran Khan and former England all-rounder Ian Botham had achieved the same feat in 56 Tests.

Ashwin scored his 11th Test fifty and tenth batting at number six or below. Only England batsmen Ben Stokes (13) and Jonny Bairstow (11) have more fifty-plus scores than the former world number one all-rounder.

Ashwin also completed the double of 2000 Test runs and 200 wickets. He is fourth fastest to achieve this feat. Ian Botham leads this lead as he achieved this in 42 Test. India’s former captain Kapil Dev and Pakistan’s former captain Imran Khan achieved this feat in 50 Tests.

The Indian off-spinner has achieved the world number one ranking in all-rounder’s list and is currently number three in the bowler’s ranking in Tests.

Across the aisle: A counter-narrative will emerge,"I am absolutely certain that the suffering and struggles of different sections of the people will throw up a counter-narrative, writes P Chidambaram. I am absolutely certain that the suffering and struggles of different sections of the people will throw up a counter-narrative, writes P Chidambaram.

I am counting the number of people who have thrown in the towel. On Wednesday, July 26, 2017, it was Mr Nitish Kumar who abandoned his sword and steed and coronated himself (for the sixth time!) as the Chief Minister of Bihar. Given Bihar’s poverty, joblessness and divisiveness, it is astonishing to know that there is someone who regards the chair of chief minister of that state as a prize to be won at the cost of his credibility and self-respect.

It is noisily propagated that the Modi-Shah juggernaut is unstoppable. One must board it quickly or make way respectfully or be run over mercilessly. Since July 26, six Congress MLAs in Gujarat have signed the terms (visible and invisible) of surrender. Vast sections of the media have been co-opted by the ruling party and the government. There are censors in newsrooms and editorial boards. Academia has been invaded; an invitation has been extended by the Vice-Chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University to station an Army tank on the campus. A retired major general hails the ‘conquest’ of JNU and promises to conquer Hyderabad and Jadavpur very soon.’

The Post-Truth World

In the post-truth world, more and more people are believing what is not necessarily true. They believe that ideology is dead. The only ‘thing’ you have to believe in is ‘What’s in it for me?’. There is a lot in store for you if you believe in the muscular hyper-nationalism of the true (and only) nationalist Indians. The capture of institutions has just begun, there are many more, and they will throw up numerous opportunities for the true nationalists.

They believe that secularism is dead. State and religion will no longer be separate. The re-inauguration of the Sardar Sarovar project after the height of the dam was raised to 138.72 metres will be sanctified by the presence and prayers of 2,000 priests from all over the country.

They believe that liberalism is dead. Mr Dina Nath Batra and Mr Pahlaj Nihalani, and others like them, will be the new commissars of right thought, right behaviour and right culture. Anything that does not have their approval shall be presumed to be wrong and, therefore, proscribed.

Liberty, Equality, Fraternity

They believe that liberty is dead. The only liberty that deserves to be recognised is defined in the following words: ‘The only liberty worth having (is) the liberty of the State and of the individual within the State’. It is a minor detail that that definition was propounded by a gentleman named Mussolini.

They believe that equality is dead. There was never real equality in India —between religions, between castes, between genders. After the Vedic age, the laws of Manu were invented, varna was the prevailing dharma and India flourished without equality, so equality is no big deal. Those who had no part in making the Constitution of India have never accepted that equality was a legitimate national objective. It is therefore legitimate to ask for unequal rights and unequal privileges, especially if you belong to the ABVP or a gau rakshak group or the Vivekananda International Foundation, New Delhi.

They believe that fraternity is dead. It is perfectly normal to deny a house for rent to a Muslim or a Christian or a single woman or a non-vegetarian. It is perfectly legitimate to distinguish between non-Bengali maids and Bengali maids. It is perfectly legal to raze the hutments of the Bengali maids because they are anyway from Bangladesh.

They believe that English will be soon dead. The Committee of Parliament on Official Language will be requested to report regularly and frequently on ways and means to replace the use of English by the use of Hindi.

A Contrary View

I take a contrary view. I refuse to believe that liberty, equality or fraternity are or will be dead. These values are the soul of democracy and I believe that the people of India will never allow these values to die. Nor do I believe that the Indian people will abandon secularism and embrace Hindutva. The people know that secularism is the opposite of Hindutva. They also know that Hindutva will eventually mean a return to the days of domination of the upper castes and the oppression of the other backward castes and Dalits.

I refuse to believe that we live in a post-ideological world. Ideology is no longer captured by a single word like capitalism or communism. Every party has to craft its narrative taking into account changes in society and in the people’s aspirations. Is not Hindutva an ideology? Does not the BJP audaciously pitch the philosophy of Savarkar, Golwalkar and Deendayal Upadhyaya as a counter-narrative to the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Babasaheb Ambedkar?

I refuse to believe that the idea of India as enshrined in the Constitution can be destroyed. I refuse to believe that there are no Liu Xiaobos in India. I refuse to believe that the conscience of the media or authors or academia can be snuffed out for ever. I am reassured by the statements of 87 academics (July 13, 2017) and 114 defence veterans (August 1, 2017).

It is true that, at present, the opposition parties seem to have faltered in constructing an alternative narrative to majoritarianism and Hindutva. They have only themselves to blame, but I am absolutely certain that the suffering and struggles of different sections of the people will throw up a counter-narrative.

UEFA Super Cup: New signings to look out for in Manchester United-Real Madrid clash,"Theo Hernandez and Romelu Lukaku are among the new signings for Real Madrid and Manchester United respectively. Theo Hernandez and Romelu Lukaku are among the new signings for Real Madrid and Manchester United respectively.

Manchester United and Real Madrid – the two major clubs of the most popular football leagues in the world – are set to clash against each other on Tuesday. Even though Cristiano Ronaldo’s former and current clubs faced each other last month in the pre-season, a few things have changed since then like additions to the teams and transfers from them.

Here are new players to look out for in the most popular match of the pre-season:

REAL MADRID

Los Blancos are going to be without James Rodriguez and Alvaro Morata, the two players who were key in the Spanish team’s campaign last season in the later stages. The team, however, has not invested much in signings, having signed only two players this season.

Theo Hernández

Real Madrid signed Theo Hernández from Atletico for an initial €24m. However, Theo might not be regarded a first-team regular as he has never made a competitive appearance for Atlético despite being with the club since the age of 11.

Dani Ceballos

Dani Ceballos, the star of the Euro Under-21, has been signed by Real Madrid for €18m from Real Betis. He is being touted as Luka Modric’s heir. The 20-year old won the Player of the Tournament award as Spain reached the European Under-21 Championship final this summer. Madrid beat off competition from rivals Barcelona to clinch his signature.

MANCHESTER UNITED

Romelu Lukaku

As celebrated United player Wayne Rooney left for his boyhood club Everton, United bought Romelu Lukaku on a five-year contract in a £75m signing to fill the void that Rooney left. The 24-year old can be the new attacking threat for the Old Trafford side.

Nemanja Matic

Nemanja Matic completed his £40 million move from Chelsea to Manchester United to reunite with Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford. Tried and tested in the Premier League, Matic could turn out to be United’s most successful signing this season.

Victor Lindelof

Defender Victor Lindelof has been signed by the Premier League club for £31m from Benfica. But his challenge on Real Madrid left-back Theo Hernandez that made them give away a penalty in pre-season friendly drew Mourinho a lot of criticism for hiring him.

Theo Richardson

The 18-year old goalkeeper Theo Richardson signed a deal with United from Leeds after impressing on trial at the Old Trafford. He will compete with the likes of Kieran O’Hara and Dean Henderson for a starting berth.

Largie Ramazani

Belgian striker Largie Ramazani, who is only 16, is understood to have joined the club on a four-year deal after impressing scouts.

"PM Benjamin Netanyahu not forced to resign if indicted, says Israeli official","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Source: AP) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Source: AP)

Israel’s justice minister says even if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is indicted on corruption charges he is not compelled to resign. Ayelet Shaked tells Israel’s Channel 2 TV on Satruday that ministers have to, but not necessarily prime ministers. She said coalition partners will have to discuss the ethical ramifications of such a development but it was still premature.

Shaked is the most high-profile official to respond to news that Israeli police suspect Netanyahu of being involved in bribery, fraud and breach of trust in a pair of cases.

Netanyahu’s former chief of staff and longtime confidante has agreed to turn state witness and testify against his former mentor. This has raised speculation that Netanyahu could be indicted shortly.

Netanyahu has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and calls the accusations a witch hunt.

New Zealand’s new Opposition candidate Jacinda Ardern fields questions on her maternity plans,"New Zealand Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern answers questions from reporters on Tuesday in Wellington. (AP Photo) New Zealand Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern answers questions from reporters on Tuesday in Wellington. (AP Photo)

New Zealand’s charismatic new Labour leader, who took over in a desperate gamble to revive her struggling party seven weeks out from an election, spent her first 24 hours in the job fielding questions about babies rather than her policy plans. Jacinda Ardern, 37, took over as Labour’s youngest leader on Tuesday after her predecessor quit over “disturbing” opinion poll results, leaving little time to plot a strategy to break the centre-right National Party’s decade-long hold on power.

One of the first questions Ardern, 37, faced on Tuesday night was about whether she had made a choice between having children or a career. She took it in her stride and said she had spoken before about the dilemma that many women face. However, the question refused to go away and she clashed on Wednesday with a radio host who said New Zealanders needed to know whether she planned to have children, in the same way that companies would if they were employing a female worker.

Pointing her finger at AM Show panellist Mark Richardson, Ardern said “It is totally unacceptable in 2017 to say that women should have to answer that question in the workplace. It is a woman’s decision about when they choose to have children, it should not pre-determine whether or not they are given a job or have job opportunities,” she said.

The controversy was at odds with New Zealand’s progressive reputation, having been the first country to give women the right to vote in 1893. Ardern could also become New Zealand’s third female prime minister while many countries, including the United States, are yet to have their first. The issue was given added resonance by Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 U.S. presidential bid. About a third of the members in New Zealand’s parliament in 2014 were women, putting it ahead of Australia and Britain but behind Germany and most Nordic countries, according to the global Inter Parliamentary Union.

“I don’t think we could say New Zealand is still ahead of the curve when such a small percentage of our politicians are women, both at parliament and at local government level,” said Julie Anne Genter, a member of parliament for the Green Party. Genter also took issue with the tone of questions about Ardern’s family plans. “They’re just saying: ‘how can you do this job if you plan to have a family?’,” she said.

Figures also showed that women in New Zealand lagged behind their counterparts in Britain and Australian in representation on company boards.

With Labour facing a crushing defeat at the Sept. 23 election, Ardern took over in the hope she could breathe new life into the party. Analysts saw it as a potential game-changer for a poll that until now had been seen as a slam-dunk for Prime Minister Bill English’s National Party.

Donald Trump’s new top aide John Kelly assures Jeff Sessions his job is safe,"US chief of staff John Kelly. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, Files) US chief of staff John Kelly. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, Files)

New White House chief of staff John Kelly, in one of his first acts in his new post, called Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reassure him that his position was safe despite the recent onslaught of criticism he has taken from President Donald Trump.

Kelly called Sessions on Saturday to stress that the White House was supportive of his work and wanted him to continue his job, according to two people familiar with the call. The people demanded anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about a private conversation. Kelly, who was appointed to the post the day before, described the president as still miffed at Sessions but did not plan to fire him or hope he would resign.

Trump has seethed at Sessions, his one-time close ally, since the attorney general recused himself from the probe into Russia’s meddling into the 2016 election. The president viewed that decision as disloyal _ the most grievous sin in Trump’s orbit.

That simmering anger burst to the surface last week. In an unprecedented display of a president publicly criticizing a sitting member of his own Cabinet, Trump unleashed repeated attacks via Twitter.

He called Sessions “beleaguered” and “very weak” and belittled his decision not to investigate Hillary Clinton. He said he was “disappointed” in Sessions and suggested that, had he known he would recuse himself, he never would had offered him the attorney general post. And he dismissed the value in Sessions’ early endorsement _ he was the first senator to back Trump _ while privately musing to aides about firing the attorney general.

“We will see what happens,” Trump said of Sessions’ future when asked at a news conference last week. “Time will well. Time will tell.”

Trump is known for openly considering staffing changes without following through. Likewise, Sessions’ newfound job security could also be viewed as temporary and subject to the president’s whims.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the conversation. The Department of Justice also did not immediately respond. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that “the president has 100 percent confidence in all members of his Cabinet” and dismissed talk that Sessions or other Cabinet members could be moved.

Kelly, a retired general, was brought in from the Department of Homeland Secretary to restore some discipline and stability to a chaotic White House. The outreach to Sessions appears to have been a top priority in that effort.

Despite Trump’s continuing anger, his allies quickly recognized the danger in attacking Sessions. The longtime Alabama senator was the forefather of many of Trump’s hardline immigration policies and remains very popular among the president’s conservative base.

Sessions and Kelly have also been allies and traveled together to the Mexican border in April to highlight immigration plans when the chief of staff was in his former post as head of homeland security.

Moreover, many Republican senators and influential members of the conservative media rushed to the attorney general’s defense when Trump went on the attack last week. They suggested that Sessions has been the most effective member of Trump’s Cabinet delivering on campaign promises, while some White House aides feared that firing Sessions could spark a significant political backlash.

Instead, the White House has recently embraced some of Sessions’ directives. On Friday, Trump traveled to Long Island, New York, to tout his administration’s efforts to combat the MS-13 gang at the same time Sessions was in El Salvador for events concerning the same violent cartel. Though Trump did not mention Sessions by name, the attorney general told The Associated Press that he hoped to remain in the post and would serve as long as Trump wanted him.

And on Wednesday, senior White House aide Stephen Miller _ a former Sessions staffer who has written most of Trump’s speeches on immigration _ delivered a full-throated case for slashing legal immigration. The proposal is unlikely to become law since it is opposed by several Republican senators, yet it is popular among much of the president’s base.

"Indonesia, Russia sign MoU to trade palm, coffee for Sukhoi jets","Russia is currently facing a new round of U.S.-imposed trade sanctions, while Indonesia is trying to promote its palm oil products amid threats of a cut in consumption by EU countries Russia is currently facing a new round of U.S.-imposed trade sanctions, while Indonesia is trying to promote its palm oil products amid threats of a cut in consumption by EU countries

Indonesian state trading company PT Perusahaan Perdagangan Indonesia and Russian state conglomerate Rostec have signed a preliminary deal to trade Sukhoi SU-35 jets for commodities like palm oil and coffee, the Indonesian trade ministry said. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed in Moscow and further details about the expected deal will be announced in the coming days by the Indonesian trade and defense ministers, Indonesian trade ministry official Imam Pambagyo said on Sunday.

“This barter under the supervision of both governments hopefully will soon be realised through the exchange of eleven Sukhoi SU-35s and a number of Indonesian exports, starting from coffee and tea to palm oil and strategic defence products,” Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita said in a statement released on Friday. There were no details on the value of the deal or the quantity of commodities Indonesia would potentially ship to Russia.

Lukita was in Moscow for an Indonesia-Russia business forum. Russia is currently facing a new round of U.S.-imposed trade sanctions, while Indonesia is trying to promote its palm oil products amid threats of a cut in consumption by European Union countries. Lukita said Indonesia is trying to expand its trade and partnerships with Russia as that country is currently under a trade embargo with the United States and the EU.

Indonesia, which had a $411 million trade surplus with Russia in 2016, aims to expand its partnership in tourism, education, energy, technology and aviation among others.

Irish PM Leo Varadkar calls for ‘unique solutions’ to UK-EU ties,"Ireland’s Taoiseach Leo Varadkar speaks at Queen’s University Belfast, Northern Ireland August 4, 2017. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne Ireland’s Taoiseach Leo Varadkar speaks at Queen’s University Belfast, Northern Ireland August 4, 2017. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called on Friday for the European Union and Britain to find “unique solutions” to their Brexit logjam, including a bespoke customs union. That would solve the problem of a hard border in Ireland once Britain has left the EU, something that is of great concern to Dublin . Varadkar, a new face at EU summits since taking office in June, also suggested Brussels may accede to Britain’s insistence that a post-Brexit body other than the European Court of Justice oversee bilateral issues, such as citizens rights and aviation regulation. He said, however, that all these “practical solutions” would need to be asked for and would not be offered.

Varadkar was speaking in the British province of Northern Ireland as part of a drive to find a compromise that would avoid a hugely damaging hard border being erected across the island of Ireland. Dublin is hoping compromise can be reached ahead of a key Brexit summit in October, which Varadkar described as a “historic meeting for this island.”

“Time is running out and I fear there will be no extra time allowed,” he told students at the Great Hall at Queen’s University in Belfast . In a wide-ranging speech during his first visit to Northern Ireland as Irish prime minister, Varadkar made several proposals to try to break the Brexit logjam.

He said a bilateral customs union could be based on one the EU currently has with Turkey. “If we have one with Turkey. Surely we can have one with the United Kingdom?” he said. British Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain will leave the EU’s customs union when it leaves the bloc in order to pursue its own trade agreements with countries around the world.

A bilateral customs union would appear to imply that both sides would be free to strike deals with third parties, though Varadkar did not provide detail of the proposal. British membership of the European Free Trade Agreement was also an option, or failing that, Britain could remain in the single market and the customs union during a transition phase, he said.

IRISH BORDER?

Ireland, which after Brexit will have the EU’s only land border with the United Kingdom, is widely seen as the EU country most exposed to the fall-out from Britain’s leaving. The issue of how the Republic and Northern Ireland will fare is particularly sensitive given the decades of violence in the province over whether it should be part of Britain or Ireland. Around 3,600 people were killed before the 1998 peace agreement.

Varadkar last week said his government would oppose any customs posts or immigration checks on the land border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, but he did not say where they should be placed instead. There have been no customs or immigration checks on the 500 km (310 mile) border since the European single market came into effect in 1993. About 30,000 people cross every day without any border checks.

The future of that border is one of three issues — along with EU citizens’ rights and British budget payments to the EU — on which Brussels says there must be “significant progress” before talks can begin on the free-trade deal London wants. Varadkar also suggested that the EU may be considering compromise on its insistence that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) oversee key elements of any future relationship, such as citizens’ rights to live in the United Kingdom and the oversight of regulation of sectors like aviation and nuclear power.

May’s opposition to any oversight by the ECJ has been a key stumbling block in talks. “At the moment the mechanism by which most European agreements are upheld is through the European Court of Justice and the United Kingdom has indicated it no longer wishes to be part of. So we would need to develop some other mechanism,” Varadkar said.

At the recently concluded India Couture Week 2017, Aditi Rao Hydari turned out to be a perfect muse to designer Gaurav Gupta for his Moondust collection. The Wazir actress looked breathtaking in a deconstructed gown which was the perfect mix of ‘East meets West’ with Indian craftsmanship and modern European techniques at its best. We love everything about this look, starting from her outfit, make-up and hair. But it’s not just on the ramp that this Bollywood beauty has been spilling her magic.

At the after-party, Hydari made heads turn in a sensual black number from SR Store. Celebrity stylist Sanam Ratansi, who curated this look, styled it beautifully with a pair of strappy Steve Madden heels. We love the summery vibe of this outfit with the floral touches to it – so simple yet so statement-worthy.

Needless to say, she carried the thigh-high slit dress with ease. She totally skipped on jewellery but it’s not something we are complaining about. The look is so breezy that it’s actually a welcome change to go without accessories.

Her hair and make-up is worth mention as well, especially with her good friend and talented celebrity make-up artist Elton J Fernandez working his charm. The dewy sheen with the nude lips and gorgeous curls styled to one side was the perfect addition to this look. We would definitely want to try something like this on a date night. What about you?

Do you like her style? Let us know in the comments below.

Suu Kyi’s man in Yangon under fire over transit deal with China,"Aung San Suu Kyi (Reuters/Files) Aung San Suu Kyi (Reuters/Files)

Aung San Suu Kyi’s first major infrastructure project could hardly be more visible – hundreds of new yellow buses now plying the streets of Yangon in what her ruling party hopes will be a potent symbol of how it is transforming peoples’ lives. But two deals to import 2,000 buses from China estimated at more than $100 million have caused an unusual rift within her National League for Democracy (NLD), with regional lawmakers questioning its cost and accusing Yangon’s chief minister Phyo Min Thein, a Suu Kyi protégé, of cronyism and a lack of accountability. “Phyo Min Thein’s government lacks transparency,” said Kyaw Zay Ya, a Yangon NLD lawmaker. “The image of the government will be damaged if he doesn’t change.”

The deal, struck with Chinese companies and a businessman with ties to the junta that ruled Myanmar for decades, has also soured relations with the West, according to diplomats.

While there is no evidence that any laws were broken in the awarding of the contracts, Roland Kobia, the EU ambassador to Myanmar, complained in a private letter to Commerce Minister Than Myint of a lack of transparency in public procurements. “Currently, the domestic economy remains dominated by a small number of domestic and regional actors whose long-standing practices prevent fair competition,” Kobia wrote in the June dated letter, seen by Reuters. The letter did not specifically refer to the bus deal.

Although the Chinese buses were about half the price of international rivals, engineers who inspected them for Myanmar predict that they will wear out and need to be replaced far sooner than the international standard. Phyo Min Thein declined several interview requests from Reuters. He and other ministers have previously defended the deal, saying the government-to-government agreement with China offered a discount price and express delivery.

EU ambassador Kobia said in a statement in response to Reuters’ questions that “many European actors stand ready to work in Myanmar, but more needs to be done to give them a fair chance to compete for contracts”. He was referring to the broader issue of transparency in public procurements, the EU said.

Myanmar’s commerce ministry spokesperson Khin Maung Lwin declined to comment.

When Suu Kyi swept to power in an electoral landslide in 2015, analysts predicted Western companies, whose government’s had cheered on the transition to democracy in the Southeast Asian nation that began in 2011, would flock to the country. But the Yangon bus deal underscores that Suu Kyi’s backers in the West have grown disillusioned as Myanmar increasingly prefers to do business with China.

In A Hurry

Phyo Min Thein, a charismatic 48-year-old who spent about 15 years behind bars for opposing the junta, likes to tell people he has no more time to waste. His bid to overhaul Yangon’s antiquated transit system offers Suu Kyi’s party one of its first opportunities to tangibly improve the lives of more than 2 million commuters in a city that overwhelmingly voted for the NLD at the last election.

Yangon officials last year rejected a proposal to improve the transit network from the World Bank’s investment arm, the International Finance Corporation, due to differences over the details of the plan, which required detailed traffic monitoring and an open tender process. Initial talks with potential French and Dutch suppliers also came to nothing, because they could not deliver the number of buses with the speed the chief minister was demanding, diplomats and lobbyists involved said.

Instead Yangon Bus Public Company (YBPC), a public-private joint venture majority-owned by the city government, bought 1,000 buses from two Chinese suppliers picked by Beijing’s ambassador to Myanmar, Hong Liang. Another 1,000 buses were bought from a third Chinese company in a private deal by businessman Kyaw Ne Win, a grandson of former junta leader Ne Win.

There was no public tender or debate in the regional legislature before the deals were agreed. “Yes, people can say that there’s no transparency,” said YBPC chairman Maung Aung. “But calling a tender is not necessarily better. The deal was struck to maintain good relations between the two countries.”

China The Dealmaker

Under Suu Kyi – whose status as darling of the West has been tarnished over allegations of atrocities by security forces against the Rohingya Muslim minority – China and Myanmar have sought to repair ties strained when a previous semi-civilian government blocked a China-backed dam project in 2011.

On a trip to China in September, Suu Kyi and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed how Myanmar could take advantage of China’s “Belt and Road” infrastructure investment programme, according to a senior official in Myanmar’s President’s office. Suu Kyi said there were some concerns in Myanmar about the quality of Chinese products, prompting Xi to propose the Chinese embassy could help find the best suppliers, said a senior official from a Chinese company involved in the deal.

The cost of the vehicles was set at $56,000 each and deal was signed on April 11. Two months later the chosen firms, state-run Anhui Ankai Automobil Co Ltd and Zhengzhou Yutong Bus Co, had each delivered 500 yellow buses. Privately-owned Zhengzhou Yutong is led by Yuxiang Tang, a member of China’s National People’s Congress. The criteria under which the two firms were selected is not known, although Maung Aung said provincial Chinese governments where the two firms are based had given guarantees of quality.

Both Ankai and Yutong did not respond to requests for comments.

Such arrangements were “very rare”, said the manager at one of the selected Chinese makers, because “in other countries, there usually is a tender process and we need to follow related regulations”.

The Chinese embassy in Yangon did not respond to requests for comment.

Value For Money

While an improvement on the 40-year-old unairconditioned vehicles in which long-suffering Yangon commuters have sweltered for years, Soe Aung, an engineer who inspected the Chinese buses for Myanmar before purchase, acknowledged they were of lower quality than European or Japanese alternatives, which he estimated would have cost around twice as much. “This project is only for five years,” said Soe Aung, adding that the vehicles would be worn out with daily use over that timeframe.

Officials say after that they will be replaced with electric vehicles, but some critics regard that as unrealistic in a country with an acute shortage of power that is not expected to be solved for at least a decade.

Western experts in public transport procurement say the average lifespan of buses would typically be more than twice that. “It seems inefficient to me to be introducing a new technology, while planning a replacement technology in such a short time period,” said Robert Marshall, global director of planning and landscape at consulting firm B+H Architects.

Unanswered Questions

When regional MPs approved 70 billion kyat ($51.5 million)for the project in December, they could only vote for “money for transportation”.

After the contract was signed in April, some lawmakers complained that questions on financing, the business plan and how the buses were chosen were dodged or went unanswered. Myint Thaung, Yangon region’s minister of planning and finance, declined to provide more details to Reuters on how the deal was financed.

The involvement of Kyaw Ne Win, whose grandfather led Myanmar’s ruling junta until 1988, has particularly incensed some NLD lawmakers. Opponents say it smacks of the cronyism under the junta, when lucrative contracts were routinely doled out to a small group of well-connected businessmen.

The junta leader scion bought the buses from Beiqi Foton Motor Co Ltd – another Chinese state-owned company, but declined to discuss the details of the deal. Beiqi Foton did not respond to a request to comment.

The deal, which will make Kyaw Ne Win the city’s largest bus operator, was “simple and straightforward”, he said, adding he wanted to “provide good service for the people of Yangon”. ($1 = 1,360.0000 kyat)

Happy Friendship Day: TV stars share their craziest memories with BFFs,"Happy Friendship Day: From Vivek Dahiya to Tina Dutta, here are celebs who are celebrating Friendship Day. Happy Friendship Day: From Vivek Dahiya to Tina Dutta, here are celebs who are celebrating Friendship Day.

“Har ek friend kamina hota hai…” when Ali Zafar sang the song teasing his friends in Chashme Baddoor, we wonder if he knew that the song would resonate with us. Friends are not just our constant companion and a person who we open our heart too, they are also the ones with whom we can have the craziest times. A meme on the internet rightly states, “The person who bails you out of jail is a friend, but your best friend is the one sitting beside you behind the bars.” As the world celebrates Friendship Day today, indianexpress.com spoke to popular TV celebrities about the stars’ wild memories with their friends. It might have been scary and embarrassing then, but brings a smile when they reminisce about their old days. So, read on to know more about your favourite stars and their camaraderie with friends.

Vivek Dahiya: I have been friends with Raza for more than a decade now. We have spent some wonderful times together but there’s this one time when he acted like a true kamina, though we laugh about it now. During our university days, I was a hyperactive person and one day I decided to climb up a tree in the vicinity. Though I managed to reach the top, I did not know how to get down. Raza, who was finding the whole scenario hilarious, called the fire brigade to aid me. It was so embarrassing when the uniformed officers rescued me from the tree top. And funnily, he had also summoned an ambulance in case I jumped and got injured.

Shantanu Maheshwari: My friendship with Macedon Dmello, who I worked with in Dil Dostii Dance and the World of Dance competition, goes long back to my college days. We have had some amazing times and memories through our college days, and one memory I will forever cherish is when we had to dress up as girls for a dance competition! We were dressed in female costumes with brooms in our hand and it was hilarious. We both pulled each other’s legs and had a great time together.

Tina Dutta: I love my best friend Aneri Desai. With her, I can share every little secret, laugh and cry and just be me. The only time we have an awkwardness is when I put her in a spot in front of a guy she’s crushing on. I also try hooking her up with guys, and whenever I do that, she gives me those murderous looks. But all in fun, for she knows I really love her a lot.

Keith Sequeira: When I was back in my school in Delhi, we had some good times and memories which I will forever cherish! One of them is the time when my closest friend Manish Katiyal and I had along with two other boys, bunked high school to go watch a matinee show of a Shah Rukh Khan film, and grab some beers! But on reaching the theater we, unfortunately, bumped into one of our school teachers, who was also catching the same show! Only we know how we had managed to get out of that confusion! But when Manish and I look back at that time now, we know we really have some awesome memories to keep forever!

Gautam Rode: There was this one time when my best friend Nigaar Khan was new to driving. Just after a few driving lessons, she decided to take me out for a drive. Sitting on the passenger seat, I was screaming with fear for I had no confidence at her being a driver then. I was so paranoid that I made her stop the car in the middle of the road causing a traffic jam and got her off the wheel. She still hasn’t forgiven me for embarrassing her and for not being supportive to a learner.

Aashka Goradia: My friendship with Dolly has grown over the years. There is this super crazy incident between us that we still laugh about. We had decided to go for a movie next day but Dolly mistakenly booked the tickets for the same day. I was on the other side of the town, almost 30 km away, and had to drive to the theater within 45 minutes. Though the movie wasn’t that great, it’s probably the most memorable movie we’ve seen together.

Vikkas Manaktala: So, I was bunking tuitions classes with my best friend ‘Bawa’ from Delhi, and was stopped by a traffic cop for a routine check. The cop asked me for RC, and I responded with a yes. As I turned, I see my friend sweating profusely assuming that the cop is asking for a bribe. He mistook RC as the whiskey brand, not realising the cop asked for the registration certificate. Apart from dealing with the cop and my paranoid friend, I was also worried about our families getting to know we bunked our class. What a crazy day it was!

Anuj Sachdeva: I once tried fooling my friend Kunal Vohra and it was hilarious. I asked my house help to inform him that I have fainted suddenly at home. I recorded the video when he rushed home and the song ‘April fool banaya’ started playing. He was so furious with me as he had got really scared getting to know that I fainted. It’s the funniest memory I have with Kunal.

Happy Friendship Day! Do share your crazy stories with your friends in the comment box below.

England’s James Anderson presses home advantage against South Africa,"James Anderson has so far picked four wickets against South Africa in first innings of 4th Test. (Source: Reuters) James Anderson has so far picked four wickets against South Africa in first innings of 4th Test. (Source: Reuters)

Jimmy Anderson put England in firm control on the second day of the fourth test at Old Trafford on Saturday, with his four wickets leaving South Africa trailing by 142 runs with just one first-innings wicket remaining.

Anderson’s 4-33, ably supported by fellow seamer Stuart Broad, reduced South Africa to 220-9 at the close and gives England, who lead 2-1, a great chance of securing their first home series win over the Proteas since 1998.

Earlier Anderson had provided support to Jonny Bairstow, who struck a brilliant 99, 46 of those runs coming in a last-wicket 50-run partnership with the bowler.

Bairstow’s enterprising and entertaining knock ensured England made a good first-innings total of 362.

Lancashire paceman Anderson certainly enjoyed the chance to bowl from the newly named ‘James Anderson End’ at his home ground – with all of his wickets coming from there.

“I felt like I couldn’t bowl badly, certainly this morning,” he said. “It feels very strange still to hear it be announced, but I’m thrilled and nice to get some wickets there as well.”

Anderson was a threat from the outset. He picked up the wicket of Dean Elgar for a duck before lunch, trapping the South African opener lbw with just his third delivery.

Hashim Amla looked in good shape, but after making 30 runs off 35 balls, he edged a leg-side delivery from Toby Roland-Jones to Bairstow.

The surface was looking increasingly placid and while England’s seamers were accurate and keeping the run-rate down, they were not posing too many questions for Heino Kuhn and Temba Bavuma.

The pair looked to have dug themselves in but spinner Moeen Ali, a hat-trick hero in the last test, tempted Kuhn forward with a nicely flighted delivery and Ben Stokes pocketed the catch at slip.

After tea, though, Anderson produced a devastating spell of three wickets from 24 balls as England turned the screw.

Bavuma (46) misjudged by leaving a ball which cut back in to take his off-stump. Two balls later the crowd sensed a major momentum shift when skipper Faf du Plessis’s inside edge rattled the stumps.

Theunis de Bruyn tried to drive a full-length delivery from Anderson but was undone by the movement and edged to England skipper Joe Root at second slip.

Keshav Maharaj misjudged the length of a Moeen delivery and found himself on the back foot, hit on the pads in front of the wicket as the tourists reeled.

Quinton de Kock showed some resistance, making 24 runs from 66 balls, before he nicked Broad’s rising delivery to the grateful Bairstow.

Broad struck again in the final over of the day, with Stokes producing a brilliant, low, diving catch at gully to dismiss Kagiso Rabada.

The day had begun promisingly for South Africa who had made quick progress in the morning session, picking up three early wickets to have England at 312 for nine.

But Bairstow, rotating the strike well, went on the offensive, with his fine attacking innings including a superb straight six off Duanne Olivier.

The Yorkshireman, who had been dropped by wicketkeeper De Kock on 53, fell just one short of his fourth test century, ruled lbw after attempting to sweep spinner Maharaj.

Seamer Rabada finished with figures of 4-91.

Out of my mind: When facts change,"As Keynes said “When facts change I change my opinions. What do you do?” Nitish Kumar would agree. (Source: PTI Photo) As Keynes said “When facts change I change my opinions. What do you do?” Nitish Kumar would agree. (Source: PTI Photo)

Nitish Kumar’s breakup of the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) has generated an incredible amount of comment in the media. There are attempts to read greater significance in it, to denigrate Nitish Kumar as an opportunist, to decry the state of secular politics and so on. These analyses are based on as short-term a perspective as one is getting used to in the media. If a week is a long time in politics, a year is eternity and totally forgotten. The problem of reading ideological meanings into the move is that the facts will not bear the burden of the analysis.

Let us revert to IBM — India Before Modi. In those obviously safe, secular, liberal, enlightened days (according to the Congress), there was unanimity as to the Idea of India. It was a time of a happy Congress parivar except for the naughty child BJP which had to be constrained. In 1998, the surprise came in the form of the BJP/NDA government with Atal Bihari Vajpayee (just a mukhauta for the sinister ideology behind him) in the lead. Nitish Kumar and the JD(U) were part of the coalition and he was a successful railways minister. (In the spirit of Bihari competition, Lalu succeeded Nitish as a railway minister in the UPA).

After the BJP/NDA went out of power, the JD(U) stuck to its friendship with the BJP, and won the 2005 and 2010 elections. That coalition delivered the most clean and successful regime in Bihar since 1947. Bihar saw law and order restored, growth accelerated and women and girls were placed at the centre. Budgets were as nearly balanced as possible thanks to the genius of Sushil Modi.

It all went awry with the arrival of Narendra Modi as the likely choice of the BJP to be its leader in the forthcoming elections. This was not to everyone’s liking even within the BJP. Nitish Kumar had his differences with Modi but more than that he felt he was senior to Modi in the NDA. While Modi had won thrice in Gujarat, there was the issue of the 2002 riots. Nitish had won two elections and been in the Central Cabinet in the first BJP/ NDA government. It was a status battle. They are both ambitious men and Nitish obviously thought he should have led the coalition in 2014.

Hence the break in 2013. It was not ideological. It was strategic. It was predictable that breaking up would be a mistake as the good governance in Bihar would suffer. But it was to allow himself the freedom to head a new NDA coalition had Modi fallen short and got only 180 seats, as even his own party was hoping. Modi surprised everyone by delivering an outright majority. The BJP/ NDA route was closed to Nitish Kumar if he wanted the highest political job.

He took a gamble in 2015 with the MGB. It was obvious that the alliance with Lalu would not last. The quality of governance delivered by the 2005-2013 government was not matched by the 2015- 2017 coalition. By 2017, it was also clear that an anti-BJP coalition would not work. The proof came in UP elections that Modi would win in 2019. As Keynes said “When facts change I change my opinions. What do you do?” Nitish Kumar would agree.

‘Ghongadi’ glows: A new lease for the age-old Maharashtrian blanket,"A group of young entrepreneurs from Pune are now planning to revive the market for such blankets through an e-commerce platform. A group of young entrepreneurs from Pune are now planning to revive the market for such blankets through an e-commerce platform.

Once considered an indispensable part of a household, the traditional woollen blanket of Maharashtra — the ghongadi — has lost much of its ground over the last few years. A group of young entrepreneurs from Pune are now planning to revive the market for such blankets through an e-commerce platform — Ghongadi.com. The brainchild of engineers Tushar Pakhare, Niraj Borate and dentist Madhura Avinash, the website offers traditional weavers from rural parts of the state an alternative market.

Known for its rough texture, the woollen blankets are spun on pit looms and dyed with organic and natural dyes.

These blankets have been prepared mostly by the Dhangard, or the traditional sheep rearers, of the state.

On an average, it takes about seven days to spin a ghongadi. “Known as natural thermal blankets, a ghongadi is relatively easy to maintain and has a longer lifespan than other blankets. However, lack of marketing options had relegated these blankets far from the shelves of city-based stores… the artisans have also had a tough life,” said the founders.

Pakhare, who hails from the Karmala tehshil of Solapur district, said they decided to start the website after conducting a market research. “We had conducted a survey on social media, which took views from around 200 people. The results were quite positive,” said Pakhare. Ghongadi.com had started online retailing of the blanket last month. “…in a span of just two weeks, we sold 50 ghongadis,” he added. The portal has tie ups with around 12 artisans in Karmala taluka of Solapur district. “At present, we buy four-five blankets on a regular basis. Once the volume picks up, we will increase our purchase,” he added.

Backend operations are managed by a coordinator at Karmala who ships the blankets to Pune, from where it is sent out for delivery. An individual blanket is purchased from the artisan’s end at Rs 1,100 and is sold at Rs 1,500. The difference is spent on shipping and administrative expenses, said Pakhare. Pakhare added that the higher margins charged by established players in the e-commerce sector have prevented them from joining hands with them. “For a handcrafted product, such high margins will shoot up the prices,” he said. “We are trying for online and offline collaborations with like-minded people, who are trying to save such art forms,” he added.

Old Trafford’s Pavilion End renamed after James Anderson,"England’s James Anderson and Chairman of Lancashire CCC, David Hodgkiss unveil the end named after him at Old Trafford. (Source: Reuters) England’s James Anderson and Chairman of Lancashire CCC, David Hodgkiss unveil the end named after him at Old Trafford. (Source: Reuters)

Veteran England fast bowler James Anderson has received a rare honour as one of the stands in the Old Trafford ground is set to be renamed in his honour. From the fourth Test onwards the Pavillion end will be known as The James Anderson End. This honour comes in the wake of Anderson becoming the leading Test wicket taker for the Three Lions.

“I’m blown away, really, by the gesture from the club,” he told reporters at Old Trafford on Thursday. “I can’t quite believe it has happened. It is something that usually happens when people have stopped playing or are further down the line. So to have this happen when I’m still playing and potentially bowling from that end in the game, is a bit surreal.”

“I don’t like looking back on my career too much because I am still playing and I still have things I want to achieve, personally and with this team,” he said.

“I’d like to win the Ashes again,” he said. “I think this team can achieve great things in the next couple of years and I’d like to be around to be a part of it and help the team improve. “For me, that’s what keeps me going and keeps me hungry to keep playing the game.” He added: “I’ve felt really good in this series. Barring me slipping in the shower or a back spasm overnight, I’ll have played all four games. “I’ve had a couple of injuries over the last 12-18 months so staying fit is a priority.”

It may be Sachin Tendulkar had also received a similar honour when one of the stands at the Wankhede stadium was named after him.

"Take 5: ‘Lakhs can die, but not the guardian of people’","The building is hardly 25 years old; ideally, it should have a life of 50 to 60 years. The building is hardly 25 years old; ideally, it should have a life of 50 to 60 years.

On July 13, the ceiling of the room occupied by Satish Patil in Maharashtra MLA hostel ‘Manora’ collapsed. The MLAs are now set to get furnished flats in a plush part of Mumbai. Patil, 47, of the Nationalist Congress Party and the MLA of Erandol speaks to The Sunday Express.

Where were you when the incident occurred?

Thankfully, I was not in the building. I was in my constituency because of the weekend break. I returned for the Assembly session and found the caved ceiling. Had I stayed back on the weekend, my fellow MLAs would have been paying homage to me today.

Has something like this ever happened to you before?

By the grace of God, it has never happened, and I am praying it doesn’t.

Whom do you blame for the incident?

People tend to blame politicians when such incidents occur, saying that they are corrupt, but bureaucrats tend to get off scot-free. The building is hardly 25 years old; ideally, it should have a life of 50 to 60 years. The kind of monitoring that officials should do for projects is sadly not being done. We are seeing this lethargy in monitoring of a building where public representatives reside. Imagine what must be happening with other projects.

Do you think public representatives should be given flats? Shouldn’t they make their own arrangements?

We are public representatives and the voice of voters in our constituencies. So many legislators come from outside and do not have a place to live in Mumbai. These flats are necessary because of their proximity to the Legislative Assembly and Mantralaya (the secretariat). We have to attend Assembly sessions which start early in the morning. Staying far away would mean wasting important time on travel. Moreover, if the government put us up in hotels, it would be a huge burden on the exchequer.

What advice would you give the government on ensuring safety of such buildings?

It is not only about safety of buildings but also security of public representatives. I can sleep anywhere, even on a bed-sheet on the ground. Not to belittle anyone but there is a saying in Marathi — Lakh mele tari chaltil, pan lakhacha poshinda jaglach pahije (Lakhs can die, but the guardian of people should not). We are the voice of lakhs of people, the state should at least guarantee our safety when we lie down after a hard day’s work.

India face Sri Lanka resistance after enforcing follow-on,"Kusal Mendis scored his third Test hundred for Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters) Kusal Mendis scored his third Test hundred for Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters)

R Ashwin was turning it square and Ravindra Jadeja was making the delivery rip through with bounce. Both Indian spinners were wreaking havoc on Sri Lanka batsmen and it seemed that the SSC pitch in Colombo will crumble. Sri Lanka were bowled out for 183 at the stroke of Lunch and India, after taking a 439-run lead, were set seal the game after asking the hosts to follow-on.

But surprisingly, Sri Lanka reached 209 for the loss of only two wickets at Stumps on Day 3 with Kusal Medis scoring a century and Dimuth Karunaratne remained unbeaten on 92. Suddenly, Ashwin’s deliveries were missing the rip while Jadeja could only vary his pace.

The ball went past the outside edge and there was awkward bounce but both Mendis and Karunaratne launched a bold counter-attack and took runs all-round the park. Neither spinner was spared of the sweeps and drives which not only disturbed their line but they were left searching for a better length as well.

Sri Lanka were set to have the two take them to stumps but Mendis fell five overs before close of play when Hardik Pandya, after bowling some wayward bowling, got one to comeback and Mendis got a inside edge on to his thigh pad which ballooned up to Wriddhiman Saha who dived in front to take a clean catch.

Nightwatchman and debutant Malinda Pushpakumara survived the final moments which looked more like how the morning where the ball spun of the pitch and Indian spinners dominating play.

Mendis scored 110 runs with 68 off them coming in boundaries as he made full use of one life he was offered. Shikhar Dhawan dropped him on 1 at mid-on, the ball hitting his wrist. The counter-attack was more about his confidence as he managed to score those runs in just 135 balls.

His partner Karunaratne took a different approach by playing shots that were under his control. He did not take risks apart from the odd reverse sweep. But that shot gave him more runs than giving India better chance to dismissing him. He was beaten many times by Indian bowlers but the opener continued to play at his supreme level of concentration.

This was in complete contrast of what Sri Lanka faced in the first innings. Resuming at 50 for 2, the hosts lost their first wicket when Dinesh Chandimal swept Ravindra Jadeja straight to square-leg.

Ashwin picked up his 26th five-wicket haul in Test cricket on the third morning of the Test and bowled out the hosts for a low score of 183 in their first innings. India asked Sri Lanka to follow-on as they took a lead of 439 runs.

Jadeja also took two wickets while Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav shared three wickets among themselves in the morning. Shami came as the fourth bowler in the day and he picked up two wickets in the first over itself.

While there were deliveries that bounced, spun and turned square, Niroshan Dickwella was unfazed by all this and the wickets falling at the other end. For a moment, Angelo Mathews and Dickwella were dealing in fours and sixes. The Sri Lanka wicket-keeper completed his half-century off just 44 balls.

But he was out trying the fancy shots. Shami kept it wicket-to-wicket and Dickwella went for a scoop. Shuffling across and completely exposing his stumps, he missed the ball and was bowled. This was on the first ball of the over. On the final, Herath received a fullish delivery that he had no clue about and was bowled.

Dickwella had a 53-run partnership with Mathews but that was not enough for Sri Lanka to save the follow-on. Mathews also took the aggressive approach. He clobbered Ashwin and Jadeja for a six each, picked up boundaries in his 26-run innings. He countered the extreme spin of the spinners with his shot but it was not be for long.

Ashwin got one to turn sharply which Mathews tried to deflect off his pads but that went to the left of Cheteshwar Pujara at leg-slip. He dived and grabbed a stunning one-handed catch inches off the ground.

Dhananjaya de Silva received a dream Jadeja delivery first up which left his in disbelief as he was bowled. This was his second wicket of the day and his 150th in Test cricket.

Once Ashwin picked up the wicket of Dilruwan Perera with a peach of a delivery that turned into him, the players waited to know if Nuwan Pradeep, who had his hamstring pulled while bowling, will come out to bat or not.

An injured Pradeep walked out to bat and after his 12-run stand with Malinda Pushpakumara, he became the final wicket to fall as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 183.

Mothers supporting child’s negative emotions can impact their social adjustment: Study,"Mothers’ supportive reactions predicted fewer socio-emotional skills and more behaviour problems. (Source: File photo) Mothers’ supportive reactions predicted fewer socio-emotional skills and more behaviour problems. (Source: File photo)

Dear parents, you may have to stop favouring your child in every situation, as according to a study, mothers supporting their child’s negative emotions may impact their social adjustment and social interaction in school.

According to a study, mothers, who are more supportive of their children’s negative emotions, rate their children as being more socially skilled and these same children appear less socially adjusted when rated by teachers.

Specifically, mothers’ supportive reactions predicted fewer socio-emotional skills and more behaviour problems, according to children’s third-grade teachers.

These contrasting patterns suggest a potential downside to mothers’ supportiveness of children’s negative emotions for third-grade children’s social adjustment in school.

Co-author of the study Dr. Vanessa Castro said that it’s not clear, if the parents are causing these problems by hovering or providing too much support when less support is needed or if the parents are rightfully providing more support because their children are experiencing these social and emotional problems, or if the children are exhibiting very different emotional and social behaviors at home than they are at school.

The findings suggest that is may be helpful for parents to consider other strategies to guide their children to develop their own skills in emotion regulation and social interaction.

Social damages might have more lasting impact on economy than wrong policies: Economist Kaushik Basu,"Former World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu. (Reuters) Former World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu. (Reuters)

Amid a debate over incidents of lynching, noted economist Kaushik Basu has warned that social damages could have a long-lasting impact on the economy than some wrong policy moves, “such as demonetisation”. Delivering the 23rd Lalit Doshi memorial lecture here yesterday, he stressed on the need to have open debates and discussions on issues facing the country.

“I have a concern on the social side in our country. It does worry me. The lynching news… is of the kind that disappoints me while sitting in America,” Basu, the C Marks professor of economics at Cornell University of the US, said here.

“Social damages to an economy can take much longer to correct than demonetisation or a wrong economic move that can be corrected,” he said.

India is a society that is poor, but is respected for its scientific temper and research, and “we should not backtrack on that,” the former World Bank chief economist said. The former chief economic advisor said in every society there will be people who destabilise its harmony while talking about the culture and make efforts to go back to that culture.

“We should be proud of our heritage, but we do not want to retreat (to the past). If we do so, that can have a long-lasting effect, not only on the quality of social life, but even on the economy,” he said.

He said one should take pride in one’s literature and culture, but at the same time, should also be pragmatic.

“One example that hurts me as a Bengali from Kolkata is a 1983 decision on easing out English from primary school and making Bengali the primary language of teaching.

“This cultural attempt to reclaim your history by not picking up an instrument, which is a vital instrument for engagement with the modern world, has done huge damages to Bengal’s economy,” Basu said.

He said people at the top level of the government are concerned about this but there is a need to make an effort to translate these concerns into policy on the ground. Stressing the need to have open debates and discussions on issues, he said, “It’s very important that in a country like ours, you can do serious debates and discuss. You can say that these two policies are good policies and these two are bad.

“If you do not get into these discussions, you will make mistakes and that would really be very unfortunate for the country and the economy in the long run. I just like to believe that we will keep it open.”

About demonetisation, he said it was a very big mistake and has huge negative fallouts. He welcomed the GST rollout, saying the new tax regime has some teething trouble but it was the right thing to do. Hailing the bankruptcy law, he said this is an excellent piece of legislation that can improve the country’s ranking in the ease of doing business list that the World Bank releases annually.

Rwanda: Paul Kagame wins presidential election for the third time,"Presidential candidate Frank Habineza, of the opposition Democratic Green Party, gives the thumbs up after casting his ballot in Rwanda’s capital Kigali on Friday.

Rwanda’s incumbent leader Paul Kagame has sealed a crushing victory in presidential elections that granted him a third term in office, extending his 17 years in power. Kagame has won international plaudits for presiding over a peaceful and rapid economic recovery in the Central African nation since the 1994 genocide, when an estimated 800,000 people Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. But he has also faced mounting censure for what critics and rights groups say are widespread human rights abuses, a muzzling of independent media and suppression of political opposition.

With 80 percent of votes accounted for, the 59-year-old former guerrilla leader secured 98.66 percent, the National Electoral Commission’s Executive secretary Charles Munyaneza told a news conference. “We expect that even if we get 100 percent of votes, there will not be any change,” he said. The board expected turnout to top 90 percent in the East African country of 12 million citizens once full details emerged, in elections that fielded only a single opposition candidate, Frank Habineza, and an independent.

Kagame, who cast his vote in Kigali’s Rugunga polling station earlier on Friday, said he would work to sustain economic growth in the tiny nation. “This is another seven years to take care of issues that affect Rwandans and ensure that we become real Rwandans who are (economically) developing,” he said in a speech broadcast live on television. Under his rule, some dissidents were killed after they fled abroad, in cases that remain unsolved. The government denies any involvement.

Kagame, a commander who led Tutsi rebel forces into Rwanda to end the 1994 genocide, banned the use of tribal terms after becoming president. He won the last election in 2010 with 93 percent of the vote and during this campaign for a further seven-year term, said he expected an outright victory.

Habineza, who has so far won 0.45 percent of the early count, had promised to set up a tribunal to retry dissidents whose convictions by Rwandan courts have been criticised as politically motivated.

Another would-be opponent, Diane Rwigara, was disqualified by the election board despite her insistence that she met all the requirements to run.

“To me I see this as a one-man race. I simply did not go to vote,” said one man in Kigali who asked not to be named.

The pro-boxing circus of India,"In addition to an overwhelming myriad of acronyms, pro boxing in India suffers from backroom politics and lack of larger-than-life prizefighters. In addition to an overwhelming myriad of acronyms, pro boxing in India suffers from backroom politics and lack of larger-than-life prizefighters.

Back in June 2015 when he announced that he was turning pro, Vijender Singh’s decision hogged all the headlines, as did his debut bout, a win over Sonny Whiting four months later. Over the next 14 months, the Olympic bronze medallist boxer maintained an unbeaten run, coasting to a professional win-loss record of 8-0.

On Saturday, when Vijender stepped into the ring, the stakes were the highest they’d ever been. He was defending the WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title while looking to take the Oriental Super Middleweight belt off China’s Zulpikaer Maimaitiali — his first undefeated opponent. Exactly who should have won the fight remains a debate for another day. But each punch that sent the Indian reeling shook the country’s nascent pro-boxing ambitions.

Vijender went the distance and walked away with the two belts. That British boxer Amir Khan believes he “hasn’t won half a major title” is a different matter altogether. After eight drab fights, the novelty was long gone for the casual viewer; to the point that a glimpse of Baba Ramdev elicited more cheers than the in-ring action during Vijender’s two fights in Delhi.

In that regard, the contentious ninth should at least fuel conversations. That it was postponed and took eight months to materialise though is worrying. Meanwhile, Vijender cut ties with Frank Warren’s Queensberry Promotions after the UK-based company shied away from putting together an overseas fight for the boxer.

Which leads us to the all-important question: if India’s biggest and most marketable star can’t sustain interest in pro boxing, what chance do the many hopefuls have?

Despite that, many an aspiring pugilist would have keenly followed every jab and hook Vijender threw on Saturday, hoping to follow in the trendsetter’s footsteps. Before any of them is able to set foot inside a ring, though, he or she will have to navigate a maze.

In addition to an overwhelming myriad of acronyms, pro boxing in India suffers from backroom politics and lack of larger-than-life prizefighters.

The first call that all boxers have to take is to move away from the system that gives them medals, cash incentives and job security. The national body, for one, believes most still choose to stay on the well-trodden path of amateur boxing. “Firstly, it is a matter of pride to represent your nation in international competition, to end up on the podium,” says Jay Kowli, general secretary of the Boxing Federation of India (BFI). “It has been applicable in the cases of Muhammad Ali to Mike Tyson. Then there’s cash prizes to be won at international events, and the kind of support that the government provides to amateur boxers, it is a great way of building a career as well.”

However, with the world body, International Boxing Association (AIBA), also giving a thrust to professional boxing in the form of AIBA Pro Boxing (APB) which facilitates pro boxers to compete at the Olympics, BFI can’t be dismissive of the alternate stream.

Kowli, however, believes, “Pro-boxing is never about producing boxers. They are not interested in promoting boxing, training people. They pick up boxers when they do well because they are just interested in big names and putting on their big shows. As far as the scene in India is concerned, everybody is free to assess. Brigadier (PK Muralidharan) Raja has his own boxing set-up. But what happened?”

What happened was, Raja — a boxing administrator who has been associated with the sport for upwards of three decades — launched his own pro boxing body Indian Boxing Council (IBC) in 2015, organised a few ‘fight nights’ and soon had to put them on hold indefinitely.

“It has not been a very happy journey so far,” Raja sums it up. “The plan was to organise around 30-40 fights nights. I was trying to put around 3-4 in a month. But I couldn’t do it all out of my retirement funds.” Raja says he had plans to promote pro boxing before there was a bandwagon to jump on. While the idea first struck him in 2010 — when Vijender was still busy preparing for the London Olympics — Raja put in the homework during the last three years.

“I went all around the world to study this. I met promoters, bought books, studied the formats,” says Raja, former secretary general of the now-defunct national federation IABF. “The gameplan was simple. We needed to build the fighters. Give them fights, build their record. Once the good ones get filtered, we would get them national titles, then Asian, World. So, I put in whatever money I had, thinking once it picks up, people will come in. The people who did come in, didn’t have money themselves.”

While he is not out of the game yet — “IBC is willing to conduct technical operations” — putting together any more fight nights without a promoter is out of the question.

“We want it to happen. But I’ve spent close to Rs1 crore myself. My team can still help with the referees, judges, doctors and setting up the fights. If anybody wants to come on board as a promoter, the profit is theirs to keep.”

MANY BODIES, MANY MINDS

Jay Kowli clarifies that “I’m not happy when anything goes wrong because it is my sport.” While he wouldn’t comment on the ongoing Super Boxing League (SBL), other than wishing them luck, Kowli believes plans eventually go sour without proper streamlining. “Because I’m coming from an organised system, I would like these set-ups to be accountable and answerable for everything. Otherwise, I feel it is very risky for boxing.”

As of now, there are multiple organisations and little streamlining. SBL — the second venture of promoter Bill Dosanjh after the MMA promotion Super Fight League — kicked off in July without much fanfare or the backing of the powers that be. Not that it bothers Dosanjh.

“At the end of the day, it’s best that it’s done by people who understand the sport,” Dosanjh told The Indian Express. “Me and Amir Khan understand the sport better than any federation set up in India. (BFI President) Ajay Singh is a chairman of SpiceJet, running a very successful business, but he doesn’t understand the sport. He has a special job at hand to build the fighters for the Olympics. We are here to help them turn pro with this exciting format.”

The format however reminds one of the old adage: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. What essentially is a sport of two people punching each other in the face has been twisted into a team competition, with six fighters per side fighting four 3-minute rounds and different number of points awarded to different finishes.

Raja explains: “League concept is not for boxing. It has been tried before by Don King in the 70s. The people trying to do it are thinking they’ll cash in on the mushrooming of leagues and sell franchises. At the end of the day, everybody will be taken for a ride. How are the franchises going to recover the money?”

“Bill has the money. But I don’t think these guys are here to develop things. They are not from India. Outsiders coming to India thinking they will get something with these one-off events is not what professional boxing needs. All of these small groups need to get together and make one consolidated effort. Currently everything is fragmented.”

Too many cooks spoil the pie, more so when each is in a hurry for a slice. India has a number of underground pro boxing bodies affiliated to organisations such as World Boxing Council (WBC), World Boxing Association (WBA) and World Boxing Organisation (WBO).

In addition to Raja’s IBC, there is the Professional Boxing Organisation of India (PBOI) which is overseeing the SBL. That the body’s general secretary Kunal Goyat’s brother Neeraj took part in the league, without an NOC from his employer Railways, adds to the convoluted mess. Then there’s Jai Shekhawat of Royal Sports Promotions and North India Boxing Association (NIBA) who alleges that the PBOI has breached an exclusivity deal by signing up with SBL, leaving his pro boxing league stuck in the pipeline.

There’s also the Indian Pro Boxing Association (IPBA), the president of which, Shahe Ali promises yet another league later this year, albeit one “on par with the IPL, to sell out the JLN and Indira Gandhi stadiums.” They sure have their task cut out, seeing how the Facebook page is still inviting donations. The group claims that it has also successfully invited Evander Holyfield to India to promote their league on Twitter, but have nothing more than the heavyweight legend’s retweets to cite.

Shekhawat, Ali and the elder Goyat were responsible for one of India’s earliest forays into professional boxing — a fight night in a Delhi mall two years back which launched Neeraj’s pro career. However, the infighting and the branching out stunted the growth of the sport. So what’s the solution?

“I would prefer a professional body set up under the federation,” says Kowli. “When the national federation runs pro boxing, the boxers will have more reason to be secure and in safe hands. The BFI is already working on a professional boxing programme of our own, to streamline everything. It’s in the final stages.” Exactly what BFI plans to do with professional boxing remains a mystery. Meanwhile, some boxers who won laurels as amateurs, be it a national championship (Kuldeep Singh) or a Commonwealth Games bronze medal (Amandeep Singh), have taken the plunge and turned pro without waiting for BFI to clarify its intentions. Like the younger Goyat, Kuldeep and Amandeep also ran into trouble with the Railways for taking part in the SBL.

CHARACTER-BUILDING

Another odd stacked against pro boxing in India is that it is trying to take off when the sport has cooled off globally. The trash-talking draws of yesteryear are now few and far between. The ones who do crop up are plucked by MMA promotions. Closer home, Vijender remains the only semblance of a draw. Neerav Tomar — head of IOS Boxing Promotions that has organised Vijender’s three home fights — admits that they need to look beyond the sole flag-bearer.

“Everything is on Vijender’s shoulders. Right now, it is just his stardom and success that we are capitalising on. At least till the time we find a new star,” says Tomar, adding that the 31-year-old is “still five or six fights away from a world title”. Former light-welterweight world champion and Athens silver-medallist Amir Khan offers a more candid assessment.

“Vijender has not made a big noise,” the 30-year-old told The Indian Express. “He hasn’t won a major title, or even half a major title, which will make people regard him as a good fighter.” The PR-driven, sanitised machine around Vijender hasn’t helped him develop an outlandish persona either, and the boxer himself has gone on record saying that “my conscience doesn’t allow me to talk trash.”

An exciting breakout is the need of the hour, and Brigadier Raja believes it could be a woman, citing 2014 CWG bronze medallist Sarita Devi as an example. Earlier this year, in front of a raucous crowd in her hometown Imphal, Sarita pummeled Hungarian Zsofia Bedo in her pro debut, only to return to the amateur fold soon after.

“I’m telling you, what we saw that night, she could be a world champion in 6-12 months. Same for Pinki Jangra. Unfortunately, I brought them here but couldn’t get further fights. So I talked to Mr Ajay Singh and told him that these girls are still the best in the country. I told him that let them be in the fray for the upcoming Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. And once they’re done, with your permission, they can return to pro boxing.”

Both Sarita and Pinki had to submit letters of apology to the federation, but Raja believes it was for the better. “I would also give priority to amateur boxing. Asian Games, Olympics is something special.”

Neeraj Goyat, however, wants to make his mark as a professional boxer. He came close too. The 25-year-old took part in AIBA’s Olympic qualifiers in Venezuela last year but fell one win short of booking a Rio berth. “Amateur is important as you have to go to the nursery class to get to a college,” says Goyat, who defended his WBC-ABC welterweight title on Saturday.

“But nobody remembers amateur boxers. Mike Tyson is famous because he was professional. Muhammad Ali wasn’t popular because of his Olympic medal. Boxing ka naam professionals ki wajah se hi chalta hai.”

Watching Shankersinh Vaghela,"Shankersinh Vaghela (Express Photo by Javed Raja) Shankersinh Vaghela (Express Photo by Javed Raja)

Vasant Vagdo, the palatial home of Shankersinh Vaghela in Gandhinagar that’s spread over a sprawling 5.2 acres, holds the key to the Rajya Sabha elections to be held on August 8. That date will also decide the course Vaghela’s political career will take as Gujarat’s 176 MLAs vote for the three Rajya Sabha seats from the state. For now, as a cloak-and-dagger battle plays out in the form of defections and the whisking away of the Congress’s 44 MLAs to a resort in Karnataka, Vaghela isn’t revealing his cards.

Waiting outside Vasant Vagdo — the building is said to be modelled on the Capitol, the seat of the US Congress in Washington DC — are a group of politicians, among them a Congress MLA and Vaghela’s son Mahendrasinh who are are among the seven who have not joined the 44 Congress MLAs at the Bengaluru resort.

Only days earlier, on July 21, on his 77th birthday, Vaghela had quit the Congress after an association of nearly 20 years, but remained an MLA so that he could vote for elections to the Upper House. His resignation came soon after the Congress realised that nearly eight of its 57 MLAs had voted in favour of NDA’s presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind. (Of the Congress’s 57 MLAs, six resigned after Vaghela quit the party and three of them joined the BJP. Of the 50 remaining Congress MLAs, excluding Vaghela, 44 are in Bangalore and seven MLAs have stayed back in Gujarat.)

As he announced that he was quitting, Vaghela made it clear that he was not joining any political party but was “not quitting politics either”. As he sits in the living room that’s adorned with ornate souvenirs and black-and-white photographs from his RSS days, Vaghela, the man credited for splitting the BJP in 1995 by engineering a coup and flying nearly 55 MLAs to Madhya Pradesh, then ruled by Congress’s Digvijay Singh, is today critical of the Congress fortaking a similar route.

“They (the MLAs) should have been here in their constituencies with their voters in their time of grief, ” he says. Banaskantha, the district in north Gujarat that’s among the worst-hit in the recent floods, is where the Congress holds six of the nine assembly seats. In public, Vaghela has claimed that his vote is reserved for Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi who is seeking re-election to the Rajya Sabha for a fifth term, but the six resignations of Congress MLAs after him, have already spelt trouble for Patel. Three of them joined the BJP, of whom Balwantsinh Rajput, the former chief whip of the Congress, was seen as an “Ahmed Patel man”. The BJP was quick to field him as its third candidate for the Rajya Sabha.

So now, there are four candidates for three seats in Gujarat, Amit Shah and Smriti Irani being the other two BJP candidates, leading to a contest for the Rajya Sabha — the first since 1996. Rajput’s son is married to Vaghela’s granddaughter and Vaghela is expected to put all his might behind him. In which case, the contest could turn into an Irani vs Patel one, says a Congress source. Back in 1995, when Vaghela broke away from the BJP, his Rashtriya Janata Party (RJP) had formed a government with support from the Congress, for which he still thanks Ahmed Patel.

“He is a very liberal man, a saint-like man, loyal to Madam Gandhi,” he says, breaking into a smile and adding, “He also plays billiards. (Like in the game) in politics, he targets the white and the red falls.”

The Congress has 44 MLAs in Bengaluru and the party needs 45 votes for Ahmed Patel to win. Sources say at least three of the six Banaskantha MLAs in the Bengaluru resort threw a tantrum, asking to be sent back to their constituencies, but were not allowed. AICC spokesperson and MLA Shaktsinh Gohil, who has a good “personal rapport” with Vaghela and is herding the 44 MLAs in Bengaluru, denies this and says the MLAs “are all together”.

Though Vaghela insists he is “not in touch with any of the Congress MLAs”, with the arithmetic for the Rajya Sabha going down to the wire, he is one man, the Congress realises, who can make or break the party’s chances.

Vaghela, on his part, has never hid his disenchantment with the Congress. Even while there were rumours about his joining the BJP, on March 30, he hosted BJP president Amit Shah in the state assembly building, in his office of Leader of Opposition.

This was followed by a meeting of at least 20 Congress MLAs at his home, where they told then Gujarat in-charge, Gurudas Kamat, that Vaghela should be projected as the chief ministerial candidate. The Congress high command did not agree and instead, replaced Kamat with Ashok Gehlot. The unease with the party high command continued as Vaghela’s face disappeared from Congress posters and, as he alleged, in one instance, his name was struck off a memorandum to the Gujarat governor in which he was a signatory.

Vaghela claims he quit the Congress because the party was “not interested in winning elections”. “For me, the public comes first, followed by the party and then the individual. But in the Congress, it is the individual first and then the party; the public is completely missing,” says Vaghela, adding “general secretaries have all the say (instead of local leaders)”.

The BJP was quick to react to Vaghela’s quitting, with its state chief Jitu Vaghani wishing him on his birthday. State BJP spokesperson Bharat Pandya says, “The Congress ignored Vaghela, did not listen to him and displayed no faith in him. It did not care to listen to its MLAs and instead, engaged in a fight over who should control the party. Even when its MLAs were quitting, the party did nothing.”

Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Congress MLA says, “Leaders like Ahmedbhai feed reports to Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, but the situation on ground could be very different. How can a party plan for elections this way?”

The Congress, however, says the party gave Vaghela a free hand. A senior Congress leader who spoke on condition of anonymity says, “Vaghela was too self-centred. According to me, he added no value to the Congress in all these years. He may have oratory skills, but they do not always translate into votes”. He points out that how, despite his RSS roots, the Congress made Vaghela Gujarat PCC chief in 2002 and later, Union minister and Opposition leader. He was also made campaign convenor for the 2012 elections (after he complained about the party being ill-prepared for the Assembly elections).

In the Lok Sabha elections of 2004, of the 12 Congress MPs, four were from the Vaghela camp, including Madhusudan Mistry, who is now a key member of Rahul’s team. While the Congress accuses him of projecting himself as the chief ministerial candidate, Vaghela, at least for the record, announced earlier this year that “he was not in the CM race”. But around this time, there was also a Facebook page heralding him as CM and listing out the achievements of his earlier RJP government. That, many say, is Vaghela for you. Both his supporters and critics agree that it’s not easy to put Vaghela in a box.

In 2002, when Vaghela was declared PCC chief, a huge welcome rally was staged at Ahmedabad railway station to make it seem as if he came by train, though he had flown in from Delhi. So it was when he announced on July 21 that he had been expelled from the Congress “24 hours earlier”, leaving the AICC scrambling to issue a denial.

A top Congress leader who is also an MLA says, “I was all along with Bapu (as Vaghela’s supporters call him)… but he should have held on, maybe he could have become chief minister because Congress stands a strong chance this time.” One of Vaghela’s reasons for quitting the BJP in 1995 was his open animosity towards Narendra Modi that coincided with the latter’s growing clout in the party. Until Modi came in, Vaghela was the state BJP’s power centre, a status he hoped to retain as he moved to the Congress. But that was unthinkable in a party that swore by the high command.

“I was president in Congress (he was GPCC chief in 2002) but in BJP, I was was the maalik (lord). Nobody dared interfere in my decision. I never asked Advani or Vajpayee before taking a decision… but all that was before Modi. Today everything is between Modi and Amitbhai,” says Vaghela, adding that it’s the “same problem” in the Congress.

In the 2002 election, Vaghela wanted the campaigning to be left to local leaders, but the Congress flew in six of its chief ministers, all of whom spoke of Godhra incident and the riots that followed, playing straight into the BJP’s hands. In the 2012 election, with talk of Rahul talking over from Sonia as party chief, Vaghela warned against the contest turning into a “Rahul vs Modi” battle, but that was exactly what happened.

With another election coming up, the Congress is talking about restricting the campaign to local leaders, but Vaghela says “it’s too late”. As Opposition leader, Vaghela had said last year that the Congress would decide its candidates a year in advance, saying the party did not do well in 2012 because 28 of its candidates were changed at the last minute.

The party still hasn’t announced candidates. “If we declare our candidates, the rest of the time will be spent in pulling them down,” says a Congress leader. His supporters say that Vaghela, who has won many of the Lok Sabha and Assembly seats since he first contested in 1977 from Mehsana, still has it in him to swing some Kshatriya and OBC votes – he is a Rajput from Vasan village in Gandhinagar district.

“Bapu is the only politician in Gujarat today to have contested from at least five constituencies for different parties. He is the only mass leader,” says Congress MLA Raghavji Patel, who was the only Congress MLA, besides his son Mahendrasinh, to have turned up for Vaghela’s birthday. Patel, who represents Jamnagar (Rural) seat, is among the six MLAs besides Vaghela, who have not gone to Bengaluru. “I am ambitious. We did not join politics to take sanyas, so we have to decide what to do next,” he says.

Vaghela admits that while in the Congress, many of his supporters such as Vitthal Radadiya and Jasha Barad quit the party and that he did nothing to stop them. “I never held back anyone. I had nothing to promise them in the Congress so I set them free, but there were some who went back to without my knowledge,” says Vaghela. Jasha Barad, who was in the RJP and followed Vaghela to the Congress, returned to the BJP in 2012. Now minister of state for Water Supply and Civil Aviation in the Vijay Rupani government, Barad says, “Vaghela is a mass leader. I think his decision to quit the Congress was wise. He is, after all, of the old RSS mould.” Tejashree Patel, former Congress MLA from Viramgam who quit after Vaghela and is now with the BJP, says, “Bapu is a grassroots leader. I would say that in Gujarat, he has a fan following of his own, even outside the political party.”

Though she insists that her exit from the party “should not be connected to Vaghela’s” and that she left because of the “disorganized ways” of the Congress, she later admits that “the quitting a leader of Vaghela’s stature was definitely a motivator”. His critics, however, blame Vaghela for not being able to revive the Congress in the state.

The party’s traditional strategy in Gujarat has been to consolidate the Kshatriya, Harijan (Dalit), Adivasi, Muslim (KHAM) communities, isolating the Patidars, who were known to be BJP supporters. But after Modi’s exit from Gujarat, the Patidars and Dalits turned against the BJP and in the local elections that followed the Patidar agitation of December 2015, the Congress won 20 of the 31 district panchayats and wrested at least six taluka panchayats from the BJP. Many of these bodies are now back in the BJP.

To those who say he did not make any attempt to reach out to these communities, Vaghela only says, “It is too early to count on them (the movements against BJP)”.

Though he is now a man without a party, Vaghela isn’t resting yet and is even meticulously chalking out itineraries. Days after he quit the Congress, he went on a tour of the flood-hit districts of Banaskantha and Patan, where he drew sizeable crowds as he met farmers and spoke to villagers in refugee camps. Given his political standing, sources in the Congress say, he can hold sway over at least 10-15 seats, mostly in north and central Gujarat. Back at Vasant Vagdo, while discussing his future plans, Vaghela says, “I have always got offers from the BJP. Even in the 2014 election, they said, ‘pick any seat’. But I have personal reasons for not going to BJP”. Ask him about the options ahead of him and he says, preparing to get up, “Everything will be decided after August 8″.

Five RSS men acquitted in killing of 2 Muslims,"Representational Image Representational Image

THE INDORE bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court has acquitted five RSS activists who were sentenced to life imprisonment for killing two Muslims on December 30, 2007. The attack, an alleged retaliation, came a day after the murder of former RSS pracharak Sunil Joshi.

Rasheed Shah, 65, was hacked to death and his son Jaleel, 27, was attacked with acid in Sutarkheda village in Dewas district, about 40 km from Indore. Jaleel died of burns on January 11 at an Indore hospital, where two of his brothers, severely injured in the same attack, were also treated.

While several people were accused in the case, no one else was arrested besides the five, who have now been acquitted. Wanted for his role in a twin-murder, Joshi was hiding in Chuna Khadan locality of Dewas when he was killed on the evening of December 29, 2007. Hindutva organisations had blamed his murder on “anti-national elements like SIMI’’ and called for a bandh on December 30 — the day Rasheed’s family was attacked.

Joshi’s murder had remained unsolved before sleuths said he was killed by his own men. The NIA and state police arrested two different sets of accused — Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur’s name figured in both lists of accused. After a long trial, the Dewas sessions court acquitted all the accused.

On July 31, 2009, while Joshi’s murder was still a mystery, the sessions court in Dewas sentenced Bhanwar Singh, 25; Mahipal Singh, 21; Omprakash, 23; Jaswant Singh, 24; and Rajpal Singh, 19, to life imprisonment relying on the dying declaration of Jaleel, who knew the accused because they lived in nearby villages.

Arguing that they had been implicated because of their RSS identity, the five challenged the verdict in the Indore bench of High Court. “We disproved the dying declaration and proved the alibi that the accused had gone to Pachmarhi (a hill station in Madhya Pradesh), and were not in Sutarkheda at the time of the incident,’’ defence lawyer Pradip Gupta told The Sunday Express.

Jaleel’s elder brother Latif Shah said the family will challenge the order.

New eruption at Indonesia volcano spreads ash for miles,"Residents ride in a truck as Mount Sinabung releases pyroclastic flows during its eruption in Karo, North Sumatra, Indonesia, Wednesday, Aug. 2, 2017. (AP Photo) Residents ride in a truck as Mount Sinabung releases pyroclastic flows during its eruption in Karo, North Sumatra, Indonesia, Wednesday, Aug. 2, 2017. (AP Photo)

Mount Sinabung on the Indonesian island of Sumatra blasted volcanic ash as high as 4.2 kilometers (2.6 miles) on Wednesday, one of its biggest eruptions in the past several months of high activity. Isya Nurrahmat Dana, an official at a volcano monitoring post in North Sumatra province, said at least 19 eruptions followed by lava flows were recorded by midday Wednesday.

Hot ash tumbled down the mountain’s slopes as far as 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) east and southeast into the Labortus River. Media reports said students from an elementary school in Kuta Rakyat were sent home because volcanic ash covering the village was considered dangerous. There were no reports of casualties.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said thousands of people in 10 villages were directly affected by ash fall from the latest eruption. He warned villagers to stay out of a danger zone that extends as far as 7 kilometers (4.4 miles) from the peak. Nugroho said villagers urgently need face masks and clean water.

He called on people to be vigilant about the possibility of flash floods and lava flows because Wednesday’s eruption created a natural dam on the upper reaches of the Laborus River. The 2,460-meter (8,070-foot) high Sinabung burst back to life in 2010 after a long period of dormancy. The volcano has been erupting sporadically ever since, killing 17 people and forcing more than 30,000 to evacuate their villages.

Mumbai: One held for sexually abusing two boys in Vile Parle,"A bus cleaner was arrested by the police in Vile Parle on Saturday for allegedly sexually assaulting two boys, who are brothers. (Representational Image) A bus cleaner was arrested by the police in Vile Parle on Saturday for allegedly sexually assaulting two boys, who are brothers. (Representational Image)

A bus cleaner was arrested by the police in Vile Parle on Saturday for allegedly sexually assaulting two boys, who are brothers, repeatedly over a period of time. The abuse came to light when the boys, aged 10 and 12, told a teacher in their school in Santacruz on Friday about the abuse. The police said that the accused, who is 35 years old, lives in the same building in Vile Parle East as the boys.

An officer at Vile Parle police station said that the accused lured one of the boys to his home after promising to give him chocolates. The official added that after some time, the accused began to abuse the other boy after luring him to his home. “The accused is their neighbour and would visit their home very often even as he sexually assaulted the boys on several occasions,” said the officer. The police said the boys’ parents were unaware of the abuse.

An FIR was registered by the school authorities at Santacruz police station and the case was later transferred to Vile Parle as the crime was committed there. The cleaner has been booked for unnatural sex under the Indian Penal Code and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, the police said.

Dutee Chand says she is living under constant fear of being banned,"Athletics Federation of India banned Dutee Chand in 2014 under this policy but she challenged AFI’s decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sports. (Source: File) Athletics Federation of India banned Dutee Chand in 2014 under this policy but she challenged AFI’s decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sports. (Source: File)

When it comes to deal with sensitive gender cases, India’s sprinter Dutee Chand feels that she might have to face a ban, and she also fears that under international athletics federation’s policy, her career might finish early.

“There is tremendous pressure on me because of the case going on in CAS. I am not being able to focus on my training because of that case,” Dutee told PTI.

International Association of Athletics Federations have a Hyperandrogenism policy which says that female athletes who naturally produce high levels of testosterone cannot be allowed to compete on the ground.

Athletics Federation of India banned Dutee in 2014 under this policy but she challenged AFI’s decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sports in Lausanne, Switzerland.

In July 2015, the AFI’s ban was overturned by CAS and IAAF’s hyperandrogenism policy was suspended for two years. The world’s top sports tribunal said that IAAF’s policy will not be considered as legal if they are unable to provide any factual evidence that ‘female athletes who naturally produce high levels of testosterone have an unfair advantage.’

During that two year period, Dutee continued to compete for both national and international events. But her future again seems uncertain after IAAF’s decision last month to submit fresh evidence at the CAS in support of its previous policy.

The CAS, on July 27, again put a suspension on the controversial policy of the IAAF for two months until September and Dutee was allowed to participate in the World Championships. She did not get an automatic berth after not being able to touch the qualifying standard of 11.2 secs but got a late quota entry as the targeted number of 56 in the women’s 100m dash was not reached.

“I was thinking if this case comes back, whether I will be able to run again or not. I was thinking that I can be banned or something like that can happen. I was always under the constant fear that I can be banned and then how I will I run. Despite training so hard throughout the year, what is the use if I am banned.”, Dutee said.

Dutee finished sixth in heat number five of the women’s 100m first round, clocking a below-par 12.07 secs. She performed below her season’s best of 11.30 seconds. Out of the 47 athletes competing in the event, she finished 38th.

“But I have got the chance to run at such a big event and in front of such a big crowd. The whole of India is watching on television and supporting me. I feel happy about representing the country.”, the 21-year-old Odisha girl added.

On being asked about her mental state while facing this ‘gender’ issue, she said, “There was to be a hearing on July 24 at the CAS. I was really broken during the Asian Championships (July 6-9) in Bhubaneswar because of this case.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been taking a three-day fishing and hunting summer holiday Siberian wilderness, where he opted to be shirtless and brave the cold waters of a mountain lake. Pictures and video footage released by the Kremlin on Saturday showed Putin spear-fishing, swimming and sunbathing alongside Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. The hunting and fishing expedition took place on Aug. 1-3 in the republic of Tyva in southern Siberia, on the Mongolian border, some 3,700 km (2,300 miles) east of Moscow.

“The water in the lake doesn’t get warmer than 17 degrees, but this didn’t stop the president from going for a swim,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday.

JNUTA to hold ‘khali classroom’ lectures,"Students are upset with the ‘imposition’ of Hindi. Archive Students are upset with the ‘imposition’ of Hindi. Archive

The Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) has decided to organise a “Khaali Classroom lecture series” in the current semester, as part of its sustained campaign against the administration. The lectures will be taught by faculty members from Centres and Schools which haven’t had a single admission in MPhil and PhD this year. The JNUTA had earlier organised two lectures series — on nationalism and Azaadi — in the aftermath of the February 9 controversy when students were booked for sedition for allegedly shouting anti-national slogans.

The JNUTA will also frame a “detailed chargesheet” against the vice-chancellor and his team. The decisions were taken at a general body meeting of the JNUTA on August 1. “The JNUTA GBM resolves to undertake a sustained campaign in the Monsoon semester in defence of teachers’ rights as employees, the JNU Act, Constitutional values and the realisation of Constitutional provisions for reservation, the restoration of admissions to JNU’s research programmes, and the many other issues that plague the university today,” the JNUTA said in a statement.

“The JNUTA meeting resolves to frame and publicise a detailed chargesheet that demonstrates the myriad failures of the JNU V-C and his team in managing the affairs of the university,” it added.

Speaking about the lecture series, JNUTA president Kidwai said, “The series will be taught by the Centres, Schools, Special Centres – whose research programmes have had zero admissions in the 2017-18 academic year. It will most probably be held after August 14, at several places across the campus.” A march in defence of teachers’ rights is also scheduled on August 8. JNU had seen a massive cut in seats for MPhil and PhD this year after the implementation of the 2016 UGC gazette notification which stipulates an upper limit on how many students a teacher can guide.

Indian golfer Arjun Atwal overcame a poor start and some late hiccups before a birdie on the final saved him from an early exit at the Barracuda

Championship.

Atwal, who had six points in the first round and four more in second, made it on the cut line. Meanwhile, Richy Werenski birdied six holes and eagled No. 18 to take a two-point lead.

The 25-year-old American had a 15-point round to reach 26 points for two trips around the high-altitude course at Montreux Golf and Country Club.

The scoring system awards eight points for double eagle, five points for an eagle, two points for a birdie and deducts a point for a bogey and three points for a double bogey or worse.

Stuart Appleby sits alone in second after a six-birdie, two-bogey round. Greg Owen, Luke List, Ben Marti and Dicky Pride are all tied for third at 23 points. First-round leader John Huh dropped into a tie for 19th with 16 points.

Play was delayed for more than an hour due to rain and lightning in the area.

Pakistani Embassy given consular access to 64-year-old convict in drug peddling case,"Iqbal was arrested by Aligarh police in 2001 and 2007 under NDPS Act. (File Photo) Iqbal was arrested by Aligarh police in 2001 and 2007 under NDPS Act. (File Photo)

The Pakistani Embassy in New Delhi has been allowed counsellor access to a native of Karachi, who had been convicted in two cases of drug peddling and is at present facing trial in a similar case in Aligarh. The Aligarh District Jail, where Iqbal has been lodged since 2012, had only last year found out that the 64-year-old was a Pakistani citizen. Till then, whenever Iqbal had been arrested or lodged in jail, he had pretended to be an Indian citizen by providing the police and the jail authorities his Indian addresses.

After the Aligarh jail came to know about his nationality, the state prison department intimated the Union Ministry of Home Affairs last year, which further informed the Pakistani Embassy. “We came to know about Iqbal being a Pakistani national after receiving a letter from the Aligarh police. We informed the MHA through the prisons headquarters in Lucknow,” said Agra DIG (Prisons) Sharad Kulshestra.

“Recently, we received a letter from the MHA, forwarded by the prisons headquarters, asking us to send Iqbal to Tihar Jail in Delhi on August 28 for a counsellor access with Pakistani Embassy officials. A letter has now been sent to officials to provide police security to send Iqbal to Delhi,” he added. Aligarh’s Local Intelligence Unit (LIU) Inspector Anil Kumar said Iqbal had been staying in India on “long term visa” since his childhood. “He used to visit the LIU office every year for extension of the visa. After he was booked and arrested, Iqbal stopped visiting the LIU office and we started a hunt for him. Last year, we found him lodged in Aligarh District Jail. A report was later sent to the jail administration, informing that Iqbal is a native of Karachi,” he added.

Kumar said Iqbal’s father Abdul Sattar alias Raffaq was an Indian citizen. “According to our records, Iqbal came to India in 1955 along with his mother Bundo Begum and elder brother Anwaar. Iqbal was then two years old and came to India on his mother’s passport,” he added. “Bundo Begum received Indian citizenship in 1968 and two years later, she died in India. We do not have any record of Abdul Sattar,” said Kumar. He added that both Iqbal and Anwaar had been staying in Aligarh on a “long term visa”, which has to be renewed

every year.

“After 1990, Anwaar went missing and is yet to be traced. But Iqbal used to get his visa extended from Aligarh’s LIU office every year. However, he stopped coming for visa extension a few years ago and was found in Aligarh jail,” said Kumar.

According to records, Iqbal was arrested by Aligarh police in 2001 and 2007 under NDPS Act. After being released on bail, he was arrested again in January, 2010 by the Nainital police in Uttarakhand on charges of drug peddling.

In 2010, Iqbal was sentenced to five-years imprisonment in the 2001 case. In 2011, a local court in Nainital handed him 10-years imprisonment in the 2010 case. After his conviction in Nainital, Iqbal was sent back to Aligarh jail to face trial in another pending case. “Iqbal is facing trial in another case under NDPS Act lodged at City Kotwali police station in Aligarh in 2007. We have letter to the Nainital jail authorities asking for details about Iqbal,” said an official in Aligarh jail.

"Looking forward to serve the nation, says Niti Aayog Vice Chairman elect Rajiv Kumar","Vice Chairman of Niti Aayog, Rajiv Kumar. (File/Photo) Vice Chairman of Niti Aayog, Rajiv Kumar. (File/Photo)

Noted economist Rajiv Kumar on Sunday said he is looking forward to serve the country as the new Vice Chairman of Niti Aayog. “Look forward to serve the nation with my role @nitiaayog @pmoindia,” Kumar tweeted. He was named the new Vice chairman of the government think-tank on Saturday, five days after the incumbent Arvind Panagariya announced that he would quit to return academia. Kumar, who holds a DPhil in economics from Oxford and a PhD from Lucknow University, is a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR).

Earlier, he was Secretary General of industry chamber FICCI and had also served as Director and Chief Executive of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER).

He was a member of the National Security Advisory Board between 2006 and 2008.

He has also served as chief economist of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and has held senior positions in the the Asian Development Bank, the Ministry of Industries and the Ministry of Finance.

Kumar is also on boards of several international and national institutions, including the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center in Riyadh, the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and Asia in Jakarta, the State Bank of India, and the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.

The appointment for the post of Niti Aayog Vice Chairman was necessitated as the incumbent Panagariya on August 1 had announced that he will leave the government think-tank on August 31 and return to Columbia University.

Panagariya, an Indian-American, had joined the Niti Aayog in January 2015.

(Source: Reuters) Ravindra Jadeja who also became the fastest left arm bowler to reach 150 wickets in test matches. (Source: Reuters)

Much like the first two days of cricket in the second Test between India and Sri Lanka, day three witnessed history being rewritten as several records were shattered and new ones came up to take their place. On a day when the visitors once again dominated proceedings in the first part of the day, what stood out were the fighting knocks by Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne. After being enforced with the follow-on, it seemed like India might finish the match early but the duo of Mendis and Karunaratne kept the hosts in the hunt. Courtesy of this the Sri Lanka team made a strong comeback into the match. This was after R Ashwin bagged yet another five wicket haul and spun a web around the Lankan batsman to dismiss them for a paltry 183 at the end of first day’s play. However, that was not all as more numbers were rewritten. Herein we bring you a few of them.

Off-spinner R Ashwin wrote his name in history books when he bagged yet another five-for in the first innings of the second match against Sri Lanka in Colombo. This was Ashwin’s 26th five-wicket haul in Test match cricket. With this, he surpassed Harbhajan Singh’s record and is now only behind Anil Kumble who has 35 five wicket hauls to his name.

Complementing him well was Ravindra Jadeja who also became the quickest left arm bowler to reach 150 wickets in test matches.

Meanwhile, Kusal Mendis also became the youngest Lankan batsman to score a hundred after his team was enforced with the follow-on. However, after being dismissed on 110 Mendis became the third batsmen to be dismissed twice on the same day in a home Test. Among the highest second wicket stands for Sri Lanka against India Karunaratne-Mendis recorded the second best when they put up 191.

Tensions between India-China could cast a shadow over upcoming BRICS summit,"Most previous standoffs, such as one in 2014 just ahead of a rare trip to India for Xi, were resolved with both sides withdrawing their forces. (Representational image) Most previous standoffs, such as one in 2014 just ahead of a rare trip to India for Xi, were resolved with both sides withdrawing their forces. (Representational image)

China is taking an increasingly tough line on a border row with India amid a rising crescendo of nationalism in state media, and President Xi Jinping looks set for an awkward encounter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a multilateral summit next month. Diplomats say Beijing would like to resolve the border issue before a summit of the BRICS nations – that also groups Brazil, Russia and South Africa – in the Chinese city of Xiamen in early September, and ensure nothing dampens what China wants to be a show of cooperation and friendship among developing countries. But that could be tough.

On Wednesday, China ramped up the rhetoric, accusing India of “concocting” excuses over the illegal entry of the South Asian nation’s military into Chinese territory. “China will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate and lawful rights and interests,” the Foreign Ministry said.

The two sides’ troops are confronting each other close to a valley controlled by China that separates India from its close ally, Bhutan, and gives China access to the so-called Chicken’s Neck, a thin strip of land connecting India and its remote northeastern regions.

Responding, India reiterated an earlier line that work by a Chinese road crew in the sensitive frontier area would have changed the status quo and urging “utmost restraint” by all sides. “India considers that peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas is an important pre-requisite for smooth development of our bilateral relations with China,” New Delhi’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday evening.

Most previous standoffs, such as one in 2014 just ahead of a rare trip to India for Xi, were resolved with both sides withdrawing their forces. There has been no shooting since a brief border war in 1962. Talks are happening behind the scenes, but with little apparent progress.

Meantime, Chinese and India media have been taking a strident approach, with a Chinese state-run newspaper last week saying China could use force. An Indian magazine’s front cover last month showing a map of China shorn of Tibet and self-ruled Taiwan also ignited public anger on Chinese social media with thousands of angry posts. “The problem is the media on both sides are whipping things up. This makes it hard for China or India to back down,” said a Beijing-based source who is familiar with the discussions between the two sides.

The Indian government has asked political parties to refrain from politicising the issue and allow diplomacy to work.

“SHOW WHAT WE ARE MADE OF”

China’s defence ministry last week also warned India not to harbour any illusions about the Chinese military’s ability to defend its territory. A source with ties to the military, who spoke recently to a senior Chinese officer involved in the stand off, said China has no appetite for conflict with India but could not be seen to be weak. “Nobody wants to fight about this, but if India keeps making trouble then we’ll have to show them what we’re made of,” the source said, citing the conversation with the senior officer.

China has repeatedly called on India to withdraw its forces. An Indian government source closely tracking the standoff said there was no change in the ground situation in Doklam, with the two sides remaining in a standoff.

Indian military expert Nitin Gokhale said India was prepared for a long haul. “The decision is to stay resolute on the ground and reasonable in diplomacy,” Gokhale said.

China has been briefing foreign diplomats on the stand off, saying it wants a resolution but that its patience won’t last for ever. “There’s no easy solution,” said an Asian diplomat, who attended a briefing, referring to both sides’ insistence that they are in the right.

For the time being, China looks ready to keep things calm, said another Asian diplomat, familiar with China’s thinking on the issue. “China really wants to resolve this ahead of the BRICS summit. It doesn’t want anything to affect the atmosphere,” the diplomat said. “The gloves could come off after the summit though.”

China and India have long been suspicious of each other, a legacy of the 1962 border war, India’s playing host to exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and China’s close relations with India’s regional rival Pakistan.

India has privately raised objections to Chinese firm Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group’s proposed $1.3 billion takeover of Indian drugmaker Gland Pharma, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Ajit Doval, India’s national security adviser, visited Beijing last week for a BRICS security meeting, and had bilateral talks with his Chinese opposite number, top diplomat Yang Jiechi, who outranks the foreign minister. A Chinese government statement on that meeting did not mention the border issue.

China and India are already suspicious of each other because of China’s massive investments in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, including Chinese-invested ports in both countries India fears could one day become Chinese military bases, another senior Asian diplomatic source said.

“Nobody wants to get caught in the middle of this,” the diplomat said, pointing to the prospect for the border tensions worsening and becoming a wider Asian security issue dragging in other countries.

A single track from Malayalam Superstar Mohanlal’s Velipadinte Pusthakam was released on Sunday. The single, Eantammede Jimikki Kammal, has been sung by Vineeth Sreenivasan and Renjith Unni. The song has lyrics by Anil Panachooran with music by Shaan Rahman. A light-hearted and funny number, the track also takes some sly digs at moral policing.

The veteran actor recently completed shooting for the movie, which is expected to be released this Onam. The film is expected to clash with Mammootty’s Pullikkaran Staraa at the box office. Coincidentally, both superstars will be essaying the role of a professor in their movies.

Velipadinte Pusthakam is being helmed by Lal Jose and is produced by Antony Perumbavoor. The film also stars Angamaly Diaries fame Ann Reshma Rajan as the female lead. Interestingly in a career spanning 19 years, Lal Jose is working with the veteran Malayalam actor for the first time in this film. The movie is touted to be Lal Jose’s dream project and was extensively shot at the St Xavier’s College campus in Thiruvananthapuram.

Mohanlal plays a vice-principal named Michael Idikkula, who is known for his unconventional teaching methods. The character is nicknamed ‘Dracula’ by the students. However, the actor will also be playing another role, a tough man with a rural background in the movie. A clip from the shooting spot showing Mohanlal performing an emotional scene surfaced on the internet recently and had gone viral.

The actor was recently seen in the action movie 1971: Beyond Borders and Pulimurugan, that fetched him a special mention at the National Awards.

When I Hit You: Or a Portrait of the Writer as a Young Wife

Written by: Meena Kandasamy

Publication: Juggernaut

Pages: 231 pages

How does one tell a story of a 26-year-old intelligent, educated woman being battered by four months of marriage? To start with, Meena Kandasamy trips the reader by almost drawing a chuckle. The first to play storyteller is the woman’s mother, a figure familiar from lachrymose soaps and painful personal experience. She gets around the socially devastating fact of a divorcee in the family in the tradition of middle-class matriarchs: she makes it about hygiene (when her daughter returns home, “her heels were cracked”, her head was teeming with lice) and herself. “This is how my story of Young Woman as a Runaway Daughter became…the great battle of My Mother versus the Head Lice,” says the narrator of the novel, wryly imagining the fable taking a metaphoric life of its own, being “taught in gender studies programmes”, though it “was a little too dirty and disorienting for white feminists”.

The moment any woman speaks out against the violence and sexual abuse, it does not remain her story. This is lived experience. Why was she out late? What will the relatives say? Did she try hard enough? Is she really as chaste as she looks? Kandasamy’s narrator is keenly aware that her story — a common one in India, where a majority of women face domestic violence — must be wrested back (“I must write my own story”). At one point in the novel, among her many fears — of being beaten to death, disfigured by the daily rape, and trapped in a police case — is that of turning into Althusser’s wife.

The French Marxist philosopher had strangled his wife and rationalised it as “suicide by proxy”, a kind of “non-consensual consent” — and gotten away with it. “As long as a woman cannot speak, as long as those to whom she speaks do not listen, the violence is unending,” Kandasamy writes. This novel, based on the author’s personal life, is an account of unspeakable marital violence, but the subtitle signals her declaration of intent. The writer as a young wife is here to claim the Authorised Version, even if the title, When I Hit You, makes her just another object.

Hit he does, the husband, with everything he can get his hands on — from heavily-buckled belts to MacBook charging cords, from the back of the broomstick to ceramic plates and the drain hose of the washing machine. The house weaponised, against a woman. Communism and the Little Red Book used to show her her place. She is slowly isolated and cut off from the world. First goes the Facebook account. Next, she surrenders her email password, and then he yanks off the cord that connects her to the world: her internet connection. Finally, he deletes all her emails. Marriage becomes a course in Communism 101. There are tutorials which explain how a woman writer cannot claim to be postcolonial because she is a “whore” writing in English, and why, when revolution comes, there will no lipstick for “petty-bourgeois bitches” and how a Communist woman is treated equally by comrades in public but can be slapped behind closed doors”.

This novel does not seek to answer — why didn’t she walk out? — and flip the responsibility of explanation on to the victim. It instead demonstrates how toxic masculine entitlement enables violence, how being hit and beaten eats away at self-confidence and esteem of strong, able women, and how the quicksand of family pressure and societal indifference is always ready to swallow women, given one misstep. The husband in the novel is a one-dimensional figure, but also an accurate one — education and ideology only a top dressing on the soil of sexual insecurity and contempt for women.

But this novel, raw and stifling in parts, stands out because it is seeking — through language, art, through narration — to reclaim dignity and shake off victimhood. To the narrator, it is art and the self-reflexivity it brings that gives her distance from her abuse. When she is being smashed against a wall, she imagines how she might write about it. In defiance of his suspicion about her sexual past, she writes love letters to old lovers, and deletes them before her husband returns. “Every line I have written to you is a thought-crime, which does not leave a trail of evidence.”

Her abuse is primarily physical and sexual, but she feels it equally through the skin of her language — through the expletives he hurls at her during rape. “Every part of my body is a word spat out in disgust.” She bemoans that the smattering of Kannada she has picked up in this small town only permits her to be a housewife, while “English makes me a lover, a beloved, a poet. Tamil makes me a word huntress, it makes me a love goddess.” But it is in language that the novel triumphs, where it fights its battles and wins them. Through memory and knowledge, Kandasamy reclaims language as “a secret place of pleasure”, as a pact between two lovers, and a solace for a solitary woman. “I am the woman sheltered within words,” she writes.

Singapore: Indian-origin man robs petrol pump employee at knife point,"Visvanathan Vaduvelu, 48, fled with 1,193 Singapore dollars (USD 877) in cash from the Shell petrol station situated at 219 Upper Bukit Timah Road. (For representation only) Visvanathan Vaduvelu, 48, fled with 1,193 Singapore dollars (USD 877) in cash from the Shell petrol station situated at 219 Upper Bukit Timah Road. (For representation only)

An Indian-origin man in Singapore has allegedly robbed a petrol station employee at knife point, the first such incident in a decade, police said on Wednesday.

Visvanathan Vaduvelu, 48, fled with 1,193 Singapore dollars (USD 877) in cash from the Shell petrol station situated at 219 Upper Bukit Timah Road on Monday, police said. He threatened an employee with a kitchen knife and ordered her to place money from the cash register in a plastic bag, they said.

Police said that the incident, which took place in broad daylight, was the first such case in 10 years. Vaduvelu, who has been charged with committing armed robbery, faces a maximum of 10 years in jail and at least 12 strokes of caning if found guilty, reported Channel News Asia. Police were alerted at around 12.50 PM after the suspect fled the petrol station on a scooter.

He was tailed by a customer of the petrol station for a short distance, before the customer also informed the police. Even though the suspect was wearing a motorcycle helmet during the robbery, the robbed Shell employee — a 22-year-old woman — remembered the colour of his clothes.

Vaduvelu was arrested on the same day of the robbery at about 4.50 PM along Jurong East Street 21. About 500 dollar in cash, some bank receipts and a scooter were seized by the police. These, along with his outfit -– a black T-shirt, a pair of long black pants, a beige jacket, a motorcycle helmet and a pair of sunglasses -– were also collected as evidence. However, the weapon — a kitchen knife — was not recovered as the suspect dropped it as he was fleeing the crime scene, the police said.

He was remanded without bail, and his next hearing will be held next week. This was the first of two armed robberies in Singapore in as many days.

On Tuesday morning, another armed robbery took place at a Western Union branch in Ubi estate, according to the Channel. The suspect, who took more than 2,000 dollar from Western Union employee at knife point, fled on foot. He was still at large, according to media reports.

Flexi fare: Railways earns additional revenue of Rs 540 crore in less than a year,"There are total 42 Rajdhani trains, 46 Shatabdi and 54 Duronto trains. (File photo) There are total 42 Rajdhani trains, 46 Shatabdi and 54 Duronto trains. (File photo)

The Railways has earned an additional revenue of Rs 540 crore in less than a year through the flexi fare scheme and there is no plan to discontinue it, a senior ministry official said. The scheme, launched on September 9 last year, is applicable in Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto trains, allowing 10 per cent of the seats to be sold at normal fare and thereafter increasing it by 10 per cent with every 10 per cent of berths sold with a ceiling of 50 per cent.

“We have earned money from flexi fare and there is no reason why we should discontinue it. In fact, we have gained 85,000 additional passengers in these trains since we launched the scheme, showing that even passengers are not averse to the scheme,” said a senior official of the ministry. The official told PTI that from September 2016-June 30, 2017, the Railways earned an additional revenue of Rs 540 crore.

The scheme, which officials say will be continuously reviewed, saw a revision last December after the Railways took note of vacant seats in such trains.

The Railways made changes in the flexi fare structure to attract last minute travellers and introduced a range of discounts.

The 30 per cent tatkal charges have been waived for these premium trains, a 10 per cent rebate on basic fare has been offered on vacant berths after preparation of first chart in Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto to lure last minute travellers, provision of tatkal quota has been reduced to 10 per cent from 30 per cent of the total berths available and there is also a provision for discounted fares for some trains. “The scheme now comes with a lot of discounts for passengers and it is a success. However, there is always scope for more reviews,” the official added.

The numbers show a positive trend – during September 2016-June 2017, Duronto trains earned Rs 140 crore more than the amount earned in the same period last year while Shatabdi trains earned Rs 120 crore more. There are total 42 Rajdhani trains, 46 Shatabdi and 54 Duronto trains.

“Just to give an indication of how much the railways is expected to gain from the scheme – we have earned an additional revenue of Rs 240 crore from April-June this year, which is around Rs 80 crore additional revenue per month. This comes to around Rs 960 crore per annum. These are good signs,” the official said.

When Alice visits the real world & Pied Piper protects children,"A scene from the play Shout: Your Voice Matters. A scene from the play Shout: Your Voice Matters.

Fear, guilt, shame, sadness and anger — these are some of the emotions which a child goes through when he or she is subjected to any kind of abuse, psychologists believe. Most children choose to keep silent, either due to the fear that they would be blamed for what happened or that no one would believe them.

Akansha Rangbhoomi, in association with Dnyana Devi Pune Childline, presents ‘Shout: Your Voice Matters’, a play that deals with all kinds of abuses that children are subjected to: verbal, physical, emotional, sexual, bullying and also online bullying. The play, produced by Dnyana Devi Pune Childline, will premiere at Sudarshan Rangmanch on August 4 at 7 pm.

Dnyana Devi Pune Childline, a part of Childline, is a 24-hour, toll free, emergency phone service for children in distress.

Childline is a national programme currently operational in 83 cities in the country and is monitored by National Childline Foundation and supported by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Dnyana Devi is anchoring the service in Pune.

Saggherr Loadhii, director of the play, says, “I have been working on this play for the past one year. The initial months went into research, which involved going through case studies handled by Childline and meeting people who could throw light on the subject. Later, the actors involved in the play wrote monologues, poems and scenes that could capture the topic. We began rehearsing for the play two months ago.”

The play borrows from the plots of three famous fairy tales — Alice in Wonderland, The Pied Piper and The Princess Who Never Smiled — and improvises on them with a touch of the reality of today’s world.

“Given that the play deals with child abuse of various types, in these fairy tales, we have weaved in the incidents of abuse. For instance, a little princess who has been quiet for many days, becomes scared and runs away when a man from her father’s kingdom touches her to ask why she doesn’t smile. While Alice goes to Wonderland in the original story, in our play, Alice visits the real world and realises that the world is not safe for kids. The Pied Piper of our play takes away all the children and tells the parents to make the world a better place if they want their children back,” says Loadhii.

Formed 13 years ago, Akansha Rangbhoomi believes in showcasing works that not only entertain the audience but also touch upon real-life issues.

For instance, one of their productions, Pariviksha, dealt with tribal weddings, another one titled Saraeet, was based on juvenile crimes. The play People who buffer, portrayed the problems faced by stammerers, while Vakhari Dhoos, showcased beedi workers fighting for their rights.

‘FEMA violations’: ED conducts searches at 11 premises of Sandesara Group,"Continuing its crackdown on shell companies, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday conducted searches at 11 premises of a private company that it suspects has been moving money through multiple paper entities. Continuing its crackdown on shell companies, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday conducted searches at 11 premises of a private company that it suspects has been moving money through multiple paper entities.

Continuing its crackdown on shell companies, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday conducted searches at 11 premises of a private company that it suspects has been moving money through multiple paper entities. The agency searched premises associated with Sandesara Group of Companies situated across Ahmadabad, Vadodara, Mumbai and Delhi.

The searches were carried out “on the basis of information that Group companies were indulging in transactions which are complex and suspicious in nature and are being routed through intermediary entities situated in and outside India, in violation of the provisions of FEMA 1999” an ED statement said.

The agency has recovered around 100 rubber stamps of different companies with same address, fixed deposit receipts of Rs 1.8 crore and “incriminating documents”. According to ED, Sandesara owners Chetan Jayantilal Sandesara and Nitin Jayantilal Sandesara are suspected to be controlling more than 151 entities including seven subsidiaries outside India, of which three are in Mauritius, one in Nigeria and three in British Virginia Islands.

“According to available information it is suspected that Shri Chetan Sandesara and Nitin Sandesara are suppressing income, inflating expenses of their companies in India and routing such unaccounted amounts through various bogus / paper entities,” the ED statement said.

The agency raided the premises owned by the gelatin maker Sterling Biotech Ltd in Vadodara, Ahmedabad and an estate in Jambusar in Gujarat, apart from raids conducted in Mumbai and Delhi. According to sources in the ED, a team of nine officers led by ED Joint Director Vishal Sanap raided the company’s premises in Vadodara’s Atladara area on Saturday afternoon.

Sources in the ED added that the agency was also probing funds routed from the Gulf through a film entertainment company located in Mumbai, owned by a famous film star. ED officials said that most of the company’s loans that have been termed as NPAs are lent by state-run banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, Andhra Bank and UCO Bank, among others. The ED is also probing the sale of the company’s 20 per cent stake in a Nigerian oil arm, money of which is said to have been allegedly routed to India through bogus partner firms.

ED officials said that it is suspected that Sterling Biotech Limited in connivance with Dubai-based NRI Arun Pancharia and his entities, perpetrated fraudulent scheme whereby Arun Pancharia subscribed the GDRs to the tune of $15.39 million of Sterling Biotech Limited. “Interestingly the issuer company, Sterling Biotech, itself provided security for bank loan availed for subscription of shares,” ED spokesperson said.

ED said it is also suspected that Sterling Biotech Limited had been exporting coenzyme Qten to UAE/France at highly over invoiced price. “The company is reportedly facing litigation in London for defaulting on repayment of $184 million worth of FCCBs to Overseas Group of Investors. Information has also been received in respect of 13 individuals /entities of Sandesara Group of Companies including Sterling Biotech and Blue Mark Mercantile Pvt. Ltd., for high value suspicious transactions,” ED statement said.

China sacks senior Xinjiang official for not fighting extremism,"China has sacked and will prosecute a senior official in its violence-prone far western region of Xinjiang after a probe found he wasn’t doing enough to tackle extremism in one of the most sensitive parts of the country and had taken bribes. Anti-graft watchdog the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said in a statement late on Saturday that Zhang Jinbiao, who was Communist Party chief for the Hotan region in Xinjiang’s deep south, had broken party rules. Zhang “seriously violated political discipline and political rules and did not exert himself in carrying out his counter-terrorism and stability maintenance responsibilities, causing serious consequences”, it said.

Zhang took gifts, including money, abused his power and had “abnormal sexual relations with others”, the statement said.

Party officials are supposed to be upstanding members of the community, and accusations of sexual impropriety are often used to further blacken an accused person’s name. Hundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in the past few years in violence between Uighurs, a mostly Muslim people who speak a Turkic language, and ethnic majority Han Chinese, especially in the heavily Uighur southern part of Xinjiang.

As a front line official in a part of China that has seen many militant attacks, Zhang had “an important leadership responsibility” but his ideology was weak and he did not follow instructions, the watchdog said, without giving details.

China blames the violence in Xinjiang on Islamist extremists and separatists. Rights groups and Uighur exiles say it is more a product of Uighur frustration at Chinese controls on their culture and religion. China denies any repression. Zhang, 53, had been sacked and expelled from the party and his case would be handed over to legal authorities, the CCDI said, meaning that he would be prosecuted.

It was not possible to reach Zhang for comment and it was unclear if he had been allowed to retain a lawyer. Several senior former Hotan officials have been caught up in President Xi Jinping’s war on deep-seated graft, including Hotan’s former Uighur mayor, Adil Nurmemet, who is now serving a 12-year jail term for corruption.

Zhang, an ethic Han Chinese, has spent his entire working life in Xinjiang, according to his official resume. He only assumed the Hotan job in May last year and was put under investigation in January.

"Manipur’s foremost transgender activist, Santa Khurai, looks back at the movement she helped shape","You’ve come a long way: Santa Khurai, one of the leading activists of the trans community in Manipur. (Photo: Deepak Shijagurumayum) You’ve come a long way: Santa Khurai, one of the leading activists of the trans community in Manipur. (Photo: Deepak Shijagurumayum)

In Imphal, sometime in the late ’90s, Santa Khurai had her long nails broken with a brick in the dead of night, by a bunch of men. They pinned her on the ground in a dark alley off the nearby National Highway, and forced her to shout: “I am a boy but I act like a girl. I have a d*** and can have sex with girls.” They beat her up with a bamboo baton till it broke. But Khurai didn’t.

In her mid-30s now, Khurai is arguably Manipur’s most famous transgender activist. Her work has created a wide visibility for the trans community in the region. She set up the first beauty salon run by a trans person in Manipur. Its success saw numerous salons mushroom throughout the state, all run by members of the transgender community.

It was a transformative idea. It gave them financial agency and a shot at a relatively better life. But it’s something Khurai only grudgingly talks about now. “Because of the easy money, a lot of transpeople, even after all this time, want to work just there. Children are forced into it so they earn money at the cost of their studies,” she says. Khurai shut her own salon, San Jen, in 2010. What had led her to start off the business? “Money,” says Khurai bluntly.

“My parents didn’t give me money because of my gender identity. Whenever I asked for money, my father refused, because I used to just buy girls’ clothes. I had to be self-sufficient,” says Khurai.

Putting together resources to build that little one-room salon wasn’t easy. She pooled her savings and borrowed money from an aunt to train as a beautician in Delhi. “I used all of that to buy a pair of scissors, a water spray and a carpet. I opened the salon in a small room near where I stay in Imphal,” says Khurai. She was also lucky. “Right after I opened my parlour, Hindi cinema was banned in Manipur. People started making videos and other films locally.Work started coming in. Small film companies hired me.”

Her business flourished. Her desire to assert not just her own identity but also that of the community grew as well. 2010 was a significant year in her life — she was invited to be part of a Universal Periodic Review (UPR) working session, a UN human rights initiative, in Delhi. Once she returned to Manipur, she led the All Manipur NupiMaanbi Association (AMANA), a coalition working towards raising awareness of the rights of the transgender community.

Soon after Khurai joined, AMANA came up with the Trans Queen Contest North East. “We were trying to expand the AMANA network to the entire region. But the community wasn’t coming forward. Fashion and beauty were the only things which seemed to bring out the community and so we decided that a trans-queen contest might be the best way ahead.” It was, as both the community and government officials were involved in a larger discussion on legal rights.

However, that success was also earned the hard way. In the mid-90s, the Democratic Youth Federation of India organised the first state-level trans beauty contest in Manipur. It was a ticketed event and made a fair amount of money. After the show was over, the three top participants in the contest received empty envelopes, with “Sorry” written inside.

The “hijacking” of the trans community’s efforts by non-trans groups from “from outside” is a regular phenomenon, says Khurai. “There are lots of non-LGBTQ groups which work in Manipur but why didn’t they do anything before the NALSA verdict came? Why try to mobilise us only after that judgement? This clearly shows that they want to hijack the rights of the trans community and I am totally against it.”

But the larger picture, acknowledges Khurai, isn’t as bad as it used to be. “After the NALSA verdict of 2014, people definitely became more aware. I helped many in my state to get their gender identity changed through required documentation, which helped them get trans-identity passports,” says Khurai. There are still policy and general cultural impediments, but Khurai says, “the community has to come forward. It’s our duty to force the authorities to take forward the discussion. “

Khurai’s strength now is far removed from the fears that haunted her as a child growing up in a conservative family. Born in Imphal, Khurai says she always had “a sense of who I am and I never identified myself as a boy. Always as a girl.” She went to an all-boys school in Imphal, Don Bosco. “Throughout all these years, I was alone — there was constant staring and mocking, even during the assembly sessions at school. Tiffin breaks meant eating by myself in a corner,” says Khurai. Her parents and three elder sisters were not supportive of her either, but — and Khurai says she’s always surprised — her two younger brothers understood.

If friends were hard to come by and family unsupportive, love has been elusive. In college and after, there were a few men who liked her, says Khurai. “But I realised that it wasn’t affection. It was just the sex,” she says.

Khurai talks about a serious relationship she had with a Kashmiri man, an automobile engineer. “He came down to meet me and spent some nights here. Then he totally disappeared — from social media and otherwise,” says Khurai, “I suffered a mental breakdown after that.”

Last year,Khurai underwent a gender affirmation surgery in Australia. She crowdfunded the entire amount online, collecting over $5000. Shockingly, even for Khurai, there were no donations from India. But there are other complaints that Khurai would rather not talk about: “Corruption and casteism is deep-rooted in India and that has a negative impact on the trans community too. There’s a lot of racism in the queer space, for example. I don’t want to talk much about it. I keep going to mainland India as an activist and I might be attacked for personal reasons,” she says.

But Khurai hopes that society will understand some day. In a poem she wrote, dedicated to her father who had passed away in 2015, Khurai says, “He burned at the common crematorium; The place where many women too burned when they died; There he’s gone, leaving no legacy of his own gender.”

All for a good cause: This cafe in Australia charges male customers 18 per cent ‘man tax’,"The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien.(Source: @paigecardona/Twitter) The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien.(Source: @paigecardona/Twitter)

If you are in Melbourne, Australia and happen to look for a vegan cafe, then you can head to Handsome Her. But if you’re a man, be prepared to end up paying more than the female customers. Yes, the cafe levies a surcharge on male customers, but there’s a powerful message behind it.

No one likes paying more taxes based on their gender, right? Then how are people okay with the pay gap based on gender? It’s a known fact that around the world there is a big difference in the remuneration received by men and women. From entertainment industry to big enterprises, many are guilty of practising the vice.

The ‘man tax’ paid at this cafe is to highlight the disparities in pay scale. The male customers are expected to pay a surcharge fixed at 18 per cent but it’s not compulsory or asked every day. The additional cost is levied only once a week, per month.

The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien. She says her restaurant is ‘for women, by women’ but men are always welcome. The main motive behind this move is to start a conversation over the issue of gender equality in the workplace. Talking to the Daily Mirror, O’Brien said, “If men don’t want to pay it, we’re not going to kick them out the door. It’s just an opportunity to do some good.”

She describes herself as a “feminist, not the fun kind”, and added: “We’re bringing it [the gender pay gap] to the forefront of people’s minds. I like that it is making men stop and question their privilege a little bit.”

According to the report by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, which used Australian Bureau of Statistics data from 2016, it stated that the full-time gender pay gap is around 18 per cent. And no, the extra earning is not stashed away, it is donated to charities.

“Alex plans to rotate them four times a year. In August, the earnings will go to an organisation called Elizabeth Morgan House, which helps Aboriginal women and children,” the report added.

Many have praised her for her meaningful initiative.

Give Brazil more time to secure Rio legacy: Thomas Bach,"Thomas Bach said Brazil’s economic crisis was one factor weighing on progress. (Source: Reuters) Thomas Bach said Brazil’s economic crisis was one factor weighing on progress. (Source: Reuters)

Brazil should be given more time to deliver infrastructure promised as its Rio Olympics legacy, the head of the International Olympic Committee said on Friday.

Thomas Bach said Brazil’s economic crisis was one factor weighing on progress and avoided criticising the situation in Rio where many venues sit idle and a new metro line does not extend to the main Olympic Park.

“You have to take into account the extremely difficult situation in Brazil which is the worst crisis this country has ever gone through,” Bach told reporters.

“In such a situation, not all the legacy plans are coming to fruition … in the time they were planned for. ”

Speaking in London, Bach pointed out that the British capital’s Olympic park was closed for a year after the 2012 Games.

“We have to be fair there with the Brazilians,” he said.

“After the games here in London the park was closed … to do the refurbishments and to make the adaptations.”

“You have to give this opportunity to Rio 2016 and, given the very difficult circumstances, give them an extension of this time because, maybe in this emergency situation, they have other priorities,” he said.

A report published by Brazil’s federal agency for Olympic legacy (AGLO) in June said the cost of the Games had risen to 43.3 billion reais ($13.86 billion), around 14.5 billion reais more than originally planned.

After Usain Bolt’s defeat, fellow Jamaican Elaine Thompson will seek to restore the country’s sprint status by adding the World Championship 100 metres crown to her Olympic gold on Sunday.

Thompson, who also won the 200m at the Rio Games last year, is the favourite going into the race as compatriot and three-time world champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce misses out while she prepares for the birth of her first child.

The 25-year-old Thompson will be challenged by Dafne Schippers of the Netherlands and Tori Bowie of the U.S., who claimed the silver and bronze medals in the same event in Beijing two years ago.

The women’s heptathlon also reaches its climax on Sunday in the London Stadium. Germany’s Carolin Schafer leads the standings, with Olympic champion Nafi Thiam of Belgium in second with three events remaining.

The first medals of the day come in the marathon, with the men’s event beginning at 10:55 local time, with Daniel Wanjiru of Kenya looking to secure a London double, having won the city marathon in April. The women’s event begins at 14:00. Both races start and finish at Tower Bridge.

There are also gold medals to be won in the women’s pole vault and the men’s shot put.

German publisher complains to EU court over Turkey detention of journalist,"FILE PHOTO: Protesters carry placards during a demonstration to support arrested German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel outside the Turkish Embassy in Berlin, Germany, February 28, 2017. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch FILE PHOTO: Protesters carry placards during a demonstration to support arrested German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel outside the Turkish Embassy in Berlin, Germany, February 28, 2017. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch

The publisher of Germany’s Die Welt and Welt am Sonntag newspapers has filed a formal complaint at the European Court of Justice about Turkey’s detention of German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel since February, the newspaper reported on Saturday. Turkish authorities arrested Yucel in February on charges of propaganda in support of a terrorist organisation and inciting public violence, amid a large-scale crackdown on alleged supporters of a failed military coup in Turkey a year ago.

Yucel has already filed a separate complaint with the European Court that is being supported by the German government. Berlin has repeatedly called for the release of Yucel and other Germans being held in Turkey and the detentions have contributed to a sharp deterioration in relations between the two NATO allies.

“We are using all legal means to defend the freedom of Deniz Yucel and our publishing house to report,” said Stephanie Caspar, managing director of the publisher, WeltN24 GmbH. “It cannot be accepted without objection that a journalist is thrown into prison simply for doing his job,” she added. A spokesman for the publisher could not immediately be reached by Reuters for further comment.

During Turkey’s post-coup crackdown, some 150 media outlets have been shut and around 160 journalists jailed, the Turkish Journalists’ Association says. In total, authorities have jailed more than 50,000 people pending trial and suspended or dismissed some 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers since the coup, drawing criticism from Turkey’s NATO allies and rights groups.

President Tayyip Erdogan’s government says the crackdown is necessary to tackle security threats facing Turkey. More than 240 people were killed in the coup attempt in July 2016. Turkish opposition leader Kemal Kemal Kilicdaroglu told the German weekly magazine Focus that it was not safe for Germans to travel to Turkey.

“There are no security guarantees for anyone in Turkey,” Kilicdaroglu, head of the secularist Republican People’s Party, (CHP) told the magazine. Kilicdaroglu, who recently completed a 25-day march from the capital Ankara to Istanbul to protest against the crackdown, said he also feared being arrested and hauled before a court, and he sharply criticised Turkey’s arrest of journalists.

“I consider it completely inappropriate to designate German journalists or other citizens who come to Turkey for professional reasons as spies,” he said.

Japan’s PM Shinzo Abe to launch new cabinet after scandals,"Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. (AP Photo) Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. (AP Photo)

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday was set to announce new defence and foreign ministers as part of a cabinet revamp he hopes will stem a decline in public support after a series of scandals and missteps. Political blueblood Abe, in office since late December 2012, has pushed a nationalist agenda alongside a massive policy effort to end years of on-off deflation and rejuvenate the world’s third-largest economy.

But he has seen public support rates plummet in the past few months over an array of political troubles, including allegations of favouritism to a friend in a business deal — which Abe strongly denies. Abe will reportedly reappoint former defence minister Itsunori Onodera to the post after close political ally and fellow hawk Tomomi Inada resigned last week following a scandal at the ministry over the handling of military documents.

He is also set to tap as ministers some who have opposed his policies, including Taro Kono, the son of a dovish former foreign minister known for issuing a 1993 apology as chief cabinet secretary over Japan’s use of “comfort women” — a euphemism for sex slavery — in World War II.

US-educated Kono is set to replace Fumio Kishida, who served as foreign minister since Abe came to power. Kishida, often tapped as a future prime minister, is moving to a top post in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. “I deeply regret that my shortcomings have invited this situation,” a chastened Abe said ahead of the formal announcement of the cabinet changes.

Abe’s LDP suffered a drubbing in local Tokyo elections last month, which analysts and newspapers blamed on an increasing “arrogance” on the part of the prime minister. Kono, 54, is known as an independent-minded, anti-nuclear power advocate, in sharp contrast to Abe’s support for atomic energy.

Meanwhile, Seiko Noda, 56, once hailed as Japan’s most likely first female prime minister and who once tried to challenge Abe for the party leadership, was expected to serve as internal affairs minister. Returning defence chief Onodera, 57, held the post for nearly two years until September 2014, and has vowed to restore unity and confidence within the ministry.

His expected appointment also comes amid rising tensions surrounding North Korea’s missile development. Pyongyang launched its latest missile late Friday, just hours after the US and Japan moved to step up sanctions against it following its earlier test of an ICBM capable of reaching parts of the US.

Meanwhile, Abe was seen leaving some key posts, such as finance minister and chief cabinet secretary, unchanged.

Jose Mourinho has Manchester United squad to work his magic,"Jose Mourinho has the personnel to exert this style of play, and should his new arrivals produce the goods, a serious title tilt could well be on the cards. (Source: Reuters) Jose Mourinho has the personnel to exert this style of play, and should his new arrivals produce the goods, a serious title tilt could well be on the cards. (Source: Reuters)

Although they won two major trophies last season, a sixth-placed Premier League finish cannot be heralded as a success for a club of Manchester United’s size and pedigree.

With the new season fast approaching, however, there is an air of optimism around Old Trafford with a squad now bearing the resemblance of one on which Jose Mourinho can work his magic.

Mourinho identified two key positions to strengthen in the close season. Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s goals needed replacing, long term, and in Romelu Lukaku, Mourinho has a direct, channel-running hitman with a scoring record to rival the very best.

Mourinho is not a possession-based coach. United strolled to Europa League glory against Ajax in May with under 31 percent of the ball.

Lukaku has the engine to make the runs for Paul Pogba to pick with his long, ranging passes on the counter, but can still act as that first line of defence to appease his cautious manager.

“Some people said they (United) did not play good football, but we are not in the circus,” former United full back Patrice Evra told MUTV.

“If you want to enjoy football then, yes 2008 was great and different, but people have to forget that and concentrate on this current Manchester United team.”

This United team now comes complete with Mourinho’s piece de resistance from his summer transfer activity. Whether it was Costinha at Porto – a player Mourinho described as his “assistant coach on the pitch”, or Claude Makelele at Chelsea, that holding midfielder is the one Mourinho has built his teams around.

Nemanja Matic, who anchored Chelsea to Premier League glory under Mourinho in 2014-15, completed his move to United on Monday and Mourinho has his fulcrum once again.

“Nemanja is a Jose Mourinho player,” Mourinho said. “He represents everything we want in a footballer.”

With Victor Lindelof providing addition defensive cover, all the pieces are in place.

The formation Mourinho will deploy remains unclear, but the fact he has so many options is a cause for great excitement among United fans.

After a first season of transition, this is a now Mourinho team.

The football may not always be the most attractive, but his conservative focus has proven successful throughout Europe.

Mourinho has the personnel to exert this style of play, and should his new arrivals produce the goods, a serious title tilt could well be on the cards.

Qatar Airways dropping plan to invest in American Airlines,"(Source: File/ Reuters photo) (Source: File/ Reuters photo)

Qatar Airways says it is dropping an attempt to buy a big stake in American Airlines, an audacious bid that had received a chilly reception from American. Qatar Airways said Wednesday that the investment no longer meets its objectives. American Airlines said it respected Qatar’s decision to withdraw, and added that the turnabout would not make any difference in American’s plans. Qatar said in June that it planned to buy an initial stake of up to 4.75 percent of American’s stock, but Fort Worth, Texas-based American said Qatar’s goal was to get a 10 percent stake.

It was an odd move. The two airlines are on opposite sides of a nasty fight that has big US carriers complaining that they are unfairly undercut on fares because Qatar and two other fast-growing Middle East airlines get illegal subsidies from their governments.

Qatar Airways had said it wanted to be a passive investor and not take an active role in setting strategy at American, the world’s biggest airline.

But on Wednesday, Qatar said it changed its mind after a review of the deal’s finances and American’s reaction.

American CEO Doug Parker had given a chilly public response to the overture, calling it puzzling and not particularly exciting.

Parker said Qatar CEO Akbar Al Baker approached him about an investment during a secret meeting at an airline-industry conference in a Mexican resort city.

Parker vowed that despite the prospect of Qatar becoming a large shareholder, American would continue to fight Qatar, Emirates and Etihad Airways over the allegations of unfair government subsidies. The Middle Eastern airlines deny getting illegal subsidies.

In July, American ratcheted up the tension by announcing that it was dropping seat-selling partnerships with Qatar and Etihad because of the subsidies dispute.

On Wednesday, American spokesman Matt Miller said Qatar’s decision not to invest “in no way changes the course for American.” He said American “couldn’t be more excited to keep our focus” on serving customers.

Qatar said in a statement that it would continue to look for opportunities to invest in airlines around the world to develop “the best possible travel experience for its customers.”

Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. fell 65 cents, or 1.3 percent, to USD 50.41 in midday trading.

Kashmir: 3 Lashkar militants killed in Sopore encounter,"Soldiers block a road in Baramulla during the encounter on Saturday. (Source: Express Photo/Shuaib Masoodi) Soldiers block a road in Baramulla during the encounter on Saturday. (Source: Express Photo/Shuaib Masoodi)

The police and Army killed three local militants associated with the Lashkar-e-Toiba in an encounter in north Kashmir’s Sopore town, the police said. The three had joined militant ranks a few months ago. Eight militants, including Lashkar commander Abu Dujana, were killed in different parts of the Valley in the last four days.

The police and Army launched a cordon-and-search operation at Amargarh after some militants were spotted in the area and claimed to have killed three militants after searches continued through the night. The militants have been identified as Javid Ahmad Dar of Khanpora in Baramulla, Abid Ahmad of Hajin in Bandipora and Danish Ahmad Dar of Batapora in Sopore. Three rifles were recovered, police said.

Sopore SP Harmeet Singh said the forces received information about the presence of three militants and “as the cordon-and-search was launched, the forces had an encounter with militants and all three militants were killed”. Singh said the three belonged to the LeT. “Abid had joined militancy six months ago, Javid had been active for the past three months and Danish was associated with militancy a month ago.’’

Mobile phone and internet services were snapped in the morning in north Kashmir and curbs imposed in Sopore and Baramulla towns. The bodies of the three militants were handed over to their relatives. Clashes broke out at Danish’s funeral in Hajin and three civilians were injured as forces opened fire on them. Abid, 22, was a B Com student at Islamia College. Javid was buried at Khanpora as locals shouted slogans.

I feel left out among the bandwagon of Rio medallists: Deepa Malik,"Deepa Malik has also won two medals at the Para Asian Games. (Source: AP) Deepa Malik has also won two medals at the Para Asian Games. (Source: AP)

India’s Deepa Malik had scripted history when she won the silver medal in the women’s shotput F53 event at the Rio Paralympics in 2016. With that incredible win last year, she became the first Indian woman to win a medal at Paralympic Games. However, on Thursday, when the list of names for the prestigious Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award was announced, one name that was missing was that of Deepa Malik’s. Speaking to the indinaexpress.com Malik expressed surprise at the announcement and revealed that she was heartbroken at the omission while the other three medal winning para-athletes (of Rio 2016) found a place in the elite list.

Stating her disbelief, Deepa Malik, who has bagged 54 gold medals at the national level and 18 at the international level, said, “I am sure there was a competent authority there. So am I not defying the committee which has probably come to a conclusion. But I am surprised that despite being the first woman to bag an athletics medal in the Paralympics last year why did they choose to omit me. I am confused and what just happened was not expected. I am sure they must have seen something.”

Adding that she has full respect for her fellow athletes, the IWAS World Games bronze medallist said, “I have complete regards and honour for what my fellow athletes have achieved. But why my effort was not considered at par is my question. Is my silver not good enough? I am not questioning the decision but it is heartbreaking. It is not something that I can ask for but I do feel left out on the bandwagon of Rio medallists.”

Reminding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on several occasions has quoted her and has spoken highly of her indomitable spirit, Malik said, “I am happy that our PM quotes me at various forums like ‘mann ki baat’ and has deemed as a representative of the spirit of sports. But it does not seem enough yet. I will continue to work hard.

When asked if she will be happy with the award in the near future, Deepa said that it might not possible as the next Paralympics in 2020 does not feature her event. In that case, the wait might be till 2024.

“Unfortunately, if they want me to win another medal in 2020, then that might not be possible as the games do not have my event. That is another unfortunate thing that happens with para-sports. So how are they going to judge even if they select me in the near future? “, Malik wondered.

The trio of Para-athlete Devendra Jhajharia, Javelin thrower Jhajharia and high jumper Mariyappan Thangavelu are the other three who will be honoured at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Augst 29. While Malik will be the only one left out.

“Out of the four of us, three are there so what wrong did I do? Maybe I have to work harder. I definitely thought I would be there. But it is not my hands. What is in my hands is bring home the laurels and I have done that.”, Malik concluded.

Meanwhile, President of the Paralympic Committee of India, Rao Inderjit Singh said that the Paralympic Committee of India had duly recommended the name of Deepa Malik for Khel Ratna Award and were expecting her name to be included in the list. But they sincerely hoped that the government will reconsider her for Khel Ratna Award as per their guidelines.

Need to be aggressive against Indian spinners: Dimuth Karunaratne,"Dimuth Karunaratne scored 25 in first innings of second Test against India. (Source: AP) Dimuth Karunaratne scored 25 in first innings of second Test against India. (Source: AP)

Sri Lanka were in a spot of bother when they lost a couple of wickets in reply to India’s first innings total of 622/9 (D) in the second Test of the three-match series. Talking about the spin and bounce, Dimuth Karunaratne admitted that there would be more turn on third day as compared to first one.

“You will see more turn and bounce than we were seeing on the first day. Because of the ball’s hardness you will get turn and bounce. Maybe after the hardness is gone it will be easy to bat later on,” said Karunaratne.

“There was help in the wicket – you have to admit that. In Galle though there wasn’t much in the wicket, it was the way Shikhar Dhawan batted took the game away from us. We had to go to defensive fields. We can’t attack when two fours are being hit in an over. They (Indians) are very smart, when we adopt defensive approach they work the singles,” he added.

Talking about the hardness of the ball, the opener added that it would be a difficult task to bat in the first 10-15 overs on day 3.

“We all want to save the Test match. In the first 10-15 overs with the ball’s hardness it is not easy to bat. After the hardness is gone I think the help is not there for the spinners,” he said.

Though the hosts lost two wickets, Dinesh Chandimal and Kusal Mendis made it sure that there were no more fall of wickets in the day and remained not out at stumps.

“Dinesh Chandimal and Kusal Mendis batted really well in the last few overs. We have to play positively. We have to play more sweep and reverse sweep shots. Last time when we played in Galle, Chandi (Chandimal) scored 160-odd runs. A lot of his runs came off the sweep and reverse sweep. I think that will be key,” he added.

Mentioning about Ashwin’s ability to bowl variations, he said that he was able to turn the ball quite efficiently.

“You have to play one ball at a time. It’s not easy. He’s (Ashwin) a good spinner. He has variations. When I was batting I was playing for the straighter one. It’s turning a lot. You can play for both the turn and straighter one,” he said.

“I’m trying to play more balls from him, because if I batted a long time he will try to do something else and we can capitalise on the loose balls. That was my target when I was batting against Ashwin,” Karunaratne said.

Anthony Scaramucci memo shows ambitious plans for press office,"Anthony Scaramucci (Reuters File Photo) Anthony Scaramucci (Reuters File Photo)

Ousted White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci had high hopes for improved relationships with reporters, according to a memo posted online Wednesday. The memo lists five priorities for the communications staff, including “Improve the culture” and “Fill the content void.”

Scaramucci writes that President Donald Trump “can choose to fight with the media, but Comms can not,” and he even suggests “a constructive `complaint box’ for the media to make complaints.”

Still, the memo points out, “Comms is a Customer Service Operation?_?POTUS is the Number One Customer.” It says the office needs to “humanize” Trump and suggests “a national online lottery to play a round of golf with him . or a charity auction.”

Scaramucci also calls for “video content that constructively operates as `The President Donald J. Trump’ show.”

Scaramucci envisions running the communications department “like a news channel with producers, scripts, and narration” that will be able to “dictate the news of the day on most days.”

After his appointment was announced, Scaramucci was very vocal about leaks coming out of the White House — even telling a New Yorker reporter he wanted to “kill all the leakers.”

His memo is a little more restrained. He writes: “No more threats about leaking and internal game playing anyone who takes actions that do not serve the President will be dismissed. period. We will eliminate the bad eggs and send a powerful message to the remaining staff that well-intentioned mistakes are acceptable, but misconduct is not.”

The memo is dated July 30, just a day before Scaramucci was ousted by new chief of staff John Kelly. Scaramucci was named to the position on July 21.

Sacaramucci has confirmed he wrote the memo. It was posted on Medium.com by right-wing media personality and Trump supporter Mike Cernovich.

The Secret Service command post inside President Donald Trump’s namesake Manhattan skyscraper has been moved. A spokeswoman for the umbrella company that controls Trump’s various businesses said today that the Secret Service moved out of Trump Tower to somewhere “more cost effective and logistically practical.”

The Secret Service won’t say where its Trump Tower command post has relocated. A spokeswoman says the move hasn’t affected security. A Government Services Administration spokeswoman says officials are searching for a permanent space. She wouldn’t comment on lease negotiations.

The Trump Organization’s Amanda Miller described the location change as a mutual decision. She didn’t respond when asked about terms of the government’s lease or what prompted the location change.

Trump hasn’t visited his Trump Tower residence since moving into the White House.

Usain Bolt Retires: Legend’s Swansong,"Usain Bolt will run his final 100m race. Usain Bolt will run his final 100m race.

Usain Bolt’s season best of 9.95 seconds is his slowest going into a major championships since he won gold at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Turning 31 this month and plagued by a recurring back injury, Bolt is expected to turn on the turbocharger in the final of the men’s 100 metres on Saturday night. His past performances prove that when on the big stage, he always steps it up. Here’s looking at how he saves the best for D-day.

Can Gatlin spoil his party? Olympic bronze medallist Andre De Grasse was to be the strongest challenger to Bolt but the Canadian has pulled out with a hamstring injury. So can anyone beat Bolt?

Yohan Blake: SB: 9.90. Once considered as Bolt’s heir apparent, the Jamaican faded away following a string of injuries. At present, he is nursing a groin injury.

Christian Coleman: SB: 9.82 – The 21-year-old American is the fastest man this season. However, his big-race temperament is still in question.

Justin Gatlin: SB: 9.95 – The American has the exact same season best as Bolt but at 35, he isn’t as fast as he was a couple of years back.

Where is Bolt the fastest and slowest in the 100m sprint?

Slowest at the start, fastest between 60m to 80, and stepping off the pedal at the finish is how Usain Bolt went about breaking the World record in Berlin eight years ago. A break-up of the speed during Bolt’s 9.58-second 100 metre race at the Berlin World Championships of 2009.

Longest stride: 2.38m The average stride length in metres of Bolt during the men’s 100 metre final at the Rio Olympic Games.

Least number of steps: 42 The bigger stride length translates into less number of steps when it comes to Bolt completing a 100 metre race.

Second slowest reaction time: .155 is Bolt’s reaction time on the starting block in the Rio Olympics final, the second slowest in the field.

France has seen 271 jihadi militants return: Minister,"The number of jihadis to have returned to France included 217 adults and 54 minors, with some of them currently in detention, Gerard Collomb said in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche. The number of jihadis to have returned to France included 217 adults and 54 minors, with some of them currently in detention, Gerard Collomb said in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche.

France has seen 271 jihadi militants return from war zones in Iraq and Syria and all of them are subject to investigation by public prosecutors, the country’s interior minister said in a newspaper interview. Some 700 French nationals are estimated to have fought in Islamic State ranks in Iraq and Syria, and like other European countries France has been wrestling with how to handle the flow of so-called returnees.

The number of jihadis to have returned to France included 217 adults and 54 minors, with some of them currently in detention, Gerard Collomb said in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche. Asked how many French jihadis had been killed in Iraq and Syria, Collomb told the Sunday newspaper that it was difficult to corroborate information.

The head of France’s special forces said in June that his units were directly involved in street battles in the Iraqi city of Mosul but denied they were specifically targeting French-born jihadis fighting for Islamic State. France has participated in a U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State in Iraq, and it also intervened in Mali to push back an Islamist rebellion in the west African state.

French military interventions overseas have exposed it to attack by Islamist militants at home. Gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in and around Paris in November 2015 and over 100 were killed in other Islamist attacks in France in the past two-and-a-half years. Collomb said the threat of militant attacks was “very high”, citing two incidents targeting police on Paris’ Champs Elysees and seven foiled plots so far this year.

An increasing number of people were being flagged under a preventative monitoring system for radicalised behaviour, with more than 18,500 people reported, he said. France has been subject to state of emergency legislation, giving police extended powers, since the November 2015 attacks, and the government plans to incorporate some of these measures into ordinary law through a counter-terrorism bill to be put before parliament in the coming months.

China again blocks move to list Masood Azhar as terrorist,"JeM founder Masood Azhar. (File Photo) JeM founder Masood Azhar. (File Photo)

China has again extended by three months its technical hold on the US, France and UK-backed proposal to list JeM chief and Pathankot terror attack mastermind Masood Azhar as a designated terrorist by the UN. China had in February this year blocked the US move to designate Azhar as a global terrorist at UN. The deadline for China to take action on its technical hold was till August 2.

If China would not have extended the technical hold, Azhar would have automatically been designated under the UN as a terrorist. Sources told PTI here that just before the deadline lapsed, China once again sought a three-month extension until November 2 on its technical hold on the proposal.

A veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council, Beijing has repeatedly blocked India’s move to put a ban on the Jaish-e-Mohammed leader under the AlQaeda Sanctions Committee of the Council.

Last year in March, China was the sole member in the 15-nation UN organ to put a hold on India’s application with all other 14 members of the Council supporting New Delhi’s bid to place Azhar on the 1267 sanctions list that would subject him to an assets freeze and travel ban. The six-month validity of that technical hold lapsed in September and Beijing then extended it by three more months.

In December last year, after China blocked India’s proposal to list the JeM chief, Indian diplomatic sources here had said that the pursuit of terrorism was not a “one-shot affair” for India and that it will continue to pursue issues of terrorism “through all available mechanisms”.

Sources had said that the block would not prevent India from pursuing at the world body issues of terrorism and sanctioning of leaders of terror outfits.

AC Milan brush aside Univesitatea Craiova in Europa League qualifier,"AC Milan completed a 3-0 aggregate victory. (Source: AP) AC Milan completed a 3-0 aggregate victory. (Source: AP)

AC Milan brushed aside Univesitatea Craiova in front of a euphoric crowd who packed the San Siro for a Europa League qualifier on Thursday. Giacomo Bonaventura and Patrick Cutrone scored early in each half to give Milan a 2-0 win as they completed a 3-0 aggregate victory in their third qualifying round tie.

Milan’s spending spree since the end of last season has revived interest in the side and generated a feeling of unbridled optimism among their supporters.

Their first home European tie for more than three years pulled in a 65,000 crowd to watch them face opponents who finished fifth in Romania last season, the supporters clearly believing that the years of midtable mediocrity are over.

“It’s been a great night and the fans deserved it for the love which they have shown the club,” said coach Vincenzo Montella. “We hope to have many more evenings like this and will work hard to make it happen.”

The seven-times European champions threw themselves onto the attack and went ahead after nine minutes when Bonaventura fired in a loose ball from 12 metres.

The hosts survived a scare when goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma denied Ionit Mitrita, who had a clear run on goal.

Cutrone made the game safe in the 52nd minute when he turned the ball in after Mateo Musacchio flicked on Ricardo Rodriguez’s free kick.

"Donald Trump lashes out over Russia probe, after news of grand jury","“We didn’t win because of Russia. We won because of you,” Trump said yesterday at a campaign-style rally in West Virginia. “We didn’t win because of Russia. We won because of you,” Trump said yesterday at a campaign-style rally in West Virginia.

Donald Trump has described Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as a “total fabrication” amid reports that a special prosecutor has impaneled a grand jury to investigate the issue — a step toward possible criminal indictments. “We didn’t win because of Russia. We won because of you,” Trump said yesterday at a campaign-style rally in West Virginia. Trying to build support among his core supporters, he said his enemies were “trying to cheat you out of the leadership you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us and most importantly, demeaning to our country and demeaning to our constitution.”

“The reason why Democrats only talk about the totally made-up Russia story is because they have no message, no agenda, and no vision,” he said. “The Russia story is total fabrication. It’s just an excuse for the greatest loss in the history of American politics.” His comments came after the Wall Street Journal revealed that special counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury to investigate Russia’s interference with the 2016 presidential election.

The newspaper, citing two unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reported that the grand jury had begun its work in the US capital Washington “in recent weeks.” The move is a sign that the sweeping federal investigation — which includes allegations that Trump campaign officials coordinated with Russia to tilt the election in the Republican’s favor — is gathering pace. The establishment of a grand jury will allow Mueller — a former FBI director — to subpoena documents and get sworn testimony. It could well lead to criminal indictments.

“It’s a significant escalation of the process,” national security attorney Bradley Moss told AFP. “You don’t impanel a grand jury unless your investigation has discovered enough evidence that you feel reflects a violation of at least one, if not more, criminal provisions,” he said. “If you secure an indictment, your next step is to arrest the defendant.”

Presidential lawyer Ty Cobb said he was not aware that a grand jury had been convened. “Grand jury matters are typically secret,” Cobb said, adding that “the White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly.” “The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr Mueller.”

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president was not likely the subject of the investigation. “Former FBI director Jim Comey said three times the president is not under investigation and we have no reason to believe that has changed,” she said. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores declined to comment on the report. Trump has repeatedly denied allegations of collusion, saying he is the victim of a political “witch hunt” and “fake news.”

But he has been forced to acknowledge that his eldest son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign advisor Paul Manafort did meet a Kremlin-connected lawyer to get dirt on Hillary Clinton. Mueller is also said to be investigating Trump’s financial records unrelated to Russia or the election, CNN reported. Trump has publicly warned Mueller that his financial dealings should be out of bounds and investigating them would cross a red line.

If called to testify before a grand jury, Trump would not be the first president to do so. Then president Bill Clinton was forced to give details about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, evidence that was used in his impeachment.

"Athletics needs to sell itself better, says long jump champion Greg Rutherford","Greg Rutherford is unable to defend his title at the World Championships. (Source: Reuters) Greg Rutherford is unable to defend his title at the World Championships. (Source: Reuters)

Athletics needs to shake itself out of the Dark Ages and be much better at presenting what is a great product, according to world and Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford.

The injured Briton is unable to defend his title at the World Championships, which begin in London on Friday, but will have a different view on proceedings in his new role as an expert analyst for Eurosport. Rutherford’s career high when he was one of the golden trio to triumph on Britain’s “Super Saturday” at the 2012 Olympics was fully appreciated by the sellout crowd and worldwide TV audience but he, like many field event participants, has also seen the other side of the coin when his event has been virtually lost in the often-chaotic spectacle of a full athletics programme.

“Sometimes when you are down there competing it’s hard even for us to know what’s going on, knowing what our rivals are doing,” Rutherford told Reuters in a telephone interview on Thursday.

“There’s often so much going on that some events can get a little lost. I actually think in some ways the sport is in the Dark Ages in terms of presenting itself; we could be much better because there is so much great stuff to see.”

Rutherford said he had really enjoyed competing in the City Games held in Manchester city centre in May and said other similar innovations could help meet the challenge of “remaining relevant” that IAAF head Sebastian Coe said this week was the sport’s number one challenge.

“We’ve been blessed to have had Usain Bolt but I think we could have done more to use his appeal to spread the news about the other great performers,” he said.

Rutherford, who also has Commonwealth and European titles to his name and an Olympic bronze from Rio last year, said he was immensely frustrated to have missed out on defending his title but had to take the long-term view after failing to overcome an ankle injury sustained in June and further complications from a sportsman’s hernia “In this sport you have to be 100 percent fit, especially in my event,” he said.

You can’t be 99 and a half percent, not with the quality of opposition around, that’s not going to be good enough.

“I’m devastated that I won’t be able to compete in that stadium which is such a special place for me, the place that changed my life. But there was no choice in the end so I’ll just have to focus on recovery and look to next year and trying to become the first to win three European titles in a row.”

In his absence Rutherford said there could well be a South African 1-2 in London with Luvo Manyonga, the world leader and stand-out performer this season, and Ruswahl Samaai the men to beat.

However, with four Americans in the field, including Olympic champion Jeffrey Henderson, he said their competitive juices mean it would not be a surprise if one of them pulled out a big one on the day.

“I’m really looking forward to watching the event through different eyes and hopefully bringing some insight to Eurosport viewers,” said the 30-year-old.

“It’s a role I’m really excited about. I’ve always enjoyed that media interaction and it’s something I want to learn about and maybe one day I would love to make that transition. But I’d like to think I’ve got a few more big competitions in me yet.”

VIP 2 actor Dhanush: I am very happy right now with my work. I am a very secure actor,"Dhanush doesn’t believe in competition and feels secure as an actor Dhanush doesn’t believe in competition and feels secure as an actor

South star Dhanush says he is a very secure actor and does not worry about reaching a stage in his career where he won’t be getting work. “I am very happy right now with my work. I am a very secure actor. I don’t think about whether I will get work tomorrow or not,” Dhanush told PTI.

“What is meant for me is mine and God will not give me anything less or more. I am not going to take anything with me when I am buried six feet under,” he says. The 34-year-old actor says he doesn’t believe in competition with his peers and rather focusses on doing his best with every film. “I don’t think competition is necessary for the film industry. There is no point in it. There has to be a reason for competition. Here in our profession, we all our winners if our film works well.

“I certainly compete with myself so that I can be better in my next film. I want to offer my best to the audience every time they come to watch my film,” he says. Dhanush is currently busy promoting his next film Velai Illa Pattadhari 2, also known also as VIP 2. It also stars Kajol and is directed by Soundarya Rajinikanth. The Tamil comedy-drama is a sequel to the 2014 film Velaiilla Pattadhari.

“I have done promotional activities here (in Mumbai) before during Ranjhaana and Shamitabh. I know how it (promotions) works but I am not used to it. So it is tough.” He says the box office numbers are important to him. His last Hindi film release was Shamitabh, with megastar Amitabh Bachchan. The film bombed at the box office and Dhanush says the failure of the movie did hurt him. “I would be lying if I said that the box office numbers did not hurt me. I am very proud of that film and if given a choice, I would like to do it again. If you can make all the decisions right as an actor then every film will be successful at the box office. Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we don’t. Shamitabh is a great film and I am very proud of it,” he says.

Petra Kvitova cruises as favourites dominate at Stanford,"Petra Kvitova is playing her fourth event since spending six months recovering from stab wounds. (Source: USA TODAY File) Petra Kvitova is playing her fourth event since spending six months recovering from stab wounds. (Source: USA TODAY File)

Second seed Petra Kvitova was barely troubled in her first match at the Stanford Classic as the big-hitting Czech needed just an hour to demolish Kateryna Bondarenko 6-2 6-2 in a second round encounter on Thursday.

The two-time Wimbledon champion looked back to her best as she builds strength following a career-threatening knife attack at the end of last year and did not face a single break point against her 111th-ranked Ukrainian opponent.

“I served very well, and I was just trying to play my game, which I always try, and sometimes that works, sometimes not,” Kvitova, who hit 31 winners, said after her victory in California.

Kvitova is playing her fourth event since spending six months recovering from stab wounds to her left hand inflicted by an intruder at her home in the Czech Republic.

The Czech suffered second round losses at the French Open and Wimbledon but now has the U.S. Open, starting later this month, firmly in her sights.

Next up for Kvitova is a quarter-final against eighth seeded American Catherine Bellis, who advanced with 7-6(3) 6-2 victory over Veronica Cepede Royg of Paraguay.

All four second-round matches on Thursday were won in straight sets as the form book prevailed.

Russian fourth seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova beat American Alison Riske 6-4 6-0, while sixth seed CoCo Vandeweghe thrashed fellow American Nicole Gibbs 6-0 6-2.

Vandeweghe seems to be thriving under the guidance of coach Pat Cash.

“I think we’re out of the honeymoon,” she joked, before explaining that Cash in a hard task-master.

All eight seeds are through to Friday’s quarter-finals with top seeded Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza opening proceedings against Ana Konjuh of Croatia.

"Child abuse, neglect linked to gender inequality: Study","Rates of discrimination against women substantially influence the levels of child physical abuse and child neglect. (Source: File Photo) Rates of discrimination against women substantially influence the levels of child physical abuse and child neglect. (Source: File Photo)

Children growing up in societies that experience high level of gender inequality are more likely to be maltreated, finds a study that identified a link between child abuse, neglect and gender inequality.

The research found that the rate of physical abuse of children varied between 1 and 43 per cent, while child neglect rates stood between 0.8 and 49 per cent. Rates of discrimination against women substantially influence the levels of child physical abuse and child neglect, said Joanne Klevens from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in the US.

For the study, published in the journal Family Violence, the team analysed data from 57 countries on incidences of severe physical discipline of children in the form of hitting, slapping or repeated beatings or child neglect. Approximately 44 per cent of the countries had a high or very high level of human development, but one-third were considered to have low human development.

The data was based on surveys conducted by the UN International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) and Demographic and Health Surveys conducted by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from 2011 to 2015. Using the Social and Institutional Gender Index (SIGI) and the Gender Gap Index (GGI), the researchers assessed the impact of gender inequality and the rate of child abuse or neglect in each country.

Based on the findings, efforts to prevent child abuse and neglect might benefit from reducing gender inequity, the researchers noted.

WhatsApp Android beta reveals Facebook-like coloured text Status,"WhatsApp will reportedly add a new floating pencil button right above the camera icon in the Status tab. Users can click on the icon to upload coloured text status. WhatsApp will reportedly add a new floating pencil button right above the camera icon in the Status tab. Users can click on the icon to upload coloured text status.

WhatsApp is testing the same colourful text statuses for its Status tab that Facebook rolled out last year. According to a report in Android Police, the feature is a part of WhatsApp beta version 2.17.291. Users who’ve enrolled into WhatsApp’s official Play Store beta program should get access to new colourful statuses earlier than everyone else. The report notes that this is probably a server-side test, which means the feature might not necessarily be available for all even if they’re on the latest version of the app.

WhatsApp will reportedly add a new floating pencil button right above the camera icon in the Status tab. Users can click on the icon to upload coloured text status. WhatsApp will give users three options – to add emojis, select font, and change background colour – to design coloured text status. Once done, users will need to click on the green arrow icon at the bottom right to post Status.

Facebook started rolling out coloured text status feature for Android in December. It lets users add background colours to text-only posts, and doesn’t work for links, image ,or video posts. Currently, Facebook offers more than ten background colour options to choose from. This includes white, yellow, yellow and orange gradient, red-orange, green and blue gradient and, more. We’ll have to wait and watch what WhatsApp has in store for users.

WhatsApp has announced it has a total of 1.3 billion monthly active users on the app. According to the Facebook-owned company, it has over 250 million daily users on the Status feature. WhatsApp Status, which is a clone of Snapchat’s Stories, was unveiled in February.

WhatsApp, which has more than 200 million users in India, is said to be working on an integrated UPI-based wallet. If reports are anything to be believed, the social messaging platform has initiated discussions with National payments Corporation of India (NCPI) as well.

"Before moving to PSG, Neymar helped convince Dani Alves to join","Dani Alves was signed by Paris Saint-Germain to bring some extra experience to their defense. (Source: AP File) Dani Alves was signed by Paris Saint-Germain to bring some extra experience to their defense. (Source: AP File)

Even before joining Paris Saint-Germain, Neymar was assisting the team. PSG defender Dani Alves disclosed Saturday that he was advised by Neymar to move to the French capital last month _ rather than sign for Manchester City _ after being released by Juventus.

Neymar also let former Barcelona teammate Alves in on the secret that he was thinking about making the record-breaking 222 million euro ($262 million) transfer from the Camp Nou.

“I talked to him about the possibility,” Alves said. “He recommended me to come here. He suggested that I come to the club. I said I wanted to leave Juventus, and he was thinking of coming here.”

While Alves made his PSG league debut on Saturday in a 2-0 victory over Amiens, Neymar is yet to play for the French capital club after his international clearance didn’t come through in time.

“There is anticipation because of the football he plays and his will to show it to the world,” said the 35-year-old Alves, who won the Spanish league, Champions League and Club World Cup alongside Neymar at Barcelona. “You take a giant step when you have a player of this level to play against the other teams. This team will get a quality leap forward.”

Neymar’s transfer more than doubled the previous world transfer record set a year ago when Manchester United paid 105 million euros (then $116 million) to sign Paul Pogba.

“We are not moved by money,” Alves said. “Few people leave their comfort zone, and we are Brazilians. Brazilians do that.”

The arrival of Neymar and Alves adds an even stronger Brazilian flavor to a squad captained by Thiago Silva, whose center back partner is compatriot Marquinhos.

“Our group is very good, people here are very close,” Alves said. “This makes adapting a little easier. (Neymar) is very happy and we welcomed him with open arms. I am close because I know what this is like. He came to the right place at the right time.”

Neymar’s move to PSG raised eyebrows because he is leaving one of soccer’s most illustrious teams for a club that has never won the Champions League.

“It isn’t only about Barcelona, about Spanish clubs,” Alves said. “There is life, challenge and football in other places. Neymar coming changes PSG’s position for sure. It inevitable that there are expectations. His greatness brings all that.”

Suspense on next move by SIT in Hyderabad drug case,"Some sections of Tollywood have alleged that the industry is being unfairly targeted. Some sections of Tollywood have alleged that the industry is being unfairly targeted.

Speculation abounds on the next move by Telangana’s Prohibition and Excise Department in its high-profile investigation into the sensational drug racket allegedly involving several film personalities.

After the questioning of 12 personalities from the Telugu film industry, owners of several pubs and bars, issuing notices to schools and colleges and even some information technology companies, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) has taken a pause, triggering the speculation over its next move.

There was no clarity, for instance, as to whether the SIT will call in more Tollywood personalities for questioning.

SIT officials have of late been tight-lipped, worried over the ripples the investigation is causing in film circles and its possible impact on brand Hyderabad, even as the Telangana government announced that drug users, including celebrities, will be treated as victims and not criminals.

The announcement by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on July 28 came a few days after Akun Sabharwal, the Enforcement Director of the department who is heading the probe, told media that the possession, sale, purchase and consumption of any psychotropic substance is a crime under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.

The SIT has so far questioned top actors like Ravi Teja, Charmme Kaur and leading director Puri Jagannadh. Actress Mumaith Khan, actors Tarun, Navdeep, Nandu and Subbaraju were among others quizzed in the case over the last two weeks.

Their names cropped up during the investigation into a high-end drug network when the SIT allegedly found their contact numbers with the accused.

The SIT has so far arrested over 20 persons, including US citizen Dundu Anish, a former aerospace engineer who has worked with NASA, Dutch national Mike Kamminga and seven B.Tech degree holders, most of them employed with multinational companies.

“Based on the statements given by the accused and others who were called for questioning, the SIT will decide whether to call more people for questioning,” said an official.

Some sections of Tollywood have alleged that the industry is being unfairly targeted, but the authorities deny this is the case. Excise Commissioner R.V. Chandravadan said more than 30 people were questioned and they include people from different walks of life.

The investigations over the last one month has seen some dramatic turns and twists. The busting of the racket in early July initially sent shock waves across educational institutions, with the probe revealing that students of several top private schools and colleges were using drugs.

The officials found that students as young as 13, including girls, were taking what they call high-end drugs like Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) and Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), popularly known as Ecstasy.

Experts have described these as highly destructive drugs which affect the brain’s functioning. The fact that the peddlers managed to penetrate campuses sent alarm bells ringing and indicate how wide and well-organised the racket is.

The officials, after questioning Calvin Mascrenhas, said to be the kingpin of the racket, and other accused, identified 1,000 students hailing from rich and influential families and studying at top schools and colleges as the customers.

The investigations also revealed how peddlers were placing orders through Darknet (a restricted online network) and how the drugs were being delivered by couriers, including from overseas.

Without revealing the identity of the students, SIT sent letters to over 50 schools and colleges to keep a tight vigil.

When investigators found some Tollywood celebrities among customers, the focus shifted to the film industry.

The notices served on the stars led to criticism from some sections of the industry. Leading filmmaker Ram Gopal Verma slammed the excise department for targeting Tollywood to get publicity.

Adding a new twist, authorities also identified some drug users as techies working in software firms in Hyderabad. Excise Minister T. Padma Rao revealed that notices were issued to 13 IT companies, whose employees were found to be using drugs.

Information Technology Secretary Jayesh Ranjan was apparently not pleased with the portrayal of the entire IT industry as bad by a section of media. “Only 10 to 12 people in a workforce of 400,000 are indulging in this activity (drug use),” he clarified.

"A lake, forests, mountains…Pokhara has many delights","The best time to leave Kathmandu for Pokhara is early morning when there is less traffic in the capital city. The other option is to take a flight. (Source: File Photo) The best time to leave Kathmandu for Pokhara is early morning when there is less traffic in the capital city. The other option is to take a flight. (Source: File Photo)

Standing by a lake, with forested hills on one side and snow-capped Himalayan peaks on the other, was an unforgettable moment for me in Pokhara, the picturesque Nepalese city that is arguably its tourism capital.

Pokhara was a discovery in several ways. It has a laidback charm that contrasts with the rush and pollution of capital Kathmandu. The translucent Phewa lake provided some breath-taking vistas and the experience of observing the peaks of the Annapurna range at close quarters was memorable.

Sarangkot, a hill station near Pokhara, offers spectacular views of the Annapurna range and I was told to reach there early to witness the snow-capped mountains change hues in the rays of the rising sun.

I left my hotel at 4 am and reached the designated point well before the sunrise. As I waited, there was no sign of the sun. There were clouds and mist and much as I wished they disappeared, they would not. I, however, did not leave the place disappointed.

The scene of the valley below was clearer and almost like an image from the sky. The houses looked tiny and there were vast swathes of greenery. As the valley undulated, with Phewa lake almost in the middle, smaller hills gave way to bigger ones and to still bigger ones.

On the agenda during the day was a boat ride on the lake’s tranquil waters. The 15-minute ride to Tal Barahi temple on an island in the expansive lake presented panoramic views as the backdrop shifted from forested hills to the mountains. A gentle breeze blew across, adding to the pleasant feeling.

Pokhara has a few tourist and religious spots near the lake. I visited Devi’s Falls, which gets its name from a Swiss citizen Davis who was swept away by its gushing waters in 1961 while taking bath with her husband. Her body was later recovered after a lot effort.

Not far away is Gupteshwar Mahadev cave — its upper part a temple to Lord Shiva. The lower part, which is reached by some deft walking, leads to cascading waters that spring out from rocks after going underground at the Devi’s Falls.

Pokhara offers good shopping options and almost all that you get in Kathmandu’s tourism district of Thamel is available here, sometimes at a better price. The place is also popular with adventure-lovers who have a wide range of options, including paragliding, rafting, sky-diving and mountain trekking.

There are eating options galore, with restaurants serving a variety of international cuisines — Korean, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, French and Thai.

One of my fondest memories in Pokhara is of working while seated outside a restaurant on a table and chair crafted from a log of wood. Working on my computer in this setting, with people of different nationalities and in different moods passing by, was quite different from the usual work in a formal setting.

While Pokhara was a treat, reaching the city from Kathmandu was not. The nearly 200-km road journey took two hours more than the seven it usually takes. There was road repair work on in Kathmandu which led to unusually long snarls.

The best time to leave Kathmandu for Pokhara is early morning when there is less traffic in the capital city. The other option is to take a flight.

Among the charms of a road journey is that a large part is along the Trishuli river. There are agricultural fields carved into hill slopes, delicate bridges that connect villages to the main road and colourful houses.

There are several eating options on the way and we opted for a landscaped restaurant that served an authentic Nepali thali — largely comprising green vegetables — and the piping hot food helped beat the tiredness.

As I was packing my bag after a satisfying visit, my roommate asked if I had gone to the terrace see a clear view of the peaks ofthe Annapurna range. As I stepped out on the terrace, the view of Machapuchare (also known as fish tail mountain) was mesmerising.

The 6,993-metre mountain, revered by the locals, was shinning in golden hues in the morning sun alongside other peaks of Annapurna range. It was a sight to behold.

But then, all good things must come to an end and it was time to return to the mundane world.

Taliban insurgents launched coordinated attacks form three different directions on Sayad district in northern Sari Pul province killing at least seven security forces, said a provincial official. Zabi Amani, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said Saturday that insurgents seized control of the strategic Mirzawalang area in Sayad district earlier in the day after two days of intense gun battle with the Afghan Security forces.

“We requested reinforcement for the central government, unfortunately couldn’t get any support, that is why the forces lost control of Mirzawalang,” said Amani.

Qari Yusouf Ahamdi, a Taliban spokesman, claimed responsibility for the attack in an email addressed to media. Amani said that 10 Taliban fighters, including two group leaders, were also killed in the battles and four Afghan security officers were wounded.

The Taliban have stepped up their attacks on the country’s northern provinces recently. The group seized control several months ago of another district in the same province, form where they organized and initiated their attack, according to local officials.

There have been unconfirmed reports of more than a dozen civilians, as well as local police, being killed after the insurgents took control of the area, added Amani.

Elsewhere, the provincial director of the counter-narcotics unit in western Ghor province was killed by two gunmen, said the spokesman for the provincial police chief in Ghor province, Iqbal Nezami, Saturday.

Two men on a motorbike shot and killed counter-narcotics chief Noorudin Shairfi in the province’s capital Faroz Koh, said Nezami. “No one has been arrested, but the police have launched an investigation,” he added.

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack in Ghor.

Meanwhile, in southern Kandahar province a member of the Afghan police force was shot and killed by NATO advisers before he was able to attack their forces, according to a NATO-led Resolute Support mission statement.

The statement released Saturday said the incident took place near Kandahar Airfield after the advisers had completed scheduled law enforcement training and were attacked by a police officer as they were preparing to return to their base.

The Romanian soldiers, who were providing security for the Train, Advise and Assist Command south advisers, returned fire in self-defense and killed the gunman, it said.

A wounded Romanian soldier is being treated at Kandahar Airfield’s medical facilities and another Afghan policeman who was wounded in gunfire exchange is being treated at an Afghan medical facility, it added.

"Donald Trump, frustrated by Afghan war, suggests firing US commander: Officials","U.S. President Donald Trump (AP Photo/File) U.S. President Donald Trump (AP Photo/File)

U.S. President Donald Trump’s doubts about the war in Afghanistan has led to a delay in completing a new U.S. strategy in South Asia, skepticism that included a suggestion that the U.S. military commander in the region be fired, U.S. officials said on Wednesday. During a July 19 meeting in the White House Situation Room, Trump demanded that his top national security aides provide more information on what one official called “the end-state” in a country where the United States has spent 16 years fighting against the Taliban with no end in sight.

The meeting grew stormy when Trump said Defense Secretary James Mattis and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford, a Marine general, should consider firing Army General John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, for not winning the war.

“We aren’t winning,” he told them, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In addition, once the meeting concluded, Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, got into what one official called “a shouting match” with White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster over the direction of U.S. policy.

Some officials left the meeting “stunned” by the president’s vehement complaints that the military was allowing the United States to lose the war

Mattis, McMaster and other top aides are putting together answers to Trump’s questions in a way to try to get him to approve the strategy, the officials said.

The White House had no comment on the accounts of the meeting.

Another meeting of top aides is scheduled on Thursday.

Although Trump earlier this year gave Mattis the authority to deploy U.S. military forces as he sees fit, in fact the defense secretary’s plans to add around 4,000 more U.S. troops to the 8,400 currently deployed in Afghanistan are being caught up in the delay surrounding the strategy, the officials said.

“It’s been contingent all along informally on the strategy being approved,” a senior administration official said of the troop deployment.

Trump has long been a skeptic of lingering U.S. involvement in foreign wars and has expressed little interest in deploying military forces without a specific plan on what they will do and for how long.

Officials said Trump argued that the United States should demand a share of Afghanistan’s estimated $1 trillion in mineral wealth in exchange for its assistance to the Afghan government. But other officials noted that without securing the entire country, which could take many years, there is no way to get the country’s mineral riches to market, except to Iran. Trump complained that the Chinese are profiting from their mining operations, the officials said.

Man with knife causes flutter as O Panneerselvam arrives,"O Panneerselvam (File Photo) O Panneerselvam (File Photo)

A man allegedly found carrying a kitchen knife caused a flutter at the entrance of the airport in Tiruchirappalli when former Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam was being received on his arrival on Sunday, police said. He was later identified as Solairaja, a local AIADMK worker and supporter of Panneerselvam, they said.

As the AIADMK Puratchi Thalaivi Amma leader was being received by his supporters just outside the arrival entrance, the knife kept by Solairaja in his waist fell down. Immediately, some supporters of Panneerselvam mistook it as an attempt to attack their leader and overpowered Solairaja, stated to be a professional cook, and handed him over to airport police.

During his interrogation, Solairaja told police that he was also a follower of Panneerselvam and did not intend to attack him. He said he always used to keep the knife, police said adding further investigation was on.

Panneerselvam had been accorded CRPF security cover by the Centre from April 2 in the wake of incidents including, hurling of stones on his vehicle after he had revolted against AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala’s leadership in February this year. He arrived in Tiruchirappalli on Sunday to meet his supporters.

Ethiopia’s defending champion Genzebe Dibaba showed the way by winning the first heat in a sharp four minutes 2.67 seconds but jogging in just behind her was Caster Semenya, the South African Olympic 800m champion who is attempting the middle- distance double in London.

Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, owner of the three fastest times this season, won a slower second heat ahead of 2011 world champion Jenny Simpson of the United States but remains favourite, though Kenya’s Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon showed she will be in the mix with a strong run to take the third heat.

There was plenty for the home fans to cheer too with four Britons progressing – Jessica Judd, Laura Muir, Laura Weightman and, with a personal best to snatch a fastest loser slot, Sarah McDonald. The semi-finals take place on Saturday with the final on Monday.

The mother’s legacy: The blue-and-white stripe sari of Saint Teresa is now an intellectual property of Missionaries of Charity,"Spin me a yarn: A nun at the centre. (Express photo by Subham Dutta) Spin me a yarn: A nun at the centre. (Express photo by Subham Dutta)

About 400 workers walk on muddy tracks sandwiched between railway tracks and multiple cow sheds to reach the Gandhiji Prem Nivas Leprosy Centre every day, except Sunday. Here, workers, once leprosy patients who got healed, produce distinctive blue-and-white border saris — they are worn exclusively by Missionaries of Charity (MoC) nuns across 749 centres over 120 countries, including the Vatican City. A five-minute walk from Titagarh Railway Station in North 24 Parganas district, this centre is the only place in the world — run by MoC Sisters and maintained by MoC Brothers, where these unique saris are produced.

Recently, the-blue-and-white sari, first worn by Saint Teresa (known as Mother Teresa before her canonisation last September), has been recognised as the Intellectual Property of the Missionaries of Charity, which was founded by her. The unique pattern is now a registered trademark with the government of India’s Trade Marks Registry and no one can use that border design without the permission of the MoC.

According to the official website of Mother Teresa of Calcutta Centre, the Mother used to buy these saris from Harrison Road (now known as Mahatma Gandhi Road) in Kolkata in 1948. The three blue borders of the sari signify the vows that the nuns at MoC take. “The first band represents poverty, the second obedience, and, the third broad band represents the vows of chastity and wholehearted service to the poorest of the poor,” says Brother Harry D’Souza, in-charge of the handloom at the Centre. Saint Teresa and the MoC nuns continued wearing the saris till it became very difficult to get them in large numbers.

Eventually, the MoC, which had set up Gandhiji Prem Nivas Leprosy Centre in 1979 for leprosy patients, decided to give these patients the work of weaving this particular saris for its nuns. “Since then, these patients weave the saris. But they are not sold to outsiders. Only MoC nuns get to wear them once they take their first vow after five years of training. This is the only place in the world which produces this sari,” says the director of the Centre, Brother Marianus.

The workers get Rs 6,000 per month, and, sometimes, a bonus if they produce more saris. “We also provide food, clothing and medical care. We have set up three nivas (quarter) for them. Those who have settled outside the centre come regularly to work here,” says Marianus.

Out of 50 looms at the Centre, only seven are used for weaving the saris, which are called Sister Saris. “Besides Sister Saris, workers here produce bedsheets, bandages and uniforms for leprosy patients at various centres,” says D’Souza.

Mithun Haldar, 26, who has worked at the Centre for the last 10 years, was happy to learn that the border of the Sisters Saris has been recognised as the intellectual property of MoC. “It is good to know that no one except us can make these saris now,” he says.

“I had come here as a patient in 1978. When the centre was set up, I was given a job. Since then I have been working here,” says Shefali Roy who has been associated with the centre for the last 40 years.

After the completion of the weaving processes, the saris are sent for packaging. The packed saris are then sent to Nirmala Shishu Bhavan at Lower Circular Road in Kolkata from where the saris are distributed to the centres of MoC across the world.

Author Akhil Sharma talks about short stories and compelling characters,"The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo) The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo)

The greatest challenge for a short story writer, says one of the foremost names in the field — who might not be too well known in India but has built up an impressive resume in the US — is to stick to its ideal length, with the writer captivating his readers in a way that they have no desire for more.

“Knowing that a story is only 15 or 20 pages means that you are restricted in how many characters you can have or situations you can entertain. This means that the entry into the story has to be so strong that the reader has no desire for more,” Akhil Sharma told IANS in an email interview from New York.

The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. He maintained that once a writer goes beyond this length, the stories begin to take the shape of novellas. But temptation is always lurking around the corner.

“The problem is that characters can be so compelling that one feels the need to follow them,” he quipped.

Delhi-born Sharma, who emigrated to the United States in 1979, is certainly not among the most well-known faces of our literary fraternity but the illustrious career of this prolific author is still a distant dream for many writers.

His stories have been published in the New Yorker and Atlantic Monthly, and included in “The Best American Short Stories” and “O. Henry Prize Collections”. Sharma’s first book, “An Obedient Father”, won the PEN/Hemingway Award in 2001. His second novel, “Family Life” won the Folio Prize in 2015 and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2016. “I began writing ‘We Didn’t Like Him’ the day after I handed in my novel ‘Family Life’. I began it with the idea that I just wanted a story with a beginning, middle and end. I had the opening line and I had an idea for someone who wants to be a televangelist.

“I then just began describing the character and trying to make him sympathetic. Part of this meant inventing his back story and what would be natural for him as his life progressed. I wrote one ending and it didn’t satisfy me and so I wrote another,” the author said on being asked to throw light on the journey of a short story — from the time of its inception to its fulfilment.

“We Didn’t Like Him”, along with seven others, comprise his latest book. Titled “A Life of Adventure and Delight” (Penguin/Rs 599/190 Pages), the book is a collection of stories that focus on Indians at home and abroad and plunge the reader into what Sharma calls the unpredictable workings of the human heart.

Sharma said that he loves short stories. “They are demanding and fun and there is the sense that unlike a novel, one is not held hostage by them,” he elaborated. The author further shared that his short stories have become looser with time. “They cover longer periods. I find that the transition between my paragraphs is not as tight. More and more I think short stories are simply narratives where an event occurs and a character changes or does not change even though we would expect him to,” he contended.

Sharma hoped that short stories are published in newspapers like they used to be in the past, adding that they have a specific place in the world and will always remain relevant.

BMC to set up special tent for international tourists,"Preparation on the way for Anant Chaturdashi Immersion Day in Girgaon Chowpatty on Thursday. (Express Photo by Prashant Nadkar) Preparation on the way for Anant Chaturdashi Immersion Day in Girgaon Chowpatty on Thursday. (Express Photo by Prashant Nadkar)

In order to attract more international tourists for Ganesh Chaturthi, the city’s most popular festival, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is planning to set up a tent at Girgaon Chowpatty on the immersion days. The civic body will set up the tent along with the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation to create a safe environment for tourists. Municipal Commissioner Ajoy Mehta, during the monthly meeting held on Saturday, issued a direction to set up a tent for foreign tourists who come to Mumbai to witness the festival every year on the days of the immersion.

The tent will contain facilities like mobile toilets, wifi connection as well as clean drinking water. “Tourists can watch the immersion of the Ganpati idols from across the city on the 7th and 11th days and they can use the wifi connection to send out pictures. The tent will be set up near the two others designated for the police on surveillance duty,” said a civic official. Meanwhile, to reduce the risk of accidents caused by gas cylinders being used by hawkers on the streets, Mehta has ordered all the ward officials to submit a police complaint against the distributor or the company supplying the cylinders to them. In order to follow the norms of the Swachh Bharat initiative, it will be mandatory for hawkers selling food items to keep dustbins near their stalls.

Addressing the rising number of cases of dengue and malaria in the city, the BMC has decided to conduct pest control at abandoned buildings in the city. During the meeting on Saturday, Mehta instructed his staff to appoint a pest control agency to deal with the mosquito menace at the old mill structures and uninhabited dilapidated buildings. “The agency will cover all the abandoned buildings and the cost will be recovered by adding it to the property tax of the owners of those properties,” said an official.

"Pope Francis ‘loves China’, Vatican official says on trip to China","Pope Francis. (AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino) Pope Francis. (AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino)

Pope Francis “loves China” and the Vatican hopes China has a great future, a Chinese state-run newspaper on Friday cited a visiting Vatican official as saying, in an expression of goodwill despite strained relations between the two. Pope Francis would like to heal a decades-old rift with China, where Catholics are divided between those loyal to him and those who belong to a government-controlled official church.

In June, China said it opposed outside interference in its internal affairs after the Vatican expressed concern about a Chinese bishop it said had been “removed”. Speaking in Beijing where he was attending an organ transplant conference, the head of the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Monsignor Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, expressed the Pope’s goodwill, the state-run Global Times reported.

“Pope Francis loves China and loves the people of China, its history and population. We hope China can have a great future,” the paper quoted him as saying. In February, China’s Foreign Ministry downplayed the significance of a top health official’s attendance at a Vatican conference on organ trafficking, saying it probably had nothing to do with two-way ties.

One obstacle to better relations is the question of who should make senior clerical appointments in China. China says bishops must be named by the Chinese Catholic community and refuses to accept the authority of the pope, whom it sees as the head of a foreign state that has no right to meddle in China’s affairs.

The two sides have been at loggerheads since the expulsion of foreign missionaries from China after the Communists took power in 1949. Another source of friction is the Vatican’s maintenance of official ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a wayward province to be taken back by force if necessary.

"This will be the most difficult season of my career, says Antonio Conte","Antonio Conte says he is not satisfied with the depth of his squad. (Source: Reuters) Antonio Conte says he is not satisfied with the depth of his squad. (Source: Reuters)

The European transfer market is witnessing huge amounts of money being splurged for top stars and players. However, one man who seems visibly frustrated by transfer miscues is Chelsea coach, Antonio Conte. Thereby he has also admitted that the season could be tough for his side. Conte is reportedly annoyed by Chelsea’s inability to land his key transfer targets.

In a recent chat with the media, he said, “For me, it will be the most difficult season of my career. I’m sure about this,” and added, There are many reasons that suggest to me next season will be very tough. I have this perception. I hope I am mistaken. In England the pressure is high. This league is the strongest in the world. You have six teams ready to fight for the title and only one wins it. You want to fight until the end for the title, but it won’t be easy.”

While Chelsea has already spending a significant amount on players like Alvaro Morata, Tiemoue Bakayoko, coach Conte is still not satisfied and believes his squad is still lacking in depth.

Looking towards the possible solution, Conte said, “We have to wait for the best moment, the best solution. Everyone is trying to do their job. My job is to work and to try to improve my players, to create an identity for my team. For the rest I can tell my opinion, but then there is the club to make the final decision. In this moment we have a small squad. Everyone can see the situation, not because the coach shouts ‘I want this and this’. This is the reality. We hope in the future to improve this situation.”

"Vijender Singh vs Zulipikaer Maimaitiali: Near the sea-face, a face-off in Mumbai","Vijender Singh and Zulpilkar Maimaitiali were involved in a weigh-in and face-off for ‘Battleground Asia’ bout in Mumbai. (Source: PTI) Vijender Singh and Zulpilkar Maimaitiali were involved in a weigh-in and face-off for ‘Battleground Asia’ bout in Mumbai. (Source: PTI)

At an elite club in Mumbai, where the well-heeled dress up to look their glam best, a set of professional boxers stripped right down to their briefs to kick-start the weekend. The makeshift platform at a mini-theatre served as the stage for the final pre-bout weigh-ins. The athletes included the two who will feature in the main event, China’s Zulipikaer Maimaitiali, and India’s 2008 Olympic bronze medallist Vijender Singh. Dressed down in nothing but their basics — and remarkably, their headphones — Maimaitiali and Vijender’s face-off proved to be a rather jovial affair. The two spoke to each other, smiles galore, and then a friendly handshake.

Inside the Sardar Vallabhai Patel Stadium next to the theater, a rectangle was chalked out on the stone floor to mark where the boxing ring will be set up for the following night’s entertainment. Equal care was taken to mark where the VVIP stands would be put up, after all, there is a grand list that is expected to turn up for Vijender’s ninth professional bout. This is to be his most glamourous fight ever.

Vijender’s ninth professional bout will be his third on home-soil, but the first in Mumbai. The 31-year-old is well acquainted with the city, for it was here that he became only the second Indian Olympian (after Leander Paes) to have made a temporary switch from sport to the silver screen.

If his bronze medal at Beijing didn’t give him the glamour the achievement deserved, his foray into Bollywood surely did.

And now that elite community will serve him again. “Mumbai has the glam factor,” says Nirav Tomar, CEO of the company that manages Vijender. “It’s the pinnacle city of India, which has a high commercial and entertainment value. So it’s always expensive.”

The pugilist’s previous two bouts were in New Delhi, where the required bouncers were ordered to patrol an array of political bigwigs along with a smaller star-cast. But glamour comes easy to Mumbai. In India, pro boxing needs the glitz, and glamour does not waste the opportunity to share the spotlight.

The likes of Ranbir Kapoor, Kapil Sharma and Anu Malik are expected to be there. As is yoga guru Baba Ramdev and India’s first Grand Slam champion Mahesh Bhupathi. Then there is the entire Bachchan family – the ultimate benchmark.

There’s an additional list of 20 more that make up the crème of Mumbai, but as is customary for such a star-studded event, the names ‘cannot be disclosed.’

“There’s a greater connect people have with Bollywood stars than with big political names. So having a bout in Mumbai was the obvious next step in Vijender’s career path,” Tomar adds.

“This will be his last bout in India for a while, so we’re hoping to leave with a bang.”

Inside the venue, after the weigh-ins, the undress and re-dress, Vijender’s coach Lee Beard wants to talk boxing, as he analyses each opponent’s game. “Zulipikaer’s got decent jabs and a decent round-hook. But he only goes on one speed and likes to be fast,” he says.

“Vijender is an experienced Olympian and has a good boxing brain. He knows when to take his time and when to pull the trigger. He knows how to disarm an opponent, control the opponent with skill and when to attack.”

What makes the bout even more crucial, is that each opponent comes with a title that will be put on the line. Maimaitiali is the WBO Oriental champion, while Vijender holds the WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title.

But Beard pips the odds in his ward’s favour, given Vijender’s vast experience compared to his 23-year-old opponent. It’s what helped him get through his first match in Delhi, when he won his title.

“He was aware of the expectations since it was his first title. But he had the ability to do the distance against Kerry Hope. It was all about dominating each of the 10 rounds, and he did that,” says Beard. “In his next match, (a knockout win against Francis Cheka) it was all about that one punch. A boxer doesn’t get paid to fight 10 rounds, he gets paid to win.”

The experience might be required to bail him out again, given the elite line-up of stars that will be guided to the their ringside seats. “In all the great boxing venues of the world, Las Vegas or in Europe, fights attract a star audience,” says Tomar. Though Vijender and Maimaitiali are still small names when it comes to the pro circuit, the host city provides the glamour of a major sporting event.

On Saturday, at a venue just off the Worli sea-face, a celebrity cast from various fields will turn out. There will be glitz, glamour, lots of money. And yes, there will be boxing too.

Ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections in the state, the Congress on Saturday demanded security for its 44 Congress MLAs, “fearing an attack on them due to the deteriorating law and order in the state”. The MLAs, who have been camping at a Bengaluru resort for the last one week as the party feared poaching attempts by the BJP, are set to return on Sunday to take part in the polls.

In a letter to Assembly Speaker Ramanlal Vora, Chief Secretary J N Singh and DGP Geetha Johri, Congress chief whip Shailesh Parmar sought security for the MLAs from the time they land at the Ahmedabad airport on August 6 till they reach their homes on August 9 after the Rajya Sabha elections on Tuesday. “The security is required because of the fear of attack on the legislators or their kidnapping owing to deteriorating law and order situation in the state,” Parmar said, pointing to Friday’s attack on party vice-president Rahul Gandhi.

Meanwhile, Congress MLA from Abdasa, Shaktisinh Gohil, tweeted video messages of his party MLAs to show that all was well in the Congress. In the videos, the 44 MLAs reiterated their resolve to vote for the party’s sole nominee, Ahmed Patel.

"China daily warns of PLA might, ‘small-scale operation in 2 weeks’","An editorial in the Saturday issue of Global Times also said the PLA had made “sufficient preparation for military confrontation”. An editorial in the Saturday issue of Global Times also said the PLA had made “sufficient preparation for military confrontation”.

China is planning a “small-scale military operation” to “expel” Indian troops from the Doklam area “within two weeks”, an article in the State-run Global Times said here Saturday. “China will not allow the military standoff between China and India in Doklam to last for too long, and there may be a small-scale military operation to expel Indian troops within two weeks, Chinese experts said after six ministries and institutions made remarks on the incident within the past 24 hours,” the article in the daily run by the Communist Party of China said.

Quoting Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow at the Institute of International Relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, the article said, “The series of remarks from the Chinese side within a 24-hour period sends a signal to India that there is no way China will tolerate the Indian troops’ incursion into Chinese territory for too long.”

“The Chinese side will inform the Indian Foreign Ministry before its operation,” he told Global Times. Hu also said India would have to “bear all the consequences”, and that ties between the two countries were “severely damaged”. While there was no official response from the Ministry of External Affairs, Indian government sources downplayed the threat and said they did not wish to add anything beyond what was said by ministry spokesperson Gopal Baglay on Friday and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Thursday. “We have already said that war is not an option, and diplomatic channels are being used to defuse the situation. I think we will stick to that position, and not respond to such provocative articles in the Chinese media,” a top Indian diplomat said.

An Indian source well-networked into the Chinese think-tank circuit told The Sunday Express that Hu is “a known India-baiter”, but “does not speak for the Chinese military establishment”. “I have met him at several conferences in China, he is quite condescending towards India, and negative in his views. But he is not a surrogate for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA),” he said, adding that Hu belongs to a provincial think-tank and not a Central think-tank.

An editorial in the Saturday issue of Global Times also said the PLA had made “sufficient preparation for military confrontation”. “It is a war with an obvious result,” the editorial said. “The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be aware of the PLA’s overwhelming firepower and logistics. Indian border troops are no rival to PLA field forces. If a war spreads, the PLA is perfectly capable of annihilating all Indian troops in the border region.”

Over Thursday and Friday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence have released statements on the ongoing Doklam stand-off. According to Global Times, the military operation would aim to seize Indian personnel “illegally lingering” in Chinese territory. The article also mentioned “exercises” in Tibet. “China Central Television reported Friday that the Tibet military region conducted live fire exercises in recent days in Tibet. The exercise began at 4 am. A group swiftly took ground and loaded ammunition. The firing began just after dawn. The army used different ways to attack the same target.”

Zhao Gancheng, the director of the Center for Asia-Pacific Studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, was quoted as telling Global Times, “The exercises are a sign that China could use military means to end the standoff and the chances of doing so are increasing as the Indian side is still saying one thing and doing another.”

About Zhao, Indian sources said that while he is a respected India hand, he was reiterating the Chinese government position. “He is a reputed expert, probably approaching retirement. But he too is a provincial think-tank expert, and is essentially repeating what Chinese diplomats and officials have been saying. There is nothing new,” sources said.

According to the article, the patience of China and its public was “wearing thin” and it did not want the dispute to “impact” the upcoming BRICS Summit, which India will attend in the first week of September. “India, which has stirred up the incident, should bear all the consequences. And no matter how the standoff ends, Sino-Indian ties have been severely damaged and strategic distrust will linger,” Hu told Global Times.

The Doklam stand-off began in mid-June when Indian troops stopped the PLA from constructing a road in the area. While Bejiing claims the region as sovereign Chinese territory, India says the area lies at the trijunction of China, India and Bhutan, and it had been decided that no country would take unilateral action *there.

Just right for kids: Life’s Like That,"Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls

Book name: Good Night Stories For Rebel Girls

Author: Elena Favilli & Francesca Cavallo

Publisher: Particular Books

Pages: 212

Price: Rs 799

Appropriate for: 8+

A game of How to Spot Gender Stereotyping in Everyday Life was never considered an essential sport for young people, possibly because there’s little hope of redemption in a world that likes its little women colour-coded and organised in various shades of docility, thank you very much. An initial $1 million Kickstarter campaign encouraged authors Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo to counter stereotyping with this delightful anti-princess book of modern fairy tales that tells its young readers to “Dream bigger, aim higher fight harder. And, when in doubt, remember, you are right.”

Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls puts together the inspiring stories of 100 women who went against the grain to lead the lives they wanted. From mathematician Ada Lovelace to the partially-sighted Cuban ballerina Alicia Alonso, from tennis champions Venus and Serena Williams to warrior queen Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi, there is an interesting and representative mix of ethnicities, nationalities and eras from which these women are chosen. The production quality is excellent as is the extremely well-curated collection of illustrations, sourced from artists across the world.

There are a couple of minor gripes — the perseverance of PV Sindhu or Dipa Karmakar make for as fascinating a story as that of Rani Lakshmi Bai when it comes to India, and, leaving out JK Rowling from the pantheon seems a bit of a travesty. But these are fairy tales that need to be added to, to be debated over and to be treasured because it tells its readers — boys and girls both, hurrah — that to choose your own happily ever after, all you need is yourself.

“When we are small, we need someone to hold our hand in the dark,” writes Ruskin Bond, flaneur to generations of Indian readers, in this slim memoir, a tribute to his father, Aubrey Bond, an officer in the Codes and Ciphers section of the Royal Air Force in the early 1940s. In the time following the separation of his parents, the young Bond is sent off to Delhi to be with his father. Freed from the tyranny of boarding school, it is a summer of many firsts for the young boy. Delhi, far from the urban sprawl that it is today, was a place of wonder for the boy from the hills. Over cinema, books, music, long walks and lots of tea with condensed milk, he would come to share a bond of deep trust and affection with his father, make friends and learn lessons of a lifetime.

But, unknown to him, this is also to be a period of brief reprieve for Bond. The world outside is changing faster than an eight-year-old’s imagination — World War II is nearing its bitter end and the struggle for Independence intensifying in India. Soon, he will return to boarding school in Simla and his father posted to Calcutta. And then, one fine day, in the middle of a marathon, he will be summoned by his teacher to be given the news that will break his young heart: his father was no more.

Paired with Mihir Joglekar’s endearing illustrations, this poignant memoir, Bond’s first for children, looks back at the most treasured relationship of his life with disarming candour, customary wit and a complete absence of bitterness.

If death is bewildering for grown-ups, how can children face up to it? Learning to deal with loss is never easy, but children’s literature in particular, rarely deals with the inevitability of death or coming to terms with grief. Over the last few years, however, a bunch of thoughtful picture books such as Oliver Jeffers’s The Heart and the Bottle and Rebecca Cobb’s Missing Mommy have explored the void created by the death of a loved one. Indian picture books, however, have rarely ventured into this zone, barring a few stray forays like My Grandfather Aajoba by Taruja Parande.

In the years since Richa Jha launched her independent publishing house Pickle Yolk Books, she has put together a small but well-curated list of books dealing with diversity, differences and now, death. Her new book is the story of Noorie, who has lost her sister Zoya, but finds herself unprepared for the overwhelming void it opens up in her life. She watches over her mother and her pet, Bruno, scared that they would leave her, too, frequents their favourite haunts where Zoya’s presence still lingers in the air. But, most of all, she is overcome by anger at her sister’s disappearance; at the overtures of Zoya’s best friend Dhara to draw her out, and, at her mother’s insistence that Zoya would always be a part of their lives.

Gautam Benegal’s evocative illustrations are the highlight of this beautiful volume. He captures Zoya’s disorientation and the messy nature of grief with great subtlety, aided in no small part by Jha’s economy of words and quiet understanding of the hollowness that loss engenders.

Book name: This Truck Has Got to be Special

Author: Anjum Rana

Publisher: Tara Books

Pages: 56

Price: Rs 550

Appropriate for: 13+

When Chinar Gul, a Pakistani truck driver from the Swat Valley, finally acquires the truck that he has driven for the last five years, he takes it to his friend, truck artist Zarrar in Taxila, for a makeover. As Zarrar gets to work, Gul, who drives along the scenic mountain roads of the Karakoram and the Hindu Kush, looks back at his humble beginnings as a cleaner and the many journeys he has undertaken since that have shaped him as an individual.

Gul’s reminiscences take the reader on trips along the Grand Trunk Road “that runs all the way from Karachi in the south to Kabul in the north-west”, stopping by the Kabul and Indus rivers for a spot of fishing or a quick shuteye at the dhabas around the bends. He travels along the “Roof of the World”, the Pakistan-China road that leads from Kashgar in China’s Xinjiang to Abbottabad in Pakistan, infamous as the last hideout of Osama bin Laden. Pakistani writer and truck art entrepreneur Rana’s narrative is tightly focused on the landscape and the lives of those who ply along these routes. But alongside, she also offers an exposition on South Asia’s rich history of truck art that combines calligraphy, painting and metal work to give the lumbering vehicles a colourful, distinctive look.

As is the nature of Tara publications, this collaboration between Rana, truck artists Hakeem Nawaz and Amer Khan and Indian illustrator Sameer Kulavoor offers a syncretic work that is both a celebration of and a tribute to the rich imagination and craftsmanship that contribute to the vibrancy of truck art.

Book name: Eighteen Tides and a Tiger

Author: Anjana Basu

Publisher: TERI

Pages: 140

Price: Rs 250

Appropriate for: 12+

Kolkata-based author Anjana Basu’s third novel in her Jim Corbett series takes a young adult Rohan to the Sunderbans on his first internship with the forest department. It’s a forest unlike anything Rohan has ever seen, familiar as he is with those in the Kumaon region, the land of “dry-footed” tigers. Out here in the Gangetic delta, amphibious tigers climb trees, the evil spirit of Dakhin Rai lures unsuspecting villagers to maneaters and the spirit of Bonbibi, benevolent deity and protector of the tigers, looms large over the mangrove forests. Rohan’s visit is not short of adventures, particularly when he finds himself stranded ashore after a foolhardy stroll in the forest. There are also tigers aplenty, rescue missions, and, a mysterious little girl who appears in times of distress.

One of the reasons why such books are important is because they serve as handy introductions to our unique ecosystems and give an insight into the need to maintain environmental balance. Tiger conservation, in particular, has received overwhelming publicity and support. Perhaps, if the same could be extended to other environmental causes, there would be a less foolhardy generation who will treat their environment with the respect it deserves.

Orissa High Court orders for second JEE to fill up vacant B Tech seats,"There are 88 private and eight government colleges in the state. There are 88 private and eight government colleges in the state.

The Orissa High Court today ordered the state government to conduct second Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) of the year to fill up huge vacancies of B Tech and MCA seats in both government and private engineering colleges. Adjudicating over a petition of OPECA (Odisha Private Engineering College Association), a division bench headed by Chief Justice Vineet Saran asked the state government to hold the supplementary examination only to fill up the vacant seats in the reserved categories.

Accordingly, the government has been asked to issue the notification for the examination by August 5 and complete the entire admission process by August 14.

As per a recent report by Odisha TV, nearly 94 per cent seats remain vacant even after completion of first phase of admissions. OPECA believes fake placement issue has affected the admissions.

They had appealed to the government as well.

According to reports, out of the total 43,000 seats, about 8,151 seats have been allotted in the engineering colleges. There are 88 private and eight government colleges in the state. There have been no takers for the BTech courses in at least eight colleges this time.

Kamal Haasan threatens to quit Bigg Boss Tamil. Here’s why,"Kamal Haasan said he felt responsible for the blunder and thought he owed an apology to the viewers. Kamal Haasan said he felt responsible for the blunder and thought he owed an apology to the viewers.

Movie demigod Kamal Haasan began the Saturday’s episode with a warning to showrunners. He threatened to quit the show as its host, should they include a socially irresponsible task in the future.

For the uninitiated, the show received a lot of flak after the housemates were asked to dress up and behave like mentally challenged persons in the recent episodes. The task was criticised as insensitive and indifferent to people with mental issues.

Even Kamal took exception to the task. And the 62-year-old actor said he was not part of planning day-to-day activities inside the Bigg House house during the weekdays. He added that still he felt responsible for the blunder and thought he owed an apology to the viewers. “The task that made fun of mentally challenged people was not in a good taste. And I’m actually angry about it. We all have social responsibilities,” he rued.

He opined that the issues related to mental illness were not something that should be taken lightly. “You may ask me, why have you not acted a mentally disturbed person in your films? That type of character in my films will not be used for comic relief. He will be the protagonist,” he added.

“I request them (Bigg Boss team) not to repeat such activities on the show hereafter. If it happens again, this show is not important to me,” he said in uncertain terms.

It takes a lot of courage to a man of his stature to admit when he was part of something that was not correct. He is called Ulaganayagan (Universal Hero) for a reason.

After being part of the film industry for more than 50 years, Kamal made his small screen debut with the first season of Bigg Boss Tamil in June. The show has been reeling under a series of controversies, legal problems and threats from members of various fringe groups in Tamil Nadu. At the same time, it is also currently the most talked-about television show with more than 3.6 crore viewers tuning in every day.

PKL season 5: Tamil Thalaivas’ late surge not enough in Bengaluru Bulls defeat,"Bulls were All-Out for the first time in the match and the score was 30-18. (Source: PKL) Bulls were All-Out for the first time in the match and the score was 30-18. (Source: PKL)

Tamil Thalaivas scored 23 points in a single half against Bengaluru Bulls. But that came on the back of a first half performance so bad that they ended up losing the match by a point. The Thalaivas were bossed by Bengaluru Bulls in the first half. They forced two all outs and seldom gave any points away while defending. This meant that the final score at the end of the match was 32-31 in favour of the Bulls. As Thakur would later admit in the post match press conference, it was their horror show in the first half that chiefly cost them the match.

The first three raids of the match were all empty ones and that was the only time when Tamil Thalaivas and Bengaluru Bulls were well and truly on level terms in that first half. Rohit Kumar got the first point of the match. Ajay Thakur, on the other hand, was dismissed in his next raid. It was the story of the first half. Rohit Kumar was successful in getting points during his raids while Ajay Thakur was anything but. So poor were the Thalaivas in defence that they were All-Out twice in the first half itself. Bengaluru Bulls were just as nippy with their corners closing in on the raider as soon as the opportunity presented itself. At half time, the score was 23-8 in favour of the Bengaluru Bulls.

It looked like the match is well and truly sealed at that point. No team could possibly overturn a 15-point deficit. But that is almost what the Thalaivas managed to achieve. They took the first three points of the second half. Bengaluru then pulled further away when they Super Tackled Ajay Thakur. But then, the Thalaivas kept at it. They were a different team in the second half. The corners were sharper and they were showing more urgency in their raids. They also started getting the points to show and soon scored as many in the first 10 minutes of the second half as they managed in the entirety of the first.

Soon, the Bulls were All-Out for the first time in the match and the score was 30-18. Nine minutes remained in the match. Thakur then managed two points in his raid which took the Thalaivas’ total to 21. A tackle on Rohit Kumar then took the score to 31-22 with five minutes remaining. Suddenly, it seemed possible. Despite the odds being stacked against them, the Thalaivas were putting in all the preparations of turning the tables on Bengaluru.

They managed to inflict a second all out and the score became 31-28. A succesfull raid by Prapanjan and a technical point brought the Thalaivas’ score to 30. Rohit Kumar then raided sucesfully, completing his Super 10. It would prove to be one of the most important points for Bengaluru in the entire match. That took Bengaluru’s tally to 32, just one more than what the Thalaivas managed before the end of the second half.

Border Dispatch,"Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan.

Meena Menon was The Hindu’s correspondent in Islamabad for only nine months (August, 2013 to May, 2014) before she was kicked out. It is astonishing to learn from this memoir of how, in such a short time, her empathetic interest in anything and everything Pakistani enabled her to rise well above routine reporting (and routine harassment) to range across virtually the entire gamut of life as it is actually lived in that “distant neighbour” of ours.

Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. With a keen eye, a sharp ear, an open mind and a large heart, she kept in good cheer whatever the hurdles, made numerous friends, met everyone from top politicians to the proverbial taxi driver, wandered the by-lanes, shopped in different markets, explored the eating places, and did the sights, going to mosques and temples and churches around the capital.

Of course, she filed her regular reports, dutifully attended foreign office briefings, and informed her readers of political events and the proceedings in the National Assembly (Parliament). But she also immersed herself into Pakistan’s rich cultural life, interacted with artistes, painters, writers, social workers, political activists, fellow-journalists, and, of course, the aam admi. Instead of only obsessing over the India-Pakistan relationship, as many Indian reporters and most Indian diplomats do, it was Pakistan as a nation and a society, and Pakistanis as a people, who interested her. And, amusingly, she never allowed her minders, the two security guys who relentlessly trailed her (and whom she nick-named “Beard” and “Chubby”) to faze her or derail her from her purpose.

This is what makes this book so special: it takes in all the political and economic see-saw in Pakistan itself, and in our relationship with Pakistan, but rising above both the pride and the prejudice that often overwhelm our perceptions of that country, she unhesitatingly presents both the warts and the astonishing resilience of a people fighting fierce odds.

“I could walk around,” she writes, “and meet nice people”. “I had many friends and they were always helpful and kind”. She talks of “a senior politician who treated me like his daughter”. “Many parliamentarians were friendly,” she remarks, “even if they made anti-Indian statements.” A startling revelation is that “one place we felt quite welcome was the foreign office”! Elsewhere, she remarks, “this unconditional affection and warmth is overwhelming”. “Pakistani writers and journalists were always accessible” and “helped me understand their country”. She names a whole sheaf of them. She recounts her encounters with the wife of a Pakistani army general, Indu Mitha, who teaches “Bharatanatyam to enthusiastic Pakistanis” and Shenaz Minallah who, despite an attempt to burn down her headquarters, continues to run the Pakistan branch of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s “Art of Living”: “We do courses in mostly three cities and from twenty-odd people the number has swelled to over eighty per session”. There is a moving account of her friendship with the great Sufi singer, Abida Parveen, who says of her hopes for India and Pakistan: “Love is a force, it’s like the sea, it cannot break”. She interviews the Baloch Gandhi, Mama Qadeer, the proximate cause of her expulsion. And she admires Shoaib Sultan Khan, a development activist, “The Man from Pakistan”, who has done outstanding rural development work in Andhra Pradesh. She records, without further comment, Shoaib’s assessment of Rahul Gandhi who was much taken with his work: “this young man has his heart in the right place to do something for the poor”.

She contrasts “most of the media portrayal reinforcing the image of a backward and failed state” with “visitors (who) are pleasantly surprised when they see glimpses of a country that is different from what they think it is.” While surveying the many vicious disabilities to which the minorities are subjected (the Ahmedias are the worst treated, “the community lives on the razor’s edge”) she also finds space for “Pandit Chamanlal from Rawalpindi” asserting, somewhat startlingly, that “the Hindu community was not targeted in any way”.

Yet, she is no starry-eyed romantic. She sees the downside clearly: the “deep state” and its connections to terrorism; the persecution of Baloch dissidents and the atrocities inflicted on them; the blatant misuse of blasphemy laws; the sickening treatment of people with different sexual orientations; the awful collateral damage caused by drones; the soaring crime rate. There are graphic descriptions of suicide bomb blasts in the heart of Islamabad to which she was personal witness; and grim stories of mindless cruelty, murder and mayhem.

Her undiluted admiration is reserved for Pakistani journalists. “Journalists can be shot, kidnapped, threatened and abused…life hung on a thread”. Yet, “journalism in Pakistan has been bold and brave”. She concludes, “The government and the security empire have the upper hand. Yet, with all the powers at their command, they have not crushed the free spirit of the people who write and report at will”.

Meena Menon was unceremoniously thrown out of Pakistan in under a year. She harbours no bitterness. Balanced as ever, she remarks, of herself and the treatment meted out to Pak journalists in India: “there is no low both countries cannot stoop to.” Her final message is: “there is a call for peace and reason, however faint it may be, and it is coming from an invisible majority which is yet to come into its own”.

Manish Sisodia writes to Prakash Javadekar: ‘No-detention policy was badly implemented’,"Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia and HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia and HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia Thursday wrote to Union Human Resource Development (HRD) minister Prakash Javadekar regarding the cabinet’s decision to roll back the ‘No-Detention Policy’ as part of the Right to Education Act. While he said the move was “needed”, he also stressed that it was “unfortunate” since its implementation had been “poor and thoughtless”.

“This decision was needed as an emergency measure to end the current crisis across the country, where academic standards of schools are rapidly deteriorating. The Delhi Assembly has also passed a bill for the rollback of the no-detention policy. We hope to hear from you soon regarding the details of the implementation, so that (the)academic session does not get affected,” wrote Sisodia.

“However, the roll back of this important reform is also a moment for us to introspect about the education reform in the country. The ‘no-detention policy’ was a progressive education reform and it is unfortunate that we had to roll it back. And the reason we had to do this is because it was poorly and thoughtlessly implemented. For this policy to have been successful, the government needed to change the curriculum, improve assessments, train teachers — none of which was done… The tragedy of government schools in India is that most reforms are poorly implemented and the quality of education in our school keeps deteriorating,” he wrote.

Five-year jail to man for sexually assaulting minor girl,"It was also alleged in the complaint that the man threatened the child with a knife and warned of killing her if she disclosed the matter to anyone. (Representational Image) It was also alleged in the complaint that the man threatened the child with a knife and warned of killing her if she disclosed the matter to anyone. (Representational Image)

A 32-year-old man has been sent to jail for five years by a Delhi court for sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl and threatening to kill her if she disclosed the incident to anyone. Additional Sessions Judge Ashwani Kumar Sarpal, while awarding 5 years of rigorous imprisonment and imposing a fine of Rs 10,000 on east Delhi resident Dashrath, held him guilty under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

“When the statement of victim and other witnesses is reliable, then delay in reporting the matter to police is not a serious issue. Otherwise also, this delay is only of two days which can be pardoned in the present facts and circumstances where the heinous offence was committed with a minor aged about eight years,” the court said.

According to the complaint filed by the child’s mother, on June 13, 2014, Dashrath grabbed the girl and tried to remove her clothes while she was playing on the terrace of her house. It was also alleged in the complaint that the man threatened the child with a knife and warned of killing her if she disclosed the matter to anyone.

“It appears that victim could not tell about the incident even to her parents immediately due to fear of the accused. The threats were very apparent and had affected the victim badly because she started weeping loudly when her mother took her to the house of the accused after coming to know about the incident two days later,” the court observed.

Dashrath, however, denied all the allegations and claimed innocence. He also told the court that he had some dispute with the maternal uncle of the child which had led to the filing of this case. The court after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the statements of the victim and the witnesses, sentenced him to five years in jail.

Turkey warns new military moves in Syria imminent,"Turkey’s Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan. (Source: Reuters) Turkey’s Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan. (Source: Reuters)

Turkey’s president reiterated that new cross-border operations into Syria are in the works as the country boosts its military presence along the border against threats from Kurdish militants in war-torn Syria.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey is determined to launch “new moves” akin to its foray into northern Syria last August. “It’s clear that the situation in Syria goes beyond a war on a terror organization,” Erdogan said on Saturday, referring to the Islamic State group, and alluding to Kurdish aspirations for statehood.

He was addressing a large crowd at a stadium opening in eastern Malatya province, and slammed the US-led campaign against IS in Syria.

Turkey has been vehemently opposed to the presence of the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, in northern Syria. The Syrian Kurdish militants are a key US ally in the fight against IS in Syria, and the ongoing campaign to retake the extremist group’s de-facto capital of Raqqa.

But Turkey, a NATO member, considers the YPG to be a terror group and an extension of Kurdish militants that have waged a three-decades-long insurgency inside its borders. The country fears that the Syrian Kurds will attempt to link its semi-autonomous regions in northern Syria, which Erdogan calls a “terror entity project” that threatens his country.

In last year’s cross-border operation dubbed Euphrates Shield, Turkey-backed Syrian opposition groups and the Turkish military cleared an area in northern Syria of IS and prevented the YPG from conjoining its territories.

“We would rather pay the price for spoiling plans against our future and liberty in Syria and Iraq rather than on our own soil,” Erdogan said today.

“Soon we will take new and important steps,” he announced. Turkey’s official Anadolu news agency said Saturday that the military dispatched artillery to the border province of Kilis to reinforce units there.

The six-vehicle convoy included tanks and howitzers to be positioned across from the Kurdish-controlled Syrian region of Afrin, according to the private Dogan news agency.

In late April, Turkey began relocating military units to Sanliurfa province across from another YPG-controlled area.

From Planning Commission To Niti Aayog: Life comes a full circle for Dr Vinod Paul,"Vinod Paul Vinod Paul

From a member of the High Level Expert Group on Universal Health Coverage formed by the erstwhile Planning Commission to becoming the first medical expert member of its successor, the Niti Aayog, life has come a full circle for Dr Vinod Paul. A neonatologist, Paul headed AIIMS’s paediatrics department for many years. He has been the go-to person for academic, research committees, for jobs that require not just medical acumen but an understanding also of broader fields of public health and health policy.

Paul was one of the three doctors shortlisted for the post of AIIMS director earlier this year. He leads the WHO Collaborating Centre on Newborn Health for South East Asia Region and the Centre for Advanced Research in Newborn Health (Indian Council of Medical Research).

Paul is a visiting professor at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI). He holds positions in multiple international fora on child health, has been a co-chair of the Board of the Global Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health and a member of the UN Millennium Project Task Force on Child Health and Maternal Health. He is also a member of the Steering Committee of global Every Newborn Action Plan.

Unlike his former colleague and PHFI President Dr K S Reddy, Paul has managed to stay on the right side of the government. He is working closely with the government in the field of child health as chair of the Technical Advisory Group and co-chair of the Newborn Health Action group of the health ministry. Paul has developed India’s maternal and child health strategy. He is also a member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, the highest decision making body in the country for decisions on the basket of vaccines for the universal immunisation programme. That engagement is now set to become more broad-based.

Paul’s appointment is a likely signal that the government has preferred to go back to the basics when it comes to health. The government’s key initiative is Mission Indradhanush that seeks to widen and deepen vaccination coverage. As the Aayog plays a key role in deciding contours of government policy, Paul’s appointment will bring some much-needed heft to health planning and possibly push the government to commit more resources for the purpose.

"MLS gaining respectability, soccer league ‘on a good path’","Average MLS attendance has increased by more than 5,000 fans since 2008. (Source: File) Average MLS attendance has increased by more than 5,000 fans since 2008. (Source: File)

There was a time when Major League Soccer depended on a shortlist of marquee names to generate excitement about a match.

A David Beckham, Frank Lampard or Steven Gerrard.

Times are changing. Since its inaugural season in 1996, the league has gained respect around the world and MLS continues to expand its footprint on the global soccer stage. Sure, the English Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and French Ligue 1 still have the talent, market dominance and history to be considered by many the best in the world, but MLS is trending upward.

“It’s brilliant seeing the growth of this league,” said Colorado Rapids goalie Tim Howard, who left the then-New York MetroStars in 2003 and played 13 years in the EPL before returning to MLS last year. “When I left, Don Garber was the commissioner and he had promised new teams, new stadiums, expansion, growth, better players, bigger fan bases, and he’s delivered.”

The league started with 10 clubs in 1996, but now consists of 22 and its goal is to have 28. Atlanta United and Minnesota United are in their first seasons, Los Angeles FC is set to join in 2018 and a Beckham-owned Miami franchise is nearing a deal and could start play in 2020.

Twelve locations are competing for four expansion bids, two of which are expected to be announced later this year.

The value of clubs also is soaring. The average MLS club was valued at $185 million in 2016 by Forbes , a 400 percent increase since 2008. MLS is in year three of its eight-year deals with ESPN, FOX Sports and Univision Deportes. World-class facilities are being built, the talent on the field is better and the world is taking notice.

First-year San Jose president Tom Fox said ownership groups “have built slowly, brick by brick.”

“They didn’t step up to the plate and try to hit home runs.” Fox said. “They’ve been trying to hit a series of singles to move the runners around the bags, and I think they’ve done an excellent job of that in a market that’s much more competitive.”

When it comes to attendance, MLS is in the same conversation as some of the top leagues.

Average MLS attendance has increased by more than 5,000 fans since 2008. The league’s average home attendance this season is currently 21,552, which is only behind the 2016-17 season average in the Bundesliga (41,511), English Premier League (35,822), La Liga (27,700), Mexico’s Liga MX (25,050), China’s Super League (23,780) and Italy’s Serie A (22,164), according to worldfootball.net . It’s ahead of France’s Ligue 1 (21,029), Japan’s J1 League (19,107) and Brazil’s Série A (16,286).

In a market where American football is king, stadiums can be the key to the sport’s growth and to receiving an expansion bid.

United Soccer League’s Sacramento Republic FC is vying for an expansion bid. Officials from the team broke ground on a $245 million privately financed stadium in Sacramento last week. Atlanta United’s new home is the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, a multipurpose facility the team will share with the Atlanta Falcons (both franchises are owned by Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank). Minnesota United’s Allianz Field, a soccer-specific stadium, will open in 2018.

Despite MLS’ growth, the league still has much work to do on the international stage.

It is losing the TV battle on its home pitch. Mexico’s top league, Liga MX, dominates ratings in the U.S.

Last year’s final game netted 3.3 million viewers in the U.S., and more than 6 million viewers overall on Univision and Univision Deportes, according to worldsoccertalk.com . The MLS Cup Final, meanwhile, had the highest title-game viewership in league history with just more than 2 million people in the U.S. and 3.5 million people worldwide.

But MLS clubs are not shying away from the challenge of closing the gap with their North American counterparts.

Atlanta United President Darren Eales believes American clubs winning the CONCACAF Champions League would be a good start. The league pits top North and Central American clubs against one another, and a U.S. club has never won the title.

Still, there’s no question the league is in a better place than it was when a 31-year-old Beckham signed with the LA Galaxy from Real Madrid. Teams no longer necessarily look for quick fixes that a big name can provide. They are signing young designated players and focusing on development academies, which have produced young stars like Seattle’s Jordan Morris, FC Dallas’ Kellyn Acosta and the LA Galaxy’s Gyasi Zardes.

Eales didn’t reach for a star when he assembled Atlanta’s roster, having been on the other end of players joining MLS teams from Europe (he previously held front office positions with English Tottenham Hotspur and West Bromwich Albion).

Atlanta’s core players include Josef Martinez, Miguel Almiron and Tito Villalba, all under 25 years old.

There’s also a flip side: With club values on the rise, Eales said MLS is building a foundation that enables franchises to be more competitive when acquiring talent.

“Now the league can attract more talented players, therefore the quality improves,” Eales said. “It’s a virtuous circle.”

But success takes time and a willingness to be patient, Atlanta United manager Tata Martino said through a translator.

“It’s not something that can happen in one day, or one year,” the former Barcelona manager pointed out. “It’s still a young league and there’s a lot of ground to make up, but I think it’s on a good path.”

Fox, the Earthquakes president who was previously CEO of English Aston Villa, said MLS is starting to play at a level hardcore soccer fans are accustomed to watching.

“They know what good football looks like and actually, the teams Atlanta, I’d say us, others, many other teams have been starting to focus more on creating a much more enjoyable, cohesive product,” Fox said. That is all playing out, but I think it’s a natural evolution for how the league has gone.”

R Ashwin leaves Sri Lanka ashen-faced,"R Ashwin picked up two wickets on day two against Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters) R Ashwin picked up two wickets on day two against Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters)

Half of the Indian fielders formed a well-defined crescent around Kusal Mendis, staring at him and joking around in an alien tongue. There were sweaty palms, fidgety bodies and puzzled eyes. On the ground, there was a sudden rush of excitement. The mood was in stark contrast to the stupor until the innings break — when India eventually declared at 622, their sixth 600-plus total since December last year. The Indian batsmen still accumulated the runs at a brisk pace, but there was a dearth of incidents and drama, or any imminence of those.

The odd ball slithered sharply, Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami struck a few lusty blows, but at no juncture did the match resemble even a semi-thrilling contest. India were cold; Sri Lanka seemed frozen. The entire stadium lurched into a post-lunch siesta. It took off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who shared the new ball with Mohammed Shami, just three balls to wake them up, with a rip-roaring delivery. It drifted into an unsuspecting Upul Tharanga, who followed the drift, before the ball broke away, taking with it a piece of the surface. Tharaga’s eyes goggled, as if he had spotted an apparition. This was the most clinching proof that the strip has assumed devilish proportions. The new ball guaranteed that there was sufficient bounce too. From there on, the match turned suspenseful, like an edgy horror flick.

Soon, Tharanga began to suspect everything that floated over his eye-line. The follow-up was almost anti-climactic, a straighter delivery that snorted into his pads. Tharanga, bleeding nerves, defended awkwardly on the back foot. Cue another similar delivery, a few centimetres outside the off-stump coming into him. Ashwin was softening him up for the kill, astutely making his moves like a veteran Grandmaster. The slow, looping off break was coming.

But Ashwin didn’t get the wicket the way he had planned as Tharanga’s airy flick stuck into KL Rahul’s torso at short-leg. Buoyed by a wicket in his very first over, Ashwin pulled out his vaunted tricks one by one-the carrom ball, the slider, the kinking off-breaks, allying it with flight, loop and dip. Dimuth Karunaratne, whose only consolation of the day being Cheteshwar Pujara’s wicket, turned into a nervous wreck, crease-tied and mind-numbed. Playing on a loop at the back of his mind was the two sliders that nixed him in Galle.

Karunaratne freezes

So, tetchy and tenuous, he played every delivery of Ashwin with a fear that it would be his last. Ashwin made his life hellish-one spun viciously to brush the shoulder of his bat, another lulled him into the drive before evading the outside edge by the slimmest of margins. Ashwin was modulating his pace and angle delightfully and toying with the batsmen’s mind. Karunaratne was riding plain luck. But he couldn’t keep riding his luck forever. One eventually managed to kiss his outside edge to the slips-man Ajinkya Rahane. Karunaratne could have sighed in relief, for the ordeal was finally over.

But, if anything, the ordeal has just begun, for the pitch is throwing tantrums at a fiendish frequency. It’s not like the Pune snake-pit during the India-

Australia series, nor could it unravel as hastily as that, but there’s a lurking tackiness about the wicket that makes batting a harrowing experience. Karunaratne later reflected the recipe is to bat positively. He, though, would vouch it’s harder to actualise than speak.

The first sign of the pitch shedding its friendliness came in the lead-up to lunch, when the hitherto toothless Malinda Pushpakumara made one turn sharply away from a spot (not a rough) just outside Ajinkya Rahane’s off-stump. It reaped immediate rewards too, as Rahane flitted down the track a couple of balls later and was beaten in the flight to be stumped.

Such incidents, though, came few and far between when Sri Lanka bowled. The regularity only increased as the match progressed and the surface deteriorated. So rather than be encouraged by the tantrums, every such delivery sprinkled grains of suspicion amidst them, for India had already stacked up more than 400 runs. The very thought of the trial that awaited them at the hands of Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja would have made their limbs quiver.

Karunaratne felt the the pitch will be de-venomed once the new ball loses its hardness, and as the strip becomes slower. But Jadeja and Ashwin are supremely-endowed bowlers who can exploit even the minutest whiff of assistance available.

Jadeja, even more so, as there are a couple of spots outside the right-hander’s good-length area, from where the ball had kicked and jumped disconcertingly into them. And there are few other spinner around the world who could relentlessly probe those spots as Jadeja.

It was Jadeja-like accuracy that the Sri Lankan bowlers, even their metronomic Rangana Herath, couldn’t produce. They were indisciplined and impatient in equal measure. Off-spinner Dilruwan Perera embodied the malaise.

True that they can blame a placid first-day pitch and their lone pacer Nuwan Pradeep’s injury for the ditch they find themselves in, but in the end they were left wanting for discipline and patience. It’s the turn of their batsmen to atone for them.

Fitness is not just a habit, it is a lifestyle; one that requires commitment and dedication so dont let monsoon dampen your spirits. Some quick and easy steps like working out indoors or getting few simpler exercising devices can do the trick for you, say experts.

Reebok Master Trainer Gagan Arora encourages you to keep your body engine fueled every day, with these simple things to keep in mind during rainy days.

* Run those miles: The body is waterproof so do not fret to take those extra laps in the rain. An outdoor workout keeps the body metabolism going and helps you stay fit and energized.

* Stay active through the day: If heading out in the rain is not your cup of tea, workout indoors. Pack in a short 30 – 40 minutes schedule that includes a mix of squats, push-ups, planks. Apart from homemade food, add seasonal fruits and vegetables along with lean meat and legumes to your diet.

* The ‘Right’ Gear: Wear bright coloured speed wick or Active Chill fitness gear and socks as they will keep you cool during humidity, dry quickly and reduce the chances of chaffing.

* Monsoon gateways: Take a break from your routine and unwind with a quick getaway during the rains. Plan a fun ‘Fitcation’ that includes long walks and fun outdoor games with family and friends to stay active, energized and light this monsoon.

* Vitamins are vital – Add vitamins to your diet to keep infections at bay and maintain your energy levels. Get enough rest, stay indoors and relax if not feeling well.

Additionally, Meenakshi Subramaniyam, coach at HealthifyMe.com also added few tips.

* Stick to the same time plan for workout sessions at home. Make sure the session is 45 minutes at least.

* Start with simple stretching exercises to warm-up followed by five minutes spot jogging. Follow it up with 15 minutes of rigorous cardio to get the heart beat up and start the fat burning process. One can opt for skipping, stair climbing, hopping, jumping jacks etc. To strengthen body muscles for toning the body and preventing joints from injury, do a combination of 20 squats + 20 lunges (each leg) + 20 pushups. You repeat this set 2-4 times as per your capacity.

* Get few simple exercising devices like dumbells, skipping rope, resistance tubes etc at home and try hardcore floor exercises like planks, crunches and leg raises. You can start with a plank position for 30 seconds and repeat it again. Then lie down on your back and do 20 crunches + 20 reverse crunches + 20 alternate leg raises. Repeat this set 2 times. An indoor jog on the spot or around a house jog is also beneficial, or Leslie walks which can be done indoors.

* Yoga can be performed both indoors and outdoors. Select an airy spot in your house practice simple asanas to keep yourself fit. Yoga also helps reduce respiratory problems that are very common during the monsoon season.

*Dance workouts are fun and flexible to enjoy indoor monsoon workout.

"In Kerala, a father asks ‘What did they get by killing my son?’","ON SATURDAY, while CPI(M), BJP and RSS leaders held zone-level peace talks in Kannur in north Kerala, 500 km to the south, at Edavakkodu area of the state capital, K Sudarshan maintained that his grandchildren — aged six and four — are orphans today only because of this cycle of political violence in the state.

Saturday marked a week since his son, K Rajesh, 34, was attacked at Sreekariyam, Thiruvananthapuram — he died within hours — and a day before Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s scheduled visit to the family’s small home at Edavakkodu.

The BJP and RSS accuses CPI(M) workers of killing Rajesh, a claim the latter denies. The police have not called it a political murder yet. They suspect it was personal rivalry between Rajesh and the main accused, Manikkuttan, that led to the attack. Sudarshan, however, seemed certain why his son was attacked: “The only crime he had committed was he worked for the BJP. After several youths in the area joined BJP, Rajesh had faced threat from the CPI(M).”

On Friday, he said, when he was leaving home to collect his son’s ashes, Rajesh’s elder son Adithyan, 6, asked him, “Are you going to bring father home?” Neither of his grandchildren — the younger one, Abhilash, is 4 — know their father is dead. “What did they get by killing my son? How will we live now? We all depended on his (Rajesh’s) meagre income,” he said.

Rajesh, who had begun attending an RSS shakha from age nine, was a construction worker. A police source today said Manikkuttan, arrested along with several others soon after the attack on Rajesh, was involved in several criminal cases. He had undergone a jail term in 2013. He lives in Panachamkunnu colony of Thiruvananthapuram and knew Rajesh and his family, the source said. Manikkuttan and three of the 11 others accused —Ebi, Vijith and Biju — were allegedly associated with CPI(M).

But CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishan said, “It was personal rivalry. There had been cases of assault involving both (Manikkuttan and Rajesh). The BJP is depicting this as a political murder to show that law and order situation in Kerala has collapsed.”

BJP leaders point out that once a red bastion, the saffron party is gaining ground at Edavakkod in recent years. In the last Assembly election, BJP polled more votes than CPI(M) from Edavakkad. Rajesh, they claim, was killed since he was an active and influential RSS worker.

Lower-order steps up as India pile on 622/9 against Sri Lanka,"R Ashwin picked up two wickets on day two against Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters) R Ashwin picked up two wickets on day two against Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters)

R Ashwin got off the mark with an drive which was not in control but he still got a four. He looked in more control as his innings progressed and he punished the Sri Lanka bowlers. He also had a good look of the pitch during his 54-run innings. As puff of dust began coming off it, Ashwin would have enjoyed it rather than being anxious about them.

A strong lower-order batting performance, including that of Ashwin, from India saw them post their seventh 600-plus total in last 12 months and second in two Tests as Virat Kohli left Sri Lanka 20 overs to survive on after declaring India’s first innings on 622 for 9 on day two of the second Test in Colombo.

And it proved too much for Sri Lanka as they lost two wickets for 50 runs and still needed 372 runs to avoid the follow-on. Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal were the two unbeaten batsmen for Sri Lanka.

Ashwin removed both Sri Lanka openers in his spell of 10 overs after opening the bowling. Upul Tharanga was caught at short-leg after he played one straight to KL Rahul off a short ball which could have been put away anywhere. Rahul hung on to the catch which hit him right in the abdomen.

Dimuth Karunaratne got a beautiful delivery on the off-side for which he leaned forward only to get an outside edge and get caught at slips. He made half of Sri Lanka’s score on Friday and moved his feet nicely.

This was after Indian batsmen had done that all day and piled runs with ease. Not only the overnight batsmen Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, but lower order batsmen also used the same technique to disturb Sri Lanka bowlers’ line and length.

India lost their first centurion Pujara for 133 early in the day Sri Lanka’s bowling change worked. The only pacer in the lineup Nuwan Pradeep did not take the field. So, Sri Lanka bowled with Karunaratne and he got one to move back into Pujara who was struck on the pads. Umpire said no to the appeal.

The hosts reviewed after wicket-keeper Niroshan Dickwella insisted. Hitting Pujara on the back leg, the ball was crashing into the leg stump and Pujara had to walk back.

India stuck with Ashwin at number five and he joined Rahane in the middle. As soon as Rahane looked to unleash, he was undone as Malinda Pushpakumara picked up his maiden Test wicket. He would be proved of the way he got it. Pushpakumara gave the delivery some flight and Rahane, already down the pitch, could not counter the dip and missed the delivery. Niroshan Dickwella did not take much time to remove the bails.

India went into Lunch at 442 for 5 and when Ashwin and Saha resumed, it did not take them time to reaslise that the pitch was not assisting the spinners. Saha used his feet to a great extent which Ashwin was rocked solid in the crease.

He completed his half-century and 2000 Test runs, becoming the fastest to reach the milestone with 250 wickets. But, he was out the next delivery as Rangana Herath bowled a quicker one which Ashwin, trying to cut, missed and was bowled.

But India’s strong lower-order with Ravindra Jadeja coming at number nine continued to torment the bowlers. Jadeja scored one of India’s six half-centuries, a feat achieved only second time in away Tests, as India scored 100 or more runs in a session for the fifth time in this series. Only the first session is where India missed the mark but they managed 98 in that.

Hardik Pandya played a cameo of run-a-ball 20 but was caught at long-off playing a big shot. This was after Saha had come down the pitch to a ball that drifted, dipped and then bounced to beat him. He was stumped after his half-century.

A few lusty blows by Mohammed Shami took the total close to 600 before Jadeja took the team there. After 600 in the Galle Test, India once again took their total past that mark. No team has achieved scored 600-plus totals more than India in Tests in the past one year. India have lost none of the Test as well.

UN chief Antonio Guterres asks United States to re-engage in 2015 Paris climate agreement,"The spokesperson added that the secretary-general “welcomes any effort to reengage in the Paris Agreement by the United States”.

The UN chief today urged the US to re-engage with the 2015 Paris climate agreement even after America submitted its formal communication indicating its intention to withdraw from the historic pact as soon as possible. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has received a notification from the US expressing the country’s intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, his spokesman said.

The notification received yesterday was communicated by US Permanent Representative to the UN Nikki Haley. “The Secretary-General received, in his capacity as Depositary of the Paris Agreement, a communication from the Permanent Representative of the US expressing the intention of the US to exercise its right to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, as soon as it is eligible to do so under the Agreement, unless it identifies suitable terms for reengagement,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.

The Paris climate deal aims to prevent the Earth from heating up by 2C since the start of the industrial age. The spokesperson added that the secretary-general “welcomes any effort to reengage in the Paris Agreement by the United States”. The notification came two months after President Donald Trump announced his intention to leave the accord.

Under article 28 of the Paris Agreement, a party may withdraw at any time after three years from the date on which the agreement has entered into force for that party, and such withdrawal takes effect upon expiry of one year from the date of receipt by the depositary of the notification of withdrawal.

The US accepted the Paris Agreement on September 3, 2016 and the agreement entered into force for the US on November 4, 2016. This means that the US must stay in the pact until at least 2019.

The note referred to the June statement by the secretary-general in which he had said that the decision by the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement is a “major disappointment” for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security.

“It is crucial that the United States remains a leader on climate and sustainable development. Climate change is impacting now,” Dujarric said, adding that the UN Chief looks forward to engaging with the American government and all other actors in the United States and around the world to build the sustainable future for our children and future generations.

The Empire Gazes Back,"Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about. Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about.

In 1978, the Lebanese American scholar Edward Said published a seminal treatment of how the Western world and its scholarship viewed the Islamic world of the Middle East. His central argument was: knowledge is embedded in equations of power and all Western scholarship on nonwestern societies is tainted by its association with imperialism. Power therefore defined knowledge. The reception of ‘Orientalism’ is not surprising. The 1970s was an era when the west seemed to be rolling back. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan followed in 1979. The Shia revolution in Iran in the same year was as much an ideological and intellectual revolution against the West and the USA as a political revolution against the Shah. The spread of extremism and Islamic fundamentalism elsewhere challenged then, as it does now, deeply engrained notions of what constituted progress in Western eyes. Said’s book Orientalism became a classic, as it remains to this day.

Academic critiques of Said were no less powerful. Substantial parts of the book delved into periods when the Islamic world was not subordinated to the West. So, perceptions of Islam as degenerate and backward did not develop as a consequence of Western conquest but, in fact, had predated it. Said’s argument about power and knowledge was much criticised on this ground. But even at that time, there was the view that the perfect match to study the relationship between imperial power and knowledge was to be found not so much in the middle east but in colonial India.

Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about. Arvind Sharma is a professor of comparative religion in Montreal. This is, in part, an assimilative work drawing on a wide range of studies in the past quarter-century, which have asked questions like those he raises: How did colonial scholarship evolve, and how did the process of studying colonial subjects and themes also transform the colonies in greater or lesser measure? This is a book refreshingly free of jargon — it’s a good point for the serious but general reader to start with to understand how much colonialism and imperialism permeated scholarship, and how very clearly the relationship between knowledge and power was understood by both sets of practitioners.

Sharma describes, as others have before him, how scholarship about India and Indians changed as the East India Company transformed itself from a trading enterprise to a political and then a colonial power. The initial fascination, even admiration, for India and things Indians, acquired through the 19th century gave way, especially after 1857, to deep biases arising from a sense of contempt. He also does well to remind us how intrinsic missionary activity was to the entire imperial project as critiques of Hinduism went hand in hand with efforts at conversion. Racism also permeated colonial scholarship to a greater extent than is generally conceded. I found one particular instance cited by Sharma striking. Annette Beveridge, wife of a British civil servant and scholar, was an accomplished Persian scholar in her own right. Her translation of Gulbadan Begum’s Humayun Namah in the late 19th century is a work of great sensitivity and charm, as a woman of the time sought to understand and contextualise the account of a Mughal princess in the 17th century. But Beveridge was also at the forefront of the agitation in India insisting that Indian judges not be allowed to try English or white people. Beveridge then wrote about the social ideas of Hindus as being “on the outer verge of civilisation” and that she had no hesitation in calling them “uncivilised a people which cares about stone idols, enjoys child marriage and secludes its women, and where at every point the fact of sex is present to the mind.” In brief, how could such people be allowed to try English men and women!

Nevertheless, this is not a book about the inequities of British rule in India (although there is some of that) but rather about how British scholarship was an exercise underwritten by power and at the same time directed at cementing a relationship of subjugation. Illustrating how such scholarship also transformed social realities in India is one of Sharma’s endeavors, as he takes us through themes of caste, race, religion, science, historical sense or lack of it, etc. If parts of this treatment would be familiar to scholars, there is also sufficient that is new and surprising enough to engage the general reader.

Sharma’s central thesis of power underwriting scholarship in colonial India is unexceptional. Nevertheless, his extension of Said’s Orientalism debate to India also raises other questions. Did Orientalism cease in 1947 with the end of political subjugation? Or does this approach continue, since in many ways the relationship between India and the West continues to have elements that are unequal. More problematic are the questions thrown up by Sharma’s suggestions that political domination is the key variable in determining perceptions. This explanation, however appealing, may also have limitations. What was characteristic about British scholarship of India in the colonial period was not just that the British ruled India. It was also the fact that the rulers came from a society and an age that had, since the Enlightenment, radically transformed ideas of knowledge and how it was to be collected, organised and disseminated. This gave to knowledge production in colonial India features not encountered in earlier and other situations of political domination.

The Ruler’s Gaze is a thought provoking and imaginative work that furthers the debate about how profoundly British colonialism affected India and Indians.

NCLT order in Jaypee Infra case on August 9,"Allahabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) will pronounce an order in the insolvency petition against Jaypee Infratech on August 9. IDBI Bank had referred the company to the bankruptcy court in June following a nudge from the RBI.

The company said in a regulatory filing on Friday that it has withdrawn its reply to the petition. “In the larger interest of all stakeholders, including the home owners and depositors, the company has withdrawn its reply. After hearing both sides, NCLT has reserved its order to be pronounced on August 9, 2017,” Jaypee Infratech said.

The company reported a net loss of Rs 876 crore on Rs 962 crore in revenues in 2016-17 and its gross debt stood at Rs 7,922 crore. The company is part of the 12 large defaulters identified by the RBI based on a criterion of at least Rs 5,000 crore worth of debt exposure, 60 per cent of which being classified as non-performing. The RBI had on June 13 asked banks to refer a dozen troubled companies with a combined debt of close to Rs 2.4 lakh crore to the NCLT, following several failed attempts at loan recovery.

Once cases are with the NCLT, the lenders need to set up a committee of creditors that will come up with a plan on how the asset will be tackled. If the committee is unable to find a solution within 180 days — this can be extended to 270 days — the borrowing entity will go into liquidation.

Why 6 secys not named accused: P Chidambaram,"Congress leader P Chidambaram (Express Photo Pavan Khengre) Congress leader P Chidambaram (Express Photo Pavan Khengre)

Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram on Saturday asked the government why six secretaries of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) were not named by the CBI if the 2007 clearance given to a media house for receiving foreign investment was wrong.

The CBI and the Enforcement Directorate had filed cases against his son Karti Chidambaram and INX Media in connection with alleged irregularities in the grant of FIPB approval to the company to get foreign direct investment.

Chidambaram had earlier defended his son saying he had never met any officer associated with the FIPB and had no connection with INX Media.

“If FIPB approval in a particular case was wrong, why does CBI not name the six secretaries as accused? Is it because the six secretaries were persons of unimpeachable integrity?” Chidambaram tweeted.

Open conflict triggers concern Poland might leave EU next,"President of the European Council Donald Tusk leaves the prosecutor’s office in Warsaw, Poland, Thursday, Aug. 3, 2017. (AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski) President of the European Council Donald Tusk leaves the prosecutor’s office in Warsaw, Poland, Thursday, Aug. 3, 2017. (AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski)

Since British voters endorsed leaving the European Union, politicians and pundits have ruminated on which of the bloc’s remaining 27 nations could be next. “Grexit” and “Frexit,” for Greece and France, were two subjects of speculation. Now, months of open conflict between Poland’s conservative nationalist government and the rest of the EU has some Poles wondering if their leaders are putting the country on a path that could take it out of the union.

“There is a question mark over Poland’s European future today,” European Council President Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who is a critic of the ruling Law and Justice party, said Thursday. The EU is widely popular in Poland, so the idea of the country abandoning the bloc strikes many people here as farfetched. Several surveys have shown public support for the EU standing at over 70 percent, approval stemming from the economic boom and freedom of travel that came with membership in 2004.

But members of the opposition in Poland increasingly are voicing fears that the conflicts between Warsaw and Brussels could eventually lead to a parting of ways.

They point to the defiant stance Law and Justice and its leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, adopted when the EU raised concerns about changes to Poland’s justice system and the extensive logging the government has ordered in a primeval forest that has been classified as a UNESCO world heritage site. Government spokesman Rafal Bochenek insisted that Polish leaders intend to keep Poland in the bloc.

“Poland is a member of EU and is going to be a leading partner to other member states within the structure,” Bochenek told The Associated Press on Friday. “We have got many ambitious projects and challenges to realize in the EU. We will cooperate with our European partners.”

Law and Justice has never publicly advocated leaving the bloc, but criticizes what it views as unnecessary EU bureaucracy and infringements on the authority of member countries to make their own decisions. In that vein, Poland’s government aggressively pushed through legislation to put the court system under the ruling party’s control. The EU’s executive arm has said the moves violate democratic norms by reducing judicial independence.

With Warsaw refusing to give in to the bloc’s calls for it to respect the separation of powers, the European Commission is threatening steps that could lead to Poland losing its EU voting rights.

The government also has continued logging in the Bialowieza Forest even though the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ordered it last week to stop felling trees immediately. If it continues, Poland could be hit with massive fines.

Katarzyna Lubnauer, a lawmaker with the opposition Modern party, said recently that because Poles are such “Euro-enthusiasts,” nobody in the ruling Law and Justice party would admit that leaving the bloc is their aim.

“But when we look at what is happening now, we have a deep sense that this departure is taking place,” Lubnauer said. “But it will happen in stages.”

Tusk made a similar argument Thursday, saying he viewed the “arrogant” refusal to obey the EU court’s logging decision as an “attempt to put Poland in conflict with the European Union.”

“It seems to me like a prelude to an announcement that Poland does not need the European Union and that Poland is not needed for the EU,” he said. “I think such a moment would be one of the most dangerous in our history. I am afraid we are closer than further to that moment.”

Bochenek, the government spokesman, called Tusk’s statement one of the many “lies” the former prime minister has told about Poland. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker sees the formal steps taken over Poland’s judiciary as a way to maintain dialogue with Warsaw and resolve the problems, spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said.

“We are working to keep this union together,” Andreeva said.

"Manish, Sajan in bronze medal round in Junior World Wrestling","Manish won three bouts on the trot to storm into the semifinals of Greco-Roman 60kg. (Source: File) Manish won three bouts on the trot to storm into the semifinals of Greco-Roman 60kg. (Source: File)

Two Indian Greco-Roman wrestlers, Manish and Sajan put up contrasting performances to enter the bronze-medal round of their respective weight categories in the Junior World Wrestling championships in Tampere, Finland.

While Manish (60kg) came up with a dominating show to advance to the bronze-medal round, Sajan (74kg) made the cut only after his 1/8 stage opponent from Kyrgyzstan reached the finals.

Manish won three bouts on the trot to storm into the semifinals of Greco-Roman 60kg.

Manish displayed consistent performance to defeat Gabin Kim of Korea, Seydylla Tazayev of Turkmenistan and Hungary’s Krisztian Istvan Vancza on his way to the last four stage.

However, he failed to maintain the momentum and went down to Keramat Morad Abdevali of Iran 1-3 in his semifinal bout.

Manish will now fight for a bronze medal with Hassan Ahmed Mohamed of Egypt in a third-fourth place match, scheduled later tonight.

Sajan, on the other hand, did not have an ideal start to his campaign as he lost his very first bout against Akzhol Makhmudov 2-10. But when the Kyrgyzstani grappler reached the gold medal round, Sajan got a chance to fight in repechage.

He had to fight two repechage rounds and the Indian beat both his rivals rather comfortably.

Sajan first got the better of Per Anders Kure of Norway 11-2 before outplaying Iran’s Mohammad Pareviz Neiazi 14-4 to make the bronze-medal round.

He will take on Ali Osman Erbay of Turkey. However, it was curtains for the other two Indians Sagar (96kg) and Arjun Halakurki (50kg).

While Arjun lost in his opening round to exit the competition, Sagar managed to make the repechage round but failed to capitalise on the chance. He lost to Amirmohammad Hosseinreza Noroozipasand of Iran 4-6 in his repechage bout.

In September Akanksha Choudhary will represent India in Miss Face of Beauty International beauty pageant.

Excelling in the career while keeping a firm touch with our talents and hobbies is the dream of every student. We all wish to make it big but few manage to balance out time efficiently. One such inspiring case is that of Akanksha Choudhary, a 20-year-old model and winner of Miss India Elite 2016 who has recently joined the PGP programme at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad.

Choudhary participated in extra curricular and yet manage to hold the fifth rank among students of the batch at SRCC. While her focus is a degree in MBA, she has become a model by fluke.

After auditioning at a management institute, she was selected to contest in Miss India Elite, which she won last year. “I took part in the event just out of interest. I did not expect to win, let alone work as a model after that. Being a model has groomed me to maintain a fit and healthy lifestyle and understand that the beauty lies in the values we inculcate in our lives. The rigorous routine of maintaining a healthy body and taking part in modelling events has even pushed me to manage my time wisely,” she said.

She participated in many events like India Showcase Week and Blenders Pride which involved a lot of travelling and working with celebrities including Salman Khan and Malaika Arora. To maintain a balance between her college and professional life, she minimised her sleep and studied while on the move.

With a prestigious college name like SRCC in her kitty, Choudhary didn’t turn complacent. She, in fact, worked hard to crack CAT 2016. “I aimed to study at IIM-A since I was in school. After bagging a seat at SRCC, I wasted no time and made sure to solve and practice questions on quantitative subjects.

They say no knowledge gets wasted. For Chaudhary, learning new things didn’t burden her but made her skills sharper. While many flunk at the interview round in the IIMs, she managed to impress the team. “I presented myself confidently. SRCC has helped in building my knowledge base but it was modelling where I learnt presentation skills,” said she.

But now after securing a seat in IIM-A, will she get time for her hobbies? “It’s all about time management. To be a model I need to be fit and healthy. So I exercise for one hour every day, follow a strict diet and take part in various events during the weekend. I spend my weekdays fully focused on studies and attending classes” said she.

In September, Chaudhary will represent India in Miss Face of Beauty International beauty pageant to be held in Delhi. She still prefers a management career over modelling. “I will never quit modelling because it keeps me fit but I also want to complete my educational goals. My dream is to become a niche consultant. So I want to learn how the entire corporate world works and climb the corporate ladder,” said she.

"In Pune, tempo held, mob attacks gau rakshaks in Ahmednagar","Case of attempt to murder, police say 7 injured. (Source: Express Photo) Case of attempt to murder, police say 7 injured. (Source: Express Photo)

A mob of around 50 persons allegedly attacked gau rakshaks near Shrigonda police station in Ahmednagar district on Saturday evening, soon after they, along with police, had intercepted a tempo reportedly illegally transporting cows to a slaughterhouse. The Ahmednagar police said seven gau rakshaks were injured in the attack. A case of attempt to murder has been registered at the Shrigonda police station.

The owner of the tempo, Wahid Shaikh, and driver Raju Fatrubhai Shaikh have been arrested under the Maharashtra Animal Preservation Act. Shivshankar Rajendra Swami of Pune, who claims to be a legally appointed ‘honorary animal welfare officer’, said he and a team of 11 gau rakshaks had come to the Shrigonda taluka in the morning to “watch” out for illegal transportation of cows to the famous weekly animal market in Kashti village, held every Saturday.

Swami, 24, is a complainant in about 300 cases of alleged illegal cow transportation and slaughtering in Pune and other districts of Maharashtra, and has been assigned 12-hour police protection when within Pune city limits, due to a reported threat to his life. He is a member of the Akhil Bharat Krushi Goseva Sangh founded by Mahatma Gandhi and ‘Gorakhsa Pramukh’ of the Samasta Hindu Aghadi.

Samasta Hindu Aghadi chief Milind Ekbote contested the Assembly elections in 2014 on a Shiv Sena ticket but lost to the BJP. Before that, between 1992 and 1997, Ekbote was a BJP corporator in Pune. Like Swami, Ekbote claims to be an ‘honorary animal welfare officer’, authorised to keep a vigil on instances of violation of animal welfare laws in Maharashtra.

“We got information about a tempo transporting cows illegally. We informed the Shrigonda police about it. With the help of police, the tempo was intercepted near Hotel Tiranga on the Daund-Ahmednagar road, around 1 pm. Ten oxen and two cows were rescued. Later, we went to the Shrigonda police station for lodging a police complaint. We were hungry so we went to a hotel to have food, when we saw an armed mob gathering at the spot. So we again went to the police station and completed filing the FIR against Wahid Shaikh and Raju Shaikh,” said Swami, adding that the tempo owner and driver were taking the cows and oxen illegally to a slaughterhouse in Zendi Gate, Hamalwada area of Ahmednagar.

“Around 6 pm, when we left the police station, where some mediapersons had also gathered, a mob of about 50, with some carrying sharp weapons and stones, attacked us, leaving some of our activists injured. The assailants also robbed gold chains of some activists. Police rushed to the spot and controlled the situation,” said Swami.

Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ahmednagar, Sudarshan Munde said, “As per the FIR lodged by Swami, we have booked about 30 persons under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 395 (dacoity) and other sections of the IPC. Seven persons were injured in the incident. Investigation has been initiated to confirm the sequence of events and arrest the assailants.”

"Act against countries using non-state actors, says Afghanistan","U.S. Army soldiers fire a howitzer artillery piece at Seprwan Ghar forward fire base in Panjwai district, Kandahar province southern Afghanistan. (Source: Reuters) U.S. Army soldiers fire a howitzer artillery piece at Seprwan Ghar forward fire base in Panjwai district, Kandahar province southern Afghanistan. (Source: Reuters)

In a veiled attack on Pakistan, Afghanistan on Thursday said it wants the international community to take action against countries using non-state actors to further their foreign policy goals. In the recent weeks, Afghanistan has witnessed some of the worst terrorist attacks killing a number of people. Kabul has blamed Pakistan-based terror groups for these attacks.

“Our mission at the UN is working on presenting its evidence to the Security Council over the use of terrorism in Afghanistan and their linkages,” Afghanistan’s Ambassador to the US Hamdullah Mohib told PTI.

While he did not mention Pakistan in this context, his inference was towards the neighbouring country across the Durand Line.

In June, Afghanistan cut all cricketing ties with Pakistan after a deadly bomb attack which the country’s intelligence agency blamed on militants backed by Islamabad.

The bombing in Kabul had killed at least 90 people.

Afghanistan criticises Pakistan for allowing the Taliban and Haqqani terror network to operate from its soil for planning attacks in Afghanistan.

Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani in December accused Pakistan of launching an “undeclared war” on his country by covertly supporting several terror networks, including the Taliban.

“The UN is already in the picture, and I think there is more and more voices in the international community that are aligning with us, and understand the pain and the miseries of the Afghan people,” the Afghan diplomat said, expressing his pain and anger over the killing of so many innocent citizens.

“The ideal solution be the end to using non-state actors and terrorists to bring havoc upon a people who deserve peace and security, who have suffered far too long. If there isn’t an end to the support, we would like the international community to take some actions in order to discourage and to prevent such states from continued usage of non-state actors,” Mohib said in response to a question.

While he did not elaborate the actions Afghanistan would like to take against such countries, the envoy referred to a series of legislative actions and statements coming from top American lawmakers like sanctions, restrictions on sale of military hardware and revoking the non-NATO ally status.

Last month Senator John McCain, Chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, moved a legislative amendment to impose graduated diplomatic, military and economic costs on Pakistan as long as it continues to provide support and sanctuary to terrorist and insurgent groups, including the Taliban and the Haqqani Network.

Larry Pressler, a former top American Senator, in a latest book has said that it is time to declare Pakistan a State Sponsor of Terrorism.

“There are certain actions that can be taken, but that will be the beginning or the start of holding Pakistan responsible, in this manner. It will then go into next phases and how the reaction… and what needs to be done in step two or three. Actions such as revoking the status as a major non-NATO ally would be the beginning because it makes it harder for them to get military equipment, the military sales and the other element would be as an international standing.

“It makes it harder for them to attract investments which would be a good motivation for Pakistan to move towards taking serious action against terrorism, all terrorists. Not selected terrorists,” the Afghan diplomat added.

Security forces in Myanmar fired warning shots to disperse Muslim villagers while they were arresting four suspected insurgents in a western region where government troops have been accused of human rights violations against Rohingya minority, officials said today.

About 600 villagers surrounded troops in Rathedaung township in Rakhine state yesterday while they were searching for six men suspected of financing a “terrorist” group, said police officer Zaw Win Aung. He said the villagers carried slingshots, sticks and machetes as they approached the troops, who responded by firing 40-50 warning shots. They managed to arrest four suspects, he said.

On Thursday, the government said that six Buddhists were killed and two other villagers are missing in Kaigyi village in Maungdaw township, also in Rakhine state.

It wasn’t clear who was responsible, but Major Zayar of the border guard police headquarters in Maungdaw said they were searching for culprits.

The government has shut down northern Rakhine to independent journalists, rights experts and humanitarian workers for almost nine months except for organized media trips.

The military has launched operations in the northern part of Rakhine since last October, when suspected Rohingya militants killed nine police officers along the border with Bangladesh.

Rights groups said that during the crackdown, more than 1,000 houses have been burned down, an unknown number of civilians killed and hundreds of Rohingya men and boys arrested. The government said that the operation had ended in February.

Last month, the UN human rights envoy to Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, expressed disappointment over a lack of government effort to tackle problems behind the violence between Buddhists and Muslims. She said she saw little improvement in the situation for Rohingya and that the government prevented her from visiting several areas there.

"Dutee Chand, Muhammed Anas with disappointing show at World Championship","Dutee Chand’s performance was a far cry from her showing at the Asain Athletics Championships in Bhubaneshwar in July. (Source: File) Dutee Chand’s performance was a far cry from her showing at the Asain Athletics Championships in Bhubaneshwar in July. (Source: File)

Dutee Chand and Muhammed Anas Yahiya failed to progress to the latter stages of the women’s 100 metres and men’s 400 metres race categories respectively at the World Athletics Championship in London by failing to getting the required timings in the Heats on Saturday. Dutee, wearing bib number 3992, finished sixth in Heat 5 with a time of 12.07 seconds. It placed her 38th overall among 47 athletes. This is worse than her personal best of 11.24 seconds that she had registered at Almaty in June, 2016. Her season best of 11.30 seconds had come in in Delhi.

Dutee’s performance was a far cry from her showing at the Asain Athletics Championships in Bhubaneshwar in July where she took the bronze medal by finishing in 11.52 seconds. The girl from Odisha had come into the event following a quota entry despite failing to come up with the qualification standard. She was included after the required participants list of 56 was not achieved.

“The girl next to me was disqualified due to a false start and I got nervous. I could not come out of the blocks as fast as I would have wanted, so the timing was poor. The temperature was also cold. I had run with better timings in India because at this time the temperature there (in India) is more suited. I need a bit of warm temperature,” she said following the race. London had received rainfall prior to the second day’s action with the temperature dropping to under 20 degrees.

“I should have been told early that I may qualify for this World Championships and I would have done a better preparation. They told me at the last minute that I will get a quota entry. After the Asian Championships in Bhubaneswar, I did not take part in the National Inter-State Championships in Guntur as I was not well. I was not doing proper training,” she added.

In the men’s 400 metres event, Anas finished fourth in the sixth Heats and registered a time of 45.98 seconds which was much lower than the third placed athlete’s 45.27 seconds. For Anas the equation had become clear that he needed to finish in the top three or do better than 45.70 seconds but he couldn’t match his season best of 45.32 seconds to ensure he moves forward.

“I could have been in the top three but lost the chance in the final 300m. I was running good in the first 100m but could not maintain the momentum. Now I will have to do well in the relay (men’s 4x400m),” he said after race. “I am disappointed. Now I hope to do well in the Commonwealth and Asian Games next year,” he added.

Davis Cup singles to remain best-of-five set affairs,"Davis Cup singles to remain best-of-five set affairs. (Source: File) Davis Cup singles to remain best-of-five set affairs. (Source: File)

Davis Cup singles matches will continue to be decided over the best-of-five sets after a proposal to shorten the contests failed to achieve the required mandate, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said on Friday.

The governing body’s board of directors had unanimously backed reforms for both the men’s Davis Cup and women’s Fed Cup, which included a recommendation to play matches in the men’s event as the best of three sets.

However, the change was not approved at the ITF’s annual general meeting in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City as the motion received 63.54 percent support from member nations, falling just short of the two-thirds majority needed to be passed.

“We respect the decision of the AGM but are disappointed that our member nations have not approved the full package of Davis Cup and Fed Cup reforms endorsed by the ITF Board,” ITF president David Haggerty said in a statement.

“Change is needed to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, and we remain committed to working with our national associations and other stakeholders on finding ways to enhance Davis Cup and Fed Cup.”

The AGM, however, approved a motion guaranteeing the finalists in both cup events the choice of hosting their first-round ties the following year.

Match court availability and practice court requirements will also be lower to reduce hosting costs for national associations, the AGM approved.

The members also passed a motion to reduce Davis Cup pre-tie commitments for players to a single function combining the draw, post-draw press conferences and interviews, and an official lunch.

Iraq secures $195 million Japanese loan for electricity sector,"Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi attends a news conference in Kirkuk, Iraq. (Source: Reuters) Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi attends a news conference in Kirkuk, Iraq. (Source: Reuters)

Japan has agreed to lend Iraq up to $195 million for a project to help repair a thermal power station in the southern province of Basra, an Iraqi government statement said on Saturday.

Though Iraq is a major OPEC oil producer, the country faces chronic electricity shortages, with its fragile grid struggling to meet demand after years of war, sanctions and neglect.

The loan was signed during a visit to Iraq by Japan’s State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kentaro Sonoura, who met Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Saturday, the prime minister office said in a statement.

Iraq needs external financing to plug a budget deficit of approximately 25 trillion Iraqi dinars ($21.44 billion) for this year as it grapples with lower global oil prices and costs associated with the fight against Islamic State.

Harvard Law alumni directory lists fired White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci as dead,"Anthony Scaramucci was fired for his expletive-laced tirade against his White House colleagues.

Anthony Scaramucci is having a bad week. He was fired as President Donald Trump’s communications director – and listed as dead in Harvard Law School’s alumni directory. The directory mailed to alumni this week had an asterisk next to Scaramucci’s name, indicating he had died, the Washington Post and CBS News reported on Monday. The 53-year-old New York financier is a 1989 graduate of the Ivy League law school.

On Tuesday, Scaramucci was fired after just 10 days in the job, reflecting the chaos in the Donald Trump administration. Scaramucci, 53, who was appointed as the White House Director of Communications only 10 days ago and was reporting directly to the president.

In an interview last week, the former Wall Street financier used expletives to describe his White House colleagues and threatened to fire everyone from the White House who leaked information.

“The President certainly felt that Anthony’s comments were inappropriate for a person in that position,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders had said.

Scaramucci was fired hours after John Kelly, 67, a retired marine general, took over as the new White House chief of staff, replacing Reince Priebus.

In the last 10 days, Trump has fired three of his top officials. It first began with his Press Secretary Sean Spicer, followed by Priebus and now Scaramucci, who probably had the shortest stint as the White House Director of Communications.

In a post to Twitter, Trump insisted that there had been “No WH chaos!”

Sanders said Trump has given full authority to Kelly, and he’ll make determinations inside the White House. “General Kelly I think will bring new structure to the White House and discipline and strength. We are all really excited to work with him,” she said.

I am trying to find out what is the most successful formula moving forward: Joe Root,"Joe Root-led England were completely outplayed in the second Test. (Source: Reuters) Joe Root-led England were completely outplayed in the second Test. (Source: Reuters)

The England cricket team has drawn a lot of criticism for being inconsistent in the ongoing Test series against South Africa. Several questions were raised regarding their attitude after the defeat in the second Test. However, England came back strongly in the third Test to secure a thrilling win by 340 runs. This led Root to instil renewed confidence in his side and claim that England is trying to find out the most successful formula moving forward.

Recalling the performance in the second Test, he said, “We weren’t good enough at Trent Bridge and I think it was important that we sat down after that and found a way to come back from that,” said Joe Root ahead of the fourth Test at Old Trafford on Thursday (August 3). “The response the guys came up with was excellent.”

On the fourth Test, Root said, “It’s obviously a new challenge this week, and a slightly different frame of mind going into it,” and added, “There is no reason why we can’t do that [play well] again.”

Commenting on his captaincy reign Root said, “Early on in my captaincy, I am trying to find out what I want and what’s going to be the most successful formula moving forward. I suppose it’s very difficult to use Test matches as experiments but it’s important to find out what works early on so you have the opportunity to be more consistent and more successful.”

Stressing on the need for a balanced side, Root added, “You are trying to get the balance right between that consistency and making sure that we are playing a side that suits the surface that we come up against. Moving forward that is something we will have to get nailed down before we go to Australia. Hopefully, we will stumble across it very quickly.”

Venezuelan chief prosecutor’s office blocked by security forces,"FILE PHOTO: Venezuela’s chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz talks to the media during a news conference in Caracas, Venezuela April 25, 2017.

REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo

Venezuelan security forces took up positions outside the office of the country’s chief prosecutor on Saturday, a day after the government inaugurated a new legislative body that the prosecutor said was fraudulently elected. Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega had asked a local court to halt the inauguration of the country’s new 545-member constituent assembly, citing allegations that the government fudged the results of the vote that created it.

The new legislative body has no checks on its powers. It could re-write the constitution, re-arrange state institutions and allow socialist President Nicolas Maduro to rule by decree. Assembly members had said they would fire Ortega the first chance they got. It took less than 24 hours from the assembly’s inauguration for her offices to be cordoned off.

Ortega, in a tweet, asked the international community to denounce what she called “arbitrary action” of security forces blocking entrance to her offices. Luis Almagro, head of the Organization of American States, said he was concerned that evidence against Maduro’s government was at risk of being compromised by the security forces surrounding Ortega’s office.

“Aggression against her is aggression against all of us,” Almagro tweeted, adding that the presence of the security forces “puts evidence of human rights violations and corruption on the part of the (Maduro) regime at risk.” Since the opposition started a round of protests in April, Ortega has become the president’s main challenger from within the ruling socialist movement, accusing him of human rights abuses and of running roughshod over democracy.

The opposition, which won control of congress in 2015, boycotted Sunday’s vote, calling it a naked power grab by Maduro. The boycott meant that all candidates for the new assembly were from Maduro’s coalition, giving him carte blanche to pass laws aimed at locking his policies into place.

The assembly was installed despite opposition street protests. More than 120 people have died in four months of sustained marches against Maduro. Critics say his policies have pushed Venezuela into an economic crisis marked by triple digit inflation and severe shortages of food and medicine. Maduro says the U.S. “empire” is waging economic war on Venezuela and refuses to allow humanitarian aid to enter the country. He says the new assembly is the only way to unify Venezuela into a peaceful, prosperous socialist state.

Former Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez, a hard-line Maduro loyalist, was named president of the new assembly. “There is no humanitarian crisis here. What we have is love. What we have is a crisis of the right-wing fascists,” said Rodriguez, in a fiery inaugural address in which she paid homage to late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, Maduro’s mentor and predecessor.

The assembly will function in the same downtown Caracas legislative complex as the existing opposition-run congress, which could potentially be dissolved. For now, the two bodies are set to hold sessions in parallel, separated by an ornate cobblestone courtyard.

Jab Harry Met Sejal movie review: This Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma film is a dud,"Jab Harry Met Sejal movie review: The film comes off as a mix of Imtiaz Ali’s older films, in its flashes of Jab We Met, Tamasha and Love Aaj Kal. Jab Harry Met Sejal movie review: The film comes off as a mix of Imtiaz Ali’s older films, in its flashes of Jab We Met, Tamasha and Love Aaj Kal.

Jab Harry Met Sejal cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Anushka Sharma, Chandan Roy Sanyal

Jab Harry Met Sejal director: Imtiaz Ali

Jab Harry Met Sejal star rating: 1.5 stars

The title is smile-inducing. We know instantly that the aim of Harry meeting Sejal is to kick-start a romance between two unlikely individuals which is meant to grow gradually, skirting a curve here, ducking a bouncer there, till it locks in, into a glorious forever after.

Imtiaz Ali’s latest come-fall-in-love-on-the-road journey, starring Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma, touches those high points only very intermittently, making it a sadly missed opportunity: given Ali’s propensity to create mood and perky dialogue, and the fact that SRK and Sharma have worked well together in their previous pairings, this should rightly have been a knock-your-socks-off rom com.

But this, in one word, is a dud.

Harry (SRK) aka Harvinder is a travel guide in Europe. Sejal (Sharma) is in search of a lost ring. And when they meet, nothing happens very slowly. Good Gujju girl Sejal is loud and clear about her rights, and lets Harry, the dissolute, raffish rolling stone, know what’s what in no uncertain terms. But there really is nothing going on between them: it’s just a lot of yakkity-yak minus frisson.

What we do get is a trip through beautiful European spots, with Harry and Sejal trying to find what they are looking for. The ring is, of course, just a metaphor. Both are, of course, searching for the other.

What you need in such films with their flimsy one-line plots, is the magic and mystery of love blossoming between two people. And full-blown wonder. All in short supply in Jab Harry Met Sejal, which comes off as a same-old mix of Ali’s older films, in its flashes of Jab We Met, Tamasha and Love Aaj Kal.

Which leaves us searching too. For moments which show some spark between the two leads. ‘Sweet si’, ‘sister-type’ Sejal and the ‘chalu, chalta-hua, cheap’ Harry are much too fraternal with each other. We do see that fire, but all too briefly. And is this really how Gujju ‘bens’ talk? All ‘ne’ and ‘che’? Sharma is a game trier but rendered ineffective, and SRK fails his famed charm offensive, for the very first time: the director has a lot to answer for.

A still from Jab Harry Met Sejal. A still from Jab Harry Met Sejal.

The songs come and go, and except perhaps for a couple, they don’t really register, which is a let-down too, because Ali has given us some absolutely fabulous songs which work by way of telling us more: about the story, about the people singing those songs, about their motivations. There’s also a wholly superfluous diversion involving a ‘desi’ goon (Sanyal) whose only purpose seems to add length to the film. What is he doing here?

Finally, it comes down to counting the momentary pleasures of this disappointing film: a bit of the sparring between Harry and Sejal, the breathless awareness that the other exists, and the realization that without the other, it’s simply not worth it.

At this point in his career, Shah Rukh Khan is ripe for a great, old-fashioned but modern-day romance. This one is not it.

HS Prannoy and Sourabh Verma lost their respective quarterfinal matches in the men’s singles of the New Zealand Grand Prix Gold event in Auckland. This also marked an end to India’s campaign in the event.

Fourth ranked Prannoy gave a tough fight but couldn’t stop the in-form 11th seeded Chinese Taipei’s Lin Yu Hsien from winning a thrilling encounter in three games 10-21, 22-20 and 21-23. The match lasted for an hour and six minutes. On the other hand, seventh seed Verma lost to unseeded Lee Cheuk Yiu of Hong Kong 19-21, 16-21 in straight games.

Prannoy and Hsein were levelled at 8-8 in the first game but Hsein managed to grab three quick points and was leading by 11-10 at the interval. After the break, the fortunes shifted when Hsein continued to win 10 successive points, sealing the opening game 21-10.

In the second game, Prannoy and Hsein were levelled at 5-5 but Prannoy managed to grab a five point lead, taking his score to 13-8. The Taipei shuttler didn’t lose his hope and fought back in the game, levelling with Prannoy at 17-17.

Taking three consecutive points, Hsein was a point away from victory after making it 20-18 before Prannoy caught him at 20-20. Prannoy, at last, held on to his nerves, winning the next two points and pushed the match to the decider.

Both the shuttlers gave their best in the deciding game and the match reached a crucial stage as both were tied at 20-20 and then 21-21 but finally it was Hsein who managed to earn two crucial points to advance to the semifinals.

Meanwhile, Verma lost the plot at the break, trailing 6-11. After the interval, Lee didn’t provide any margin for error and continued to stretch his lead to 14-8 but Verma somehow managed to make it 12-14. Both shuttlers went neck-and-neck till 18-18, but at last, Lee had the last laugh, winning the game 21-19.

In the second game, Lee again took an 11-6 lead and from there on, Verma couldn’t make a comeback as the Hong Kong shuttler went on to register an easy win, winning the second game 21-16.

"Vice-President Mike Pence’s Balkans comments expose Washington’s Cold War ideology, says Russia","US Vice President Mike Pence. (REUTERS/Ints Kalnins) US Vice President Mike Pence. (REUTERS/Ints Kalnins)

Accusations made by US Vice President Mike Pence that Russia is working to divide the Balkans from the West are destabilising southern Europe and expose Washington’s Cold War mentality, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday. Pence made the comments on Wednesday in Montenegro on the final leg of a tour designed to reassure Eastern Europe of Washington’s commitment to its security despite doubts sowed by US President Donald Trump’s lukewarm support for NATO.

“It is regrettable to note that Washington is sliding ever deeper into the primitive ideology of the Cold War era, which is completely detached from reality,” the ministry said.

It had called on the United States to stop defaming Russia and its foreign policy, which it said was based on respect for allies and a readiness to work with international partners, the ministry said in a statement.

Trump signed into law new sanctions against Russia on Wednesday, a move Moscow said amounted to a full-scale trade war and an end to hopes for better ties with the new US administration.

Nijel Amos safely through in wide-open men’s 800 metres at World Athletics Championship,"Nijel Amos duly cruised through his heat in one minute 47.10 seconds – more than five seconds slower than his silver-medal winning time in 2012. (Source: Reuters) Nijel Amos duly cruised through his heat in one minute 47.10 seconds – more than five seconds slower than his silver-medal winning time in 2012. (Source: Reuters)

The injury-enforced absence of David Rudisha has left the door open for the men’s 800 metres title at the World Athletics Championships and half a dozen contenders, led by Nijel Amos, will fancy their chances following Saturday’s first round.

Botswana’s Amos won silver as an 18-year-old behind Rudisha’s world record-setting triumph on the same track in the Olympic final five years ago and although he has been an inconsistent performer since then, he arrived in London in good form on the back of three successive Diamond League victories.

He duly cruised through his heat in one minute 47.10 seconds – more than five seconds slower than his silver-medal winning time in 2012. Kenya will again expect to be in the medals and their big two had no problems as Emmanuel Korir, fastest in the world this year with 1:43.10 in Monaco three weeks ago, and Kipyegon Bett, the 19-year-old world junior champion advanced comfortably.

Donavan Brazier, 20, looks the brightest hope for an American medal and also qualified well by taking the final heat as the sunny morning was replaced by rain and thunder.

The near-full house created an atmosphere never seen for morning heats – other than at the same stadium in the 2012 Olympics – and athletes of all nationalities praised the fans.

“It was beautiful, I’ve never seen anything like it. I got to the last 100m and could just hear the roar,” said Briton Kyle Langford, who squeezed through as a fast loser.

“As soon as the gun went too you could hear the roar – it was a pretty amazing thing to be honest.”

"Raksha Bandhan 2017: Know the Importance, History and Significance of Raksha Bandhan Festival in India","There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia) There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia)

India as we know has a rich cultural heritage and while there are many festivals observed throughout the year, Raksha Bandhan holds a special place. It is the time when siblings celebrate the special bond of love between them. Sisters tie a thread/band around their brother’s wrist for his long life and happiness and in exchange he promises to protect his sibling from all evils. This year, Raksha Bandhan will be observed on August 7.

Origin of Raksha Bandhan

The exact origin of the festival that is celebrated joyously in India and Nepal is unknown, but there are are many interesting stories associated with it. The most popular one is from the Mahabharata and it acknowledges the relationship between Lord Krishna and Draupadi. According to the epic, one morning, when Lord Krishna was flying a kite, he cut his finger on the abrasive string. Draupadi, who was nearby, saw him bleeding profusely and ran to him. She then tore a piece from her sari and tied it around his finger. Lord Krishna was so touched that in return he promised to protect her from all evil, forever. And he did protect her all along, especially during her ‘cheerharan’ by the Kauravas.

There’s another interesting story involving Emperor Humayun and Rani Karnavati of Mewar. When Mewar was attacked twice by Bahadur Shah Zafar in the mid 16th century, she sent a letter with a rakhi to Humayun as a last resort, to help her. The emperor was so touched by the gesture that he immediately left the military campaign he was then involved in to protect her.

Interesting rituals

There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. In some parts of India, families draw figures and symbols on the walls of their homes and worship them with offerings of vermilion and kheer. Palm imprints are also used to decorate the entrance of a household where rakhis are stuck.

Singer Yash Wadali, who was arrested on charges of molesting a woman, was on Saturday granted bail by a magistrate’s court. The court granted bail to Wadali on a surety of Rs 20,000 with the condition that he would have to present himself before Bangur Nagar police every Monday.

Wadali was arrested on the complaint of a 39-year-old woman who alleged that he had abused her at a birthday party in Goregaon where he was performing. According to the victim, Wadali had grabbed her by her collar and abused her. His anticipatory bail filed before the Dindoshi court was rejected last week, following which he was arrested.

"Mubarakan movie review: A long, maudlin harangue on family values","Mubarakan movie review: The only way to differentiate between the two characters of Arjun Kapoor is the degree of bumbling idiocy displayed. Mubarakan movie review: The only way to differentiate between the two characters of Arjun Kapoor is the degree of bumbling idiocy displayed.

Mubarakan movie director: Anees Bazmee

Mubarakan movie cast: Anil Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor, Ileana D’Cruz, Athiya Shetty, Neha Sharma, Ratna Pathak Shah, Karan Kundra, Rahul Dev

Mubarakan star rating: 1.5 stars

I was prepared to sigh my way through this latest from the Anees Bazmee school of mindless comedies. But soon after it started laying out its wares, I began smiling. Wait, were we actually in for some good mindless fun? To begin with, I have to say that Mubarkan has a faint semblance of a plot, which comes as a relief given what we’ve been subjected to in his last outing (Welcome Back).

Then there’s Arjun Kapoor as a set of twins, one in Punjab, the other in London. The only way to differentiate between them is the degree of bumbling idiocy displayed, and Kapoor does a good line in that department. Add in Anil Kapoor as the ‘maama/chacha’ shuttling between the two boys. I’m always happy to watch Kapoor because he gets with the plan so fast, and once in a while, does a nice throw-away dialogue.

Pretty girls Ileana D’Cruz, Neha Sharma and Athiya Shetty show up, the former getting in a line or two. Sharma plays a Muslim girl (‘haaye haaye’) in love with one of the brawny Punjabi ‘mundas’, and you cheer, just a little, because hey, who knows, we may be in for some inter-religious amity. And a comedy of errors is set into motion, revolving around reluctant grooms and runaway brides, and a good Punjabi ‘praa’ (Pavan Malhotra) and his equally loving ‘bainji’ (Shah).

So far, I’m not wincing. And then the post-interval set is upon us, and suddenly, the film’s funny bone gets lost. It becomes a long, maudlin harangue on family values and good sisters and brothers, while slipping in a few distasteful jokes about wives and women. And that Muslim girl angle? It is just a ruse, and a total cop-out.

A character says wearily: ‘kab khatam hoga yeh?’ And that’s the end of that.

US poll data expert working for Kenya opposition arrested,"Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, the presidential candidate of the National Super Alliance (NASA) party, delivers a speach during an election rally in Suswa, Kenya, August 2, 2017.

REUTERS/Baz Ratner

Kenyan police arrested an American election data expert working with opposition leader Raila Odinga’s National Super Alliance (NASA) ahead of Aug. 8 polls, an opposition senator and the US embassy said on Saturday. Senator James Orengo said John Aristotle Phillips, chief executive of political technology and data provider Aristotle Inc., was detained late on Friday along with a Canadian national, whom he did not name. The pair were being deported, he added.

Besides his work on political data analysis, Phillips is known in the United States as the “A-Bomb Kid” for designing an atomic weapon from publicly available information while studying as an undergraduate at Princeton in the 1970s. “The police invaded their apartment,” Orengo told a news conference, adding that the pair were manhandled and thrown into the back of a vehicle.

The U.S. embassy in Nairobi confirmed that an American and a Canadian had been detained and were leaving the east African country ahead of Tuesday’s electoral showdown between Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta. “They’re safe & departing Kenya,” the embassy said on Twitter, without elaborating.

Two police spokesmen contacted by Reuters did not answer their phones or respond to text messages requesting comment. Opinion polls suggest Kenyatta, the son of Kenya’s first president, and Odinga, who is fighting his fourth presidential election, are neck-and-neck, leading many Kenyans to fear a disputed result and possible violence.

Odinga told Reuters this week Kenyatta could only win by rigging the vote, a stance that intensified public concerns of violence after the murder of a senior election commission technology expert. Kenyatta responded by challenging Odinga to produce the evidence.

In 2007, Odinga’s call for demonstrations after a disputed result triggered ethnic clashes in which at least 1,200 people were killed. He also disputed the outcome of a 2013 election but limited his complaints to the courts, not the streets. The BBC said this week Kenyatta’s ruling Jubilee Party had hired Cambridge Analytica, another data-mining company, to advise its campaign. Cambridge Analytica was also used by Donald Trump in his U.S. presidential run.

Murders Most Foul,"Into the Water Paula Into the Water Paula

Book name: Into the Water

Author: Paula Hawkins

Publisher: Penguin

Pages: 353

Price: 599

The exhilaration of the first dive is something that every swimmer worth her salt will vouch for. The rush of air and the heady surge of adrenaline as your body hits the water, the sudden blanketing of all noise, and then, as one surfaces, the feeling of being vitally alive. Paula Hawkins’s second novel after her bestselling debut, The Girl on the Train, however, never recovers from the dive. It pitches headlong into dark, murky waters in the town of Beckford in Northumberland, and then, for the rest of the novel, flounders as it tries to break to the surface, much like her protagonist, Jules Abbott.

A visit from the police informing her about her estranged sister Nel’s accidental death brings Jules back to the one place she has always wanted to escape: their home in Beckford, close to the Drowning Pool, the site of many childhood humiliations. Jules hates the water, but she knows Nel, an accomplished swimmer, could not possibly have drowned. What could have killed her then? Was it her probing into the many mysterious drownings at the pool over the years, including the recent one of her daughter’s best friend?

After all, Nel had written in her manuscript, “Beckford is not a suicide spot. Beckford is a place to get rid of troublesome women.” Living up to the glory of a first novel that has sold over 18 million copies is a tough ask. Hawkins somersaults off to an atmospheric start, before she introduces over 10 narrative voices to carry forward the thread of the mystery. It’s an ambitious project and you can see how the author wants to tie it up with a commentary on how women who have dared to rebel have been bedevilled down the ages. But, after a point, the narrative begins to feel laboured, the structure cumbersome and the mystery, tepid. It’s a bit of a letdown, because Hawkins has a definite pulse for mapping the fallibilities of commonplace lives. Perhaps, it will find its voice in a movie.

Party Girls Die in Pearls Party Girls Die in Pearls

Book name: Party Girls Die in Pearls

Author: Plum Sykes

Publisher: Bloomsbury

Pages: 335

Price: 499

It’s Gossip Girl-meets-Agatha Christie in this murder mystery set in the Oxford University of 1985. Plum Sykes, contributing editor at the American Vogue, plays it right up her alley and sets her return to fiction in nearly a decade among the rich and decadent set at Britain’s most prestigious arts university (incidentally, also her alma mater).

Ursula Flowerbutton fetches up at Christminster College campus from her modest Gloucestershire farmhouse in the Cotswold for a course in Modern History, and finds herself immediately drawn into a world of posh, private school-educated undergraduates with a penchant for parties, punting and the latest fashion. Before Ursula can find her feet, she’s swept into a whodunit when she discovers the body of India Brattenbury, the snootiest girl in the pack, in her don’s study. Can she solve the mystery and earn herself a reporter’s post in the prestigious college paper Cherwell? Assisted by her friend, Nancy Feingold, a feisty American Exchange student, Ursula is determined to follow the case to its sordid end, except, that the murderer seems to be just a step ahead of her.

Sykes’s first book in what is to be an Oxford Girl Mystery series is a cheat’s guide to easy detection, a light and escapist read very far from the intense crime fictions in the market. Instead of gritty realism and psychological twists, there’s a liberal sprinkling of fashion trends (pixie boots, body-con dresses and ra-ra skirts, anyone?) and a droll sense of humour in Syke’s portrayal of Oxford’s champagne set (Horatio Bentley, Cherwell’s gossip columnist, in particular, is a hoot). If you want to catch up on the ’80s lookbook (and why not, seeing that retro is never quite out of vogue), go right ahead and take the plunge.

Don’t Let Go Don’t Let Go

Book name: Don’t Let Go

Author: Michel Bussi (Translated by Sam Taylor)

Publisher: Orion Books (Hachette)

Pages: 324

Price: 399

The Bellions – Martial, Liane and their six-year-old daughter Sopha – are the picture-perfect prototype of a happy family that resorts in exotic island destinations want to show off in their tourist brochures. But then, on one such vacation in Reunion Island, Liane goes up to the hotel room to change, leaving Martial and Sopha lounging in the pool, and disappears. Just as the needle of suspicion hovers towards Martial, he goes on the run with Sopha.

If the premise of Michel Bussi’s latest sounds familiar, you’d do well to give up preconceived notions. Bussi is a consummate artist, the least of whose strengths is range. His dazzling debut novel in English, After the Crash (2015), was followed by the long-drawn and unexpected Black Water Lilies; now, the Frenchman tries his hand at a well-worn trope and brings it to a startling denouement. Don’t Let Go is a cracker of a thriller – terse, taut, and always moving at a frantic pace, but the chase is only half the fun.

Like in his previous novels, the setting is of essence in the world Bussi builds up — under his careful scrutiny, the cauldron that is Reunion comes alive as he teases out the racial tensions simmering beneath the surface. There are moments of unexpected and deep tenderness, a sort of reprieve from the breathless pace of the hunt. Perhaps, the most endearing members of Bussi’s varied cast are the investigating officers — Aja Purvi and her second-in-command, Christos Konstantinov — each trying to tame their demons and make the best of the deal life has served them and only half succeeding at it. At once familiar and ingenuous, Don’t Let Go is another hat tip to Bussi’s fine craftsmanship.

The Girl Before The Girl Before

Book name: The Girl Before

Author: JP Delaney

Publisher: Quercus Books

Pages: 406

Price: 399

Searching for a decent apartment in the city on a limited budget is the stuff of modern nightmares, but, what if you were given a chance to live in a hi-tech apartment — a coveted architect’s dream house — at a minimal rent, should you pass his stringent screening process?

Emma and Jane, the narrators of JP Delaney’s debut novel, are both recovering from trauma when the chance to live at One Folgate Street in the heart of London opens up for them. Its architect, the rich, handsome and quirky Edward Monkton, is an advocate of Marie Kondo-esque minimalist living and both girls have to get past his eccentric grilling, often bordering on intrusion, to live there.

The house itself is the sort that features in Architectural Digest – impersonal, clutter-free and technology-reliant. Photosensitive windows anticipate the change in weather, the internet is differently-abled within the premises, restricting Google and Safari and allowing only the impersonal ‘Housekeeper’ to set the terms of usage. Compliance is non-negotiable — there are sensors and cameras monitoring the tenant’s every shot at self-improvement. As the story jumps between ‘Then: Emma’ and ‘Now: Jane’, Delaney builds up a taut mirror-image narrative where the girls seem to follow a set pattern orchestrated by Monkton, that includes having an affair with him on the lines of Fifty Shades of Grey. Will Jane escape Emma’s fate?

There’s a cast of extraneous characters, who weigh in with their opinions about Emma and Jane, neither of whom are built up in great detail, despite sharing their every thought with the reader. Delaney follows the commercially viable model of Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, throwing in an unreliable narrator to shake things up. For all their similarities, Emma and Jane are very different people and come to different (and difficult) ends. The denouement is the biggest letdown, particularly after the riveting turn of events leading up to it. But, Delaney certainly has an unerring eye for cinematic detail and pace, traits that won the book a contract to be turned into a film by Ron Howard before its publication.

German ministers and car makers meet under pressure to tackle pollution,"German government find ways to cut diesel emissions and stave off moves by some cities to ban polluting vehicles. (File Photo) German government find ways to cut diesel emissions and stave off moves by some cities to ban polluting vehicles. (File Photo)

German ministers and car executives will meet on Wednesday to try to find ways to cut diesel emissions and stave off moves by some cities to ban polluting vehicles. Since Volkswagen admitted to cheating US diesel emissions tests in September 2015, the German government has come under fire for not doing enough to crack down on vehicle pollution and for being too close to the country’s powerful auto industry. With national elections less than eight weeks away, and environmental groups making progress in the courts, the government is keen to show it is taking action.

But ministers are also wary of damaging an industry that is a major source of export income and provides about 800,000 jobs. Industry and government sources said on Tuesday that car makers would probably be spared making costly hardware changes to engines and would instead be required to carry out software updates to around 2 million vehicles.

Whether that will be enough to revive diesel vehicle sales or stop bans like one planned for Stuttgart that was confirmed by a regional court last week is another matter. “Software updates are better than nothing, but I have doubts this deal will persuade people to start buying diesels again,” said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think tank near Cologne.

Volkswagen’s (VW) emissions crisis led to a string of revelations that showed diesel vehicles from most manufacturers release far more toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) on the road than in laboratory tests used to assess their safety. That has hit sales of diesel vehicles in Germany, with buyers worried about potential driving restrictions, causing a big headache for car makers that were betting on diesel technology to meet rules on lowering carbon dioxide emissions.

There are around 15 million diesel cars on Germany’s roads, which contribute around 40 percent to NOx pollution in major cities, according to the DUH environmental lobby. The stakes have increased in recent weeks. Britain and France have turned up the pressure on Berlin by announcing plans to eventually ban all diesel and petrol vehicles, while top German carmakers BMW, Daimler, Audi , Porsche and VW are being investigated by European regulators for alleged anti-competitive collusion.

“The car industry is wrapped up in a prolonged crisis of confidence,” Bratzel said. “It’s high time for automakers to make a contribution to get out of this mess.”

Senator John McCain urges Trump administration to resolve differences on Afghanistan,"Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain. Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain.

Asserting that the prime reason for America’s failure in Afghanistan is a “lack of successful policy and strategic guidance” from Washington, Top Republican Senator John McCain on Thursday urged the White House to resolve its internal differences on the Afghan policy. “The reason for this failure is a lack of successful policy and strategic guidance from Washington over many years, which has continued in the first several months of this new administration. Our commanders-in-chief, not our commanders in the field, are responsible for this failure,” he said.

McCain, the Chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, was responding to a news report that President Donald Trump wants to fire his commander in Afghanistan Gen John Nicholson.

“Gen Nicholson has served our country with honour and distinction for 35 years. He has earned the trust and admiration of those he has served with. And he has earned my full confidence,” McCain said as he referred to the testimony of Nicholson before the Armed Services Committee.

Six months ago, Gen Nicholson testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee and warned that the United States was not winning the war in Afghanistan, said Trump who differed with both Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama on the US policy in Afghanistan.

Trump, who participated in a veteran’s health related event in the Roosevelt Office of the White House, however, did not respond to a shouted question on news reports that he wants to fire Gen Nicholson.

Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy told MSNBC that Trump isn’t wrong in the sense that US policy in Afghanistan has failed in as much as that its goal was to rid Afghanistan of the Taliban.

“The irony of all of this is that I think, by now, we should have figured out a military-only solution in Afghanistan will never work. That unless you purge that government of corruption, unless you give it legitimacy with the Afghanistan people, the Taliban will always be on the edges of that country ready to come back in,” Murphy said.

Six more die of swine flu in various parts of Gujarat,"Two deaths were reported in Ahmedabad, while one each in Jamnagar, Valsad, Rajkot and Vadodara. (Representational image) Two deaths were reported in Ahmedabad, while one each in Jamnagar, Valsad, Rajkot and Vadodara. (Representational image)

As many as six persons died of swine flu across Gujarat on Saturday. According to the health department, two deaths were reported in Ahmedabad, while one each in Jamnagar, Valsad, Rajkot and Vadodara. In Ahmedabad, a 45-year-old man died in L G Hospital, while a woman succumbed to swine flu in V S Hospital. The 45-year-old, a resident of Vatva was admitted to L G Hospital on Thursday. The woman was brought to V S Hospital a day before. “There have been six deaths today (Saturday) due to swine flu,” confirmed Dr Jayanti Ravi, Commissioner of Health, Medical Services and Medical Education.

He said they were spreading awareness about swine flu. “Through various medical associations, we are making sure that there is awareness among doctors. Prolonged fever, along with cold and weakness, are some of the symptoms and doctors should not delay in starting the medicines. Swine flu drugs are now available on prescription at all chemist shops. We have also started distributing an ayurvedic ukalo (drink) to help boost immunity,”said Ravi. He added: “We are still away from the 2015 swine flu figures and hoping that through awareness we see lesser number of cases this time.”

According to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation records, the city reported 15 swine flu cases in the last 24 hours. The total cases reported this year are 182 and the number of deaths 23.

China realises North Korea is becoming greater threat: US official,"A TV news program shows a file image of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, May 14, 2017.

China has realised that nuclear-armed North Korea is becoming a greater threat to its security and is working to address the challenge posed by Pyongyang, a top US official has said. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Susan Thornton said that as many as 90 per cent of North Korea’s economy is still flowing through China, so Beijing has more leverage on North Korea than any other country. “We’re working with them currently to continue to step up enforcement of sanctions and to try to levy additional sanctions, so I think we have to keep working on that track,” Thornton said.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson heads to the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia later this week as part of the Trump administration’s policy to strengthen relationship with countries in the Asia pacific region, many of whom are concerned about the increasing Chinese assertiveness.

The US, she said has been working with China on North Korea. “What we think we’ve seen today in the way of cooperation, which we have seen significant steps taken by China to increase pressure on North Korea — frankly, unprecedented steps,” Thornton said. “We do have indications that China is extremely concerned about North Korea and extremely unhappy with the direction things are going. They realise that this is becoming a greater threat to China’s own security, and we see a growing determination on their part to take steps to try to address the situation seriously,” Thornton said.

Such a statement from a state department official gains significance given news reports that the White House is planning to impose some kind of sanctions on China because it is not taking any steps against its close ally North Korea. “We and China have the same goal, which is denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, and so we share a mutual interest there and we want to find out how we can work more effectively together to bring about that change in North Korea that we would like to see,” she said.

“On the issues of trade, it has also been a prominent topic of discussion. We’ve had the US-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue here in Washington DC recently that discussed the full gamut of trade and investment and economic issues, and that discussion is continuing and we’ve got a number of hundred-day plans in the works to negotiate resolution and show concrete progress in that relationship,” the official said.

The US and China can have a productive relationship if the two countries can work together on the issue of North Korea.

Thornton said the Trump administration would continue to be engaged in the Asia Pacific region. “On the issue of the rebalance, I think that slogans are sometimes overrated or overused, but certainly, what the rebalance was trying to denote was that the US is an Asia Pacific power, we’re going to be engaged in the Asia Pacific region, we’re a provider of security in the region, it’s key to our prosperity and our economic future, and we are going to pay a lot of attention to Asia…,” she said.

“So I think you’ve seen the engagement by so many high-level officials, with leaders coming here, with our high-level cabinet officials going there, with the president’s trip upcoming later this fall, so I think it’s really just a matter of naming it. I think I would say our active engagement is frankly continuing and is not going to be changing anytime soon,” Thornton said.

The US has sent aircraft carrier-led strike group to the Korean peninsula to step up pressure against North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un to refrain from developing a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile capable of reaching mainland US.

Haryana teachers prohibited from use of mobile phone in class,"In case of emergency, the school head and the second senior in-charge, or clerk, should keep a contact number each, the guidelines say.

Teachers in Haryana are now prohibited from using mobile phones in classrooms. The state government on Thursday released a set of guidelines which requires teaches not to bring their mobile phones to the classrooms unless it is an academic emergency.

“If a teacher happens to head the institution, they will have to take care that neither they nor other teachers indulge in this fancy as fresh guidelines have been issued by the Haryana Education Department in this regard. It (mobile phone) shall be kept stashed away in the staff room or in an area earmarked by the head of school…If for some unavoidable reasons, mobile phone is required to be taken to the class-room for academic use by a teacher, prior permission should be taken from the head of school for reasons to be recorded in a register to be maintained for this purpose,” the guidelines say.

In case of emergency, the school head and the second senior in-charge, or clerk, should keep a contact number each, the guidelines say, adding that mobile phones can be utilised in a confined area away from the classrooms to save students from the disturbance and external influence of mobile phones.

“All inspecting officers, whether on regular inspection or surprise inspections, shall check whether compliance of these instructions is being made meticulously or not. In case of any violation, action against the head of school shall be proposed by the inspecting officer. If any substantive complaint is received from students or general public, that the guidelines are being violated on a campus, the head of that school shall be held squarely accountable,” the statement says.

The guidelines pointed out that teachers are using mobile phones in classrooms for personal instead of professional reasons and this is diverting the teaching hours to unproductive activities and hampering teachers’ contribution to academics.

“Mobile phone has recently emerged as the single gadget which has started consuming class time of some teachers. Social media or other entertainment scopes of mobile phones hardly contribute anything towards the syllabus which is to be taught to the students on the school campus,” the guidelines say. They add that the mobile phones may be used for creative teaching purposes.

Woman hockey player found dead on rail track,"Jyoti Gupta Jyoti Gupta

An India international hockey player, 20-year-old Jyoti Gupta, allegedly committed suicide by jumping in front of a Chandigarh-Jaipur train near the railway flyover at the Rewari-Rohtak section on Wednesday night. Gupta, who hails from Sonepat, had represented India in the South Asian Games in 2016, played as a forward and had also represented India in the Five-Nation international Junior hockey tournament played in Valencia last year.

She had also played in the All India Universities team in the Senior National Hockey Championships (A Division) at Rohtak in May earlier this year “It was a case of suicide. We went there and inspected the spot and also talked with the driver of Chandigarh-Jaipur train. The girl was standing alone near the track and suddenly came in front of the train. We have recorded the statement of the driver and also recorded statements of other officials who were present at the spot. No case had been registered and the body has been handed to the family,” said Balbir Singh. SHO, Railway GRP Police, Rewari.

Gupta, had left her home in ward No: 25, Sonepat to go to Maharishi Dayanand University on Wednesday and told her parents that she needs to correct her name in the university documents. She had left her home at 11 a.m and had last talked with her mother at 5.30 p.m on Wednesday evening. Later, when her body was found on the railway tracks at 10 p.m, a GRP police team consisting of ASI Umed Singh and ASI Urmila Devi reached the spot and informed Gupta’s parents.

“We informed her father Pramod Gupta and the family told us that she had left her home for some work in Rohtak on Wednesday morning,” added Balbir Singh.

Aditi Ashok misses cut at Women’s British Open,"Aditi Ashok missed her second straight Major cut as she failed to advance to the weekend rounds at the Ricoh Women’s British Open. (Source: File) Aditi Ashok missed her second straight Major cut as she failed to advance to the weekend rounds at the Ricoh Women’s British Open. (Source: File)

Aditi Ashok missed her second straight Major cut as she failed to advance to the weekend rounds at the Ricoh Women’s British Open. Aditi, who had a first round card of 76 and had five birdies in her second round, dropped three doubles and one bogey to come back with a score of two-over 74.

With a total of six-over 150, she missed the cut by a huge margin. Aditi had earlier made cuts at ANA Inspiration and KPMG, while missed the cut at US Women’s Open.

She has played all four Majors so far this year. The cut fell at one-under and many names fell by the wayside on a day when the rain poured down on Kingsbarns Golf Links.

In-Kyung Kim used her experience of two decades to manage a four-under par, 68 in cold and windy conditions to lead at the halfway mark of the season’s fourth major championship.

Kim sits at 11-under par, two-strokes ahead of Lexi Thompson and Georgia Hall. Two behind Kim sits Lexi Thompson, whose secret weapon this week has been her caddie Kevin McAlpine, a former bagman at Kingsbarns Golf Links, who has guided Thompson around the course like a seasoned veteran.

At four-over par, defending champion Ariya Jutanugarn missed the cut in her third consecutive major championship, due in large part to a second round 77 that included a nine at the par 3, 12th hole.

The cut line fell at one-under par which sends home notables Nelly Korda (E), Suzann Pettersen (E), Minjee Lee (+1), Karrie Webb (+3) and Danielle Kang (+3).

"US judge sets $30,000 bail for UK hacker who stopped ‘WannaCry’ malware attack","Hutchins, also known online as MalwareTech, was indicted along with an unnamed co-defendant on July 12. Hutchins, also known online as MalwareTech, was indicted along with an unnamed co-defendant on July 12.

A US judge in Las Vegas set a $30,000 bail on Friday for a well-known British cyber security researcher accused of advertising and selling malicious code used to pilfer banking and credit card information. Marcus Hutchins, 23, gained celebrity status within the hacker community in May when he was credited with neutralizing the global “WannaCry” ransomware attack.

His attorney, Adrian Lobo, told reporters Hutchins would not be released on Friday because the clerk’s office for the court closed 30 minutes after his hearing concluded, leaving his defense team not enough time to post the bail.

Lobo told a local NBC affiliate that Hutchins would be released on Monday and that she expected him to be on a flight on Tuesday to Wisconsin, where a six-count indictment against him was filed in U.S. District Court. He was receiving support from a “variety of sources” around the world to post his bail, she said.

Judge Nancy Koppe dismissed a federal prosecutor’s claim that Hutchins was a flight risk, though she did order him to surrender his passport. If released, Hutchins would be barred from computer use or internet access.

Hutchins, also known online as MalwareTech, was indicted along with an unnamed co-defendant on July 12. The case remained under seal until Thursday, a day after his arrest in Las Vegas, where he and tens of thousands of others flocked for the annual Black Hat and Def Con security conventions.

Hutchins allegedly advertised, distributed and profited from malware code known as “Kronos” between July 2014 and 2015, according to the indictment. If downloaded from email attachments, Kronos left victims’ systems vulnerable to theft of banking and credit card credentials, which could have been used to siphon money from bank accounts.

He achieved overnight fame in May when he was credited with detecting a “kill switch” that effectively disabled the WannaCry worm, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers in May and caused disruptions at car factories, hospitals, shops and schools in more than 150 countries.

Hutchins was “doing well, considering what’s gone on,” Lobo, told reporters. She said Hutchins never expected to be in his current situation and that she did not know the identity of his co-defendant.

News of Hutchins’ arrest on Wednesday shocked other researchers, many of whom rallied to his defense and said they did not believe he had ever engaged in cyber crime.

State of the Union,"Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran. Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran.

The flaws in India’s internal security management and how it impacts our image in international fora

Title: Keeping India Safe: The Dilemma of Internal Security

Author: Vappala Balachandran

Publisher: Harper Collins

Pages: 328 pages

Price: Rs 599

Internal security provides the foundation for external security and our prestige in international fora. If there are a hundred points of insurgency, disaffection or rebellion, those weaken the social structure and hamper economic growth, and news about these unrests affects other countries’ judgement about our handling of sensitive matters. Unfortunately, our policy makers have not paid adequate attention to this vital sector and their threat responses have been influenced more by political considerations than strategic vision. Much was expected of the NDA government, but unfortunately, it has also disappointed — so far, at least.

Balachandran’s book on internal security is a valuable addition to the literature on the subject. He has drawn our attention to fundamental flaws in the Constitution which are adversely affecting our handling of internal security challenges. The founding fathers, as he says, copied the Act of 1935 while dividing Centre-state subjects without considering whether it would safeguard national integrity in times of turbulence. They should have given concurrent responsibility to the Centre to deal with national security threats, and not doing so was “certainly a lapse”. This view is supported by leading Constitutional experts like Fali Nariman. Not that the government is unaware of it, but it fears opposition from states. The reality has to be faced, and the sooner we do it the better.

Balachandran is on target when he says that after 26/11, the nation was united against the scourge of terrorism, and that it was an ideal opportunity to amend the Constitution and create a federal police which would investigate terror and other cases which had all-India ramifications. “What was however produced was a partly empowered police (the NIA)”. It was a “leadership failure” of the UPA government.

The author also writes of institutions which are either dysfunctional or have no statutory basis. The National Security Council, which should have played a key role, is one of these, thanks to its unclear charter. The National Security Advisory Board is a collection of the best brains in the field of security, but the government has not made use of this vast reservoir of talent. What is worse, the organisation became defunct under the NDA regime, though lately, it has been revived in an emaciated form. The Crisis Management Group could never rise to the occasion, whether in the assassination of Mrs Indira Gandhi or the hijacking of IC-814 or the 26/11 attack. The Intelligence Bureau should have an oversight mechanism and be made accountable. The CBI also requires a legal mandate and greater autonomy in personnel and finance. The Ministry of Home Affairs has become unwieldy and needs to be bifurcated, with a separate division for internal security alone. All these are valuable points and need to be acted upon at the highest level.

The most interesting chapter deals with 26/11. It clearly brings out that the Centre had not passed on any specific intelligence to the State, that the police had reacted promptly with their available resources, and that there was no serious lapse. But the state government could have tightened coastal surveillance and made provisions for equipment and arms easier for the police. The political leadership and bureaucracy were to blame for that. Were they held accountable? Why the Centre didn’t institute an inquiry into the lapses of 26/11 remains a mystery to this day. According to knowledgeable people, the inquiry was not set up because several senior officers in Delhi would have been found guilty.

The NDA government, according to the author, has shown “no interest in revising the stagnant thinking on national security”. The indictment is a bit harsh. The government has taken some initiatives to improve the police and tackle Maoists, but these efforts have not been as comprehensive as was required. The author has also faulted the NDA government for “immaturely” dealing with the Naga problem. The brain behind the framework agreement with the NSCN (IM) was of one of the finest officers of the country. If the framework could not be given a final shape, it is essentially because of the duplicity of the Naga leaders.

The book is full of facts and figures on foreign security agencies. Researchers would find these useful. But William Henry Sleeman has been given more space than he deserved. The detailed accounts of thuggee are, nevertheless, interesting.

US President Donald Trump signs sanctions against Russia as punishment for meddling in election,"US President Donald Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin US President Donald Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed into law a bill imposing new US sanctions on Russia. As per Reuters, two White House officials said the president signed the bill Wednesday morning. The package of stiff financial sanctions against Russia passed Congress with overwhelming support. Moscow has already responded to the sanctions by ordering a reduction in the number of U.S. diplomats in Russia. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly before the official statement.

In a move that is bound to anger Russia, the US Congress had passed the Russians sanctions bill last week in a bid to punish Russia over its alleged interference in the 2016 presidential elections, annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea and some other violations of international norms. Trump, who has made it amply clear that he wants to improve relations with Russia, however grudgingly accepted the new congressional sanctions. The bill had enough support in Congress to override a presidential veto.

Donald Trump’s signing of the Russia sanctions bill followed some conflicting signals from the administration in about the sanctions. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the media that he and the President did not believe the new sanctions would “be helpful to our efforts” on diplomacy with Russia. Vice-President Mike Pence said the bill showed Trump and Congress were speaking “with a unified voice.”

In the meantime, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway confirmed the signing of the bill.

Although Donald Trump’s desires better relations with Russia, his efforts have been repeatedly faced hurdles by findings of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered to help the Republican against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. U.S. congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. The Russian rouble weakened slightly following the initial report that Trump had signed the bill.

On Friday, Russian’s Foreign Ministry ordered a reduction in the number of US diplomatic personnel in Russia by Sept. 1. It had also closed down two American properties in Russia in retaliation.

In a statement to ABC channel, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov had said, “I think this retaliation is long, long overdue. After the Senate, the day before yesterday voted, or rather on the 27th of July voted so overwhelmingly on a completely weird and unacceptable piece of legislation, it was the last drop.”

"We’ve got a different brand of cricket now, says Paul Nixon","Jamaica Tallawahs won the second edition of CPL. (Source: Facebook) Jamaica Tallawahs won the second edition of CPL. (Source: Facebook)

With the Carribean Premier League set to begin, Jamaica Tallawahs coach Paul Nixon is looking to rebuild the side with some fresh and new talent. Nixon claimed that with the exit of the old guard which includes the likes of Chris Gayle and Andre Russel new and fresh talent will help them their defend the title.

In an interview with ESPNcricinfo, he said, “We’ve got a different brand of cricket now. We had a lot more hitters then, now we have to be a lot smarter.” and added, “For us, Andre Russell is a frustrating one. But we’ve got world-class players coming in. We’ve got Lendl Simmons, who had an outstanding IPL and for us to have his quality and his experience, I think he’s going to be one of the men of the tournament. We’ve got some other good young guys in the side as well.”

One of the players Nixon is looking at for the future is Odean Smith. Speaking about him he said, “We’ve got Odean Smith, who is a really attacking batsman, bowls the very high 80s, pushing 90 mph and is a really attacking fielder. He’s going to bring a massive amount of positivity. Some of the older guys, having Chris out of the field… Chris cost us a few runs in the field because he was an older guy who struggled a bit with his knee and his back. We’re an exciting fielding unit and now we’ve got to be a little bit smarter without the big hitters.”

Rough start for Aditi Ashok at British Open,"Aditi Ashok off to a rough start at British Open. (Source: File) Aditi Ashok off to a rough start at British Open. (Source: File)

Aditi Ashok’s campaign at the Women’s British Open Championships was off to a sluggish start as she shot a four-over 76 in the opening round at Kingbarns.

The 19-year-old Indian golfer was lying T-131st needing to pull in a very strong second round to ensure weekend action. She has made the cut in two of the first three Majors in her rookie season on the LPGA.

Aditi had just two birdies on fifth and eighth, but she dropped shots on third, fourth and then a double on par-4 10th before two more bogeys on 14th and 16th for a 76.

Michelle Wie shot a women’s course record eight-under-par 64 in fair conditions at Kingsbarns Golf Links to take a one stroke lead.

Wie, who is looking to make her fifth Solheim Cup appearance for the United States team later this month, is a stroke ahead of South Korean In-Kyung Kim, who won the Marathon Classic on the LPGA Tour a fortnight ago.

Lindy Duncan from the United States was a stroke behind in the third position.

The Britons were especially inspired, with English pair Mel Reid and Jodi Ewart Shadoff tied for fourth place on five-under-par, alongside Anne Van Dam from the Netherlands, Chella Choi of South Korea and Lexi Thompson of the United States.

Dame Laura Davies, who qualified for her 37th consecutive appearance in the championship, was in vintage form as she shot a 68 for a share of ninth position with compatriots Charley Hull and Georgia Hall, Swede Anna Nordqvist and American trio Ally McDonald, Morgan Pressel and Jaye Marie Green.

Davies had been six-under through 14 holes before the first of two weather delays, due to the threat of lightning, but after a torrential downpour and a one-hour suspension, she double bogeyed the 15th and then dropped another shot at the 16th only to birdie the 18th hole.

"Garbine Muguruza cruises, Petra Kvitova eliminated at Stanford Classic","Garbine Muguruza moved into the semi-finals. (Source: Reuters) Garbine Muguruza moved into the semi-finals. (Source: Reuters)

Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza made short work of Ana Konjuh to move into the semi-finals of the Stanford Classic on Friday, while second seed Petra Kvitova was thrashed 6-2 6-0 by 18-year-old American Catherine Bellis.

Top seed Muguruza, playing in the first match of the day, eased through her quarter-final 6-1 6-3 against the fifth seed at Stanford University in California, breaking the 19-year-old Croat five times in a match that lasted barely an hour.

“I think today I was very accurate,” said the Spaniard in an on-court interview. “Ana is such a powerful player and super young, I knew I had to be concentrated.

“I had to match her, be aggressive as well. I’m happy that I did it, and that it didn’t turn bad in the second set.

“I think she served a little bit better, and did less mistakes … made the match a little bit more equal. It was a little tougher in the second set.”

Local product Bellis is one of three Americans in the semi-finals along with Coco Vandeweghe and Madison Keys.

Kvitova dropped the first game to love on serve and it did not get much better from there as she ran up 26 unforced errors.

The Czech missed six months after being stabbed in her left hand by an intruder at her home in the Czech Republic in December.

Bellis, ranked 44th in the world, will take on fellow Californian Vandeweghe in a Saturday semi-final, while Muguruza will face third-seed Keys.

Brazil forward Neymar has officially joined Paris Saint-Germain from Barcelona in world-record deal. PSG in a statement said “his arrival into the Paris Saint-Germain family emphasizes more than ever the club’s aims to rise to the top of world football.” Earlier, Barcelona said in a statement on their website that his legal representatives “visited in person the club’s offices and made the payment of 222 million euros in the player’s name with regards to the unilateral termination of the contract that united both parties.”

Here’s how social media has to say after world-record transfer.

BCCI national selectors want pay rise,"It has been learnt from a top official that BCCI received a few proposals on the revised pay structure. (Source: Express Archive) It has been learnt from a top official that BCCI received a few proposals on the revised pay structure. (Source: Express Archive)

National selectors both junior and senior have requested the BCCI to revise their salaries after the Indian cricket board revealed that it is considering a pay hike for domestic cricketers and match officials.

It has been learnt from a top official that BCCI received a few proposals on the revised pay structure with one being submitted by a member associated with the junior selection panel.

Currently, the senior national selection committee members get Rs 60 lakh per season while the junior panel members receive Rs 40 lakh per annum.

This has been the pay structure since 2012 and has not undergone any revision.

“Yes, we have received multiple proposals with regards to revision of pay for national selectors. One of the points raised by a number of people is that chairman of both selection committees should get more than other members as the job profile carries more responsibility,” a BCCI official, who cannot be officially quoted, told PTI on Friday.

In fact, the official informed that one of the proposals stated that chairman of the senior selection committee should be remunerated to the tune of Rs 1.20 crore — exactly double of what they are currently getting.

The BCCI on the otherhand probably will be more keen to give a 30 to 35 percent hike from what it is at present.

“After five seasons when there hasn’t been salary revision, if there is a demand for hike, it is justified,” the official said.

Study says drinking alcohol daily may raise skin cancer risk,"Heavy alcohol consumers may be at an increased risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer. (Representational File Photo) Heavy alcohol consumers may be at an increased risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer. (Representational File Photo)

Individuals who are heavy alcohol consumers may be at an increased risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, an analysis has shown. The findings, published in the British Journal of Dermatology, revealed that for every 10 gram increase in alcohol intake per day, the risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) increased by 7 per cent and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) by 11 per cent. These are the two most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer.

While ultraviolet radiation is directly linked to BCC and cSCC risk, the relationship between alcohol and these cancers is not exactly defined, the study said. For the study, the team conducted meta-analysis and reviewed findings from 13 case-control/cohort studies, which comprised 91,942 BCC cases and 3299 cSCC cases, to determine any link between alcohol intake and non-melanoma skin cancer incidence.

“This meta-analysis found evidence that alcohol drinking is positively associated with both BCC and cSCC risk in a dose-dependent manner,” said H.Yen from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.However, “these results should be interpreted with caution due to potential residual confounding”, Yen added.

Because alcohol drinking is a prevalent and modifiable behaviour, it could serve as an important public health target to reduce the global health burden of non-melanoma skin cancers, the researchers said.

Chinese academic who called Mao a “devil” says he was sacked,"China aims to build world-class universities and some of its top schools fair well in international rankings by various standards. However, critics argue constraints on academic freedom could inhibit those ambitions. China aims to build world-class universities and some of its top schools fair well in international rankings by various standards. However, critics argue constraints on academic freedom could inhibit those ambitions.

A Chinese professor who called the founder of modern China Mao Zedong a “devil” on social media said on Friday he had been sacked by a prominent Beijing university. Mao, who died in 1976, is still officially venerated by the ruling Communist Party as the founder of modern China and his face appears on every yuan banknote. Shi Jiepeng, a classical Chinese assistant professor at Beijing Normal University, said he was fired last month.

Shi “had for a long time made mistaken comments online, which cause a negative impact in society”, according to his dismissal note which has been circulated online, the authenticity of which Shi confirmed to Reuters. The university declined to comment.

Shi had been attacked on leftist websites as unpatriotic for comments on his Weibo microblog in which he not only referred to Mao as a devil but also said China should cast aside Chinese culture and fully accept Western civilisation. “Actually what I said was very moderate, like what Lu Xun wrote but far from as deep,” Shi told Reuters, referring to a man revered as a founder of modern Chinese literature who often wrote scathingly of traditional Chinese culture.

Mao is particularly respected by leftists who believe the country has become too capitalist and unequal over three decades of market-based reforms. While the party has acknowledged Mao made mistakes, there has yet to be an official accounting for the chaos of the Cultural Revolution when Mao declared class war, or the millions of deaths from starvation during the 1958-61 Great Leap Forward, a failed attempt at rapid industrialisation. Crackdowns on what academics and students can say and should think are nothing new in China.

Curriculums and speech at universities, in particular, are tightly controlled by the government, fearful of a repeat of the pro-democracy protests in 1989 that were led by students. In 2013, a liberal Chinese economist who had been an outspoken critic of the party was expelled from the elite Peking University. Asked what he thought of the current state of freedom of expression in China, Shi said: “From the treatment I have received – haha”.

China aims to build world-class universities and some of its top schools fair well in international rankings by various standards. However, critics argue constraints on academic freedom could inhibit those ambitions.

"Venkaiah Naidu elected as Vice President, says now I am a non-party man","Venkaiah Naidu with his wife Usha and daughter Deepa Venkat after he was declared elected on Saturday evening.

SENIOR BJP leader and former Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu was on Saturday elected the 15th Vice-President of India. His election comes a day after the BJP became the single-largest party in the Rajya Sabha, over which he will now preside as its ex-officio chairperson. “I am very humbled. I am also thankful to the Prime Minister and all party leaders for their support. I will seek to utilise the vice-presidential institution to strengthen the hands of the president and secondly uphold the dignity of the Upper House,” Naidu said after his emphatic victory.

Naidu, 68, will be administered the oath of office by President Ram Nath Kovind at a function at Rashtrapati Bhavan on August 11. Naidu replaces Hamid Ansari, who retires on August 10. Within seconds of the election results, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, wishing Naidu a “fruitful and motivating tenure” and saying he was confident Naidu would “serve the nation as a diligent and dedicated vice-president, committed to the goal of nation building”. Later, both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah visited Naidu at his residence to congratulate him.

Naidu won 516 of the total 771 votes polled, in the 786-member electoral college. Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the Opposition’s candidate, got 244 votes, while 11 votes were declared invalid. Two BJP members, Vijay Goel and Sanwarlal Jat, could not cast their votes due to illness while party MP Chedi Paswan had been barred by the Supreme Court from voting.

Naidu got 67 per cent of the total votes in an election that witnessed over 98 per cent polling. A source pointed out that the highest votes ever cast in a vice-presidential election before this was 759, when BJP veteran Shekhawat was elected as the 11th vice-president in 2002. Naidu is the second BJP leader to be vice-president after Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.

Ever since the BJP-led NDA government came to power with a clear majority in 2014, the Rajya Sabha has been dominated by the Opposition. On Friday, the BJP became the single largest party in the Upper House, overtaking the Congress’s 57 by one seat. Though the NDA is not likely to get a majority on its own in the Upper House in the current term of the Modi government, it is expected that the government will have a smoother run.

A BJP leader said that since Naidu is from Andhra Pradesh, his term as Rajya Sabha chairman is expected to help the BJP get the backing of southern parties such as the AIADMK, TRS and YSR Congress during debates and passage of legislation in the Upper House.

It remains to be seen how Naidu, who is known for his puns and one-liners, settles into his new role as Rajya Sabha chairman. On the eve of the vice-presidential election, while launching ‘Tireless Voice Relentless Journey: Key Speeches of M Venkaiah Naidu’, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in a lighter vein that in his new role as Rajya Sabha chairman, it would be a “challenge for him to speak less and let others speak”.

BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Prabhat said he was confident that Naidu would be a “fair chairperson”. “When he sits on the chair, he will be a just and fair person,” Jha told The Sunday Express. The Opposition is watching, said a senior Congress leader. “We will see how Naidu conducts the House. If he takes everyone along, we will cooperate, otherwise the government will face a tough Opposition,” he said.

On Saturday, before the results came out, Naidu assured that he would be bipartisan. “There is no my party or your party. Now I am a non-party man. A majority of political parties in India have supported my candidature,” he said.

US sends official communication to UN stating it wants out of Paris climate deal,"Trump is “open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its business, its workers, its people and its taxpayers,” the department said. (File photo) Trump is “open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its business, its workers, its people and its taxpayers,” the department said. (File photo)

The Trump administration on Friday officially told the United Nations that the U.S. intends to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate pact. But the State Department’s announcement doesn’t formally start the process of the U.S. getting out of the voluntary agreement. That’s still to come. Still, the department described its communication as a “strong message” to the world, following President Donald Trump’s decision in June to leave the accord.

“The State Department is telling that U.N. what the president already told the world on June 1 and it has no legal effect,” said Nigel Purvis, who directed U.S. climate diplomacy during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.

Purvis said countries can’t withdraw from new international agreements, including the Paris climate one, until three years after they go into effect. The Paris agreement went into effect on Nov. 4, 2016. Then the process takes a year. The State Department cited the same timeline, saying it can officially start withdrawing as soon as November 2019. That means the earliest the U.S. can be out of the climate agreement is November 4, 2020 – the day after the next presidential election.

In a statement, the State Department said the U.S. will continue to participate in international meetings and negotiations on current and future climate change deals. The next meeting is in Bonn, Germany, in November. Trump is “open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its business, its workers, its people and its taxpayers,” the department said.

Under the agreement, countries set their own national plans for cutting climate emissions. That means Trump can come up with different targets for the United States than those set by President Barack Obama. But Trump can’t unilaterally change the text of the Paris deal.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric confirmed that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres received “a communication” from U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley “expressing the intention of the United States to exercise its right to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, as soon as it is eligible to do so under the Agreement, unless it identifies suitable terms for reengagement.”

“The secretary-general welcomes any effort to re-engage in the Paris Agreement by the United States,” he said. Dujarric reiterated Guterres’ June 1 statement calling the U.S. decision to withdraw “a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security.”

“It is crucial that the United States remains a leader on climate and sustainable development,” Dujarric said. “Climate change is impacting now. He looks forward to engaging with the American government and all other actors in the United States and around the world to build the sustainable future for our children and future generations.”

Under Obama, the U.S. agreed to reduce polluting emissions more than a quarter from 2005 levels by the year 2025. There is no climate court. All that’s required in the agreement is a plan and reporting on progress toward reaching self-set goals. No matter what the U.S. does, the Paris agreement remains in effect because enough other countries ratified it.

The Paris agreement aims to prevent the Earth from heating up by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since the start of the industrial age. The world has already warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution. The overwhelming majority of scientists say the burning of coal, oil and gas is causing the Earth’s climate to change because of heat-trapping gases.

"India vs Sri Lanka: The ball is spinning but it needs to be seen how things go, says Ajinkya Rahane","Ajinkya Rahane scored 132 runs during India’s first innings of second Test against Sri Lanka in Colombo. (Source: AP) Ajinkya Rahane scored 132 runs during India’s first innings of second Test against Sri Lanka in Colombo. (Source: AP)

India dominated the second day’s play against Sri Lanka in Colombo after R Ashwin scalped two wickets before stumps. Earlier, the visiting side went on to compile 622/9 before making the declaration. At the post-match presser, centurion Ajinkya Rahane, spoke about his innings, how the track is behaving and why third day will play a crucial role.

“Playing sweep shots is high-risk because bounce is variable. Some balls are bouncing while others are keeping low. Playing on this wicket isn’t easy for the batsmen and tomorrow (Saturday) would be key for our bowlers to bowl in right areas,” said Rahane, who scored 132.

Rahane, who had good outing in the ODI series in West Indies, said he wanted to carry that form into the whites and continued with the positive mindset.

“It was important but for me I was confident about myself. I was batting well in West Indies so I wanted to carry that form. So here I decided that if i play positively and play properly I would convert it into a big one,” he said.

“Its all about mindset. Coming into the game knowing it is a spinning track. I was visualising what are the good shots on this wicket. we had to dominate their four spinners,” added Rahane.

There was lot of purchase for the spinners on the second day but Rahane insisted that bowlers need to pitch it in the right areas.

“It wont be easy for our bowlers too, for the bowlers we have to get their eight wickets too. The ball is spinning but it needs to be seen how things go, ” Rahane said.

India have been scoring big in the Tests and the lower-order continues to play the important role for the side. Rahane lauded the contribution from the last four and also praised Sanjay Bangar.

“It will be a different challenge. It’s good to see different batsmen scoring runs and even at the bottom of the players are scoring runs. It is good that last four are contributing and credit for that goes to Sanjay Bangar and Raghu in the nets,” said the Indian batsman.

India have been dominating the opposition with their batting and the same was repeated in the first innings of the second Test.

“We dont look at our opponents. For us it is imp to keep our standards high and give our best all time. I discussed with Virat (Kohli) that we needed 150-200 runs for a stand to push them on backfoot and that what happened with Pujara,” said Rahane.

“We are talking about that we want to dominate. Shikhar (Dhawan) is batting well and (KL) Rahul came in this match. We know that if Shikhar and Rahul continue batting like that the middle order can carry that momentum,” concluded the right-hander.

"R Ashwin picks up 5 wickets, India bowl out Sri Lanka for 183","R Ashwin picked up his 26th five-wicket haul for India. (Source: AP) R Ashwin picked up his 26th five-wicket haul for India. (Source: AP)

Indian spinners did not take much time to inflict danger to Sri Lanka batsmen as R Ashwin picked up his 26th five-wicket haul in Test cricket on the third morning of the Test and bowled out the hosts for a low score of 183 in their first innings. India asked Sri Lanka to follow-on as they took a lead of 439 runs.

Ravindra Jadeja also took two wickets while Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav shared three wickets among themselves in the morning. Shami came as the fourth bowler in the day and he picked up two wickets in the first over itself.

Jadeja began India’s rattling of Sri Lanka when he picked up the wicket of Dinesh Chandimal in the fifth over of the day when the Sri Lanka captain swept but hit it straight to square-leg.

While there were deliveries that bounced, spun and turned square, Niroshan Dickwella was unfazed by all this and the wickets falling at the other end. For a moment, Angelo Mathews and Dickwella were dealing in fours and sixes. The Sri Lanka wicket-keeper completed his half-century off just 44 balls.

But he was out trying the fancy shots. Shami kept it wicket-to-wicket and Dickwella went for a scoop. Shuffling across and completely exposing his stumps, he missed the ball and was bowled. This was on the first ball of the over. On the final, Herath received a fullish delivery that he had no clue about and was bowled.

Dickwella had a 53-run partnership with Mathews but that was not enough for Sri Lanka to save the follow-on. Mathews also took the aggressive approach. He clobbered Ashwin and Jadeja for a six each, picked up boundaries in his 26-run innings. He countered the extreme spin of the spinners with his shot but it was not be for long.

Ashwin got one to turn sharply which Mathews tried to deflect off his pads but that went to the left of Cheteshwar Pujara at leg-slip. He dived and grabbed a stunning one-handed catch inches off the ground.

Dhananjaya de Silva received a dream Jadeja delivery first up which left his in disbelief as he was bowled. This was his second wicket of the day and his 150th in Test cricket.

Once Ashwin picked up the wicket of Dilruwan Perera with a peach of a delivery that turned into him, the players waited to know if Nuwan Pradeep, who had his hamstring pulled while bowling, will come out to bat or not.

An injured Pradeep walked out to bat and after his 12-run stand with Malinda Pushpakumara, he became the final wicket to fall as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 183.

Japan PM Shinzo Abe’s support rebounds after cabinet reshuffle,"Tomomi Inada, an Shinzo Abe protege, stepped down as defence minister last week after a series of gaffes and a cover-up at her ministry.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s support bounced up after a cabinet reshuffle, media polls showed on Friday, a development likely to help tighten his grip on power, shaken by recent scandals and a crushing loss in Tokyo elections. Abe opted for safe hands over fresh faces in Thursday’s cabinet reshuffle after gaffes and missteps by some in his previous cabinet, such as former Defence Minister Tomomi Inada, sent his support ratings tumbling.

Many of those in the new lineup, which Abe dubbed the “result-oriented cabinet of professionals”, were reappointed, such as Finance Minister Taro Aso, or returned to posts held before, including Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera.

A poll by the Mainichi newspaper showed 35 percent of respondents support Abe’s government, up nine points from a month ago, while a Kyodo news agency survey showed a rise in support of 8.6 points from the previous poll, to 44.4 percent.

Abe apologised for recent scandals at the outset of a nationally televised news conference following the reshuffle, bowing his head for about eight seconds, and then reiterated that his top priority is reviving the economy.

Inada, an Abe protege, stepped down as defence minister last week after a series of gaffes and a cover-up at her ministry.

Abe himself has been embroiled in a suspected cronyism scandal, having had to repeatedly deny doing any favours to help a friend win approval for a veterinary school.

Appearing on a television programme on Friday, Abe expressed resolve to work hard to win back the people’s trust.

“What’s been asked of us is to firmly show results,” he added.

Major tasks ahead are putting an end to deflation and working closely with the United States and regional nations to defuse the threat from North Korea’s nuclear and missile development.

Former boxing champion Timothy Bradley announces his retirement,"Timothy Bradley went 33-2-1 with 13 knockouts in his career, Timothy Bradley went 33-2-1 with 13 knockouts in his career,

Former two-division world boxing champion Timothy Bradley is retiring.

Bradley confirmed his decision Saturday night in a statement issued after he commentated on Vasyl Lomachenko’s victory over Miguel Marriaga in downtown Los Angeles.

The 33-year-old Bradley went 33-2-1 with 13 knockouts in his career, winning titles at welterweight and light welterweight. He famously fought Manny Pacquiao three times, beating the Filipino star in a widely disputed decision in 2012 before losing two rematches by decision.

Bradley won a light welterweight title in 2008 and moved up four years later to claim Pacquiao’s welterweight belt. Bradley defended that title in a sensational brawl with Ruslan Provodnikov in 2013, and he beat Juan Manuel Marquez by split decision seven months later.

Bradley hasn’t fought since his second loss to Pacquiao in April 2016.

Bethlehem graffiti lampoons Trump embrace of Israeli wall,"Tourists stand in front of a graffiti depicting US President Donald Trump on the controversial Israeli barrier in the West Bank town of Bethlehem August 4, 2017.

(REUTERS/Mussa Qawasma)

US President Donald Trump’s promised wall along the Mexican border may be a tall order, but at least he has left his mark on the Israeli security barrier that he has promoted as a model. On the concrete barricades erected by Israel around parts of Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank, giant spray-painted images of Trump have given constricted Palestinians some comic relief.

“I’m going to build you a brother,” the US leader tells the wall in one mural. In another, he hugs an Israeli army watch-tower, with heart-shaped emojis added alongside paint splashes and soot stains left by Palestinian demonstrations. The artist, who goes by the alias @LushSux and who Australian media have said comes from Melbourne, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Thursday, the Washington Post published a transcript of a conversation in which Trump pressured Mexico not to publicly oppose his plan to have it pay for a border wall that he says is needed to stop illegal immigration to the United States.

“You know, you look at Israel – Israel has a wall and everyone said do not build a wall, walls do not work — 99.9 percent of people trying to come across that wall cannot get across and more,” Trump told Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, according to the transcript of the phone call in January.

“Bibi Netanyahu told me the wall works,” he added, using Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s nickname. The Bethlehem wall has become a showcase of protest art voicing Palestinians’ fears that Israel’s West Bank fence-and-concrete barrier is a land grab that may deny them a state. Israelis deem the project a bulwark against Palestinian attack.

AIIMS meet on Tuesday to discuss pay for faculty,"AIIMS) administration has called a meeting on Tuesday in connection with revised pay scales for its faculty members.

The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) administration has called a meeting on Tuesday in connection with revised pay scales for its faculty members, a senior AIIMS official said. The meeting comes days after The Indian Express reported that the Union government had questioned the previous hike under the Sixth Central Pay Commission (CPC), and asked if the money paid to the faculty was based on the “UGC scale”.

Senior officials said the administration will discuss the “release of interim relief for its faculty” — a temporary arrangement — before the revised pay scale is finalised by the government. “The competent authority has desired to hold a meeting on Tuesday… at 2 pm… All members are requested to kindly make it convenient to attend the meeting…,” the order said. The meeting will be chaired by Professor Balram Airan, Dean (Academic), and will include other members such as R K Sudhanshu, Deputy Director (Administration), Raj Kumar, Senior Financial Advisor and representative of the Faculty Association of AIIMS.

With 17 faculty members quitting in the last three years — including five in the last six months — AIIMS recommended that the government revise its pay scale and implement the Seventh CPC. A committee set up by AIIMS in February highlighted “unattractive pay” as the reason behind the exits.

"Far behind, Gopalkrishna Gandhi fell 30 short of Opposition hopes too","Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said respective parties will probe why some MPs were absent, while stressing that Gandhi had got more votes than Kumar did during the presidential poll. (Source: Express Photo/Neeraj Priyadarshi) Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said respective parties will probe why some MPs were absent, while stressing that Gandhi had got more votes than Kumar did during the presidential poll. (Source: Express Photo/Neeraj Priyadarshi)

While the Opposition put up a brave face arguing that its joint candidate Gopalkrishna Gandhi got more votes of MPs than its presidential nominee Meira Kumar, a close look at his count of 244 shows he got less votes than expected, suggesting cross-voting. That is not counting the nine opposition MPs, two from the Congress, four from the Trinamool Congress, two from the Indian Union Muslim League and one from the NCP, who did not vote.

The 18 opposition parties which had together fielded Gandhi have 245 MPs in the two Houses of Parliament, and he had also been promised support by the Aam Aadmi Party, which has four Lok Sabha MPs. Besides them, Asaduddin Owaisi of the AIMIM, some Independents and some nominated members were also expected to support the Opposition candidate.

The 18 parties backing Gandhi included the JD(U) (18 MPs), which is now with the BJP. The BJD, with its 28 MPs, had also backed Gandhi. Both the JD(U) and BJD had voted for NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind in the presidential elections. Meira Kumar got 225 votes from among MPs, and if Gandhi got her votes, plus the JD(U) and BJD’s, he should have touched at least 265.

Besides members of parties in the NDA and fence-sitters like the YSRCP, TRS and AIADMK, there are 278 MPs. Gandhi’s loss appears to have been NDA candidate and Vice-President elect M Venkaiah Naidu’s gain. Kovind had got 522 MP votes, including of the BJD and JD(U). Discounting the 40 votes of the two parties, Naidu should have got 482. Even if the 10 nominated members, who are not allowed to vote in the presidential elections, voted for Naidu, he should have gone up to only 492. He got 516 votes instead.

Of the total 785 MPs allowed to vote on Saturday, 771 turned up. Of the 14 MPs who didn’t vote, only three belonged to the NDA camp. Of the remaining 11, nine were opposition MPs and two Independents. Among the Independents missing was Anu Agha, a former member of the Sonia Gandhi-headed National Advisory Council who was nominated to the Rajya Sabha by the UPA, and Kokrajhar MP Naba Kumar Sarania. Eleven of the votes cast were found to be invalid. Polling agents said seven belonged to the Opposition, while four were of the NDA.

The two Muslim League MPs who couldn’t vote, P K Kunhalikutty and Abdul Wahab, blamed national carrier Air India. They could not reach Delhi in time for voting as their flight from Kozhikode was stranded at the Mumbai airport for over three hours due to a technical snag. The flight which was to leave Mumbai around 11.15 am left at 2.34 pm. The MPs reached Parliament 10 minutes after voting closed.

The Congress MPs who did not turn up included Rajya Sabha MP Ranee Narah and Lok Sabha MP from Maldaha Uttar Mausam Noor. Noor told The Sunday Express she had viral fever, while Narah could not be contacted. The four Trinamool Congress MPs who did not vote were Tapas Pal, Pratima Mondal, Abhishek Banerjee and Kunal Kumar Ghosh. Trinamool Congress sources said Mondal, Banerjee (Mamata Banerjee’s nephew) and Pal could not make it on medical grounds.

NCP MP Udayanraje Bhonsale too did not turn up. The BJP members who were absent were Union Sports Minister Vijay Goel and Rajasthan MP Sanwarlal Jat. Both of them are hospitalised. Former Union minister and PMK leader Anbumani Ramdoss was also absent. Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said respective parties will probe why some MPs were absent, while stressing that Gandhi had got more votes than Kumar did during the presidential poll. “It is a matter of happiness that our votes did not come down despite all the efforts by the government.” CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said “if some votes were invalid and if there was any cross-voting… respective parties will look into it”.

Gandhi thanked the MPs who voted for him. “They represent different political persuasions, they come from different parts of India and they had all come together to vote for what they thought was the national good, which is the affirmation of the right to free thought and free speech, the right to hold a different opinion and the duty to serve the cause of pluralism and secularism in India.”

He said he wants to tell all the MPs across the political divide that “you carry a great responsibility and a great weight on your shoulders and may you discharge your responsibilities in the tradition of the great parliamentarians of our country, with diligence and courage”.

“There were two big victories today… First is that of Venkaiah garu… the second victory is of free speech. This is the victory of the ballot. It is also the victory of free speech and the second victory belongs to all the people of India,” he said. He said he was expecting a “handsome performance” by the united vote of the opposition parties and was “more than satisfied with what I have got”.

(Source: Express Archive)

Joshna Chinappa and Dipika Pallikal have assured India of a medal by reaching the women’s doubles semifinals at the WSF World Doubles Squash Championship in Manchester.

After the 2014 Commonwealth Games gold medallists won their quarterfinal on Thursday night, there was double disappointment for India on Friday when both the mixed doubles pairs, involving Joshna and Dipika, went down fighting in the quarterfinals.

In the women’s doubles Joshna and Dipika, the second seeds came, back from a game down to beat the lower seeded Canadians Samantha Cornett and Nikole Todd 10-11, 11-6, 11-8.

The focus will now be on them as they remain India’s only hope in the competition.

They take on the English duo of Jenny Duncalf and Alison Waters in the semifinals to be held later on Friday.

Their win followed a double blow on Friday when the pairs Saurav Ghosal and Dipika, and Vikram Malhotra and Joshna crashed out one after the other in the quarterfinals held concurrently on side by side courts.

The pity was that both these pairs had the chance of emerging winners but lost out in the final stretch of the extended contests.

Second seeds Saurav and Dipika were pitted against the top seeds, Paul Coll and Joelle King of New Zealand.

The contest was close from start and turned closer as it warmed up. After the pairs had traded a game each the Indians had edged ahead in the decider before slipping at the business end. Coll and King won 11-7, 10-11, 11-9.

Similar was the fate of Joshna and Vikram against the Australia’s David Palmer and Rachael Grinham.

The Indians bagged the first game and gave a fair indication of being on song. But as the match wore on, the points ran close. The Australian pair inched ahead in the battle of rallies and as luck would have it Joshna and Vikram gave in. Palmer and Grinham won 8-11, 11-9, 11-9.

"China convicts employees of exiled tycoon Guo Wengui, including niece","FILE PHOTO: Paramilitary policeman in front of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, March 9, 2016. (Source: Reuters, file) FILE PHOTO: Paramilitary policeman in front of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, March 9, 2016. (Source: Reuters, file)

A Chinese court on Friday convicted three employees of fugitive billionaire Guo Wengui, who has been locked in a high-stakes political feud with the ruling Communist Party, including the businessman’s niece. The Kaifeng Intermediate People’s Court, in central Henan province, also fined Henan Yuda, a real estate company owned by Guo, 150 million yuan ($22.32 million) for fraudulently obtaining loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars from China Guangfa Bank, Zhongyuan Bank, Industrial Bank and others.

Two of the employees, Zhang Xincheng and the niece, Guo Lijie, were jailed for two years and 18 months respectively, while the third, Xiao Yanling, was found guilty but exempted from criminal penalty, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. Guo’s sentence was suspended for two years. In a trial held last month, the three had admitted to falsifying contracts with fake shell companies at Guo’s direction to fraudulently obtain loans totalling 1.495 billion yuan.

Guo, who now lives in New York having left China in 2014, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. “This is entirely a case of fabricating evidence (against me) to make false charges,” he said in an online video blog on Thursday. The case mirrors that of a trial in the northeastern city of Dalian involving another of Guo’s companies and is the latest legal salvo in a sustained Chinese government effort to discredit and tighten pressure on Guo.

Guo has emerged as a political threat to the Chinese government in a sensitive year after unleashing a deluge of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials through Twitter posts and video blogs. The businessman has made clear that he wants to disrupt a key five-yearly congress to be held this autumn.

Guo’s online claims have also seen him sued for defamation in New York by conglomerate HNA Group, property developer SOHO China, journalist Hu Shuli and Chinese housing vice-minister Huang Yan. Guo is the subject of an Interpol global “red notice” issued at Beijing’s request in April.

China Guangfa Bank declined to comment. Zhongyuan Bank and Industrial Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ($1=6.7 yuan)

International Olympics Committee defend stance on Russian doping,"Sebastian Coe confirmed that 19 Russian athletes were in London to compete at the World Championships. (Source: Reuters) Sebastian Coe confirmed that 19 Russian athletes were in London to compete at the World Championships. (Source: Reuters)

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) today defended its stance on Russia despite being criticised for baulking at calls to ban the country outright from last year’s Rio Olympics over doping.

Russia was accused in a World Anti-Doping Agency report last year of widespread state-sponsored doping. Its athletics team was barred by the IAAF from the Rio Games and will also miss the IAAF World Championships that get under way later Friday.

But there was no blanket ban for Russia in Rio, the IOC coming under fire for instead allowing individual sports federations to decide which Russian athletes could compete.

IOC president Thomas Bach insisted that the IAAF was a special case, outlining the “collusive cooperation” Russian elements had enjoyed with the disgraced former IAAF president Lamine Diack and other corrupt people at the heart of track and field.

Russia “was discussed, it was raised”, Bach told a press conference in London alongside current IAAF president Sebastian Coe, who initiated the ban on Russia and resultant reforms within global track and field’s governing body.

“It was very clear that, as we have always said, different issues need different approaches,” the German said.

“The IAAF is in fact the only international federation, international sports organisation, which is, due to facts relating to the former leadership of the IAAF, implicated in the report of Professor McLaren as is the national federation of athletics of Russia,” he said in reference to the Canadian co-author of the bombshell report into the state-sponsored doping.

“This is the difference to all other international federations.

“Professor McLaren made it always very clear that there is no other, neither national federation nor international federation, about which he would have similar information of such a collusive cooperation with regard to the fight against doping.

“In this respect, the IAAF was in a special situation and addressed it then with special measures.” Bach added: “It was a courageous decision at the time and it is a courageous decision to follow it through.

“The IOC accepted and supported these measures from the very beginning.”

IAAF head Coe said he had informed Bach of Russia’s “important step” Thursday when Dmitry Shlyakhtin, head of the Russian athletics federation (RusAF), publicly apologised for the doping scandal.

“I expressed my comfort that the new head of RusAF was prepared to acknowledge the turbulence that they had had to deal with it and the way in which they were gripping that return,” the Briton said.

“An international federation can only respond to the circumstances that it confronts. You can’t benchmark your responses against what other federations may be doing because you’re not comparing like for like.

“This was the roadmap we thought was the best roadmap for normalising the situation,” he said of the Rune Andersen- headed Taskforce set up by IAAF to oversee the return of

Russia to international competition. “There are still some milemarks to meet but we are making progress.

“The object is to make sure that when those (Russian) athletes do return to international competition… under normal circumstances, representative of their nation, then they do so in a way that’s not remotely jeopardising the ambitions of clean athletes wherever they happen to be.”

A number of Russian athletes, however, have been granted permission by the IAAF to compete as neutrals after meeting the exceptional eligibility criteria, essentially demonstrating that they’ve come through transparent anti- doping testing.

Coe has confirmed that 19 Russian athletes were in London to compete at the worlds.

But the country remains excluded as a whole after the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of the Council’s decision to maintain the ban on RusAF.

Taskforce chief Andersen insists that the timeline of a Russian return to international action in November was still possible.

"Post-1947, the mixed fortunes of the mixed race Anglo-Indians","An Anglo-Indian gathering. (source: Poorvi Singhania, Wikimedia Commons). An Anglo-Indian gathering. (source: Poorvi Singhania, Wikimedia Commons).

“Who am I? ..is a question that I have found more difficult to answer than any other in my life,” says Margaret White, an Anglo-Indian culinary consultant who lives in Bengaluru and gives weekly classes at her home for reviving the Anglo Indian cuisine, something which she feels is a responsibility on her part. Margaret’s ancestors were supervisors in the Kolar Gold Fields, a mining region in Karnataka, and she grew up with rich tales of life in the Colonial era and how things changed post Independence.

When the British finally packed their bags to leave India for good, White says her family was also struck with insecurity. However, they didn’t leave the country due to a sense of endearment they had developed with their birthplace. It was only after a couple of years that the community found some promise by the constitutional safeguards provided by the founding fathers.

The Indian Constitution recognises Anglo Indians as a citizen of mixed Indian and European descent (paternal side). Between the 18th and 20th centuries, the term described Britons in India. But the term was formalised in the Census 1911. Anglo Indians were for the first time officially recognised as a specific community by the British. The Government of India Act, 1935 identified Anglo Indians as “a person whose father or any of whose other male progenitors in the male line is or was of European descent but who is a native of India.”

The Constitutional Assembly kept the operating part and the community was listed as a minority in the Indian Constitution in 1950. Now, the community is largely urban, traces roots to early contact between Europe and India, as back as 1498 during the time the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama came on Indian shores for the first time. The government of India estimates the community to be around 1,00,000-1,50,000.

Anglo Indians can trace their origins as back as 1498 when Vasco da Gama came on Indian shores for the first time.

In post-independence India, a generation of Anglo Indians left Indian shores against the advice of their community leaders writes Alison Blunt in Domicile and Diaspora:Anglo-Indian Women and the Spatial Politics of Home.

Robyn Andrews, after speaking to migrant Anglo Indians in UK, Canada and Australia, concluded in his study Quitting India: The Culture of Migration that the reasons migration varied from search for employment, insecurity and one group even said it was a glamorous thing to do.

His study theorised that “fears of reprisals and insecurity about their future in India led to three major waves of migration from the sub-continent”. The first wave of migration came just after 1947. The second wave was in the early sixties during the time there was a push for Hindi to be made the national language which reduced chances of employment. The third wave came in the 1970s and is called by most sociologists as the ‘family reunion wave’.

Anglo-Indian leader Frank Anthony wrote in Britain’s Betrayal in India: Story of the Anglo Indian Community, “At the time of Independence there were estimated to be 200,000–300,000 Anglo-Indians in India… after over fifty years of steady exodus from India the population of Anglo-Indians in India is estimated to be less than half that number now.”

Independent India was as new to Anglo-Indians as was to other citizens, but brought with it an invidious situation for the community. British historian Arnold J Toynbee says survival was the prime challenge and response for the Anglo Indians. The challenges, he theorised, were from the early masters and later internally from the Indian counterparts.

“We were considered inferior by the Europeans due to our mixed descent and not accepted by our fellow Indians due to the colour of our skin, language, customs, upbringing etc. Europeans looked down upon us with equal resentment as they did other Indians. However, we faced the mistrust of Indians. Most of it was on account of our aloofness as a community. That was helped by our “European culture and looks,” says Noel Clarke, part of RootsWeb archive group that is helping people trace their ancestry.

Clarke’s family has been in India for nine generations and at least five members of his family have served the British Army. The identity dilemma is not overbearing anymore. “But it has come after we have developed a genuine community consciousness. That has been initiated by the community itself and not with outside help.”

The community was born with Europeans trying to create an indigenous support group, thus encouraging officers and civil servants to marry Indian women. One pagola or gold mohar was the reward provided for each child born out of such a marriage. In the initial days, the children were accepted promptly and got jobs in the East India Company. Several travelled to England for studies and schools came up in places like Madras, Bangalore and Lucknow for Anglo Indians. Their culture and propensity was in line with the Europeans. By the 1800s, the situation changed for the Anglo Indians. The British were averse to strengthening a parallel ethnic group in the country and discouraged all measures allowing the same. The newly framed policies tried to exclude them from the British societal setup and top echelons of the industry.

“It showed how the community was treated as second class Europeans. Low level positions in the government and company were offered to Anglo Indians, the ínferior jobs or dirtier jobs as my grandparents told me,” said Clarke.

Madras-born Anglo Indian author Moira Breen, one of the most vocal members of the community, wrote in the book Anglo Indians: The Way We Are: “We considered ourselves domiciled Europeans and 100% British”. However, the community has integrated well since the independence.

For “Anglo Indians: Vanishing Remnants of a Bygone Era”, US-based Blair R Williams conducted a decade long study and found that intermarriage trends picked up since the 1940s. The study finds that Anglo Indian-Anglo Indian/European marriages dropped from 94% in 1940s to 46% in 1990. It also found that Anglo Indian women marrying non Anglo Indian men increased from 3% in 1940s to 29.5% in 1990s and Anglo Indian men marrying non Anglo Indian women increased from 3% in 1940s to 24.5% in 1990s. This can also be seen in line with the fact that the population of the community has also reduced.

Post independence, Anglo-Indians continued to have reservations in civil and military jobs. However, the Anglo-Indians faced a host of problems too.

(Photo: Karan Kapoor) Photographer Karan Kapoor grew interested in the subject, partly thanks to his own life, as a child of an Anglo-Indian marriage. (Photo: Karan Kapoor)

Crum Ewing and Willem Adriaan Veenhoven observed in their exhaustive analysis “Case Studies on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: A World Survey” that post independence, though the Anglo Indians enjoyed reservations in civil and military jobs, they faced a host of problems. The writers concluded that in the early years of independence, they were disinclined to accept inferior jobs. The larger lack of academic qualification and keeping away from learning Indian native languages became a hurdle. Occupational specialisation was something the community at large did not possess in the early years of independence.

The All Indian Anglo-Indians Association estimated most of the community is based in cities of Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Mumbai, Kochi, Goa, Secunderabad, Tiruchirapalli, Chennai and Kanpur. Some pockets are strong even in Visakhapatnam, Agra, and towns in Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal.

The community has been, like all other minorities, promised rights and benefits. However, proper representation of the community in Parliament is something that it cries out for and has strived for since Independence. The most celebrated leader Frank Anthony was nominated for seven terms in the Lok Sabha between 1952 and 1996. However, the inability to articulate the issues of the community in the Lok Sabha have been evident. The community has tried to push an Anglo Indian Welfare Bill but it has been stonewalled. The latest attempt was done by Professor Richard Hay in Lok Sabha, 2016. It is yet to be discussed.

"Thomas Pieters leads way, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy close behind","Thomas Pieters grab the first-round lead. (Source: Reuters) Thomas Pieters grab the first-round lead. (Source: Reuters)

A sharp short game and hot putter helped Thomas Pieters grab the first-round lead as headliners Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy lurked close behind at the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational on Thursday.

The 25-year-old Pieters by his own admission was terrible off the tee, hitting only four fairways, but he finished in style by sinking a 30-foot birdie putt for a bogey-free five-under-par 65 at Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio. He led by one stroke from Scotsman Russell Knox, who bogeyed the last.

“I only had two putts from above the hole. The others were pretty straightforward putts,” Pieters said after heading the select 76-player field in his first competitive round on the course.

“I was pretty terrible from the tee, but managed to hit a lot of greens. Kind of a stress-free round.”

Spieth, showing no signs of a let-down following his British Open triumph two weeks ago at Royal Birkdale, was two shots off the pace along with four-times major winner McIlroy, playing alongside new caddie Harry Diamond.

The Northern Irishman split with his caddie of nine years, J.P. Fitzgerald, following the British Open.

“It was good. A little weird at the start,” McIlroy said about the new partnership with best friend Diamond. “Obviously, it’s been nine years since I’ve had anyone else on my bag.”

Short-game master Spieth wielded his magic putter to sink consecutive monster birdies late in his round, before ending his day with a sand save at the last, holing a seven-footer for par.

“I really scrambled nicely, and made a couple of really long putts back-to-back in the middle of the round that put us at three (under) when I felt like I played a one or two-under round,” said Spieth, winner of his last two events.

Joining Spieth and McIlroy on 67 were double Masters winner Bubba Watson, Englishman Ross Fisher, Spaniard Jon Rahm and American Kevin Kisner in a round that was played two hours earlier than originally planned to avoid threatening thunderstorms in the forecast.

Another shot away was world number one Dustin Johnson, who bombed a 439-yard drive on his way to a birdie at the downhill par-five 16th hole.

Knox vaulted up the leaderboard boosted by an eagle at the par-five second, his 11th hole, when his 76-yard pitch shot trickled back into the cup.

“I hit a poor drive and just laid up,” he said. “I was able to judge the distance right and it kind of rolled up to the top of the hill and trickled back and went in. Obviously, it was a huge bonus to make eagle.”

"Tripura rebel TMC MLAs meet Amit Shah, all set to join BJP on Sunday","The TMC legislators, along with some other Trinamool members, will join the BJP in Agartala on Monday. (File Photo) The TMC legislators, along with some other Trinamool members, will join the BJP in Agartala on Monday. (File Photo)

Five of the six Trinamool Congress legislators from Tripura, who had openly defied party chief Mamata Banerjee’s directives and voted for the NDA candidate in the Presidential election last month, on Saturday met BJP president Amit Shah in New Delhi and confirmed they would join his party without any precondition. The TMC legislators were accompanied by senior Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in his capacity as convenor of BJP’s North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) when they went to meet Shah, with Sarma later tweeting that the Tripura MLAs had “expressed desire to join party unconditionally”.

The TMC legislators, along with some other Trinamool members, will join the BJP in Agartala on Monday. Union Minister of State for Petroleum Dharmendra Pradhan, BJP general secretary Ram Madhav and Sarma will attend the event. The legislators — Sudip Roy Barman, Asish Saha, Pranjit Singha Roy, Diba Chandra Hrankhawal and Biswa Bandhu Sen — were also accompanied by Tripura BJP president Biplab Kumar Deb and Tripura TMC youth wing president Sushanta Choudhury, apart from Sunil Deodhar, BJP’s ‘prabhari’ for Tripura. The BJP is also organising a tribal rally in Agartala on August 9, which will be attended among others by Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu.

This will be the first tribal rally to be organised by the BJP in Tripura, where a tribal body had last week demanded creation of a separate state for tribals of the state.

Wayde Van Niekerk qualifies in 400 meters at World Championships,"Wayde Van Niekerk during the men’s 400m heats at World Championships. (Source: Reuters) Wayde Van Niekerk during the men’s 400m heats at World Championships. (Source: Reuters)

It was almost vintage Usain Bolt.

Slow start, work your way up, and at the end look left and right before coasting first across the line in a jog.

This time it was Wayde van Niekerk winning his opening heat in the 400 meters on Saturday, his first race of possibly six in as many days at the world championships. The Olympic champion crossed in 45.27 seconds, .26 ahead of Nery Brenes of Costa Rica.

Like Bolt, a rival setting off faster no longer phases him. Van Niekerk just made sure he produced some extra power on the final straight to rein in Brenes.

Van Niekerk is seeking to win gold in both the 400 and 200 meters over the next week. He is tipped by many to become the sport’s next star now that Bolt is retiring after the world championships.

In both races, though, he might find his toughest rival in Isaac Makwala of Botswana. Makwala was just as good in his heat. Following a fast start, it was a jog in the finishing straight as he finished in 44.55 for the top time of the day.

The two are equally tight competitors in the 200, too, yet there is no bitterness in their rivalry.

“Wayde van Niekerk is my brother,” Makwala said. “We want to conquer the world together and make the final for Africa. He is so friendly and a lovely guy.”

The pair dominated the morning session at the Olympic Stadium, but by dusk, all eyes will be on Bolt as he tries to bow out with a last individual gold in the 100 meters.

Other finals on Saturday are the men’s discus and long jump, and the women’s 10,000.

The two-day heptathlon also started and after two events Olympic champion Nafi Thiam took the lead. She scaled 1.95 meters in the high jump to reach a total of 2,215 points.

In a battle of 22-year-olds, Yorgelis Rodriguez matched Thiam in the high jump with an incredible 8-centimeter improvement of her personal best to keep in touch in the overall standings with 2,207 points. Caroline Schafer of Germany was third with 2,165.

One of Thiam’s toughest rivals, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, only cleared 1.80 in the high jump, well short of her best of 1.98, to dent her gold-medal hopes. She was in fifth position with 2,053 points.

In the women’s 100, all the favorites advanced to the semifinals despite a downpour that affected many of the runners.

Twenty-year-old Gina Luckenkemper of Germany, who raced before the rain came, had the top time of 10.95 seconds. She was the only woman to break the 11-second mark.

Olympic champion Elaine Thompson of Jamaica easily won her heat in 11.05, while Dafne Schippers of the Netherlands had more of a struggle finishing second to Marie-Josee Ta Lou of Ivory Coast. Ta Lou had the second-best time of 11.00.

Tori Bowie of the United States got the worst of the rain but still looked very strong as she took her heat in 11.05.

The semifinals and final are set for Sunday.

In men’s shot put qualifying, Tomas Walsh had a massive throw of 22.14 meters, which the IAAF said was the second biggest in the 34-year history of the event. The championship record is 22.23 meters, set by Werner Guenthor in 1987.

Joining Walsh in Sunday’s final with a first automatic qualifying mark were Olympic champion Ryan Crouser and two-time world champion David Storl of Germany.

Lack of professionalism for not sending my name for Arjuna award: Rohan Bopanna hits out at AITA,"AITA had announced in June that it would be recommending Bopanna for the award. (Source: File) AITA had announced in June that it would be recommending Bopanna for the award. (Source: File)

Ace Indian tennis player Rohan Bopanna has hit out at the All India Tennis Association for not being able to nominate him for the Arjuna Awards this year. Slamming AITA, the 37-year-old blamed the tennis association for its ‘lack of professionalism’ and not sending his nomination on time.

It may be recalled here that AITA had announced in June that it would be recommending Bopanna for the award but only Saketh Myneni features on the list of awardees. This prompted Bopanna to take to social media and vent his anger on the course of events.

In a letter to the AITA, which was revealed in a post on Twitter, Bopanna wrote, “Arjuna Award is one of the prestigious awards a sportsman receives in our country. It is not just the honour that it carries in receiving it but it’s also an acknowledgement.

“A humble response to the hours, days and years an athlete puts into their craft to keep excelling while keeping their grit unbroken. It is recognition to an athlete’s patience and perseverance as they make it against all odds.

He also congratulated Saketh Myeni and wrote, “I want to take this platform to congratulate Saketh Myneni on receiving this award. I couldn’t be more proud as I have seen him grow into the player and the man he is today.

When are we going to change. #WakeUp pic.twitter.com/RPGCtKaxgG — Rohan Bopanna (@rohanbopanna) 5 August 2017

“We professional tennis players put in a lot to bring laurels to our country. And no one could question otherwise. However, it is when the system (the Tennis Association in this case) functions sloppily that is not only disrespectful but also robs one of the hope of a deserving acknowledgement.

Slamming the AITA, he said, “I am calling out to the lack of professionalism and efficiency by AITA for not sending my nomination for the Arjuna Award before the deadline. I have witnessed many such excuses for the past decade (while I was eligible and my record didn’t falter) and then too, have never stood for it.

“AITA gained a lot of traffic in the media for claiming they would be nominating me for the Arjuna Award this year and for it to not materialize due to the disorder in the ‘Order’ makes me question this so much more.

“Especially since the criteria to be nominated apart from a deserving and consistent performance is also that more than one tennis player can be nominated for the esteemed Award.”, Bopanna concluded.

Brazilian forward, Neymar has made an emotional farewell video for fans and teammates of his erstwhile club Barcelona. In a long message on social media, he also explained as to why he decided the Spanish club and seek a new challenge in his career.

Stating that challenges motivate him as an athlete, Neymar said, “The life of an athlete is moved by challenges. Some are imposed, others are the result of our decisions.”

Speaking about his former club, he said, “Barcelona has been more than a challenge. Played with them in the video game. I arrived in Catalonia at 21, full of challenges. I remember my first days in the Club, sharing the costumes with idols like Messi, Valdés, Xavi, Iniesta, Puyol, Piqué, Busquets and others with the expectation of playing in a Club that is “more than a club”. @fcbarcelona is a nation that represents Catalonia!” “I had the

"Andy Murray, Marin Cilic pull out of Rogers Cup with injuries","Andy Murray, three times a winner of the Rogers Cup, will miss the event for the second straight year as he continues to deal with a troublesome hip. Andy Murray, three times a winner of the Rogers Cup, will miss the event for the second straight year as he continues to deal with a troublesome hip.

World number one Andy Murray and big-hitting Croatian Marin Cilic withdrew from the Rogers Cup on Thursday as injuries continued to take a toll on the Canadian hardcourt event.

The withdrawal of Murray, the world’s top-ranked player and number six Cilic comes on the heels of U.S. Open champion and world number three Stan Wawrinka announcing he would not be in Montreal due to a knee injury. Murray, three times a winner of the Rogers Cup, will miss the event for the second straight year as he continues to deal with a troublesome hip.

“I am sad to be missing the tournament in Montreal because I have many great memories from my time in Canada. I am doing everything I can to return as quickly as possible” said Murray in a statement released by Tennis Canada. Cilic ruled himself out with an abductor injury he says he suffered in the Wimbledon final against Roger Federer.

Vatican urges Venezuela’s Maduro to suspend new legislative superbody,"FILE PHOTO: Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro talks to the media during a news conference at Miraflores Palace in Caracas, Venezuela, June 22, 2017.

The Vatican called on Friday for Venezuela’s government to suspend its new legislative superbody and made a direct appeal to the security forces to avoid excessive force in dealing with opposition protests. Current initiatives including the constituent assembly “create a climate of tension and conflict and take the future for granted”, the Holy See Secretariat of State said in a statement, calling for the changes to be prevented or suspended.

The spiritual home of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics also urged Venezuela’s security forces to avoid “excessive and disproportionate use of force”. More than 120 people have died in four months of opposition protests. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has defended the newly minted superbody, created as a result of a vote on Sunday, and which countries around the world have criticized as a bid to indefinitely extend his rule.

The Vatican statement called for a negotiated solution following the same guidelines the Vatican set out last year when it brokered talks between the government and the opposition which later broke down. It also called on Venezuela to respect human rights and the country’s current constitution.

Mergers of small banks may hurt MSME sector: Report,"MSME sector, which provides bulk of employment, accounts for 45 per cent of India’s manufacturing, 40 per cent of exports and nearly 8 per cent of the country’s GDP. MSME sector, which provides bulk of employment, accounts for 45 per cent of India’s manufacturing, 40 per cent of exports and nearly 8 per cent of the country’s GDP.

Mergers of small banks may hurt credit sourcing for the MSME sector as the resultant large lenders will be less keen on smaller-sized loans, said a report from financial services firm Resurgent India. “The disadvantages of big banks are that services are less personable and local people abstain from reaching out to them. There are more fees associated with bigger banks. And, bigger banks are less motivated to work with MSMEs on loans due to smaller business accounts,” it said.

Mergers of smaller banks into big will hurt credit sourcing for MSMEs, as smaller banks will be losing their identity, Resurgent India Managing Director Jyoti Prakash Gadia.

At least six Buddhists killed in rising Rakhine violence,"FILE PHOTO: A boy sit in a burnt area after fire destroyed shelters at a camp for internally displaced Rohingya Muslims in the western Rakhine State near Sittwe, Myanmar May 3, 2016.

Suspected insurgents killed at least six members of a Buddhist ethnic minority in western Myanmar on Thursday, the government and regional sources said, amid spiralling violence in troubled Rakhine state. Security forces discovered the bodies of three men and three women bearing machete and gunshot wounds in the Mayu mountain range near the town of Maungdaw, the office of Myanmar’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said.

In a statement, it said “extremists” were responsible for killing the six members of the Mro minority from the village of Kaigyi whom residents believe to have stumbled upon a camp for Rohingya Muslim militants. Muslim-majority Northern Rakhine was plunged into violence last October when Rohingya insurgents killed nine police in coordinated attacks on border guard posts.

In the ensuing military operation, security forces allegedly shot villagers at random, raped Rohingya women and burned down houses. United Nations investigators who interviewed some of the nearly 75,000 people who fled to neighbouring Bangladesh said troops probably committed crimes against humanity. Suu Kyi is refusing to cooperate with a U.N. fact-finding mission set up to look into abuses in Rakhine and elsewhere.

The government accuses the militants of running training camps in the mountains and killing alleged informants in the Muslim community.

Security forces had begun an “intensive clearance operation” to hunt the killers on Thursday, a military officer in Rakhine said.

Two women aged 21 and 34 were still missing from the group that ventured into the hills to tend to farms, said the officer, who sought anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Aung Kyaw Min, a Buddhist resident of Kaigyi, said villagers believed the two women had also been killed because some of their bloody clothing was recovered.

“We are all suffering from this killing,” he said. “All the villagers are in panic and nobody wants to live there. They all want to move to a safe place arranged by the government.” Non-Muslim ethic groups recognised as Myanmar citizens are the minority in northern Rakhine. About 1.1 million Rohingya live in the state, but are denied citizenship. Many in Myanmar consider them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Tension among the communities has been running high in recent weeks, say aid workers and U.N. officials there.

In the town of Rathedaung, south of Maungdaw, troops launched a separate hunt for alleged militants, said the military officer and a human rights monitor with regional sources. Security forces on Friday opened fire on villagers armed with sticks around the hamlet of Auk Nan Yar, the monitor and a resident said. Four non-Muslim villagers went missing in the area last week and the mutilated bodies of three Muslims were discovered on Monday.

Liverpool’s Adam Lallana out injured for a couple of months: Jurgen Klopp,"Liverpool’s next Premier League campaign begins from August 12. (Source: AP) Liverpool’s next Premier League campaign begins from August 12. (Source: AP)

Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana could be out of action for a couple of months after suffering a thigh injury, manager Juergen Klopp said on Friday. The 29-year-old England international was hurt during Liverpool’s pre-season loss to Atletico Madrid on penalties in Munich on Wednesday.

“This is certainly not news we would have wanted,” Klopp told the club website (www.liverpoolfc.com).

“Unfortunately, the damage is such that it will likely mean Adam is out for a couple of months not weeks, so I think we can pretty much rule him out of August and September. “Beyond that we will monitor and wait and see. He is a boy with a world-class attitude to everything professionally and he has always come back in good time from injury setbacks since I have been here.”

Lallana joined Liverpool from Southampton in July 2014 and scored eight league goals last season.

He will now miss the start of Liverpool’s next Premier League campaign, which begins at Watford on Aug. 12, three days before the first leg of their Champions League playoff against Hoffenheim.

He will also be a major doubt for England’s next two World Cup qualifiers, against Malta and Slovakia in September.

Prosecutors: South Korean director investigated in abuse case,"South Korean film director Kim Ki Duk. (Files) South Korean film director Kim Ki Duk. (Files)

South Korean prosecutors are investigating award-winning film director Kim Ki duk after an actress accused him of hitting her and trying to force her into shooting off script sexual scenes while making a 2013 movie. An official from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office on Thursday said the director will be questioned but it hasn’t been determined when.

He spoke on condition of anonymity because of office rules. Ahn Byung ho of the Federation of Korea Movie Workers’ Union said the actress dropped out from the filming of because of Kim’s alleged abuse and recently reported the case to the union after suffering from “psychological pain” for years. The movie, “Moebius,” a dark and violent story about an estranged family, was released in 2013 after Kim finished filming with a different actress.

Kim and his production company did not answer repeated calls for comment. The Dong A Ilbo newspaper reported that Kim told a reporter he had slapped the actress while instructing her acting, but he denied trying to force her into filming off script scenes. Kim won the top prize in the Venice Film Festival with his 2012 film “Pieta,” a brutal mother and son tale of revenge and redemption.

While his movies often garner critical acclaim, many moviegoers, especially women, consider them to be disturbing because of excessive violence and depictions of rape and castration.

Champions League absence may help Arsenal,"Arsenal will be competing in the UEFA Europa League but will surely be tempted to give their younger players that stage to prove their worth. (Source: Reuters) Arsenal will be competing in the UEFA Europa League but will surely be tempted to give their younger players that stage to prove their worth. (Source: Reuters)

Despite winning a third FA Cup in four years last season, there remains an air of unease around Arsenal heading into the new Premier League campaign.

Even their usual dominance in north London has been turned on its head, with rivals Tottenham finishing above them last season for the first time in 22 years.

Arsenal fans were split on whether Arsene Wenger deserved a new two-year contract with the club in May, with the FA Cup final triumph over Chelsea the clincher.

But though many fans will lament the absence of Champions League football this season for the first time in two decades, recent history indicates it may be the break they need to mount their most serious title challenge since they last lifted the trophy in 2004.

The previous two English champions, Leicester and Chelsea, were unburdened by the pressure of European football.

Arsenal will be competing in the UEFA Europa League but will surely be tempted to give their younger players that stage to prove their worth.

In China last week, chief executive Ivan Gazidis spoke about how Arsenal were committed to letting their youngsters flourish.

“At Arsenal we’re very much driven by our values, like giving young people a chance,” he said.

Rest and recuperation for first team regulars will be important too, especially given Arsenal’s frequent injury issues, particularly hamstring strains.

Arsenal will have five of their rivals slugging it out on the continent for the top prize in European football thanks to Manchester United’s qualification via their Europa League win.

Perhaps, helped by canny acquisitions such as French forward Alexandre Lacazette and Bosnian left-back Sead Kolasinac, Arsenal can steal a march on their rivals.

Wenger proved last season, particularly in the 2-1 victory over Antonio Conte’s side in the FA Cup final in May, that he is still a master tactician. Knowledge such as his does not simply evaporate and if he is heading into his final years at the club, he is not the type to leave meekly.

However, whether or not Arsenal will be in the title reckoning come next May could depend on what happens in the next few weeks.

Despite repeated assurances from Wenger that Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez will be staying, the duo have still not signed new contracts.

Their current deals expire next year, which Wenger called an ideal situation.

Sanchez has been linked with a move to Manchester City and would be the bigger miss in a potential title challenge.

The Chilean scored 24 goals in the league last season, and provided 11 assists. He also attempted the most shots in the whole team, with 129. The next best was Theo Walcott with 62.

Were Sanchez to leave, it would undoubtedly be for a hefty sum which could help secure the services Monaco’s young attacker Thomas Lemar who has been linked with a move to the Emirates.

One season out of the Champions League may be too much for 28-year-old Sanchez. However, the rest of the squad, with their average age of 26, may find it is the ideal time to upset the odds.

Oxford English Dictionary adds over 600 expressions,"Over 50 new words and 30 new senses related to tennis were added (Source: File photo) Over 50 new words and 30 new senses related to tennis were added (Source: File photo)

The Oxford English Dictionary has added over 600 new words, phrases and senses in its latest quarterly update. “By the mid-20th century, ‘woke’ had been extended figuratively to refer to being ‘aware’ or ‘well informed’ in a political or cultural sense,” the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) said in a statement.

The use of “woke” by supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement — an international activist movement that campaigns against violence and racism toward black people — and in particular the phrase “stay woke”, are thought to have introduced the word to a broader audience, especially on social media, Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday.

“Post-truth” was the Oxford’s 2016 word of the year. It was defined as “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping political debate or public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”.

Besides, over 50 new words and 30 new senses related to tennis were added. “Tennis mom” and “tennis dad”, for example, are now used to describe parents who actively and enthusiastically support their child’s participation in the sport.

The dictionary has also got a new end. “Zyzzyva”, a tropical weevil native to South America, is the new last in place of “zythum”, a kind of malt beer brewed in ancient Egypt, which was the last alphabetic entry for a decade.

Meanwhile, the word “thing” now has a new sense defined as “a genuine or established phenomenon or practice used in questions conveying surprise or incredulity, such as ‘how can that be a thing?’,” said the OED, adding that the usage has been traced back to an early episode of television series “The West Wing”.

In explanation of how a word qualifies for take-in, the OED said it “requires several independent examples of the word being used, and also evidence that the word has been in use for a reasonable amount of time.”

The OED will publish its next update in September.

Happy Friendship Day: Viewers not only ape the style and mannerisms of TV characters today, but also connect with them as real people.

Indian television has become an integral part of our lives today. From the vicious saas, the crying bahu to that hottie we have our eyes on, every character has a special place in our hearts. Viewers not only ape the style and mannerisms of TV characters today, but also connect with them as real people. It’s thus no more surprising to see a discussion revolving around Ishita-Raman’s marital life or how Maya is making life difficult for Arjun. On the occasion of Friendship Day, we decided to list out five popular TV characters that we would love to have as a friend.

Ishita (Divyanka Tripathi) from Yeh Hai Mohabbatein:

Who doesn’t like a friend who has all the luxuries of life? Having Abhi the rock star as your friend will not only uplift your social status but also get you many perks.

Are you the one who talks less? Have a mundane life? Well, then send a friend request to Diya now. Young and chirpy, Diya is a friend with whom you can talk the whole day and never get bored. She can also be your perfect guide if you ever decide to go to Rajasthan. And if you have kids, well, then she can be the solution to all your crisis. She is not only the ‘pari’ (fairy) that young kids dream of but also a pehredaar (protector), whom you can trust your children with. Isn’t that a fascinating combination?

Advay Singh Raizada (Barun Sobti) from Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon 3:

If you are a girl and already crushing on Advay, become friends and hang out with him. Who knows when cupid strikes? And if you are a boy, well, having Advay in your circle could get girls swarming around you guys. If you are lucky, a couple of beauties could fall for you too (wink wink). Apart from these important reasons, Advay is a professor of Mathematics, so you will no more fail your dreaded maths paper. Also, being a musician, your parties will never be boring again. So Advay, humse dosti karoge?

Saumya (Rubina Dilaik) from Shakti:

Saumya can truly be a wonderful friend. She can teach you to be content in life with whatever we have. Saumya takes life head on. A forgiving person and one who loves her family unconditionally, being with her can make you a better human being. Yes, Saumya might be a trouble magnet but what’s life without some adventure?

Happy Friendship Day guys!!!

Trump touts new sanctions on North Korea,"Trump wrote on Twitter: “The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!” (AP Photo) Trump wrote on Twitter: “The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!” (AP Photo)

President Donald Trump has touted new sanctions the UN Security Council approved for North Korea, saying they will have a “very big financial impact.” The Security Council unanimously approved the sanctions on North Korea, including banning coal and other exports worth over USD 1 billion. The US-drafted measure, negotiated with North Korea’s neighbour and ally China, is aimed at increasing economic pressure on Pyongyang to return to negotiations on its nuclear and missile programs.

Trump wrote on Twitter: “The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!”

Trump’s national security adviser, HR McMaster, stressed in an interview that aired earlier in the day that it is “impossible to overstate the danger” posed by North Korea. In an interview with MSNBC’s Hugh Hewitt that aired Saturday, McMaster said Trump has been “deeply briefed” on the strategy on North Korea. Tensions have mounted with Pyongyang’s two recent successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles.

McMaster reiterated the administration’s position that all options, including a targeted military strike, are on the table. Still, he acknowledged this “would be a very costly war, in terms of in terms of the suffering of mainly the South Korean people.”

McMaster continued: “So what we have to do is everything we can to to pressure this regime, to pressure Kim Jong Un and those around him such that they conclude it is in their interest to denuclearise.” The comments came as Secretary of State Rex Tiller son was in the Philippines for a regional summit expected to focus heavily on concerns with North Korea. Tillerson has no plans to sit down with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho at the event.

Tillerson’s reluctance to sit down with his North Korean counterpart is despite his growing push for Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table with the US. Tillerson said this week that such talks would have to be predicated on the North giving up its nuclear weapons aspirations and that the conditions for such talks haven’t yet been met by North Korea’s government.

Haiti Senate votes to ban gay marriage,"“We see this as an attack on the LGBT community in this country,” said Charlot Jeudy, president of the Kouraj group, which defends the rights of homosexuals and transgender people.(Representational image) “We see this as an attack on the LGBT community in this country,” said Charlot Jeudy, president of the Kouraj group, which defends the rights of homosexuals and transgender people.(Representational image)

A vote by the Haitian Senate to ban gay marriage as well as “public demonstration of support” for homosexuality reflects the will of the people, the chamber’s president has said. The Senate approved a bill late Tuesday that said “the parties, co-parties and accomplices” of a homosexual marriage can be punished by three years in prison and a fine of about USD 8,000.

“All senators are opposed to same-sex marriage, so this simply reflects the commitments the senators made during their campaigns,” Senate President Youri Latortue told AFP. Haiti’s constitution established a secular republic but the country is marked by deep religious beliefs. “Although the state is secular, it is people of faith who are the majority,” Latortue said, stressing the commonly held belief in Haiti that homosexuality is a Western practice only.

“A country has to focus on its values and traditions. Some people in other countries see it differently, but in Haiti, that’s how it’s seen.” Haitian law already defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, making it unclear what consequences the bill, if passed, would have in practice.

However, it also called for banning “any public demonstration of support for homosexuality and proselytizing in favour of such acts.” It is this ambiguous wording that raises concern among Haitian homosexuals and their advocates.

“We see this as an attack on the LGBT community in this country,” said Charlot Jeudy, president of the Kouraj group, which defends the rights of homosexuals and transgender people.

“This text divides our society, it reinforces prejudices and discrimination. It’s really a shame.” The two gay rights organisations still officially recognised by the state record daily instances of insults, threats and violence. Politicians “know very well that this will bring much more violence and prejudice against the LGBTI community,” Jeudy said.

Only police and the judicial system can intervene in response to reported violations under the measure. The bill now goes to the Chamber of Deputies for debate, though its passage into law is all but certain.

He also urged the football fans across India to come and cheer for the first Indian team that will play a FIFA tournament.

Ceppi delivered a fresh update on the readiness of the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium that will be the first to see Indians rise for the national anthem at a FIFA tournament.

“There’s a lot of work happened at the stadium, some great work. The stadium is 90-95 per cent ready. The fans need to be more enthusiastic, the ticket sales have definitely boomed, but by the standard we have seen in Kolkata, Guwahati and Kochi, we expect a bigger boom,” said Ceppi.

India, which is making its debut in a FIFA tournament as a participant as well as the host, will face the United States of America in their opening game and will go on to play Colombia and Ghana in the 58,000-seater stadium in the country’s Capital.

The Local Organising Committee is leaving no stone unturned to make the tournament a grand success with nation- wide promotional events lined up in the upcoming two months.

Speaking about it, Project Director of the LOC, Joy Bhattacharjya said, “This is the time you will see the LOC as well as all our stakeholders engaging in massive promotional campaigns.

US President Donald Trump set to embark on a 17-day vacation,"Trump is due to set out tomorrow on his first extended vacation from Washington since the inauguration, a 17-day getaway to his private golf club in central New Jersey. (File – AP Photo) Trump is due to set out tomorrow on his first extended vacation from Washington since the inauguration, a 17-day getaway to his private golf club in central New Jersey. (File – AP Photo)

Donald Trump once questioned the wisdom of taking vacations. “What’s the point?” he asked. But now the president is getting ready to join the annual August exodus from this town he calls “the swamp.” Trump is due to set out tomorrow on his first extended vacation from Washington since the inauguration, a 17-day getaway to his private golf club in central New Jersey.

The president’s vacation could be driven, in part, by necessity. Everyone who works in the White House West Wing, including the Oval Office occupant himself, will be forced to clear out by week’s end so that the government can replace the balky, 27-year-old heating and cooling system.

But the White House hasn’t been entertaining questions about the president’s August plans. Asked whether Trump would be leaving Washington this month, given his recent warning that Congress should stick around until they vote on health care legislation, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday: “We’ll continue to keep you guys updated on his August schedule as those details are finalized.”

Trump and his supporters like to tout his disdain for taking vacations, when the truth is he takes them constantly. “Don’t take vacations. What’s the point? If you’re not enjoying your work, you’re in the wrong job,” Trump wrote in his 2004 book, “Trump: Think Like a Billionaire.”

He told Larry King in an interview that year that “most of the people I know that are successful really don’t take vacations. Their business is their vacation. I rarely leave. You know that,” Trump said. “You and I are friends. How often do you see me going away?”

Actually, Trump gets out of town quite often. So far, he has spent 13 of his 28 weekends in office away from the White House, mostly at his properties in Palm Beach, Florida, or in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to an Associated Press count. The figures include a weekend during official travel overseas, and Father’s Day weekend at Camp David, the government-owned presidential retreat in Maryland.

Contrast Trump’s own frequent getaways with his criticism, before and during last year’s presidential campaign, of former President Barack Obama’s vacations and frequent golf outings.

“Barack Obama played golf yesterday. Now he heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha’s Vineyard. Nice work ethic,” Trump tweeted in August 2011.

Trump said last year that he wouldn’t have time for golf if he became president. “I’m going to be working for you, I’m not going to have time to go play golf,” he told supporters in Virginia. But he plays golf whenever he’s at his clubs; sometimes it’s the full 18 holes, other times less than that. His staff rarely acknowledges that he plays, even when photos of him on the course pop up on social media.

Presidents have been escaping Washington’s summer heat and humidity ever since Thomas Jefferson looked out of the White House windows and watched as a white fog that was believed to be toxic rolled in. Harry Truman played poker on the porch in Key West, Florida. Ronald Reagan rode horses at his mountain ranch in California.

Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both spent August vacations on Martha’s Vineyard, the tiny Massachusetts island that serves as a summer playground for the rich and famous. George W Bush retreated to his secluded Crawford, Texas, ranch to clear brush and ride his mountain bike.

Besides the replacement of the West Wing’s heating and cooling system, repairs are also to be made to the steps on the South Portico, the side of the White House facing the National Mall. Cosmetic upgrades, including interior painting, replacing carpeting and curtains and fixing water leaks in the press office ceiling, are also on the maintenance list.

Repairmen and others are expected to work around the clock during the coming weeks to complete all the upgrades by August 21. Presidents travel with the equivalent of a mini-White House made up of advisers, other aides and security, and they must be prepared to deal with a crisis at all hours and from wherever they are.

But chronic stress affects the body’s ability to resist infection, maintain vital functions and avoid injuries, Susan Krauss Whitbourne, then a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, wrote in a 2010 paper on the website of Psychology Today subtitled “why presidents (and all of us) need vacations.”

Stressed out people are more likely to get sick, have accidents, sleep poorly, be more irritable and less fun to be around. Whitebourne wrote that vacations break the “stress cycle.”

“Perhaps it’s good that someone as important as our president is showing that he believes it’s beneficial to take a break from the office, get out and enjoy the outdoors in a little bit of a break in mindset and, we would hope, be able to go back to work refreshed and renewed and do a better job,” Whitbourne, who currently teaches at the university’s Boston campus, told the AP in a telephone interview. “I think that’s the theory of vacations.”

The German government has accused Vietnamese intelligence services of involvement in what it called the kidnapping in Berlin of a former Vietnamese oil executive, and gave the country’s intelligence attache 48 hours to leave Germany.

Trinh Xuan Thanh, 51, disappeared in July last year after he was accused of mismanagement at a subsidiary of national oil and gas giant PetroVietnam, resulting in losses of some $150 million. Vietnamese police issued an arrest warrant in September.

This week, Vietnamese authorities said he turned himself in to police in his homeland on Monday.

German authorities, however, believe that he was kidnapped in Berlin on July 23. They say that he had sought asylum in Germany an application that hadn’t yet been processed and that Vietnamese authorities had sought his extradition.

“There is no longer any serious doubt about the participation of the Vietnamese intelligence services and the embassy … in the kidnapping of a Vietnamese citizen in Berlin,” German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer told reporters.

The kidnapping, he added, “is an unprecedented and flagrant violation of German and international law” and “has the potential to negatively influence relations in a massive way.”

Vietnam’s ambassador was summoned to the foreign ministry on Tuesday and was told that Germany demanded that Thanh be returned so that the asylum and extradition proceedings could be conducted properly. Schaefer said that German and Vietnamese officials had met on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit on July 7-8 to discuss Hanoi’s wish to have Thanh extradited.

Germany is declaring the intelligence attache at Vietnam’s embassy persona non grata and demanding that he leave within 48 hours, Schaefer said.

“We reserve the right to draw further consequences if necessary at a political, economic and development policy level,” he added.

Berlin prosecutors said they couldn’t comment on the case beyond confirming that there is an investigation. Calls to the Vietnamese embassy in Berlin were not answered.

Thanh was chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013 when he was appointed to several senior government positions, including vice chairman of Hau Giang province in the southern Mekong Delta.

He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was dismissed from the communist-dominated legislature before its first session the following month.

The ruling Communist Party and government have stepped up their anti-corruption drive over the past few years.

Russia’s ex-ambassador to US rejects accusations of meddling,"President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 Summit. (Source: AP) President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 Summit. (Source: AP)

The former Russian ambassador to the US has strongly denied the accusations of meddling in the US presidential election.

Sergei Kislyak, who has just returned from Washington, said Saturday on Russian state TV that he was merely doing his job as a diplomat when he met with members of President Donald Trump’s team.

He said he also had met with representatives of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, but didn’t give any names.

Kislyak described the US accusations against him as absurd and “shameful” for the US, adding that the official acknowledgement that his phone conversations were bugged was “unhealthy.”

Kislyak’s contacts with members of Trump’s team have been part of congressional and FBI investigations into possible collusion between Trump campaign and Russia.

Russia has denied any interference in the US election.

The people of Darjeeling will voice for their independence on August 15, with the slogan ‘Bengal — Darjeeling Choro (Bengal — quit Darjeeling),’ Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) chief Bimal Gurung said on Saturday.

As the indefinite strike entered 52nd day, Gurung gave the call, saying, “Just as the British exploited us and tortured us, the West Bengal government is also doing the same with the people of the hills, Terai and Dooars. Therefore, when we participate in the Independence day celebrations, we will not only be celebrating our glorious freedom struggle, but will also be protesting against the Bengal’s colonial rule,” Gurung added.

Meanwhile, the CID arrested GJM leader Norbu Lama last night who is a close associate of Gurung, for his alleged involvement in arson and violence that took place last month. “He (Lama) was arrested from the Bhaktinagar police station area last night,” a senior CID official said.

Earlier in the day, the morcha activists rallied in various parts of the hills demanding restoration of Internet services, which have been suspended since June 18, and an immediate withdrawal of police personnel from the hills.

Top intelligence director Ezra Cohen-Watnick fired amid White House shake-up,"U.S. President Donald Trump, right, with National Security Adviser H R McMaster. (File Photo) U.S. President Donald Trump, right, with National Security Adviser H R McMaster. (File Photo)

Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a top intelligence director and a national security aid to the US President Donald Trump has become the latest person to be fired amid an ongoing shake-up at the White House. A White House statement yesterday said, “General McMaster appreciates the good work accomplished in the NSC’s Intelligence directorate under Ezra Cohen’s leadership. He has determined that, at this time, a different set of experiences is best-suited to carrying that work forward.”

Trump’s national security adviser H R McMaster moved to replace Cohen-Watnick when the concerns were raised in March, but Cohen-Watnick appealed to Trump’s top advisers, Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, who got Trump to intervene to save his job.

“General McMaster is confident that Ezra will make many further significant contributions to national security in another position in the administration,” a White House official said, without giving any further details as to what the new assignment of Cohen-Watnick is going to be.

Cohen-Watnick was part of the Trump Transition team and he joined the National Security Council of the White House along with Trump’s first National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who left the administration in the first few weeks.

According to CNN, Cohen-Watnick, along with White House national security lawyer Michael Ellis, are believed to be the two individuals involved in assisting GOP Congressman Devin Nunes in gathering the intelligence materials. Nunes is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

The White House did not give any reason for Cohen-Watnick being fired.

26-year-old diagnosed with ‘binge watching addiction’,"A 26-year old marketing executive, who came to a hospital complaining of “depression and anxiety”, has been diagnosed with an “addiction of online binge watching”. (Representational Image) A 26-year old marketing executive, who came to a hospital complaining of “depression and anxiety”, has been diagnosed with an “addiction of online binge watching”. (Representational Image)

A 26-year old marketing executive, who came to a hospital complaining of “depression and anxiety”, has been diagnosed with an “addiction of online binge watching”. According to the consultant psychiatrist who looked into his case, the man, who works in Gurgaon, had linked his symptoms to stress at the workplace and “interpersonal issues”. But the underlying problem was found to be something else.

“He wanted to watch entire documentaries online in one go, during normal sleep hours. A single documentary is two-three hours long. For two years, he kept binge-watching shows, which led to sleep deprivation. He didn’t realise that this addiction resulted in him suffering from critical symptoms of depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety. He thought it was due to work stress and interpersonal issues,” said Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital.

While there is little empirical research on the impact binge watching has on mental health, reported cases in the capital have been exceedingly rare. “Just like internet or mobile addiction, addiction caused by binge watching is still not defined in the clinical diagnostic manual. But it is a lifestyle related addiction, which, like in this case, can result in critical symptoms of depression and anxiety,” he said.

Dr Jain said that when the man came in for a consultation, he complained that he was unable to go to work. “At first, he showed signs of severe anxiety. During consultation, he was also found to be suffering from stress. His mother said he spent a lot of time on the internet at odd hours. Due to inadequate sleep and binge watching, he was unable to wake up in the morning. He started experiencing anxiety and mind absenteeism and was unable to go to work,” he said.

Dr Jain said that the man travelled 60-80 km to work and worked a nine-hour shift. “Despite his hectic schedule, he could not let go off his habit. This was a clear sign that he was addicted to it. He never realised that sleep deprivation had resulted in anger outbursts, anxiety, mood swings and depression,” he said.

Dr Jain added that correctly “identifying” technology-related addiction is the key to treatment: “In this case, it was binge watching. The man had become irritable and withdrawn and would not take part in family activities. His family, too, did not know this was a consequence of binge watching. He has now undergone psychotherapy for his addiction.”

"Vice-Presidential Election saw two victories- one for Naidu, one for free speech: Gopalkrisha Gandhi","Gopalkrishna Gandhi said the Vice-Presidential election saw two victories, one for Venkaiah Naidu and another for free speech. (Express Photo/Anil Sharma/File) Gopalkrishna Gandhi said the Vice-Presidential election saw two victories, one for Venkaiah Naidu and another for free speech. (Express Photo/Anil Sharma/File)

Opposition candidate and former West Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi on Saturday congratulated Vice-President elect Venkaiah Naidu for being elected to the post and wished him the best for the new office. Speaking to the media after the results were declared, he thanked all MPs from the Opposition parties for voting for him. “I thank those who voted for me. I was expecting a handsome performance by the united vote of Opposition parties and I’m more than satisfied,” he said. “The election saw two victories — one of Naidu, another of free speech; the second victory belongs to all the people of India,” he added.

Former union minister and NDA’s pick Venkaiah Naidu defeated Gopalkrishna Gandhi after securing over two-thirds of the votes cast in the election. Naidu won 516 votes while Gandhi received only 244. The elections, which saw 771 MPs from both Houses of Parliament exercising their franchise, recorded a polling percentage of 98.21.

Taking to Twitter after the results were announced, Naidu expressed gratitude to all those who supported his candidature. “I promise to uphold the Constitution and high standards set by my esteemed predecessors. It’s an honour for me to become Vice-President from a family of an ordinary farmer. This Speaks for the beauty and strength of our democracy,” he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who called on Naidu on Saturday evening and felicitated him at his residence in New Delhi, said he is confident that Naidu will serve the nation as a diligent and dedicated Vice-President, committed to the goal of nation building.

Naidu, who is India’s 13th Vice-President, will succeed Hamid Ansari after his tenure ends on August 10.

Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp expects angry players as competition intensifies,"Liverpool open their league campaign against Watford on Aug. 12. (Source: AP) Liverpool open their league campaign against Watford on Aug. 12. (Source: AP)

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp expects to be dealing with some angry players next season as he makes hard selection decisions amid increased competition for places.

The Merseyside club have held on to their key players from last season, including Brazilian Philippe Coutinho, and have bolstered their squad with the addition of winger Mohamed Salah, defender Andy Robertson and striker Dominic Solanke.

Competition is likely to be particularly rife in attack where Roberto Firmino, Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi will all be competing for the central striker’s role.

As the battle for regular starting spots intensifies, Klopp has urged excluded players to remain confident and fight for their place.

“We want to build on the same base as last year. I’m not in any doubt about that. Everybody thought:

‘He’s going, he’s going, he’s going’ but so far nobody is going,” Klopp told British media.

“If we stay together like this there will be a few hard decisions because they can’t start all together. Then we have to see how this works.

“Be angry at me no problem but stay confident. That is important. Three days later there is another game so be there again. There will be a lot of challenges.”

Klopp, whose side were drawn against German outfit Hoffenheim on Friday for their Champions League playoff, says that the club’s new signings will push players to raise their game.

“The plan is that they all make the next step,” Klopp said.

“I said we always want to develop this team and there are two things to do – signings and training so we did both.

“The signings are nice, either they play or they push another player. Now it’s more difficult to play all the time.”

Liverpool open their league campaign against Watford on Aug. 12 and will face the first leg of their playoff against Hoffenheim on either Aug. 15 or 16.

UN reports hundreds of civilians slain in Congo’s Kasai,"“Survivors have spoken of hearing the screams of people being burned alive, of seeing loved ones chased and cut down, of themselves fleeing in terror”, said the United Nations human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein “Survivors have spoken of hearing the screams of people being burned alive, of seeing loved ones chased and cut down, of themselves fleeing in terror”, said the United Nations human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein

The UN on Friday detailed more than 250 “extrajudicial or targeted killings” of civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Kasai region from mid-March to mid-June, counting dozens of children among those massacred. The findings, based on interviews with 96 refugees from the conflict-hit Kasai who had fled to Angola, blamed state agents for the murders of seven children.

The refugees gave harrowing accounts of the violence in the central region, which the UN warned had taken on “an increasing and disturbing ethnic dimension.” Victims recounted mutilations, including of a seven-year-old boy whose fingers were cut off, and an attack on a hospital in the village of Cinq where 90 people were killed, some because they were too injured to escape a raging fire.

Aside from government troops, the UN blamed a reportedly state-backed militia called the Bana Mura as well as the anti-government Kamuina Nsapu militia for a range of atrocities.

“Survivors have spoken of hearing the screams of people being burned alive, of seeing loved ones chased and cut down, of themselves fleeing in terror”, the United Nations human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said in a statement.

A team of investigators has confirmed 251 executions between March 12 and June 19, the UN report said. “These included 62 children, of which 30 were aged under eight”.

Regarding the children murdered, the UN explained that seven were killed by members of the army (FARDC) or the national intelligence service, while six died at the hands of the rebel group Kamuina Nsapu.

The Bana Mura militia members were blamed for the deaths of 49 minors. Scott Campbell, the head of the western and central Africa division at the rights office, said the new UN report was merely “a snapshot” of the wider conflict and atrocities had likely continued over the past six weeks.

The violence in the Kasai region “could amount to crimes against humanity”, Campbell added, underscoring growing concern that the conflict was “tipping towards to ethnic cleansing”.

The Kasai conflict erupted last September after the death in clashes of a tribal chieftain, known as the Kamwina Nsapu, who rebelled against the authority of President Joseph Kabila’s regime in Kinshasa and its local representatives.

The killing sparked violence that has escalated, including gross alleged violations such as rapes, torture and the use of child soldiers.

The UN said the Bana Mura militia largely included members of the Tshokwe, Pende and Tetela ethnic groups, while the Luba and Lulua communities were seen as supporting the anti-government Kamuina Nsapu.

In less than a year, the violence has claimed more than 3,300 lives, according to a tally by the influential Roman Catholic Church, and displaced 1.4 million people.

Around 80 mass graves have been uncovered in the region.

The president’s mandate expired last December but under a transition deal, he was allowed to remain in office until elections that are supposed to be held in late 2017.

Kabila has so far failed to set a date for the polls, heightening tensions across the country.

The UN rights chief has blasted Kabila’s government for not mounting serious investigations into the Kasai crisis.

He successfully lobbied the Human Rights Council to set up an international investigation, although it is not clear if Congolese authorities will grant the probe access to the Kasai region.

US issues ban on tourist travel to North Korea,"Strict warnings against travel to the North were already in place before the ban was first announced last month following the death of American student Otto Warmbier. (File) Strict warnings against travel to the North were already in place before the ban was first announced last month following the death of American student Otto Warmbier. (File)

The United States has issued a ban prohibiting its citizens traveling to North Korea, a move triggered by the death of a US student imprisoned by Pyongyang during a tourist visit. The ban, which comes into effect September 1, was introduced after officials said the “serious risk” of arrest by Pyongyang officials during tourist travel presented an “imminent danger to the physical safety” of its citizens.

“All United States passports are declared invalid for travel to, in, or through the DPRK unless specially validated for such travel,” read the restriction in the US government’s Federal Register, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name.

Strict warnings against travel to the North were already in place before the ban was first announced last month following the death of American student Otto Warmbier.

Warmbier, 22, a student at the University of Virginia, died in June after being held by Pyongyang for more than a year on charges of stealing a propaganda poster from a North Korean hotel. He had been sentenced to 15 years’ hard labour in the North, but was sent home in a mysterious coma in June and died soon afterwards.

US President Donald Trump slammed Warmbier’s detention and eventual death as “a total disgrace,” pledging to “prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency”.

The new ban will remain in effect for one year, unless it is revoked sooner by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Exemptions will be allowed in specific cases for humanitarian travel and journalists. Tour companies said the ban would significantly reduce the numbers of Western tourists to the impoverished country. “Currently US citizens make up about 20 percent of the Western tourist market, so it will reduce the industry by at least that much — plus the collateral damage of others who may not want to go as a result of this,” said Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, the market leader in Western tourism to North Korea.

Some 5,000 Western tourists visit the North each year, with standard one-week trips costing about $2,000. The vast majority of tourists visiting North Korea are Chinese. Han Chol-Su, a senior North Korea development official, earlier denied that the loss of business would hurt his country’s economy. “If the US government says Americans cannot come to this country, we don’t care a bit,” he told AFP in Pyongyang last month.

North Korean state media “relentlessly presents Americans in the most negative manner; rapacious, war-mongering, and utterly filled with hatred of the Korean people,” Cockerell said.

Describing American visitors as “one of the best soft-power assets of the United States”, he added that the ban would eliminate a counterweight to that propaganda.

In Pyongyang, visiting US tourist Carolyn Dunlap described the move as “definitely not unexpected” in light of Warmbier’s death and other detentions. “Honestly the current travel advice is not much different from a ban, the only difference is people can still physically go,” she told AFP last week.

She planned her trip before speculation of the move mounted, but its timing means she will be one of the last US tourists to the country for at least one year.

"GST council’s 20th meeting: Rate on textile job works, tractor parts lowered","Finance Minister Arun Jaitley along with Minister of State for Finance, Santosh Kumar Gangwar and the Revenue Secretary, Hasmukh Adhia during the 20th meeting of the GST Council, in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI Photo) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley along with Minister of State for Finance, Santosh Kumar Gangwar and the Revenue Secretary, Hasmukh Adhia during the 20th meeting of the GST Council, in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI Photo)

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council in its 20th meeting on Saturday decided to cut the tax rate for job work for the entire value chain of textiles sector to 5 per cent along with reduction in rate for tractor parts to 18 per cent from 28 per cent. Also, the Council gave in-principle approval to the e-way bill rules, which envisage a technology-driven tracking of movement of goods worth more than Rs 50,000 and for sale beyond 10 km in distance. The e-way bill rules are likely to come into force from October 1.

“Ek bada vishaye tha job works ka textiles pe. Consensus ye bana ki throughout the textile chain jisme keval textile hi nai, apparels, shawls, carpet jitne bhi textile related items hai unn sabb pe job work ka rate 5 per cent hi rahega (One big issue was tax rate for job work in textiles sector. A consensus was evolved that the GST rate for job work throughout the textile chain and even for textile-related items such as apparels, shawls, carpets will be 5 per cent),” finance minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after the meeting.

Earlier, the GST for job works related to textile yarns, other than manmade fibres and textile fabrics, was 5 per cent, while for manmade fibres, it was 18 per cent. The move assumes significance as the rollout of GST from July 1 had met with several protests from the textiles sector that had demanded a cut in the tax rate on fabrics, which were brought in the tax net for the first time at the rate of 5 per cent.

The GST rate for government work contracts, for both central and state governments, was also cut to 12 per cent with input tax credit from the earlier decided rate of 18 per cent, Jaitley said. Under the proposed e-way bill rules, the exempted goods under GST will be kept outside its purview. The permits thus issued would be valid for one day for movement of goods for 100 km and in same proportion for following days. As per the draft provision, GSTN would generate e-way bills that will be valid for 1-20 days, depending on distance to be travelled — one day for 100 km, 3 days (100 to less than 300 km), 5 days (300-less than 500 km), 10 days (500-less than 1,000 km) and 20 days (more than 1,000 km). “E-way bill system will be implemented across the country. There will be no checkposts. The process will be technology-driven and human intervention would be minimised. It will be reviewed going forward,” Jaitley said.

Opposing the Council’s decision, Delhi’s finance minister Manish Sisodia said that the issue was against the “fundamental concept” of GST. On Twitter, he wrote, “Have opposed idea of e-way bill in GST meeting today. It’s against the fundamental concept of GST.” In another tweet, he added, “Why we need e-way bill? GST was brought on ‘One Nation – One Tax – One Market’? We have to come out of ‘Inspector Raj’ mindset.”

The Council also gave in-principle approval to anti-profiteering measures and proposal to set up a Screening Committee in 15 days to see if tax reductions after implementation of GST have been passed on to consumers. Jaitley appealed to businesses to pass on the benefit of the reduced tax under the GST to consumers, failing which the anti-profiteering mechanism will be triggered.

“The market mechanism should compel that they give benefit of input credit,” Jaitley said, hoping that there would be “minimal” use of anti profiteering provision and the provision should itself act as a deterrent.

The Council also decided to exempt import of goods and services related to FIFA Under-17 World Cup, which will be hosted by India. For agriculture services, tax rate of post-harvest and storage has been brought down to 12 per cent from 18 per cent. Also, tax rate for entry into planetariums has been reduced to 18 per cent from 28 per cent. In case of “rent a cab service”, GST rate will be 12 per cent without input tax credit and 5 per cent with input tax credit, Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said.

Besides, the norms for reverse charge mechanism have been tweaked to include aggregators who are offering small housekeeping services like plumbing or others with the liability to pay tax on them instead of service provider such as a plumber. Also, cab aggregators will have to pay 12 per cent GST if they claim input credit and 5 per cent without input credit.

On the registrations under GST, the Union finance minister said that more than 71 lakh central and state taxpayers have migrated to the GST system and another 15.67 lakh new applications for registration have been received. The Council will meet next on September 9 in Hyderabad, where it will take up the issue of many rice millers deregistering their brands to escape taxation under the GST.

As per the GST rates, unbranded food items are exempted, whereas branded and packed food items attract 5 per cent rate.

FBI: Explosive detonated at Minnesota mosque,"Law enforcement officials investigate an explosion at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minn., on Saturday. Authorities say the explosion damaged one room but it didn’t hurt anyone. ( AP) Law enforcement officials investigate an explosion at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minn., on Saturday. Authorities say the explosion damaged one room but it didn’t hurt anyone. ( AP)

The FBI was searching for suspects Saturday after an explosive device detonated at a suburban Minneapolis mosque as people were preparing for morning prayers, damaging a room but not causing any injuries, authorities and witnesses said.

The blast happened at around 5 a.m. at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, according to Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts. Windows of the imam’s office were shattered, either by the blast or by an object thrown through them, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported .

One worshipper saw a pickup truck speeding away shortly after the explosion, said Mohamed Omar, the center’s executive director. He said the mosque, which primarily serves people from the area’s large Somali community, occasionally receives threatening calls and emails.

“We came to this country for the same reason everyone else came here: freedom to worship,” Yasir Abdalrahman, a worshipper at the mosque, told the newspaper. “And that freedom is under threat. Every other American should be insulted by this.” Asad Zaman, director of the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, described the attack as a firebombing.

Richard Thornton, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Minneapolis Division, said during an afternoon news conference that the investigation will determine whether the incident was a hate crime and who may have been behind it.

Thornton said the explosion was caused by an “improvised explosive device,” and that investigators have recovered components of the device to figure out how it was put together. But he didn’t take questions during the news conference and declined to provide details about the device, citing the ongoing investigation, which is being led by the FBI.

Saturday’s bombing comes amid a rise in reports of anti-Muslim incidents in the U.S., including arson attacks and vandalism at mosques, harassment of women wearing Muslim head coverings and bullying of Muslim schoolchildren. Just recently in Minnesota, an Islamic cemetery in Castle Rock Township reported it had been vandalized with spray painted profanities and swastikas.

The mosque in Bloomington, just south of Minneapolis, serves as a religious center and community organizing platform for Muslim activists and leaders in the area, according to the society. The group is offering a $10,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest or conviction.

A $10,000 reward also is being offered by the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR. The group said its national office is urging Islamic centers and mosques to step up security. “If a bias motive is proven, this attack would represent another in a long list of hate incidents targeting Islamic institutions nationwide in recent months,” said Amir Malik, the local chapter’s civil rights director.

Along with a mosque, the building houses a community center that hosts computer classes, a basketball league, religious classes, lectures and other events.

Minnesota is home to the largest Somali community in the U.S., roughly 57,000 people, according to the latest census figures. The immigrants have been coming to Minnesota from their war-torn homeland since the 1990s, drawn by generous social services and the sense of community among the diaspora.

UP MLA’s secretary held for cheating Mumbai policeman,"The accused are being interrogated, the police said. (Representational image) The accused are being interrogated, the police said. (Representational image)

Several months after being booked for cheating a policeman with the promise of acquiring a home in Mumbai, the secretary of a Samajwadi Party MLA from Uttar Pradesh was arrested by the police. The Juhu police arrested Anju Almedia on August 2 after assistant police inspector Suryakant Salvi registered a case of cheating and forgery against the MLA and Almedia in February.

The police said that the duo had duped Salvi by making him purchase a room in a slum in Chakala, Andheri East for Rs 23 lakh, claiming that it would be redeveloped by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority. According to the police, the duo posed as builders contracted to convert the slums into an apartment building and gave Salvi forged documents of the sale.

However, after taking the money from Salvi, the duo allegedly stopped communicating with Salvi, leaving him in the dark about his investment. The police said that Almedia has been remanded to police custody until August 8. The MLA is yet to be arrested.

"Kerala political violence: Arun Jaitley visits family of murdered RSS activist, CPI (M) workers stage protest","Arun Jaitley meets the family members of murdered RSS activist Rajesh. (Source: ANI) Arun Jaitley meets the family members of murdered RSS activist Rajesh. (Source: ANI)

A week after the murder of RSS activist Rajesh Edvakode, Union Minister Arun Jaitley visited his house and met his family members in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday. The Union Minister is also scheduled to meet the houses of BJP ward councilors, which were allegedly attacked by CPI (M) workers in the past few days.

Addressing a gathering in the city, Jaitley said: “Visited the family of our deceased karyakarta Rajesh, who was slaughtered in the most barbaric manner. This kind of violence will neither suppress ideology in Kerala nor it will be able to scare our workers. It will only increase their determination to work harder against those who are perpetuating this operation.”

Jaitley’s one-day visit to Kerala comes in the backdrop of increasing incidents of political violence between CPI (M) and BJP-RSS activists that had rocked the state last week. The tension was further aggravated after RSS activist Rajesh was brutally hacked to death. The BJP had alleged that CPI (M) activists were behind the murder, a charge that was vehemently denied by the ruling party.

Shri @arunjaitley visits family of slain RSS worker Rajesh Edavakode in Thiruvananthapuram. #BJPLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/8v3EJwb8Ca — BJP (@BJP4India) August 6, 2017

Ahead of the Union Minister’s visit to the state, CPI (M) members and their families staged protests outside the Raj Bhavan over the increasing number of attacks on the party workers. Accusing him of ‘selective concern,’ the relatives of 21 persons, killed in political attacks over a period of time, began a ‘Satyagarha’ and demanded that the Finance Minister should pay them a visit too. A K Remya, President of Eranholi Grama panchayat in Kannur had written a letter to Jaitley asking him to visit his husband who is undergoing treatment since the past one month following an attack allegedly by RSS cadres.

Annavoor Nagappan, Thiruvananthapuram District Secretary of CPI(M), which is organising the demonstration said the RSS and the BJP were indulging in “false propaganda” that the Marxist party heading the ruling LDF was indulging in violence. He had also written an open letter to Jaitley on the alleged ‘double standards’ of the BJP on the issue of attacks and denied any involvement in Rajesh’s murder.

Post Rajesh’s murder, Rajnath Singh had called Chief Minister Pinnarayi Vijayan and voiced concerns over the law and order situation in the state. Governor P Sathasivam had summoned Vijayan and the state police chief to take stock of the situation. Later, the top brass of the ruling party and the BJP-RSS met on Saturday to discuss the measures to promote peace in the state. Both parties decided that within the next ten days they will instruct all their party cadres and supporters not to involve themselves in any violent activity.

Arun Jaitley’s visit also coincides with the all party meeting called by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday to ease out the political tensions in the state.

"Chandigarh ‘stalking’ case: They blocked my way, tried to open door of my car, says daughter of IAS officer","The vehicle used by him to ‘chase’ the woman. (Source: Express Photo) The vehicle used by him to ‘chase’ the woman. (Source: Express Photo)

A day after Haryana state BJP chief Subhash Barala’s son Vikas Barala and his friend Ashish Kumar were arrested and released by Chandigarh police for allegedly stalking the daughter of a senior IAS officer, the 29-year old woman recounted her ordeal and thanked police for their prompt action.

Speaking to news agency ANI, the girl said, “They (accused) kept following my car. They tried to block my way and then even tried to open the door of my car.”

Chandigarh police on Friday arrested the two and charged them for wrongful restraint and driving under the influence of alcohol. They was later released on bail.

Speaking to Indian Express, the girl expressed her gratitude to the Chandigarh police. “I am thankful to the Chandigarh police for promptly responding to my call. This could have gone worse.”

Describing Friday night’s incident, she wrote on Facebook, “Was almost kidnapped on a Chandigarh road last night”. “There were 2 guys inside the SUV, and they seemed to really be enjoying harassing a lone girl in the middle of the night.”

Describing her condition, she wrote, “My hands shaking, my back spasming (sic) from fear, half in tears, half bewildered, because I didn’t know if I’d make it home tonight.” She added, “If this is what women deal with in one of the safer cities in the country, where are we going? I find it shocking, that in a place with cameras at every light and cops every 200 metres, these boys thought they could either get into my car, or take me into theirs, just because they’re from an influential background. I’m lucky, it seems, to not be the daughter of a common man, because what chance would they have against such VIPs? I’m also lucky, because I’m not lying raped and murdered in a ditch somewhere.”

Speaking to media, DPS Satish Kumar said the accused were let go as the charges against them were bailable. “The accused had purchased two cans of beer and consumed it while driving the Safari that belongs to Vikas’s relative. They kept following the woman and blocked her way several times. The woman called the Police Control Room at about 12.35 am and within 10 minutes, the accused were caught. Later, after receiving a formal complaint, we registered a criminal case against both of them and arrested them. Since the charges against them were bailable, both were released on bail,” the police official said.

German publisher sues Turkey over jailing of reporter,"German media group WeltN24 has filed a complaint against Turkey with the European Court of Human Rights over the jailing of one of its reporters. The publisher says German-Turkish reporter Deniz Yucel’s imprisonment has prevented his newspaper, Die Welt, from being able to report from Turkey since February.

WeltN24’s chief executive Stephanie Caspar said in a statement today that the company was using “all possible legal means to defend both Deniz Yucel’s and the publisher’s freedom of press.”

Yucel is one of several Germans arrested by Turkey on suspicion of aiding forbidden groups. WeltN24 says Yucel, who has already filed a separate human rights complaint of his own with the Strasbourg-based court, has yet to receive an indictment.

Turkey arrested more than 100 journalists following last year’s failed coup.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) has constituted a five-member committee to look into a regulation on minimum qualification for university, college teachers and other academic staff. Former Himachal Pradesh University Vice Chancellor Sunil Kumar Gupta-led panel was notified on Friday following the Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry’s direction to amend the regulation.

The UGC’s new regulations notified in July 2016 for maintenance of standards had triggered protests. The regulations included increase of two-hour workload with tutorials being taken away from the ambit of teaching hours. They prescribed stringent rules for calculation of Academic Performance Indicators for promotion of teachers.

Following protests, then HRD Minister Smriti Irani had assured the teachers that the workload will remain unchanged. Some teachers are concerned over the panel’s constitution especially when the Seventh Pay Commission is to be implemented.

"Keaton Jennings will make a success at international cricket, says Trevor Bayliss","Keaton Jennings scored 48 against South Africa earlier in the third match. (Source: AP) Keaton Jennings scored 48 against South Africa earlier in the third match. (Source: AP)

England coach Trevor Bayliss has backed opening batsman Keaton Jennings to sort his batting and succeed in international cricket despite not having a good outing in the series against South Africa. While several questions have been raised about his technique, Bayliss has claimed that Jennings has the right attitude to overcome his shortcomings.

“Test cricket is a harsh world to come into. The one thing you would expect every player to have (is) guts – determination, the desire to improve and get better,” said Bayliss and added, “We thought in the second innings at The Oval he showed real application (scoring 48) and he really applied himself and got stuck in. Again today he started showing glimpses of someone who has made adjustments,” added Bayliss.

He further added, “There is a lot said about players being found out at international level, he found out a lot about himself in these last few test matches and there are areas of his game that he would want to work on but there hasn’t been time to take a step back and perhaps work at things he would like to work on and enable him to be more successful in test cricket.”

Stating that Jennings does have the right attitude to survive, Bayliss added, “The one thing we would judge him on is his character, his personality to cope with the last few weeks. I have to say he is a very honest young man who works extremely hard at his game and given the chance to get through this spell and work at his game I think he will make a success at international cricket.”

Jab Harry Met Sejal box office collection day 2: Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma’s film collects Rs 30.25 crores,"Jab Harry Met Sejal box office collection day 2: Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma’s film shows a dip in box office collection. Jab Harry Met Sejal box office collection day 2: Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma’s film shows a dip in box office collection.

Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma’s much-awaited film Jab Harry Met Sejal, which released on August 4 has shown a dip in its second-day box office performance. The film, which had an opening of Rs 15.25 crores, has managed to mint only Rs 15 crores on Saturday, which makes its total collection Rs 30. 25 crores.

While the film opened with a figure of Rs 15.25 crores, it is still lesser than the opening day collection of Shah Rukh’s last release, Raees ( Rs 20.42 crore). According to Bollywood trade analyst Taran Adarsh, the Imtiaz Ali film is the biggest openers of 2017 along with popular films like SS Rajamouli’s Baahubali: The Conclusion, Salman Khan’s Tubelight, Shah Rukh Khan’s earlier release Raees and Akshay Kumar’s Jolly LLB 2.

The film also released amidst the holiday of Rakshabandhan, which falls on Monday. Hence along with the advantage of having holidays on the weekend, the film might also show an upward trend on Monday.

Jab Harry Met Sejal has not opened to great reviews, however, and viewers have had mixed reactions to the film. An indianexpress.com audience reaction report said that most people enjoyed the first half of the film but couldn’t enjoy the second half of it. This film marked Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma’s first collaboration with director Imtiaz Ali who is known for telling unique love stories where travel plays a major role.

Jab Harry Met Sejal also marks Anushka Sharma’s second film this year after Phillauri which was produced by her. The film had done decently at the box office.

Jab Harry Met Sejal also saw Shah Rukh Khan playing the romantic hero once again. Throughout 2016, we had seen him as a psychologist, a VFX-ed 19-year-old Delhi boy and earlier in 2017 as a gangster.

Olympic long jump champion Jeff Henderson fails to qualify for final at World Championships,"Jeff Henderson is the Olympic champion. (Source: Reuters) Jeff Henderson is the Olympic champion. (Source: Reuters)

Jeff Henderson, the Olympic long jump champion, was the first major casualty of the World Athletics Championships on Friday when he failed to qualify for the final.

The 28-year-old American, who triumphed in dramatic fashion by one centimetre in Rio de Janeiro last year, could only leap 7.84 metres in the qualifying round, finishing 17th overall and failing to make the final dozen.

In contrast, the man Henderson pipped to the Olympic title last year, silver medallist Luvo Manyonga, eased into the final, surpassing the qualification mark of 8.05 metres with a leap of 8.12.

Henderson had not enjoyed the greatest of seasons but following an 8.28m jump at the U.S. Championships in June, his victory at the recent Diamond League meeting in the same London Stadium had suggested he was peaking well enough.

After an opening leap of 7.74m, though, a second-round no jump put him under pressure and his final round improvement of 10 centimetres was not enough.

“It’s not what I wanted at all, I wanted to do better but I guess it’s harder to come back after last year (winning the Olympic Games),” Henderson told reporters.

“It’s been a long year, I didn’t really much get training compared to last year, but I’ll be back hungry and stronger next year. You’ll see the Jeff Henderson you saw previously.”

Manyonga, the South African who overcame a drug addiction to win his Olympic medal, took a comfortable first leap towards an even more striking result.

The man whose dramatic fightback after his life had seemed at rock bottom was one of the most heartwarming stories in Rio, needed just one jump to make the final.

The 25-year-old had been a brilliant young talent from a township outside Cape Town who was feted after winning gold at the 2010 World Junior Championships.

His life, though, took a terrible turn when he became hooked on tik — the local variant of crystal methamphetamine — in what he described as his “date with the devil”.

He ended up being banned from athletics for 18 months after a dope test showed traces of the recreational drug as his life went into such freefall that he felt he ended up only “five percent away” from death.

After undergoing drug rehabilitation, Manyonga returned to action fully last season and made such a dramatic breakthrough that he fractionally missed out on the Olympic crown to Henderson.

Only last month, though, Manyonga suffered an athletic setback when he succumbed to an ankle injury while winning a Diamond League meeting in Stockholm and he had shown no real form since.

Czech Radek Juska was the leading qualifier, leaping 8.24m, ahead of Cuban Maykel Masso (8.15m), another South African Ruswahl Samaai (8.14m) and Manyonga.

Karnataka I-T raids end: ‘Rs 300 crore in undisclosed income found’,"Bengaluru: Karnataka Energy minister D K Shivakumar at his residence in Bengaluru on Wednesday.The Income Tax Department today conducted searches at multiple properties in connection with a tax evasion case. PTI Photo

PTI Photo(PTI8_2_2017_000090A) *** Local Caption ***

The Income Tax (I-T) department on Saturday concluded searches at premises linked to Karnataka Energy Minister D K Shivakumar. Sources said that the department has reported to have found over Rs 300 crore undisclosed income of Shivakumar and his associates. They added that Rs 100 crore income is linked to Shivakumar and his family. Sources said that cash and jewellery seized after the raids is reported to be worth around Rs 15 crore. They said that the undisclosed income is likely to go up since a lot of incriminating documents have been found.

Shivakumar had declared assets worth Rs 251 crore in his 2013 election affidavit while his brother and MP, D K Suresh, had declared Rs 81 crore ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. The searches were conducted at some 70 premises linked to Shivakumar, his family and aides in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Delhi and Chennai. They began on Wednesday while Shivakumar was hosting 44 Gujarat Congress MLAs at a resort near Bengaluru.

The Congress has called the raids politically motivated to target him for hosting the MLAs amid fears that the BJP may poach them to ensure Ahmed Patel’s defeat in the August 8 Rajya Sabha polls.

Earlier, Shivakumar met the MLAs at Karnataka’s Raj Bhavan, where they met Governor and former Gujarat BJP minister Vajubhai Vala, after the searches concluded. The MLAs, who were due to return to Ahmedabad on Saturday, put up a united front along with Shivakumar. “We remain united,” Gujarat Congress leader Shakti Singh Gohil said at the Raj Bhavan.

Shivakumar later went to the Karnataka assembly with the MLAs and posed for photographs at the Gandhi statue there before holding a meeting with the lawmakers. “I have not done anything illegal or unconstitutional,’’ he insisted. “I will speak about the I-T searches after I am provided details of all that was found. The truth cannot be hidden.”

Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund on penalties to win Bundesliga Super Cup,"Bayern Munich after winning the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund. (Source: Reuters) Bayern Munich after winning the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund. (Source: Reuters)

German champions Bayern Munich beat Cup holders Borussia Dortmund 5-4 on penalties to win a record sixth Super Cup after the entertaining curtain-raiser to the new season finished 2-2 in regular time on Saturday.

Bayern goalkeeper Sven Ulreich saved Marc Bartra’s sudden-death spot kick to settle a riveting tie at Dortmund’s packed Signal Iduna Park, as Bayern twice came from behind during the 90 minutes and also turned the tide in the penalty shootout.

Dortmund looked to have done enough after top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a superb 71st-minute goal to give the home side a 2-1 lead but they were undone by a late Lukasz Piszczek own-goal.

American 18-year old forward Christian Pulisic fired Dortmund ahead in the 12th minute when he robbed Javi Martinez and steered the ball past Ulreich, moments after Robert Lewandowski fired over the bar at the other end.

Bayern’s hitman Lewandowski made amends six minutes later with a simple tap-in from three metres after a darting run and cross by right back Joshua Kimmich, who beat the offside trap.

Dortmund keeper Roman Buerki made four superb saves in the opening half to deny Thomas Mueller twice, Sebastian Rudy and the evergreen Franck Ribery, who gave his markers a roasting on the left flank.

The pace remained unrelenting after the break as Bayern pressed forward but were again punished for squandering several opportunities.

Released by strike partner Ousmane Dembele, the elusive Aubameyang slipped through the middle and dinked his shot with the outside of his foot over Ulreich from 13 metres.

Just when the home fans were ready to start celebrating, an almighty melee ensued in the 88th minute after the ball cannoned off the Dortmund crossbar and Piszczek turned it into his own net after Kimmich got a touch.

Dortmund again gained the upper hand during the shootout as Buerki saved Kimmich’s shot, but his counterpart Ulreich then denied Sebastian Rode and Bartra to hand Bayern their first trophy of the season.

Lok Sabha passes bill for setting up petroleum institute in Andhra Pradesh,"The Lok Sabha on Friday passed a bill which provides for establishing the Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE) in Andhra Pradesh that will impart high quality education and conduct advance research in all aspects relating to the conventional hydrocarbons. The IIPE is being set up at Visakhapatnam at a cost of Rs 650 crore as part of a package promised by the Centre to Andhra Pradesh after Telangana was carved out of it.

Moving ‘The Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy Bill, 2017’ for consideration and passage, Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan said the benefit of the institute would not be accrued only to Andhra Pradesh but India and the world as a whole. “It will have a futuristic impact…Youth will be benefited,” he said, adding it would cover both conventional and non-conventional forms of energy.

He also informed the House that India along with China, Japan and the US are doing research on gas hydrates.

For this, the KG basin is expected to be a prolific basin and it may meet the demand of India for 100 years, he said.

Visakhapatnam is the right place for this institute and it holds an important position in India as Houston in America, the minister said, adding that in the coming days, Visakhapatnam, Kakinada and Rajahmundry could become Houston of India.

This institute, he said, will create jobs for local people also as their would be a lot of non-teaching staff.

The government is committed to provide affordable energy to the people of the country, he added.

To be declared as an institution of national importance, the IIPE would provide high quality education and conduct advance research in all aspects relating to the conventional hydrocarbons, according to the Objects and Reasons of the bill.

Among others, the institute would actively pursue research and development in the fields such as liquefied natural gas, biofuels and renewables.

Pradhan said such a status for the institute, which began enrolling students from the last academic year, would pave the way for quality education and research needed to monetise the oil and gas resources available in the region.

KG basin has more resources than the Mumbai gas field, he said, adding however that it had its own challenges.

Quality human resources was needed to monetise the resources on offer, he told the House.

The state government has provided 200 acre land and the central government has made a provision of Rs 650 crore for the institute, which was being mentored by IIT, Kharagpur, he added.

The institute’s development was envisaged by the Act, which had divided Andhra pradesh into two states, passed by Parliament in 2014 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was committed to fulfilling promsies made to the two states, he said.

Participating in the debate on the bill, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury (Congres) said his party paid a heavy price for dividing the state but it stuck to its commitment, underlining that it puts “country before party”.

He also used the debate to attack the government over its decision to gradually remove the LPG subsidy, saying “the oil world showered its blessings on Pradhan” as the crude oil price fell by more than a half but he did not share the bounty with the poor.

Over 18 crore people getting the subsidy would not get it, he said, wondering how they became “rich” overnight.

Taking a dig at the ruling side, the Congress member asked, “Is it because you people read Ramcharit Manas or Hanuman Chalisa more?”

Before the bill was taken up for consideration, the House saw a tiff between the treasury benches and Congress members, who objected to the move as well as the Speaker’s decision to defer Zero Hour for this.

“Don’t bulldoze. The Zero Hour was not taken up yesterday as well,” Leader of Congress Mallikarjun Kharge said.

Speaker Sumitra Mahajan assured him that it would be taken up later in the day.

Members who participated in the discussion includes Raghav Lakhanpal (BJP), Prem Singh Chandumajra (SAD), Ratna De (TMC), Kaushalendra Kumar – JD (U), A T Nana Patil (BJP), Bhagwant Mann (AAP), N K Premachandran (RSP), Ravindra Kushawaha (BJP), Rajesh Ranjan (RJD).

Delhi HC absolves 75-year-old ex-DU prof of sexual harassment charge,"In a move to end his financial ordeal, Justice V Kameswar Rao also asked the varsity administration to release all arrears and retiral benefits within three months to its former head of Sanskrit Department. In a move to end his financial ordeal, Justice V Kameswar Rao also asked the varsity administration to release all arrears and retiral benefits within three months to its former head of Sanskrit Department.

The Delhi High Court has absolved a 75-year-old former Delhi University (DU) professor of the charge of sexual harassment levelled against him by two researchers 16 years ago. The court set aside the March 2002 decision of DU’s Executive Council to disengage the professor from services. In a move to end his financial ordeal, Justice V Kameswar Rao also asked the varsity administration to release all arrears and retiral benefits within three months to its former head of Sanskrit Department.

The professor, who was of 60 years of age when the action was taken against him, could have continued in service for two more years. However, the court made clear that he shall not be entitled to any arrears for the period of two years, except that the two years shall be treated as period spent on duty.

It did not accept DU’s demand that the matter be sent back again to its enquiry committee for fresh adjudication, as the court had set aside the findings on the grounds that the panel had not granted the professor the opportunity to cross-examine the complainants and did not supply a copy of the panel’s report. The court observed that the professor had moved it only to erase the stigma and did not seek any monetary relief on account of loss of service for two years.

“This court is of the view that the age of the petitioner, who is said to be of 75 years, the researchers also have equally aged, a remand for fresh enquiry from the stage of framing of charges and allowing cross examination of the witnesses would be an embarrassment for the parties at this stage of their life.

“That apart, the process to complete the enquiry may take some time and if an order is passed against the petitioner, the same can be subject matter of a challenge which may take further time for a decision. It shall be appropriate, if the matter is put at rest, but with limited relief to the petitioner,” the court added.

The court, in its order, also noted, “it is a conceded position that during the time when the enquiry was conducted by the Enquiry Committee, there were no rules framed by the University for enquiring into the allegations of sexual harassment”.

The professor had moved the court against the Council’s order and alleged that that the enquiry committee constituted by the Vice Chancellor to investigate the allegations had failed to follow the due process. Through his counsel, he had submitted in the court that no charge sheet was filed against him, nor was he asked to explain the charges. His counsel had argued that the order was unreasoned and was passed in flagrant violation of the principles of natural justice which resulted in the petitioner getting disengaged prematurely, which has put a stigma on the character of the professor.

"For displaced Iraqi, eggplants offer seeds of hope","Myasar Khalil Ali is one of 3.4 million people internally displaced by violence in Iraq, according to figures from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. (Source: Reuters/ Representational) Myasar Khalil Ali is one of 3.4 million people internally displaced by violence in Iraq, according to figures from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. (Source: Reuters/ Representational)

When Myasar Khalil Ali fled Islamic State with his family three years ago one of the handful of possessions he was able to take were green eggplant seeds, which have germinated into a profitable small business. The Iraqi, who once ran a photocopying business in the mainly Turkmen town of Tal Afar, grows the green eggplants next to the blue tarpaulin of Yahyawa camp, in the Lilan district of Kirkuk where he now lives.

Ali is one of 3.4 million people internally displaced by violence in Iraq, according to figures from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In all, 11 million are in need of humanitarian assistance.

Ali sells 1 kg (2.2 lbs) for around 1,000 Iraqi dinars ($0.85) at the camp’s grocery store, welcome money to help provide for his six children. “After displacement to Kirkuk, I could not find a job to feed my family and my children,” said Ali after watering his little farm.

Tending to his narrow farm each day with his children, Ali said he is now able to produce around 20 kgs of the vegetable each day. Eggplants are also called aubergines.

Ali said demand for his produce was high from customers both inside and outside the camp, with an aubergine order even coming from Baghdad. “We prepared and planted seeds and we made it a 100 percent success, thank God. I planted an area of some tens of metres near my tent and thank God the produce is very good,” he said.

No coordination between Lebanon and Syrian armies against IS: Lebanese military source,"Hezbollah fighters are seen escorting buses in Jroud Arsal, Lebanon August 2, 2017.

The Lebanese army will not coordinate with the Syrian army to fight against Islamic State in the Lebanese-Syrian border zone, a military source told Reuters on Saturday, rejecting a local media report of direct military cooperation between the two. The source said the Lebanese army had the military capability to confront and defeat the group without any regional or international support.

The presence of Islamic State and Nusra Front militants in pockets on Lebanon’s border is the biggest military spillover into the country from Syria’s civil war. An offensive launched last month by Lebanon’s Hezbollah – a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad – forced Nusra Front militants to leave for a rebel-held area in northwest Syria under an evacuation deal. The Lebanese army did not take part in that offensive, but has been widely expected to lead an attack against the Islamic State pocket.

On Friday Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said an assault on Islamic State militants in the border zone would begin in a few days. He said the Lebanese army would attack Islamic State from the Lebanese side of the border while Hezbollah and the Syrian army would simultaneously attack from the Syrian side.

Hezbollah has been fighting alongside the Syrian army against rebels including hardline Sunni Islamists in Syria. On Saturday Lebanese newspaper al-Joumhouria reported from sources that direct military coordination had occurred between the Syrian and Lebanese armies regarding the upcoming offensive against Islamic State.

The military source said the Lebanese army had been attacking Islamic State for some time, by preventing it spreading further and cutting supply routes. Lebanese state news agency NNA and a Hezbollah media unit said on Saturday the Lebanese army had shelled Islamic State positions in the Ras Baalbek and al-Qaa areas of northeast Lebanon.

7 kinds of outdoor furniture you can invest in during monsoon,"Brass stools give a regal appearance to any home or garden. (Source: File Photo) Brass stools give a regal appearance to any home or garden. (Source: File Photo)

During the rainy season, sitting outside and soaking in the pleasant weather has a different charm altogether. Invest in hanging chair, teak wood carved swings and wicker furniture for enjoying the experience, suggest experts.

Surabhi Mittal, founder at Revived by Surabhi, and Sunil Gupta, founder and Director at ExportersIndia.com, have listed a few options:

* Outdoor hanging chair: Choose a durable material such as cast metal. Alternatively, it may fit in the balcony with a rope swing bed which can be adorned with lovely cushions and seating.

* Garden table and chair or stool set: A garden table and chair set can be an excellent addition to the furniture collection this monsoon. Purchase one in light plastic or black metal. One made entirely of wood is best avoided as it can deteriorate significantly due to high moisture content and dampness in the air.

* Brass stools: Brass stools give a regal appearance to any home or garden. This type of furniture is an excellent fit for a garden during the monsoon season as it does not have any long term or adverse effects from exposure to moisture or damp air. Also, such stools do not take up much space, and can be doubled as a comfortable outdoor seating furniture and foot stool.

* Teak wood carved swings: Teak is one of the most popular materials in wood, and is used in both furniture and flooring. This type of wood is also used in making garden swings, a beautiful and sophisticated addition to any patio. Buy teak wood based swings that have intricate carvings for that added glamour to the outdoor seating area.

* Outdoor wicker furniture: Wicker is more a technique than material used to create furniture. It is usually made of cane-based materials, and is a perfect fit for any garden or patio. It is known for being extremely comfortable and at the same time it gives a boho-chic yet classy vibe to the overall home décor.

* Aluminium or wooden outdoor lounge chair: A must have furniture for any garden area or patio, lounge chairs are perfect for enjoying late evening moments, whether it is sipping a hot cup of tea or chatting with the special someone.

Buy one that is made of sturdy material, so invest in ones that are made of either aluminium or hardwood.

* Roller-compacted concrete (RCC) precast concrete bench: Concrete benches are used for sitting purpose usually in gardens and parks, and give a smart and classy look. They can last throughout different weather conditions.

Although these benches are generally used for sitting, they are actually multipurpose. They can be used to lounge, lean and can accommodate more persons than one.

These benches are made of concrete, which is a composite material made up of two or more components. It makes them quite heavy and sturdy, which means it is a long-term investment.

Jimmy Walker strides into halfway lead at WGC-Bridgestone,"Jimmy Walker during the second round of the WGC – Bridgestone. (Source: USA Today Sports) Jimmy Walker during the second round of the WGC – Bridgestone. (Source: USA Today Sports)

Jimmy Walker, one week away from the defense of his PGA Championship title, fired a five-under 65 to seize a two-shot lead after two rounds of the World Golf Championship-Bridgestone Invitational on Friday.

Walker was unfazed by a pair of weather delays totaling nearly five hours and registered six birdies and a bogey to reach the midway mark on seven-under-par 133 at Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio.

First-round leader Thomas Pieters of Belgium was alone in second after adding a level-par 70 to his opening 65.

Tied for third on four-under 136 were world number three Hideki Matsuyama, who posted three late birdies for 67, four-times major winner Rory McIlroy (69) and twice major winner Zach Johnson (67).

“Once we got back out there after the delay, I think everybody felt a little flat,” said McIlroy. “I didn’t help myself by missing a few chances as soon as we came back out.

“Luckily I found one birdie coming in,” added the Northern Irishman, who chipped in for birdie at the 16th.

British Open champion Jordan Spieth shot even-par to stand another shot back with Australian Jason Day among six players bunched at 137.

Day got as low as five-under with five birdies on the front nine despite feeling a tweak in his back early in the round. He later suffered from the effects, pulling tee shots left into trees and rough, and made his way gingerly to the finish.

Walker is winless this season and has struggled since being diagnosed with Lyme disease in April. He has been unable to make an impact at the big events, finishing tied for 54th at the British Open, tied for 56th at The Players and missing the cut at the U.S. Open.

The Texan said it had been a very long day, beginning two hours early in hopes of getting done ahead of expected thunderstorms, but just what he needed.

“It did feel like a marathon, but was a great day. Played solid, hit it well, made some putts,” said Walker, who has been plagued by bouts of fatigue among other disease symptoms.

“It’s just important for me to have a good week. I haven’t had too many this year.”

Walker took the lead with a birdie following one of his trademark, high-arcing iron shots that landed two feet from the cup at the par-three 12th.

“It’s been kind of rough. Things have been trending, I feel like, and hopefully it’s shades of things to come,” he said.

“It’s still there,” he said of the effect of the Lyme disease. “I still deal with it. It’s better than it was, but it’s still there. It affects different parts of your daily life. I just keep plugging away.”

S Korean foreign minister open to meeting N Korean counterpart,"South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, center, is escorted as she arrives to attend the 50th ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and its dialogue partners at the airport in Manila, Philippines on Saturday, Aug. 5, 2017.

(AP Photo/Aaron Favila)

South Korea’s new foreign minister said on Saturday she was open to rare discussions with her North Korean counterpart on the sidelines of a security summit in the Philippines. “If there is an opportunity that naturally occurs, we should talk,” Kang Kyung-Wha told reporters as she landed in Manila today, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency.

North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Hong-Yo, is also attending the regional summit, which is hosted by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The potential meetings come as the North faces intense international pressure to curtail its nuclear weapons programme.

The United Nations Security Council will vote this weekend on a US-drafted resolution to toughen sanctions against North Korea following its second intercontinental ballistic missile test on July 28. The United States said it would also seek to build unified pressure on the North at the Manila event, known as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is attending.

But the newly elected South Korean government of President Moon Jae-In is also much more open to negotiations than the previous administration run by Park Geun-Hye. Kang, South Korea’s first female foreign minister, said any meeting with Ri would be an opportunity “to deliver our desire for the North to stop its provocations and positively respond to our recent special offers (for talks) aimed at establishing a peace regime”.

In July Seoul proposed military talks with Pyongyang but the North refused to respond. Had they gone ahead, they would have been the first official inter-Korean talks since 2015. Tensions on the Korean peninsula often dominate the ARF because it is one of the few annual diplomatic gatherings attended by the key stakeholders: South Korea, North Korea, the United States, Russia, China and Japan.

In the run up to this year’s summit, Washington had lobbied to have Pyongyang kicked out of the ARF but there is limited appetite among Asian countries to shut North Korea out of one of the few diplomatic gatherings it attends. Washington is determined to ratchet up pressure on the North after a series of missile tests that Pyongyang has declared puts American cities within their reach.

"Telangana wants drinking water, other schemes out of GST ambit","The GST Council has decided to reduce the tax from 18 per cent to 12 per cent for the said schemes, the release said. (Representational image) The GST Council has decided to reduce the tax from 18 per cent to 12 per cent for the said schemes, the release said. (Representational image)

GST should not be levied on ongoing schemes pertaining to drinking water, roads and irrigation, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said, adding that a “legal battle has to be fought” if the Centre does not change its decision. “By implementing the GST, the project estimates will increase and the same cannot be included in the budget now. Hence, the Centre should change its decision, or else a legal battle has to be fought in this regard,” a release from the Chief Minister’s Office said quoting Rao.

The issue was raised in the GST Council meetings earlier. The same was reiterated by state IT Minister K T Rama Rao in the GST Council meeting held yesterday, said the release issued late last night. The chief minister demanded that the GST be removed on drinking water schemes, laying of roads and irrigation.

The GST Council has decided to reduce the tax from 18 per cent to 12 per cent for the said schemes, the release said. “But the Centre has decided to levy 12 per cent GST on the ongoing projects,” it added. Rao had written letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on the matter and the state government has already registered its protest on the issue, itsaid.

“It is an injustice to levy GST on the ongoing projects. By implementing GST on the projects started before July 1, the loss will be to the tune of Rs 19,000 crore. Not only Telangana, but all other states will incur this loss,” the chief minister said.

It will be difficult to implement a decision taken after the presentation of the budget as the project details have to be included in the budget, the release quoted Rao as saying. Rao termed the decision “unilateral” and decided to write a fresh letter to the prime minister on the matter today, according to the release.

"River, a strong brown god","People would generally replant saplings in the alluvium even if the original saplings were buried under it. But this time, there is no way out. The seed beds too have been submerged. People would generally replant saplings in the alluvium even if the original saplings were buried under it. But this time, there is no way out. The seed beds too have been submerged.

A deafening sound at midnight suddenly woke up the village. The Solengi had torn through an embankment somewhere; its waters flowed swiftly through Balitika, Rajabari, Bilotiya, Murhanigaon and other villages. Hearing the roar of the gushing waters, panic-stricken people rushed to the safer portion of the embankment. While the women picked up whatever few household items they could hurriedly collect, the men watched the flow of the water at the breached portion. The gushing waters soon inundated fields, homes, and the village road. In no time, the entire village was under water.

People living by the river are familiar with floods, but this time, the situation is critical. People would generally replant saplings in the alluvium even if the original saplings were buried under it. But this time, there is no way out. The seed beds too have been submerged.

These people have been living by the river for generations. The river destroys their houses and chases them away, but once the flood waters recede, they return. This time around, it has been difficult to even find the bank. Where is it? It is now a vast expanse of water, a sea. Scared of the darkness of the night, the little ones are crying. Someone has shifted a little girl and her mother to a safer place on a banana-trunk raft. The girl has been crying inconsolably — “I want to go home, I want to go home”.

There aren’t many boats in the village. Those who don’t have boats depend on the rafts, cut from banana plants, when the floods come. These rafts are not only a mode of transportation; cooking, eating, sleeping, all happen on them. Children, women and the elderly — all know how to handle a raft. Where are these people going on the rafts? They are looking for higher ground. Human beings, cattle, goats, poultry birds, have all taken shelter on the same higher ground, least bothered by the presence of snakes and other reptiles. All living beings are exhausted.

Those who have taken shelter in temporary sheds on the embankment are discussing — our saplings are submerged; the water has entered our granary; the sand deposit will kill our betel-nut and coconut palms; Shobhan’s cow was caught in a whirlpool along with its calf; Seuti’s husband died when his boat overturned near Borghuli; two young siblings of Majukuchi were washed away along with their house by the Satrang’s flood.

But now, they are mostly talking about rescue. Will it be possible to rescue the cows, buffaloes, goats and poultry? Will it be difficult to plant saplings afresh, because the fields will all be covered in sand? The floods have anyway created an emergency, but there is a bigger emergency in Gobinda’s house. Not exactly house, but a shed on the embankment. His daughter-in-law is in labour. Where do they take her now? There is only water all around. The embankment on which they have taken shelter has breached a little distance away, causing the water level to rise further. There is now no link to the highway.

People of 11 villages have taken shelter in this portion of the embankment. A few young men somehow manage to get a boat to take the woman to a hospital. But she gives birth to a girl on the way, in the middle of the water. They name her Plabita, from plaban, which means flood. Not all are as fortunate as Plabita’s parents. Bogadhar’s grandmother, who was running a high fever for several days, breathed her last on a raft while on the way to hospital. Cremating the body had become a problem.

Hunger is a dangerous thing. It can wipe out all kinds of feeling and emotion. Whatever little food the people had managed to bring with them got exhausted in a couple of days. The children are crying for food; the parents are simply helpless. Human beings have turned inhuman because of hunger. They are snatching whatever food and clothing the relief teams have brought. Hunger has snatched away people’s self-respect too.

One day, the government’s rescue operation began. But even before that, a voluntary organisation had already shifted people to the highway. This year, the floods have been devastating. Villages which never got inundated in the past are submerged. The highway, schools, public buildings have all become relief camps. Women and the elderly have been compelled to shed their sense of privacy while responding to nature’s call. The rivers that have played havoc in this area are Mornoi, Dubiya, Solengi, Satrang, Balijan, Brahmajan and Buroi. Mahabahu Brahmaputra has risen, displayed its clout.

O’ Shantanukulandan! Why have you taken such a terrible form? The people of this valley have, through the ages, realised your immense power. Civilisations have thrived by your banks because of the love, trust and dependence the people feel for you. But why have you assumed such a destructive form today? What did you say? Because the people have meted out atrocities towards nature? The rivers have filled up their beds with sediments carried down the mountains because people have destroyed the environment? Why are you causing such suffering to the innocent wild animals? What did you say? Because the people have failed to protect them?

O’ Shantanukulanandan! I know you do not willingly want to cause such a massive destruction. The environment awareness of our people is increasing, our scientists are coming up with various innovations, and I am sure one day the people of this valley will be able to secure your blessings. I pray to you with folded hands, O’ Shantanukulanandan!

US breaching nuclear deal as President Rouhani starts new term: Iran,"The mounting crisis creates a difficult position for Hassan Rouhani, a 68-year-old moderate who won re-election largely thanks to his efforts at repairing relations with the West.

Iran said Thursday that new US sanctions were a violation of its nuclear deal with world powers, piling pressure on President Hassan Rouhani as he started his second term. Rouhani vowed to continue his efforts to end the country’s isolation as he was sworn in by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei following his re-election in May.

But the ceremony came less than 24 hours after US President Donald Trump confirmed fresh sanctions against Iran. Tehran says the new measures violate its 2015 deal with world powers that eased sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, an agreement which Trump has repeatedly threatened to tear up.

“We believe that the nuclear deal has been violated and we will react appropriately,” deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said on state television.

“We will certainly not fall into the trap of US policy and Trump, and our reaction will be very carefully considered.”

The mounting crisis creates a difficult position for Rouhani, a 68-year-old moderate who won re-election largely thanks to his efforts at repairing relations with the West.

“We will never accept isolation,” Rouhani said as he was sworn in in front of top political and military officials.

“The nuclear deal is a sign of Iran’s goodwill on the international stage,” he added.

Khamenei took a tougher line, saying Iran must not fall for Washington’s “tricks”.

“The enemy’s hostility has made us more resistant,” he said.

New US sanctions have emboldened Rouhani’s hardline opponents, who say he should never have trusted the United States.

“It’s unfortunate timing,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran analyst with the European Council on Foreign Relations.

“What will be absolutely critical is how the Europeans position themselves,” she said, pointing to the burgeoning trade ties with Europe and their continued backing of the nuclear deal.

Britain, France and Germany — who signed the deal along with Russia, China and the United States — remain firm backers of the agreement and have criticised the Trump administration for threatening to scrap it.

French energy giant Total defied US pressure in July by signing a multi-billion-dollar gas deal with Iran.

“What Iranians are banking on at the moment, maybe overestimating, is that Europe will safeguard and build on the deal, and make it too politically costly for Trump to tear it up, or at least show Washington that if it walks away, it will be doing so alone,” said Geranmayeh.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly certified that Iran is sticking by its commitments under the agreement — a position that has been reluctantly accepted by the Trump White House. But with Iran gaining the upper hand across the Middle East, through its support for proxies in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, US lawmakers appear determined to ratchet up tensions.

Meanwhile, Rouhani also faces challenges as he tries to impose civilian control over the economy. Since the election, he has engaged in a war of words with the Revolutionary Guards over their outsized role in the economy — although they have since sought to bury the hatchet with a public show of unity.

"Without Neymar, PSG win season-opener against Amiens","Edinson Cavani scores a goal against Amiens. (Source: AP) Edinson Cavani scores a goal against Amiens. (Source: AP)

The star was missing but the party went ahead successfully at the Parc des Princes on Saturday as Paris Saint-Germain won its French league season-opener.

Without Neymar on the pitch, Edinson Cavani and Javier Pastore took on the scoring responsibilities to ensure PSG got a winning start by beating promoted Amiens 2-0. It was only PSG’s fourth win in its last 12 season-opening games in Ligue 1.

World-record signing Neymar was ineligible to play because of paperwork issues and PSG coach Unai Emery opted for a 4-3-3 formation with Pastore and Angel Di Maria supporting Cavani.

Just like the fans, Neymar watched from the stands. The French league did not receive his international transfer certificate from the Spanish federation before Friday night’s deadline, despite his 222 million euro ($262 million) move from Barcelona being completed the previous day.

“All I know is that the club did everything to have the player’s transfer ratified,” Emery said. “He prepared for the game with the group, we waited until the very end. I don’t know if Spain did everything, but PSG did all it could,”

Neymar did not play but he gave fans something to cheer about during his official presentation before the game. Neymar was unveiled at a ceremony involving fireworks and did a lap of honor.

The 25-year-old Brazil international is now expected to make his debut on Aug. 13 against Guingamp.

“With Neymar we can get bigger,” said Emery, whose main objectives this season are to win the Champions League and to regain the French league title his players relinquished to Monaco last season.

Hired a few weeks before Neymar this summer, Brazil defender Dani Alves was given his first start, while Alphonse Areola was prefered to Kevin Trapp in goal.

Amiens has the smallest budget of the league with 25 million euros _ not much more than a tenth of what PSG paid for Neymar _ and it showed. Amiens gave away possession immediately after kickoff with a long ball that went out of bounds. The visitors were then pegged back into their own half until the break.

“We hoped that some PSG players would have their minds turned to partying because of Neymar, but they were all serious,” Amiens coach Christophe Pelissier said. “We did what we could, but it was really tough offensively.”

Arguably the man of the match, Cavani was a constant threat with his runs and the 34-year-old Alves showed age is not slowing him down.

Bossing the midfield and enjoying possession, PSG combined well in Amiens’ box with a series of quick passes that unsettled the visitors’ back four, although it took Emery’s side some time to find the net.

The hosts had two good chances in the first 10 minutes but Cavani sent the first over, then fired wide after being set up by Di Maria on both occasions.

PSG’s next chance came in the 18th minute from a corner that ended with Adrien Rabiot, but his header flew over the bar. Rabiot tested Regis Gurtner with a low shot soon after the half-hour, yet his strike was too weak and comfortably stopped.

Cavani finally broke the deadlock with three minutes left in the first half from Alves’ assist. The Uruguay striker controlled the ball with his right foot and slotted home with his left into the bottom corner.

PSG kept dominating after the interval as Di Maria produced a good save from Gurtner with a left-footed volley from Marco Verratti’s precise pass, and Cavani had another shot blocked in the 75th.

Pastore doubled PSG’s lead in the 80th at the end of a counterattack after Verratti released the ball for Cavani, who sent it to the Argentine midfielder to finish off the slick passing move with a calm finish.

Defending champion Monaco opened its title defense with a 3-2 win over Toulouse on Friday.

Diaz scores two on Lyon debut

Mariano Diaz scored a brace as Lyon thrashed promoted Strasbourg 4-0, with captain Nabil Fekir also scoring twice against the Ligue 2 champions. Diaz showed he can be a fine replacement for France striker Alexandre Lacazette, who left for Arsenal over the summer.

Diaz, who joined from Real Madrid, was recommended to Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas by Madrid’s France forward Karim Benzema. The easy victory lifted Lyon to an early lead in the standings on goal difference.

Nice lose another opener

After securing a third-place finish last season, Nice has now lost five of its last six season-openers. Jonathan Bamba scored the only goal as Saint-Etienne new coach Oscar Garcia got off to a winning start with a 1-0 victory at Geoffroy-Guichard stadium.

Nice lacked inspiration throughout the evening, perhaps a consequence of the efforts deployed midweek to reach the Champions League playoffs at the expense of Dutch club Ajax.

Tribute to ‘Lolulou’

Montpellier players gathered and raised their fingers toward the sky in a tribute to the late club president Louis Nicollin after Souleymane Camara gave the hosts a 1-0 win over Caen. Camara became the club’s all-time top scorer with his 48th goal.

All Montpellier players wore a special jersey emblazoned with the word “Loulou,” Nicollin’s nickname. Nicollin, who helped to produce one of the biggest upsets in French football when his unfashionable club won the league in 2012, died in June, on his 74th birthday.

Other results

Troyes and Rennes drew 1-1, and Metz was beaten 3-1 at home by Guingamp.

"Ben Stokes out late, England 260-6 in 4th Test against South Africa","Ben Stokes scored 58 in the fourth Test before getting out to Kagiso Rabada who cleaned him up with a yorker. (Source: AP) Ben Stokes scored 58 in the fourth Test before getting out to Kagiso Rabada who cleaned him up with a yorker. (Source: AP)

Joe Root survived one chance but not a second one, and Ben Stokes fell just before stumps, as England finished Day 1 of the final Test against South Africa on 260-6 on Friday.

The in-form Ben Stokes was bowled for 58 by Kagiso Rabada an over before the close at Old Trafford, giving South Africa a late boost after the tourists twice had England in a hole early in the series-deciding test, and twice saw the home team fight its way out.

Jonny Bairstow was 33 not out and nightwatchman Toby Roland-Jones 0 not out at the close.

Although South Africa, trailing 2-1 and seeking to save the series, edged the day by virtue of its six wickets, a score in excess of 300 by England could be competitive on a feisty pitch that gave the Proteas quick bowlers plenty to work with.

England also still has Moeen Ali, a handy batsman, to come as it seeks a second straight series win over South Africa, but its first at home over the Proteas since 1998.

England twice had to dig deep on Friday, when it was 92-3 with Tom Westley’s departure, and then at 187-5 when Root was lbw for 52 to Duanne Olivier.

England fought well both times, first with a 52-run stand between Dawid Malan and Root, and then with late-afternoon resistance from Stokes and Bairstow in a 65-run partnership that nearly took the home team to stumps.

Rabada had other ideas, spearing in a quick yorker that blew past Stokes’ bat and rattled into his stumps.

Rabada collected 2-52 and Olivier 2-72.

The day reflected the seesaw nature of the series, which has swung one way and then the other: England won heavily in the first test, South Africa dominated the second test, and England was convincing in the third test.

For the decider, Olivier was in the team after South Africa was forced to leave out the injured Vernon Philander, the tourists’ best bowler on current form. South Africa’s pace attack was further weakened with the absence of Chris Morris, also injured.

England skipper Root was again the prize wicket for South Africa after a let-off allowed him to reach his fourth score of 50 or more in seven innings this series, and pass 5,000 test runs.

Root was missed on 40 after South Africa wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock allowed a nick off Morne Morkel to fly past him without moving, apparently thinking it was going straight to first slip. It was well wide of Hashim Amla at slip and De Kock, realizing his big error, sat down and covered his face with his glove.

It cost South Africa just 12 runs _ to De Kock’s relief _ as Olivier trapped Root lbw fairly soon after, with an added bonus for South Africa as Root wasted a review.

That was one of few errors this series for Root, who began his time as England captain with a magnificent 190 in England’s victory in the first test, has batted superbly through the series, and showed strong character to lead England back in front in the series after his leadership was questioned following the second-test defeat.

For Root, his 5,000 test runs have come at a fabulous rate: 57 tests and 105 innings, putting him among some outstanding names. Brian Lara took 104 innings to pass 5,000 and Sachin Tendulkar 103 innings.

Root made a brave decision at the start of the day, choosing to bat after winning the toss with the knowledge that there’s been rain in Manchester this week and the pitch was likely to give early help to the bowlers.

It did, but England lost just Keaton Jennings for 17 _ another failure for him _ in the first session and ground its way to 67-1 at lunch.

The second session swung South Africa’s way with the departure of Alastair Cook (46) and Westley (29) in the space of three overs, and with Malan out for 18 an over before tea. All three of them edged behind.

Root again held up South Africa, hitting six fours and registering a 30th test half-century, to go with 12 centuries, in just 57 tests. Stokes struck eight fours in his 58.

Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino targets more signings ahead of new season,"Mauricio Pellegrino said he expects to see a “different dynamic” from his team when they host Sevilla in their final pre-season friendly. (Source: Reuters) Mauricio Pellegrino said he expects to see a “different dynamic” from his team when they host Sevilla in their final pre-season friendly. (Source: Reuters)

Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino is hoping to recruit more players in what has been an increasingly difficult transfer window for the club ahead of the new Premier League season.

While several English top flight clubs have been on a spending spree, the Saints have only added Polish centre half Jan Bednarek in the close season transfer window.

“We are studying the market,” Pellegrino, who replaced Claude Puel as manager at St Mary’s in June, told reporters. “We have got some options and always we can improve the squad. We will keep going and after we will wait to see what happens.

“The market is difficult, a lot of important teams are challenging for the best players. We are confident that someone can come.” Southampton are also tackling the uncertainty around defender Virgil van Dijk’s future after he was left out of training last month.

Pellegrino said he expects to see a “different dynamic” from his team when they host Sevilla in their final pre-season friendly match on Saturday.

Following a 3-0 victory over St Etienne last weekend, the Argentine was disappointed to see an underwhelming performance when they were beaten 4-0 by FC Augsburg at St Mary’s on Wednesday.

“Hopefully we can change the face in the next game, because we don’t have too much time, but I think for sure we cannot repeat the same situation on the pitch that we had (against Augsburg),” he added.

Pellegrino’s side kick off their league season against Swansea City at home on Aug. 12.

Despite purists who believe the beautiful game should never be sullied by video replay, it has arrived and isn’t going anywhere. Major League Soccer will start using it for every match, even the postseason, starting Saturday.

The Video Assistant Referee, VAR for short, was showcased on an international level during this summer’s Confederations Cup in Russia and the Under-20 World Cup in South Korea, with mixed results.

But MLS has been preparing for this moment for three years, determined to get it right.

“The idea is minimum interference for maximum benefit,” said veteran referee Howard Webb, who is overseeing the league’s implementation of video replay. “We’re not trying to change the way the game is played. We’re trying to enhance it. We’re trying to make it fairer. We’re trying to make sure the outcomes are right.”

Australia’s top-flight A-League used a version of video review on trial earlier this year, and the South Korean K-League Classic began working with it in July.

At least two other top-tier leagues will add a VAR soon. The German Bundesliga will debut video replay for the season opener between Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen on Aug. 18. The Italian Serie A will also introduce its version after adding goal-line technology last season.

For now, all eyes are on MLS and how it rolls out the VAR protocol. The league has not publicly stated its investment in video review.

“We’ve seen some really big players _ and make no mistake about it MLS is a big player in the global soccer world _ make the decision to take it on board, and undoubtedly we will be watched by the leagues that haven’t made the decision as well as the leagues that are doing it,” Webb said. “We are confident with our extensive preparation that what they’ll see will encourage them to do the same thing.”

Webb serves as manager of video assistant referee operations for the Professional Referee Organization, which oversees on-field officials in the U.S. and Canada. He’s got the credentials: He was a Premier League referee from 2003-14, and also worked the Champions League and World Cup finals in 2010. He also served as director of referees for the Saudi Arabian Football Federation.

Soccer’s rule-making body, the International Football Association Board, approved trials of video technology in March 2016. Internationally, live experiments are taking place in about 20 competitions this year, including the recent Confederations Cup, considered a test for the 2018 World Cup.

Implementation at the Confederations Cup drew criticism because of slow reviews that seemed to confuse players, coaches and fans. But FIFA concluded that video replay helped referees overturn six “game-changing decisions.” Calls made in 29 additional “major incidents” were confirmed correct on review.

“What fans have been waiting for over so many years is finally happening. This is a milestone tournament. Video Assistant Refereeing is the future of modern football.” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said after seeing the VAR at work in early-round matches in Russia.

It is expected that the IFAB will add video replay to the laws of the game within the next two years, and any competition meeting the requirements will be able to use it.

For the MLS program , a fifth member of the officiating crew _ the Video Assistant Referee _ will be at each MLS stadium and will monitor all video feeds of the game that are available, focusing on “potential clear and obvious errors or serious missed incidents” involving goals, penalty kicks, straight red cards and mistaken identity.

If a review is required, the VAR will alert the referee on the field, who will make a box gesture with his hands to indicate the VAR is examining a possible error. All final calls will lie with the head referee.

During 93 test games, the VAR checked 736 possible reviewable instances, resulting in just 28 reviews or about one every three games.

Real Salt Lake’s Brooks Lennon has seen VAR firsthand at the U-20 World Cup, where he was part of the U.S. team that advanced to the quarterfinals.

“There was one big call in the quarterfinal game where we had a goal scored against us and it was offside so they called it back,” Lennon said. “I think it’s good for the game and I think it will make right calls that are wrong.”

While MLS is considered something of a pioneer with the program at the professional level, the NCAA successfully used video replay dozens of times last season. A rules change last year allowed video replay in three situations: goals, player identification for disciplinary reasons, and to identify players involved in fights. Schools are allowed to use whatever equipment they see fit.

The technology was used in the men’s College Cup final between Stanford and Wake Forest.

“So the first year we put it in, it was right there for the whole world to see in the men’s Division I final,” said Ken Andres, the NCAA’s secretary-rules editor. “It was utilized to determine whether or not there was a goal. The ref determined on the field that there was no goal, (he) went to the video and the video was inconclusive. So the call of the field stands because we require indisputable visible evidence.”

Critics point mainly to issues involving communication because fans, players and coaches are unable to see what is going on while in the stadium. Some have suggested that video review be adapted to show what the refs are looking at on video scoreboards _ like other leagues, including the NBA.

Webb is pragmatic in understanding that the VAR protocol may have to be adapted. But the time has clearly come _ and the MLS can lead the way, he said.

“Every time there’s a big controversy in a game we have the same conversation: Why don’t we have video technology? Why can’t we use replays? Why can’t we bring the game up to date with the way other sports have used the technology?” he said. “It is a challenge in soccer because of how the game is played, that’s why it’s taken a lot of training and a lot of preparation.”

Stephen Curry heats up after slow start in pro golf debut,"Steph Curry got plenty of help along the 7,024-yard, par-70 course. (Source: AP) Steph Curry got plenty of help along the 7,024-yard, par-70 course. (Source: AP)

Stephen Curry pumped his right fist, raised his arms in the air with club in hand and gave a firm shoulder bump to caddie Jonnie West, his golf partner on road trips with the Golden State Warriors. After three bogeys in five holes of his professional golf debut, a birdie was worthy of celebration.

There was the animated, confident Steph that NBA fans know so well, the two-time league MVP finally feeling it and making the tough shots on the challenging course at TPC Stonebrae while competing in a tournament one step below the PGA Tour. With a bogey on the last hole, he had a respectable 4-over 74.

“It was an amazing experience, I’ve been looking forward to this since I found out and to finally hit my first shot in tournament play was a really, really nervous moment but it was everything I hoped for,” Curry said. “If you told me I was going to shoot 74 going into the first round I’d take that all day, every day. I’m pretty happy with it.”

Curry drew 300-plus fans to the Web.com Tour’s Ellie Mae Classic, where Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice has played a few times in the past.

The star point guard of the champion Warriors high-fived fans between holes on the picturesque course providing panoramic views overlooking San Francisco Bay, and he chatted with the other two in his threesome, Sam Ryder and defending champion Stephan Jaeger. Both will be on the PGA Tour next season.

Curry, who munched on a breakfast sandwich at the green of his first hole, missed badly on his opening tee shot. The drive landed off a hill and bounced perfectly into the cup holder of a golf cart.

Not quite as spot-on as those signature pregame tunnel shots at Oracle Arena or the jaw-dropping, buzzer-beating 3-pointers from way, way back.

“That’s probably a first on the tour. There was a golf cart just left of my target on hole No. 1 and it went right in the cup holder,” Curry said. “Not an ideal way to start with calling a rules official over after your first tee shot. I kind of settled in after that.”

On the 15th fairway, Curry leaned on West, a member of Golden State’s front office and son of Hall of Famer Jerry West. Jonnie West also is a member at this course.

Then Curry finished the par-5 15th by sinking a 5-foot, downhill birdie putt. He made par on No. 16 then survived a tee shot to the bunker and a near stumble climbing out of the sand on the par-4 18th and made about an 8-footer to save par.

That prompted a triumphant club tap to his shoe and Curry then held up the ball sporting a big grin.

“It was awesome,” West said. “He handled the nerves of this being his first time in this type of atmosphere pretty well.”

Curry began his round on the back nine and when his name was announced on the tee, “I could barely feel my hands, I had to try to take a deep breath,” he said.

He made the turn in 2 over. The top 65 and ties from the 156-player field will make the cut. Curry, playing on a sponsor exemption and one of three amateurs in the field, was outside the top 140 and five shots below the cut line as the first round was headed for a conclusion.

“I want to play better tomorrow. Now that I kind of got the jitters out hopefully that will happen and hit a couple more good shots and make a couple more putts,” he said.

With so many cameras clicking, cheers and whistles moments after he struck the ball and hundreds of supporters in No. 30 shirts and Warriors gear, this was no doubt a “Strength In Numbers” kind of day.

There would be no balls lost, either. Wherever his shots landed, a big crowd quickly gathered to get an up-close glimpse of one of basketball’s best. One of the biggest bargains in the NBA before, Curry was rewarded last month with a $201 million, five-year contract.

Playing his other sporting passion, Curry got plenty of help along the 7,024-yard, par-70 course. Those with homes along the course gathered in groups on decks to catch a hole.

On this day, it was Jaeger making a key assist down the stretch. Waiting at the tee box on their final hole, he took a basketball belonging to 14-year-old Erik Oswald from Southern California for Curry to sign and delivered it back to the giddy teen dressed in a chef’s hat who had followed his hoops hero all day.

“Unbelievable gallery out here,” Curry said, “hopefully that continues through the week.”

"Pro Kabaddi 2017: Nilesh Shinde catches Sandeep Narwal napping in ‘greatest PKL tackle’, watch video","Puneri Paltan beat Dabang Delhi in the PKL on Saturday. (Source: PKL) Puneri Paltan beat Dabang Delhi in the PKL on Saturday. (Source: PKL)

Kabaddi sees its share of ferocious tackles and raids with players fighting tooth and nail for each and every single point. Over the years, Pro Kabaddi has grown even more competitive and that can be understood with the rising number of teams in the tournament that has gone up to 12. The activity too gets intense as the season moves forward. One such instance came on the first day of the Nagpur leg of action in the PKL.

On the day that Bengaluru Bulls beat Tamil Thalaivas in a thriller which started off with a dominant start by the Bulls before Thalaivas got back in the second half to reduce the gap. In the end, Bengaluru won 32-31. In the second match of the day, Puneri Paltan got the better of Dabang Delhi in a 26-21 contest that was neck-and-neck till the half time break before Pune drew lead with steady play to win.

Even though they lost, Delhi, especially Nilesh Shinde, recorded one of the moments of the game or even made a mark for the moment of the league this season when he caught Sandeep Narwal napping in the eighth minute of the second half. As Narwal stepped up to go for a raid and try and eat up the 30 seconds allowed while hoping for a mistake by the Delhi players, he made a mistake of his own. As he moved backward, he lost focus and let the Shinde drop from his eyeline. The veteran noticed that and tip-toed his way to the midline and came back from behind to catch Narwal napping for one remarkable tackle.

The win took Puneri Paltan to the top of the Zone A standings with two wins in two matches while Dabang Delhi have won just once in three matches to be placed third.

"Skewed World Order, Dipped in Dystopia","Leila Leila

Book name: Leila

Author: Prayaag Akbar

Publisher: Simon and Schuster India

Pages: 207

Price: Rs 599

Prayaag Akbar’s debut novel Leila has at its heart an uncanny sense of urban architecture. Right from the tall, dark towers that make up its futuristic cover, it takes a sharp look at verticality as an idiom in our society, particularly in the context of upward mobility. Leila imagines the cruelty of a space where walls and towers have consequences beyond the physical; Akbar shows us the cognitive affects of living in a very precise kind of insularity in Leila and it’s hardly a surprise at a time when urban dystopias are making a big comeback across media.

In Appupen’s 2015 graphic novel Aspyrus, we’re shown a winged beast that lures/traps a forest boy chasing the dream of a vertical city. Ominous visuals gradually swallowing up residents also feature in JG Ballard’s High Rise (1975). Its opening lines have a chilling description of Dr. Robert Laing who, while eating a dog, reflects on unusual events in the apartments. The city is a spectre, where technocratic aspirations give way to a kind of madness deemed necessary for survival. Akbar’s work stands somewhere in between; it isn’t about technological doom as much it is about cultural policing.

The nomenclatures in Leila’s premise are significant. The city is ravaged by the armed (often without uniform) scrutiny of a “loose band of men”, known as the Repeaters. They’re the saviours of a pure community and work for the Council — another fishy group of the politically powerful. They ensure that localities remain “self-enclosing”, and real estate listings are like matrimonials: Brahmins-only, Yadavs-only and so on. Some years ago, the Repeaters had taken away the daughter of an inter-religious relationship, that of Shalini (the narrator), and her husband Riz (who is killed).

Shalini (a fairly privileged mother)’s, choice of “liberal” parenting in the East End comes under increasing suspicion as Naz (Riz’s brother) fails to convince her of the brand of conservatism he follows. Her fate is altered tragically soon. A party she throws is interrupted by the Repeaters who assert, “Purity for All”. There is no negotiation possible with this group. “Your daughter will be raised by the council. For her sake. We want an ordered society. Parents like you, she would never see the value in our way of life. Never fit in.”

A society reliant on building more boundaries between caste, class and gender, Leila’s story offers many nuances on what constitutes privilege and the layers of grey underneath it.

A widowed Shalini is an acute victim of surveillance systems. Ruthless guards and techniques make it mandatory for residents to seek permission for walking in and out of their restricted spaces for the most ordinary reasons. Women’s bodies and activities are inspected continuously; Shalini wonders at one point in the novel, “It’s still a surprise that Warden Khanna knows so much about my life. How does he keep track of every woman in the building?”

This rise in policing women finds due semblance in a recent urban dystopia called The Lesson by Sowmya Rajendran. Here, the control of women’s rights make fodder for reality television. In Leila too, honour resides in vaginas and fighting it can land you in the Purity camp, like it did for Sana, who dared to start a campaign against khatna (female genital mutilation). Sana brings an interesting point to light: although education for girls was available, women weren’t supposed to use it to empower themselves (“They want us in college, but they don’t want us to think. That is what’s dangerous”).

These paradoxes dominate the novel. It comes full circle on the subject of class prejudices with the character of Sapna, who fulfils her rise to a higher, “cultured” society by marrying a man under a council member. It is also hinted that she stole Shalini’s kid Leila and renamed her Lakshmi (a Hindu name), not to mention that now the Repeaters work at her beck and call. Sapna is our classic victim turned perpetrator but through her, we also get an insight into the kind of discrimination she faced at the hands of Shalini as a domestic help. In fact, Leila is about crores of women like Sapna, whose very act of dreaming is seen as a crime. Because even as inmates the privileged get such facilities, that are unthinkable for a working class inmate. “Our crime is to be born”, she says. In Akbar’s next, I would love to read a story from her narrative voice.

I am hopeful that selection for Bangladesh tour goes my way: Jackson Bird,"Jackson Bird has played eight Test matches so far for Australia. (Source: PTI) Jackson Bird has played eight Test matches so far for Australia. (Source: PTI)

30-year-old Australian pacer Jackson Bird is hopeful of making the cut for the upcoming Test series in Bangladesh. In a recent interview Bird, who hasn’t played competitive cricket since February 2017, said that he is keeping his fingers crossed and is hoping that selection goes his way.

Speaking to the Unplayable Podcastm Bird said, “”I haven’t really heard much about selection at this stage,” Bird told The Unplayable Podcast. “I’m assuming they’ll make a decision this week. Fingers crossed I do get the nod. “Hopefully selection goes my way, but it’s out of my hands.”

Earlier Bird’s selection for the Australia A team was cancelled when Australia decided to boycott the tour due to the pay dispute. Stating that the right decision was made, Bird said, “Yeah it hurts, it’s always nice to be playing cricket,” he said. “I haven’t played a game of cricket since the warm-up game against India A in February, so it’s been quite a while since I’ve played any competitive cricket. “It would have been nice to get another opportunity to push my claims for higher honours, but it was important from the playing group perspective that we stuck together with all the other players and did what was right for that. “So it was completely understandable why we didn’t go, but it was a bit disappointing that we couldn’t go over there and push our claims.”

Photographs from Kolkata: These colonial structures helped Calcutta rule over the subcontinent,"Today 70 years after the British left the country, Kolkata still houses some of the most extraordinary, elaborate architectural pieces that were once built by the Europeans with the intention to turn Calcutta into a Victorian delight.

In the late seventeenth century when the Mughals still held tight the reins of power in Bengal, Job Charnock, the staunchly loyal servant of the East India Company landed in a small swampy village called Sutanuti in Bengal. He was sent as an agent to set up a trading post for the English in the region. After much squabbling and heated negotiations with the Nawab and zamindars, Charnock established his factory at Sutanuti. A few years later, in 1690, he persuaded the company to set up its headquarters in Bengal, which by then was a thriving trading outpost, popular among the Armenians, Portuguese, Chinese, Jewish as also native traders and buzzing with their entrepreneurial spirit.

Thus lay the foundation of Calcutta that was marked by a distinct European flavour, thousands of Englishmen teeming across the streets and grand overarching neoclassical buildings sprouting all over the landscape to announce loud and clear the monopoly of English trading interests in the region. The economic enterprise of the Company soon found a means to establish force when Fort William was built and declared the seat of Presidency in 1706. Encouraged by the growing security provided by the Company, investments flowed in from Englishmen, other Europeans and also the native elite.

Located in the heart of present day Kolkata is a vast lake that is locally referred to as the Lal Dighi. Legend has it that the lake got its name from the fact that the Bengalis would celebrate Holi on its banks which would eventually result in the lake turning red. There are other theories though for its name, a popular one being the fact that the lake reflected the red walls of Fort William that lay right beside it. Back in the 18th and 19th centuries, Lal Dighi formed the nucleus around which the English built their administrative buildings, business houses, religious centres and recreation facilities.

Today 70 years after the British left the country, and 106 years years after they shifted capital from Calcutta to Delhi, the area still houses some of the most extraordinary, elaborate architectural pieces that were once built by the Europeans with the intention to turn Calcutta into a Victorian delight in contrast to the abode of the natives who they resolutely wanted to keep apart and intimidated. At present, these same works of British grandiosity are the places from which the Mamata Banerjee-led Bengal government exercises its administrative authority. Alternatively, several of these structures also house modern day banks and small business houses.

The Writers building

The northern side of Dalhousie square, right across the Lal Dighi, is the Writers’ building, the ornate red brick structure that for a long time has been perhaps the most important edifice in Kolkata. In 1776, when it was first built, the building turned out to be the first three-storeyed structure in the city, meant to be a dwelling place for junior officers (writers) of the company, typically those receiving a salary of less than Rs. 300 a month.

However, the original plan of the building was such that it lacked any kind of architectural beauty. A plain stuccoed building with a collegiate system of living is what best describes the original Writers building. In 1882 though, the structure underwent a massive change with baroque statuary being introduced at the top and a Graeco-Roman style of architecture being added.

When the British left the building became the house for the secretariat of the West Bengal government. At present though, the secretariat has been shifted to a building named Nabanna in Howrah and what remains is a torn down facade that is undergoing renovation since October 2013. Although a part of the structure still retains its beauty of Corinthian architecture, standing as a symbol of power.

The Central Telegraph Office

The British introduced telegraph services in the 1850s with the intention of asserting more command over the law and order system in the country. In retrospect, the telegraph services are perceived to be one of the most important contributions made by the British in India. The Central Telegraph Office, built by the British in 1873 for the sake of receiving mails from all across the world, is one of the most prominent surviving Victorian pieces of architecture in Kolkata. Located at the corner of Dalhousie square south and old court house street, the 120 feet dominating structure was the place where telegrams would be sorted out. In cases of the postal address being incomplete or the in case the addressee had died or could not be located, the letters would remain at the office and therefore the building came to be known as the ‘dead letters’ office.

When the original plan of the telegraph office was conceived, the idea was to have an Italian clock tower in place. However, even though the campanile tower did get built and still remains a noteworthy landmark in the area, it never came to have a clock.

Today, the exquisite piece of architecture continues to be used for storing and sorting out of mail. The building also serves as the Kolkata headquarters of the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), the state owned telecommunications services in India. The top floors have been converted into a guest house for postal employees.

The General Post office

The General Post Office, overlooking Dalhousie square east, is perhaps the finest looking buildings in Kolkata today. Fifty-two year old Kanhai has been selling envelopes right beside the structure for the past 30 years now. He says his business has gone down by 50 percent now. “The GPO still functions though, but mostly for the purpose of insurance and savings,” he says.

At the time the imposing piece of domed architecture was built in 1868, an elaborate machinery for postal services was being managed by the British in India. The ornate architecture cost the British a lofty sum of Rs. 6,30,510 and was particularly noted for its domed roof and the 28 corinthian pillars. The double storeyed building housed the offices of the Postmaster General and the Presidency Postmaster, both of which have now been shifted.

Today, the landmark building still serves as the post office in Kolkata but also houses a postal museum showcasing a large collection of artefacts and stamps.

The Great Eastern Hotel

Currently called the Lalit Great Eastern Hotel, located in Old Court House Street, is now a symbol new India’s rich and elite. In the mid nineteenth century though, the hotel was a creation of colonial pomp, popularly referred to as the “jewel in the East.” It was opened by David Wilson in 1840 and was named “Auckland Hotel” after the then governor-general of India. Colloquially though, the hackney-carriage drivers around the hotel used to refer to it as “Wilson saheb ka hotel”, the name that was used to describe the building by Rabindranath Tagore in his autobiography as well.

The name “Great Eastern Hotel” was acquired in 1915. In its hey day, the hotel had housed some great personalities of the world like Nikita Khrushchev, Mark Twain and Elizabeth II. After independence too the hotel had retained its past glamour. Things started deteriorating for this massive piece of colonial construction during the Naxal era in Bengal.

During the Naxal disturbance in Bengal in the 1970s, the hotel was taken over by the state and was later sold to a private group, the Lalit Hotels, Palaces and Resorts in 2005. Consequently, it went through a large amount of renovation and later opened in 2013 as both a heritage structure and a hotel for the rich and wealthy of India.

St. John’s church

One of the first public spaces built by the English East India Company in Calcutta, the St. John’s church was initially the Anglican cathedral of Calcutta till 1847 when it shifted to St. Paul’s Cathedral. Built in 1787, the foundation stone of the cathedral was laid by governor-general Warren Hastings. Popularly, the edifice was also called “pathure girja” (church made of stone) on account of the fact that it was built using brick and stone in a neoclassical architectural style.

While the church was once the prime religious spot for Company officials and other Europeans to assemble who would gather in hundreds in the church during mass services, today a mere 10-12 families frequent the church. Nonetheless, the church remains a popular heritage spot in the city, also reputed for housing the mausoleum of Job Charnock.

Apart from the structures mentioned, central Kolkata today contains several such architectural delights which were once bustling with European administrative, economic and recreational activities. Today, as the Bengal economy sees a dismal low, Kolkata continues to derive pride from a glorious past, thriving with trade activities and imperial pomp. As noted by politician, historian and writer, Evan Cotton in his reputed work, “Calcutta old and new,” “could we only shut our eyes and people Calcutta with the denizens of a century and quarter ago, what a procession of heroes and heroines would file before us.”

"Dialysis, some other health services cost more under GST: Union Health Ministry","The Ministry of Health has also appointed a nodal officer for the GST and is working to disseminate information to all stakeholders and address their concern. The Ministry of Health has also appointed a nodal officer for the GST and is working to disseminate information to all stakeholders and address their concern.

People may have to shell out more for availing of some of the healthcare services such as dialysis, pacemaker implantation, support devices in orthopaedics and cancer treatment due to levying of the GST, the Union Health Ministry has said. The GST cell of the Ministry has said this on its website in answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the Goods and Services Tax and its impact on the health sector.

However, in reply to another question, the ministry has said that life-saving drugs, healthcare services, and medical devices would continue to be tax-free under the GST. “Dialysis (5 to 12 per cent), pacemaker (5.5 to 12-18 per cent), support devices in orthopaedics (5 to 12 per cent), and all support devices for cancers except blood cancer (5 to 7-12 per cent) are the services that will face increased taxation due to GST,” the ministry said in reply to the question as to what are the services likely to cost more due to the GST.

According to a government official, diagnostic kits, except for those used in the detection of Hepatitis and radiology machines, will come under the high-end ambit of 28 per cent tax and thus diagnosis will get costlier. As far as medical tourism is concerned, with the rollout of the GST, the cost of insurance, pharmaceuticals and international travel is expected to come down which would result in better prospects for medical tourism in the country. The Ministry of Health has also appointed a nodal officer for the GST and is working to disseminate information to all stakeholders and address their concern.

"Not yet a great club, PSG sign big coup with Neymar","Neymar will turn out for PSG from this season. (Source: AP File) Neymar will turn out for PSG from this season. (Source: AP File)

For many years, Paris Saint-Germain was synonymous with huge under-achievement on the field, overt racism in the stands and fan violence outside the stadium. By signing Neymar for a world record transfer fee, PSG and its wealthy Qatari owners have definitively closed that chapter of the club’s history. Out goes the old image of working-class Paris, and in comes a new era where glitz, glamour and money count for everything.

To secure the services of the Barcelona forward, PSG splashed 222 million euros ($262 million) _ double the previous world record transfer of 105 million euros (then $116 million) paid last year by Manchester United for France midfielder Paul Pogba. Yet that level of spending, though breathtaking, is not as surprising as it first seems.

Since Qatar Sports Investments took over PSG in 2011 with the aim of turning it into a world-class club, the owners have made it clear they are willing to spend big.

In the summer of 2011, QSI signaled its intentions by signing Javier Pastore for 42 million euros from Italian club Palermo. The spree that followed included Thiago Motta (11.5 million euros), Thiago Silva (42 million), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (21 million), Ezequiel Lavezzi (29 million), Marco Verratti (12 million), Lucas Moura (40 million), Edinson Cavani (64.5 million) and Angel Di Maria (63). That’s a whopping 325 million euros ($385 million).

While the willingness to shatter the world transfer record is clear enough, Neymar’s arrival is harder to understand from a sporting standpoint.

Following Ibrahimovic’s departure to Manchester United last summer, Cavani thrived as PSG’s main striker _ finishing the season as the French league’s top scorer and bagging a remarkable 49 goals in 50 games across all competitions.

With Neymar joining coach Unai Emery’s system, it remains to be seen whether Cavani will be able to reproduce those impressive figures, especially if the Brazil forward, who can play on both wings, is used in a more central position.

Neymar’s arrival has also left many observers wondering why the club hasn’t invested in other positions, since PSG’s attacking force was clearly not a problem last season.

A pair of top-class defensive midfielders to help protect a shaky back four that conceded six goals to Neymar’s former team during a dismal Champions League night last season would seem to be a far more pressing need. Replacing the error-prone Kevin Trapp with a star goalkeeper might also have been a better investment for a club that has made winning the Champions League a very public objective.

However, as a public relations exercise, hiring Neymar definitely has a lot of benefits.

Along with selling tens of thousands of Neymar Jr. jerseys, the Brazilian’s arrival will help club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi in his efforts to promote the slick image of a fashionable club that is determined to succeed on the world stage.

Off the pitch, QSI has helped to rid the Parc des Princes stadium of its most violent supporters and has brought sporting stability as well as top quality players to PSG.

Those improvements have come at a cost for the team’s fans, who have seen the price of season tickets double over the past six years, with holders being asked to pay extra to watch Champions League matches.

A number of protests have been held in recent seasons by longstanding supporters who suspect the club of trying to attract a wealthier demographic to the Parc des Princes.

Those voices have been listened to, and the gradual return of PSG’s hard-core fans last season has greatly improved the match-day atmosphere.

To repay that faith, the team now has to live up to expectations in Europe, after several years of underachievement. Despite the money being lavished on the squad, it has yet to match the feats of the PSG team that reached the Champions League semifinals in 1995 and won the now defunct European Cup Winners’ Cup the following season.

Signing Neymar has certainly been a spectacular media coup. The challenge now is for him to transform PSG from a very good French team to a great European club.

"Rodrigo Duterte’s “Build, Build, Build” plans hit Philippine peso","Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (REUTERS/Ezra Acayan/File Photo) Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (REUTERS/Ezra Acayan/File Photo)

Philippine construction firm Teravera Corp is planning to raise a fourth dollar loan in a year, after borrowing around $2.5 million to buy dozens of excavators, road rollers and dump trucks from China, South Korea and Japan. Teravera is one of hundreds of local builders contributing to a surge in capital goods imports that has turned the country’s current account surplus into a deficit and knocked the peso down to 11-year lows against the dollar last month.

While the peso’s dip is raising eyebrows in a region where the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit are flirting with multi-year highs, it’s come mainly because the Philippines, one of the world’s fastest growing economies, has been enjoying a construction boom.

Besides private construction, companies like Teravera are confident of more contracts coming from the government’s drive to upgrade its dilapidated roads, railways, ports and airports, which have been a drag on the economy. “We have seen the government’s list of projects and they are bidding them out early, that is why we have been procuring equipment,” said Teravera vice-president Aldrin Cabrera. He said the company is confident of getting subcontracted to build a long-delayed four-lane toll road project on the southern part of Luzon island later this year, as it is one of bigger players in the area.

Foreign and local businesses have been frustrated with former President Benigno Aquino’s Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, which often took a long time to kick off because of red tape. The game changer is that President Rodrigo Duterte, who took office just over a year ago, has decided that all projects will be entirely funded by the government, which his economic managers say should simplify the process. The controversial leader says he plans a $180 billion “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure campaign in his six-year term.

Duterte has already approved the auction of 21 projects worth $16 billion, including the overhaul of Manila’s shabby airport and a railway line on Mindanao island in the south. Other projects include upgrading ports, roads, rail links and irrigation.

Despite security problems linked to the spread of Islamic State militancy on Mindanao and Duterte’s bloody war on drugs, investors have welcomed the commitments, but say they need to see progress on the ground.

“We see a high degree of commitment and seriousness in the executive branch and probability of sufficient financing…not for every project to be completed on schedule but for very substantial and significant progress,” said John Forbes, senior adviser at the American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines.

“However, the capacity of the bureaucracy to process a huge volume of projects …(is) untested,” he added. “The Philippines is not China, where bulldozers rumble through neighbourhoods at the government’s command.”

Worst-Performing Economy

To meet existing and anticipated pick-up in demand, imports of capital goods, mainly infrastructure-related, have risen more than 7 percent in the first five months of the year from the same period of 2016 to $12.1 billion. For the first time in 15 years, the Philippines is expecting its 2017 current account balance to be in a deficit of $600 million.

The peso is Asia’s worst performing currency this year, hitting lows close to 51 per dollar last month. At the market close in Manila on Friday, the peso traded 50.16 to the dollar, down 0.9 percent in 2017. Policymakers are often reminded of the Asian financial crisis 20 years ago whenever external balances weaken, and most economies in the region have built solid surpluses to avoid a similar episode.

In the Philippines, Duterte’s administration dismisses such warnings. “We are importing equipment because we are a developing country trying to make up for past neglect on infrastructure,” Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said last month. Central bank deputy governor Diwa Guinigundo says the weak peso boosts the purchasing power of Filipinos receiving $2 billion a month in remittances and, longer-term, will improve export demand. But foreign investors are more cautious.

“Until investors feel the imports work through the economy and push it to a higher growth path, the market’s focus would be on a deterioration in the balance of trade,” said Joey Cuyegkeng, senior economist at ING. “We expect gradual (peso) weakening.” Near term, around $40 billion in yearly inflows from outsourcing contracts and from millions of citizens working overseas mean the trade gap is covered. But Cuyegkeng says in two years time those inflows would barely cover the gap.

Duterte has promised to usher in a “golden age of infrastructure” by raising annual spending to 7 percent of GDP from less than 3 percent previously and above the 5 percent average of neighbouring countries.

Encouraged by better budget planning and a crackdown on red tape, Nomura’s economists estimate 90 percent of the money lined up for infrastructure would be spent. On the ground, builders share the view. “Some of the projects may sound ambitious, but they are needed. They will happen and it is just a question of time,” said Edgar Saavedra, president and chief operating officer of building company Megawide Construction Corp.

Ethiopia lifts emergency rule imposed last October after months of unrest,"Measures initially imposed under the declaration included granting powers to security services to stop and search suspects and to search homes without court authorization. (Source: Google Maps) Measures initially imposed under the declaration included granting powers to security services to stop and search suspects and to search homes without court authorization. (Source: Google Maps)

Ethiopia on Friday lifted a state of emergency imposed last October following months of protests that killed hundreds of people. More than 29,000 people were arrested during the period and nearly 8,000 of them are on trial for taking part in the violence, Defence Minister Siraj Fegessa said. The unrest was provoked by a development scheme for the capital Addis Ababa and turned into broader anti-government demonstrations over politics and human rights abuses. It included attacks on businesses, many of them foreign-owned, including farms growing flowers for export.

“The country’s stability is in far better shape. In some areas where security issues remain, local security forces have the capacity to restore order,” Fegessa said in a report read in parliament. Siraj said nearly 29,000 people were arrested in the provinces of Oromiya, Amhara and SNNP, as well as Addis Ababa during the period. “7,737 of them are currently on trial over charges of taking part in violent and terrorist acts during the unrest,” he said.

Measures initially imposed under the declaration included granting powers to security services to stop and search suspects and to search homes without court authorization. Another rule barred diplomats from travelling beyond a 40 km (25 miles) radius of the capital without permission. There was also a dusk-to-dawn curfew on access to economic installations, some infrastructure and factories for unauthorized people.

Those restrictions were eased in March but Addis Ababa maintained a ban that stopped citizens from having any contact with opposition groups branded as terrorist movements. Ethiopia has designated five groups, including two armed secessionist groups, as terrorist organizations. Another directive barring the “preparation, distribution and exhibition of material that could incite chaos” was also retained in March.

The violence in Oromiya, the largest and most populous region which surrounds Addis Ababa, and to a lesser extent in the Amhara province north of Addis Ababa, put a shadow over a nation where a state-led industrial drive has created one of Africa’s fastest growing economies.

The government also often faces international criticism and opposition to its authoritarian approach to development. In April, a government-sanctioned investigation said 669 people had been killed in the violence.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein has called on Ethiopia to allow his agency to investigate abuse claims.

"US, India, Japan partnership for peace in region: US commander","Representational Image Representational Image

The growing partnership between the US, India and Japan is to keep peace in the Indo-Asia Pacific region, a top American commander has said, dismissing as “unfortunate” concerns raised by China over multilateral drills, including the Malabar naval exercise. “I say our partnerships stand on their own merits. Deepening military cooperation between these four great democracies (the US, Japan, Australia and India) is based on shared values and shared concerns,” US Pacific Command (PACOM) Commander Admiral Harry Harris said.

In Malabar, he said, the US, Japan and India continued growing their partnership to keep the peace throughout the Indo-Asia-Pacific. “And in Talisman Saber, Japan and the US joined our war-fighting mates in Australia,” Harris said.

“Unfortunately, there are some who question the motives for the increasingly cooperative relationship between the US, Japan, Australia and India,” Harris said in an apparent reference to the Chinese objections to such multilateral exercises. India, Japan and the US last month held Malabar naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal amid China’s growing assertiveness in the Indian Ocean region.

Harris said that China’s desire to pick and choose when it comes to international law demonstrates the kind of nation China is. “To me, China is a strategic competitor for the United States – and to Japan, for that matter,” he said.

Harris said he has repeatedly emphasised that they can’t allow the areas where they disagree with China to impact their ability to make progress in the areas where they do agree. “All Indo-Asia-Pacific nations, including the United States, should use smart power and try to cooperate with China where possible,” he said.

“For PACOM, my goal remains to convince China that its best future comes from peaceful cooperation and meaningful participation in the current rules-based international order,” Harris added.

"UN reports 251 killings in DRC’s Kasai, 62 children among dead","Uruguayan peacekeepers serving in the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) patrol in their armoured personnel carrier in Tshimbulu near Kananga, the capital of Kasai-central province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, March 11, 2017.

(Source: REUTERS/Aaron Ross, file)

The UN today detailed more than 250 “extrajudicial or targeted killings” in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Kasai region from mid-March to mid-June, counting dozens of children among the dead. The findings, based on interviews with refugees from Kasai who had fled to Angola, blamed state agents for the murders of seven children.

The refugees gave harrowing accounts of the violence in the region, which the UN warned had taken on “an increasing and disturbing ethnic dimension.” Victims recounted mutilations, including of a seven-year-old boy whose fingers were cut off, and an attack on a hospital in the village of Cinq where 90 people were killed, some because they were too injured to escape a raging fire.

Aside from government troops, the UN blamed a state-backed militia called the Bana Mura as well as the anti-government Kamuina Nsapu militia for a range of atrocities. “Survivors have spoken of hearing the screams of people being burned alive, of seeing loved ones chased and cut down, of themselves fleeing in terror”, the United Nations human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said in a statement.

A team of UN investigators “was able to confirm that between 12 March and 19 June some 251 people were the victims of extrajudicial and targeted killings”, the report said. “These included 62 children, of which 30 were aged under eight,” it added. Regarding the children murdered, the UN said seven were killed by members of the army (FARDC) or the national intelligence service, while six died at the hands of the rebel Kamuina Nsapu. The Bana Mura militia members blamed for the deaths of 49 minors.

“Some of the violations and abuses committed in the Kasais may amount to crimes under international law,” the UN said in a statement. The violence in Kasai erupted last September after the death in clashes of a tribal chieftain, known as the Kamwina Nsapu, who rebelled against the authority of President Joseph Kabila’s regime in Kinshasa and its local representatives.

The killing sparked violence that has escalated, including gross alleged violations of human rights such as extrajudicial killings, rapes, torture and the use of child soldiers. In less than a year, the violence has claimed more than 3,300 lives, according to a tally by the influential Roman Catholic Church, and displaced 1.4 million people.

Around 80 mass graves have been uncovered in the region. Kabila’s reluctance to organise elections has heightened tensions across the country, while the UN rights office has blasted his government for not mounting serious investigations into the Kasai crisis.

Awards panel ignores foreign coaches yet again for Dronacharya,"A couple of days ago, a committee led by Virender Sehwag recommended Khushbir Kaur for the Arjuna Award. (Source: AP) A couple of days ago, a committee led by Virender Sehwag recommended Khushbir Kaur for the Arjuna Award. (Source: AP)

A couple of days ago, a committee led by Virender Sehwag recommended Khushbir Kaur for the Arjuna Award. Kaur has emerged as one of the best race-walkers in the country and was the first woman athlete to win an Asian Games medal in 2014.

Much of her recent success was attributed to Russian coach Alexander Artsybashev, who has been with the team since 2011. However, on Saturday, he was ignored for the Dronacharya Award even as the sports ministry-appointed committee recommended the late national coach Ramakrishnan Gandhi for the award. Gandhi was the coach of Gurmeet Singh, who became the first Indian to win the Asian 20km gold last year. Gandhi and Artsybashev are credited for triggering a turnaround in Indian race-walking, which has grown in leaps over the last four years.

But the country’s policy to ignore foreign coaches for national sports awards continued as the committee recommended Heeranand Kataria (kabaddi) and Paralympics coach Satyanarayana for the Dronacharya Award apart from Gandhi. Artsybashev wasn’t the only foreign coach who was ignored.

It is learnt that the sports ministry was keen on rewarding wrestling coach Vladimer Mestvirishvili and shooting coach Heinz Reinkemeier. The duo has been ignored for Dronacharya despite playing a stellar role in Sushil Kumar, Yogeshwar Dutt and Abhinav Bindra winning Olympic medals. Even though they were not nominated by their federations, the ministry chose to propose their names.

As per the rules, the sports ministry can recommend two names for the award. According to sources, the government was keen to ensure that Vladimer was feted, considering he ensured three wrestling medals (Sushil’s bronze and silver at Beijing and London Games along with Yogeshwar’s bronze in 2012).

However, the Pullela Gopichand-led Dronacharya awards panel decided against it. “The committee was unanimous in its opinion that foreign coaches get paid well. So these awards are more valuable for the Indian coaches. Hence, the committee did not consider Vladimer and Heinz for the award,” a source said.

Meanwhile, women’s chief wrestling coach Kuldeep Malik’s nomination was debated but the panel did not vote in his favour. Malik claimed he had coached Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik. However, another coach – Mandeep Singh — claimed he was Sakshi’s coach since childhood and hence, he should be given the Dronacharya.

Neymar leaves Barcelona without its heir to Lionel Messi,"Neymar flourished alongside Messi for four seasons, and everyone in Barcelona. (Source: AP) Neymar flourished alongside Messi for four seasons, and everyone in Barcelona. (Source: AP)

Barcelona is facing an uncertain future without Lionel Messi’s heir apparent.

Neymar flourished alongside Messi for four seasons, and everyone in Barcelona _ executives, players, fans _ counted on the 25-year-old Brazil striker to eventually become the team’s leader after he signed a contract extension last year through 2021.

That plan was blown away on Thursday when Neymar’s astonishing 222 million euro ($262 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain was completed after his release clause was triggered _ doubling the world record for a soccer transfer.

The departure of Neymar leaves Barcelona in the position of having a lot of extra cash and the clear need to shore up an aging team that has lost its second-best player and its projected star for years to come.

Neymar is poised to become an even better player in Paris than the one who has dazzled Camp Nou with his lightning-quick feet and flair for beautiful goals.

Barcelona’s other top players, however, are all eyeing the twilight of their careers. While he still hasn’t lost a step, Messi is 30 and entering his 14th season. Striker Luis Suarez is also 30, and midfielder Andres Iniesta has reached 33 and is in the final year of his contract.

Iniesta considered Neymar irreplaceable, no matter how much money the club would get in exchange.

“I can’t see how having 200 or 300 million (euros) is more beneficial than counting on Neymar,” Iniesta said last weekend amid growing speculation about PSG’s interest. “He is one of the best players in the world and gives us so much.”

Neymar’s departure after four seasons and 10 trophies breaks up one of the most potent strike units ever. Neymar and Messi were joined by Suarez in the summer of 2014, and the three became almost unstoppable, scoring a Spanish record for a trio of 122 goals in a season to lead Barcelona to a rare sweep of the Champions League, Spanish league and Copa del Rey titles.

Barcelona’s identity is based on a 4-3-3 formation with a trio of attackers up front. So the club’s first priority will likely be to sign another top forward. Spanish media reports link Barcelona to Atletico Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann and Borussia Dortmund’s Ousmane Dembele.

Barcelona could also be tempted to enter the sweepstakes for Monaco’s teenage striker Kylian Mbappe, who is supposed to be on the agenda of fierce rival Real Madrid.

But the exit of Neymar offers a chance to new coach Ernesto Valverde to use his preferred 4-2-3-1 system, which he succeeded with at Athletic Bilbao and other clubs.

The luxury of having three superb strikers occasionally left Barcelona exposed at the back last season, when it outscored Madrid in the league but lost key matches that also contributed to an early exit from the Champions League quarterfinals.

Barcelona had already been after PSG midfielder Marco Verratti as it struggles to maintain its signature dominance in midfield two years after Xavi Hernandez’s departure. Other rumors point to the Catalan club luring away Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho or Juventus playmaker Paulo Dybala.

Barcelona will have to pay inflated prices for players after PSG blew open the market, and potential sellers know they have oodles of cash. The club will also have to face the truth that, at his best, Neymar is only comparable to Messi and Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo. The market closes at the end of the month.

Barcelona faced a similar situation in 2000 when it infamously sold Portugal midfielder Figo to Madrid. It spent the money it received on Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit. What followed was Madrid’s “galactico” reign while Barcelona took five years before winning another Liga.

Former club president Joan Gaspart who sold Figo defended current president Josep Bartomeu against criticism that he let Neymar get away.

“The board is not to blame for Neymar’s exit,” Gaspart told Marca Radio. “They did all they could to keep him. Neymar got around them just like Figo got around me.”

Neymar’s departure comes with Barcelona already playing catch-up with Madrid for the first time in a decade. Madrid has won three Champions League titles in the last four years and claimed its first Spanish league title in five years in May.

Madrid defender Sergio Ramos said recently that Madrid would get a boost by simply not having to play against Neymar.

“That is one less problem for us because in the key matches they won’t have the player who made the difference,” Ramos said.

Madrid will get its first shot at the post-Neymar Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup on Aug. 13 and 16.

Barcelona can take heart that the last time the two powerhouses met Neymar was suspended. Messi scored two goals anyway for a memorable 3-2 win at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Barcelona can only hope that Messi can do it again, and maybe for years to come, without his No. 1 sidekick.

"US warns against ‘staggering’ leaks, vows crackdown","President Donald Trump has repeatedly fumed about “illegal leaks” and even lashed out publicly at Sessions last week for taking what he called a “very weak” position on the issue.

US Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday vowed a tough crackdown on people revealing classified or sensitive national security information, threatening to jail leakers and branding such illicit acts a betrayal to fellow Americans. President Donald Trump has repeatedly fumed about “illegal leaks” and even lashed out publicly at Sessions last week for taking what he called a “very weak” position on the issue. Under pressure, and with some saying his job could be on the line, Sessions responded.

“I strongly agree with the president and condemn in the strongest terms the staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our government to protect this country,” Sessions told a press conference. Four people have already been charged with “unlawfully disclosing” classified material or concealing contacts with federal officers, he said. The number of active leak investigations this year has tripled compared with the tally before Trump took office, Sessions added. “We are taking a stand. This culture of leaking must stop,” he said.

Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, joining Sessions, issued his own tough warning to would-be leakers and described such revelations as “betraying” the American people. “Understand this: If you improperly disclose classified information, we will find you,” he said. “We will investigate you, we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.” The announcement comes after six months of political intrigue and open feuding in the White House, which has manifested itself in a torrent of damaging revelations to the media.

It also follows a leak that was unusual even by the standards of this administration — the publication by The Washington Post of the contents of private phone calls between Trump and foreign leaders. The newspaper published the full transcripts Thursday of conversations the Republican billionaire leader held in January with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Sessions, while not addressing specifics of the transcripts, signalled his anger over the revelations which apparently came from inside the White House, saying “no government can be effective” when its leaders’ discussions of sensitive matters are released. The attorney general issued a not-so-veiled threat to the media, saying that while the administration has respect for the press, “it is not unlimited.”

“They cannot place lives at risk with impunity,” he added. “We must balance the press’s role with protecting our national security.”

The Observatory says two of the militant group’s fighters were killed and several others were wounded.

The Ibaa news agency, which is linked to al-Qaeda, says the blast in the village of Urum al-Kubra, west of the northern city of Aleppo, left “several martyrs” and wounded people.

The explosion comes amid rising tension in northern Syria between the al-Qaeda-linked group and other factions, including more moderate rebels.

Four years on and Ram is back in the ring. The 34-year-old led the Mumbai franchise in the ongoing Super Boxing League (SBL). But it’s outside the ring where he is piecing his life together. In late 2014, Ram started a boxing academy at Public College in Patiala’s Samana village. After initial apprehensions, a few kids from the village started training under him. Today, the academy has produced professional boxers, state and national champions and houses hopefuls from other states and even overseas.

“Earlier this year, Leo Singh, a professional boxer from Birmingham, came to train with us. He heard my name because we are doing something good, right?”

Another of his proud proteges is Kuldeep Singh. Ram says he has guided the labourer-turned-national champion-turned professional boxer since 2002. As luck would have it, the two faced off in SBL, with Kuldeep winning the contest. Years haven’t been kind to Ram, who admits lack of training along with a thyroid problem have left him slower in the ring even if “SBL me sabse badiya body meri thi.” With plans to branch into MMA, Ram says he has to fit in personal training between academy hours. The defeat in SBL doesn’t bother Ram though, for Kuldeep learned the tricks of pro boxing from him.

While it began with a few donated shoes, the academy now has a physiotherapist, two sponsors, and 16 punching bags; but no chair – “agar coach baithega toh bachche kya train karenge.”

A big chunk of the Rs14, 000 he gets paid by the college goes towards legal expenses. Some of it is used to help out the kids. “I take them to the meets myself. At other times, it’s the jalebis and juice. When they are here, they are my kids. I have seen this early struggle. Boxing ameer, AC me baithne waale toh karte nahi hain. Gareebi se aate hain log.”

According to Ram, some government coaches tried to scare away parents, claiming he would turn the kids into drug addicts. “Results speak for themselves. And now that I am getting results, people remember I have represented India. They remember I stayed in Vijender’s room for eight years. How I supported him while he was slowly climbing up the ranks.”

Ram recounts the day he walked 75km to join Vijender for a practice session and the langar he organised for 300 people when his friend won the bronze medal in Beijing.

“Duniya matlab ki, zamana paise ka,” he repeats, before quickly trying to mask the bitterness. “Dhabba us pe bhi to lag hi gaya tha. The man who has won laurels for his country was also dragged unnecessarily in the case.”

Contact between the two has been limited to Ram ‘liking’ the occasional picture on Facebook. But he will be watching Saturday’s fight night – though less for Vijender and more for fellow pro Neeraj Goyat.

“Everybody hears the name Vijender and think that he is the one who brought professional boxing to India. But Neeraj Goyat had turned pro much before and has had more experience on the circuit. Neeraj bhai has also helped me out a lot, and has always treated me with a lot of respect,” says Ram. “I still pray that Vijender wins and makes India proud. But aap sab log Vijender ko hi uthaate hain bas,” he sniggers.

"Handcuffed, face down and shot, Yemeni executed for child rape and murder","A police officer opens fire at Muhammad al-Maghrabi, 41, who was convicted of raping and murdering a three-year-old girl, in Sanaa, Yemen July 31, 2017.

A man convicted of raping and murdering a three-year-old girl was executed in the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Monday in front of hundreds of onlookers, the first public execution there since 2009. “Security was very tight, because authorities were fearing a revenge attack by armed men from the Bani Matar tribe to which the girl’s family belong,” said Reuters photographer Khaled Abdullah who witnessed the scene.

The police van transporting Muhammad al-Maghrabi, 41, to Sanaa’s Tahrir Square was escorted by five police patrol vehicles. The execution drew a large number of onlookers, some perched up telegraph poles and many watching from rooftops. The crowd started to shout “Allah is the greatest” when Maghrabi arrived.

“The man was escorted from the van to the middle of the square, and then the place turned to a complete chaos and I fought for a position to take pictures,” Abdullah said.

“He tried to talk to the executioner, a police officer who was calmly smoking a cigarette as he stood next to him before pointing his AK-47 to his back from a very close distance.

“Soon he fired around four shots, and people realized that it was done, they rushed to the place and tried to take the body, but the police were able to take the body to the van and drove through the crowd out of the square.”

Yahya al-Matari, the father of the murder victim, Rana al-Matari, told reporters after the execution he was satisfied. “This is the first day in my life,” he said. “I am relieved now.”

Yemen has been devastated by more than two years of civil war between its Saudi-backed government and Houthi fighters who seized parts of the country in 2014 and 2015.

US crushes nearly two tons of ivory in New York Central Park,"US officials destroyed nearly two tons of carved illegal ivory worth USD 8-10 million in New York’s Central Park today to denounce poaching that kills nearly 100 elephants a day in Africa. On a brilliant summer’s day with Manhattan’s skyscrapers visible above the trees, decorative objects were placed on a conveyor belt and sent into a crusher, sending plumes of dust into the air to cheers.

The haul, which was the result of three years of hard investigative work in New York state, represents ivory from around 100 elephants. John Calvelli, a senior official from the Wildlife Conservation Society, which helped organize the event, said 96 elephants are killed in Africa on average each day or around 35,000 a year.

The event was the third time authorities have staged a public ivory crushing in the United States since 2013. “We’re sending a message to the rest of the world. Stop buying ivory and lets save these elephants,” Calvelli told AFP.

US federal officials, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance and New York Republican Congressman Dan Donovan were among the hundreds of supporters who attended the event. “It’s not ok to be selling these goods anymore and perpetuating and prolonging the agony of the situation,” said British rocker Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac fame, who turned out to lend his support.

Speaking to AFP, he denounced the rate of elephant killing as “beyond imagination.” “If you’re dealing in the proceeds of wildlife crime, if you are trading ivory, you’re going to get prosecuted and it’s not going to be pretty,” Vance told supporters at the event.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation carried out the crushing of tusks, trinkets, statues and jewelry. The international trade in ivory was outlawed in 1989. China remains the largest market, with the United States in second place.

Beijing has said it will ban all ivory trade and processing by the end of 2017, a move that conservationists have hailed a “game changer.” Calvelli said the three largest markets in the United States — California, Hawaii and New York — have fundamentally closed in recent years.

Elephant tusks are highly prized, particularly in Asia, where they are carved into ivory statuettes and jewelry. The WWF estimates that in the early 20th century, there may have been as many as three to five million African elephants, but says there are now around 415,000.

US to probe Harvard’s admission process: Report,"The US Justice Department will probe allegations that Harvard University discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its admission process. (File Photo) The US Justice Department will probe allegations that Harvard University discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its admission process. (File Photo)

The US Justice Department will probe allegations against the prestigious Harvard University that the Ivy League institution discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its admission process. The allegations were levelled in 2015 against the university by a coalition of 64 Asian-American groups, including four Indian-American organisations.

The New York Times reported that the Trump administration intended to increase the Justice Department’s efforts to target universities whose admission policies it deemed discriminatory against white applicants, a report in The Harvard Crimson, a student newspaper of the university, said.

The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will investigate the allegations.

The Crimson report said that the university has repeatedly and emphatically denied allegations that it uses racial quotas in its admissions process.

A Justice Department spokesperson said the investigation would focus on a single complaint filed in 2015 accusing Harvard in particular of discriminating against Asian-Americans in its undergraduate admissions processes, the Crimson report said.

“The posting sought volunteers to investigate one administrative complaint filed by a coalition of 64 Asian-American associations in May 2015 that the prior administration left unresolved,” Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement yesterday.

“This Department of Justice has not received or issued any directive, memorandum, initiative, or policy related to university admissions in general,” the statement said.

The complaint had been filed on behalf of Asian-American students “who, because of their race, have been unfairly rejected by Harvard College because of such unlawful use of race in the admissions process, and/or who seek the opportunity to apply for admission without being discriminated against because of their race”.

Among the 64 organisations were four Indian-American community associations — American Society of Engineers of Indian Origin, BIT Sindri Alumni Association of North India, Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin-Los Angeles Chapter and National Federation of Indian American Associations.

The Department of Education had later dismissed the complaint saying it was similar to an ongoing and separate federal lawsuit filed against Harvard.

“To become leaders in our diverse society, students must have the ability to work with people from different backgrounds, life experiences and perspectives. Harvard remains committed to enrolling diverse classes of students,” Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane said.

“Harvard’s admissions process considers each applicant as a whole person, and we review many factors, consistent with the legal standards established by the US Supreme Court”.

The Class of 2021 is 22.2 per cent Asian-American, a record high for the university, the Crimson report added.

"Iran’s Rouhani, embarking on second term, accuses Trump over nuclear deal","Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi) Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who was sworn-in for a second term on Saturday, has accused the United States of trying to undermine Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers, telling President Donald Trump that it will be his political suicide. Rouhani, who was decisively re-elected in May after promising to open Iran to the world, took the oath of office before parliament in Tehran in the presence of foreign dignitaries including senior European figures.

“The US lack of commitment to implementation of the nuclear deal … proved it to be an unreliable partner to the world and even to its longtime allies,” Rouhani said in a ceremony broadcast live on state television. The deal he championed with the United States and five other major powers in 2015 led to the lifting of most sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.

Rouhani has intensified efforts to protect the deal – the biggest achievement of his first term – against Washington’s return to an aggressive Iran policy. In comments aimed at Trump, Rouhani said: “Those who want to tear up the nuclear deal should know that they will be ripping up their own political life.”

The US Senate voted in late July to impose new sanctions on Iran over its missiles programme and human rights issues. “Iran would not be the first to pull out of the nuclear deal, but it will not remain silent about the U.S. repeated violations of the accord,” Rouhani said.

PRAISE FOR EUROPEAN PRESENCE

In a meeting with European foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini in Tehran in advance of the ceremony, Rouhani said the U.S. stance could hamper implementation of the nuclear deal. Praising the presence of senior European dignitaries at the ceremony, Rouhani said it showed Europe was determined to expand ties with Tehran.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was also quoted as saying by state media in his meeting with Mogherini: “Mr Trump is trying to destroy the nuclear accord at Iran’s expense, and Europe should be conscious of this.” Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, President of Iraq Fuad Masum, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe were also present at swearing-in ceremony.

Among the Western officials present were French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, State Secretary at the German Foreign Ministry Michael Roth, and British Minister of State Alistair Burt. Security in Tehran was increased to the highest level, the police said, two months after gunmen linked to the Islamic State group attacked parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, killing 17 people.

Rouhani’s deputy said on Wednesday that Rouhani would keep on two important ministers for his second term: Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh and Foreign Minister Zarif. The powers of the elected president are limited by those of the unelected Supreme Leader who outranks him, but the scale of Rouhani’s victory can give the pragmatist president a strong mandate.

However, analysts say Rouhani may struggle to make a significant impact given sharpening divisions in the dual clerical-republican power structure in Iran, and Trump’s aggressive policy against Tehran.

Down in jungleland: Birds outside my window,"The birds with the loudest voices, of course, are the littlest: the tailor-birds and plain-prinias and ashy-prinias. (Source: Ranjit Lal) The birds with the loudest voices, of course, are the littlest: the tailor-birds and plain-prinias and ashy-prinias. (Source: Ranjit Lal)

Most sensible birds, you would think, would abhor and shun living in Indian cities. Who needs the noise, traffic and polluting fumes, the weird emanations from cellphone towers, the fertiliser-laced food and (human) neighbours who are almost wholly unaware of your presence, let alone know your name? And yet, for the lazy birder, there can be no better place to sit and do a bit of birding than our cities. In Pune, for a few days recently, all I did was sit in the balcony of a second-floor flat in Koregaon Park (a leafy colony, with many huge banyan trees) and met a whole lot of birds, who happily continued living their own lives in full public view.

Sure, it was a bit unnerving to be awoken at 6 am every morning by the sinister whooping of the coucal or crow-pheasant: that hulking black-and-russet fellow, who lives on a diet of baby birds, lizards and suchlike delicacies, instead of a dulcet flute concert by a magpie-robin (more an evening singer here, I noticed). But he was quite a distance away and not right outside the window. The balcony, which seemed more like a machan, looked neem and sal trees in the eye, and while it was difficult to winkle out the birds from the thick foliage, the birds made as much noise as Indian holidaymakers do at hill stations (to show everyone that they have arrived and have SUVs).

It was obviously a very traumatic time for crows who had brought up koels as their own: the latter were now large enough to leave home, but still wanted to be spoon-fed by parents who were just beginning to get a wee bit suspicious. A bedraggled-looking female koel, now starting to show her true barred plumage, threw a right royal tantrum as her harassed parent wondered whether to stuff her face or not. Somewhere nearby, a white-throated kingfisher regularly let out its ringing ‘kill-lill-lill!’ territorial call, which was surprising considering it ought to have been done nesting by now. Kingfishers nest in cavities and holes drilled in sand-banks and need to have their babies out before the rains set in and turn the sand into liquid mud. As dusk fell, the spotted owlets suddenly got querulously vocal, chittering loudly to each other. Now, too, the night herons that patrolled the nallah running just beyond the boundary wall would qwarrk hoarsely at one another and flap around in their bat-like manner — snazzy in grey, blue-black and white and with staring ruby eyes. The pond heron, or paddy bird, too, would play its “now you see me, now you don’t!” game as it furled and unfurled its wings along the banks. High above, a red-wattled lapwing repeated its accusing “did-ye-do-it?” call as it circled about, keeping a watch on the entire area.

Grey hornbills would materialise and pose statuesquely on the top of a dead tree — and look like an extension of the branch they perched on. Sometimes, you needed to hear them call to convince yourself that they were actually there and that you were not just staring at dead branches. They are a shabby, dull grey and really look antediluvian — like escapees from Jurassic Park, perhaps.

The birds with the loudest voices, of course, had to be the littlest: the tailor-birds and plain-prinias and ashy-prinias that belted it out (“towit-towit-towit” from the tailorbirds, who I assume were on ‘Towitter’, too!) at electioneering volume, while remaining well hidden amongst the leaves. Occasionally, one would pop its head above the leaves, shout in your face and whirr off busily.

Much softer and sweeter were the jingling white-eyes, those solemn goggle-eyed, little yellow birds, who, I think, must outnumber sparrows now. Darting and dodging at reckless speed between the three or four tower blocks were fast-back winged house swifts in smoky brown, as deft and daring as the local two-wheeler riders.

Certainly, the most unwelcome were the blue rock doves — those city-slobs that have virtually monopolised every city: here, mercifully, kept outside the balcony by nylon netting. They would, however, thump onto the awning’s roof and proceed with their orgies-cum-fights on top of your head, so to speak. I read recently that they are supposed to be monogamous and really can’t get my head around that, considering the way they behave! Birds always toss up the odd googly!

Perhaps, the best — and most promising — sighting was that of the pair of scaly-breasted munias, which seemed to be checking out the plants in the verandah as a possible nesting site. Small birds such as sunbirds and even bulbuls often take advantage of netting. They are small enough to get through the mesh and will nest in indoor plants, safe from the predations of crows and cats, which can’t get to them or their babies. You just need to keep an eye out and be careful while watering the plants.

A walk at Joggers’ Park yielded a fantail flycatcher. Deep in the shade, it whistled us up and then bowed and prettily fanned open its tail and pirouetted daintily before vanishing into the gloom. And, at the airport departure lounge, yet another googly! Why do sparrows (which have almost forsaken big cities) love airport lounges? I’ve seen them in so many: Jaipur, Mumbai, Delhi, Dehradun, Bangalore and Pune. Here, there was a group of about four or five. They would land on the gleaming smooth floor and hilariously skid to a halt before getting busy picking up morsels.

The most disconcerting sighting, however, had to be the one from the plane’s window: a peacock running frantically alongside the taxiway. Having one of those sucked into the engine of a jet revving for take-off does not bear thinking about: I mean, for a birder to be taken out by the national bird! Infra dig, or, the most honourable birding send-off you can be accorded? Subject for a big fight!

"GST Council to discuss e-way bill, rate on textile job work","As per the rates decided by the Council, in the textiles category, silk and jute fibre have been exempted, while cotton and natural fibre and all kinds of yarns will be levied a 5 per cent GST. As per the rates decided by the Council, in the textiles category, silk and jute fibre have been exempted, while cotton and natural fibre and all kinds of yarns will be levied a 5 per cent GST.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council will hold its 20th meeting on Saturday to discuss rationalisation of rates on textiles job work, some agricultural equipment, along with norms for e-way bill. The Council, headed by finance minister Arun Jaitley, will also review the implementation of the GST regime since July 1 and may finalise a mechanism to operationalise anti-profiteering provision to protect consumers.

It is likely to lower tax rate on all job works related to textiles sector to five per cent, an official said. Currently, the GST for job works related to textile yarns, other than man-made fibres and textile fabrics is 5 per cent, while for manmade fibres, it is 18 per cent, the official said.

The roll-out of GST from July 1 has met with several protests from the textiles sector that has been demanding a cut in the tax rate on fabrics, which were brought in the tax net for the first time at the rate of 5 per cent. Jaitley had earlier this month said in Rajya Sabha that the GST rate on fabrics cannot be lowered, as it will break the chain of input tax credit.

As per the rates decided by the Council, in the textiles category, silk and jute fibre have been exempted, while cotton and natural fibre and all kinds of yarns will be levied a 5 per cent GST. Manmade fibre and yarn will, however, attract an 18 per cent tax rate. All categories of fabric attract a 5 per cent rate. Manmade apparel up to Rs 1,000 will attract a 5 per cent tax and those above Rs 1,000 will attract 12 per cent.

The Council is also likely to discuss the anomalies raised by the industry over the past one month, officials said. Officials said rules for the e-way bill are also likely to be finalised on Saturday. As per the e-way bill mechanism, inter-state and intra-state movement of goods and consignments valued at more than Rs 50,000 will be tracked under the indirect tax regime.

As per the draft provision, GSTN would generate e-way bills that will be valid for 1-20 days, depending on distance to be travelled — one day for 100 km, 3 days (100 to less than 300 km), 5 days (300-less than 500 km) and 10 days (500-less than 1,000 km). The information technology platform for the e-way bill system is being developed by the National Informatics Centre. The Council is also likely to consider representations from the agriculture sector regarding GST rate on some pesticides and agricultural equipments.

Inside Track: Unkindest cut,"The defection of Tejashreeben Patel, who signed Patel’s nomination form for the Rajya Sabha, is another blow for the Congress. (Express Photo by Anil Sharma) The defection of Tejashreeben Patel, who signed Patel’s nomination form for the Rajya Sabha, is another blow for the Congress. (Express Photo by Anil Sharma)

Unkindest cut

For master strategist Ahmed Patel, the defection of Balwantsinh Rajput and Tejashreeben Patel from the Congress’s side was the unkindest cut. Rajput owes his political career entirely to Patel, who also helped the former village grocery store owner build up a flourishing oil manufacturing business. In Rajput’s educational institutions, Ahmed Patel’s photograph is displayed prominently. For the Rajya Sabha election, Rajput was to have been one of Patel’s key aides for the campaign. But on returning to Ahmedabad after his meeting with Patel in Delhi on July 22, Rajput’s phone was switched off for nearly 72 hours. Then came the bombshell announcement that he would be contesting as the BJP’s Rajya Sabha candidate against Patel, his mentor. The defection of Tejashreeben Patel, who signed Patel’s nomination form for the Rajya Sabha, is another blow for the Congress. She was the biggest backer of Patel youth leader Hardik Patel. In fact, Hardik started his initial campaign from her house.

Quick adjustment

The two articulate JD(U) spokespersons in Delhi, K C Tyagi and Pawan Varma, did not take more than a minute to make a complete U-turn in their political arguments once Nitish Kumar announced he was switching from the Mahagathbandhan to the BJP. Varma explained the JD(U)’s “very explicable reasons — our frustration with corruption and the evidence on the ground that the people will not tolerate it’’. K C Tyagi cited Ram Manohar Lohia, Jayaprakash Narayan and Charan Singh to stress that anti-Congressism was in the DNA of the JD(U) and that by getting out in time, Nitish Kumar was saved from becoming another Manmohan Singh. However, their colleague Sharad Yadav is speechless. Last week he informed reporters that as of now he is on “maun vrat”.

Dressing down

If BJP president Amit Shah gave party Rajya Sabha MPs a dressing down for bunking during voting on a crucial clause of the National Commission for Backward Classes Bill, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was even more severe. Asked to explain their absence despite a whip, eight MPs are reported to have claimed that the doors of the Upper House were shut just as they were about to enter. While BJP ministers have taken the rebuke very seriously and have since been found sitting dutifully throughout the House deliberations, some in the BJP backbenches are still missing.

Missed opportunity

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi missed yet another opportunity to mend fences with Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh. Last week, senior Congress leaders from Delhi such as Manmohan Singh and Ghulam Nabi Azad flew down for the bhog held for Singh’s mother, Rajmata Mohinder Kaur of Patiala, who died in July last week. Even opposition leaders, such as Punjab BJP chief Vijay Sampla and Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal, were present. But Rahul chose not to attend.

Not like UP Yadavs

Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharti asserts proudly that she along with her parents and brothers and sisters are united in fighting the CBI cases against her family. “In Bihar we are not like UP,’’ she points out. This appears to be a reference to the split in Mulyam Singh Yadav’s family.

No making up

Ram Jethmalani quit as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s counsel after writing a stiff note to the CM who refused to take responsibility for his lawyer calling Finance Minister Arun Jaitley a “crook’’ in court. Jethmalani demanded payment of Rs 2 crore in fees and hinted that Kejriwal wants to settle with Jaitley. Since Jethmalani sent a copy of his letter to Jaitley, some wonder if Jethmalani wants to smoke the peace pipe. Neither of the two rumours is correct. Jaitley is determined to continue with the Rs 20-crore defamation suits, for which he has paid huge court fees in advance. If Kejriwal loses the case and pleads insolvency, under the law he would not be able to fight any future election.

Pointedly absent

Naresh Agrawal organised a reception for MP Ram Gopal Yadav, on completing 25 years in Parliament. Most of Yadav’s colleagues in the House were present at the felicitation, including bulk of the MPs from the Samajwadi Party, Venkaiah Naidu and Piyush Goyal from the BJP, Sharad Pawar and Supriya Sule from the NCP, Kamal Nath, Manmohan Singh and Ghulam Nabi Azad from the Congress. Even Prime Minister Modi attended. But Mulayam Singh Yadav did not show up and sent word at the last minute that he could not come because of ill health. Clearly the rift in the Samajwadi Party has not healed.

Petitioner who asked for Kochi Tuskers Kerala’s inclusion in IPL asked to approach Lodha committee,"Kochi Tuskers Kerala played in two season of IPL. Kochi Tuskers Kerala played in two season of IPL.

A petitioner has been asked to approach the three-member Lodha committte by Kereala High Court after he demanded the participation of former Indian Premier League franchise Kochi Tuskers Kerala in the upcoming season of IPL by filing a PIL. The committe is headed by former chief justice of India RM Lodha.

In his petition, the person alleged that BCCI removed the franchise from IPL “illegally and arbitrarily”. It also stated that BCCI is yet to pay Rs 1,200 crore which was order by the Justice Lodha.

“All these and any other grievance the petitioner has could more appropriately be dealt with by the Chief Justice RM Lodha Committee and if the said committee has any difficulty and/or reservation in examining the said issues, the same can be forwarded to the appropriate forum in BCCI itself. But surely, at the first instance this court would be reluctant to interfere in the matter,” while considering a PIL .

Kochi was prohibited from hosting IPL matches and mentioning that fact, the petitioner wrote that this is causing revenue loss to state government in the form of tax.

IPL will see its 11th season next year and it will also have Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals back in the fold after two years as they were banned for that time period.

Economist Rajiv Kumar replaces Arvind Panagariya as new NITI Aayog vice-chairman,"Economist Rajiv Kumar (Source: Twitter) Economist Rajiv Kumar (Source: Twitter)

Economist Rajiv Kumar was on Saturday appointed as the new vice-chairman of NITI Aayog, succeeding well-known economist Arvind Panagariya for the coveted post. Vinod Paul, head of the Pediatrics department at AIIMS, was also appointed as a member of the NITI Aayog.

Earlier this week, 64-year-old Panagairya had stepped down as vice-chairman of the Niti Aayog after requesting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to relieve him of his duties by August 31 to allow him to return to Columbia University as a professor of economics.

Kumar, who holds a DPhil in economics from Oxford and a PhD from Lucknow University, is a senior fellow at public policy think-tank Centre for Policy and Research (CPR) and has authored several books on the Indian economy and India’s national security.

Before coming to CPR, Kumar served as Secretary General of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). He had also held positions as Director and Chief Executive of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) and chief economist of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), as well as in positions with the Asian Development Bank, the Indian Ministry of Industries, and the Ministry of Finance.

Moreover, he is a member of boards of several international and national institutions, including the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center in Riyadh, the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and Asia in Jakarta, the State Bank of India, and the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.

"Mo Farah maintains domination with epic 10,000m win at World Championships","Mo Farah took home his 10th consecutive gold medal from World event. (Source: Reuters) Mo Farah took home his 10th consecutive gold medal from World event. (Source: Reuters)

Mo Farah launched the World Athletics Championships in scintillating fashion on Friday with another consummate 10,000 metres triumph that further embellished his claim to being the greatest distance racer in the sport’s history.

With 55,000 of his home fans roaring their support at the London Stadium, the 34-year-old Briton sprinted away with his 10th consecutive gold medal in a global track final, a dazzling sequence that ranks among the greatest feats in sport.

Farah survived being clipped twice from behind in the final lap, nearly tripping over and being forced to take a step off the track, and he ended with cuts and bruises to his “bad legs” that needed treatment.

Yet still he was able to unleash one more trademark burst down the home straight to speed away from Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei and Kenya’s Paul Tanui.

The Briton clocked 26 minutes 49.51 seconds, the world’s fastest time in 2017, in what proved perhaps the hardest-earned of all his magnificent triumphs as he protected his six-year unbeaten streak in major championships.

Silver medallist Cheptegei, just 20, clocked a lifetime best 26:49.94, chasing Farah all the way to the line, and Tanui 26:50.60.

Yet, five years to the very night when he won the 25-lap title at his home Olympics on “Super Saturday” in the same London Stadium, Farah had still not lost that invincible aura, clocking a searing 55.63 seconds for the last lap in spite of his stumbles.

It was the perfect way for him to begin his final championship as a track runner before he turns his attentions to the roads as a marathon man.

“What a way to end my career in London. It’s special,” Farah said, after hugging his children on the track.

“It was one of the toughest races of my life. With one lap to go I nearly get tripped, twice, that was hard. But I just had to be mentally stronger and think I didn’t work this hard for nothing.”

After an epic test in which the powerful Kenyan and Ugandan athletes combined with mid-race bursts to test Farah’s resolve more fiercely than ever before, the Briton had to show remarkable composure on the final lap.

Twice as he led straight after the bell while still closely pursued by four hunters, Farah was clipped. The first time, his heel was caught by Tanui and on the second bend, the same Kenyan brushed his arm, sending Farah off balance so that he took one step into the infield.

Yet despite momentarily losing his rhythm, the champion regrouped to take control on the back straight and he scorched off the final bend to forge clear and take his third successive world 10,000m title by a couple of metres.

It was the fastest he had run in any of his five global 10,000m victories by more than 11 seconds.

Still, though, he has only done half the job with the 5,000 metres to come next week and the prospect of completing a fifth straight 5,000/10,000 distance double in global championships.

Whether the battering he took will affect his hopes remains to be seen but the race certainly took a toll, as he reckoned the second incident involving Tanui with about 300 metres left had hurt him.

“I’ve got such long strides that I got caught and at that point I was just trying to stand up and think ‘I can’t go down, I can’t go down’,” he said.

The 16th edition of the Championships could not have been set up more ideally for Britain to celebrate a home triumph in the first medal event and Farah, as ever, did not disappoint his legion of fans.

After he crossed the line, he swore that the noise in the stadium matched the incredible din of his 2012 tours de force when he won the 10,000m and 5,000m here.

Down the years, his main opponents from Kenya have tried in vain to upset Farah’s equilibrium, sometimes working in teams and varying their pace and tactics but the master racer always has an answer in the sprint denouement.

A couple of blistering 61-second laps were thrown in to try to shake him but Farah’s composure never wavered as he moved up the field to join the leaders and gestured to the crowd to turn up the volume.

“I just wanted to play with the guys’ heads,” he said.

He will have the chance to play with their heads on the track one more time in the 5,000 metres, the heats of which are on Wednesday.

“I did actually hurt my leg but I’m going to see the doctor now and take care of it – a few stitches, maybe,” Farah said with a smile which suggested he is not about to have his incredible sequence ended in his final championship track race.

Rajesh Mondal steers Puneri Paltan to 26-21 win against Dabang Delhi,"Pune started the match on the front foot but Delhi eventually caught up with them. Pune started the match on the front foot but Delhi eventually caught up with them.

“Rajesh Mondal had a big hand in Patna Pirates’ win last season,” said Deepak Hooda, “Whenever Pardeep (Narwal) would not be able to make points he would chip in.” Hooda was speaking to media after his Puneri Paltan recorded their second win of the season. This time it was against Dabang Delhi. Pune won the match scoring 26 to Delhi’s 21 and eight of those came from Mondal’s raid points.

Puneri Paltan coach BC Ramesh, who was present with Hooda in the post-match press conference, said that his team remains a more well formed defensive unit and so, they need their raiders to pick up points whenever the opportunity presents itself. Mondal did just that for the Paltans. He more often than not came away with points whenever he went in to raid.

Pune started the match on the front foot but Delhi eventually caught up with them. In fact, the match can be pretty much summed up in the way those first few minutes panned out. Pune remained ahead but Delhi were never too far behind. If there was any difference, it was the fact that while the big names fired for Pune, they failed for Dabang Delhi. Meraj Shayk could not get even a single raid point throughout the match while Nilesh Shinde managed just one succesfull tackle point. Instead, it was 21-year-old Anand Patil who was amongst the points. Patil scored a total of eight raid points, six of which came from touches.

While Patil’s team mates contributed precious little, Hooda and Mondal’s efforts were backed by a strong showing from the defensive unit. Hooda himself was instrumental on that front and managed to get a tackle point to his name. Sandeep Narwal, Dharmaraj Cheralathan and Ravi Kumar all got two points each. GB More may not have got on the scoring sheet but he was vital in keeping a check on Meraj Shayk.

Dabang Delhi will have no time to ponder over this defeat as they face U Mumba on Saturday in the last match that they play at Nagpur. Puneri Paltan, on the other hand, play Jaipur Pink Panthers on Thursday.

Usain Bolt eyes Olympic final repeat to win world gold,"In the 100m, Usain Bolt’s 9.94 seconds makes him the sixth-best performer this year. (Source: AP) In the 100m, Usain Bolt’s 9.94 seconds makes him the sixth-best performer this year. (Source: AP)

Jamaica’s eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt says he thinks he will need to produce a time similar to the one that earned him gold at the Rio 2016 Games to win Saturday’s 100m final at the World Athletics Championships in London.

The 30-year-old is competing in his seventh and final World Championships, and recently clocked a season’s best time of 9.95 seconds in a Diamond League meeting in Monaco.

He told Reuters he is “not at my best but where I want to be” and has predicted he will have to set a new season’s best to win and add another gold medal to his collection at the London Stadium – where he won Olympic gold in 2012.

“I think it will have to be 9.8 low, perhaps the same time it took me to win at the (Rio) Olympics, I think it will take the same time to win here or close to that,” said Bolt, who clocked 9.81 seconds to clinch gold in Rio.

“I’m feeling good, I’m feeling better after every race. Everything is going good.” One of Bolt’s biggest rivals for gold in London was expected to be Canada’s Andre de Grasse, but a Grade 2 hamstring tear in his final training session has ruled de Grasse out of competing.

De Grasse said the prospect of missing out on what he called “the focus of my season” was “unimaginable”, but Bolt said it was vital for his future career prospects that de Grasse took a realistic approach to his injury.

“It’s always about listening to your coach and taking the doctor’s advice and taking your time to recuperate while working as hard as possible to get over the injury,” said Bolt.

“Sometimes when you rush it it only makes things worse. I hope that he takes heed, takes his time to heal and hopefully everything goes smoothly so that he can get back on track next season.”

"Once seen as possible pope, Italian cardinal Tettamanzi dies at 83","FILE – In this photo taken on March 6, 2013, Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi arrives in St. Peter’s Basilica to attend a vespers celebration at the Vatican. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia) FILE – In this photo taken on March 6, 2013, Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi arrives in St. Peter’s Basilica to attend a vespers celebration at the Vatican. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)

Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi, once seen as a possible contender to become pope, died on Saturday at the age of 83, the Milan diocese said on its website. Tettamanzi was made archbishop of the Italian port city of Genoa in 1995 and in 2002 moved to nearby Milan, one of the world’s largest dioceses with some 5 million faithful and 1,000 parishes. He had become a cardinal in 1998.

“A key figure of Milan’s social and religious history has disappeared,” Milan’s mayor Giuseppe Sala said in a note. Pope Francis wrote to Milan’s outgoing Archbishop Angelo Scola and his successor Mario Delpini to express his condolences over the departure of one of “the most loveable and beloved” prelates of the Milanese diocese. A prolific writer, Tettamanzi helped Pope John Paul draft some of his encyclicals and was seen by some Vatican watchers as a potential candidate to replace the Polish pontiff when he died in 2005.

But he was little known outside his native Italy and fellow cardinals instead elected Josef Ratzinger as pope. While archbishop of Genoa, Tettamanzi defended anti-globalisation protesters who besieged a Group of Eight summit there in 2001. “A single African child sick with AIDS counts more than the entire universe,” he said at the time.

He stood out by deciding that pilgrims visiting Genoa for the 2000 Holy Year should stop not only at the city’s great churches but also an old people’s home to get a special indulgence for the jubilee millennium year. Tettamanzi was born in Renate near Milan on March 14, 1934. He began studying as a priest at the age of 11 and was ordained at 23 by the then-archbishop of Milan, Giovanni Battista Montini, who went on to become Pope Paul VI.

"Vijender Singh expands kingdom; retains Asia Pacific, wins Oriental title","Vijender Singh beat Zulpilkar Maimaitiali by unanimous decision. (Source: PTI) Vijender Singh beat Zulpilkar Maimaitiali by unanimous decision. (Source: PTI)

Vijender Singh continued to remain unbeaten in professional boxing but he received a scare and a real hammering at the hands of China’s Zulpikar Maimaitiali in a closely contested bout at the NSCI Complex in Mumbai on Saturday. In a bout that was on par for the most part, Vijender outslugged and produce exemplary defence to not only defend his WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title but also snatched Zulpikar’s WBO Oriental Super Middleweight title. This was Vijender’s ninth successive win and seven of the wins have been KOs but this one was the furthest the Beijing Olympic bronze medallist had been pushed in his short career in the professional circuit.

Prior to the bout Vijender had claimed, in sheer confidence, that Chinese products don’t last long. But Zulpikar proved him wrong by not only extending Vijender to all ten rounds but squeezing each and every ounce out of the Indian. There were three stages in the bout where Vijender was reduced to go down to his knees after unsporting jabs by Zulpikar resulting in the referee’s intervention. But they were, after all, clean hits and took a lot out of the Bhiwani-born boxer. Into the eighth round, Zulpikar’s contact with Vijender’s face did enough to make the Indian bleed. And yet when the final verdict was announced, the decision read out 96-93, 95-94, 95-94 in favour of Vijender which clearly left many pondering as to the sensibility behind the judge’s decision.

Vijender was the better of the two boxers in the first five rounds but Zulpikar picked up in the next five to bring things at an even footing. Even though Zulpikar tried to produce good defence early on, Vijender found a way in and got some neat, clean hits into the body.

In the end though, the friendly relationship between the two was visible in the fact that Zulpikar and Vijender hugged when the bout came to a close and there was the pause before the judge’s made their decision clear. A decision in favour of Vijender to make it 9-0. One would wonder, how, but that is the problem with boxing and question marks have been raised over the officiating time and again. Only India have its first example now.

NATO soldiers suppress attempted insider attack in Afghanistan,"Romanian soldiers from the NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan killed an Afghan policeman on Saturday.

Romanian soldiers from the NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan killed an Afghan policeman who was trying to carry out an insider attack after a training session in the southern province of Kandahar on Saturday, officials said. One Romanian was wounded in the attack while an Afghan policeman was wounded in the crossfire, a statement from Resolute Support headquarters in Kabul said. “The advisers had completed a scheduled law enforcement training and were preparing to return to base when they were attacked by a member of the Afghan National Civil Order Police,” the statement said.

Romanian soldiers providing security returned fire and killed the attacker, it said.

The attack, which came as the United States is considering increasing the number of troops it has in Afghanistan, was the latest in a series of so-called “green-on-blue” incidents that have complicated the training and assistance mission.

In June, three American soldiers were killed and seven wounded in two separate incidents, a week apart. In May last year, two members of the Romanian special forces were killed and a third was wounded when a local policeman opened fire on them.

Sean Dyche in no panic to replace Michael Keane at Burnley,"Michael Keane moved to Everton last month in deal worth up to 30 million pounds. (Source: Reuters) Michael Keane moved to Everton last month in deal worth up to 30 million pounds. (Source: Reuters)

Burnley manager Sean Dyche says he is not focused on buying a replacement for England international defender Michael Keane despite having just three recognised central defenders at the Premier League club.

Keane moved to Everton last month in deal worth up to 30 million pounds ($39.41 million) after playing a major role in keeping Burnley in the top flight last season.

Asked whether he was looking to bring in a direct replacement for Keane, Dyche said: “Not necessarily. We like to ideally have two players for every position, so there is true competition.

“Ideally, in a perfect world you would have some young players underneath that, in the background. We have got three recognised centre halfs and Charlie Taylor who we brought in, I think he could adapt into a very good centre half actually.”

Taylor, who normally plays at left back, was signed from Leeds United last month and has featured in the centre of defence in pre-season games, including Tuesday’s 2-2 draw with Celta Vigo.

Dyche believes the 23-year-old Taylor could adjust to playing in a central defensive role.

“I haven’t brought him in for that reason but we played him there the other night, played him in pre-season there just because I like the look of him. I like to be open-minded, with my staff, about where players can play, not just where you buy them for,” he said.

Dyche is not however ruling out a further defensive addition before the transfer deadline closes on Aug. 31.

“If one is right for us and can fit what we are about then we would be interested but only if they can at least challenge, if not better, what we are doing at the moment,” he said.

The most likely replacement for Keane, at the moment, in the Burnley starting lineup is James Tarkowski, who has been restricted to a back-up role due to the consistent performances of Keane and Ben Mee.

While Tarkowski, 24, has had limited Premier League experience since joining the club from Championship side Brentford in February 2016, Dyche indicated he was willing to give him time.

“A few years ago we put our trust in Michael Keane, that worked out alright. So, you can’t guarantee it, you work with a player, you buy or develop the players with a view of ‘I think they can improve’ and over that improvement period still obviously do what they need to do now,” he said.

New Horizons’ next flyby target could be two icy bodies,"Even as NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft gets ready for the most distant flyby in the history of space exploration, scientists believe that the probe’s next target could actually be two objects.

(Source: NASA)

Even as NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft gets ready for the most distant flyby in the history of space exploration, scientists believe that the probe’s next target could actually be two objects. The spacecraft is scheduled to fly past the Kuiper Belt object (KBO) 2014 MU69 on January 1, 2019.

New data gathered on the object suggest it could well be two bodies that are close together or even touching. “This new finding is simply spectacular. The shape of MU69 is truly provocative, and could mean another first for New Horizons going to a binary object in the Kuiper Belt,” said Alan Stern, mission principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado.

The Kuiper Belt is a disc-shaped region of icy bodies – including dwarf planets such as Pluto – and comets beyond the orbit of Neptune. NASA said the ancient KBO, which is more than 6.5 billion kilometeres from Earth, passed in front of a star on July 17, 2017.

A handful of telescopes deployed by the New Horizons team in a remote part of Patagonia, Argentina were in the right place at the right time to catch its fleeting shadow — an event known as an occultation. They were able to capture important data to help mission flyby planners better determine the spacecraft trajectory and understand the size, shape, orbit and environment around MU69.

Based on these new occultation observations, scientists speculate that the Kuiper Belt object could be a single body with a large chunk taken out of it, or two bodies. The size of MU69 appears to be no more than 30 kilometres long, or, if a binary, each about 15-20 kilometeres in diameter, according to the scientists.

“These exciting and puzzling results have already been key for our mission planning, but also add to the mysteries surrounding this target leading into the New Horizons encounter with MU69, now less than 17 months away,” Marc Buie, the New Horizons co-investigator who led the observation campaign, said.

China in talks to sell electricity to Myanmar amid warming ties,"The work of replacement of transformers and cables was started across the state a couple of years back to strengthen the power distribution system and to lower tripping cases, but power breakdown cases have since increased. The work of replacement of transformers and cables was started across the state a couple of years back to strengthen the power distribution system and to lower tripping cases, but power breakdown cases have since increased.

Energy-hungry Myanmar is in initial talks to buy electricity from China, according to officials and documents reviewed by Reuters, in the latest sign of warming ties with Beijing under leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Since taking office in April last year, Suu Kyi has sought to repair relations that were strained when a previous semi-civilian government in 2011 blocked a China-backed dam, which was supposed to send most of its electricity to China’s Yunnan province. China’s appetite for the hydro project has waned in recent years, as a switch towards less energy-intensive industries amid an economic slowdown has left Yunnan province with a surplus of power.

Instead, Beijing has turned its attention to other projects that fit with its “Belt and Road” initiative, which aims to stimulate trade by investment in infrastructure throughout Asia and beyond.

Three Chinese state-owned companies have proposed separate plans to plug Myanmar’s national power grid into Yunnan’s electricity network, according to documents reviewed by Reuters and two people familiar with the talks.

Rural Yunnan, which generates around 85 percent of its electricity from hydropower, already sends surplus power to more developed eastern China, as well as Vietnam and Laos. While China has been supplying power on a small scale to some remote Myanmar towns near their shared border, the talks are the first to discuss connecting the national grids of the two countries to meet Myanmar’s urgent demand for electricity.

BLACKOUTS

With only a third of Myanmar’s population connected to the grid and major cities experiencing blackouts, buying electricity from Yunnan could be a short-term solution to boost its power supply, the two people familiar with the talks said.

“China welcomes the plan, but Myanmar is still reviewing the details,” said one of the people, a senior Myanmar energy official. The “government-to-government talks” were still at an early stage, the official added, with details such as price and timing still to be worked out.

“It’s one of the many options we are considering,” the official said. Htain Lwin, spokesman of Myanmar’s ministry of electricity and energy, confirmed initial talks had taken place but declined to comment further.

Myanmar has been exploring a range of plans to solve its acute energy shortage, from building coal-powered generators to tapping its reserves of deep sea gas. Some international investors and analysts have criticised a lack of clarity in the country’s energy policy.

“Myanmar needs electricity, and if China offers a compelling plan to provide more power, then it ought to be considered,” said Jeremy Mullins, research director at Yangon-based consulting firm Myanmar Energy Monitor.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

One proposal is from state-owned China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Company Ltd, which signed a memorandum of understanding with Myanmar in March last year to build a high-voltage transmission line running for several hundred miles from the border town of Muse, in northeastern Myanmar, to Meiktila in the centre of the country, the documents show.

The agreement was extended for six months in May this year and a feasibility study for the 500 kilovolt (thousand volts) transmission line is under way.

State-run China Southern Power Grid Company Ltd (CSG) proposed a similar plan in June to carry power from Yunnan via a high-voltage cable, according to the documents. A third plan, proposed by CSG’s subsidiary Yunnan International Company Ltd, would use an existing cable to carry power to Meiktila from Yunnan via Muse, according to the documents and the official familiar with the talks.

The World Bank’s Yangon-based energy specialist, Myoe Myint, said such a project could take up to five years to complete, a quicker solution in comparison with hydropower in Myanmar, where it would take far longer to build and bring online a single dam. He said rough terrain and instability along the border with China, however, could bring challenges to the power trade. Some 20,000 people in March fled Myanmar’s northeast after fighting between the government and ethnic armed groups.

CSG and its subsidiary Yunnan International declined to comment. China Electric Power Equipment and Technology did not respond to requests for comment.

STUPID IDEA

While the plan would be welcomed by many in Myanmar, where power consumption is among the lowest in the world, it could stoke concerns about China’s growing economic clout. Many officials in the Southeast Asian country have been wary of domination by its giant neighbour.

Beijing has been pushing for access to a strategically important port in Myanmar, and in April signed an agreement to pump oil through a pipeline from its western coast to landlocked Yunnan.

“What if China cut off the power trade after our grids are connected? We need to also consider the political situation and stability of the two countries,” said the first Myanmar official.

Some argue that buying electricity from China would mean an outflow of dollars from a country with little reserves of hard currency.

“Myanmar has abundant hydropower resources for power generation,” said a third senior Myanmar energy official, who is familiar with the plans but not directly involved in talks. “It’s a stupid idea to buy it from China.”

Annoyed Barcelona won’t pay Neymar bonus,"Barcelona won’t pay a 26 million euro (.8 million) bonus to Neymar for renewing his contract with the Catalan giants in 2016. (Source: Reuters) Barcelona won’t pay a 26 million euro (.8 million) bonus to Neymar for renewing his contract with the Catalan giants in 2016. (Source: Reuters)

Barcelona won’t pay a 26 million euro ($30.8 million) bonus to Neymar for renewing his contract with the Catalan giants in 2016, a club spokesman said today after his decision to join Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee.

Josep Vives admitted Barca had been left irritated by the Brazilian’s decision to leave despite signing a new five-year deal last year as PSG paid his 222 million euro ($264 million) buyout clause to leave Barca powerless to prevent Neymar moving on.

“Any separation causes annoyance, especially when it is one not wished for by the club due to a unilateral decision on the part of the player,” Vives told a press conference at the Camp Nou.

“The player hasn’t fulfilled his contract with the club…given that breach the club will not pay this renewal bonus.” Barca had deposited the bonus with a notary to be paid on September 1 had Neymar remained at the club, but have already recovered the 26 million.

During his presentation as a PSG player on Friday, Neymar said that “at no point did I lack respect to the supporters or the club” in deciding to bring to an end his four years in Catalonia.

However, Vives insisted Barca are unhappy with the way in which his exit came about. “There is annoyance at the decision, but also the way it came about.”

Yet, Vives claimed Barca can bounce back from losing out on La Liga and the Champions League last season with the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez still among a star-studded squad.

“He is a great player, we have enjoyed him a lot, but the world doesn’t end after Neymar,” he added. “It is not the first time that we have gone through a situation like this and the club has continued, grown and become more universal.”

The move is not just a huge blow for Barca’s prospects on the field, but their prestige as one of the world’s richest and most successful clubs.

It is 17 years since Barca last lost one of their prized assets against their will when Real Madrid paid Luis Figo’s buyout clause for a then world record fee.

Man-Animal Conflict: Elephant attacks in south Bengal down to 40 this year from 100 in 2015,"the state Forest and Wildlife department has been able to bring down the number of cases of man-elephant conflict in south Bengal. (File Photo) the state Forest and Wildlife department has been able to bring down the number of cases of man-elephant conflict in south Bengal. (File Photo)

After concerted efforts, the state Forest and Wildlife department has been able to bring down the number of cases of man-elephant conflict in south Bengal to 40 this year from 100 in 2015. “The entire mechanism in areas (where elephant attacks had increased) had broken down. Such as the cooperation between villagers and forest range officials. The communication between the officials in the four districts – Jhargram, Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia – where the elephant attacks had suddenly risen, was also not functioning properly. By simply putting these mechanisms of cooperation back in to place, we have been able to bring down the incidents of elephant attacks,” said Chief Wildlife warden and Principal Conservator Forests Ravi Kant Sinha.

In 2015, there were 100 reported cases of elephant attacks. In 2016, this was brought down to 70, and then this year 40 cases have been recorded so far. Till 1985, there was no elephant presence in south Bengal. Most elephants were to be found only in north Bengal in areas like Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Jalpaiguri. But as habitations grew in Jharkhand and Orissa, and human population increased in forested areas, elephants started migrating to West Bengal – specifically to south Bengal. “In 1986, the first elephant herd was recorded to have stayed in this region for 15 days after which it went back to the neighbouring states. In 1987, they stayed for 40 days and then in 1988 for three months. In 1989, south Bengal recorded its first ever elephant birth, which meant that the elephant felt comfortable enough to give birth here and the herd had adopted Bengal as its home. Now there are 100 elephants that travel to south Bengal annually in a migratory pattern,” said Sinha.

While initially there were fewer incidents of elephant attacks, over the past decade the attacks had grown as more and more land was cultivated. “Villagers, police and forest officials had started tackling elephant attacks by themselves. There was no coordination. We have now established an early warning system by which elephant movement is tracked and alerts are surrounded. We then ensure that the elephant herd is driven in a regulated manner. The elephants, therefore, venture in to villages and paddy fields less. The incidents which still take place are stray ones — where a villager has gone to an area of the forest they are not meant to go, surprised an elephant, which has attacked him. These kind of incidents we cannot prevent,” he added.

Venezuela constitutional assembly removes chief prosecutor,"Venezuela’s chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz is seen in front of the Public prosecutor’s office in Caracas, Venezuela August 5, 2017. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino Venezuela’s chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz is seen in front of the Public prosecutor’s office in Caracas, Venezuela August 5, 2017. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino

A newly installed constitutional assembly ousted Venezuela’s defiant chief prosecutor Saturday, a sign that President Nicolas Maduro’s embattled government intends to move swiftly against critics and consolidate power amid a fast-moving political crisis. Cries of “traitor” and “justice” erupted from the stately, neo-classical salon where 545 pro-government delegates voted unanimously to remove Luisa Ortega from her post as the nation’s top law enforcement official and replace her with a staunch government supporter.

They said they were acting in response to a ruling by the government-stacked Supreme Court, which banned Ortega from leaving the country and freezing her bank accounts while it weighs criminal charges against her for alleged irregularities.

Ortega, a longtime loyalist who broke with the socialist government in April, refused to recognize the decision and vowed to continue defending the rights of Venezuelans from Maduro’s “coup” against the constitution “with my last breath.”“This is just a tiny example of what’s coming for everyone that dares to oppose this totalitarian form of government,” Ortega said in the statement she signed as chief prosecutor. “If they’re doing this to the chief prosecutor, imagine the helpless state all Venezuelans live in.”

Earlier Saturday, Ortega was pushed and barred from entering her office by dozens of national guardsmen in riot gear who took control of the entrance to the building. She alleged that authorities were desperate to get their hands on dossiers containing information on dirty dealings by high-level officials, including sensitive details about millions of dollars in bribes paid by Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht.

Assembly delegates later swore in as her replacement Ombudsman Tarek William Saab, who was recently sanctioned by the Trump administration for failing to protect protesters from abuses in his role as the nation’s top human rights official.

Members of the all-powerful constitutional assembly had pledged in their first meeting to move quickly against Maduro’s opponents and didn’t disappoint. “Don’t think we’re going to wait weeks, months or years,” former Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez said Friday after she was chosen to lead the assembly. “Tomorrow we start to act. The violent fascists, those who wage economic war on the people, those who wage psychological war, justice is coming for you.”

The constitutional assembly was seated despite strong criticism from the United States, other countries and the Venezuelan opposition, which fear that it will be a tool for imposing dictatorship. Supporters say it will pacify a country rocked by violent protests. Its installation is virtually certain to intensify a political crisis that has brought four months of protests in which at least 120 people have died and hundreds more have been jailed.

Maduro also wants the assembly to strip opposition lawmakers of their constitutional immunity from prosecution, saying their constant conspiring to oust him shouldn’t be protected. While members of congress say they will only be removed by force, the opposition is struggling to regain its footing in the face of the government’s strong-arm tactics and the re-emergence of old, internal divisions.

Several opposition activists have been jailed in recent days, others are rumored to be seeking exile and one leader has broken ranks from the opposition alliance to say his party will field candidates in regional elections despite widespread distrust of the electoral system.

In a sign of its cowed, demoralized state, only a few hundred demonstrators showed up for a Friday protest against the constitutional assembly, one of the smallest turnouts in months. Those who did turn out said fear of arrest – rights groups claim there are more than 600 “political prisoners” jailed during the protests _ may be keeping people at home but urged Venezuelans to remain mobilized. “We shouldn’t think the government is winning,” said Julio Borges, president of the opposition-controlled congress, making an emotional plea for Maduro’s opponents to remain on the streets and capitalize on the government’s increasing international isolation. “The only thing it’s doing is destroying itself and committing suicide.”

President Juan Manuel Santos of neighboring Colombia called Saturday’s removal of Luisa Ortega “the first dictatorial act” of an “illegitimate” assembly and vowed solidarity with the Venezuelan people. On Saturday, the South American trade bloc Mercosur moved to suspend Venezuela for failing to follow democratic norms.

Venezuela was previously suspended in December for failing to uphold commitments it made when it joined the group in 2012. The new decision will make it harder for the country to return to good standing since the new suspension can be lifted only when the bloc is satisfied that Venezuela has restored democratic order. “Today in Venezuela there is no democracy,” Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie said. “Essentially what Mercosur is saying is: Without democracy, no, you cannot be a part of Mercosur.”

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert called the removal of Ortega an attempt to tighten the “authoritarian dictatorship” of Maduro and said her government applauded the action by Mercosur. Maduro responded by calling Mercosur’s move part of a dirty campaign led by the Trump administration to discredit Venezuela and get its hands on its vast oil reserves. “They come walking down the middle of the street barking orders, treating rulers like their maids,” Maduro told Argentina’s Radio Rebelde in an interview.

The opposition boycotted the July 30 election for the constitutional assembly, saying the rules were rigged to further entrench Maduro’s “dictatorship.” The results have come under mounting scrutiny after the international company that provided the electronic voting machines said that “without any doubt” the official turnout had been tampered with _ a charge dismissed by Maduro and the National Electoral Council.

The constitutional assembly is made up of delegates from an array of pro-government sectors such as trade unionists, students and even representatives of Venezuelans with physical disabilities. But the agenda is expected to be set by bigger-name loyalists, including Maduro’s wife, son and several Cabinet ministers who resigned to join the body. It will have sweeping powers to upend institutions and in theory could even remove Maduro, a fact held up by government supporters as a sign of its independence.

Graeme Smith questions Vernon Philander’s place in South Africa team,"Vernon Philander was ruled out of the final Test. (Source: Reuters) Vernon Philander was ruled out of the final Test. (Source: Reuters)

Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith, raising questions over fitness of Vernon Philander, has said that the fast bowler has been a struggle to keep on the field and it is frustrating to see a senior player struggling with fitness.

“This whole series, it’s been a struggle to keep Vernon on the field. It gets frustrating when you’ve got a senior player and an outstanding performer like him and fitness is becoming an issue,” Smith told ESPNcricinfo. “It raises questions about whether he is fit enough to be picked in the first place.”

Last Test, Philander had to leave the match mid-way due to an back problem. He still came out to bat and tried saving South Africa from a defeat. His team lost the third Test to trail 2-1 in the series. But, he declared himself fit for the fourth Test before being ruled out on the day of the Test. after failling a fitness Test.

“He needs to look at that, he needs to do a lot more work in his time away from the team to make sure this doesn’t keep happening,” said Smith.

Smith had captained Philander from 2011 to 2014 and during his captaincy, Philander from his debut in 2011 until Smith’s retirement in March 2014. He said that the captain needs to be stern towards the pacer.

“Sometimes you need to be a little bit harder on Vern. His skill levels are there but you need to get him into the contest sometimes,” he said.

According to the report, Smith said that he wants Philander to focus on his fitness and prolong his career as he only plays Test cricket. He also said that he should take care of his off-field activities. Philander has had a big season of niggles.

“One of the big issues for him is fitness and he does need to take a look at it. He is at that phase of his career where if he doesn’t, he could fade away pretty quickly. It makes it very difficult for Faf to build a team. You want your senior player to be respected and you can’t afford Vernon to not be finishing a series.”

South Africa are already missing former world number one bowler Dale Styen due to a shoulder injury. In the ongoing fourth Test, Chris Morris was also ruled out.

“Tactically and skills wise, we’ve been found wanting especially with the bat. There is only one player averaging in the 40s [Dean Elgar] and the rest are 35 and below. You can’t expect to come to England and compete if you can’t get big totals,” Smith said.

“The challenge for Hashim at this stage of his career is that there is a lot of pressure on him to perform in that No. 3 position with the other batters struggling to find their feet,” Smith said. “In a line-up where he had myself, Kallis, AB and everyone else, there was maybe not as much pressure on him. So this is a new challenge to him at this stage of his career.”

"Police confirm Minnesota mosque was attacked, FBI takes lead","Law enforcement officials investigate an explosion at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minn., on Saturday, Aug. 5, 2017. (David Joles/Star Tribune via AP) Law enforcement officials investigate an explosion at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minn., on Saturday, Aug. 5, 2017. (David Joles/Star Tribune via AP)

Someone apparently threw a bomb through the window of a suburban Minneapolis mosque on Saturday as people were preparing for morning prayers, damaging a room but not causing any injuries, authorities said. The FBI said investigators were looking for suspects following the blast that occurred around 5 a.m. at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, south of Minneapolis. Worshippers managed to extinguish the blaze before firefighters arrived, according to a statement from the Muslim American Society of Minnesota.

A witness reported seeing something being thrown at the imam’s office window as about a dozen people gathered for morning prayers, said Asad Zaman, the society’s director. Zaman described it as a firebombing, the Star Tribune reported. One worshipper saw a pickup truck speeding away afterward, said Mohamed Omar, the center’s executive director. He said the mosque, which primarily serves people from the area’s large Somali community, occasionally receives threatening calls and emails.

Richard Thornton, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Minneapolis Division, said during a Saturday afternoon news conference that investigators have recovered components of the device to figure how it was put together. He said authorities were also searching for the perpetrators. Trevin Miller, who lives across the street, said the explosion woke him up and felt the blast on his “insides.”

Yasir Abdalrahman, a worshipper at the mosque, said the explosion was “unimaginable.” “We came to this country for the same reason everyone else came here: freedom to worship,” Abdalrahman said. “And that freedom is under threat. Every other American should be insulted by this.” The mosque serves as a religious center and community organizing platform for Muslim activists and leaders in the area, according to the society. The group is offering a $10,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest or conviction.

A $10,000 reward also is being offered by the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR. The group said its national office is urging Islamic centers and mosques to step up security. The local chapter’s civil rights director, Amir Malik, said the group hopes the reward will help authorities quickly apprehend the perpetrator of the “act of violence.”

“If a bias motive is proven, this attack would represent another in a long list of hate incidents targeting Islamic institutions nationwide in recent months,” Malik said.

Women candidates face curses and worse in Kenyan elections,"Kenyan lawmaker Sarah Korere (R) talks to supporters during an election campaign rally in the village of Dol Dol in Laikipia County, Kenya, July 25, 2017. Picture taken July 25, 2017.

Picture taken July 25, 2017. REUTERS/Baz Ratner

Since entering politics, Kenyan lawmaker Sarah Korere has been insulted, shot at, slapped by a colleague and cursed by tribal elders – but she’s still trying to take a man’s parliamentary seat in one of Kenya’s most violent regions. Korere’s experiences are symptomatic of a wider hate campaign against female candidates in Kenyan politics, women representatives say, which helps give the east African nation the lowest representation of women in politics in its region.

The result is women lack legal protection in areas such as property rights, child support, health and education. Kenya passed a law outlawing domestic violence only in 2015. Korere helped finalise that bill, and introduced another requiring employers to provide facilities for breastfeeding staff after she showed up to parliament with a three-week-old baby and found nowhere to nurse.

“They have called me a traitor and a prostitute,” the 40-year-old said with a grin. “When elders cursed me, my mother cried for a week and begged me to leave politics.” In East Africa, nearly two-thirds of Rwandan lawmakers are women, and in neighbouring Uganda and Tanzania they make up more than a third of legislators. In Kenya, a fifth of lawmakers are women – the same proportion as Saudi Arabia.

Only 16 percent of the 10,910 candidates competing in elections next Tuesday are women, the electoral board said. None of the presidential candidates is a woman. During the last polls five years ago, Kenya tried to increase women’s representation in the 349-member lower house of parliament and 67-seat upper house.

This involved reserving 47 seats for women in the lower house, and giving them a proportion of “nominated” seats – divided up between parties according to their proportion of the overall vote. But that forces most women lawmakers into a ghetto where they control budgets that are a small fraction of those run by male lawmakers – or no money at all.

Each elected member of parliament gets 60 million Kenyan shillings ($600,000) annually for development projects in their constituency – vital for building political support. But seats reserved for women get only seven million shillings. Nominated lawmakers get no money at all. Out of Kenya’s 290 elected members of the national assembly, just 16 are women with the full lawmakers’ budget.

Elected opposition lawmaker Millie Odhiambo said most women candidates lacked the money or party support to break into mainstream politics. Male rivals often attacked them physically, she said. “They usually think women are easy targets because we are not normally violent. They think they can intimidate you and you will give up,” she said.

In April, her house was torched after she won party primaries and her bodyguard was killed during a clash with supporters of a rival.

A WOMAN IN A MAN’S WORLD

Korere, who held a seat reserved for women in the outgoing parliament, is undaunted. This time she is running for the ruling party against the sitting male opposition MP in her native Laikipia, an arid northern region plagued by violent clashes over land. “I felt I could not serve people properly as a women’s representative,” she said after holding a rally on the edge of a dusty village under a spreading candelabra tree.

A crowd of men – largely members of Korere’s Maasai tribe, dressed in colourful checked blankets – sat apart from the group of women wearing beaded necklaces, many of them nursing babies. She cracked jokes about her opponent Mathew Lempurkel, who she has accused of violently assaulting her in a cabinet office, paying tribal elders to curse her and recruiting youth to disrupt her rallies.

Her opponent, who is facing charges of inciting violence and racial contempt for unrelated incidents, did not return calls seeking comment. Messages left with his lawyer also went unanswered. Lempurkel has publicly accused Korere of assaulting him. She responds with humour. “My opponent says I cannot run because I wear a skirt,” she told the rally to laughter. “Today, as you can see, I am wearing trousers.” Her message has won support among both sexes.

“We like Sarah because she is working for people’s families. She is strong,” said Solomon Ole Pusi, who voted for her opponent in the last election but now plans to back Korere.

Opposition lawmaker Esther Passaris said the few women parliamentarians often banded together across party lines to push initiatives on issues such as preventing girls from being married too young, ensuring supplies of sanitary pads for schoolgirls to reduce absenteeism, and education standards. Last year a rival politician told Passaris “everyone wants to rape you” on live television. The talk-show host, also a man, just laughed. Attitudes like that are why women need more power in Kenya, she said.

“Women are half of the population and men do not represent their needs,” she said. “In a patriarchal society, there’s a lot of rape and violence against women and children … Men haven’t really focused on it but the women want it to stop.”

Vote nears on corruption trial for Brazil President Michel Temer,"Brazilian President Michel Termer (Source: wikimedia) Brazilian President Michel Termer (Source: wikimedia)

Brazilian lawmakers angrily debated ahead of an unprecedented vote on whether President Michel Temer should face trial for alleged corruption, just a year after his predecessor was booted from office. Opposition deputies brandished placards today mocking Temer’s rockbottom approval ratings and wheeled in a suitcase similar to one used by a Temer aide when he was caught carrying the equivalent of USD 150,000 cash in alleged bribe money. “Out with Temer,” they shouted.

Temer, a deeply unpopular veteran of the ruling center-right PMDB party, is accused of taking bribes from a meatpacking industry executive — part of a wider scandal sucking in major politicians of every stripe.

If two-thirds of deputies in the lower house of Congress authorize a trial and the Supreme Court accepts the case, Temer would be suspended and lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia would take over.

The upheaval comes only 12 months after Congress ejected Temer’s leftist predecessor Dilma Rousseff in an impeachment trial for breaking budget rules.

Temer is the first sitting president to face criminal charges and now the left, which opposes his business-friendly economic reforms, smells a chance for revenge.

“A thief is a thief and needs to be treated as a thief,” Major Olimpio, a deputy with the leftist Solidariedade party, told the assembly.

But analysts believe Temer has enough support to stop a two-thirds majority, in which case the charge would be thrown out.

The president’s lawyer, Antonio Claudio Mariz de Oliveira, called the case “fiction.”

Temer himself was bullish, telling lawmakers at a dinner held Tuesday to try to win their support that he is “the victim of banditry and that he needs to fight back,” Globo newspaper reported.

There had been an opposition bid to prevent today’s vote from going ahead in order to leave Temer hanging and even more vulnerable to new charges.

However, lawmakers unexpectedly reached the required quorum of two-thirds of the 513 deputies quite quickly.

Each deputy was to vote individually and in public on live national television, making a short statement. The process, once started, will take hours to complete.

Temer is the highest-profile target in Brazil’s Operation Car Wash anti-graft probe, which has uncovered rampant bribery and embezzlement in big business and high politics. Expectations are that top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot could file a second criminal charge — for obstruction of justice — in the coming weeks.

In the current charge, Temer is alleged to have been the intended recipient of the cash being carried by a close aide in Sao Paulo. The money was allegedly an installment in millions of dollars of bribes that the JBS meatpacking giant agreed to pay Temer.

In a separate investigation, prosecutors cite a secretly recorded late-night meeting between Temer and one of JBS’s owners, Joesley Batista. In the recording, Temer allegedly is heard authorizing hush money payments to a onetime senior politician convicted of corruption, Eduardo Cunha.

Batista gave prosecutors the recording as part of his cooperation in a plea deal, one of the many that Car Wash investigators have used to build graft cases.

But Temer has proved a canny operator in Brazil’s toxic political landscape.

Rousseff claimed to have been the victim of a coup mounted by the right, including Temer, who was her vice president. Once impeachment proceedings began, she was swiftly pushed out.

Temer, however, has shored up his own teetering coalition with political patronage and support from business interests that back market reforms aimed at strengthening signs of a tepid economic recovery.

“Five major parties have already decided to back the president and that alone comes to 200 votes,” said an aide.

Temer then would need only the support — or abstentions — of 172 deputies to bury the charge against him.

"Arjun Atwal slips after good start, lies 48th in United States","Arjun Atwal’s two double bogeys on the back nine meant he fell sharply to be placed Tied 48th. (Source: AP) Arjun Atwal’s two double bogeys on the back nine meant he fell sharply to be placed Tied 48th. (Source: AP)

Arjun Atwal shot no less than six birdies but his two double bogeys on the back nine meant he fell sharply to be placed Tied 48th after the first round of the Barracuda Championships, which is played in the same week as WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.

Starting from the 10th tee, Atwal was cruising well with four birdies in his first nine and for a brief period was even in lead. Then he dropped a double on third before getting a birdie on fourth and again dropping a second double on sixth. He ended the day with a birdie on ninth for a total of six points.

John Huh needed just 24 putts at Montreux Golf and Country Club, the last from six feet for his eighth birdie to close with 15 points and a held one-point lead over Stuart Appleby and Miguel Angel Carballo.

Appleby also had eight birdies against two bogeys, while Carballo made up ground with a pair of eagles, one in which he holed out from 160 yards on No. 17. This is the only PGA TOUR event that uses the modified Stableford format that awards five points for an eagle and

three points for a birdie, while deducting one point for a bogey and three points for a double bogey or worse.

Huh is not in the PGA Championship next week, meaning he has only the Barracuda Championship and the Wyndham Championship in two weeks to finish inside the top 125 in the FedExCup and keep his TOUR card for next season. Huh currently is at No. 112.

Six players were at 13 points, a group that included Ryan Palmer. He needs to win to get into the PGA Championship next week at Quail Hollow. The PGA is holding a spot for a player who wins at Montreux that is not already eligible.

"BJP, RSS carried out the attack, it’s Modi’s style of politics: Rahul Gandhi","Banaskantha Superintendent of Police Neeraj Badgujar confirmed to The Indian Express that a stone was thrown at the car in which Rahul was on his way to the helipad after meeting flood victims at Dhanera. Banaskantha Superintendent of Police Neeraj Badgujar confirmed to The Indian Express that a stone was thrown at the car in which Rahul was on his way to the helipad after meeting flood victims at Dhanera.

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday accused the BJP and RSS workers of carrying out the attack on his vehicle in Banaskantha and said that this was Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP’s way of politics. The Congress also hit out at the BJP for not condemning the incident. “BJP workers hurled a big stone at me. It hit my PSO. This is Modiji, BJP’s and RSS’s style of politics. What can we say,” Rahul told reporters here. “When they themselves do such a thing, how will they condemn it. It is done by their people, so how can they condemn it.”

Senior Congress leader and former Finance Minister P Chidambaram also questioned the BJP leadership for not condemning the incident. “Why has the BJP’s national leadership not condemned the attack,” he said, adding: “Abuse, false charges, suppression of protests and now violence. Nevertheless, BJP will not succeed in making Congress-mukt Bharat.”

Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad termed the attack a “pre-planned conspiracy”. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that instead of taking action against the culprits, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani resorted to attacking Rahul Gandhi and the Congress on Twitter. “Is it not a tacit approval for this heinous attack,” Surjewala said.

Title: When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan’s Poetics

Author: Guillermo Rodriguez

Publisher: Oxford University Press

Pages: 576

Price: Rs 1195

I am always wary of being told how to read a poet. When it is a poet whose work I care for, my resistance increases. And so, it was somewhat guardedly that I picked up this book on AK Ramanujan, a writer towards whom I feel not mere admiration, but gratitude and a very real kinship.

Every writer creates his own precursors, wrote the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges. For me, AKR is a precursor for several reasons. I have long enjoyed the philosophical restlessness, the quiet self-deprecating irony, the unobtrusive rigour of his poetry. I recently revisited his translations of Nammalvar and was struck all over again by his alchemic ability to transform a 1,000-year-old poet into our contemporary — urgent, fearless, hoarse with longing and naked greed. AKR, at such times, becomes a precursor because, as translator, he uncovers for us an entire literary genealogy to which we can now claim allegiance.

More recently, on re-reading poems like ‘Fear No Fall’, that moving evocation of the Tamil saint poet Arunagiri, I have felt a growing curiosity about the intersections between AKR as poet-intellectual and as a translator of ecstatic mystical verse. These later poems seem to offer glimpses of the poet as pilgrim, one who values literary poise and precision, but yearns also for the inspired self-forgetfulness of ‘possession’.

What makes Rodriguez’s volume rewarding is the fact that he shares the wonder of discovering AKR. Drawing on scholarly essays as well as AKR’s own private journals and unpublished work, it adopts an approach that is ‘both context sensitive and reflexive’, formal and biographical, academic and introspective, allowing each category to interrogate and nourish the other. And, underlying this whole exercise, is a passionate curiosity about AKR. Through this multifocal lens, we are offered fascinating access to the mind of the poet — chronically incapable of rigidity or narrowness, hungry for places where beauty meets truth, often fractured by self-doubt, reluctant to rest content with easy victories, and always deeply, instinctively exploratory.

There is nothing schematic or critically legislative about this volume. It constantly invites the reader to look beyond pat binaries: east-west, akam-puram, interior-exterior, emotional-intellectual, insider-outsider, private-public, mother tongue-father tongue, little tradition-big tradition. Nuancing each category, it cautions us from reading AKR’s journey as that of the homesick exile, rediscovering his Indian roots in a foreign land. Instead, it reminds us of the complexity and variety of his inheritance in India, his ability to draw upon his Tamil and Kannada literary background without resorting to a chauvinist discourse, and his stout refusal to see either the Western or the Indian as monolithic categories.

‘Between’ becomes the operative word here. It signifies an awareness of the hyphen as a tremendous possibility that allows for a condition of multiple citizenship. Indeed, Ramanujan wryly described himself as “the hyphen in Indo-American studies”.

The book is liberally peppered with interesting quotes. In one, Ramanujan calls himself “a multiple monolingual”. In another: “It looks as if I live between things all the time — two (or more) languages, two countries, two disciplines.” Or, yet again: “The whole question of roots is not relevant to me… India is me and with me…” And again, ‘It takes some time before you realise that there are limits your culture has placed on you. Only they are not just limits. They are also resources.’

AKR’s image of his childhood home as a multi-tiered cultural abode (he imbibed Tamil from his mother, Sanskrit and English from his father) is significant in its refusal to posit an immutable divide between inside and outside, mother and father tongue: “[There was] a downstairs for the Tamil world, an upstairs for the English and the Sanskrit, and a terrace on top that was open to the sky… Each had a literature that was unlike the others…and it became the business of a lifetime for some of us to keep the dialogues and quarrels alive and to make something of them.”

There is no cultural machismo here — no impulse to celebrate akam over puram, foundation over terrace. Indeed, how can there be when the terrace is always open to the wilderness of sky — always challenging any snug, self-serving, static identity, aware of the tensions and ambiguities within each tradition, forever inviting us to discovery?

The ideal book on AKR, says Rodriguez, would ‘have to be written by a multidisciplinary team comprising a cultural anthropologist, a literary critic and theorist, a specialist in modern Indian poetry in English and Kannada, a Sanskritist, a Dravidian literature expert, a folklorist, a linguist, a translator and a poet’. Or, he adds, all of the above! One sees his point. It is a tall order. And yet, I suspect a vital key to understanding Ramanujan lies in seeing him foremost as a poet. It is the poet’s capacity to revel in metaphor and slippage, to distrust the rigidly ideological and doctrinaire, to doubt deeply and yet stay open to mystery, that, I imagine, made Ramanujan the inspired translator and scholar he was.

This, then, is the enduring contribution of this volume: the insight that it offers into inner workings of the mind of a remarkable writer-scholar, his capacity to remain poised between identities, to see their ruptures and continuities, without giving in to the extremes of foaming parochialism or glib internationalism. We rediscover Ramanujan as our culturally sophisticated contemporary — more fascinating and more urgently relevant to our lives than ever before. Arundhathi Subramaniam is an award-winning poet and author.

"Northwestern professor, Oxford staffer jailed in stabbing","FILE – This undated file photo released by the Chicago Police Department shows Wyndham Lathem, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University. (Chicago Police Department via AP) FILE – This undated file photo released by the Chicago Police Department shows Wyndham Lathem, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University. (Chicago Police Department via AP)

Far from their prestigious campuses, a Northwestern University professor and a University of Oxford finance officer were jailed in the San Francisco area Saturday after eight days as fugitives sought in the death of a young hairdresser in Chicago stabbed repeatedly until the knife broke, police said. The Northwestern microbiologist, Wyndham Lathem, had a personal relationship with the victim, although the nature of it wasn’t clear, and Lathem had made a video apologizing for what he called “the worst mistake of my life,” police said.

Lathem, 42, was being held without bail in Alameda County and faced a court appearance in the city of Pleasanton. The other suspect, Andrew Warren, a treasury assistant at one of Oxford’s residential colleges in England, was being held at the county jail in San Francisco. Both men surrendered separately and peacefully in the Bay Area on Friday evening.

They had been fugitives since the body of 26-year-old Trenton James Cornell-Duranleau was found in Lathem’s Chicago apartment on July 27. Police said Lathem had a relationship with Cornell-Duranleau, who moved to Chicago from the Grand Rapids, Michigan, area after receiving his cosmetology license. They have not elaborated on how Cornell-Duranleau or Lathem knew Warren, or if Warren knew them before he arrived in the United States.

Chicago police said Warren was 56; he was booked into jail as age 49. A deputy U.S. marshal said Lathem’s surrender came after fast-paced negotiations through an attorney that led to the fugitive turning himself in at the federal courthouse in Oakland. Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Frank Conroy told The Associated Press that the telephone negotiations began late Friday afternoon and by evening, Lathem arrived by car at the courthouse.

No guns were drawn, but Lathem was ordered to carefully step out of the vehicle and was taken into custody in a courtyard area, Conroy said. According to Conroy, Lathem stated that he would not answer questions on the advice of a lawyer, and no questions were asked. Investigators talked with Lathem’s friends during the week, including people from his graduate and undergraduate days, along with his colleagues.

“They knew the seriousness of the charges, the seriousness of the case and how important it was that he be brought into custody, not have to live a life on the run,” Conroy said. “He knew that.” Conroy said he believed some of the friends were in contact with Lathem while he was a fugitive, and that the attorney probably became involved through a recommendation.

Conroy didn’t have any details on Warren’s surrender because “he wasn’t our primary target, Mr. Lathem was.” Police said Lathem had sent a video to friends and relatives apologizing for his involvement in the crime, which he called the “biggest mistake of my life.” The video raised concern among investigators that Lathem might kill himself. “We are also thankful both men are safely in custody and this did not end in further tragedy,” a police statement said.

Warren arrived in the United States three days before Cornell-Duranleau’s death. He and Lathem were seen in surveillance video leaving Lathem’s high-rise apartment building the day of the stabbing. In a bizarre twist, police said that on that same day, before the body had been discovered, Lathem and Warren drove about 80 miles (128 kilometers) northwest to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where one of them made a $1,000 cash donation to the public library there in Cornell-Duranleau’s name. Lake Geneva police said the man making the donation did not give his name.

“I’ve never seen where suspects in a homicide would make a donation in the victim’s name,” said Lake Geneva police Lt. Edward Gritzner. On the night of the slaying, police said the front desk of the building where Lathem lived in Chicago’s trendy River North neighborhood received an anonymous call from a person who said that a crime had been committed in Lathem’s 10th floor apartment. When police opened the door they found Cornell-Duranleau’s body.

Police also said that by the time they found the body on the night of July 27, Cornell-Duranleau had been dead for 12-15 hours Cornell-Duranleau’s mother, Charlotte Cornell, didn’t immediately reply to an email requesting comment on the arrests.

Sure you have fought with them all year round, and cribbed hard when they stood up on you, but make peace this Friendship Day and gift a book. Book lovers will tell you nothing gives them greater joy than a new book.

Call it a boring choice all you want, but in this day and age when we carry our phone chargers with more diligence than a water bottle, power banks are a saviour. Also, remember the number of times the line went dead just when you were coming to the interesting bit of your story because your friend’s phone ran out of charge? Remember how that hurt? It’s time to change that.

We all have that one friend who really, really wants a pet. And though gifting a pup or a kitten is a great idea, it is also a lot of work that said friend may not be equipped to handle. So start with something simpler and stationary, maybe? Gift a plant and let them get into the habit of watering it everyday. If you see they are doing fine, get them the pup they have been eyeing for next year.

Let us begin by saying a par of speakers is an investment. Sure, you and your friends like similar kind of music (and if you all don’t, haven’t you forced the other to sit through each other’s favourite song?) and for all the future fun parties you both have planned in your heads, having a good pair of speakers is a must for that.

Russia’s ex-ambassador to US Sergei Kislyak rejects accusations of meddling,"U.S. President Donald Trump with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, left, next to Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kislyak at the White House in Washington.

The former Russian ambassador to the United States has strongly denied the accusations of meddling in the U.S. presidential election.

Sergei Kislyak, who has just returned from Washington, said Saturday on Russian state TV that he was merely doing his job as a diplomat when he met with members of President Donald Trump’s team. He said he also had met with representatives of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, but didn’t give any names.

Kislyak described the U.S. accusations against him as absurd and “shameful” for the U.S., adding that the official acknowledgement that his phone conversations were bugged was “unhealthy.”

Kislyak’s contacts with members of Trump’s team have been part of congressional and FBI investigations into possible collusion between Trump campaign and Russia. Russia has denied any interference in the U.S. election.

Surround space: Parul Sharma’s debut solo presents her worldview through black and white photographs,"One of Parul Sharma’s photographs One of Parul Sharma’s photographs

Introducing the works that comprise her debut solo, photographer Parul Sharma notes that the collection is intended at re-examining the “asymmetry of everydayness”. Clicked from her iPhone, the black-and-white photographs chronicle Sharma’s sojourns in the last couple of years — Mumbai, London, Paris, Kyoto, Tokyo and Delhi — but she prefers to keep the locations discreet. “I don’t like to put anything in a box. I don’t want to hinder the perspective of a person who is trying to establish a connect with my framework based on their ideas and experiences. They should be able to interpret it the way they want, and that is art,” says the former communications professional.

The high ceilings at the imposing Bikaner House in Delhi seem befitting for the display. The 40 frames offer distant and more detailed observations, featuring spiral stairs, abstract compositions and architectural details. If in one frame an empty chair waits for its occupant, in another, the window grill forms patterns on inclined beds. Diagonal lines cut across a frame in a work, while in another, Sharma photographs a street from the hollow of a metal structure.

She shoots the arch of the well-recognised Ministry of Home Affairs building in Delhi, and offers an aerial view of a busy road in Tokyo. Concentric metal nails that fill a white backdrop appear like the cosmic dot or bindu that has inspired numerous Indian artists. It has also attracted the attention of the buyers, with three red dots pasted next to it a day after the exhibition opened.

There are other occasions when Sharma gives viewers a closer glimpse into her surroundings. She places an empty Hibiki whiskey bottle on a pile of magazines on a windowsill at her Delhi home, and plays with light at a Hauz Khas haunt. The black and white medium, she believes, helps her connect deeper with the viewers. “It has a starkness, rawness, and life is largely black, white and grey,” says Sharma.

ECB denies contact from South Africa over appointment of Ottis Gibson as head coach,"Ottis Gibson was coach of West Indies before rejoining England. (Source: Reuters) Ottis Gibson was coach of West Indies before rejoining England. (Source: Reuters)

South Africa are reported to have targeted England bowling coach Ottis Gibson as their next head coach but the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said they have had no contact over the matter.

Barbadian Gibson was coach of West Indies before rejoining England and taking up his previous role as the bowling specialist.

Media reports say that South Africa do not intend to retain their current coach Russell Domingo after the conclusion of the series with England.

“We have had no approach from Cricket South Africa. We will not listen to any approaches until after the current series has concluded,” the ECB said in a statement. Domingo’s contract runs out at the end of this season and the position was advertised by Cricket South Africa (CSA) with Domingo reapplying for the role.

CSA has said that a final decision will be announced after the England series, which ends on Aug. 8.

‘Lucifer’ heat wave keeps parts of Europe in red alert,"A two-month-old baby hippopotamus stays close to its mother as they cool down on a hot summer day at Belgrade City Zoo, Serbia, August 4, 2017.

No wonder it’s been dubbed “Lucifer.” A relentless heat wave that gripped parts of Europe this week has sent temperatures soaring to record highs for several days, causing at least two deaths and prompting authorities to issue weather alerts. Extreme heat in Italy, and parts of France and Spain and the Balkans, has led to dozens of wildfires, damaged crops and fuelled power and water consumption.

Authorities in some areas issued traffic restrictions and banned work in the open in the hottest part of the day as temperatures reached more than 40 C.

Spain’s national weather service today issued an emergency warning for high temperatures for 31 of the country’s 50 provinces as forecasts predicted temperatures of up to 44 C.

Although this part of Europe is used to scorching summers, meteorologists have warned that such high temperatures lasting over several days aren’t that common. Serbian authorities have said the hot spell came from Africa.

“It is just too much,” said 52-year-old real estate agent Sasa Jovanovic, from Belgrade, the Serbian capital. “Sometimes it feels as if I cannot breathe.”

In the Alpine nation of Slovenia, authorities reported earlier this week the first-ever “tropical night” at 1,500 meters (4,920 feet) in the mountains, meaning temperatures were higher than 20 C (68 F) during the night.

Authorities in other countries urged people to stay indoors and drink a lot of water. The public health institute in Belgrade issued heat instructions, telling people to keep wet towels on windows if there is no air conditioning, and avoid physical strain and alcohol.

In Croatia, authorities have appealed to the thousands of tourists vacationing along the country’s Adriatic coast to be careful on the beaches and while travelling.

The streets of Montenegro’s capital, Podgorica, and other towns, were empty on the weekend, sending people flocking to the country’s Adriatic coast. Authorities there issued a fire alert because of dry weather.

Some 15 wildfires have been reported in Albania, and dozens of others throughout the region. Hot and dry weather has scorched crops amid fears of water shortages in Italy and Serbia as authorities appealed for care in consumption.

In Romania, police banned heavy traffic on major roads in daylight hours during the weekend because of the heat wave, while trains slowed down. A train service in southern Serbia also was delayed earlier this week after tracks buckled in the heat.

Romania reported two heat-related deaths â€” a 45-year-old man collapsed and died Friday while working in a field in the northeast, while a 60-year-old man died of a heart attack in the street in an eastern port Thursday.

In neighbouring Hungary, the state railway company said it would distribute water at busy terminals. At the Budapest Zoo, Beliy and Seriy, a pair of 2-year-old polar bear cubs, were given huge chunks of ice and freezing-cold watermelons to help them withstand the weather conditions.

National Green Tribunal allows registration of diesel ambulances for carrying patients,"The National Green Tribunal. (Express Photo) The National Green Tribunal. (Express Photo)

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has allowed registration of four diesel ambulances of the premier medical institute AIIMS, which conform to BS-IV emission norms, for transportation of patients.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar granted the relief to the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) after it assured it that it would dismantle the vehicles which were more than 10 years old. The green panel, however, made it clear that these ambulances will be used only for carrying patients and not for any other purpose.

The application of the AIIMS would be allowed subject to the scrapping of 10-year old ambulances and condemned, it said. “It is stated by the officer that these ambulances are BS-IV compliant. Proof thereof should be furnished before the registering authority and upon furnishing these conditions, these vehicles may be registered and permitted to ply in accordance with law,” the bench said.

AIIMS had approached the green panel seeking registration of its new vehicles as the tribunal had last year banned registration of new diesel vehicles as well as their re-registration after 10 years. Later, the Supreme Court had also banned registration of diesel-run SUVs and cars having engine capacity beyond 2000cc in Delhi and National Capital Region. Due to this, the transport department was not registering the newly-procured vehicles, which conform to BS-IV norms and not re-registering the old ones, the Board said.

In a jolt to diesel car owners in the national capital, the tribunal had directed the Delhi government to cancel the registration of all diesel-powered vehicles over 10 years old from plying in the city. Later, the tribunal had clarified that de-registration of old diesel vehicles in the national capital would be carried out in a phased manner.

Worker dies after inhaling toxic gas from sewer in Kanpur city,"One person died and two others fell ill while cleaning a sewer in Barra area of Kanpur city. (Source: Google Map) One person died and two others fell ill while cleaning a sewer in Barra area of Kanpur city. (Source: Google Map)

One person died and two others fell ill while cleaning a sewer in Barra area of Kanpur city on Saturday afternoon. According to officials, they were not wearing any safety gear for the job. Barra station officer Bhaskar Mishra said Guddu, Babulal and Prakash, all local residents, were rushed to a hospital soon after they fell ill. Prakash, 45, was declared brought dead, he said. Municipal Commissioner Avinash Singh said the three men were outsourced from a private firm and were tasked with cleaning only drains, and not sewers, which is handled by Jal Sansthan, another body under the Urban Development Department.

Singh said a preliminary inquiry revealed that the three had completed the Corporation’s work by 2 pm but were called by another person to clean a septic tank in a colony. He said the workers entered it without wearing any safety gear like face mask. They may have fallen ill after inhaling toxic gas from the sewage, he said. “Municipal officials were not involved in this work. An additional municipal commissioner will conduct an inquiry into the whole incident,” he added.

Station Officer Mishra said family members of the deceased have not complained yet. He said more details about the incident will be gathered from the officials of Municipal Corporation and the private firm for which they worked.

Sunil Singh, an official of JTN Services, the firm that outsourced the men to the Corporation, said they was still gathering information about the incident.

Catch Usain Bolt in his final 100m at Worlds Championships? Christian Coleman thinks he can,"Christian Coleman won the 100 and 200 at the NCAA championships in June. (Source: Reuters) Christian Coleman won the 100 and 200 at the NCAA championships in June. (Source: Reuters)

Christian Coleman’s career record against Usain Bolt: 0-0. The University of Tennessee product who recently turned pro could actually end up in very rare company – a sprinter with a winning mark against the Jamaican great. That would involve Coleman pulling off the improbable – impossible? – in Bolt’s final 100-meter race at the world championships. The semifinals and final are Saturday.

Coleman is one of the few who could challenge Bolt, especially with Andre De Grasse of Canada withdrawing because of a hamstring injury. Coleman finished in 10.01 seconds Friday, the second-fastest time behind another Jamaican, Julian Forte (9.99). And while Bolt won his heat, his time of 10.07 was eighth overall. Don’t read too much into that, though. Bolt always saves his best for big occasions.

“I have a lot of confidence in myself that I can come out and win,” Coleman said. “But you never take anybody for granted. … Got to make sure I’m on my `A’ game, make sure I’m ready to compete.”

The 21-year-old Coleman certainly is getting his name out there. He won the 100 and 200 at the NCAA championships in June. But before that, he made a splash by sprinting 40 yards in 4.12 seconds , then posting video of it after the NFL draft. His time was faster than any football player who ran at the NFL combine.

Fun, though that was a mere sideshow. Sprinting is his game, and Coleman has grown up a big fan of Bolt’s. He insisted he’s not the least bit intimidated by Bolt, whose presence and 6-foot-5 frame cast a large shadow.

“You can’t call yourself the best if you don’t go against the best,” Coleman said. “I’ll be ready to compete. I won’t be distracted.”

Coleman doesn’t rattle easily, something his coach in college learned early on.

“We call him `Cool-man,’ instead of Coleman,” said Tim Hall, an assistant at Tennessee. “Because his temperament is always even in terms of focusing on the things he wants to accomplish. He’s been able to apply those things to his daily practice sessions. You see the results when he’s on the track.”

A few sprinters who could give Bolt a run for his gold Saturday:

THE TOP CONTENDER: The 35-year-old Justin Gatlin made a tactical mistake at the 2015 world championships in Beijing, going into his lean too early as Bolt sneaked past him by 0.01 seconds. Gatlin also finished runner-up to Bolt at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. “I feel good. I feel confident,” Gatlin said of his chances this time. “We’ve been working on some things, making sure our race pattern is a little different than before.”

THE OTHER JAMAICAN: Yohan Blake’s request is simple: Don’t call him “The Beast” anymore. Blake has the distinction of being the last sprinter to win a 100-meter gold at the worlds other than Bolt. Blake captured the title at the 2011 world championships after a false start by Bolt led to a disqualification. Blake has been slowed by injuries in recent seasons and finished second in his heat Friday behind Abdul Hakim Sani Brown of Japan.

THE OTHER, OTHER JAMAICAN: Forte tied his personal best in posting the evening’s top time. A confidence boost? “I’ve always been confident,” Forte said. “I just kept it at its high level.”

THE LONG SHOT, PART I: Ever heard of Chijindu Ujah? The British sprinter may not win, but could be in the mix for a medal. He won the 100 a month ago in a Diamond League race in London.

THE LONG SHOT, PART II: Akani Simbine of South Africa did just enough to advance Friday. He did beat the likes of Gatlin and De Grasse during a Diamond League meet in Doha in May.

Foxconn steers clear of Donald Trump’s $30 billion investment claim,"Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou (L) shakes hands with U.S. President Donald Trump during a White House event. (Reuters Photo, File) Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou (L) shakes hands with U.S. President Donald Trump during a White House event. (Reuters Photo, File)

Foxconn Technology Group is not saying whether it plans to invest $30 billion in the United States, as President Donald Trump claimed the company’s leader told him “off the record.” Trump announced to a group of small-business leaders at the White House on Tuesday that Foxconn CEO Terry Gou told him privately that the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer could invest as much as $30 billion in the U.S. The company signed a deal with Wisconsin last week to build a $10 billion display panel manufacturing plant and Trump did not specify where the additional spending would be.

Foxconn reiterated in a statement Wednesday that the Wisconsin plant “will be the first of a series of facilities we will be building in several states.” It did not address Trump’s statement about the total investment amount or Trump’s claims that Gou told it to him in confidence.

“We have not yet announced our investment plans for other sites,” Foxconn said in the statement. “We will provide an update as soon as we have finalized those plans.”

The company may be looking at a separate Wisconsin site in Dane County, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Wednesday , citing multiple sources it did not identify. The paper said no offers have been exchanged and there were no guarantees any would be, but there could be developments in the next two months.

It wasn’t clear what kind of facility the second site would be.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said in an interview with WITI-TV that the company would expand in Wisconsin, to “tap into our intellectual talent in Madison and Milwaukee.”

“What we are getting from Foxconn is that they are committing to Wisconsin,” Ryan said. “We do anticipate that there’s going to be more than just this one location in the Racine-Kenosha area.”

Gou previously said that Foxconn was considering locating in seven states before Trump announced last week that a massive liquid crystal display monitors plant would be going to Wisconsin. Other states that Foxconn said it was looking at were Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.

Foxconn is the world’s largest contract maker of electronics, with factories across mainland China. It’s best known for making iPhones and other Apple devices but its long list of customers includes Sony Corp., Dell Inc. and BlackBerry Ltd.

The new plant in Wisconsin, which is scheduled to open in 2020 with 3,000 employees, will construct liquid crystal display monitors used in televisions and computers. It would bring Foxconn closer to its biggest market and be the first LCD monitor factory located outside of Asia.

The Wisconsin Legislature is considering a $3 billion incentive package that must be passed by the end of September as part of the deal with Foxconn. A public hearing on the proposal was scheduled for Thursday, just six days after a draft of the plan was released and eight days after news of the state’s deal with Foxconn broke.

Republicans who control the Legislature are split on how quickly to pass the bill, with state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald saying there are too many unanswered questions about the tax breaks that must be addressed before a vote. Some Democrats and others have questioned whether the incentives are too much, while also raising concerns about the proposed waiving of state environmental permit requirements and other regulations to speed up construction.

U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democratic congressman who represents a swath of south-central Wisconsin that includes Madison, questioned during a news conference Wednesday how many jobs will actually materialize and how much those workers will really be paid. He added that he’s worried Foxconn might abandon its plans if Trump fails to follow through on his proposal to raise import tariffs.

“We’ve got to be very real about what this actually means for Wisconsin taxpayers,” Pocan said.

Ryan, speaking at an employee town hall in his southeastern Wisconsin congressional district, called the deal a “game-changer” that “is a generation’s worth of economic development.” Ryan said he pitched federal job training benefits and tax credits that make the U.S. competitive to Foxconn officials who were deciding whether to locate here.

Ryan said he believed Wisconsin’s central location, and an abundance of colleges, universities and technical colleges where future workers could receive the necessary training helped the state win the project. Foxconn is eyeing property in Ryan’s district.

“It’s a really good deal for Wisconsin,” he said.

Russia’s Kislyak: Talks with Donald Trump’s ex-security aide “absolutely transparent”,"Michael Flynn was forced to resign in February after it became known that he had failed to disclose the content of conversations he had with Kislyak and misled U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence about their meetings.

(AP Photo/ File)

Russia’s former ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak, said on Saturday his conversations with former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn had been transparent and focussed on matters of U.S.-Russia cooperation. Kislyak ended his tenure in Washington in July but remains a key figure in ongoing U.S. investigations into Moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Flynn was forced to resign in February after it became known that he had failed to disclose the content of conversations he had with Kislyak and misled U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence about their meetings. “We only spoke about the most simple things … but the communication was completely correct, calm, absolutely transparent. In any case, there were no secrets on our side,” Kislyak said during a panel discussion on Russian television.

“There are a number of issues which are important for cooperation between Russia and the United States – most of all, terrorism. And that was one of the things we discussed.”

A day in the life of a tank: The last stand,"The M-47 tank was captured from Pakistan in the 1965 war. (Source: Bangalore News Photos) The M-47 tank was captured from Pakistan in the 1965 war. (Source: Bangalore News Photos)

Bhikiwind is over 2,600 km from Bengaluru. A journey from war to peace, from the hot winds of the north Indian plains to the gentle breeze of a salubrious southern city. That’s how it was, perhaps, for an M-47 Patton tank that now sits placidly on a fork on Victoria Layout, opposite the ASC Centre and College, in the heart of the Karnataka capital. Not a bad deal, perhaps, even if it came with some ignominy.

The Pakistani tank was captured in Bhikiwind, a Punjab town along the border, in the fierce Battle of Assal Uttar in the 1965 India-Pakistan war — in which the surrounding villages are said to have turned into a graveyard of Pakistani Patton tanks. The M-47’s turret has to point downward, in acknowledgement of that defeat. The low profile is apt — it is, after all, a tank in retirement in a city once meant for retired people. It sits on the premises of the Dronacharya Officers’ Mess, barred to outsiders, though it is visible from the footpath abutting it.

This is a military area — the ASC College trains only Army personnel — and the usual restrictions on civilian exuberance apply. “No one can simply come, take pictures,” says Mahesh Kumar, a soldier showing us around.

On this August day, for example, no selfie seekers stop by to frame it in their 10 MP front cameras. No curious schoolboy has stopped in his tracks at the sight of the enemy’s battle machine. Franklin, a Class IX student of Army Public School, housed inside the sprawling ASC Centre and College campus, has his ears plugged into a stream of Badshah songs. He walks by without a second look. “It’s an Indian tank, no?” he says, grinning when he is finally prodded to look. Is it a part of their Independence Day celebrations at school? “No, the tank stays where it is. Maybe it gets cleaned or something,” says M Pritham, Franklin’s classmate, with the breezy nonchalance of the young.

The M-47 does get a daily rub-down, like everything else in the well-oiled Army campus, and an annual coat of paint — its only battle now against the rust that comes every monsoon. “I don’t know anything about it,” says Shobha Tiwari, a primary section teacher at the school. “I am a civilian,” she adds. That logic might not cut much ice with M Jagadesh Kumar, the Vice-Chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University, who recently urged the Centre to install a battle tank on the campus to instill patriotism in his civilian students.

“Where is the space to keep a tank in a civilian area in Bengaluru? It is so congested,” says Narayan Burli, an employee of the Defence Accounts Department, with a look of exasperation at the vehicles that have coalesced near the red light, a few metres away. He, however, seconds the proposal to park one in faraway JNU in Delhi, launching into a short speech about how patriotic fervour has to be created in India where, unlike in Europe, “the nation is more important than the individual”.

“Usually, these war trophies are kept at regimental centres and Army training establishments. They are meant to inspire our cadets, and encourage civilians to join the Army,” says Brigadier Ashok Choudhary, Commandant of the ASC Centre and College. While they are also sometimes displayed in civilian institutions, there is no data on the number of tanks issued to educational institutions, sources in the Army say.

Not much is known about how and when the tank took its modest place opposite the centre. A local tabloid puts the date at 1976, but the Army officials at the centre, more bemused by the interest in a relic past its relevance, could not confirm it. In 1965, the M-47, historian Srinath Raghavan says, would have been part of “some of the fiercest tank battles, after the two World Wars”. But now, he adds, more than their importance in war, tanks have become a symbol of the current need “felt by the armed forces and people outside to force-feed jingoism, nationalism and patriotism”.

Three friends from north India nod gravely at these big questions, but they would rather talk about rotis — and how glad they are to be able to converse in Hindi. “The chappatis here are too thick. Khaane ki bahut pareshani hai (Food is a big problem),” says Sachin, who is from Kanpur, and like his friends, an employee of the Army’s Canteen Stores Department.

The footpath stirs into life in the afternoon, as civilian employees of the military area head for lunch and schoolchildren make their way home. Not a bird has perched on the squat, massive machine in all these hours. The afternoon sun shines on the plaque that announces the brief, inglorious history of M-47. But the butterflies flit around, unconcerned.

Donald Trump endorses merit-based immigration system,"President Donald Trump. (above)

The RAISE Act would scrap the current lottery system to get into the US and instead institute a points-based system for earning a green card. (file) President Donald Trump. (above)The RAISE Act would scrap the current lottery system to get into the US and instead institute a points-based system for earning a green card. (file)

President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced his support for a legislation that would cut in half the number legal immigrants allowed into the US while moving to a “merit-based” system favouring English-speaking skilled workers for residency cards. If passed by the Congress and signed into law, the legislation titled the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act could benefit highly-educated and technology professionals from countries like India.

The RAISE Act would scrap the current lottery system to get into the US and instead institute a points-based system for earning a green card. Factors that would be taken into account include English language skills, education, high-paying job offers and age.

“The RAISE Act will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. It will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to nationals from other countries. Green Cards provide permanent residency, work authorisation, and fast track to citizenship,” Trump said at a White House event to announce his support to the RAISE Act.

Standing along with two top authors of the bill –Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue – Trump said the RAISE Act ends chain migration, and replaces the low-skilled system with a new points-based system for receiving a Green Card.

This competitive application process will favour applicants who can speak English, financially support themselves and their families, and demonstrate skills that will contribute to our economy, he said, adding that the RAISE Act prevents new migrants and new immigrants from collecting welfare, and protects US workers from being displaced.

“That’s a very big thing. They’re not going to come in and just immediately go and collect welfare. That doesn’t happen under the RAISE Act. They can’t do that. Crucially, the Green Card reforms in the RAISE Act will give American workers a pay raise by reducing unskilled immigration,” he said.

Trump said this legislation will not only restore America’s competitive edge in the 21st century, but it will restore the sacred bonds of trust between America and its citizens.

“This legislation demonstrates our compassion for struggling American families who deserve an immigration system that puts their needs first and that puts America first,” he said.

Noting that the current over a half-century old system is “an obsolete disaster”, Senator Cotton said that it is time for it to change.

“First, we bring over a million immigrants into this country a year. That’s like adding the population of Montana every single year; adding the population of Arkansas every three years. The vast majority of those workers — or those immigrants come here not because of their English-language abilities or their job skills, or their job offer, or their educational attainment,” he said.

In fact, only one in 15 out of a million new immigrants come here because of their job skills and their ability to succeed in this economy, Cotton said.

The RAISE Act will be re-orienting Green Card system towards people who can speak English, who have high degrees of educational attainment, who have a job offer that pays more, and a typical job in their local economy, who are going to create a new business, and who are outstanding in their field around the world, he added.

Senator Perdue said the current system does not work. “It keeps America from being competitive, and it does not meet the needs of the economy today,” he said.

“Today we bring in 1.1 million legal immigrants a year. Over 50 per cent of our households of legal immigrants today participate in our social welfare system. Right now, only one 1 out of 15 immigrants who come into our country come in with skills that are employable. We’ve got to change that,” he said.

Perdue said he looked at the at best practices. “We looked at countries like Canada, Australia, and others. What we’re introducing today is modeled on the current Canadian and Australian systems. It’s pro-worker, it’s pro-growth, and it’s been proven to work. Both have been extremely successful in attracting highly skilled workers to those countries,” the Senator said.

“We can all agree that the goals of our nation’s immigration system should be to protect the interests of working Americans, including immigrants, and to welcome talented individuals who come here legally and want to work and make a better life for themselves. Our current system makes it virtually impossible for them to do that,” said the Senator.

According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the higher entry standards established in this proposal will allow authorities to do a more thorough job reviewing applicants for entry, therefore protecting the security of the US homeland.

The additional time spent on vetting each application as a result of this legislation will also ensure that each application serves the national interest, he observed.

“The American people deserve a lawful immigration system that promotes our national interest. The RAISE Act would give us a more merit-based immigration system that admits the best and the brightest around the world while making it harder for people to come here illegally,” Sessions said.

“The bill would end programme known to be rife with fraud and abuse and finally improve the vetting process, making our country and working class wages much safer and stronger,” said the Attorney General.

Parents of Kuheli Chakraborty refuse Rs 30 lakh compensation from Apollo hospital,"Parents of Kuheli Chakraborthy. (Express Photo) Parents of Kuheli Chakraborthy. (Express Photo)

Parents of 4-month-old Kuheli Chakraborty, who had allegedly died due to medical negligence at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals in Kolkata in April, on Saturday refused compensation of Rs 30 lakh from the hospital. On June 23, the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) had asked Apollo Gleneagles to pay compensation to the couple. Parents of Kuheli, Abhijit and Shalu, claimed that while the hospital, in a letter to them, has agreed to pay the compensation, it had denied that their daughter died due to negligence.

The letter, which the couple had received from the hospital on Saturday, stated: “…Any payment to be made by us is without prejudice to our contentious that there has been no negligence of the hospital or attending doctors. Any payment is only in deference to the high office of the commission, the highest regard we have for the government and on compassionate grounds.” “With reference to the judgement and order passed by the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, we are yet to receive the name of the person who will receive the compensation awarded in the judgment, to enable us to make such payment. You are requested to let us know the name of the person who will receive the compensation…” the letter, signed by Apollo Gleneagles Chief Executive Officer Rana Dasgupta, added.

Abhijit, an X-Ray technician, said: “We will not accept the compensation… we only want punishment for the guilty.”

“We are not beggars. We received a letter through post, which says that the hospital is ready to pay compensation but has denied that there was any negligence on its part. If that is the case, then why is it paying compensation? I don’t want any mother to go through the pain I have suffered. If possible, I will approach higher authorities,” said Shalu.

Kuheli was admitted to ESI Joka Hospital on April 13 after her parents noticed blood in her stool. On April 15, she was shifted to Apollo. Four days later, she was declared dead.

Her parents had claimed they took Kuheli to Apollo for a colonoscopy, for which the hospital allegedly kept her on an empty stomach for two consecutive days and later gave her anaesthesia.

Tottenham Hotspur’s KieranTrippier limps off in Juventus friendly,"Kieran Trippier went off after 41 minutes. (Source: Reuters file) Kieran Trippier went off after 41 minutes. (Source: Reuters file)

Tottenham Hotspur’s England right back Kieran Trippier limped off with an ankle injury just before halftime in a 2-0 friendly win over Italian champions Juventus at Wembley on Saturday.

Last season’s Premier League runners-up sold fellow England full back Kyle Walker to Manchester City for 50 million pounds ($65.18 million) last month with Trippier a ready-made replacement.

But the 26-year-old, signed from Burnley two years ago, went off after 41 minutes, having twice been hurt in tackles with Alex Sandro, and left the ground on crutches in a protective boot.

“We need to assess him on Monday and then we will see,” manager Mauricio Pochettino told reporters.

“Now the feeling is good. It’s true that he has crutches, but it’s good. We hope that it is not a big issue.”

Trippier recovered from his first clash with Juve left back Sandro and set up the opening goal for Harry Kane with a precise cross after 10 minutes but had to go off after the second clash.

He was replaced by 20-year-old Kyle Walker-Peters before Christian Eriksen scored Tottenham’s second goal in the 52nd minute against last season’s Champions League finalists.

Spurs visit promoted Newcastle United in their opening Premier League game of the season next Sunday.

Antonio Conte wants more signings,"Antonio Conte says he is not satisfied with the depth of his squad. (Source: Reuters) Antonio Conte says he is not satisfied with the depth of his squad. (Source: Reuters)

Chelsea manager Antonio Conte says he is not satisfied with the depth of his squad, a week ahead of the defence of the Premier League title won in May.

“It’s very important to try to improve our squad, we have a small squad,” he told a news conference ahead of Sunday’s Community Shield match against FA Cup holders Arsenal at Wembley.

“I think only one player is not enough to improve our team. We need more players, not at top level like Neymar, more players to improve our quality.”

Conte, who took the title to Stamford Bridge in his first season, has so far signed four players: defender Antonio Rudiger from Roma, midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko (Monaco) and striker Alvaro Morata (Real Madrid), plus back-up goalkeeper Willy Caballero (Manchester City).

Chelsea have lost former captain John Terry to Championship (second tier) club Aston Villa and Nemanja Matic to Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United, as well as a number of squad players.

They have a net spend estimated at only 22 million pounds ($28.76 million), compared to Arsenal’s £43 million, Manchester City’s £182 million and United’s £136 million.

The chances of striker Diego Costa staying at the club diminished further this week when reports in Spain quoted Costa’s lawyer as saying the player would formally ask for a transfer.

Costa has claimed that the manager only told him by text message in June that he no longer figures in Chelsea’s plans, but a Chelsea spokesman described that as “nonsense” on Friday, adding that the player and his agent knew in January that he would be allowed to leave.

The record signing of Morata makes it less likely that the volatile Costa will play. Conte said of Sunday’s traditional Wembley meeting between the champions and FA Cup winners: “This is the first trophy of the season. It’s an important game. We want to play a good game with good intensity.”

Arsenal beat their London rivals 2-1 in the FA Cup final in May, to deny them a League and Cup double. In the opening Premier league games next weekend Arsenal are at home to Leicester City and Chelsea play Burnley.

Five states that refused to join India after Independence,"The princely states, both pampered and exploited by the British, maintained a position of semi-autonomy under the colonisers and were the toughest challenge facing free India. (Wikimedia Commons) The princely states, both pampered and exploited by the British, maintained a position of semi-autonomy under the colonisers and were the toughest challenge facing free India. (Wikimedia Commons)

The midnight of August 15, 1947 is perhaps noted as the most significant in the pages of Indian history. In the words of Jawaharlal Nehru, India awoke to life and freedom. But if freedom is the hard earned dream come true for the nationalist leaders of India, then stitching together the hundreds of territorial pieces into a distinct whole was an aspiration much harder to realise and as of August 15, lay yet unfulfilled. The departure of the British from Indian territory was accompanied by the question of how to bring together the 500-odd chiefdoms and states they had left behind.

The princely states, both pampered and exploited by the British, maintained a position of semi-autonomy under the colonisers and were the toughest challenge facing free India. Remarking upon the complicated relationship between the princes and the British, historian Barbara Ramusack notes “British colonial officials had claimed them as faithful military allies, denounced them as autocrats, praised them as natural leaders of their subjects, chided them as profligate playboys, and taken advantage of their lavish hospitality.” For the British these states were the necessary allies, to keep in check the rise of their common enemy, the French. Accordingly, the princes were given autonomy over their territories, but the British acquired for themselves the right to appoint ministers and get military support as and when required.

(Wikimedia Commons)

Once the withdrawal of the British was announced, the issue of the princely states had to be settled for the new government that would be in power. By the late 1930s itself, the Congress had made clear their intention of integrating the states into the Indian union. In the 1938 Haripura session of the Congress, the objective was made clear in the following words:

“The Congress stands for the same political, social and economic freedom in the States as in the rest of India and considers the States as integral parts of India which cannot be separated. The Purna Swaraj or complete independence, which is the objective of the Congress, is for the whole of India, inclusive of the States, for the integrity and unity of India must be maintained in freedom as it has been maintained in subjection.”

To aid in the process a new states department was set up with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as its head and V. P. Menon as the secretary. Together they, under the guidance of Lord Mountbatten, were given the responsibility to coax, cajole and convince the princes to accede to the Indian union. Bikaner, Baroda and few other states from Rajasthan were the first ones to join the union. Alternatively, there were several other states that were adamant to not shake hands with India. Some of them thought this to be the best moment to acquire independent statehood, while there were others who wanted to become a part of Pakistan. Here are the cases of five states that opposed the idea of joining India.

Travancore

The southern Indian maritime state was one of the first princely states to refuse accession to the Indian union and question the Congress’ leadership of the nation. The state was strategically placed for maritime trade and was rich in both human and mineral resources.

Sir C. P. Ramamswamy Aiyar (Wikimedia Commons) Sir C. P. Ramamswamy Aiyar (Wikimedia Commons)

Sir C. P. Ramamswamy Aiyar, the dewan of Travancore and a distinguished lawyer by profession, had by 1946 declared his intention of forming an independent state of Travancore that would be open to the idea of signing a treaty with the Indian union. Historian Ramachandra Guha notes that Travancore’s bid to independence was in fact propelled by Mohammed Ali Jinnah. Sir C.P. Aiyar is also said to have had secret ties with the UK government who were in support of an independent Travancore in the hope that they would get exclusive access to a mineral called monazite that the area was rich in, and would give an edge to Britain in the nuclear arms race. While the Dewan stuck to his position till as late as July 1947, he changed his mind soon after he survived an assassination attempt by a member of the Kerala Socialist Party. On July 30 1947, Travancore joined India.

Jodhpur

The Rajput princely state of Jodhpur was a strange case of tilting towards Pakistan despite having a Hindu king and a large Hindu population. While the prince, Maharaja Hanvant Singh, was strong in his willingness to join India, he somehow got the idea that it might be more beneficial for him to join Pakistan on account of the fact that his state shared border with the soon to be born country. Further, he was lured into joining Pakistan by Jinnah who offered him full port facilities in Karachi along with military and agrarian support. However, when Vallabhbhai Patel was made aware of the possibility of Jodhpur going to Pakistan, he immediately contacted the prince and offered him sufficient benefits and explained to him the problems of joining a Muslim state. Eventually the Jodhpur prince was won back. Historian Ramchandra Guha, in his work “India after Gandhi”, notes that on being presented with the Instrument of Accession, the Jodhpur prince dramatically took out a revolver and held it on the secretary’s head saying, “I will not accept your dictation”. However, few minutes later he calmed down and signed the document.

Bhopal

Another state that wished to declare independence was Bhopal, which had a Muslim Nawab, Hamidullah Khan, ruling over a majority Hindu population. A close friend of the Muslim League, the Nawab was staunchly opposed to Congress rule. He had made clear his decision to attain independence to Mountbatten. However, the latter wrote back to him stating that “no ruler could run away from the dominion closest to him”. By July 1947, the prince became aware of the large number of princes who had acceded to India and decided to follow suit.

Hyderabad

The case of Hyderabad was by far the most significant and complicated challenge among the princely states. Lying in the Deccan plateau, the state covered a large portion of the centre of India. During the independence of the country, Nizam Mir Usman Ali was presiding over a largely Hindu population. When the British decided to leave, the Nizam was very clear on his demand for an independent state and consequently becoming a member of the British commonwealth of nations. Lord Mountbatten, however, made it very clear that the Crown would not agree to Hyderabad becoming member of the British commonwealth, except through either of the two new dominions.

While the tussle over Hyderabad grew stronger over time, violence and demonstrations across the state became a regular feature. The Nizam also drew support from Jinnah who pledged to defend the oldest Muslim dynasty in India. For Patel, however, an independent Hyderabad was equivalent to having cancer in the belly of India.

Once Lord Mountbatten resigned in June 1948, the Congress government decided to make a more decisive turn. On September 13, Indian troops were sent to Hyderabad in what came to be known as ‘Operation Polo’. In an armed encounter that lasted for about four days, the Indian army gained full control of the state. Later, in an attempt to reward the Nizam for his submission, he was made the governor of the state of Hyderabad.

Junagadh

Apart from Hyderabad, there was one more state that had not acceded to the Indian union by August 15, 1947, the Gujarati state of Junagadh. Junagadh was the most important among the group of Kathiawar states. Here too, the Nawab, Muhammad Mahabat Khanji III ruled over a large Hindu population. However, when on July 25, 1947 Lord Mountbatten addressed the princes, the Dewan of Junagadh had made very clear his decision to advise the Nawab on joining the Indian union.

In early 1947, the Dewan of Junagadh, Nabi Baksh invited Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto of the Muslim league to join the state council of minister. In the absence of the existing dewan, Bhutto took over the office and pressed the Nawab to accede to Pakistan. When Pakistan accepted Junagadh’s request for accession, the Indian leaders were enraged as it went against Jinnah’s two nation theory.

The disturbed situation in Junagadh led to a complete breakdown of the economy and consequently the Nawab fled to Karachi. Vallabhbhai Patel requested Pakistan to allow a plebiscite in Junagadh and eventually sent in troops to force annexation of three of its principalities. In the face of acute shortage of funds and forces, the Dewan was forced to accede to the Indian government. Eventually, on February 20, 1948, a plebiscite was held in the state wherein 91 percent of the voters chose to join India.

John McCain says he expects to return to Senate next month,"Arizona Sen. John McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer recently. (AP Photo/File) Arizona Sen. John McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer recently. (AP Photo/File)

Arizona Sen. John McCain said in a radio interview Wednesday that he hates the healthy diet his wife and daughter are forcing on him as he fights an aggressive form of brain cancer but expects to return to the Senate next month. McCain made the remarks in his first extended interview with Arizona media since his diagnosis last month. On KFYI radio’s Mike Broomhead show, the Republican said he’s facing a tough challenge but the best thing to do when facing adversity is to stay busy. He said plans to do just that during the August congressional recess.

“It’s a tough challenge, you know, of course,” McCain said. “But I’m getting the best care you could possibly have, I’m eating well, I’m feeling fine, getting plenty of exercise. I expect Congress to go out here pretty soon, and I’ll be ready to go back to work in September.”

McCain began chemotherapy and radiation treatment for glioblastoma on Monday. The senator said he plans meetings and regular travel this month.

His remarks came a week after he returned to the Senate and gave a rousing speech blasting partisanship and the one-sided push to repeal former President Barack Obama’s health care law. Days later, he cast the deciding vote that stopped GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s “skinny repeal” bill.

McCain said Wednesday that he campaigned for “repeal and replace” of the health law and the Senate plan was repeal and “not replace.”

“What we were going to do, and its gets a little arcane, but take a ‘skinny bill’ as they called it and give it to a conference of House and Senate people,” McCain said. “With no input, no amendments, and then have them put out a product that was going to be an up-or-down vote in both House and Senate.

“I wanted us to have a full-fledged debate, amendments, go through committees,” he said. “That’s the way we should operate.”

McCain said he was buoyed by news that the Republican chairman of the Senate health committee and the top committee Democrat agreed to hold bipartisan hearings on a new push.

“It will be, I think, a consensus bill that comes out to the floor. That’s our only shot right now, honestly,” he said.

McCain said he wanted to protect Arizona’s Medicaid program and had three amendments in hand proposed by Gov. Doug Ducey. When it became clear they could not be added, he voted no.

“But, having said that, it is imploding in Arizona,” McCain said. “There’s only one provider per county, the premiums are going up, the deductibles are going up. So we have to fix it, but we have to fix it in the right way so that I protect the state of Arizona.”

At the end of the segment, McCain spoke of his life and his legacy.

“Look, I am the luckiest person that you will ever have on your show, ever,” McCain said. “And I am very aware of that, and I am very happy. For a guy who stood at the bottom of his class at the naval academy, we’ve come a hell of a long way.”

"Donald Trump signs bill imposing sanctions on Russia, Iran, North Korea","US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

Under mounting domestic pressure, President Donald Trump today signed into law a legislation that imposes tough sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea and limits his ability to lift the curbs unilaterally. “I favour tough measures to punish and deter bad behaviour by the rogue regimes in Tehran and Pyongyang. I also support making clear that America will not tolerate interference in our democratic process, and that we will side with our allies and friends against Russian subversion and destabilisation,” Trump said in a statement after he signed the ‘Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act’.

The bill sanctions Russia — citing its cyberhacking as well as aggression in Ukraine and Syria — while also slapping new sanctions on North Korea and Iran.

The legislation limits the ability of the president to lift the sanctions unilaterally. The signing of the bill put to rest questions about whether Trump would support the legislation passed overwhelmingly by Congress last week while he still excoriated the measure as “significantly flawed.”

Trump said the bill was seriously flawed – particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch’s authority to negotiate. “Congress could not even negotiate a healthcare bill after seven years of talking. By limiting the Executive’s flexibility, this bill makes it harder for the US to strike good deals for the American people, and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together,” he argued.

Yet despite its problems, Trump said, he is signing the bill for the sake of national unity. “It represents the will of the American people to see Russia take steps to improve relations with the United States. We hope there will be cooperation between our two countries on major global issues so that these sanctions will no longer be necessary,” said the US president.

The sanctions targets the Russian energy sector, giving the US the ability to sanction companies involved in developing Russian pipelines, and placing curbs on some Russian weapons exporters.

The sanctions seek to penalise the Kremlin for meddling in the 2016 US presidential election — which Trump won — and Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

In his signing statement, Trump alleged that in its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions. The bill prescribes a review period that precludes the president from taking certain actions, he asserted.

After Trump’s signing of the bill, Senator Rob Portman said by doing so the US made important progress toward holding Russia, Iran, and North Korea accountable for their aggressive and destabilising behaviour. “I am pleased President Trump signed this legislation, which includes my priorities to counter Russian propaganda and disinformation, into law,” he said.

These countries actively undermine US allies and interests and this legislation sends a clear signal that their actions have consequences and that the US stands with its allies around the world, he added. “The important sanctions and policies included in this law will also provide constructive guidance to the administration as it continues to formulate its foreign policy. The US must demonstrate a firm and principled approach to Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and this law helps us do just that,” Portman said.

Rory McIlroy hopeful form could be back after debut with new caddie,"Rory McIlroy will have a new caddie on his bag at the World Golf Championships Bridgestone Invitational this week. (Source: AP) Rory McIlroy will have a new caddie on his bag at the World Golf Championships Bridgestone Invitational this week. (Source: AP)

Four-times major winner Rory McIlroy has said he feels he could be close to returning to top form after shooting a three-under-par first round of 67 at the World Golf Championship-Bridgestone Invitational in Akron, Ohio.

The 28-year-old Northern Irishman, who has not won since claiming the Tour Championship and FedExCup title last September and last won a major in 2014, said he felt his round, which left him two shots behind first round leader Thomas Pieters, was just a couple of shots away from what he was looking for.

“I’m capable. With a couple of better wedge shots it could have been a really low score, but I played OK. I drove it well. I shot a 67,” he said. “It’s there, just a matter of repeatedly doing that and being a little more consistent.”

One big difference to his game was the absence of long-time caddie JP Fitzgerald, whom he split from after the British Open, following nine years working together. Fitzgerald’s replacement for this tournament and the upcoming PGA Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, is McIlroy’s best friend Harry Diamond.

“It was good. A little weird at the start,” McIlroy said about the new partnership with Diamond. “Obviously, it’s been nine years since I’ve had anyone else on my bag. Just hearing a different voice it’s a little different. But we did well out there.

“We consulted each other when we needed to and I sort of took on my own stuff when I felt like I was good. Then whatever decisions I made, whether they were good or bad, was on me so I didn’t have anyone to get frustrated at other than myself.”

McIlroy said taking more accountability was an aim of his and could spark his game. “I think just being cognizant of where I’m pitching certain shots, and where they’re finishing and if you could just get into that shot a little bit more it might make you a little more committed to hitting that shot,” he said.

“I hadn’t written anything in the yardage book for a long time so it was good to get back to that and just take ownership a little bit more.”

Sri Lanka seamer Nuwan Pradeep ruled out of India series,"Nuwan Pradeep was ruled out of the Test series against India. (Source: AP) Nuwan Pradeep was ruled out of the Test series against India. (Source: AP)

Injuries continue to hurt Sri Lanka in the ongoing Test series against India. The hosts have now suffered another blow as seamer Nuwan Pradeep has become a new addition to the list. Pradeep bowled 17 overs on the opening day of the second Test against India in Colombo before he went out of the field complaining about a hamstring niggle. On Friday, it was confirmed that he would be out of action for 1-2 months.

“Nuwan Pradeep’s out for one or two months,” Sri Lankan opener Dimuth Karunaratne said at the press-conference.

Skipper Dinesh Chandimal missed the first Test due to pneumonia while Asela Gunaratne was also ruled out of the Test series against India after breaking his thumb during Galle Test. Even Rangana Herath had injury concerns in the first Test when he was hit on his finger while trying to stop a drive from Indian skipper Virat Kohli. Though he was eventually declared fit for the Colombo Test and scalped four Indian wickets in first innings.

Karunaratne said that he is ready to bowl since he started his career as a bowler only.

“I started my career as a bowler, not as a batsman, so I can bowl. The thing is there are a lot of bowlers who can bowl faster than 130-135,” Karunaratne who scalped the important wicket of Cheteshwar Pujara on Day 2 added.

“We played only with once pace option, so when they asked me if we need to bowl a few overs with the new ball, I said I could. That’s why I bowled a few overs with Chaminda Vaas to see how it goes,” he said.

India so far lead the three-match Test series 1-0 and they have been dominating the second encounter as well. Virat Kohli’s troops compiled a total of 622/9 before the declaration was made. The visitors later bagged two Sri Lankan wickets before stumps on Day 2.

Arun Jaitley raises voting rights issue with Sports Minister Vijay Goel,"Arun Jaitley is Minister of Finance and Defence. Arun Jaitley is Minister of Finance and Defence.

The removal of voting rights of Railways and Services in national sporting bodies and Indian Olympic Association has become a bone of contention with Arun Jaitley writing to Sports Minister Vijay Goel seeking a reversal of its order. This comes after railways minister Suresh Prabhu made a similar plea. In his letter, the Minister of Finance and Defence Jaitely has said removal of voting rights may have an adverse impact in the long run. Jaitley in his letter has batted for both Services and the Railways, which employs 3,000 sportspersons, including most of the star players of the current women’s cricket team.

Through letters to all national federations in February and in subsequent months, the sports ministry had revoked the voting rights of the Railway Sports Promotion Board and the Services Sports Control Board because as per the National Sports Code of 2011, each state should have only one vote. “Voting rights give an organisation a desired say in governing body and player difficulties and issues brought out during camps/championships are resolved as equals,” Jaitley’s letter, reviewed by The Indian Express, says.

“The rational behind the decision or benefits/advantages of removing the voting rights of the most performing organizations is not clear,” Jaitley has written.

Neymar completed his blockbuster transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint Germain on Thursday evening in a deal that shattered the record for the previous most expensive signing by more than a double when Manchester United splashed the cash for Paul Pogba. With the 222 million Euros, that PSG paid as part of Neymar’s release clause, he has now become the most expensive player in the world. At the Parisian club, the Brazilian star would earn $350 million in salary and bonus before-tax.

Many have speculated and called out the midfielder for the move by questioning the intent of the move even though Neymar said in a statement that he was going for newer challenges. “What I say to these people is they don’t know anything about my personal life, I was never motivated by money. What I think about is my happiness and together with my family, I want them to be happy. If I was following the money, I would be somewhere else, with other clubs in other countries. I’m really sad that people still think that way and I’m glad that PSG believe in me,” he said on Friday after being presented as a PSG player at Parc des Princes.

“This is for ambition, they have a similar ambition to mine. I want something bigger, a bigger challenge and my heart made that decision and made me follow. That is why I am here. I want to give my best to help the club win trophies. I wanted to come to Paris and it was only linked to finding a new challenge. It is not because I was not THE star at Barcelona, I fitted in very well there. This is not what I am looking for here. PSG deserve trophies and I will have new trophies, this is what motivates me, I want to dream bigger,” he added.

PSG chairman Nasser Al Khelaifi who sat alongside Neymar at the presentation echoed the thought. He added that the biggest transfer now may be worth the money ‘in two or three years’. “Today is expensive but in two or three years? I do not think it is expensive, we will definitely make more money. This is the power of PSG. It is an amazing transfer. We will be very transparent with Financial Fair Play, I have a strong team with me. If you are thinking about it, go have a coffee and don’t worry about it,” he said.

There were reports that Neymar’s decision to move away from Barcelona came when he saw Lionel Messi, his striking partner at Barcelona, take the limelight following a miraculous comeback against PSG in the UEFA Champions League last season. That draw comparisons whether Neymar wanted to step out of Messi’s shadow. However, Neymar denied such claims and said his reason to join Barcelona was to play alongside the Argentine. “No, quite on the contrary. One of my motivations to play for Barcelona was to play alongside Lionel Messi, he was my role model. There was no pressure at all there, only during the first week at Barcelona where I was nervous to train with my role models.”

“But after that first week, I was relaxed and to play with the best is very easy because every player wants to play with the best in the world to win titles together. I want to thank Messi because he welcomed me so well and I learned so much from him in our four years together. But now I’m here at PSG and I want to help my team-mate in the best way and win titles,” he said. Messi posted an emotional farewell video after Neymar bid the players goodbye at the club’s Sporting City in Barcelona.

Neymar signed for PSG until 2022 in a five-year deal and PSG chairman Al Khelaifi confirmed that the Brazilian has a release clause in his contract with the French club. The transfer has been embroiled in controversy on most part with Spanish La Liga threatening to file complaint against PSG over the transfer and the possible abuse of the financial fair play (FFP) rules. Neymar had officially notified Barcelona of his intent to leave the Catalans on Wednesday and the move was completed in just over a day.

PSG chief Al Khalifi said the club will comply with UEFA on following the FFP regulations. “”There is only one decision that matters and that is with UEFA. We are working very transparently with UEFA. We don’t care about speculation in the media. We care that what we are doing is transparent and completely legal,” he stated.

Disappointment as Davis Cup reform flops,"International Tennis Federation (ITF) president David Haggerty said he had concerns over the futures of the historic tournaments.

The head of tennis’s governing body expressed disappointment today as a key move to revamp the Davis Cup and Fed Cup competitions failed to win approval.

International Tennis Federation (ITF) president David Haggerty said he had concerns over the futures of the historic tournaments after the unsuccessful attempt to cut singles matches from five to three sets.

The ITF’s annual general meeting in Ho Chi Minh City approved three other measures, and 63.54 percent of voters backed the move to three tiebreak sets — just short of the two-thirds majority required.

“We respect the decision of the AGM but are disappointed that our member nations have not approved the full package of Davis Cup and Fed Cup reforms endorsed by the ITF Board,” Haggerty said in a statement.

“Change is needed to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, and we remain committed to working with our national associations and other stakeholders on finding ways to enhance the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.”

Reducing singles matches to three sets had been seen as important to make the men’s and women’s international team competitions more viewer-friendly in a congested sports schedule.

The 117-year-old Davis Cup and the Fed Cup, which dates from 1963, often struggle to attract the spotlight in a sport which focuses on the four Grand Slam tournaments and has busy men’s and women’s tours.

The ITF meeting approved a move to give Davis and Fed Cup finalists the choice of hosting their first-round ties the following year.

The availability of match and practice courts was reduced to make hosting cheaper, while Davis Cup pre-tie player commitments were cut to a single function combining the draw, media interviews and an official lunch.

President’s transcripts leak is a matter of national security: White House,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s telephonic conversations with leaders of Mexico and Australia was published by an American daily on Thursday. (Source: AP, File) U.S. President Donald Trump’s telephonic conversations with leaders of Mexico and Australia was published by an American daily on Thursday. (Source: AP, File)

The leak of transcripts of telephonic conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia is a national security matter, the White House has said. It was referring to the yesterday’s incident of a leading American daily posting highly classified transcripts of Trump’s conversations with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

“It’s a national security matter when phone call transcripts are being leaked out. It prevents the president from being able to do what he does best, and negotiate with foreign leaders,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters told reporters yesterday abroad Air Force One travelling with Trump to West Virginia.

The White House officials, however, refused to comment on the specific leaks of the conversation, which was posted by The Washington Post on its website.

“What I can tell you regarding the border wall is that the president spoke about this on the campaign, continues to echo it now, and having a secure border is … something that he had promised his supporters and has continued to focus on making sure that we have a secure border,” she said.

The leaks of the presidential conversation has been condemned by even Trump’s critics.

“This is beyond the pale and will have a chilling effect going forward on the ability of the commander-in-chief to have candid discussions with his counterparts,” Ned Price, a former National Security Council official under President Barack Obama, told The Hill.

“Granted, the White House contributed to this atmosphere by welcoming the free-for-all environment, where anonymous leaks are commonplace. But we must draw the line somewhere,” Price was quoted as saying.

“I would’ve lost my mind if transcripts of Obama’s calls to foreign leaders leaked. He wouldn’t have sounded so dumb, but it’s still absurd,” said Tommy Vietor, another former spokesman of the National Security Council under the Obama Administration.

David Frum, a speech writer to the former US President George W Bush said that the president’s opponents do a “lasting damage” to American security when they violate norms to undermine him.

“Leaking the transcript of a presidential call to a foreign leader is unprecedented, shocking, and dangerous. It is vitally important that a president be able to speak confidentially, and perhaps even more important that foreign leaders understand that they can reply in confidence,” he wrote in The Atlantic magazine.

Frum said that the leak will reverberate around the world.

“No leader will again speak candidly on the phone to Washington, DC —- at least for the duration of this presidency, and perhaps for longer,” he said.

US Attorney General Jeff Sessions along with his top intelligence officials are scheduled to have a press conference on leaks today. The presser was however scheduled before The Washington Post released the transcripts of the presidential conversation.

Democratic Senator Mark Warner, who is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, expressed apprehensions that the leak may be “reflective of a chaotic White House” and demanded that the president should investigate the leaks.

“While the leak may be reflective of a chaotic White House, it still constituted a massive breach of norms and was serious enough to merit a congressional inquiry. Whether that is Intel or Judicial (committees) looking into it, somebody ought to,” Warner told The Daily Beast in an interview.

"Bigg Boss Telugu: Rana Daggubati makes grand entry as Raja Jogendra, surpises Bigg Boss housemates","Bigg Boss Telugu: Rana Daggubati to visit Jr NTR show to promote Nene Raju Nene Mantri. Bigg Boss Telugu: Rana Daggubati to visit Jr NTR show to promote Nene Raju Nene Mantri.

Rana Daggubati, who has been promoting his upcoming Telugu film Nene Raju Nene Mantri, has now headed to Bigg Boss Telugu season 1 to meet and greet the house members as Raja Jogendra, his character from the film. Rana, who also hosts a chat show on Gemini TV, would be sharing the screen space with his contemporary, Jr NTR, for the first time, who made his debut with Bigg Boss Telugu three weeks ago. Rana would go inside the Bigg Boss house and spend some time with the contestants. He would also assign some task for the entertainment of the audiences as well as the housemates.

Ever since Bigg Boss Telugu went on-air, the show has been doing really well in terms of TRPs. The audiences have been giving thumbs up to Jr NTR’s hosting. Recently, the actor also celebrated the success of his show’s first week. A weekly quoted a source saying, “It is the most expensive show to ever be created in Telugu television. It has one of the largest sets, with more than 10,000 sq ft area and nearly 750 people working on the project at any given point of time.”

While Bigg Boss Telugu is setting a momentum in terms of getting its own dedicated viewers, it lacks the kind of popularity Bigg Boss Tamil has achieved. While Jr NTR is doing really well as a host, the contestants have not been able to make a connection with audiences as even after two weeks, none of the housemates have risen to fame and popularity. Meanwhile, on the Tamil show, celebrity contestant Oviya has won hearts and her popularity knows no bound. The entire Tamil Nadu stood in her support but she chose to walk out of the show after a series of events she had to tackle inside the house.

Meanwhile, it is to be seen among the nominated contestants of Bigg Boss Telugu, including Sameer, Mumaith Khan, Kalpana and Archana, who would be the second contestant to be evicted from the house.

South Korea spy agency admits attempting to rig 2012 election,"The December 2012 presidential election was won by his now-disgraced Park Geun-Hye, who defeated liberal Moon Jae-In. (Reuters Photo, File) The December 2012 presidential election was won by his now-disgraced Park Geun-Hye, who defeated liberal Moon Jae-In. (Reuters Photo, File)

South Korea’s spy agency has admitted that it had engaged in a far-reaching attempt to manipulate voters as it sought to help conservatives win parliamentary and presidential elections. In-house investigators from the National Intelligence Service (NIS) confirmed that the agency’s cyber warfare unit organised and operated up to 30 teams for more than two years in the run-up to the 2012 elections, the agency said in a statement late Thursday.

They hired internet-savvy civilians and sought to sway voter opinions through postings on portals and Twitter.

“The teams were charged with spreading pro-government opinions and suppressing anti-government views, branding them as pro-North Korean forces’ attempts to disturb state affairs”, it said.

At the time the country was led by the conservative Lee Myung-Bak, and in the event the December 2012 presidential election was won by his now-disgraced colleague Park Geun-Hye, who defeated liberal Moon Jae-In. Moon won South Korea’s presidential vote in May this year after Park was impeached and dismissed over corruption and abuse of power, and ordered an investigation.

He has vowed to reform the NIS to prevent it meddling in elections and make it focus on collecting and analysing intelligence on North Korea and foreign affairs.

A spokesman for Park’s party, now in opposition and renamed Liberty Korea, said Friday the inquiry was “politically motivated”.

“The NIS says it will dissociate itself from politics but it is meddling in politics again by starting this probe,” Kang Hyo-Sang said in a statement.

Former NIS chief Won Sei-Hoon is being tried for the second time for leading an online smear campaign against Moon, after his initial conviction was overturned on appeal.

But the NIS investigation results suggest the scale of the voter manipulation was far wider than previously thought.

The internal probe also found Won ordered the agency to muzzle the press, provide support for pro-government conservative civic groups and put some major opposition politicians under secret surveillance.

The modern-day NIS has been tainted by a series of scandals, including the forging of documents to build a false spying case against a former Seoul city official who had escaped to South Korea from the North in 2004.

Kosovo faces potential political crisis,"Kosovo faces potential political crisis after its new parliament failed to elect a speaker, casting doubt on whether the coalition that won June’s snap polls can muster a majority. The choice of speaker is key because it shows whether the coalition, including ex-rebel commanders in Kosovo’s war of independence, can gather the votes to pick a prime minister.

The alliance, dubbed the “war wing”, won the most seats in the June 11 vote, but accounts for only 39 out of 120 in parliament. The nationalist leftist Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) party followed with 32 seats, with the centre-right League of Democratic Kosovo (LDK) third on 29.

They refuse to enter into an alliance with the “war wing”, which has prevented the formation of a stable government. Election of the speaker is a key step to constitute the parliament and pave the way for the president to name a prime minister.

The premier-designate then has 15 days to propose a cabinet and have it approved by a majority of 120-member parliament. The failure to vote on a speaker has left observers worried that Kosovo could be headed for fresh elections.

If Self-determination and the LDK-led coalition do not support the “war wing” then “Kosovo could go to new elections,” said political analyst Ramush Tahiri.

Kosovo, a former Serbian province whose 1.8 million-strong population are mainly ethnic Albanians, is one of the poorest countries in Europe. It declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after the 1998-1999 independence war that ended after a 11-week long NATO bombing campaign against Serbia.

The war left 13,000 people dead, the vast majority of them ethnic Albanians. More than 110 countries have recognised Kosovo’s independence including the United States and most European Union members, but Serbia has refused to do so.

Second Nature,"Indira Gandhi with a tiger cub, Teen Murti House, 1956-57. (Courtesy: Simon & Schuster) Indira Gandhi with a tiger cub, Teen Murti House, 1956-57. (Courtesy: Simon & Schuster)

Title: Indira Gandhi: A Life in Nature

Author: Jairam Ramesh

Publisher: Simon & Schuster

Pages: 437

Price: Rs 799

We think of Indira Gandhi’s years in the wilderness as the period in the Opposition, 1977-1980, but setting apart the figure of speech, Jairam Ramesh’s book reminds us that she had a very real, lifelong relationship with the wild, which informed the ecological policies established under her rule. Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, whom he plied with books on natural history and wildlife (apart from those famous letters), were perhaps the only Indian prime ministers who could tell a blue-fronted redstart from a red-vented bulbul. And if the father is remembered for promoting big dams and heavy industry, the daughter was alive to the environmental cost of development. In the Sixties and Seventies, she framed these concerns precisely as we do now, 50 years later.

A vocal member of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS, which publishes the books of Salim Ali, who was a mentor to Gandhi), she was also a founding member of the Delhi Birdwatching Society. Her tenure as prime minister coincided with the rise of the global environmental movement (by way of reference, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring appeared in 1962, and Gandhi took office four years later), and the founding principles of India’s conservation movement were set under her rule. With a wealth of detail culled from the archives, Ramesh establishes that she was the right person in the right place at the right time. Her personal interest in conservation steered India’s green policy, created institutions like the Indian Forest Service (constituted in 1966, the year she became PM) and ensured the environmental security of havens like Chilka Lake and the Keoladeo Ghana Bird Sanctuary in Bharatpur.

Ramesh begs to differ with Ramachandra Guha, who had attributed Indira Gandhi’s interest in birds to the American pacifist and ornithologist Horace Alexander, Mahatma Gandhi’s friend and founder of the Delhi Birdwatching Society, who had done fieldwork in what is now Nagaland with Sidney Dillon Ripley (who would later win acclaim as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution). Ramesh traces Gandhi’s ornithological interests back to 1942, when she was an inmate at Naini Central Prison, Allahabad.

In 1941, Salim Ali had met Nehru in Dehra Dun, where he was jailed, and gave him an autographed copy of his new work, The Book of Indian Birds. Decades later, Gandhi alluded to the influence of the classic and Stanley Henry Prater’s Book of Indian Animals in her speech at the BNHS’s centenary celebrations, adding, “But I did not know much about birds until the high walls of Naini prison shut us off from them and for the first time, I paid attention to bird songs. I noted the sounds and later on after my release, my father sent me Dr Salim Ali’s book and I was able to identify the birds.”

Gandhi’s approach to conservation was graduated. In 1958, before she became PM, she wrote an article in the Sunday Statesman about a trip to Manali, urging against reckless modernisation. She suggested that the Kullu valley could be reserved for trekkers and nature lovers, while city slickers should go to pukka hill stations like Simla and Mussoorie.

She seems to have rejected the government versus activist model which now polarises the issue. Apart from naturalists, she was sympathetic to grassroots activists like Sundarlal Bahuguna. In 1981, she sent him a taped public statement backing his padayatra from Kashmir to Kohima, warning of the dangers of denuding the hills.

Quite often, in acting on an environmental issue, Gandhi was guided by the reports and appeals of foreign agencies, activists and researchers, who are now regarded with instinctive suspicion by the government. Indeed, when Western researchers found it impossible to get visas for geopolitical reasons, the norms were relaxed for environmental and conservation projects.

Project Tiger was proposed by the British conservationist Guy Mountfort’s World Wildlife Fund. He understood that it would not fly without the PM’s backing, and sought an audience. He was pleasantly surprised to find a task force constituted the very next morning, and a meeting scheduled within 48 hours.

According to Ramesh’s research, Ashok Khosla, the physicist behind the concept of sustainable development, joined the fledgeling Department of Science and Technology on the recommendation of his professor at Harvard, the celebrated Roger Revelle. He standardised the environmental impact assessment of projects, nurtured NGOs and established Development Alternatives.

After the debacle of 1977, two of Gandhi’s last communications before demitting office concerned the environment. One was to the petroleum minister, concerning oil prospecting in the Sunderbans and warning of the damage that a spill would cause to Project Tiger. The other reminded the chief minister of Assam, who proposed to clear forests and institute the monoculture of commercially profitable species, of the implications for water management and climate change across borders.

While the Indian conservation movement is the sum total of the work of thousands of people, from maharajas who put down the hunting rifle in favour of the camera, to farmers and foresters who saw the implications of environmental damage at first hand, Jairam Ramesh suggests that it was accelerated and given intelligent direction by Indira Gandhi. She was guided by a direct, immediate connection with the outdoors, which she shared with her father. She had travelled widely in the wild and at home in Teen Murti House, she had helped maintain Nehru’s menagerie, which at one time included three tiger cubs and Sanjay Gandhi’s baby crocodile (do all headstrong leaders encounter crocodiles in their impressionable years?).

The family’s travel preferences, recounted by Jagat Mehta, illustrate their love for the outdoors. In 1958, father and daughter, aged 67 and 41, led a diplomatic mission to Bhutan via Tibet, trekking 105 km in five days from the Nathu La pass to Paro, at altitudes of around 15,000 feet. If contemporary leaders who attribute all the ills of India to the Nehru-Gandhis attempted such feats in their international travels, it would improve their figures, their temper and their world view.

"Germany needs tougher laws against cyber crime, top policeman tells paper","Representational Image Representational Image

Germany’s top police official has called for tougher laws to fight cyber crime on the illegal internet – the Darknet – and other organised criminal structures, in an interview published on Saturday. Holger Muench, president of the Federal Criminal Police Office, told Die Welt newspaper that German law needed to be adjusted to account for the massive harm such criminal activities can do.

“Professional hackers can cause enormous damage. They represent a danger for security and the economy,” Muench said. “That should be reflected in the sentences as well.” Muench said current law made it difficult to go after operators of botnet networks that enable large-scale automated cyber attacks. Muench’s comments came after a German court recently gave a suspended sentence to a British hacker-for-hire who confessed to a cyber attack that knocked out the internet for around a million Deutsche Telekom customers.

The regional court in Cologne handed the man, named only as Daniel K., a suspended sentence of a year and eight months for attempted commercial computer sabotage. The maximum sentence was up to 10 years, and prosecutors had asked for two years. The Federal Criminal Police Office last year reported 83,000 cases of cyber crime that caused damage costing over 51 million euros. More than half of German companies have been hit by spying, sabotage or data theft, the IT industry association Bitkom reported last month.

Die Welt newspaper also quoted the federal prosecutor for Frankfurt, home of Germany’s internet crime agency (ZIT) as calling for reforms of current law to account for a growing trade in drugs, pornography and weapons on the Darknet. “The criminal code for cyber crime must be reformed and modernised, otherwise many of the crimes that we see cannot be sufficiently prosecuted,” Georg Ungefuk told the newspaper.

Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, whose party wants him take over the federal interior ministry after the Sept. 24 German election, said Germany needed a more comprehensive approach to cybercrime, despite its decentralised federal structure that assigns great responsibility to the individual states. “The competencies between the federal government, states and military are even more blurred in the cyber realm than in the fight against terrorism,” he told the weekly magazine Der Spiegel. “We need new structures.”

Players have had a huge win: Allan Border after new pay deal,"Cricket Australia and ACA settled the dispute on Thursday. (Source: Reuters) Cricket Australia and ACA settled the dispute on Thursday. (Source: Reuters)

The cricketers of Australia had a huge win after settlign the play dispute with Cricket Australia, former captain of the Australian cricket team Allan Border has told the Guardian on Friday.

Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) ended the pay dispute after coming to an “in-principle agreement” which was signed on Thursday after a face-to-face discussion.

“The players have had a huge win,” Guardian quoted Border as saying. “This has been a total knock-out in the 15th round for the players. They should be very happy with the situation, particularly the girls,” he added.

After the new deal, Australia’s state and internationals are guaranteed to pocket a 30 percent of the revenue, which is expected to be approximately USD 1.67 billion, for the next five years. The female will get an increase of USD 47.7 million in their payment which earlier were USD 7.5 million and will now be USD 55.2 million.

The deal also give USD 30 million for grassroot cricket but Border raised serious concerns regarding that and questioned how it will help at that level?

“I can’t quite work out grassroots cricket [though], what’s going to change? They still go out there and do their chook raffles and fundraising events and nothing much has changed as far as I can tell,” said Border.

With the despite settled, Australia will see their Bangladesh go on as per schedule. It is scheduled to begin on August 22. The team will then travel to India for ODI and T20I series before the summer Ashes series against England.

The confirmation of Bangladesh tour has provided a relief to Bangladesh Cricket Board as Australia players had threatened to boycott the tour if the dispute did not get settled.

“It’s great news for Bangladesh. Definitely we are very happy to see the problem has resolved,” BCB boss Nizamuddin Chowdhury said. “Their next commitment is in Bangladesh. Now after the dispute is resolved, we can look forward to hosting them,” he added.

This woman denounced her million dollar inheritance to marry her love,"They met in 2008 while she was studying at Oxford. They met in 2008 while she was studying at Oxford.

Being born into luxuries is not a choice but people get used to it with time. Privileges like that of a private jet, houses in three continents, round-the-clock security guards and staff to be at your beck-and-call at every instance. One such heiress who was quite fortunate to grow up with these extravagances left everything for love. Yes, daughter of Malaysian tycoon Kay Peng, Angeline Francis Khoo gave up her inheritance and married her long time beau after her rich and famous father disapproved their union.

Peng, Chairman of Malayan United Industries, an investment firm has substantial stakes in renowned lifestyle brand Laura Ashley in the UK. Her father is one of Malaysia’s richest men and, according to Forbes, his net worth is a whopping $300 million.

She moved to England in 2001 for higher education and started spending hours in various departments of Laura Ashley as part of her work experience, it seemed her life was completely planned and she would eventually be part of the business. However, things changed when she fell in love with a man of humble origin. Khoo met Jedidiah Francis while she was doing her Master’s at Oxford in 2008. The Caribbean-born data scientist was then a junior dean at Pembroke College. When eventually, she told her father she wanted to marry Francis, he did not grant them his blessing.

“She knew if she decided to follow her heart she would end up losing any financial inheritance and any contact with her own family. But that did not deter her from marrying her love. “I believed Dad’s stance was wrong, so there was no question about what was right. I’ve been fortunate to have that perspective: you can have money and it’s a blessing; it allows you to do things and gives you options, but there are also things that come with it, such as control,” she told Daily Mail talking about her decision.

She further claimed ditching money and luxuries were actually easy as she never considered it. “Money amplifies negative characteristics and that can cause problems. To walk away from that was actually very easy. I didn’t even consider it.”

The couple tied a knot at a ceremony that had only 30 guests and no one from her side attended the wedding. “The wedding took place at the Pembroke College Chapel was conducted on a shoestring as she thinks they spent about £1,500. Once married, the newlyweds lived in Francis’ college lodgings and she had to take up several jobs in marketing.

But her struggles didn’t end there. Her parents had a long exhausting divorce after her mother, former Miss Malaysia filed a plea saying she was in an ‘abusive marriage’ and cited his “unreasonable behaviour” for the split. After spending bills of £6.1 millions on the case, the settlement was made in a UK court. She was the only child among her four other siblings who was called in the court to testify and that was quite traumatic.

However, after a four-years of a gruelling experience during her parent’s divorce to turn things and add some positivity and colour in her life, she started her own business. Now, a fashion designer, Khoo started ‘Rosie on Fire’ that makes colourful, flirty chiffon kimonos in modern prints. And it’s not just a venture with business in mind. The fashionable garment is made as much as possible “by low-income women in Malaysia who would otherwise have to move away from their children to find work,” the report added. “There is a responsibility that comes with privilege; you have to do things to help other people,” she said explaining the thought behind her business model.

"Sailing — a challenge, but worth the struggle","The ocean expedition went on from Mumbai to Kavaratti near Lakshadeep and returned to Madh Marve. (Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty) The ocean expedition went on from Mumbai to Kavaratti near Lakshadeep and returned to Madh Marve. (Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty)

Mumbai’s love for the sea has transcended centuries and generations. From being a small fishing community in ancient times to becoming a bustling trading hub that it is today, ‘Bombay’ has changed in many ways. Its dependence on the sea has stayed constant through these changes. After sailing clubs were established across the city during the colonial era, sailing became an incredibly popular sport in the city and has continued to grow.

In the last two decades, there have been significant changes to the Mumbai coastline and the sailing culture. There have also been many challenges such as poor infrastructure and legal hurdles that have prevented sailing from becoming more popular. There has been a surge in the number of boats in the harbour — from around 50 boats in 1994, to approximately 220 now. There was an initial boom in boat sales between 2004 and 2008, but the figures dropped after the 26/11 terror attacks and the global financial crisis.

The 26/11 attacks imposed many restrictions on sailing timings and the economic slowdown made matters reduced spending on luxury boats. Moreover, the depreciating rupee made it expensive to import boats, and the imposition of higher import duties on sailboats, speedboats and other pleasure crafts, from around 25 per cent to 45 per cent made things worse. “Boats got expensive and no one was willing to spend so much on just tariffs,” notes Aashim Mongia, owner of the West Coast Marine Yacht Services Private Limited. Until very recently, registering private and commercial boats was complicated and unclear. The rights of boat owners were not defined. Boats had to be registered with the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB). However, the MMB had not defined the rights, making it hard to possess one.

Says Shakeel Kudrolli, founder of Aquasail India, “There was no definition for sailboats and pleasure vessels, making it impossible to register and recognise these boats.” Boat storage and servicing has been another challenge to overcome. During monsoons, boats are not allowed to remain in the harbour and are instead stored in open fields in Mora, Belapur or Mandwa. All boats are covered in plastic sheets and these areas lack essential facilities like travel hooks. There has been some traction to address these issues, especially by a group called the Indian Marine Federation (IMF). The IMF was formed in 2006 and brought together different voices of the industry to act as a pressure group to recognise the rights of sailors and boat owners.

A major IMF success has been to simplify boat registration. Under this new law introduced in December 2016, different types of boats have been defined as pleasure crafts, private boats, commercial vessels and other categories. The legislation also transferred registering authority from the MMB to the Mercantile Marine Department (MMD), a central agency. This shift makes inter-state marine travel far easier because the authorities can get access to boat information on a centralised database.

Many believe the best way to overcome infrastructure, storage and servicing issues is to develop marinas along the Mumbai coastline. “A marina’s innumerable facilities, from fuelling to servicing, and easy access make them essential to developing a thriving industry,” says Kudrolli.

The IMF has been able to lobby the government to develop marinas, with the aim of securing and developing the coastline. Mongia says, “Waterfront development has become the government’s prerogative.” West Coast Marine, in conjunction with the MMB, has taken over the development of the Mandwa jetty. The jetty recently added restaurants and malls, prompting many to go across the harbour for meals and day trips. Data collected by the West Coast Marine shows the sailing season of 2016-2017 saw a rise in the arrivals at Mandwa jetty — by 29,000 people — since 2015-2016. He adds, “Since we took over the development of Mandwa, ferry services have tripled and local employment is up by over 100 people. Also, more people are chartering boats.” But the poor infrastructure has always existed, which fails to explain the rise in sailing.

Kudrolli thinks this trend is due to a change in the mindset. Mongia agrees, saying people are now buying boats and putting them out on charters. “During weekends, you cannot charter a sailboat now even if you want to,” he says.

Regattas have also made a comeback, with Bombay Merchants Cup (BMC) races happening almost every Saturday afternoon. Participating boats have risen by nearly 15 in recent years. “Sailing is becoming a lifestyle again,” says Kudrolli. Homi Motivala, owner of Sailing Stuff, thinks sailing could become even more popular with better infrastructure. “The facilities are not user friendly,” he says, adding, “A marina takes care of your complete berthing requirements as well. There is no need for on-land monsoon storage.”

The reason why so many pursue this activity is because of the thrill of being on the water. Sankalp Kapur, a long-time sailor, says, “I would jump through any hurdle to listen to the wind and water and speak to the nature. Being out in the open by yourself is an experience, and I would never give that up.” There are many who love the sport and with the changes being made, sailing might just become more accessible in the future.

Israeli PM Netanyahu downplays ex-aide’s decision to testify in graft cases,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet meeting at his office in Jerusalem, Israel, Sunday, Jan. 29, 2017. (Abir Sultan, Pool via AP/Files) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet meeting at his office in Jerusalem, Israel, Sunday, Jan. 29, 2017. (Abir Sultan, Pool via AP/Files)

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu played down his former aide’s decision to become a state witness against him in two graft cases. On Friday, Ari Harow, Netanyahu’s former chief of staff, agreed to provide testimonies against the Israeli Prime Minister in two separate long-running criminal investigations, Xinhua news agency reported.

In a post on his official Facebook page, the Israeli PM dismissed the move as “background noises.” He addressed the “citizens of Israel” and said he is “continuing working for the benefit of the country.”

According to reports in local media, Harow, 44, has already provided the police with information about the cases. The US-born Israeli was one of Netanyahu’s most trusted aides. He served as Netanyahu’s bureau chief in the prime minister’s office in 2008 and was appointed as his chief of staff in 2014. Harow left this position in 2015 amid allegations of conflict of interests.

A document the police filed with the court on Thursday shows the investigations involve “suspicion of the commission of felonies of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.”

Netanyahu, 67, is a suspect in two cases. One, dubbed by the police as “Case 2000,” involves secret talks he held with the owner of a large Israeli newspaper called Yediot Aharonot about reducing the competition in the news sector in return for more positive coverage. The other case, known as “Case 1000,” involves suspicions that Netanyahu and his wife Sara received expensive gifts from Israeli-US businessman and Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan.

Netanyahu had been investigated by the police at least four times. In March, Police Chief Roni Alsheikh estimated the police are close to completing the investigation, saying “we are in the final stages.” The procrastination of the law enforcement authorities sparked anger in the Israeli public, leading to weekly demonstrations near the home of Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit to demand charges against Netanyahu. Netanyahu is serving his fourth term as Prime Minister.

China appeals for new North Korea talks,"North Korea pulled out of the talks with China in 2009 to protest international condemnation of a long-range rocket launch. (Representational/Reuters/Files) North Korea pulled out of the talks with China in 2009 to protest international condemnation of a long-range rocket launch. (Representational/Reuters/Files)

China’s foreign minister called for all sides in the North Korean nuclear dispute to return to negotiations following a UN vote to impose new sanctions. In a statement Sunday, Wang Yi appealed to other governments to resume the six-nation talks that involve the North, the United States, Russia, Japan and South Korea, as well as Beijing. “The aim is to bring the peninsula nuclear issue back to the negotiating table and seek a solution through negotiations until the denuclearization of the peninsula and the stability of the peninsula are achieved,” Wang said.

North Korea pulled out of the talks in 2009 to protest international condemnation of a long-range rocket launch. Last month, it test-launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the US mainland. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said Washington wants eventually to talk to North Korea, but thinks discussions would not be productive if Pyongyang comes with the intention of maintaining its nuclear weapons.

Wang’s statement repeated Beijing’s proposal for a “double suspension,” or a halt to North Korean nuclear development and to joint US-South Korean military exercises. It said that was the most reasonable way to ease tensions and create conditions for new talks.

US Air Force signs contract for two presidential aircraft,"The Air Force, which has been looking for ways to lower the cost of new Air Force One planes, has agreed to buy two jumbo jets from Boeing that were ordered but never delivered to a now-defunct Russian airline. The Air Force says it awarded the contract yesterday.

Two people close to the matter confirmed earlier this week that the Air Force and Boeing were in talks about the two planes that were still in the company’s inventory. They spoke anonymously because the deal hadn’t been publicly announced.

President Donald Trump has complained about the high cost of new presidential planes. Boeing’s website lists the current price for a Boeing 747-8 as $ 386.8 million. Modifications to accommodate security, communications and other presidential requirements would increase the final price.

Research shows a big breakfast daily may help you stay slim,"“Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper.” (Source: File Photo) “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper.” (Source: File Photo)

Want to reduce that ever-burgeoning waistline? Make breakfast the largest meal of the day as it may help maintain your body mass index (BMI), researchers say. A study showed that people who ate more than three meals daily and made dinner their largest meal were at the risk of developing a higher BMI — associated with increased of risks of various diseases.

Eating breakfast and lunch, skipping supper, avoiding snacks, making breakfast the largest meal of the day and fasting overnight for up to 18 hours may be the practical weight-management strategy, said Hana Kahleova, from Loma Linda University (LLU) in California. The findings confirm the ancient nutritional maxim “eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper”, Kahleova added. For the study, published in the Journal of Nutrition, the team examined more than 50,000 participants.

Irrespective of meal pattern, there was, on average, an increase in weight gain year-by-year until participants reached the age of 60. After 60, most participants experienced a weight loss each year, said co-author Gary Fraser, Professor at LLU. “Before age 60, those eating calories earlier in the day had less weight gain,” Fraser said, adding that after age 60, the same behaviour tended to produce a larger rate of weight loss than average.

“Over decades, the total effect would be very important,” Fraser said.

"Happy birthday, Kajol: 10 times the VIP 2 actor impressed us with her style","In a country like India that looks up to celebs for fashion inspiration, Kajol has often being ridiculed for her sartorial choices. As per experts, the talented actor, more often than not, has stepped on the wrong side. Things started getting better for the actor when she started taking interest in the way she dresses up and began communicating her preference to her stylists. On her birthday, here's a collection of her best looks.



Kajol in this navy floral printed sari looks radiant. We like how she paired it beautifully with a matching full-sleeve Mandarin collar blouse – it added a royal touch to her outfit. We love how stylist Yukti Sodha curated this look with statement diamond earrings to add just the right amount of bling. Even hair and make-up expert Mallika Bhatt did a good job here with Kajol’s romantic up do. It was perfect with a side-parting and her make-up with heavily kohl-lined eyes and a bright lip shade complemented the look. Having said that, a berry lip shade or something in dark red would have taken it up a notch but this too isn’t bad. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

From the time that Kajol would be a sure shot member of the worst-dressed club, this actress has defnitely come a long long way, and now she's been dressing to kill. This midnight blue, full-length shimmery gown by Prabal Gurung does wonders for her curvy figure, the deep V at the neck showing off her decolletage gives that oomph! Kudos to the stylist who went for this sensuous look. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Kajol who was seen in a Pankaj and Nidhi outfit looked lovely with smokey eyes and an updo. We love the long top with waist high slits, but the pants could have done with a little more fitting around her calf muscles and ankles. Despite this, she managed to pull off this look.

Kajol is a regular at Durga Puja pandals. Last year, we spotted the actor in a yellow and pink checked sari from Anavila and we absolutely loved it as it spelled handloom perfection.

Of murders and unpredictable twists: Author Ravi Subramanian on thriller writing,"Ravi Subramanian is perhaps the only true practitioner of the art in the Indian “Crime, Thriller and Mystery” space. (Source: UpGrad/YouTube/Amazon) Ravi Subramanian is perhaps the only true practitioner of the art in the Indian “Crime, Thriller and Mystery” space. (Source: UpGrad/YouTube/Amazon)

A look at the top 10 highest-selling “Crime, Thriller and Mystery” writers on Amazon India introduces us to the likes of Agatha Christie, Dan Brown, Sidney Sheldon and James Patterson. The only two Indian writers in the list are Ashwin Sanghi and Ravi Subramanian. While a larger chunk of Sanghi’s works draws upon Indian mythology and targets readers who also read the likes of Amish Tripathi and Devdutt Patnaik, Ravi Subramanian is perhaps the only true practitioner of the art in the Indian “Crime, Thriller and Mystery” space.

A banker by profession, Subramanian has written popular thrillers about banking and bankers, including an award-winning trilogy — “The Incredible Banker”, “The Bankster” and “Bankerupt” — and is now back with a fast-paced novel, “In the Name of God” (Penguin/ Rs 299/ 405 Pages).

So what are the rules for a successful thriller?

“Have a murder in the first page of the book. It always hooks the reader. Ask a question at the end of the first chapter. Do not reveal too much in the mid-chapters but build on your characters to keep the interest of the reader intact, and end with a powerful twist,” was the author’s answer during an interview at the IANS office here.

“I can come and kill you but that is not enough. What if after stabbing you I begin to twist and turn the dagger inside your body? It is the final twist which makes a thriller — ‘Oh damn! What a book’.” Subramanian also believes that a thriller is an overall experience. A reader would not want to finish it in 20 days; he wants to read it now and would be happy to finish more chapters in a day.

“So we keep the chapters very short. The reason for that is most people read books before going to sleep and normally they tend to think that I will sleep after finishing a chapter; if you are able to end that chapter on a high note and raise the curiosity of the reader, he is going to turn the pages and see that the next chapter is only three-pages long. And so the pages turn by themselves; without realising it, the reader is almost through 200 pages,” he added.

Subramanian clearly practices what he preaches — there are a whopping 121 chapters in the 400 pages of his latest novel. On the process of writing, Subramanian said It is a matter of deciding the subject of the book; once he has decided on that, the intuitive writer takes over without a set plot in mind. The plot gradually builds up as more and more chapters keep coming. “In this book, for instance, even when I had finished 90 per cent of it, I had no idea who the villain was going to be,” Subramanian revealed. While this surely lends a layer of unpredictability to the plot of the novel, isn’t it a painful task for the writer?

“Of course it is, but it is an advantage nonetheless,” he opined. “It’s painful because you often have to go back and rewrite a lot of stuff as, when I ultimately decide the villain of the novel, I may have to change something somewhere earlier in the novel. The advantage is that if I do not know who the killer is, there is no way that the reader will have the slightest idea about it.”

His latest work is titled “In the Name of God” and previously too, in “If God Was a Banker” and “God is a Gamer”, he has used some sort of a reference to God in the title of his books. The author said that it does not have anything to do with the high that mythological writing is witnessing in contemporary Indian publishing because one look at the cover of the book and you are sure that it has nothing to do with mythology and similar stuff. All events of the latest book happen in the “house of God”, the Anantha Padmanabha Swamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, and it was because of this that he used the word “God” in the title.

“What usually happens in thrillers is that you have a good and a bad guy, everybody doubts the bad guy and ultimately the good one emerges as the villain. But if everybody is grey, how will you pick who the villain? When I, as the writer, reached the end of it, it was only a matter of deciding who was going to be the villain and then making some changes here and there to suit the needs of the plot,” he contended. “In the Name of God” is currently the number one bestseller on Amazon India’s “Crime, Thriller and Mystery” category and is expected to draw more readers in the days to come.

The author hoped that thrillers would develop more prominently in the years to come and regretted that many publishers and authors are driven by what he called “market compulsions” that prevent them from considering thriller novels.

Someone wise once said, “If you want to know a man, look at his friends!” We are all born with a family, but we choose our friends ourselves. They define us, and hold on to us during the toughest moments in life. Harry, Ron and Hermoine or Jai and Veeru… Cinema has often impersonated the unbreakable bond through legendary friendships onscreen. To celebrate the relationship, a special day known as “Friendship Day” is observed on the first Sunday of August every year in India. This time around, it falls on August 6.

The tradition first started in US in 1935, but it actually dates back to 1919. The day is celebrated on different dates in different countries. In several southern South American countries, particularly in Paraguay, the first World Friendship Day – International Friendship Day was first proposed in 1958 by the World Friendship Crusade. Later, on April 27, 2011, the General Assembly of the United Nations declared July 30 as the official International Friendship Day. In Oberlin, Ohio, Friendship Day is celebrated on April 8 each year.

To make the day noteworthy, friends tie wrist bands to express love for each other. Not just that, they also surprise each other by gifting flowers and greeting cards! But, if you’re not in the same city as your friends, don’t worry, you can still tell them what they mean to you.

Who is Justin Gatlin and why was he booed?,"Justin Gatlin celebrates after crossing the line to win the gold medal in the Men’s 100m final. (Source: AP) Justin Gatlin celebrates after crossing the line to win the gold medal in the Men’s 100m final. (Source: AP)

The 100m final race on Sunday at the World Championships was supposed to be all about the legendary Usain Bolt, who was pulling the curtain on a successful career in 100m. Justin Gatlin of America ruined a perfecct sports fairytale and fans have more than one reason to hate him.

Yes, Gatlin was booed by a crowd of around 56,000 as he crossed the finish line to win gold on Sunday. But it was not only in relation to party spoiler for Bolt. Gatlin has been in news for being a twice doping offender as his Wikipedia profile screams Justin “the Cheat” Gatlin.

The American was booed at almost every turn this week in London – during introductions or when his face showed up on the big screen. Gatlin has a doping past but his suspension ended in 2010. He is, however, still portrayed as the bad guy, even by the commentators.

When Bolt prevailed over Galtin two years ago at the Beijing World Championships, it was hailed as good prevailing over evil. However, even Bolt felt that it was not fair to jeer Gatlin after his win. “The first thing he did was congratulate me and say that I didn’t deserve the boos,” Gatlin revealed. “He is an inspiration.”

Bolt said, “He is a great competitor. You have to be at your best against him,” Bolt said. “I really appreciate competing against him and he is a good person.”

Gatlin finished runner-up to Bolt in Rio Olympics 2016.

Alex Hales falls short of equalling Chris Gayle’s record,"Alex Hales hit a fantastic 95 of 30 balls. (Source: AP) Alex Hales hit a fantastic 95 of 30 balls. (Source: AP)

Not often do you get to see some serious power-hitting as displayed by Alex Hales on Saturday. However, while playing for Nottinghamshire against Durham hit a blitzkrieg 95 from just 30 balls but fell agonizingly short of equalling Chris Gayle’s record of the fastest century. After hitting nine sixes Hales attempted to hit one more but was dismissed on 95.

“I knew there was a chance to go for the quickest T20 century of all-time and you don’t get those opportunities very often,” Hales said and added, “I love batting at Trent Bridge, for me it is utter paradise, the wickets are great and there are some short boundaries, so I knew there was a chance of doing it.”

While the record for the fastest century eluded Gayle, along with opening partner Riki Wessels he managed to set up a record opening stand. The duo eclipsed the 105-run record set by Kolkata’s Chris Lynn and Sunil Narine in the IPL and went one better as they posted 106.

“It’s a special feeling to play here and to get so many in the Power Play overs with Riki,” Hales said. “As a team, we’ve got real momentum at the moment and hopefully we can keep it going.”

In his innings of 95, Hales hit nine fours and nine maximums and also hit 28 runs in one over.

When Knowledge is Power,"Journalism through RTI: Information Investigation Impact (India) Journalism through RTI: Information Investigation Impact (India)

The Right to Information Act is a law through which citizens can demand information from the government for Rs 10 plus the cost of photocopying documents, if any. The government, Union and state, must appoint information officers to gather and send the material, and there is a fine for non-compliance.

This book tells us that many countries have laws similar to RTI, pioneered by Sweden in 1766. In our neighbourhood, Pakistan legislated it in 2002 under General Musharraf, and today Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka have laws similar to RTI.

India got the law in 2005 under Manmohan Singh. However, many states already had information laws because of citizen pressure, the most prominent being a campaign by the Mazdoor Kishan Shakti Sangathan, led by Aruna Roy. The Delhi government’s Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia were also RTI activists, serving communities and neighbourhoods in Delhi before becoming politicians.

Author Shyamlal Yadav, senior editor with The Indian Express, has been reporting stories using RTI for over a decade. We should believe him when he says that the current government under Narendra Modi shows “no sign that [it] wants to weaken the RTI Act.” However, he cautions that “there are several officials (there are around 2,500 public information officers in the central government) who have started taking RTI provisions casually after the change in regime.” Yadav knows this from first-hand experience, as he writes.

The citizen uses RTI to access information related to personal issues, like passport applications, ration cards, school admissions and so on. Journalists are using it increasingly for source material, particularly for investigative stories, though Yadav admits that India’s media still has not done enough on this count. He says that his paper’s correspondents are routinely trained in the use of RTI. One imagines that the training includes examining the forensic record. Acts of corruption, particularly at the high level, may not be immediately manifest and require the piecing together of material. The book’s second half provides examples of stories which use access to government records.

As may be expected, the quality of the information is not always good and government can choose to be opaque on subjects that it does not want illuminated. Researchers at Amnesty International India (where I work) sent out about 3,000 RTI queries to all the jails in India for information on undertrial prisoners. Much of the material that was returned was gibberish, and it appeared that either the officials did not understand the laws, or they were filling in RTI queries without looking at the record, or the record was poorly maintained.

A phenomenon which the government is sensitive to, is that of frivolous RTI filing. Yadav gives the example of an individual who requested information on statues and busts around the country and then asked if one of his could be installed. This is seen as a drain on resources, and the government often expresses this concern. However, Yadav says that a large number of RTI applications come from within the government itself, through its employees.

One of the interesting things thrown up by the book is the role of the individual activist. We are often told that it is difficult for individuals to make a difference in our part of the world. Yadav profiles the work of Subhash Agarwal, a name many editors will be familiar with because of his regular letter-writing. It was Agarwal’s persistence which got judges to declare assets in their name and the name of their spouses and dependents.

Among the stories that journalism through RTI excavated is one on phone-tapping. Yadav learned in 2012 that the Union government intercepts over 250 phone calls a day. This is not done through any court order, as is required by law in the United States, but the approval of the Union home secretary (who must be an absolute genius if he has the ability to read and approve 250 applications a day, and presumably reject some).

Other stories, such as the travel costs of ministers and so on, are also given as examples. The RTI law, particularly if successive governments are not concerned about blunting its edge, as we are told, is the sort of weapon that journalism has long needed. It relieves reporters of reliance on anonymous sources for information and it reduces the space for deniability.

RTI-based stories will illuminate things that are not currently in the news, because that cycle is rapid and stories and issues from yesterday’s panel discussions are seen as having become dated. However, for those who are not in that business, and this publication and a few others come to mind, it is a transformational tool. Its relatively recent appearance should tell us that those who seek journalism and information that is solid and factual can anticipate an improvement in coverage.

"Hardik skips Surat court in sedition case, court issues bailable warrant","This was the second time that the Surat court issued bailable warrant against Hardik. (File Photo) This was the second time that the Surat court issued bailable warrant against Hardik. (File Photo)

The Surat District Court on Saturday issued a bailable warrant against Patidar quota leader Hardik Patel after he skipped the court in connection with the hearing in a sedition case. The court was scheduled to frame charges against Hardik and two other co-accused — Vipul Desai and Chirag Desai — who were present in the court. The court has now fixed September 4 as the date for the next hearing in the case.

This was the second time that the Surat court issued bailable warrant against Hardik. Hardik’s lawyer told the court that the Patidar leader couldn’t turn up due to “unavoidable circumstances” in Ahmedabad. “Over 50,000 Patidar youths were expected to attend a meet… At the last moment, police denied permission. Keeping in mind that a large number of Patidar youths may reach the venue on Saturday, Hardik had to be present in Ahmedabad to control the situation, if something went wrong,” his lawyer Y B Wala said.

Hardik was arrested in connection with the sedition case and spent nine months in jail.

Lily Has Left the Kitchen: The last Parsi cook in Ahmedabad looks back at better days,"Soul food: The Parsi kitchen at the Zoroastrian Ladies Co-operative society in Ahmedabad. Soul food: The Parsi kitchen at the Zoroastrian Ladies Co-operative society in Ahmedabad.

The kitchen of the Zoroastrian Ladies Cooperative Society (ZLCS), in a busy lane in Khanpur in the walled city of Ahmedabad, is brimming with activity. In a corner of the impeccably clean kitchen is a woman on a roti-making marathon. As the vessels pile up, another woman ensures that they are washed immediately and dried in the sun.

The smell of mutton wafts through the air as a pot of dhansak simmers on the flame. As a woman is about to sprinkle garam masala on the mutton-dal stew, a gentle voice stops her. “Not yet. Let it get a bit softer,” says Lily Sahuna.

The 67-year-old is the only Parsi in the kitchen, and also the last to cook in it. “The younger generation of Parsis do not want to be a part of this society,” says Sahuna. It is a rare day that sees her here now, when she has to supervise large orders on the weekend. Five years ago, she was diagnosed with a heart ailment and then stopped coming in regularly to the ZLCS. In her absence, the kitchen is run by six non-Parsi women, who started off with smaller tasks in the kitchen, like chopping vegetables.

The only commercial and exclusive Parsi food joint in the city, ZLCS has many faithfuls in Ahmedabad. “I order the daar ni poori as often as twice a month. My children love the bhakra. We have been ordering for over six years now. I do not know where else I can get Parsi snacks and dessert other than ZLCS,” says Shradhavi Suchde Dalal, who owns a city-based art gallery.

The snacks they make — bhakra, methi para, dates ghari, daar ni pori, patrel and coconut macaroons — vanish as soon as they are made. The ZLCS gets around five-six tiffin orders a day — mostly from single Parsi men and old couples of the 16,000-strong community in the city. “We get a lot of orders from Mumbai for the snacks. But we find it difficult to cater to all the orders as there is no expert left in the kitchen. We have stopped making delicacies like the popalji (a sweet bhajiya) and sandhra (which is made of coconut milk and is similar to a malpua) because there is no one to make it,” says Dhun Anklesaria, who is the treasurer of ZLCS. This is the only co- operative society in Gujarat which serves Parsi delicacies.

Sahuna was 19 years old when she became a part of ZLCS, a common thing for Parsi women in the 1970s when they wanted to learn Parsi embroidery. Her father, a havildar, had died when she was 18 and she needed money and a job. She enrolled in a stitching course and stayed on to cook.

“In 1967, we started making food and snacks as not many people wanted to learn embroidery. I was first taught to make cakes and biscuits. Two of the best ladies from our group were sent to the Ratan Tata Industrial Institute in Mumbai to learn cooking. They trained the rest of us,” says the frail woman.

The Ratan Tata Industrial Institute, which ran from a building on Hughes Road in Mumbai, was considered the last word on Parsi cuisine, cakes and pastries.

“I would make over 35 tiffins in a day. Each would consist of two non-vegetarian items, rice, salad and either roti or poli. We would also make Parsi snacks and desserts, which became an instant hit. We started getting orders from all over Gujarat. I remember this kitchen full of women cooking, laughing and singing. We would often work for 12 hours straight,” recalls Sahuna, as she wipes a tear from the corner of her eye. Her special skills lay in making sandhra and daar ni poori. For her efforts, she was paid Rs 7,000 a month. She would often get a bonus on big orders. Sahuna is now grandmother to three children, and her housing and health needs continue to be taken care of by the Parsi Panchayat and the ZLCS.

The future of ZLCS, and its recipes, does not look too bright to Zarin Cambatta, 80, president of ZLCS. “We are an endangered species and, with our generation, all the Parsi recipes will go,” she says.

“We had plans to start a restaurant but there are no takers left. The younger generation does not show any interest. They will prefer being chefs in hotels but will not want to be a part of this food unit. It is an important part of our culture and it is heartbreaking to see it slowly collapse,” says Mehroo Cama, vice-president of the ZLCS.

Monaco hit three past Toulouse to start French League title defence with win,"Monaco scored through Jemerson, Radamel Falcao and Kamil Glik. (Source: Reuters) Monaco scored through Jemerson, Radamel Falcao and Kamil Glik. (Source: Reuters)

French champions Monaco opened their Ligue 1 title defence with a 3-2 comeback win at home against Toulouse on Friday, showing the same attacking flair that took them to the top of the league last season.

Although they looked shaky at the back, Leonardo Jardim’s team, who scored 107 goals last term, were too hot to handle for Toulouse as they prevailed with goals by Jemerson, Radamel Falcao and Kamil Glik.

Toulouse twice went ahead thanks to goals from Zinedine Machach and Andy Delort, before collapsing under pressure.

Last year’s runner-ups Paris St Germain open their campaign on Saturday against Amiens with record signing Neymar to be presented at the Parc des Princes after joining from Barcelona for a 222-million euro ($261 million) fee.

Monaco’s defence were caught snoozing in the sixth minute when they allowed Machach to volley past Danijel Subasic from just outside the box.

It did not take the hosts too long, though, to react and in the 28th minute, Jemerson equalised with a fine header from Joao Moutinho’s corner kick.

New signing Rony Lopes was the most dangerous Monaco player, although the Toulouse defence proved to be a tough nut to crack. Eight minutes into the second half the principality side fell behind again.

Fullback Djibril Sidibe lost the ball in his own half to Jimmy Durmaz, who set up Delort, the striker coolly slotting the ball home from just inside the box.

Monaco drew level when Falcao netted his 33rd goal in 50 league games with Monaco, heading home from Kylian Mbappe’s cross.

In the 70th, Glik sent another header past Alban Lafont, deflecting Moutinho’s free kick to put Monaco ahead for the first time.

Mbappe was replaced after suffering a minor leg injury by Allan Saint-Maximin 15 minutes from time.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and rex Tillerson agree to talk US-Russian ties: Moscow,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke and agreed to discuss bilateral ties in Manila at the weekend, the Russian ministry said. The countries’ top diplomats spoke on Thursday as US President Donald Trump warned that bilateral ties are at an all-time and “very dangerous” low.

Moscow said the Tillerson-Lavrov phone call took place on the US initiative. The two men agreed to discuss topics including “the state of bilateral relations between Russia and the US at a meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN regional forum on security from August 6 to 8 in Manila,” the Russian foreign ministry statement said.

Lavrov and Tillerson also talked about how the United Nations Security Council should respond to North Korea’s latest missile launch on July 28 and agreed to discuss this in more detail in Manila, Moscow said.

They “agreed to discuss in detail the prospects of mutual cooperation” on resolving the situation in Manila, Moscow added.

Usain Bolt beaten but through after scoreboard scare,"The Jamaican, seeing his fourth gold in the event before retiring next week after the sprint relay, had a better start than in the heats but it was made to look awful by the explosion of Coleman. (Source: Reuters) The Jamaican, seeing his fourth gold in the event before retiring next week after the sprint relay, had a better start than in the heats but it was made to look awful by the explosion of Coleman. (Source: Reuters)

Usain Bolt booked his place in the World Championships 100 metres final on Saturday but he was given a double scare by American Christian Coleman, who beat him in their semi, and the stadium scoreboard, which initially left him off the results.

The Jamaican, seeing his fourth gold in the event before retiring next week after the sprint relay, had a better start than in the heats but it was made to look awful by the explosion of Coleman.

The American, fastest man in the world this year with 9.92 seconds, poured on the pressure and crossed first in 9.97. Bolt had to work hard to close the gap.

He eased up only over the last few strides and though it was only a semi-final he will not be happy to have been beaten across the line in a 100m race for the first time in four years.

Bolt clocked 9.98 – the second-fastest time of the night – but initially Andrew Fisher of Bahrain was shown as second with Bolt not in the first six.

South Africa’s Akani Simbine, who has been in hot sub-10 form all season, made the semis only as a fast loser having finished fourth in his heat on Friday but he had a bullet start in the first of the three semis on Saturday and maintained his form to cross first in 10.05.

American Justin Gatlin, again roundly booed at the start because of his previous doping suspensions, was just behind in 10.09.

Yohan Blake, the 2011 champion, showed he remains a threat despite rarely running this season, as he won the second heat in 10.04.

New British champion Reece Prescod gave the 56,000 crowd something to cheer when he blasted the last 20 metres to snatch second and automatic qualification for his first major final which takes place later on Saturday.

Mumbai’s inflation perception high,"Mumbaikars’ perception of current inflation is the highest barring Guwahati residents, shows the August round of inflation expectations survey conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Mumbaikars’ perception of current inflation is the highest barring Guwahati residents, shows the August round of inflation expectations survey conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Mumbaikars’ perception of current inflation is the highest barring Guwahati residents, shows the August round of inflation expectations survey conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The August round surveyed 4,737 households in 18 cities across India.

According to the survey, Mumbai residents thought the inflation rate in June was 8.5 per cent, lower than just Guwahati’s 10.6 per cent. These are the median numbers for each city. Actual retail inflation in June was 1.54 per cent, the lowest since the current consumer price inflation index debuted in 2011-12, prompting the RBI to cut the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6 per cent in its monetary policy review Wednesday. Ranchi’s perceived inflation of 3.4 per cent was the closest to the actual.

Still, Mumbai citizens were a bit more optimistic when it came to three-month ahead and one-year ahead inflation expectations. They expect inflation to rise to 8.6 per cent by September-end, well ahead of the central bank’s April-September inflation forecast of 2-3.5 per cent. Guwahati’s three-month ahead expectations was the highest at 10.1 per cent.

Ranchi residents were the most optimistic at 4 per cent expectation followed by Bengaluru at 5.4 per cent. One-year expectations were the highest for Thiruvananthapuram citizens, who expect inflation to scale 12.3 per cent followed by Kolkata at 10.9 per cent. Mumbai residents project this at 9.5 per cent. The most optimistic were Ranchi residents at 5.5 per cent.

In its latest policy review, the RBI’s monetary policy committee reiterated its commitment to a medium-term inflation target of 4 per cent.

Yuki Bhambri’s dream run at ATP Citi Open comes to an end,"Yuki Bhambri suffered a disappointing loss against 15th seed Kevin Anderson Yuki Bhambri suffered a disappointing loss against 15th seed Kevin Anderson

India’s Yuki Bhambri suffered a disappointing loss against 15th seed Kevin Anderson at the ATP Citi Open and thereby brought an end to his impressive campaign. Bhambri went down fighting 4-6 6-4 3-6 against the South Africa in the quarterfinals.

After the match, Bhambri spoke to the PTI and said, “I had a good tournament but disappointed with the result today. I felt I had a shot after winning the second set but got broken early in the third set and it’s much harder to come back against a big server”.

“I have fought well all week and felt comfortable playing against the big guys which is a good step moving forward. Looking forward to the rest of the season and hope to stay healthy,” he added.

It may be recalled here that prior to this loss Bhambri had a stellar campaign and had recorded one of the biggest wins of his career when he defeated Gael Monfils 6-3, 4-6, 7-5. He took one hour and 51 minutes to register the win. Bhambri, who ranks at 200, had also beaten Guido Pella of Argentina 6-7 6-3 6-1.

Earlier, Bhambri had spoken about his performance at the Citi Open and said that it was a good test and he enjoyed competing with the best. “We fight and work to play these kinds of matches and compete against the best, so it’s a good opportunity,” and added, “He is the defending champion and a class player. I have nothing to lose,” said the 25-year-old Delhi lad.

Iran’s Ayatollah Khameini pledges to continue missile program defying international pressure,"Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks to the audience in Tehran, Iran May 17, 2017. (Source: Reuters) Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks to the audience in Tehran, Iran May 17, 2017. (Source: Reuters)

Iran’s supreme leader on Thursday slammed the new U.S. sanctions on Tehran signed by President Donald Trump the previous day, and vowed his country would continue its missile program despite international pressure. Washington will “use any excuse to make a fuss” against Iran, said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, speaking at a ceremony marking the formal endorsement of President Hassan Rouhani for his second term in office.

“You launch a satellite-carrying missile, they make noise,” he said, describing the Iranian launch as a “scientific and technical job that is routine and necessary.” “The response to the hostility is to become stronger,” Khamenei added and described the U.S. government as “the top aggressor and the most shameless “enemy of Iran. “Some have sharply applied hostility (against Iran), like those who today are in office in the U.S.,” Khamenei said, without mentioning Trump or the U.S. president’s signing of the legislation on Wednesday. Also Read: Iran reiterates: New US sanctions are breach of nuclear deal

The law also imposed new sanctions on Russia and North Korea. According to a letter sent to the U.N. Security Council and obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press, the United States and three Western allies called Iran’s recent launch of a satellite-carrying rocket “a threatening and provocative step” that is “inconsistent” with a U.N. resolution endorsing the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

Iran last week launched the country’s most advanced satellite-carrying rocket into space, marking the most significant step forward for the Islamic State’s young space program. Also Read: Iran parliament adopts motion to reciprocate US sanctions

In the letter to the Security Council, the U.S., France, Germany and the United Kingdom complained that the Simorgh space launch vehicle, if configured as a ballistic missile, would have the range and “payload capacity to carry a nuclear warhead.”

Iran maintains the 2015 nuclear deal that put caps on its uranium enrichment program – a possible pathway to nuclear weapons – and the Security Council resolution endorsing that deal do not ban the country from ballistic missile activity. Russia, one of the five world powers that brokered the nuclear deal, has agreed with Tehran. On Tuesday, Iran’s Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani announced that Tehran has officially complained to the U.N. Security Council over the latest U.S. sanctions. Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, said Iran should continue to stand powerful in the face of its enemies.

“International engagement should not lead to ignoring hostility of the enemies,” Khamenei said at the ceremony, broadcast live on state TV. He added that “despite all the sanctions and enmities, the Islamic Republic is stronger” than before.

Rouhani, who will be formally sworn into office on Saturday in parliament, said the nuclear deal has been a sign of “good faith” by Iran and that t brought the nation respite from most difficult U.N. sanctions.

“Transition from the most difficult sanctions was achieved through a combination of the power of diplomacy and deterrent defensive power,” said Rouhani. He said that in his second term in office, Iran will “insist on constructive engagement with the world more than before.”

Earlier Thursday, the state TV website quoted deputy foreign minister and senior nuclear negotiator Abbas Araghchi as saying that Iran will come up with a “smart” reaction to the last U.S. sanctions.

Araghchi reiterated Iran’s stance that the U.S. legislation signed by Trump amounts to a “hostile” breach of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal. Tehran has prepared measures that Iran would take against the U.S. action, he added without elaborating, except to say some of the measures will “improve” Iran’s armed forces. The U.S. legislation imposes mandatory penalties on people involved in Iran’s ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them. It would also apply terrorism sanctions to Iran’s prestigious Revolutionary Guard and enforce an arms embargo.

Julia Goerges made it through an all-German semi-final at the Citi Open on Saturday with a 5-7 6-4 7-5 win over Andrea Petkovic, setting up a title match against Ekaterina Makarova.

In a match that lasted 2 1/2 hours, fourth seed Goerges rallied from a set down, producing 10 aces and breaking Petkovic’s serve five times on the way to victory.

She will next meet seventh seed Makarova, who also had to come from a set behind to beat Oceane Dodin 3-6 6-3 6-4 and reach her first WTA singles title in over three years.

Makarova, who moved past Simona Halep when the top seed retired due to heat in their quarter-final, found her form in the second set where she broke Dodin in the fifth game to seize momentum. She finished with 31 winners.

“I started today a bit slower than I have to be, but in the second set I tried to step in a little bit more and to make her move, and it started working,” Makarova told reporters. “I’m so happy that finally, I finished it in my way.”

A Mumbai man studying in the University of Southern California was cleared of rape after footage from security cameras indicated that the alleged victim, a 19-year-old student, willingly led him to her dorm room from a nightclub.

Prosecutors accused Armaan Premjee of rape, claiming that the woman was too drunk to give him consent. “I’m very grateful for these tapes,” Premjee told CBS news. “She put her arms around my neck, she started kissing me.”

Premjee claimed the woman wanted to have sex with him. Security footage outside the Banditos club showed the woman leading him out and making a sexual gesture to her friend behind his back. Then, she was caught on video signing them into her dorm

“She knew what she was doing. She was able to stand on her own two feet. She led the way,” Premjee said.

The judge hearing the case said: “I believe there was consent. There is a very strong indication that the alleged victim in this case was the initiator.”

Premjee, however, could face expulsion as the University of Southern California is reportedly conducting its own investigation. According to CBS news, the district attorney’s office will not refile the rape charges.

Sri Lankan Navy commissions India-built AOPV,"Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena. (Source: PTI, File) Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena. (Source: PTI, File)

The Sri Lankan Navy has commissioned an India-built state-of-the-art Advanced Offshore Patrol Vessel (AOPV), the first-ever purchase from a foreign ship builder, to boost its search and rescue capabilities. Sri Lankan President and Armed Forces commander-in-chief Maithripala Sirisena commissioned the new patrol vessel “SLNS Sayurala” this week at a ceremony at the Eastern Container Terminal of the Port of Colombo. It is the largest vessel built by an Indian ship builder for a foreign navy to date.

The event was also attended by Flag Officer Commander in Chief Southern Naval Command-Indian Navy Vice Admiral A R Karve.

Built at the Goa Shipyard Ltd (GSL) in India, SLNS Sayurala is the first-ever brand new platform purchased from a foreign ship builder and tailored for the specific requirements of the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN), a navy statement said.

It is expected to conduct patrols, policing, surveillance, reconnaissance, search and rescue, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) and pollution control missions in Sri Lanka’s maritime zones, the statement said.

The 105.7 metre-long and 13.6 meter-wide vessel can also be used for external fire-fighting missions.

Sayurala features a range of modern facilities and advanced technological instrument and is capable of achieving the maximum speed of 26 knots and cruising speed of 12-14 knots. It has a displacement of 2,350 tonnes.

Equipped with a landing facility and hangar for an advanced light helicopter (ALH), the vessel can accommodate a total of 118 crew members.

The SLN signed the contract for two AOPVs on February 17, 2014 and officially initiated the construction of SLNS Sayurala in May the same year.

It took delivery of the first AOPV on July 22 and transported the vessel to Sri Lanka on July 28.

The second AOPV is currently under construction in India and is slated to join the SLN fleet by next year.

Fox News suspends TV host in probe of lewd text messages,"Fox News host Eric Bolling. (AP Photo/Richard Drew/Files) Fox News host Eric Bolling. (AP Photo/Richard Drew/Files)

A host on US cable network Fox News has been suspended during an investigation into allegations that he texted unsolicited lewd images to women co-workers, the company said. It was the latest sexual harassment case to rock Fox News, America’s most watched cable news channel and a favorite among US conservatives. “Eric Bolling has been suspended pending the results of an investigation, which is currently under way,” a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday.

The suspension followed a HuffPost report Friday that Bolling sent an image of male genitalia to two colleagues at Fox Business and one at Fox News. The report, citing multiple anonymous sources in and outside of Fox News and Fox Business, said the messages were sent several years ago, on separate occasions.

Bolling has worked at the network for seven years. His lawyer Michael Bowe said in a statement to HuffPost: “Mr Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made.”

Last year, Fox News’s powerful chairman Roger Ailes left the company following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. And in April, the network parted ways with its star anchor Bill O’Reilly following a flood of sexual harassment accusations that triggered a crash in advertising sales. Last month, Jamie Horowitz, who oversaw programing for Fox Sports, was abruptly fired in Los Angeles over allegations of misconduct.

All-powerful Venezuelan assembly opens amid protests,"Foreign ministers from several South American nations said they will gather Saturday in Brazil for an emergency meeting to decide whether to evict Venezuela from the Mercosur trade bloc for violating its democratic norms.

(Photo:AP)

Defying criticism from Washington to the Vatican, Venezuela’s ruling party on Friday installed a new super assembly that supporters promise will pacify the country and critics fear will be a tool for imposing dictatorship. The constitutional assembly’s first order of business was selecting its head _ former Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez, a loyal follower of President Nicolas Maduro.

The nomination was approved unanimously by the 545 delegates, who marched to the neo-classical legislative palace accompanied by hundreds of red-shirted government supporters carrying roses and giant portraits of the late Hugo Chavez, Maduro’s predecessor and mentor. Some shouted, “He’s returned!” as a jab at the opposition, which had ordered images of Chavez removed from an adjacent building when it won control of congress in 2015.

The assembly was scheduled to meet again Saturday, and Rodriguez pledged it would be taking action against Maduro’s political opponents. “Don’t think we’re going to wait weeks, months or years,” she said. “Tomorrow we start to act. The violent fascists, those who wage economic war on the people, those who wage psychological war, justice is coming for you.”

The installation of the all-powerful constitutional assembly is virtually certain to intensify a political crisis that has brought four months of protests that left at least 120 people dead and hundreds jailed. Maduro vows the assembly will strip opposition lawmakers of their constitutional immunity from prosecution, while members of congress say they will only be removed by force.

But the opposition is struggling to regain its footing in the face of the government’s strong-armed tactics and the re-emergence of old, internal divisions. Several opposition activists have been jailed in recent days, others are rumored to be seeking exile and one leader has broken ranks from the opposition alliance to say his party will field candidates in regional elections despite widespread mistrust in Venezuela’s electoral system.

In a sign of its apparent demoralized state only a few hundred demonstrators showed up for Friday’s protest against the constitutional assembly, one of the smallest turnouts in months. They were halted by security forces firing tear gas and rubber bullets.

“This is what the constitutional assembly will bring: more repression,” said opposition lawmaker Miguel Pizarro. However, Maduro accuses his opponents of using violence and argues that the constitutional assembly is the best way to restore peace. On Friday he heralded members of the security forces who’ve been on the front lines of the daily street battles, claiming that 580 of them had suffered serious injuries from brutal attacks by “terrorist” protesters.

“I feel deeply the wounds of each one of you,” Maduro said addressing a small group of injured national guardsmen scarred with burns, on crutches and wearing neck braces. “With your bodies as your shield, you have defended the right to peace.” Amid the rising tensions, an increasing number of foreign governments have sided with the opposition, refusing to recognize the constitutional assembly and further isolating Maduro’s government.

On Friday, the Vatican urged Maduro to suspend the new body, expressing “deep worry for the radicalization and worsening” of the turmoil in Venezuela. President Donald Trump and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, agreed that Maduro must restore the rights of the Venezuelan people in a phone call Friday to discuss several ongoing international crises, according to a readout of the conversation by the White House.

Foreign ministers from several South American nations said they will gather Saturday in Brazil for an emergency meeting to decide whether to evict Venezuela from the Mercosur trade bloc for violating its democratic norms. Venezuela was suspended from the group in December.

The opposition boycotted the July 30 election of the constitutional assembly, saying the rules were rigged to further entrench Maduro’s “dictatorship.” The results have come under mounting scrutiny after the international company that provided the electronic voting machines said that “without any doubt” the official turnout had been tampered with – a charge dismissed by Maduro and the National Electoral Council.

The US State Department said Thursday the assembly was illegitimate, reiterating a call by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for Maduro to leave office or face unspecified actions to “return the government processes back to the constitution.” The constitutional assembly is made up of an array of pro-government trade unionists, students and even representatives of Venezuelans with physical disabilities. But the agenda is expected to be set by bigger-name loyalists, including Maduro’s wife, son and several ministers who resigned their posts to join the body.

It will have sweeping powers to upend institutions and in theory could even remove Maduro, a fact held up by government supporters as proof that it’s not a partisan power grab. One of its first tasks, which may come as early as Saturday, could be the closure of the opposition-controlled congress and the removal of chief prosecutor, Luisa Ortega Diaz, a longtime supporter of Chavez who recently broke with Maduro.

Ortega Diaz filed a complaint Thursday seeking a court order to block installation of the new assembly. The request, filed to a lower court in an apparent attempt to circumvent the government-stacked Supreme Court, was dismissed Friday on procedural grounds.

She also ordered prosecutors to investigate the allegations of election tampering. Smartmatic CEO Antonio Mugica said Wednesday in London that results recorded by his company’s systems and those reported by the National Electoral Council show the official turnout count of 8 million was off by at least 1 million votes. An independent poll suggested that fewer than 4 million people voted.

Opposition lawmakers have pledged to remain in power no matter what action is taken by the constitutional assembly, raising the possibility of two governing bodies operating side by side, with neither recognizing the other.

"New Zealand’s Auditor-General questioned over handling a fraud case, resigns","Representational image Representational image

New Zealand’s Auditor-General has resigned amid questions over how he handled a fraud case while he was head of the nation’s transport agency. Martin Matthews on Thursday said the issues and speculation over the case had made it untenable for him to continue in his role.

His resignation came ahead of a report into how Matthews dealt with manager Joanne Harrison when he was her boss at the Ministry of Transport. Harrison was jailed in February for stealing about 725,000 New Zealand dollars ($563,000) of taxpayer money.

Matthews said in a statement he wished he’d discovered the fraud earlier and acted swiftly once he became aware of it. But an earlier report found that four staff whistleblowers had raised concerns about Harrison, who had then treated them poorly.

CCI looks to beef up manpower for investigative works,"Last month, the government informed the Lok Sabha that a total of 73 positions were vacant at the CCI and the DG office. (Representational) Last month, the government informed the Lok Sabha that a total of 73 positions were vacant at the CCI and the DG office. (Representational)

The Competition Commission plans to hire people for nearly two dozen vacancies at its investigative arm as the fair trade watchdog continues to grapple with staff crunch. Candidates will be hired on a deputation basis for seven joint director general and 13 deputy director general posts, according to a communication issued by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). These positions are at the DG office. The appointments will be initially for 3 years and could be extended up to 5 years.

The CCI carries out probes into cases where there is prima facie violation of competition norms, through the Director General (DG) office. Around 37 per cent of the total 197 sanctioned posts are lying vacant at the regulator, which keeps a tab on anti-competitive business practices across sectors. This translates into 73 vacancies.

According to the communication, the candidates should have experience in investigation under any economic law such as income tax, Customs and enforcement or “gathering of intelligence”. “Applicants must be employees of central or state governments, government companies or autonomous bodies or regulatory authorities or universities or academic or research or judicial institutions etc of central or state governments,” the communication said.

Last month, the government informed the Lok Sabha that a total of 73 positions were vacant at the CCI and the DG office. “CCI notifies the existing vacancies, normally, three or four times in a year, for filling them up as per the prescribed mode of recruitment. Recently, nine candidates have been selected for appointment on deputation to various posts in the office of DG,” Minister of State for Corporate Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal had said in a written reply on July 21.

Jab Harry Met Sejal director Imtiaz Ali: I did not intend it to be a masterpiece,"Imtiaz Ali directorial Jab Harry Met Sejal has been criticised for being mushy. Imtiaz Ali directorial Jab Harry Met Sejal has been criticised for being mushy.

Filmmaker Imtiaz Ali has brushed aside criticism that his “touch” was missing from Jab Harry Met Sejal, saying he never wanted praise for himself while making the movie. “I am sure that a lot of people do not think that Harry Met Sejal is an intellectual masterpiece, but I did not intend it to be one,” Imtiaz Ali, a respected auteur known for his work in Jab We Met, Rockstar and Highway, told reporters at the film promotion on Saturday night.

The Shah Rukh Khan-Anushka Sharma starrer romcom has drawn flak from reviewers who have called the flick mushy and churned out from the same oven having typical Shah Rukh Khan romance and bereft of any storyline. Imtiaz, whose movies have a central theme of relationships and their vagaries, said he has never belonged to the “intelligent club” and always aimed at making this film for the masses.

“Some said you really need to be intelligent to understand an Imtiaz Ali film. For me that was a blow. I feel that I have never been part of any intelligent club. I wanted to make a very simple film with all my heart,” Imtiaz said. “I have not made this film for praise. You know I would like to be the director who can make different kinds of films. This one is made to reach the maximum number of people. Not to just get praise for myself.”

“I have been a veteran at this. When Tamasha released, lot of people praised the film but the film was not reaching the audience,” Imtiaz added, answering a question about the reviews Jab Harry Met Sejal has got since its Friday release. Shah Rukh, who worked with Imtiaz for the first time, echoed his director, saying the magic of Jab Harry Met Sejal will take time to latch onto people. “I have not seen Imtiaz Ali’s previous work. I have always believed the film should go beyond the subject and create some magic. I also believe people come with preconceived notion that they have seen already,” the 51-year old actor said.

“I am speaking on his (Imtiaz Ali’s) behalf. I think sometimes the bigger feeling is to try something new. I have been in the business long enough to try a formula film and to try a film with no formula. Succeeded and failed at both. So, I understood that I can’t even try to recreate the magic. Take Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, for example. I have worked with Adi (director Aditya Chopra) again. Me and Anushka have (in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi). But there will never be another DDLJ,” Shah Rukh explained. “So every writer or director does not want to go back to the same magic because he/she does not know how it was created.”

“Some critics have talked about the magic being missing. I think he would not like to recreate that magic that he has done in the past. This one has a new magic. It’s a new trick. Maybe just the newness of it is going to take some time for people to understand the magic of the film. Working with Imtiaz was quite magical,” he added.

The two-hour-twentyfour-minute film revolves around the two characters and how Sejal (Anushka) bumps into tour-guide Harry (Shah Rukh) and together they set off visiting the exact same spots that she and her family visited — in the hope of finding her lost engagement ring.

Bofors case: Plea for early hearing filed in Supreme Court,"The Supreme Court (Files) The Supreme Court (Files)

An application has been moved in the Supreme Court seeking early hearing of the politically-sensitive Rs 64 crore Bofors pay-off case after a fresh media report suggesting a financial quid pro quo for the Rs 1,437 crore Howitzer gun deal in 1986. The plea by BJP leader and advocate Ajay Agrawal has also alleged apparent collusiveness by CBI with the accused persons in the Bofors scam, saying the agency did not challenge the Delhi High Court’s May 31, 2005 judgement quashing all charges against the Europe-based Hinduja brothers. He has challenged the judgement in the apex court which had on October 18, 2005 admitted his petition that was filed after the CBI failed to approach the top court with the appeal within the 90-day deadline after the High Court verdict.

In the application, the lawyer-turned-politician said he had filed the appeal in public interest because the CBI did not come forward and it was reported that the Law Ministry then had not given permission to the agency, despite the fact that the High Court order was illegal. To substantiate the allegation of collusiveness between the CBI and the accused persons, Agrawal in his application has narrated the sequence of events that led to the defreezing of the London bank account of Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi, alleged middleman in the deal, in 2006, for which the then Additional Solicitor General B Dutta had visited England. He said such a step was undertaken despite the fact that the then UPA government and the CBI were aware that his appeal has been admitted by the apex court.

Agrawal, who had contested the Rai Bareli Lok Sabha elections in 2014 against Congress President Sonia Gandhi, also claimed that the CBI did not bother to inform the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, which was seized of the Quattrocchi matter, to inform about its move to defreeze the accounts. He said that on August 3, he had written a letter to the CBI seeking re-investigation of the entire Bofors scam and the trail of alleged bribe money deposited in Quattrocchi’s London bank account and the subsequent developments after the defreezing of the account on January 16, 2006.

Fresh developments assume significance in the wake of a demand in Parliament by ruling BJP MPs for reopening of the probe into the Bofors kickback scandal after the media reports quoting Swedish chief investigator Sten Lindstrom’s suggested payment of alleged bribery at the top level.

After the developments in Parliament, Agrawal also wrote a letter to the Enforcement Directorate seeking investigation into the trail of the kickback money under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999 and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. In the July 28 letter to the ED, he claimed that the alleged crimes were committed continuously till 2006 when two London accounts held by Quattrochi, who has been accused as one of the middlemen in the deal, were de-freezed.

The BJP leader said the CBI should file an affidavit about the facts and course of investigation into the case, as during the brief hearing on December 1, 2016, the agency had told the apex court that the authorities had not permitted it to file an appeal against the May 31, 2005 verdict. He said he would try to convince the apex court through his petition that the “High Court had quashed the charges against the accused persons on technical grounds and the order was totally perverse which is liable to be set aside.”

Justice R S Sodhi, since retired, of the Delhi High Court had on May 31, 2005 quashed all charges against the Hinduja brothers — Srichand, Gopichand and Prakashchand — and the Bofors company and castigated the CBI for its handling of the case saying it had cost the exchequer about Rs 250 crore.

Before the 2005 verdict, another judge of the Delhi High Court, Justice J D Kapoor (since retired) on February 4, 2004, had exonerated late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in the case and directed framing of charge of forgery under Section 465 of the IPC against the Bofors company. The matter was last listed on February 28 this year when it was adjourned. The apex court had on October 18, 2005 allowed Agrawal to file an appeal against the high court verdict in the absence of any appeal by CBI. The December 1, 2016 hearing had taken place after a gap of almost six years since August 12, 2010. The Rs 1,437 crore deal between India and the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors for the supply of 400 155mm Howitzer guns for Indian Army was entered on March 24, 1986.

The Swedish Radio on April 16, 1987 had claimed that the company had paid bribes to top Indian politicians and defence personnel. The CBI on January 22, 1990 had registered the FIR for the alleged offence of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery under the IPC and other sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act against Martin Ardbo, the then President of AB Bofors, alleged middleman Win Chadda and Hinduja brothers.

It had alleged that certain public servants and private persons in India and abroad had entered into a criminal conspiracy between 1982 and 1987 in pursuance of which the offences of bribery, corruption, cheating and forgery were committed to the extent of Rs 64 crore in the contracts for the supply of Bofors guns.

The first charge sheet in the case was filed on October 22, 1999 against Chadda, Quattrocchi, then Defence Secretary S K Bhatnagar, Ardbo and the Bofors company. A supplementary charge sheet against Hinduja brothers was filed on October 9, 2000. A special CBI court in Delhi On March 4, 2011, had discharged Quattrocchi from the case saying the country cannot afford to spend hard-earned money on his extradition which has already cost Rs 250 crore. Quattrocchi, who had fled from here on July 29-30, 1993, has never appeared before any court in India to face prosecution. He passed away on July 13, 2013. The other accused persons who have died are Bhatnagar, Chadda and Ardbo.

Venezuela stands by election count despite fraud allegation,"Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro (L) speaks during a meeting with members of the Constituent Assembly in Caracas, Venezuela August 2, 2017.

Venezuela’s president rejected accusations on Wednesday that his government inflated turnout figures from its constituent assembly election, branding them part of an effort to stain what he called a clean and transparent vote. The company that provides the country’s voting machines said that the government’s claim that 8.1 million votes were cast in Sunday’s poll overestimated the tally by least 1 million.

President Nicolas Maduro also criticized the accuracy of a story reported by Reuters that only 3.7 million people had voted by 5:30 p.m. on Sunday, according to internal electoral council documents, compared with the total 8.1 million ballots counted by authorities.

The documents, which break the data down into Venezuela’s 14,515 polling centers, show that 3,720,465 people had voted by 5.30 p.m. Voting ended at 7 p.m. and election experts said doubling the vote in the last hour and a half would be unlikely.

“We stand by our story,” Reuters global communications chief Abbe Serphos said in an email. Maduro was defiant.

“This election cannot be stained by anyone, because it was a transparent vote, audited before, during and after the ballots were cast,” he told a televised gathering of supporters.

Electronic voting technology firm Smartmatic, which created the voting system that Venezuela has used since 2004, said the turnout figures had been tampered with.

“We know, without any doubt, that the turnout of the recent election for a National Constituent Assembly was manipulated,” said Smartmatic Chief Executive Antonio Mugica in a press briefing in London, without providing details of the company’s methodology.

“We estimate the difference between the actual participation and the one announced by authorities is at least 1 million votes,” he said.

The opposition, which boycotted the vote, has dismissed the official tally as fraudulent. A high turnout was seen as crucial for leftist Maduro to legitimize the election in the face of wide international criticism.

The assembly will have the power to dissolve the opposition-run congress and is expected to sack the country’s chief prosecutor, who has harshly criticized Maduro this year.

Maduro on Wednesday said the newly-minted superbody will also have the power to strip members of congress of their immunity from prosecution. On Tuesday security forces jailed two of Maduro’s leading critics in a fresh blow to the opposition.

Countries around the world have condemned the assembly as a bid to indefinitely extend Maduro’s rule. He is widely criticized for an economic crisis marked by triple-digit inflation and chronic shortages of food and medicine.

Oil workers march

Maduro says the assembly is necessary to give him the powers needed to bring peace to the country after more than four months of opposition protests punctuated by violent clashes between security forces and hooded demonstrators. More than 120 people have been killed since the unrest began in April.

Maduro said delegates of the 545-member assembly will have their first official session on Friday. The opposition called for a new round of protests on Thursday.

Congress has promised to continue holding sessions despite the election of the new assembly. Last month it also named alternate justices to the Supreme Court in defiance of the top court, which has heavily favored Maduro.

Authorities arrested three of those justices, and four others have taken refuge in the residence of the Chilean ambassador in Caracas.

The United States this week called Maduro a dictator, froze his U.S. assets, and barred Americans from doing business with him. Maduro, like his predecessor and mentor, the late Hugo Chavez, regularly laughs off criticism from Washington even though the United States is Venezuela’s top crude importer.

The European Union said it was mulling a “whole range of actions” on Venezuela. But Maduro continues to enjoy public backing from the Venezuela’s military, though soldiers are increasingly weary of the popular backlash against their role in quelling protests.

Oil workers, whom Maduro considers a bedrock of support, rallied in several energy producing regions of the country on Wednesday.

Chanting and carrying the red Socialist Party flag, they denounced sanctions on the leftist president.

“We are here to show our rejection of the intervention of the United States,” one demonstrator said during a televised rally, calling the sanctions “a political show with harmful economic consequences for the people of Venezuela.”

United Nations to vote on tougher North Korea sanctions,"Russia, which like China is a veto-wielding council member, had warned that it would not support sanctions that would worsen North Korea’s humanitarian crisis.

The UN Security Council will vote today on a US-drafted resolution toughening sanctions on North Korea, diplomats said, a proposed ban on certain exports that could deprive Pyongyang of USD 1 billion in annual revenue. After a month of negotiations, the United States reached a deal with China, North Korea’s main trading partner and ally, on the measures aimed at ratcheting up pressure on Pyongyang to halt its missile and nuclear tests.

The Security Council was scheduled to vote at 3 pm (local time) today on the new raft of sanctions, diplomats confirmed. The draft resolution calls for a ban on all exports of coal, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore, as well as fish and seafood by the cash-starved state, according to the text seen by AFP.

If implemented by all countries, the ban would strip Pyongyang of roughly a third of its export earnings estimated at USD 3 billion per year, according to a diplomat familiar with the negotiations.

The diplomat, who briefed reporters on the content of the draft, said he had “high confidence” that China and Russia would support the proposed sanctions. Backed by its European allies, Japan and South Korea, the United States has been leading the push at the United Nations for tougher sanctions in response to North Korea’s launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4.

A second test on July 28 further raised alarm about Pyongyang’s drive to develop a missile capable of hitting the US mainland. The draft text would also prevent North Korea from increasing the number of workers it sends abroad, prohibit all new joint ventures and ban new investment in the current joint companies. North Korea is blamed for a “massive diversion of its scarce resources” toward the development of “nuclear weapons and a number of expensive ballistic missile programs,” the draft resolution said.

The new raft of measures would be the seventh set of UN sanctions imposed on North Korea since it first carried out a nuclear test in 2006, but these have failed to compel Pyongyang to change its behavior. Two resolutions adopted last year however have introduced economic sanctions with more bite.

The United States has put heavy pressure on China, which accounts for 90 percent of trade with North Korea, to enforce the sanctions. The proposed resolution would add North Korea’s Foreign Trade Bank, the primary foreign exchange bank, to a UN sanctions blacklist, which provides for an assets freeze.

It would also tighten trade restrictions on technology to prevent North Korea from acquiring items that could be used for its military programs. Under the proposed measure, North Korean vessels caught violating UN resolutions would be banned from entering ports in all countries.

The draft resolution however does not provide for cuts to oil deliveries to North Korea — a move that would have dealt a serious blow to the economy.

Russia, which like China is a veto-wielding council member, had warned that it would not support sanctions that would worsen North Korea’s humanitarian crisis. The United States and its allies have argued that tougher sanctions are needed to force North Korea to come to the negotiating table to discuss a halt to its military programs.

China and Russia have meanwhile insisted that sanctions alone will not change Pyongyang’s behavior and that talks are needed to address the crisis.

As negotiations at the United Nations entered the final stretch, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared that Washington was not seeking regime change in North Korea and was willing to talk to Pyongyang.

"Dilip Kumar is steadily improving, will take more time to get discharged, says a statement from hospital","Dilip Kumar’s team took to his official Twitter account to give an update about him. Dilip Kumar’s team took to his official Twitter account to give an update about him.

Legendary actor Dilip Kumar, who is undergoing treatment for kidney-related problems, is constantly showing signs of improvement. The 96-year-old actor was admitted at the Lilavati hospital on Wednesday evening due to dehydration and urinary tract infection. However, now the officials from the hospital say that he is coming back to normal but it is hard to say when he can be discharged from the hospital.

“Dilip Kumar is stable, comfortable and steadily improving and all his parameters are also improving. He is slowly coming back to normal. Creatinine level has also been coming down. He is passing urine, he is not on the ventilator, he is not on dialysis either and he is doing well. Dilip Kumar is still in ICU because there we can monitor him in a much better way. It’s very difficult to say when he will be get discharged but it will take some more time,” a statement from the hospital read.

Today, the actor’s team took to Twitter and thanked Dilip Kumar’s fans for their constant prayers for the betterment of the actor. “Dilip Saab is doing much better now. Please remember him in your prayers. The excellent team of doctors and staff of Lilavati Hospital along with Saira Baaji are caring for Dilip Saab 24×7.”

In his new book, Neel Mukherjee keeps an unwavering focus on the inequities, inequalities and exploitation of human beings by human beings

Title: A State of Freedom

Author: Neel Mukherjee

Publisher: Penguin Random House

Pages: 278

Price: Rs 599

If Neel Mukherjee’s Booker-shortlisted The Lives of Others (2014) was a diachronic dissection of the Ghosh family, spanning lifetimes, in his latest offering, A State of Freedom, he uses his linguistic scalpel for a synchronic cutting open of India’s now and here. Less a novel than a set of five linked narratives, their lengths ranging from a brief eight pages to a novella-length 100, A State of Freedom is probably the most sustained reflection on class in post-Liberalisation India in contemporary fiction. Reminiscent of two monumental works of non-fiction, P Sainath’s path-breaking Everybody Loves a Good Drought, published over two decades ago, and Sudeep Chakravarti’s Red Sun: Travels in Naxalite Country, published in 2008, Mukherjee’s novel brings back to the discussion table issues that seem to have fallen out of favour with the chatterati and the intelligentsia these last few years.

From the opening narrative’s unnamed protagonist, the Kolkata-born and–bred “tourist in his own country”, whose two decades in “the academic communities of the East Coast of the USA [have] defanged him of the easy Indian ability to bark at people considered as servants”, to the second narrative’s first-person narrator, a London-based designer, also Kolkata-born, who too is appalled at the way in which supposedly educated people like his own parents treat domestic workers in India, to the “servants” themselves, who are the subjects of the three remaining narratives, Mukherjee keeps an unwavering focus on the inequities, inequalities and exploitation of human being by human being in every story.

Yet, as the protagonists of his stories seem to believe, and Mukherjee himself seems to at times, not all human beings are equal, or, more problematically, capable of being equal. In the second narrative, the first-person narrator parenthetically describes his own use of the term “domestic help” thus: “(My mother’s generation still called them servants. My politically correct tag [i.e. domestic help] had not a jot of correlation to their status: their position in the Indian social hierarchy or economy had never changed)”. But this ironic self-deprecatory statement is marred by the statement, a few lines earlier, of the creation of the state of Jharkhand “carved out… after decades of agitation and activism by tribal peoples and backward castes — they had that dreaded Indian distinction, the branding iron of an acronym: OBC, Other Backward Castes — for a separate state…” etc. One notes several things here. First, the bleeding-heart-liberal championing of the underdog (tribals and backward castes); second, the use of the adjective “Indian” (see all the quotes above — Indian ability, Indian social hierarchy, dreaded Indian distinction); and, finally, the egregious error about the expanded form of “OBC”, which stands for “Other Backward Classes” and not “Other Backward Castes”. Is this the narrator’s error or Mukherjee’s? And is the repeated use of the adjective “Indian” to indicate primitive, casteist, sexist, class-biased positions a reflection of the narrators’ views or Mukherjee’s own? Not an easy question to answer.

A central takeaway from this beautifully written novel is that if one is born in middle-class, relatively privileged, urban India (a member of the English-medium class) one can only imbibe democratic and human values, and develop the ability to look critically at oneself, if one lives in the West; remaining in India dooms one to continue one’s horrifically solipsistic middle-class existence, treating everyone who is one’s social inferior with contempt and brutality. Such, for example, are the people who are Milly’s employers — the domestic help/servant who moves from the underdeveloped Naxal-infested jungles of Jharkhand to the highrises of Bombay/Mumbai (where she works for the parents of the second story’s narrator, among others) — one of whom, in Kolkata, is described as having picked up and thrown a 10-year-old boy “down the hole through which the lift goes up and down”. Milly, central figure in the novella-length narrative, is told she “should be grateful for what you have — things are far worse out there” by the tribal Christian woman who had got her a job as a domestic worker.

Mukherjee’s novel strikes all the right guilt-ridden-anti-capitalist-liberal-pinko-lefty chords so beloved of the West’s educated classes: middle-class Indians (who are actually pretty near the top of the class hierarchy, and so, should be seen as rich) are brutal exploiters of innocent tribals; innocent tribals who convert to Christianity end up exploiting their own people; development has only added modern forms of misery and enslavement to India’s traditional heritage of discrimination and violence; the only way out of this seems to be death, whether willed or otherwise. No wonder it has won high praise from Western critics. But for this reviewer, the biases that Mukherjee seeks to lay bare with his cutting prose end up revealing some of his own — and these are not always very pretty.

A magnificently written, marvellously phrased book, with its heart in its right place, A State of Freedom might not be quite what its Western critics claim (“devastating portrait of the inhumanity of the rich to the poor”, and so on) but it is certainly worth the read, if only to discover what it stumbles in attempting as also what it succeeds in achieving.

Who is Oviya and why is she trending? Here is everything about the Bigg Boss Tamil contestant,"Oviya made her acting debut with Malayalam film Kangaroo in 2007. However, her ticket to fame was her first Tamil film Kalavani opposite Vimal. Before she entered the Bigg Boss Tamil house as a contestant, Oviya had some interesting projects in her filmography. Currently, she is the most popular contestant of the first season of the reality show hosted by Kamal Haasan. (Source: Photo by Facebook)

Her popularity among viewers rose to an unexpected level when they saw Oviya's attitude inside the house compared to other contestants such as Juliana and Gayathri. In fact, her fan group Oviya Army on Facebook has already amassed about 75,000 followers, and it has only been five weeks since the show began. (Source: Photo by Facebook)

Initially, Oviya was like any other contestant. However, as she asked for just a banana and some green tea repeatedly on the first day, she charmed viewers. (Source: Photo by Facebook)

Her equation with the other Bigg Boss contestant Aarav, which has become a point of contention among fans after the recent episode, is another reason why she piqued audience's interest. Now that Aarav ignores Oviya, she has begun to act out her frustration and many assume that this will be the reason for her fall in the show. (Source: Photo by Facebook)

Her curt reply to Snehan, ""Neenga Shut up Pannunga (You please shut up),"" has now become a catchy phrase, being used on t-shirts for fans to show their love. (Source: Photo by Facebook)"

(Source: AP) India scored 622/9 (D) in first innings against Sri Lanka in Colombo while scalped a couple of wickets before the end of day’s play. (Source: AP)

The Virat Kohli-led Indian side tightened grip on this second Test match of the three-match series against Sri Lanka when they ended the first innings at 622/9 (D) in Colombo. Hosts Sri Lanka had a dismal start to their first innings as they lost opener Upul Tharanga without opening the score while Karunaratne was sent back for 25. Both the wickets were scalped by Ashwin.

Earlier, in the day, India continued the proceedings from their overnight score of 344/3. Though they lost Ajinkya Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara in the first session but half-centuries from R Ashwin, Wriddhiman Saha and Ravindra Jadeja anchored the visitors to a mammoth total. For Sri Lanka it was Rangana Herath who bagged a four-wicket haul in the process. Here’s a look at what pundits and experts have to say about the day’s play.

From Neymar to James Rodriguez: Top 8 expensive players in football history,"With Barcelona striker Neymar making a €222 million switch to Paris Saint-Germain it is yet another moment of transfer records getting shattered. However, if we take a deeper look at the eight most expensive transfers it can be observed that clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, Man City and Chelsea have dominated the transfer market in the past few years. While Madrid features the most number of players, others are not far behind. It also shows that the big clubs in Europe are not shy from spending big money to secure bright talent.

Neymar (Barcelona to PSG, €222 million) Brazilian star Neymar is one step closer of creating history as he is no longer a Barcelona player after the Spanish giants accepted a payment of €222 million. Now, the 25-year old is set to sign for Paris St-Germain for a world record fee.

Paul Pogba (Juventus to Manchester United, €105 million) France midfielder Paul Pogba rejoined Manchester United from Serie A club Juventus on a five-year contract, with an option to extend for a further one year. The Old Trafford club splashed out a world record fee of 89 million pounds (€105 million).Pogba was United's fourth and the last signing in the 2016-17 season. Eric Bailly, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan were the other three players to join United that season.

Gareth Bale (Tottenham Hotspur to Real Madrid, €94 million) Real Madrid managed to convince Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur to sell Gareth Bale. Bale's signing, which was €100.8 million, surpassed Madrid's previous record of €94 million when they bought Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United in 2009. Bale had signed a six-year deal.

Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United to Real Madrid, €94 million) Cristiano Ronaldo's move to Real Madrid from Premier League club Manchester United was finalised after then manager Sir Alex Ferguson agreed to sell the Portuguese winger. He then joined the Spanish giants for a whopping amount of €94 million. Ronaldo had signed a six-year contract.

Gonzalo Higuain (Napoli to Juventus, €90 million) Juventus completed the signing of Gonzalo Higuain from Napoli after accepting his €90 million release clause in, making it the most expensive transfer in the history of italian football.Criticised for his move from Napoli to Juventus, Napoli signed a five-year deal.

Neymar (Santos to Barcelona, €86.2 million) Barcelona completed Neymar's move from Santos for €86.2 million. After clearing the medical tests, the Brazilian striker had signed a five-year deal.

Romelu Lukaku (Everton to Manchester United, €84.8 million) Premier League club Manchester United signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton ahead of the 2017-18 Premier League season. The Everton striker signed a five-year contract with the Old Trafford club. He joined the Red Devils for an amount of €84.8 million.

What the monks drink: Belgium’s dizzying array of beer,"Hitting the high notes in Belgium: Belgium offers a dizzying array of beer. (Source: Amrita Das) Hitting the high notes in Belgium: Belgium offers a dizzying array of beer. (Source: Amrita Das)

If you drink a Trappist, you do charity,” says Karel, my guide and a jazz musician, as we clink our beer glasses. Until now, Trappist beer and I were complete strangers. But this is the finest beer I have drunk in my life.

I am in Ghent, popularly tagged “Belgium’s best kept secret.” A Trappist is also the world’s best-kept beer. It comes with three rules. First, all production has to be inside the walls of an abbey; second, a monk has to be in charge of production; and third, all profits can only go to charity or channeled towards sustaining the abbey.

There are 11 Trappist beers in the world, of which six are in Belgium. The three in Flanders, northern Belgium, are Westmalle, Achel and the elusive Westvleteren. The French-speaking part of the country houses the others — Rochefort, Orval and Chimay.

After World War II, hesitant to spend on copper stills, Westvleteren turned to a brewery in Watou, West Flanders, for its production. This brewery was a Trappist abbey, now owned by a family close to the monks, and was called St Bernardus. From 1947 to 1990s, all the Westvleteren beers were produced by this brewery. But, in the early 1990s, when the quality labels were formed, they pulled back the official production inside the walls of the Westvleteren abbey. However, the brewery in Watou continued producing the beer under the name of St Bernardus — the commercial name of Westvleteren. In my glass, I am sampling the full flavour of St Bernardus Abt 12.

As Karel and I step out of the bar, ‘t Einde der Beschaving (The End of Civilisation) on Saint Veerleplein, I curiously ask if there were other alcohol variants to get enamoured by in Belgium, other than beer. He smirks at me and we walk a hundred metres across to ‘t Dreupelkot. This old, cosy bar is home to the classic Dutch gin called jenever. It houses more than 200 varieties of the drink. The bartender pulls out a bottle of Belegen Graanjenever and fills my shot glass. Traditionally, we take the first sip of the spirit without holding the glass — by bending to the table and placing our mouth directly to the glass. Dull golden and potent, this one resembles vodka infused with herbs and flowers.

The following day, I continue my quest for the ‘other’ Belgian liquors. After an elaborate walking trail in Ghent, I stop by Groot Vleeshuis, an aged meat house, also called the Great Butcher’s Hall, for a break. I see Ghent’s Ganda hams hang from the high roof. It dates back to the 15th century when it was used as an indoor, wholesale meat market.

I sit with an assorted platter of meat, cheese and savouries but there’s nothing to quench my thirst. Upon enquiring, I am served a glass of sparkling, clear Belgium produce — the refreshing golden drink called RoomeR. Commonly drank as an aperitif, RoomeR is prepared by infusing elderflower blossoms and originates in Belgium. It is served chilled and even though the beverage contains 15 per cent alcohol, I feel none of its effects.

I pedal from Bruges to Damme next, a small touristy village about seven kilometres from Bruges’ city centre. The sun adds to the picture perfect frames of the Belgium countryside. As Tom and I park our bikes outside De Uilenspiegel (The Owl Mirror) restaurant for lunch, I am already thinking of what drink to pair with my steak. Tom encourages me to try the locally brewed Maerlant Damse Tripel beer but warns me against its heaviness. The beer is a produce of Van Steenberge Brewery in Ertvelde, about 40 kilometres east of Damme and is available only in Damme.

Owing to its exclusivity, I give in. Indulging in a chilled glass of the beer, I understand that developing a stamina for it would have helped. Nonetheless, I did manage to ride 12 kilometres back to Bruges, without sleeping on the two-wheels.

In Antwerp I find myself in a tight spot. Tempted to indulge in Duvel beer, I cautiously pick the Dutch variation of Negroni from the bar menu of Horta Grand Cafe. I wonder if I made a mistake by choosing a popular cocktail over a local brew. But as I study the drink beside me, I feel like the bond was meant to be. The bright red colour of the gin cocktail is diluted by chunky ice cubes and the hint of orange peel adds a contrasting aroma. Giving it a gentle shake, I sip to know I have made the right decision.

On my last day in Antwerp, I chance upon a traditional pub in the Grote Markt (Great Market Square). Café Den Engel is an example of Antwerp’s bruine kroeg (brown pub). The guild house establishment is believed to date back to the 14th century. The crowd here are seniors, each sitting with a glass of beer in front of them. I ask the friendly bar hostess about the dark amber-coloured beer in most glasses and she points me towards the tap. No questions asked, I request for De Koninck from the tap. This beer has been locally brewed in Antwerp since 1833. It is fondly called bolleke De Koninck, where bolleke refers to the iconic shape of the glass it is served in. I grow infatuated with its sweet and very lightly spiced taste. As the drizzle eases outside, I pay €2.30 for my beer and walk out happily dizzy.

As I pack for my flight back from Brussels, I lay the diverse Belgian liquors on my bed. From RoomeR’s rounded bottle to a variety of St. Bernardus’ Trappist beers, I knew I couldn’t take better souvenirs back home.

"US may soon expand UN talks on North Korea sanctions, signaling China deal: diplomats","FILE PHOTO: A TV news program shows a file image of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, May 14, 2017. (SAP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) FILE PHOTO: A TV news program shows a file image of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, May 14, 2017. (SAP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)

The United States could shortly broaden talks on a push for stronger UN sanctions on North Korea to include all 15 Security Council members, signaling a likely deal with China on new measures, diplomats said on Thursday. Since North Korea’s July 4 launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the United States has been negotiating with Pyongyang ally China on a draft resolution to impose new sanctions on North Korea, which fired a second ICBM last Friday, in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions.

“We have been working very hard for some time and we certainly hope that this is going to be a consensus resolution,” China’s UN Ambassador Liu Jieyi told Reuters on Thursday. Some diplomats said the United States could give the draft resolution to all 15 council members as early as Thursday. Typically, the United States and China have agreed sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, China, Russia, France or Britain to be adopted.

The United States has been informally keeping Britain and France in the loop on the negotiations, while U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said China had been sharing the draft and negotiating with Russia.

US President Donald Trump’s administration has been frustrated that China has not done more to rein in North Korea and Washington has threatened to impose new sanctions on Chinese firms doing business with Pyongyang. But Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, on Friday that China would continue to fully and strictly implement Security Council resolutions on North Korea, the ministry said.

Haley said on Sunday the United States was “done talking about North Korea” and China must decide if it is willing to back imposing stronger UN sanctions. But she has also acknowledged that Russia’s engagement on the draft resolution would be the “true test.” Russia noted on Thursday that the permanent five (P5) veto powers had yet to formally discuss the draft. It was not immediately clear if poor relations between Russia and the United States, which imposed new unilateral sanctions on Russia on Wednesday, would hamper the negotiations.

“Even if there is an agreement between the US and China, it doesn’t mean there is an agreement between the P5 members,” said Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who met with Liu earlier on Thursday and discussed a possible resolution. “Maybe there is a bilateral agreement (between Beijing and Washington), but that’s not a universal one,” he said, adding that while he was aware of what might be in the resolution he had not seen “the draft as it stands now.”

The US mission to the United Nations declined to comment. Moscow has disagreed with assessments by Western powers that Pyongyang has launched two long-range missiles, saying they were mid-range. Diplomats say China and Russia only view a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions.

North Korea has been under UN sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the Security Council has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear weapons tests and two long-range missile launches.

1930s imperial propaganda: How star-studded western films justified British colonialism,"How cinema carried imperial propaganda about pre-independence India. Examining The Drum (1938), Gunga Din (1939) and The Rains Came (1939). How cinema carried imperial propaganda about pre-independence India. Examining The Drum (1938), Gunga Din (1939) and The Rains Came (1939).

A series of Hollywood and British films were made between 1929-39 with India as their central theme. Historical or current affairs accuracy was not their main concern. Racial stereotypes and stock characters of Indians as a generally ‘inferior’, silly and mutually divided people were all too common in their backdrop. A look into them suggest that back in time, we Indians may have had stronger reasons than vagrant thin-skinnedness to be mad at some of the movies.

Here are three films that performed splendidly at the box office in the US and Britain and had a well known star cast of the time. They all had a strong subtext of the Indian socio-political situation, and different, distorted interpretations of it. And they elicited the strongest reactions in India – – which even then had a devoted mass of cinema goers. Examine their plots below and understand why they would have riled up Indian audiences.

The Drum (1938)

The Drum had been one of the most successful British empire films in terms of box office collections in 1938. However, within a week of its release in Bombay in September 1938, it spurred a wide-scale agitation among Indians which resulted in a law and order problem in the city. It took the police a week long effort and the film’s removal from exhibition to bring the situation under control.

The story, featuring Sabu, Raymond Massey, Roger Livesey and Valerie Robson, openly claimed to be set in 1938 India. It showed its hero — a British official — Captain Carruthers (Livesey) offer a ‘treaty of peace and friendship’ to the Emperor of Tokot, a fictional Kingdom located in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) near the Afghan border, to make it into a British subsidiary in return of a generous subsidy. The ruler accepts it, stating “If England is our friend, we shall have peace” and his subjects are seen as happy and jubilant at the prospect of being rendered safe from the ‘enemies’. He is however murdered by his brother, Gul Khan (Massey), who usurps the throne. The rightful heir to the throne, Prince Azim (Sabu), escapes being killed narrowly with the help of Carruthers and his wife (Robson). Gul plots to kill the Carruthers and his men at the Muharram feast but Azim saves his British friends by beating the warning drum he has learnt from his Scottish drumboy friend. Gul is murdered and the throne is restored to the young, British loyalist Azim.

Ideology and politics:

The film was deemed severely objectionable in India for maligning the character of Pathans, portraying them as barbaric brutes through savage dialogues and for its unabashed propaganda of the British Frontier policy, which was in reality severely criticised in and outside India. Conversely, it is also showed that the ‘good’ Pathans like Azim and his father were friends of the British, when in fact the Pathans had been by and large vociferously anti-British.

In 1937, the British had been alarmed and confounded by the Hindu-Muslim unity of Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s Khudai Khidmatgar and the Congress in the NWFP. The ideology of The Drums was overtly degrading to the fabric of communal harmony. The movie also implied that British were the bulwark preventing a Muslim takeover of India. The way archvillain Gul Khan is depicted was highly reminiscent of a Muslim conqueror who voices that he intends to kill (non-Muslims) en masse and oversee the rise of mosques all over India. These were precisely the fears being stoked by communal Hindu organisations like Hindu Mahasabha and Sanatan Dharm Sabha, who had also been active in the NWFP.

Gunga Din (1939)

Gunga Din poster. Courtesy IMDB Gunga Din poster. Courtesy IMDB

At a time when British empire in India was facing serious challenges from the raging anti-colonial struggle, Gunga Din (intended to be pronounced “Ganga Deen”) “gave a clarion call of ‘All’s well’ … for the benefit of the white audience,” writes historian Prem Chowdhry, the author of Colonial India and the Making of Empire Cinema.

Starring Cary Grant, Victor McLagan and Douglas Fairbanks and directed by George Stevens, Gunga Din (1939) was based on a popular short poem by Rudyard Kipling with the same name, in which a low-caste bhishti (water carrier) loses his life in the course of fulfilling his duty while quenching the thirst of wounded soldiers of the British Indian army.

Gunga Din tells the adventure tale of three adventure-loving British sergeants — Ballantine, Cutter and MacChesney — in the British Indian army who are sent to investigate an outstation in North Western Frontier Province attacked by ‘thuggee’, an ancient murderous cult and worshippers of Kali. In process of the plot, the sergeants have violent confrontations with the thugs and eventually discover their hideout in a Kali temple.

While the three officers alone easily overpower and outwit the hordes of thugs on all occasions, towards the climax they are wounded and captured. The bhishti Gunga Din’s bravery in alerting the regiment at the cost of his life saves the officers’ lives and prevents the regiment of the British Indian army coming for their rescue from walking into a deadly ambush. The sergeants are rescued and the uprising is stamped out by the British India army. Gunga Din is recognised as a hero and suitably rewarded: he is posthumously made a corporal in the British Indian army.

Ideology and politics:

Gunga Din glorified the Raj at the expense of the Indians. Noting its effect, an Indian film journal hit out: “All the British characters are honest, jolly souls while all the ‘natives’ are scheming, treacherous, unscrupulous devils. All but one, the solitary exception is Gunga Din … He is always cringing before them … That is how all loyal ‘natives’ must behave in presence of their rulers.”

The late 1930s had been a period of consolidation of communal forces in India, clamoring for the ‘two nation’ idea. During the 1937 provincial elections, after passing of the 1935 Government of India Act, the Muslim League failed to win many seats in the NWFP despite it being a Muslim majority area, which mainly went to Congress under Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s leadership. Therefore, in those days, it had been actively propagating that the nationalists in the Congress, being Hindus, were hell bent on creating a ‘Ram Raj’ which no true Muslim could align with.

Gunga Din too in its plot associated Thuggee with Hindus (Muslims were selectively excluded) and the Hindus with the nationalists. In a reversal from The Drum, the film showed a horde of killing thuggees overrunning the Frontier region, which in reality was a Muslim majority region. Thus reinforcing the idea of the danger of Hindu domination, which was in line with the British propaganda to communalise the nationalist movement. The Thuggees’ proclamation to take over all of India was projected to be as much against the Muslims as against the British.

Moreover, the portrayal of the Thug master, inciting the masses “to kill!” quite literally, is unmistakably cast in the mould of Mahatma Gandhi. Through this thinly veiled gag, the film caricatured Gandhi (a Vaishnavite and follower of Bhakti), by showing him as a worshipper of Kali and a believer in the cult of murder and violence to pursue his furtive agenda.

Another fault line that the film exploited was caste divides. The British had long projected themselves as the protector of downtrodden untouchables of India from the high caste Hindus of Congress. The film turns Gunga Din, a bhishti within Kipling’s poem, into a ‘loyal humble servant of the empire’ — whose yearning desire is to be a soldier in service of the Queen.

Released in the USA in February 1939, Gunga Din was one of the most popular and highly rated adventure films which broke box office records in the USA and Britain. Needless to say, however, the ‘heroism’ and ‘loyalty’ of Gunga Din, which resulted in the death of thousands of Indians, was a bitter pill for the Indian audience to swallow, who would have seen him as little more than a traitor. Gunga Din was banned in Bengal (citing potential disturbance to intercommunal harmony) and in Bombay, followed by other provinces as soon as moves were made to release it.

The Rains Came (1939)

By May 1939, Gunga Din and The Drum were publically affirmed by the British officials in India as causing ‘disturbances to Indian opinion’. “The successive banning of these two films was the proverbial last straw for many studios in the USA, where similar projects were abandoned,” writes Chowdhry. Gears were shifted in tune with the contemporary situation, the adventure plots were abandoned and a new sophisticated film came about: It was a grand narrative of progress and development in India under British colonial domination and also a romance. It was released in India in 1940.

The Rains Came, starring Hollywood actors Myrna Loy, George Brent and Tyrone Power, projected a new image of the British Empire in relation to the colonised: as one of a development partnership led by the Indian monarchs moral patronage and paternalism. It portrays princely India as the ‘real India,’ slowly coming out of backwardness, poverty and stagnation with the moral and material support of the British.

Rains tells the tale of Major Rama Safti (played by Power, a major Hollywood star in the 30s), a young Western educated Indian doctor in the Indian kingdom of ‘Ranchipur’, who is also the chosen heir of the Maharaja and the Maharani. He is friends with the British people living in Ranchipur, which is clearly a subordinate of the Raj. A married and wealthy English woman named Edwina (Loy) falls in love with Safti but soon earthquake and flood destroy the city and plague falls upon its residents. The Maharaja dies from it. Under the Maharani’s leadership, Safti’s tireless medical service and Britain’s unrestrained help, Ranchipur slowly begins to cope with its woes. Edwina, as a medical volunteer dies of the plague, but leaves her money for the cause of rebuilding Ranchipur. The able Rama Safti is crowned Ranchipur’s new King, with the blessings of the British.

Ideology and politics:

Marking a departure from the previous films, Rains avoids crude racial stereotyping of Indians to a large extent. The calibre of the monarchs and educated Indians is shown in a favourable, modern light. Britain is, of course, ever present – – to protect them and to assist them in uplifting their people. Imperialism is reimagined and recast in a softer, nurturing light — abandoning its aggressive presence for a maternal avatar here. Instead of a exploitative and degrading role, the colonisers are shown as helpful, modernising agents to the Indian society. In reality, one knows that British indifference was responsible for the Bengal famine of 1943.

The British position in India at the end of 1930s had been made shaky by the ability shown by the Indians post 1935 in tackling democracy. As demands of Indian nationalists for Purna Swaraj were growing louder, The Rains Came “tried to assert that the ‘injection of democracy’ was not required and that the traditional Indian rulers were capable of governing their people well, that is, with the patronage of the British,” writes Chowdhry. As a film that tried to propose an alternative for India within the British empire in 1940, The Rains Came failed to impress Indians, who had long written off princes and rulers as indolent and conspirators with the British — and with good reason. The new India would not look back to its Princely past.

Cinema’s early development coincided with the high noon of the British empire and it quickly emerged as the most influential propaganda vehicle of imperialists. Empire films The Drum, Gunga Din and The Rains Came attempted to respond to the anti-colonial developments by denying them. At the same time, they were a testament to the fact that Britain could no longer ignore the rise and ambition of nationalism of Indians.

UN alarmed at killings in Burundi and threatens sanctions,"Burundi has been plagued by sporadic violence since April 2015 when President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term led to street protests.(Representational image) Burundi has been plagued by sporadic violence since April 2015 when President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term led to street protests.(Representational image)

The UN Security Council is expressing alarm at reports of torture and extra-judicial killings in Burundi, and the increasing number of people fleeing the East African nation, now totalling over 416,000. A presidential statement approved yesterday reiterates the council’s intention to pursue sanctions against people inside and outside the country “who threaten the peace and security of Burundi.”

The council said it remains “deeply concerned” at the political situation and the government’s failure to implement a resolution adopted last year calling for the deployment of 228 UN police and human rights monitors. The government has also refused to allow the African Union to send 5,000 peacekeepers.

Burundi has been plagued by sporadic violence since April 2015 when President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term led to street protests.

Villa with a view: A tryst with nature at Chikmagalur,"Window to the hills: Teak trees and coffee plants in the Baganeheddal coffee estate. (Source: Kalyani Prasher) Window to the hills: Teak trees and coffee plants in the Baganeheddal coffee estate. (Source: Kalyani Prasher)

The worst thing one could do is shake me awake before the sun has even made up its mind about rising. Naturally, this is exactly what my friend proceeded to do on the very first day of my holiday.

“Wake up! Just look outside!”

I didn’t want to look outside. I wanted to look inside, into the very nice dream I was having about relaxing.

I was in Chikmagalur for my birthday, with the sole agenda of chilling, and I was not going to be bullied into sightseeing while still in bed.

Very early into my career as a travel writer, Chikmagalur popped up as an attractive destination. All the photographs we saw sitting in Delhi were simply superb — coffee plantations, misty mountains, birds, peace, quiet — the whole deal. So, I’ve wanted to go to Chikmagalur for about ten years now. This year, using my birthday as a suitable excuse, I decided to — as a sportswear brand advises frequently — just do it.

As I hurtled towards my dream destination from Bangalore airport, I started to become suspicious that the photographs, because of which I was making this long journey, may have been thanks to the talent of the photographers. The drive from Bangalore to Chikmagalur is probably the most boring journey I’ve been on, the only saving grace being some excellent filter coffee along the way, in an open air café, for Rs 10 a cup. Life got interesting towards the end of the five-hour journey, when you could finally see the hills of the Mullayanagiri range, a part of the Western Ghats.

What the drive to Chikmagalur lacks, the short drive from town (a charming small town with lots of old buildings) to Primrose Villas, a beautiful small hotel set within the 125-year-old Baganeheddal coffee estate, makes up nicely. The 700-acre plantation is like a forest through which snakes a path, just wide enough for a single car, slowly taking you up to the hotel. As we wound our way up, we saw tiny white flowers covering the Arabica plants: a rare sight, the coffee bloom comes on the ninth day after it rains, so we happened to be at the right place at the right time.

Even better than driving through the forest is to view it from the lobby, or the villa, where glass has been used cleverly in its architecture to showcase the best feature of the hotel: its location. The glass walls everywhere offer soothing views of the lush green forests of coffee, and, the mountains beyond, with the highest peak at 6,500 ft, greeting you from every corner of the resort. However, I did not want to partake of this fantastic view at 6 am. So I awoke later, enjoyed a breakfast of mushroom-and-cheese omelette and cold coffee at the villa, and proceeded to dream about lunch. Food was definitely the highlight, after the views, at our villa. The service is another plus: you never hear any complaining voices or grumbles. You can eat what you want, as long as you inform them a day ahead, whenever you want it — wherever you like.

On the second day, we decided to visit the Bhadra Tiger Reserve, a two-hour drive away from the resort. The unprofessional people manning the reserve had to be woken up from their slumber during safari hours. They told us we could only do an hour’s safari because it was just the two of us. By far the worst safari experience in India, or the world, Bhadra is totally avoidable.

It was with some relief that I returned to our haven, Primrose Villas, and proceeded to drown my sorrows in strong spirit, with some peanut masala on the side. We decided to wake up early the next morning — at 6 am, for a plantation walk. I reluctantly agreed.

This is when I finally saw the view that my friend was trying to wake me up for. Through the day, the Western Ghats looked pretty from the villa, rising behind a cover of thick verdant green. But now, there was real drama unfolding. Mist covered the entire forest in front of me — it was a sea of white, hanging in the air like clouds. There was complete silence, save for birdsong and the sound of a mild breeze. I was in one of my favourite paintings of all times: I was in the German artist Caspar David Friedrich’s Wanderer above the Sea of Fog.

This was the best way to begin my new year. As we left for the plantation walk, we spotted many birds and the landscape was stunning. But that 6 a.m view from my villa, remained the highlight of the trip. Such beauty is best treasured just once. And, then, it’s forever in your memory.

Nissan Mississippi workers vote heavily against unionization,"The vote at the Canton plant could leave the UAW weakened ahead of contract negotiations with the Detroit Three automakers in 2019, when many analysts are predicting a cyclical slump for U.S. auto sales. (Representational) The vote at the Canton plant could leave the UAW weakened ahead of contract negotiations with the Detroit Three automakers in 2019, when many analysts are predicting a cyclical slump for U.S. auto sales. (Representational)

Workers at Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s plant in Canton, Mississippi, voted nearly two to one against union representation, the company and the United Auto Workers (UAW) said late on Friday. The vote at the end of a bitterly contested campaign extended a decades-long record of failure by the union to organize a major automaker’s plant in the U.S. South.

The vote at the Canton plant could leave the UAW weakened ahead of contract negotiations with the Detroit Three automakers in 2019, when many analysts are predicting a cyclical slump for U.S. auto sales. The last failed UAW vote in the U.S. South, at a Volkswagen AG plant in Chattanooga in 2014, was far closer than the tally in Mississippi.

Pro-union workers say the Nissan plant – which builds Nissan Murano sport utility vehicles, commercial vans, and Titan and Frontier pickup trucks – has a poor safety record and the automaker moved them to a 401(k) defined retirement plan from a traditional pension fund. The UAW had put 10 years of groundwork into the vote at the Japanese automaker’s Mississippi facility, after two unsuccessful attempts at a Nissan plant in Tennessee, only to fall well short in a bitterly contested campaign that the union maintained was a continuation of the civil rights struggle of the 1960s.

Nissan said the tally of votes, which was overseen by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), was 2,244 votes against unionization to 1,307 in favor. “With this vote, the voice of Nissan employees has been heard,” Nissan said in a statement. “They have rejected the UAW and chosen to self-represent, continuing the direct relationship they enjoy with the company.”

The UAW has maintained that Nissan has illegally threatened workers with the closure of their plant or the loss of their jobs if they voted in favor of unionization, a claim Nissan hotly denies. That claim has been backed by a number of complaints lodged by the NLRB. The union said in a statement it is asking the NLRB to proceed with a trial to “stop Nissan’s serial commission of unfair labor practices in Mississippi.”

The union claims in fresh charges filed with the NLRB that Nissan “conducted repeated captive audience meetings” and played “virtually non-stop anti-union videos” ahead of the vote. “The result of the election was a setback for these workers, the UAW and working Americans everywhere, but in no way should it be considered a defeat,” UAW president Dennis Williams said in a statement.

"Vijender Singh bloodied, bruised; decision keeps reputation intact","Vijender Singh beat Zulpilkar Maimaitiali by unanimous decision. Vijender Singh beat Zulpilkar Maimaitiali by unanimous decision.

Vijender Singh was staggering, his nose was bloodied, he could not connect with his punches, he was clearly tiring and was hoping to survive. By Round 10, there was only one boxer showing the intent to punch and find an opening that would earn a knock-out win. Vijender was

Vijender was laboured in his movement, he clinched China’s Zulipikaer Maimaitiali in a desperate attempt to keep the big blows at bay. Vijender had already fallen to his knees in Round 9 following a blow to the mid-rift. Vijender had complained it was a low blow but the referee didn’t buy it and from there on there was a genuine risk of his unbeaten run coming to an embarrassing end in front of a partisan crowd.

China’s Zulipikaer Maimaitiali will regret that he left it to the judges to call a fight, which provided a harsh reality check to Vijender’s progress as a professional boxer.

The scores from the three judges read, 96-93, 95-94, 95-94 in favour of Vijender but given the dominating display by Zulipikaer, especially in the closing rounds, the decision will raise eyebrows. Vijender remained undefeated at the NSCI Stadium in Mumbai, courtesy the unanimous decision of the judges, but those genuine boxing aficionados who witnessed the fight would have gone away with a bad taste in the mouth.

Vijender in his post-fight comments used the occasion to call for an end of the India-China border stand-off. “I want to give back this belt to Zulipikaer. I hope for peace in the border and the message is about peace. That is most important,” Vijender said.

Yet for most part of the night, Vijender never looked like he was challenging for Zulipikaer’s WBO Oriental Super Middleweight belt. “I didn’t expect the fight to be that good,” Vijender said after the match, nose patched up and a blackened left eye socket. “Aaj kaafi khoon baha.” Technically, Maimaitiali was rated a one dimensional fighter, capable of boxing in “only one gear.” Yet on the night Vijender played his third bout on home soil, he faced a 23-year-old who bided his time and was prepared to be patient. The aggressive Chinese pugilist was working hard on his defence, cautiously measuring up Vijender’s arm-length jab. He often lunged in for a swift hook hoping to breach Vijender’s defence.

All night Maimaitiali had aimed for Vijender’s midriff, and the tactic had worked effectively. The 2008 bronze medallist at the Beijing Olympics is by now a veteran of protecting his face. Yet there was no answer to the Chinese boxer’s punches to the stomach. Maimaitiali was dictating play although Vijender, to his credit did manage a few clever and sharp blows to the face. “He’s a tough kid with a strong chin,” says Vijender’s coach Lee Beard. “Vijender landed some clean punches in the first six rounds, but the kid didn’t give up.”

Points docked

In the sixth round, Maimaitiali’s focus on attacking Vijender’s mid-rift had him inadvertently land a low blow. “It wasn’t good, and it disturbed me,” says Vijender, who fell to the floor on that occasion.

The incident resulted in Maimaitiali being given a warning that effectively cost him three points, one from each judge. But from this point on the Chinese was clearly the superior boxer. His punches connected more often than earlier even as Vijender began to tire.

Bloodied and visibly tired, the Bhiwani lad was a shadow of himself. At the final bell, Maimaitiali was still dancing on his feet, hands raised in victory. Vijender instead staggered to his corner. He still managed to raise his arm in celebration, albeit after much prodding from his staff. Vijender now has two titles, including the WBO Oriental title Maimaitiali brought into the match. It was a decision that Maimaitiali sportingly accepted with a smile and a bow to the crowds. But his father, who has been his lifelong manager, was visibly upset with. The fight was a contrast to what was predicted. “Knockout in the early rounds, this is not the toughest opponent faced” is what Vijender and Beard had asserted before the match. The tone changed after the match.

“This was the toughest fight for Vijender,” concluded Neerav Tomar, Vijender’s promoter.

Akhil, Jitender begin pro innings with TKOs

Beijing Olympic quarter-finalist Akhil Kumar made a perfect start to his professional career with a technical knock-out of Australia’s Ty Gilchrist in the junior welterweight category. It was a night to remember for the ‘Class of 2008’ as another Beijing quarter-finalist Jitender Kumar also marked his debut with a technical knock-out of Thanet Likhitkamporn in the lightweight category.

"JNU admission 2017: Only 53 per cent of total seats on offer, says teachers’ association","JNU admission 2017: JNUTA released truncated data, allegedly of its first round of admissions for MPhil and PhD courses, which shows that only 53 per cent of its total seats have been offered for admission. JNU admission 2017: JNUTA released truncated data, allegedly of its first round of admissions for MPhil and PhD courses, which shows that only 53 per cent of its total seats have been offered for admission.

The Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) on Thursday released truncated data, allegedly of its first round of admissions for MPhil and PhD courses, which shows that only 53 per cent of its total seats have been offered for admission. Moreover, of these, only 17 seats have been offered to reserved category students.

The JNUTA has alleged that the disparity in intake (the number of seats available) and on offer (the number of seats offered for admission after entrance and interview of candidates) is because of arbitrary rules made by the administration which are not mentioned in the UGC gazette notification of 2016. The data suggests that of the 139 seats across schools — announced as intake in the prospectus — only 74 have been offered. The adoption of the notification had led to over 80 per cent cut in seats this year.

In a statement, the JNUTA said the current admissions were “all set to go down in JNU’s history as ones in which the Constitutional guarantees of reservation were not implemented, and where the whole effort of the JNU admission policy was to ensure no admissions”. Of the 17 seats offered for reserved categories, two are for SCs, two for STs and 13 for OBCs.

“The decision not to give any relaxations for social disadvantage in the 50% qualifying marks (at the entrance level) has proved to be disastrous for social justice. It is safe to conclude, given the final numbers, that hardly any SC, ST, OBC candidates made it to the viva. The ones that did, undoubtedly suffered further by the completely unwarranted decision to abandon the deprivation points system for research admissions,” JNUTA president Ayesha Kidwai said in the statement.

“In most cases, there were enough candidates called for the viva-voce, all of whom, it must be remembered would have got over 50% in the written examination. Yet, shockingly, only 53% of the seats specified in the intake have been offered,” she said. For example, the Centre for Russian Studies had an intake of nine, of which six appeared for the viva-voce, yet only three have been offered admission. Similarly, the Centre for German Studies had an intake of 11 and interviewed 11 students, yet only seven have been offered admission.

The situation is particularly bad in Science Schools. The School of Computer and Systems Sciences had an intake of 25 but has offered only three seats. Similarly the Special Centre for Molecular Medicine had an intake of 15 but only offered three seats.

JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar said he had no knowledge of passing marks being imposed at the viva level. Kumar added that “everything was being done according to the UGC gazette notification”. Rector Chintamani Mahapatra said admissions were not over and that a second list would be out soon.

Neymar latest chapter in long Brazilian tradition at Paris Saint Germain,"Neymar became the 31st Brazilian player in the club’s history to have signed the contract. (Source: Reuters) Neymar became the 31st Brazilian player in the club’s history to have signed the contract. (Source: Reuters)

One thing is certain in Neymar’s new life at Paris Saint-Germain: He will not feel homesick. The Brazil forward, bought by the Parisian club for a world record 222 million-euro ($262-million) price tag, will be welcomed by a strong contingent of Brazilian internationals already in the French team.

PSG has a longtime relationship with the South American country. Following in the footsteps of his friend and compatriot Dani Alves _ who also joined PSG this summer Neymar became the 31st Brazilian player in the club’s history when he finally signed a five-year contract until June 2022, putting the transfer saga to an end on Thursday.

PSG was founded in 1970, the year Brazil won its third World Cup title. PSG soon after tried to lure the best player in the world to the City of Lights, but Pele declined the offer.

The first Brazilian player to wear the club’s colors was Joel Camargo, a world champion who joined the club in 1971. A long list of technically gifted players, including the likes of Leonardo and Ronaldinho, has since graced the Parc des Princes ground.

PSG’s current squad features five Brazilian players, with Thiago Silva, Marquinhos and Lucas completing the quintet, and it feels appropriate that PSG’s new away yellow kit was chosen to pay tribute to the club’s link with Brazil.

“We’ve been chatting the entire month, sending text messages, calling each other,” Neymar said on Friday during his first press conference in Paris. “In the end I’ve spoken to everyone. And more than just being excellent footballers, they are all very good friends. I love the fact that we play together for Brazil and also here in Paris.”

No other club in France has recruited as many players from Brazil. “There is something special between PSG and Brazil,” Lucas said. “Some very important players have left their mark on the club’s history. Brazilian people love French people and Paris. All Brazilians dream of Paris.”

The relationship between the French league club and Brazil intensified during the 1990s when then owner, pay TV Canal Plus, recruited foreign stars.

During that golden era for French football clubs, a period that was marked by the strong rivalry between PSG and Marseille, the first big Brazilian signings were a pair of Benfica players, playmaker Valdo and defender Ricardo.

In a soccer coup, PSG recruited Rai in 1993 one year before Brazil won the 1994 World Cup in the United States. Rai was a fan favorite and remains a club icon after he helped to write some of the most memorable pages in PSG’s history in a team that won the 1996 European Cup Winners’ Cup, a league title, two French Cups as well as two league cups.

But the elegant No. 10’s popularity can’t be compared to the excitement fueled by Ronaldinho. Although the former Gremio player stayed only two seasons in Paris from 2001-03 and did not win a single title, Ronaldinho is still remembered as the “Little Prince” for his tremendous dribbling skills and acceleration.

It’s now Neymar’s challenge to become the King. List of Brazilian players at PSG since the club’s inception in 1970: Abel Braga, Adailton, Alex Costa, Alex Dias, Jose Aloisio, Andre Luiz, Dani Alves, Joel Camargo, Marcos Ceara, Cesar, Christian, David Luiz, Edmilson, Everton, Geraldao, Leonardo, Lucas, Marquinhos, Maxwell, Armando Monteiro, Nene, Neymar, Paulo Cesar, Rai, Reinaldo, Ricardo, Ronaldinho, Souza, Thiago Silva, Valdo, Vampeta.

"Stan Wawrinka to miss US Open, out of 2017 season","Stan Wawrinka suffered a first round loss at Wimbledon 2017. (Source: Reuters) Stan Wawrinka suffered a first round loss at Wimbledon 2017. (Source: Reuters)

In the post-Wimbledon period, tennis – at least the men’s side of things – has seen large scale injury concerns. And it has come to title contenders with Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic both sticking to the sidelines. And now it is the turn of Stan Wawrinka. Following Djokovic’s decision to sit out the remainder of the season, Wawrinka too has followed in his steps to miss the 2017 season which would rule him out of defending his US Open title. Wawrinka had won the US Open last year after beating Novak Djokovic in the final.

On Thursday, Wawrinka had announced that he was not going to play the ATP Masters 1000 events in Cincinnati and Montreal and has now added the remainder of the season to his list to get his knee operated upon.

“[U]nfortunately I have decided to skip Canada and Cincinnati to be on the safe side,” he said in a statement on Thursday while adding that the decision was made following “consultations with my doctors and my team.” “I need to be 100 percent confident before I resume competition,” Wawrinka said.

“I am sad to announce that, after talking with my team and doctor, I had to make a difficult decision to undergo a medical intervention on my knee. This was the only solution to make sure I will be able to compete at the top level for many more years. This is obviously extremely disappointing, but I’m already looking ahead and planning my recovery. I love this sport and I will work hard to get back to my top level and play many more years,” said Wawrinka in a statement through his management on Friday.

Last year’s US Open was Stan’s third Grand Slam following his title wins at Australian Open and French Open. Wawrinka has been replaced in the US Open draw by Florian Mayer.

Kevin Anderson downs Jack Sock to make Citi Open final,"Kevin Anderson reached the Citi Open final. (Source: Reuters) Kevin Anderson reached the Citi Open final. (Source: Reuters)

South Africa’s 45th-ranked Kevin Anderson, seeking his first crown in nearly two years, upset American Jack Sock 6-3 6-4 to reach the ATP and WTA Citi Open final.

The lanky 31-year-old from Johannesburg saved all three break points he faced in the second set with aces in advancing to Sunday’s championship match against the winner of a later showdown between Germany’s eighth-ranked Alexander Zverev and Japan’s ninth-ranked Kei Nishikori.

Anderson seeks his fourth and biggest career ATP title on the Washington hardcourts after Winston-Salem in 2015, Delray Beach in 2012 and Johannesburg in 2011.

“It would mean a lot,” Anderson said. “I’m really excited to be there. I think I can take a lot from this week. It’s a great start to the summer. It will be a terrific opportunity.”

Russian seventh seed Ekaterina Makarova outlasted French fifth seed Oceane Dodin 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to book a berth in Sunday’s women’s final against German fourth seed Julia Goerges or Germany’s Andrea Petkovic, the 2013 Washington runner-up.

The 58th-ranked left-hander seeks her first title since 2014 at Pattaya City. Makarova’s only other WTA crown came at Eastbourne in 2010.

Sock, a champion this year at Auckland and Delray Beach, had not dropped a set all week and had been broken only once, but Anderson changed that in short order.

Anderson broke Sock at love for a 2-0 lead and held serve from there to take the first set, saving a break point in the last game with a service winner.

Sock double faulted on the first break point of the second set to hand Anderson a 2-1 edge. Anderson saved two break points in the sixth game with an ace and denied Sock’s final break chance in the eighth game with the last of his 12 aces.

“Some of my best serves were on break points,” Anderson said. “I’d like to have brought out some of them earlier but I’ll take them.

“I play my best tennis when my back is against the wall. I’m trying to channel that into my tennis.”

Anderson, who ousted top seed Dominic Thiem in the third round, had not reached a final since his 2015 Winston-Salem title.

Sock ripped the stadium court he played upon all week, saying, “I don’t think I’ll be back at this tournament, probably, in the future. Probably the worst court of the year. Speed, bounces, everything. Pretty shocking. Probably the worst court on the tour.”

The world number 19 was also unhappy about an incorrect line call that forced a replayed point on a break chance. “It’s pretty frustrating,” Sock said.

Anderson, whose 62 aces this week lead the field, is 0-2 against Zverev and 1-4 against Nishikori. He fell to Zverev in the second round at Washington in 2015 and lost to Nishikori in 2010 qualifying.

Nishikori, the 2015 Washington champion, is on an 18-month ATP title drought since last raising a trophy at Memphis in February 2016, a run that includes six finals losses.

Zverev, a 20-year-old who reached a career ranking high this week, seeks his fourth title of the year after crowns at Rome, Munich and Montpellier.

Nishikori is playing his first event since a third-roundexit at Wimbledon. Zverev reached the fourth round there, his deepest run yet in a Grand Slam tournament. Nishikori seeks his 12th career ATP title while Zverev chases his fifth.

Mauritanians vote on constitution changes sought by President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz,"President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. (Source: Wikipedia Commons) President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. (Source: Wikipedia Commons)

Mauritanians began voting today on several contentious changes to their constitution sought by President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz but opposed by a wide swathe of opposition lawmakers and civil society groups. Aziz is pushing to abolish the country’s Senate and several other state bodies and to make a small alteration to the national flag, measures that have galvanised a boycott movement hoping to sap the vote’s credibility by forcing a low turnout.

Polling stations opened at 7:00 am and were due to close at 7:00 pm in the conservative west African nation, where violent clashes have broken out after the authorities banned several rallies planned by opponents of the changes. The president is due to vote between 8:00 am and 9:00 am, but few others were visible casting their ballots in several Nouakchott polling stations visited by an AFP journalist at opening.

While Aziz, his supporters and several opposition parties are seeking a “Yes” vote, one moderate opposition party is seeking a “No”, while the remaining parties have joined civil society groups to call for a total boycott for amendments they consider unconstitutional.

Jemil Ould Mansour, head of the Islamic Tewassoul party spearheading the movement against the vote, said the country’s leaders had fixed “the electoral roll and voting materials to prepare fraud on a massive scale,” and warned of violence. “Those in power are pushing people to violence by not allowing any kind of protest not in line with their own views,” Mansour told reporters on Friday.

The boycott movement draws broad political support from figures as diverse as religious conservatives and anti-slavery activists. They have held several protests attracting thousands of supporters, but have also been prevented from demonstrating by the security forces, who on Thursday shut down several planned rallies close to the capital with tear gas and baton rounds.

The UN Human Rights Office said Thursday that “protest leaders were reportedly beaten up and a number of them were arrested” during campaign rallies in the last few weeks, urging the government “take all necessary measures to ensure free, transparent and credible elections”.

Around 1.4 million Mauritanians are eligible to vote, and results are expected early next week. The proposal to modify the constitution, in force since 1991, was approved by lawmakers in the lower house but rejected by 33 out of 56 senators in March, leading Aziz to call the referendum to push through the changes. The most contentious measure remains the abolition of the Senate and its replacement with elected regional councils, and Senators have held a sit-in this week and demanded apologies from Aziz for accusing them of corruption.

Neymar’s record-shattering transfer shouldn’t bother other clubs,"Neymar was presented with the number 10 jersey at PSG – following his 222 million Euro transfer. (Source: AP) Neymar was presented with the number 10 jersey at PSG – following his 222 million Euro transfer. (Source: AP)

The first time I read about the transfer rumour linking Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain, I laughed it off. It felt like another crazy and ludicrous suggestion which would never come true. Like your “Cristiano Ronaldo is upset at Real Madrid and wants a Manchester United return” narrative or a “Lionel Messi wanted by Chelsea and PSG” by some outlets for three straight summer transfer windows. But as it picked up, from reliable sources close to the respective clubs, the earlier seemingly laughable proposition started to become seriously like in the last two weeks. There was the ambiguous Instagram post by Neymar suggesting he was hard at thought over the move, then came Gerard Pique’s “se queda” (he stays announcement) and one thought maybe it will die down with the pre-season gathering pace. But after some lull, this past week has been full of activity from both sides and media has had plenty of role to play in keeping the fire going.

The question remained, though, what would he go for? Surely with his talent, marketability and already built up status, he was going to shatter the previous most expensive signing record created by Paul Pogba when he moved to Manchester United from Juventus for 105 million Euros. If reports are anything to go by, Barcelona made it clear that they won’t be negotiating for a fee but asked for PSG to cough up his release clause – a cool €222 million.

As it reached Thursday evening, PSG had, remarkably, got the deal done in just over a day. Talk about circumventing the protests by La Liga authorities and getting the job done – for world’s most expensive football deal – in such quick time and for that the officials inside Parc des Princes deserve to be applauded (keeping the FFP debate aside for now).

Let’s rewind the story a bit and look at the most expensive transfer deal from a different perspective. When Real Madrid shelled out €94 million for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009, there was both shock and awe when he stepped up to the pitch at the Bernabeu with thousands in attendance. And three years later, the Spanish club loosened their purse strings even further to bring Gareth Bale from Tottenham by making him the first three-digit-transfer in Euro terms. But then it became an easier prospect to fathom with Pogba’s €105 million switch. Bale’s transfer almost made Pogba’s transfer in 2016 ‘understandable’.

Neymar addressed the media on Friday at Parc des Princes. (Source: Reuters) Neymar addressed the media on Friday at Parc des Princes. (Source: Reuters)

And now there is Neymar with his €222 million deal – an astronomical 122% rise in the previous transfer record. In fact, it is the biggest jump since 1903 when Ben Green moved from Barnsley to Small Heath for £500, beating the previous record of £100.

Now let’s address the biggest question – one with most far-reaching effects – what does it mean for the transfer window? Well, nothing. Neymar to PSG for €222 million is possibly a once in a lifetime thing or a major mistake by the French club. If you were to consider the valuation in some other terms, Neymar’s transfer is equivalent to Pogba-plus-Bale and you’re still left with money!

But unlike transfers for other big players at other big clubs, not all players would be acquired for their payout clause. It is a rarity and should be treated as such. You won’t expect an Alexis Sanchez deal – were it to happen – to take place for such big sums and it is understood for all involved. Let’s drop down further to middle-level clubs such as Levante in Spain or Southampton in England, the Neymar transfer won’t force them to spend more on signing a midfielder in the future. Yes the clubs spend more now than they did in the past but that is basic economics – if you have the money, more windfall, you will end up using it. One can safely assume that this Neymar deal is an unusual circumstance, a one-in-a-decade (perhaps) situation and the amounts of transfer business won’t be seriously affected by it.

GST on textile: Job works cut; e-way bill provisions finalised,"Union Finance minister Arun Jaitley. (Source-PTI Photo) Union Finance minister Arun Jaitley. (Source-PTI Photo)

The GST rates on textile job works like stitching and embroidery, and tractor parts were today cut while e-way bill provisions relating to online pre-registration of goods before transportation were relaxed. The all-powerful GST Council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising representatives of all states, decided to tax all job works in the textile sector, from embroidery to weaving, at 5 per cent instead of previously decided 18 per cent.

This 5 per cent rate will be applicable for job works in apparel, shawls and carpets.

To make farm equipment cheaper, tractor parts would attract the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate of 18 per cent instead of 28 per cent previously.

Government work contracts would attract 12 per cent GST with input tax credit, Jaitley said.

The Council also gave in-principle approval to anti-profiteering measures and setting up of a Screening Committee in 15 days to see if tax reductions after implementation of GST have been passed on to consumers.

Briefing reporters after the 20th meeting of the Council, Jaitley said all goods worth over Rs 50,000 will have to be pre-registered online before they are moved for sale beyond 10 km.

GST-exempted goods have been kept out of the purview of e-way bill– a minor relaxation from draft rules which required for all goods to be pre-registered under the e-way bill provision.

The e-way bill mechanism is likely to come into force by October 1.

The permits thus issued would be valid for one day for movement of goods for 100 km and in same proportion for following days.

As per the draft provision, GSTN would generate e-way bills that will be valid for 1-20 days, depending on distance to be travelled — one day for 100 km, 3 days (100 to less than 300 km), 5 days (300-less than 500 km) and 10 days (500-less than 1,000 km).

He said more than 71 lakh central and state taxpayers have migrated to the GST system and have completed registration. Another 15.67 lakh new applications for registration have been received.

He appealed to businesses to pass on the benefit of the reduced tax under the GST to consumers, failing which the anti-profiteering mechanism will be triggered.

The Council will meet next on September 9 in Hyderabad during which it will take up the issue of many rice millers deregistering their brands to escape taxation under the GST.

As per the GST rates, unbranded food items are exempted, where as branded and packed food items attract 5 per cent rate.

Jaitley said that the GST Council has given in-principle approval to pan India e-way bill. “There will be no check post. The process will be technology-driven and human intervention would be minimised. It will be reviewed going forward,” he said.

With regard to anti-profiteering provision, Jaitley said many businesses are not passing the benefit of tax rate reduction under GST.

“The market mechanism should compel that they give benefit of input credit,” he said, hoping that there would be “minimal” use of anti profiteering provision and the provision should itself act as a deterrent.

Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said that states will set up their respective screening committee within 15 days and the Centre will also set up the Standing Committee in same time frame.

These committees would be the first point for receiving profiteering complaints.

The Council in its meeting today also decided to exempt goods and services related to Junior FIFA World Cup which will be hosted by India.

Besides, aggregators who are offering small housekeeping services like plumbing or others will have to pay GST under Reverse Charge Mechanism. Besides, Cab service providers will have to pay 12 per cent GST if they claim input credit, and without input credit it would be 5 per cent.

Commenting on the decision, Pratik Jain, Partner and Leader Indirect Tax, PwC said exemption from e-way bill for exempted products or transportation within 10 km provides some relief to the industry.

“However, for real benefit of GST to be realised, it is important that supply chain bottlenecks are reduced. It is debatable as to whether e-way bill is required at all or transport documents including copy of the invoice should suffice,” he said.

Also, reduction of rate on job work relating to textile sector is a good news for the industry and would reduce the invested duty structure in the sector.

Finance Minister also talked about the issue of registered trademark on food products where 5 per cent tax is being avoided. “Hopefully, this issue will be sorted out in the next meeting,” he said.

On the appeal made to industry to pass on the benefit of input credt, he said it is good to see that the Government has taken a more consultative approach on anti-profiteering measures and for avoiding price increase.

However, industry would expect a clear guideline as how the profit on account of GST needs to be computed, he said.

Vishal Raheja, Senior Consultant, Taxmann said currently, taxpayers are facing difficult in absence of centralised way bill as every State has made its own rules but after e-way bill rules are notified, there will be common procedure all-over India.

“The major relief is that dealers engaged in supply of only exempted goods are not required pre-registration for movement of their goods,” he said.

Athletes upgraded at World Championships after doping cases,"USA 4x400m relay team with the gold medal in London. (Source: Reuters) USA 4x400m relay team with the gold medal in London. (Source: Reuters)

Four years later, Natasha Hastings and her teammates got the gold medal. What they’ll never get back is the night they came in second. Before the start of world championships on Friday, the U.S. 4×400-meter relay runners were awarded the first-place prizes they missed out on in 2013 after losing to a Russian team that was later stripped of the gold because of doping.

Hastings, Jessica Beard, Ashley Spencer and Francena McCorory were invited to the top step of the podium, had the medals placed around their necks and heard their national anthem play – all part of the IAAF’s attempt to set things right after getting so much wrong over the years in its less-than-upstanding fight against doping. Britain and France also moved up one spot in the race.

Hastings, who will compete for the U.S. at this year’s world championships as well, said “awkward and bittersweet are definitely words to describe it.”

Much as she appreciated the gesture, and will treasure the gold medal, she echoed the sentiment of so many who have been in her shoes when she conceded she’d never totally forget the moment her team crossed the line less than 0.3 seconds behind the Russians.

“It’s a moment you can never completely get back,” she said. “Having a moment to get on the podium and hear the national anthem, yeah, kinda, sorta. … But there’s nothing like crossing that line in first place.”

McCorory also was awarded a bronze medal in the 400 meters after finishing fourth at the 2011 world championships in Daegu, South Korea. She didn’t think the emotions would overtake her Friday. They did.

“It was pretty emotional,” McCorory said. “I’m grateful the IAAF did let us relive the moment for sure, instead of handing the medals to us and saying, `Congratulations.”’

McCorory, who’s not competing this week, will give her medals to her grandmother, who wears them to work. She said this is a step in the right direction, even if she feels her moment was stolen.

“It’s kind of devastating to know that you can work as hard as you possibly could work and still get cheated,” McCorory said.

In all, 16 medals will be reallocated over the weekend in 11 events spanning from 2007 through 2013. Jessica Ennis of Britain, Kara Goucher of the United States and Stephenie Ann McPherson of Jamaica are among those getting new awards.

A number of these cases involved doping in Russia, which has been banned from the worlds by the IAAF. Nineteen Russians have been approved to compete this week as neutral athletes.

“It’s not a Russia thing, but it is a thing that sometimes you get out there and you wonder, `Do I have a fair shot at this? If I’m doing the right thing, is everyone else doing the right thing?”’ Hastings said. “I have to tell you that it is something that’s discouraging when you get on the track, and no matter how far in the back of our minds we try to push it, we talk about that.”

Eilidh Doyle and her British teammates were bumped up from bronze to silver from the 4×400 relay in 2013. It was nice to be honored in front of a home crowd, even if it was years later.

“For our medal, we were a bit luckier than the other girls because … we had the moment on the podium. Some of the other girls (honored by the IAAF) didn’t,” Doyle said. “They didn’t get the chance to go on the podium. It’s not very nice in that sense. At least this is happening now. These things are getting sorted out.

“But to look back and know it should’ve (had) a silver, you’re a little bit angry and annoyed because it’s not fair. You have to let it go and see the positive that things are getting changed.”

Doyle said she’s keeping her old medal since it’s engraved. “It will go into a memory box and be a reminder of, `Yes, that was my first medal and it meant the world to me when we won it. And yeah, it should’ve been a silver,”’ she said.

Doping charge against Jamaica’s Riker Hylton thrown out,"JADCO claimed the 28-year-old, part of the team that came third at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, had failed or evaded to submit a sample requested by a collection officer in April 2016. JADCO claimed the 28-year-old, part of the team that came third at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, had failed or evaded to submit a sample requested by a collection officer in April 2016.

Jamaica’s 4x400m world championship bronze medalist Riker Hylton has been cleared of an alleged doping violation by an independent anti-doping panel in Kingston.

The Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission(JADCO) claimed the 28-year-old, part of the team that came third at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, had failed or evaded to submit a sample requested by a collection officer in April 2016.

After a three-day hearing, the three-member panel ruled that JADCO had “not discharged its burden proving that Riker Hylton committed a doping violation under article 2.3 of the JADCO rules, 2015 to the comfortable satisfaction of the panel.”

Hylton’s representative Emir Crowne said he and his client were “grateful for the ruling”. “As you can imagine these proceedings weighed quite heavily on the athlete and he’s relieved to have this matter put to rest, especially as the eyes of the world will be on Jamaica and Jamaican athletes for the current IAAF World Championships,” he said. “At the end of the day the panel was not comfortably satisfied that Mr Hylton was in fact notified (by JADCO),” he added.

This is the second high-profile ruling to go against JADCO in recent times. In June, Commonwealth 400m hurdles champion Kaliese Spencer was also cleared by the Independent Anti-doping

Disciplinary Panel of charges she had refused to provide a sample for testing. That panel ruled it was “not persuaded by the standard of evidence provided” by JADCO, which had accused her of committing the offence in April 2016, the same time as Hylton.

BCCI seeks government clearance for hosting U-19 Asia Cup,"Earlier this year, as it turns out, the BCCI had written to the Indian government asking whether they could play Pakistan in a bilateral series next year. Earlier this year, as it turns out, the BCCI had written to the Indian government asking whether they could play Pakistan in a bilateral series next year.

THE BOARD of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has sought clearance from the Indian government to host the Under-19 Youth Asia Cup since the tournament will include a team from Pakistan. The tournament, as it stands, is scheduled to be held in November. It’s learnt that the BCCI had written to the Home Ministry a few weeks ago and are still awaiting a reply. As a result they have asked the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), who will be meeting in Sri Lanka during the second week of August, whether they could push the tournament back to allow the Indian board some more time to get the necessary permission. The tournament had been hosted by Sri Lanka last year and the BCCI were keen on bringing it to India this year.

“The BCCI has written to the Indian government seeking permission for whether we can host the Youth Asia Cup for under-19 boys. In normal circumstances, we wouldn’t be too worried about getting the clearance but since the tournament would include a team from Pakistan an approval is being sought. The government’s stance so far has been that India cannot play Pakistan in a bilateral series but there’s no clarity on whether they could face each other in a multinational event like this,” a BCCI official told The Indian Express.

Earlier this year, as it turns out, the BCCI had written to the Indian government asking whether they could play Pakistan in a bilateral series next year. Their request was, however, turned down and the BCCI had to then go ahead and organize a full-series with Sri Lanka at home in November-December of this year. BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary, meanwhile, was unavailable for comment.

Kenya faces last day of campaigning before presidential vote,"Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta laughs at a song that was played over the loudspeakers, at an election rally in Uhuru Park in Nairobi, Kenya Friday, Aug. 4, 2017.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)

Kenya’s presidential candidates dove into a final day of campaigning Saturday before Tuesday’s narrowly contested election as many worried that the vote could turn violent. The main opposition coalition said an American and a Canadian who were assisting with its campaign had been deported. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who planned to campaign Saturday in his stronghold of Nakuru city, again faces longtime opposition leader Raila Odinga, whose supporters gathered for a final rally in Nairobi, the capital.

Kenyatta is the son of Kenya’s first president; Odinga is the son of the country’s first vice president and has run in vain for the top post in three previous contests. Recent elections in the East African high-tech and commercial hub have been hotly contested, and more than 1,000 people were killed in post-election violence a decade ago. Kenyatta prevailed over Odinga in a 2013 vote that was mostly peaceful but tainted by opposition allegations of vote-rigging.

Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is among the thousands of expected election observers this time around. Some in the nation of 44 million people have been leaving the capital because of the threat of chaos, while many are simply going home to vote.

The torture and killing in recent days of a key election official in charge of the electronic voting system has some concerned about the possibility of vote tampering. On Saturday, Kenya’s main opposition party said an American and a Canadian who were assisting its campaign were deported after being taken from their homes on Friday. It was not immediately clear why they had been detained.

The U.S. Embassy in Kenya said on Twitter that they were “safe and departing” the country. The embassy said U.S. and Canadian officials have been in touch with their detained citizens as well as the Kenyan government.

A police official earlier said immigration officials were holding the American and the Canadian at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi. The official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak with the media. The detentions occurred at around the same time that armed and masked police raided an opposition vote counting center, intimidating workers and seizing equipment, said James Orengo, a senior member of the opposition National Super Alliance.

Kenyan police on Saturday denied allegations that officers broke into political party offices on Friday, saying no report of a burglary has been made to any police station.

US will not recognise Venezuela’s constituent assembly: State Dept,"Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro (L) speaks during a meeting with members of the Constituent Assembly in Caracas, Venezuela August 2, 2017.

The United States will not recognize Venezuela’s new national constituent assembly, the State Department said on Thursday, calling it “the illegitimate product of a flawed process.” Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has defended the newly minted superbody, created as a result of a Sunday vote and which countries around the world have criticized as a bid to indefinitely extend his rule.

“The United States considers the Venezuelan National Constituent Assembly the illegitimate product of a flawed process designed by the Maduro dictatorship to further its assault on democracy,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement, citing problems from the way the election was decreed to the design of the balloting.

“The United States will not recognize the National Constituent Assembly,” he said.

Maduro is widely criticized for an economic crisis marked by triple-digit inflation and chronic shortages of food and medicine. Venezuela’s opposition, which boycotted the vote, has dismissed the official tally as fraudulent. The company that provides the country’s voting machines said the government’s claim that 8.1 million votes were cast in the poll overestimated the tally by least 1 million.

Maduro on Wednesday rejected accusations that his government inflated turnout figures, branding them part of an effort to stain what he called a clean and transparent vote.

South African Tourism eyes one lakh Indian visitors despite post-GST apprehensions,"South Africa offers more than 60,000 different and customised tourism packages to the visitors.

Notwithstanding its apprehensions about the footfall of Indian tourists after the implementation of GST on July 1, South African Tourism is eyeing one lakh visitors from India in 2017-18, an official said on Tuesday. Despite a steady surge of 21.7 percent in the number of Indian leisure visitors in the African nation during the last calendar year the apprehension comes from the decline they witnessed in the numbers of Indian tourists for a few months since demonetisation in November.

“The reason why we are a bit apprehensive about the post GST scenario is because we did not think that we are going to get effected by the demonetisation. We were between 28-35 percent up month on month until October last year. But after demonetisation, we were not just down by two to three percent for a few months but we also lost our momentum of growth,” Hanneli Slabber, Country Manager India of South African Tourism, told reporters during the seventh edition of its travel trade training session.

“So now we are a little bit reluctant to say that the number of Indian visitors to South Africa would not be affected by the GST. We are hopeful that it would go in our favour,” she said adding that India held the eighth position in South Africa’s international source market last year with more than 95,000 visitors. Mentioning that South Africa offers more than 60,000 different and customised tourism packages to the visitors, Slabber claimed, under the new tax regime in India it would be much more beneficial for the leisure visitors to buy a package tour rather than paying separately for the stay and travel as less tax would be levied.

“If someone buys a package tour, he is going to pay five percent tax according to the new tax regime in India. However, if someone decides to break up the expenses and buy individual packages from individual operators, they would end up paying 18 percent tax under GST,” she said. Underscoring the massive opportunity of adventure tourism in their country, Slabber said Indian tourists are the biggest buyers of adventure packages there and thus helps in creation of more job opportunities among the locals compared to the tourists from other parts of the world.

“The Indians in South Africa pay for almost six activities in a day while the average tourists pay for only two. So in a way the Indian tourists help a lot more in terms of tourism related job creation in South Africa than the average tourists. They are also the biggest buyers of adventure packages,” she said. She also added that according to their records in the last few years, Indian women take up more adventure packages like bungee jumping and snorkelling, than the Indian men.

About tourists from Bengal, Slabber said Kolkata has been one of the most unique and rapidly growing source market driving tourist traffic to South Africa and said they are planning to customise Kolkata specific packages in South Africa. “The number of tourists from Bengal has gone up from two percent to seven percent in the last few years. “Also, this is the only market ever where we have been asked about art galleries, museums and more intellectual pursuit of holiday. That is something really unique about the market in West Bengal,” she added.

A Passionate Life: Writings by and on Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay

Edited by Ellen Carol Dubois and Vinay Lal Zubaan

Page: 483 Pages

Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay (1903–1988 ) is finally being remembered with the attention and repect she deserves, after 30 years of being consigned to the edge of memory, far from the cognizance of academics, freedom fighters, those engaged in gender studies, politicians, and even generations of craftsmen and women of India for whom she was a crucial lifeline after India attained Independence. Some die-hard craft lovers and surviving colleagues hold on tenaciously to her widely distributed legacy, but that has hardly been enough.

For too long, we have adopted the tendency to compartmentalise public activists, forgetting those who simultaneously contributed to a variety of fields, and stood on a wide range of platforms. Women in public life are particularly prone to this. In a world dominated by patriarchal mindsets, it minimises and marginalises them even more. In a world of specialists, a special woman who excels in many activities is lost between the divisions. Kamaladevi was one such person. Additionally, she often became a victim of the “darbar” system that operated in those days under Indira Gandhi, when “czarinas” ruled the cultural field and “favourites” held sway. In a poignant meeting with Kamaladevi in Bangalore, some months before she passed away, she sat sadly in the fading evening light, sharing with this writer her regret that all she had built up was being destroyed around her. She should not have felt that sad.

Editors Ellen Carol Dubois and Vinay Lal, both professors at UCLA, have put together this study with a perceptive and admiring foreword by the eminent feminist writer Gloria Steinem, who had met Kamaladevi briefly. Steinem, who has influenced peple the world over, writes, “Because of Kamaladevi, I also began to understand the politics of history… we often dismiss 95 per cent of the 100,000 or so years that humans have been around, call that ‘pre-history’ and only begin our study after patriarchy, hierarchy, monotheism, colonialism, racism, caste, class and other relatively new institutions began…” It shows the depth of women like Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay.

A Passionate Life presents a collection of Kamaladevi’s rarely available writings on various concerns, including women, their status and rights, and democratic socialism, often mistaken for communism.

This section includes an uncharacteristically sharp attack on Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, when he sarcastically belittled the socialists of India, calling them ‘reactionaries’ out of date with reality. Kamaladevi had worked closely with Nehru, Gandhi and a host of other leaders as an equal partner during the freedom movement. She advised them, collaborated with them on momentous occasions and pulled them up with a free and independent sense of autonomy when she felt they were going wrong.

Her wide range of interests and intellectual engagement with movements in the USA, Africa, China, Vietnam and other Asian countries, apart from cultural and creative expressions that demonstrated India’s special genius, shows up the hollow women leaders of today, who, like most of their male counterparts, wallow in localised issues. The will to engage with the world at large while fighting for the political, social and economic liberation of her own people is repeatedly highlighted in this collection of her writings during different periods of her life. The uniqueness of her political and creative thought process is manifest in Annie Devenish’s chapter: ‘Creativity as Freedom, Kamaladevi and the Politics of Self- Expression’. She analyses Kamaladevi’s statement “Freedom is not a theory, it is an experience” by saying, ‘What she meant was that the creative engagement of individuals with the world around them, whether in the name of art or politics, was an essential way for humans to express their freedom’.

Despite her constant study of and deep concern for the condition of women, she disliked being labeled a feminist and firmly stood her ground as a socialist, embracing the human rights of all. This valuable book makes it clear to the feminists of today (and that day) that India must have its own understanding, rooted in its own culture and history, of the rights and capacities of women that does not ape the western depiction of feminism.

The chapter on ‘Feminism and Women in India’, with a short introduction by one of the editors, is particularly significant in today’s unnecessary stand-off between right and left intellectuals. In 1929, when there was no battle about where and when Indian civilisation was great, debunking the claim that Indian women were inferior till the British came, Kamaladevi wrote, “In those beautiful days of the Vedic period of India, the glory of which still surrounds the country like a faint halo, women took part freely in the social and political life of the country, and, in the celebration of religious and cultural festivals, they had a special place of importance assigned to them.” She quotes the Rig Veda to list examples like Viswavara, Lopamudra, Vak, Maitreyi, Gargi and Tara as great philosophers and intellectuals of their time.

As a progressive, liberal, socialist promoter of the creative arts, craft and theatre, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay never pushed the ancient greatness of India aside. Maybe there is an important lesson in that.

"Olympic champion Almaz Ayana destroys field to win 10,000m at Worlds","Almaz Ayana won the gold medal with a timing of 30:16.32 seconds. (Source: Reuters) Almaz Ayana won the gold medal with a timing of 30:16.32 seconds. (Source: Reuters)

Ethiopian Almaz Ayana destroyed the field to win the 10,000 metres at the World Championships on Saturday, finishing around 300 metres clear of her rivals in her first race of an injury-plagued season.

The Olympic champion began pulling away from the field after 10 laps, sweeping past back markers who were made to look sluggish in comparison.

She finished in 30:16.32 seconds, well outside the world record she set when she won in Rio last year but still enough to win by an astonishing 46.37 seconds, by far the biggest margin in championship history.

Ayana’s compatriot Tirunesh Dibaba, the former world and Olympic champion, added to her impressive collection of medals when he took the silver with Kenya’s Agnes Tirop in third.

“I am very happy to win this title, much more than when I won the Olympic gold because I have been sick this year and didn’t expect it. In fact, this was my first race of 2017,” Ayana told reporters.

A repeat of her world record-breaking performance in Rio was never on the cards after a slow, tactical start to the race in which the field crawled around the first lap in 81 seconds.

But the last two thirds of the race was reminiscent of Ayana’s extraordinary run last year where she also blew away the field.

Ayana began pulling away after 10 laps and by the 12th had opened up a gap of 30 metres.

The 25-year-old ran the next three kilometres in 8:33 minutes as she continued to increase her advantage and began overhauling the backmarkers with eight laps to go.

Remarkably, Ayana’s prospects had been in doubt because injuries forced her to cancel a number of appearances at European meetings this season.

The battle for second turned into a three-horse race between Kenyans Tirop and Alice Nawowuna and the 32-year-old Dibaba.

Almost unnoticed, Dibaba, who is now focusing on running marathons, won the sprint to claim silver to sit alongside the five world championship and three Olympic golds she has won.

“I have only had two months of training, so I am happy to win silver this time,” she said.

“It was a very fast race. I knew that Almaz was going to run very fast so, if I had followed her, I wouldn’t have won a medal. I know my capacity these days because my training for this race was very short.”

Russian deputy minister blacklisted in new EU sanctions over Siemens turbines to Crimea,"FILE PHOTO: A logo of Siemens is pictured on a building in Mexico City, Mexico, May 16, 2017. (REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo) FILE PHOTO: A logo of Siemens is pictured on a building in Mexico City, Mexico, May 16, 2017. (REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo)

The European Union on Friday imposed sanctions on three more Russians, including Deputy Energy Minister Andrei Cherezov, and three Russian companies over the delivery of Siemens’ turbines to Moscow-annexed Crimea. The EU first introduced sanctions on Russia after the 2014 military takeover of the Black Sea peninsula from Kiev, and stepped them up repeatedly as Moscow then backed separatist unrest in the east of Ukraine.

The latest tightening comes in response to the delivery of Siemens’ gas turbines to Crimea in violation of EU sanctions, which bar doing business there since the annexation that has not been internationally recognised. Siemens says it has evidence that all four turbines it delivered for a project in southern Russia had been illegally moved to Crimea. The EU said the blacklisted companies include Siemens’ two Russian contractors that moved the turbines.

EU’s 28 states must be unanimous to go ahead with sanctions and diplomatic sources said Italy’s opposition meant a fourth name had to be dropped from the initial German proposal. Diplomats in Brussels said the Russian energy ministry official is involved in bilateral cooperation with Italy and has since escaped being sanctioned. The Italian representation in Brussels did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other EU sanctions on Russia target its energy, financial and arms sectors. The latest additions complement a blacklist that already contains 150 people and 37 entities subject to an asset freeze and a travel ban over the turmoil in Ukraine. More than three years of coordinated EU and U.S. sanctions, however, have not forced a change of hand in Moscow, which vows to never give back Crimea and still supports the armed conflict in east Ukraine which has killed more than 10,000 people.

"US: Explosion in Minneapolis school, two dead","Emergency personnel put water on the scene of school building explosion and collapse at Minnehaha Academy in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Wednesday. (Reuters) Emergency personnel put water on the scene of school building explosion and collapse at Minnehaha Academy in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Wednesday. (Reuters)

A second body was found in the rubble of a collapsed school building in Minneapolis after an explosion killed a school employee and injured several others, fire officials said Wednesday night. City Fire Chief John Fruetel said the body was recovered around 8 pm on Wednesday at the Minnehaha Academy. Fruetel said the medical examiner’s office is working to notify relatives.

The blast occurred in a utility as students were playing soccer and basketball at the private Christian school, which serves students from pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, according to fire and school officials. Contractors were working on one of the campus’ buildings at the time of the blast, which investigators believe was caused by a natural gas explosion, said Assistant Minneapolis Fire Chief Bryan Tyner. The explosion killed Ruth Berg, a receptionist for 17 years at the school who “welcomed everyone with a smile,” the school said in a statement.

John Carlson, a part-time janitor known for giving Dilly Bars to students, was reported missing. The 81-year-old attended the school as a child, sent his own children there, and was like a grandfather figure to students, school officials said. At a news conference Wednesday night, Fruetel did not specify whether Carlson’s body was the one located.

Four people remained hospitalized late Wednesday, including one in critical condition, at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, according to the hospital. Their names haven’t been released.

Dr. Jim Miner, the hospital’s chief of emergency medicine, said victims treated from the blast suffered injuries ranging from head injuries and broken bones to cuts from debris.

Aerial video footage of the school’s campus showed part of a building was ripped apart, with wood splintered and bricks scattered about. Windows in other areas were blown out and shattered. Three people were rescued from the building’s roof shortly after the explosion and fire, Tyner said.

Paul Meskan, who lives across the street, said he was pulling weeds when the blast happened, and he quickly ran over to the school. Meskan said he and other people who rushed to help found a man pinned under the rubble.

“We just started digging,” Meskan said. He said that after police and firefighters arrived, we kept digging, and gas, gas was going. Fire was going. And it’s like, ‘we’re not going back until we get this guy out of here.’ And we got him out, and they got him on a stretcher.”

The Star Tribune reported that city records show Master Mechanical Inc. was issued a permit on June 7 for “gas piping and hooking up meter” at the school’s address. Ryan Larsen, a company official, released a statement saying the company was monitoring the situation and referred questions to the Minneapolis Fire Department. Larsen wouldn’t confirm to The Associated Press that company workers were on site, saying: “We are trying to figure it out.”

Master Mechanical has twice been cited for workplace violations in recent years, according to the newspaper. Jenny O’Brien, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said in 2010 there was a violation related to protecting an employee from falling. In 2014, the company had paperwork violations.

At the time of Wednesday’s blast, as many as 10 students were playing basketball inside a gym at Minnehaha Academy but weren’t near the explosion, said Sara Jacobson, the school’s executive director of institutional advancement. Jacobson also was in the building during the explosion.

“There was a very loud explosion, and ceiling tiles and windows and materials rained down on our heads,” she said. “And then soon as it was over, we made our way down a dark hallway to the exit as quickly as we could.”

Gov. Mark Dayton released a statement saying his office was in contact with city officials and the state “will provide any and all resources necessary” to help first responders and ensure everyone is safe.

Dance Like a Man,"A scene from Netua A scene from Netua

In the village of Buxar in Bihar, where theatre director Dilip Gupta grew up, a wedding or a social celebration almost always included a dance by a woman who was actually a man. “The tradition was called launda naach or the netua naach. As children, we were fascinated by these normal-looking boys who would go into a room and emerge from it looking like women. We would peep from cracks in doors and open windows as he dressed up,” says Gupta. Earlier this month, the theatre director enlivened the story of these men who performed as women dancers in a play, titled Netua.

Who would watch a play about folk dancers from Bihar in the heart of Delhi? More than Shri Ram Centre in Mandi House could accommodate. Long after the curtain rose and the doors shut, the crowd kept growing outside the hall. The enterprising among them tried to look for secret entrances — up the steps that lead to the Green Room — or called “people inside”. Neither scheme worked. Netua was house full, with standing room near the walls and in the balcony taken. The air-conditioning barely managed to keep up.

Dilip Gupta Dilip Gupta

The play begins with a netua performer, called Jhamna, refusing to let his son join the profession. His reason forms the body of the script, and allows actor Raunak Khan to get under the skin of a dancer, who clings to his art even as people around him, especially a zamindar, become incapable of seeing him as a man. The exploitation — sexual and social — of the zamindar increases but Jhamna holds his ground until a terrible incident forces him to cast away his coloured skirt. The dances are energetic and the music evocative of the heartland but Netua suffers from uneven acting and tacky light design. Performers maintained the momentum of the play, and kept the audience applauding.

Gupta knows the terrain in which the play is set, and recreates the raw and rough. Netua also demonstrates the immersion of an artist into his character. Gupta’s past plays have included Urf Chocolate Friends, about migration, and Bathan, about caste politics and naxalite problems, among others. In Netua, a Saraswati Puja scene depicts a bhajan performed to the tune of a yesteryear Bollywood hit. A native of the region would recognise how folk music is increasingly being juxtaposed with film tunes.

India should make efforts to become global education hub: Kaushik Basu,"“I feel India can be a hub for higher education in the world,” Kaushik Basu said. “I feel India can be a hub for higher education in the world,” Kaushik Basu said.

Former World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu said that India should strive to become a global hub for higher education and attract students from developed countries to gain “economically” and start “get a soft power engagement with the world”.

“I feel India can be a hub for higher education in the world. People will come not just from developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America, but from United States for education. The American higher education market is extremely expensive…. India with its advantage of the English language, very good engineering and finance education can do this and it is possible. This will give India money, this is going to give a soft power engagement with the world. Historically, the countries that have done economically very well , typically have done this,” said Basu who was speaking at the twenty third Lalit Doshi Memorial Lecture in Mumbai on Friday.

Basu a Professor of Economics and C Marks Professor at Cornell University said apart from education, the country should not lose out in the health sector where it is doing well and has the potential to do much better.

“Health and healthcare is extremely expensive in the world… People (in India) have enterprise, provide the business ethos… And then this sector will sprout up on its own , you won’t need the government to push for this sector to come up,” said Basu. On the Indian economy, Basu said the country’s economic prospects are bright when compared to the current global situation.

“India has enacted a couple of laws, which I think are extremely beneficial. GST has teething trouble but it’s actually the absolutely right thing to do. The bankruptcy law is an excellent law that has been enacted,” said Basu. Basu said that while the GST is “not perfectly designed” and may have ” glitches” initially but these will gradually go away.

“To my mind the biggest benefit is GST allows goods to flow freely from one state to another. Not just freely, the amount of wastage bureaucratic interference that would take place before GST used to be huge. World Bank collected data that when a truck in India moves from one city to another going through a couple of states on average the truck is stationary 60 per cent of the time,” said Basu.

He also said that the new bankruptcy law if implemented well will help firms not just to close down but also help them start up quickly. “This bankruptcy law can change India’s position in the doing business ranking, which the World Bank produces,” said Basu.

Indiana soldier among 2 killed in Afghanistan attack,"In this July 24, 2014, Jonathan Hunter poses for a photo at a graduation ceremony at Fort Benning, Ga. (Photo via AP) In this July 24, 2014, Jonathan Hunter poses for a photo at a graduation ceremony at Fort Benning, Ga. (Photo via AP)

An Indiana soldier who was just 32 days into his first deployment was one of two American service members killed in a suicide bombing attack in Afghanistan, military officials confirmed. Mark Hunter said members of the Indiana National Guard informed him Wednesday night that his son, 23-year-old US Army Sgt. Jonathon Michael Hunter, died in the attack on a NATO convoy near the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.

The Department of Defense confirmed the deaths yesterday night. Officials also identified the second soldier killed as Army Spc. Christopher Michael Harris, 25, of Jackson Springs, North Carolina.

The US military in Afghanistan earlier said that four other American troops were wounded in Wednesday’s attack. Jonathon Hunter, who grew up about 40 miles south of Indianapolis in the central Indiana community of Columbus, left July 1 on his first deployment and was providing security for the convoy that was attacked, his father said.

He joined the Army in 2014 and was a member of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Mark Hunter said his son was excited about his first deployment, but that he, as an Army veteran, was apprehensive.

“He had been there 32 days. I’m former military, me and his uncle both, so we know the dangers,” Hunter told The Associated Press by phone from his home in Columbus. He said his son, who got married last October and has an older brother and two stepsisters, was cheerful, loving and religious.

“If you were down, he would cheer you up and he was God-loving. He was raised in the church,” he said.

The family later issued a statement saying in part, “Jonathon loved his unit and serving his country and was excited about the opportunity to go to Afghanistan to do his part in fighting injustice”.

Hunter said he will travel Friday to Dover Air Force Base to retrieve his son’s remains and that funeral plans were being determined by him, Jonathon’s mother and Jonathon’s wife, Whitney.

After graduating from Columbus East High School in 2011, he said his son spent a short time in Nashville, Tennessee, pursuing his dream of becoming a music producer before he enrolled at Indiana State University in Terre Haute, where he studied criminology and business.

But Hunter said his son eventually left ISU and joined the Army in April 2014 because he didn’t want to burden him with paying for his college.

“After he got into school and of course we were struggling with bills, to pay for it he decided to join. He said, ‘Dad, I know that going into the military I can get a free education,'” Mark Hunter said.

He said his family has a history of military service that dates back to the Civil War.

“I’m just proud of him. He was a great soldier. He made (sergeant) in a little over three years, which is pretty rare, they tell me,” Hunter said.

Before Jonathon Hunter’s death, 207 Indiana service members had died since 2002 in the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, or supporting those operations, said Tim Dyke, director of training and services Indiana Department of Veterans Affairs. He said that’s based on a tally produced by the agency’s former director.

Los Angeles still have business to settle on road to 2028 Olympics,"With LA now in position to host in 2028, the USOC and LA will try to expand that deal to eight years from 2021-28. (Source: File) With LA now in position to host in 2028, the USOC and LA will try to expand that deal to eight years from 2021-28. (Source: File)

About that deal to bring the 2028 Olympics to Los Angeles: Not all is set in stone. Sometime over the next five weeks, leaders from LA and the U.S. Olympic Committee have to iron out financial details about their joint marketing agreement that will figure heavily into the USOC’s ability to fund its athletes and sports organizations through those 2028 Games.

Sorting out the agreement is one of the biggest hurdles to clear before the IOC meets in the week of Sept. 11 in Lima, Peru, to approve Paris to host the 2024 Olympics and Los Angeles for 2028.

When a city is awarded the Olympics, it also takes over its country’s domestic sponsorship program for a six-year period leading into those Games. The idea is to prevent the country’s Olympic committee and the host city from selling competing sponsorships for essentially the same product.

In the United States, where individual sponsorship deals can reach into the tens of millions, that has resulted in delicate negotiations that haven’t always ended well and have hurt the chances of past bids in Chicago and New York. Deals with those cities were finalized at the last minute and some International Olympic Committee members have used the uncertainty as a reason to vote against the U.S. cities.

But early in the process of the 2024 bid, LA and the USOC locked in their deal. It was a six-year agreement in which the USOC was to receive 20 percent of the revenue worth somewhere around $380 million from the domestic deals that LA expects to negotiate.

With LA now in position to host in 2028, the USOC and LA will try to expand that deal to eight years from 2021-28. USOC CEO Scott Blackmun and LA chairman Casey Wasserman will talk soon about whether the 20-80 split will remain in place, and what other details need to change.

“I’m confident that we’ll find a deal that’s good for our athletes and (national governing bodies), and also good for LA 2028,” Blackmun told The Associated Press.

Los Angeles also has motivation to make a good deal for both sides. The last thing leaders there want to do is weaken Team USA, which will be competing on home turf in the Summer Games for the first time in 32 years. Wasserman said the parties are close to finalizing a revised agreement.

“USOC Chairman Larry Probst Scott Blackmun and I have been good friends for more than 20 years and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership for the next 11 years,” Wasserman said.

And yet, this could wind up more complex than a mere rubber-stamping of an extension of the same deal. At stake is something in the neighbourhood of $60 million a year, which totals up to about one-third of the USOC’s typical budget over a four-year cycle.

The USOC puts $75 million or more each year into direct support to athletes and the governing bodies that run the sports. The USOC is in a unique position because it does not receive government funding to support the athletes, and thus, doesn’t have an obvious way to make up any shortfall.

Even if the numbers work out, the USOC will feel some pain. Essentially, its marketing department, which employs about 50 people and is in charge of soliciting domestic partnerships, will become a shell of itself because LA takes charge of the deal-making. Some of those employees might lose jobs.

To give up that much control, Blackmun will want to cut a fair deal for the USOC. Ultimately, his goal is to retain an amount that would equal 20 to 30 percent of the USOC’s overall revenues (The federation averaged about $240 million in revenues over the last two years) so the U.S. team will have resources to remain dominant in 2028 and beyond.

LA is also seeking assurances, given the greater financial uncertainty that exists under an 11-year preparation window instead of seven. According to the 2024 and 2028 hosting contracts, the $1.8 billion it is receiving from the International Olympic Committee is only $100 million more than it would have gotten had it won the 2024 hosting rights.

LA did add one provision that allows it to spend a portion of the money on youth sports programs before the Olympics, and another that states all amounts will be calculated in 2028 value, though the contract gave no specifics of how that would work.

Chandigarh tops Union Territories with 36 snakebite deaths in 2016,"The number of snakebite deaths recorded in the country in 2016 (provisional) was 1064. (Source: Pixabay, Representational) The number of snakebite deaths recorded in the country in 2016 (provisional) was 1064. (Source: Pixabay, Representational)

CHANDIGARH RECORDED the highest number of deaths due to snakebite among all the Union Territories in 2016, revealed a report submitted by the Union Ministry of Health to the Lok Sabha.

The number of snakebite deaths recorded in the country in 2016 (provisional) was 1064. According to the report, a total of 36 snakebite deaths was reported from Chandigarh in 2016. In 2014 and 2015, the number of such deaths in the city were 10 and 16, respectively. The report, though, does not specify the places where these 36 people, who subsequently died in hospitals across the city, were bitten.

“Since Chandigarh has two major tertiary-care hospitals – Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Sector 12 and Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32 – patients from nearby cities and neighbouring states also come here for treatment. These 36, who eventually died here, may comprise patients from outside of Chandigarh too,” said Dr Rakesh Kashyap, Director Health Services (DHS), Chandigarh

According to the report, of the seven UTs, Chandigarh had the highest of 36 snakebite deaths, while Dadra & Nagar Haveli reported nine. Three UTs – Daman and Diu, Lakshwadeep and Andaman and Nicobar Islands – did not report any snakebite death in 2016. The country’s capital, Delhi, said the report, recorded one death, while Puducherry had five snakebite deaths last year.

Number of deaths caused by snake bite in 2016 in Union Territories. Number of deaths caused by snake bite in 2016 in Union Territories.

During the ongoing session of Parliament, two MPs, Hari Manjhi and Jugal Kishore, raised this issue and asked if these deaths across the country were due to lack of anti-snake venom. In its reply, the health ministry has said, “Central government provides assistance to the states to strengthen health infrastructure under the National Health Mission. This facilitates treatment for various diseases and emergencies, including snakebite. Health being a state subject, the ministry has asked the states to procure anti- snake venom serum under National Health Mission after reflecting the same in the annual PIP for approvals.”

In Chandigarh, experts said that since the city has forest areas in the vicinity, there is always a “high chance of snakebites”. “The exact reason why so many deaths occurred in the city could be confirmed only after studying each and every case. There is a possibility that there could be a delay in treatment or patients reaching hospital late,” Dr PVM Lakshmi, additional professor of the Department of Community Medicine at PGI, told Chandigarh Newsline.

The health ministry has also released a report of deaths due to rabies. There has been no death due to rabies in Chandigarh from 2014-2016. Of the seven UTs, only Delhi reported four rabies deaths last year. In the country, the number of deaths due to rabies was 86 in 2016.

Turkey reinforces military on Syria border: Reports,"A Turkish tanl on the Syrian border. (Source: Reuters) A Turkish tanl on the Syrian border. (Source: Reuters)

Turkey has sent military reinforcements to its southern border with Syria, dispatching artillery and tanks to the area overnight, Dogan news agency said on Saturday. It said six howitzers and tanks with military vehicles were sent to Kilis province across the border from the Kurdish-controlled Syrian region of Afrin.

The Turkish army has clashed with Kurdish forces and their allies in the area in recent weeks, exchanging artillery and rocket fire, according to Kurdish officials. The mounting tensions between two US allies in northwest Syria raised fears last month of another major front in the multi-sided Syrian war.

Turkey sees the Kurdish YPG militia – which has established autonomy in areas along Syria’s northern border with Turkey – as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers

Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades.

There was no immediate comment from Turkish officials. Ankara has said it has no plan to launch a war against the YPG but that its forces would be ready to respond to any hostile move from across the border.

Brazil President Michel Temer wins Congressional votes to block graft charge,"Brazil’s President Michel Temer delivers a speech after deputies of the lower chamber of Brazil’s Congress voted to reject a corruption charge against him at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil August 2, 2017. REUTERS/Adriano Machado Brazil’s President Michel Temer delivers a speech after deputies of the lower chamber of Brazil’s Congress voted to reject a corruption charge against him at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil August 2, 2017. REUTERS/Adriano Machado

Brazil’s lower house of Congress voted on Wednesday to reject a corruption charge against President Michel Temer for allegedly taking bribes, saving him from facing a possible Supreme Court trial that could have ousted him from office. Temer won enough ballots to keep the opposition from gaining the two-thirds of the vote required to move the corruption case forward to the top court.

But his support was less than hoped for and raised questions about the future of his economic reform agenda and how he will fare in future Congressional votes on more charges likely to be lodged against him.

The final tally showed 263 deputies voting in favor of Temer, 227 voting against him – well below the 300 votes in favor of the president that Beto Mansur, the government’s deputy whip in the lower chamber, predicted earlier Wednesday.

That puts in danger the chance legislators will even take up serious reform of Brazil’s pension system that is crucial to plug a wide budget deficit and revive investor confidence in an economy emerging from recession. Several key lawmakers have told Reuters in recent weeks they were inclined to shelve that effort until after the October 2018 presidential election.

But Temer vowed after the vote to press on, saying that “we will pass all the reforms that the country needs.”

He added: “Now it is time to invest in our country. Brazil is ready to start growing again.”

Shaky ground

Opposition lawmakers, carrying briefcases stuffed with fake money, chanted “Out with Temer!” on the House floor at the start of the day-long tumultuous session.

Temer’s main coalition ally, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), which seeks to win the presidential election next year, was split on whether to back Temer, whose economic policies it shares, or distance itself from his corruption-plagued government.

PSDB leader Ricardo Tripoli, calling for the charge to be approved, said Temer must be investigated, “not because we want to oust the president, but because Brazilians are tired of so much suspicion surrounding their politicians.”

To shield Temer only further undermines the credibility of Brazil’s political system, Tripoli said.

Brazil’s stocks and currency rose earlier on Wednesday after a cloture vote signaled a victory for Temer and robust support for his reform agenda to cut spending and restore confidence in government accounts.

Brazil’s top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot in June charged Temer with arranging to eventually receive a total of 38 million reais ($12.2 million) in bribes from the world’s largest meatpacker, JBS SA in return for political favors.

Temer and his legal team have denied any wrongdoing.

His supporters have said that Janot failed to provide proof that he had broken the law.

Lawmaker Paulo Abi-Ackel of the PSDB credited Temer with turning around the economy, falling inflation, interest rates and record unemployment, and early signs of renewed growth.

“Is this the right time to be removing the president?” he said on the House floor, appealing to his peers to clear Temer.

The deeply unpopular president had scrambled for support in recent days to avoid becoming the second president to be ousted in a year in a deepening crisis fueled by massive corruption investigations.

Temer’s hold on office could become precarious if new corruption charges are brought against him as expected. With the 2018 election year approaching, key lawmakers have told Reuters they would find it harder to back him again later his year.

Janot has said he would file at least two more graft-related charges against Temer before he steps down in mid-September.

Janot is considering filing the charges of obstruction of justice and racketeering sooner now that lawmakers have rejected the first corruption charge, an official with direct knowledge of the investigation told Reuters, requesting anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.

Janot’s team has to provide evidence linking Temer to a payment made by JBS to his right-hand man, Rodrigo Rocha Loures, who was arrested in June after he was caught in a police video rushing out of a Sao Paulo restaurant with a bag full of cash handed to him by a JBS executive.

"A King in Hiding: The barren, cold desert of Ladakh sees signs of a new life – the otter","Confluence of Zanskar and Indus Rivers (Source: Thinkstock images) Confluence of Zanskar and Indus Rivers (Source: Thinkstock images)

It was the last day of August and winter was preparing to make its presence felt. In a couple of months, the roads would be clogged with snow, and another harsh six-month winter would be endured in this cold desert. The sun had just begun to rise from behind the Himalayas, when a pair of researchers — Prof Melissa Savage and Pushpinder Singh Jamwal — stumbled upon what could potentially be their holy grail. Because it happened this quick — in 15 minutes, when they were prepared to toil for a month — they peered at it, and their luck, with disbelief. The treasure they were huddled over? Otter shit.

It had all the markings of otter shit — bits of fish scales, fins, bone and vertebrae cast into tubular poop. In the dry heat of Ladakh, it had desiccated and turned greyish-black. When they poked a stick in, it instantly withered and its contents spilled. For a brief instant, the chilly breeze off the river Indus was filled with a faint fishy smell, wafting up from the crumbled faeces.

Jamwal leaned over and zoomed his camera into the dried mass and clicked a few pictures which were sent to Dr Nicole Duplaix, the chair of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission’s Otter Specialist Group, an authority on otters. Her confirmation meant that, this was the first scientific evidence of the presence of otters in the trans-Himalayas.

The otter is a rare and elusive mammal living in aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems and is classified as ‘Near Threatened’ by the IUCN. Mustelid features and playful antics give otters an adorable air, but in a river ecosystem they are the top boss, the apex predator. Think of tigers in forests or snow leopards in the trans-Himalayas. These elusive weasels — hardly a foot long and weighing 7-12 kilos — rightfully stand next to them in stature. Otters are, however, better placed when compared to tigers and snow leopards, despite them being near threatened as well. Since the presence of top predators is usually proof of a healthy ecosystem, tangible evidence of otters would give us a lot of hope about the health of river ecosystems in the Indian trans-Himalayas.

Across the world, otter enthusiasts and experts are passionate over otter excrement, so much so that their poop has earned its own name — spraint. But this is no irrational obsession. Spraint is the truly reliable way to tracing otters. It is distinct and has its own smell — ranging from fresh, flowery to putrid and fishy. An otter’s diet mostly comprises fish, which means that their spraint is usually made of the parts of fish that can’t be digested, like bits of fish skeleton, scales and fins. The spraint has its own language, a code that tells all about the animal’s ecology.

Dr Nicole only had to look at the picture once to affirm that the spraint was indeed from the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra, one of the three otter species found in India. This was a big deal. Because otters potentially represent an ideal flagship species, their conservation would help in conserving the ecosystems they inhabit.

Savage and Jamwal searched for signs of otters along the Indus, Suru, Zanskar and Dras rivers of Ladakh. “But otters are not very common in the river. We had to hunt hard to find evidence of the species,” says the professor. “We worked along the Indus and Zanskar rivers, in steep gorges and along swampy, thorny thickets, looking for signs of the otter.” Less reliable than a spraint is the pug mark — the five-toed mark of an otter’s webbed feet, which may not be that defined on the sandy river beds of Ladakh. Still, at the end of their study, both had firmly established that otters were indeed present in the region. But where were they?

The next step of the study demanded photographic evidence. A difficult proposition since otters are more secretive than most creatures. Humans don’t appeal to them and, on even sensing human presence, they slip away. Perhaps, that’s why there is limited anecdotal evidence and, unlike other animals, they are yet to find a place in the tales and myths of the region.

But European writers have been in thrall of otters for long. Scottish naturalist and author Gavin Maxwell’s love for his pet otter can be seen all over Ring of Bright Water; and Henry Williamson’s Tarka (Tarka the Otter) is, perhaps, the most famous otter in the world. The otter was also muse to poets Seamus Heaney and Ted Hughes. While Heaney admires the qualities of Lutra lutra, his poem, An Otter, is ostensibly about a woman out of his reach, much like the otter: “I sat dry throated on the stones/ You were beyond me.”

Jamwal had to meticulously lay camera traps for close to a year to get a glimpse of one. Finally, an otter was caught on camera on the night of August 27, 2016. “I was highly sceptical of finding any otters in Ladakh until I stumbled upon a spraint myself,” he says with a laugh. At the time, he was captivated by the other elusive predator of the mountains, the snow leopard, of which he has an enviable photographic collection.

After this discovery, a systematic study of otter populations, their habitats and threat factors has started. Jamwal has embarked on a study on otter populations and is developing a sound educational programme for the region. “The local Ladakhi community is innately sensitive to their environment,” he says.

“Problems like over-fishing, which cause a decline in otter populations, are not prevalent here.”

Local Buddhists consider fish sacred and, hence, it is not eaten in the region, leaving all the fish for otters to devour with their dextrous forehands. “In Ladakh, there are many good conservation programmes focused on snow leopard, wolves, birds. We hope that this find will encourage the authorities to include otter conservation in management plans,” says Savage.

Men find sexual assault as traumatising as women do: Research,"These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research. (Source: File Photo) These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research. (Source: File Photo)

Men are often looked at only as perpetrators of sexual assaults. But what happens to those men who become victims of such assaults? These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research.

Sexual assault is unwanted sexual contact — including rape — and is a traumatising event linked to numerous mental health consequences associated with negative outcomes such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, fear, anxiety, alcohol dependence, use of illicit substances, suicidal ideation, and attempted suicide. While there is extensive research on the collateral consequences experienced by females, almost no research exists on how sexual violence affects adult, non-incarcerated males or how it affects them as compared to females.

The new findings, published in the journal Women & Criminal Justice, challenge a sociological theory that explains that men are more likely to respond to sexual assault with anger and by engaging in criminal activity, while women are more likely to respond with depression and sadness.

“When we began this study, we thought for sure that we would find that females who were sexually assaulted would exhibit higher depression scores than males who were sexually assaulted,” said lead researcher Lisa Dario, Assistant Professor at Florida Atlantic University in the US.

“I think this is probably because of antiquated ideas that men and women experience emotions differently. What we actually discovered, much to our surprise, is that sexual assault is traumatic regardless of gender,” Dario added. The study involved a sample size of 11,860 adults in the US — 5,922 men and 5,938 women — obtained from the National Violence Against Women Survey’s database.

The researchers found that all victims of sexual assault had higher depression scores than individuals who have had not experienced sexual assault in their lifetime.

Men make up about 38 percent of sexual assault and rape incidents reported, and those in the military are particularly vulnerable and more unlikely to report an assault, according to the US National Crime Victimisation Survey results. The researchers suspect that it is possible that men may even experience depression more than women because they do not have the social outlets and support systems available to women, and therefore may wind up internalising their feelings and emotions.

“There is no room for ‘sexism’ in sexual assault research [by ignoring male victims] and we must bring attention to an issue that impacts men equally, especially if we know that their negative emotional responses are treatable,” Dario said.

Senate panel approves bill to suspend US aid to Palestinians,"Sen Lindsey Graham, left, chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism. (Source: AP) Sen Lindsey Graham, left, chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism. (Source: AP)

A Senate committee approved legislation Thursday that would suspend US financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority until it ends what lawmakers said is a long-standing practice of rewarding Palestinians who kill Americans and Israelis. Members of the Republican-led Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 17-4 to pass the measure, sponsored by Sens Lindsey Graham, R-SC, and the committee chairman, Sen Bob Corker, R-Tenn.

Corker said the Palestinian Authority has “enshrined in law” a system that creates a monetary incentive for acts of terrorism by paying monthly stipends of as much as $3,500 to Palestinians who commit acts of violence and to their families. The amount of the payment depends on the length of the jail sentence they receive for the crime, he said.

“This is sick,” Corker said.

Husam Zomlot, chief representative of the Palestinian General Delegation to the US, called the legislation “misinformed and counterproductive.” He disputed Corker’s assessment of what he described as a 52-year old program “to support families who lost their breadwinners to the atrocities of the occupation, the vast majority of whom are unduly arrested or killed by Israel.”

Palestinians have argued that ending Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem lands Palestinians seek for their state is key to defeating terrorism.

“The program has served a social and security need to provide for our people, guarantee a better future for the children and protect the needy from the many radical groups around us,” Zomlot said in an emailed statement.

The bill is named for Taylor Force, an MBA student at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and a West Point graduate who was visiting Israel in March 2016 when he was stabbed to death by a Palestinian. Force was from Lubbock, Texas. His parents live in South Carolina.

Graham said the Palestinian Authority praised Force’s killer as a “heroic martyr” and he’s termed the payments “pay to slay.” He estimated that the Palestinian Authority has made $144 million in what he described as “martyr payments.”

“So if you’re a young Palestinian the best thing maybe you can do for your family in terms of income streams is to be terrorist,” Graham said. “That’s inconsistent with peace.”

The Trump administration’s budget request for fiscal 2018 includes roughly $260 million for economic development and law enforcement programs in the West Bank and Gaza. The internationally backed Palestinian Authority has tightened its grip in the West Bank since losing control of the Gaza Strip to the Islamic militant group Hamas a decade ago.

“Assistance in the West Bank and Gaza remains critical to advancing the United States’ long-standing national security priority of achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace,” according to a State Department budget documents.

A December report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said that since the mid-1990s the U.S. has committed more than $5 billion in economic and nonlethal security assistance to the Palestinians. The United States has, since 2015, cut foreign aid to the Palestinians by the same amount its government has spent on the payments for acts of terrorism.

But the legislation cleared by the committee would go a step further, a move that concerned several Democrats. They said they agreed with the intent of the bill, but feared withholding critically needed foreign aid would accelerate the problems in the West Bank and Gaza.

“There’s poverty, there are a lot of checkpoints, there’s hopelessness,” said Sen Tom Udall.

Before foreign aid can resume, the State Department would be required to certify to Congress that the Palestinian Authority has terminated the payments for acts of terrorism and has revoked any law or decree that allows a compensation system for imprisoned Palestinians, according to the bill.

The committee agreed to adjust the legislation so that the aid payments would go into an escrow account that could be accessed once the laws establishing the prisoner payments are revoked. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., had argued the Palestinian Authority would have greater motivation to change if it knew the money had not been cut off completely.

"Professor, Oxford employee arrested in California over Illinois stabbing","The two men were each arrested on a charge of murder, Farrell said The two men were each arrested on a charge of murder, Farrell said

Police in California arrested on Friday a Northwestern University professor from Illinois and an employee of Britain’s Oxford University, who were both sought in connection with a fatal stabbing in Chicago last week, authorities said. Professor Wyndham Lathem was arrested by U.S. Marshals in Oakland, California, and Oxford employee Andrew Warren was taken into custody by police in nearby San Francisco, said Ed Farrell, a supervisory inspector for the US Marshals Service.

Authorities have been searching for Lathem, 42, and Warren, 56, since discovering the body of Trenton Cornell Duranleau in Chicago on July 27, police said. The two men were each arrested on a charge of murder, Farrell said.

Chicago police said in a statement: “Both individuals will be held accountable for their actions and we hope today’s arrest brings some comfort for the victim’s family.” Both men are slated to appear in court in California, where authorities will seek to have them transferred to Chicago. Lathem and Warren could not be reached for comment.

Lathem, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology, sent family and friends a video in which he apologized for his involvement in the slaying, police said on Friday. The US Marshals Service tracked him to Oakland and contacted him, arranging for him to surrender, Farrell said by phone.

Earlier in the case, the manhunt took police to Lake Geneva, a resort community in Wisconsin. A day after the killing, a man who may have been Lathem made a $1,000 donation in the victim’s name to a library in that town, police said.

Chicago police had earlier identified the victim as Trenton Cornell, but have since said his full name was Trenton Cornell Duranleau. He was 26 and had studied cosmetology, according to local media. His body was discovered in Lathem’s Chicago apartment, according to the Chicago Tribune. He had stab wounds to his back and investigators found a knife with a broken blade in the kitchen’s trash can and another knife near the sink, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified law enforcement sources.

Lathem and Cornell Duranleau knew each other and had “some type of falling out”, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Tribune. It was not clear how Warren, who was visiting from Britain, knew the other two men. Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Somerville College, part of the Oxford University network, the college said.

(Source: Reuters) Ravichandran Ashwin celebrates with Cheteshwar Pujara after taking the wicket of Sri Lanka’s Angelo Mathews. (Source: Reuters)

Cheteshwar Pujara is renowned for his sublime batting skills but on Saturday he showed that he is a sharp fielder as well and has a lot more in his arsenal. This was after he plucked a spectacular catch to dismiss at leg slip to dismiss Angelo Mathews. Pujara is not considered as one of the sharpest fielders in the Indian team, however with this effort perceptions are bound to change.

The incident took place in the 34th over when the ball was turning sharply. R Ashwin bowled an off-spinner which pitched on the middle and off stump and spun viciously. Mathews tried to dab it down towards the fine leg region but an alert Pujara picked up out of thin air. Judging by the celebrations even Pujara was delighted at his feat.

Earlier, Pujara had revealed in an interview that he has been practising slip catching and is putting in a lot of hard work along with fielding coach R Sridhar. He is no doubt one of the best catchers on the field.

Since his return from the injury, Pujara has been working on his fitness and fielding. He recently spoke about it in an interview and said, “When you get injured, you need to get that rhythm going for you again as your concentration goes down. The injury was the toughest part of my career but now I have come out of it and I am working hard on my fitness.”

4.2 lakh careers could be on the line: What’s wrong at Mumbai University?,"The delay in declaring the results apart, students also fear the new system will lead to inaccurate or unfair assessments of their performance. Express Archive The delay in declaring the results apart, students also fear the new system will lead to inaccurate or unfair assessments of their performance. Express Archive

The University of Mumbai, the largest and oldest in Maharashtra, faces an unprecedented crisis — final year results are delayed like never before, and the future of close to 4.2 lakh students — 90% of the over 4.7 lakh who wrote the exams in April-May — is on the line.

What is going on? Why are the results delayed?

The 160-year-old university has traditionally declared final year results by mid-June. This year, results of only 200-odd of the 477 examinations have been declared so far. A delay of another week is expected.

This delay of almost two months has been attributed to the university’s decision to hastily introduce a process of “on-screen assessment”. Students and politicians are now holding Vice Chancellor Sanjay Deshmukh responsible for putting the future of students in jeopardy — the VC has been accused of unilaterally deciding to overhaul the entire system, despite calls from all quarters to introduce the change in a phased manner. Student organisations and opposition parties want the VC to resign as punishment for his “short-sightedness”; the issue has also figured prominently in the monsoon session of the Legislative Assembly.

But what is this “on-screen assessment”? Why did the University of Mumbai have to embrace it?

On-screen marking or OSM is a way to evaluate answersheets using technology. Answersheets are scanned on to computers, and the evaluation and marking is done digitally. The Central Board of Secondary Education, Manipal University, Rajasthan Administrative Services and Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences in Bengaluru are some of the institutes that use this method of assessment, apart from Mumbai University. By itself, the method is considered scientific.

The OSM switch was triggered by a cheating scandal. In May 2016, the Bhandup police busted a racket in which answersheets were extracted from the university campus, tampered with, and replaced. Following the bust, the VC announced in January this year that all final year answersheets would be evaluated digitally.

So, what went wrong?

There are a host of reasons for the delay, but the key factor was the university’s failure to appoint an agency to help with implementing the new system in time. Bids for hiring the agency were invited ahead of time, but the response from private parties was lukewarm. The deadline to close the online tendering process was extended four times. To attract contractors, the university also eased the technical criteria. Finally, at the fifth attempt, an agency was appointed on April 27 — which meant that the process of assessment, which usually begins three days after the exams, was delayed by more than a month.

The university also did not have the infrastructure to handle the transition, and the teachers were unacquainted with the new system. After a hastily arranged training process, when teachers began assessments, technical glitches surfaced, slowing things down.

How does the delay affect students?

Over 4.2 lakh final year students stare at the prospect of losing a year. Students who have secured admission to universities abroad or within the country are in a helpless situation. The deadline to submit documents is usually in the first week of August. The admission and visa application processes are stuck in the absence of results. Those looking for jobs, too, are in a difficult situation — students have complained that prospective employers are unwilling to wait indefinitely for the university to declare results.

An overwhelming concern is that glitches in the system might lead to discrepancies in marking and inaccurate assessments.

What are the government and the university doing about the crisis?

Following uproar in the media, Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, who is also Chancellor of the University of Mumbai, set a deadline of July 31 for the declaration of results. The government appointed an expert as Officer on Special Duty to help with the assessment and to monitor its progress. The university decided to delegate some of the assessment work to teachers in other state universities such as Nagpur, Pune and Aurangabad. But this has not made a significant difference.

After outrage in the House, the government has now launched a probe into the delay in the declaration of results.

"Apple iPhone 7S Plus dummy model reveals glass back, wireless charging","Apple iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are expected to ship with fast charging as well. Previous reports have already hinted at wireless charging in iPhone 8. Apple iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are expected to ship with fast charging as well. Previous reports have already hinted at wireless charging in iPhone 8.

Apple iPhone 8, along with successors to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus are expected to be unveiled in September. Now tipster Sonny Dickson seems to have shared dummy models of the upcoming iPhone 7S Plus smartphone with 9to5 Mac. Going by the pictures, Apple will likely ditch aluminium chassis for the iPhone 7S Plus and go for an all-glass back instead. Rest of the aesthetics of the new device remain the same as iPhone 7 Plus with horizontally-aligned dual rear camera setup on the left and flash unit placed besides it.

Apple iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are expected to ship with fast charging as well. Previous reports have already hinted at wireless charging in iPhone 8. The year 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of iPhones and iPhone 8 is expected to come with a radical new design. iPhone 7S Plus is supposed to sport a 5.5-inch display, while iPhone 7s will come with a 4.7-inch screen. Both the iPhones will get LCD screen.

According to Ming Chi-Kuo, analyst with KGI Securities, iPhone 8 will have the highest screen-to-body ratio seen in any smartphone. It will feature a 5.8-inch edge-to-edge OLED display, but Apple will leave some space for the front facing camera, and sensor. Additionally iPhone 8 is expected to sport vertically aligned dual rear cameras, which is said to help with augmented reality features.

Both rear and front cameras in iPhone 8 will be capable of shooting 4K videos at 60 frames per second, reported Portuguese site iHelp. Currently, iPhone 7 Plus can shoot 4K videos, but only at 30 frames per second. The front camera, on the other hand, can shoot videos in 1080p.

Apple iPhone 8 will launch in September, though the device will be available in limited quantities, according to Rod Hall, Apple analyst at JP Morgan. Apple iPhone 8 could be company’s most expensive phone till date given it could bear a price-tag of $1000 (or approx Rs 63,675).

Behind India’s unease with a global child abduction law,"A significant piece of legislation was introduced in the US Congress last week — the Bindu Philips and Devon Davenport International Child Abduction Return Act of 2017 seeks to punish countries that do not adhere to US court orders on the return of abducted children.

(Representational Image/AP)

A significant piece of legislation was introduced in the US Congress last week — the Bindu Philips and Devon Davenport International Child Abduction Return Act of 2017 seeks to punish countries that do not adhere to US court orders on the return of abducted children. The Bill is named after two women — an Indian American and a Brazilian American — who allege their children were abducted and taken to India and Brazil by their husbands.

Back home, India has been struggling for years with legislation on the custody of children caught in transnational marital discord. The central government decided last year to not ratify The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (1980), which would force Indian women who return with their children after conflict with their husbands, to go back to the foreign country for settlement of custody.

A Committee headed by Punjab and Haryana High Court Justice Rajesh Bindal subsequently studied the issue in depth. Last month, the committee released a concept note on its recommendations.

What is The Hague Convention on international child abduction?

It is an international treaty to ensure the prompt return of a child who has been “abducted” from the country of their “habitual residence”. Ninety-seven countries are party to the Convention. Despite pressure from the US and European countries, India is yet to ratify it. Under the Convention, contracting countries must establish a central authority to trace unlawfully removed children and secure their return to the country of habitual residence, irrespective of the country’s own laws on the issue. The Convention applies to children under age 16.

Where does India stand on this matter?

In 2009, the Law Commission of India recommended signing The Hague Convention, because it “will in turn bring the prospects of achieving the return to India of children who have their home in India”. The Commission observed that in the absence of a law, Indian courts had not followed a pattern in such cases.

In February 2016, Punjab and Haryana High Court again referred the matter to the Law Commission and Ministry of Women and Child Development. In his interim order, Justice Rajive Bhalla (now retired) noted that “the removal or retention of a child in breach of custody rights is a wrong under The Hague Convention but for want [of] the Union of India acceding to The Hague Convention or enacting a domestic law, children will continue to be spirited away from and to India, with courts and authorities standing by in despair”.

The court asked the Commission and the Ministry to “consider whether recommendations should be made for enacting a suitable law and for signing The Hague Convention…”.

In June 2016, a draft Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction Bill, 2016, with provisions similar to The Hague Convention, was uploaded on the Ministry website for public comments. After examining the Bill and the issue, the Law Commission submitted a revised version of the Bill, called The International Child Removal and Retention Bill, 2016, in October, in line with The Hague Convention and legal precedents in the country.

What were the key recommendations?

The Commission noted that “women involved in cross-jurisdictional divorces, ‘holiday marriages’ or ‘limping marriages’ have to face additional challenges in the custody battle”, and that “the woman must not be put in a situation where she has to make the impossible choice between her children and putting up with an abusive relationship in a foreign country”.

In most cases of so-called “parental abduction”, parents take away the child because “of the fear of losing his/her custody”, the Commission said — “such an abduction… is out of overwhelming love and affection and not to harm the child or achieve any other ulterior purpose”. The Commission, thus, dropped the word ‘abduction’ from the title of the revised Bill.

The report did not, however, remove the previous Bill’s provisions on sending the child back to her habitual residence, as envisaged by The Hague Convention. It also retained the provision that gave the central authority the power “to secure the voluntary return of any such child to the country (of)… habitual residence, (and) to bring about an amicable resolution of the differences” between the parties in the dispute.

Given the draft Bill is largely in conformity with The Hague Convention, why is India still not keen to join the treaty?

Critics have argued that the legislation would affect the interests of Indian mothers fleeing from abusive or difficult marriages. The law, the critics said, would compel these women to return to the foreign country where the child was born, to fight for custody in possibly unfavourable conditions. The Ministry of Women and Child Development, wary of Indian women being charged or prosecuted in foreign countries, declined to back the law.

In February 2017, at a national consultation on signing the Convention chaired by WCD Minister Maneka Gandhi and attended by judges from the Delhi and Punjab and Haryana High Courts and a member of the Law Commission among others, it was again decided to constitute a committee to draft suitable legislation, and to advise on whether India should become a signatory. The committee was asked to submit its report in four months.

What has happened since then?

Last month, the committee, comprising two Punjab and Haryana HC judges, a Delhi HC judge, the chairman of the Punjab NRI Commission, a family law expert, and six representatives of various Ministries released a concept note for public suggestions. The committee is learnt to have received a large number of representations, and its major challenge is to reconcile contradictory views.

The foremost legal question is which court will have jurisdiction to decide custody — one in the country of habitual residence, or one where the child has been removed which, in most cases, is India. The committee has not met after the compilation of the feedback, and its report has been delayed.

"Rain Down on Me: If you bring Miyan Malhar into your life, monsoon is all yours","Known to be the creation of Tansen, Miyan ki Malhar was not even remotely the usual suspect among the first ragas to be taught to a novice in Hindustani classical music. Known to be the creation of Tansen, Miyan ki Malhar was not even remotely the usual suspect among the first ragas to be taught to a novice in Hindustani classical music.

Much before I could appreciate rain in all its splendour, a lot of credit for which goes to a book — Alexander Frater’s enchanting Chasing the Monsoon — I “felt” rain for the first time in a large room in a small house. The large room I speak of was the music room in a small apartment, where Swati Roy, a practitioner of the Banaras gharana gayaki, taught all of life’s dramas through notes. I was 13 and had just been accepted as her disciple. In the years that were to follow, her improvisations in the shringar ras ragas such as Maru Bihag and Bhairavi, would make me believe in the idea of love, renditions of Maalkauns would plunge me into sadness while Bhoop would evoke what my agnostic heart felt closest to devotion. But, on this first day of my official entry into the Banaras gharana, when I had no idea how rigorous the next few years of training were going to be, my teacher began the lesson of music with Miyan ki Malhar.

Known to be the creation of Tansen, Miyan ki Malhar was not even remotely the usual suspect among the first ragas to be taught to a novice in Hindustani classical music. Most music gurus did not touch the raga for, at least, a couple of years — it was every bit as arduous to master as it was mellifluous, and, one needed to understand the nuances of music before one could appreciate its complexity. I was familiar with the basic grammar of a few ragas that my mother and my music teacher at school had taught me, but not much more. But then, Hindustani classical music is all about devotion to one’s guru and surrendering without any questions asked. So, after the first half hour of singing sa — the base note in Hindustani classical music — and merging it with the rhythmic drone of a tanpura, we moved to the aaroh and avroh of Miyan ki Malhar. Just before we began, my guru told me about the legend of Mian Tansen, who would sing the raga to please the rain gods. “Would it really rain?” I asked, dumbfounded. “The rendition was always faultless and rigorous. It always did,” she said, with confidence.

“Bijuri chamke, barse/ Meherwa, aayi badariya/ Garaj garaj mohe atahi daraave” — the bandish swirled in the air around me and hung there. I sang along, parroting every note. And, somehow, over every repetition, while I ascended and descended over the basic bandish of Miyan Malhar, a hot and humid day in June became magically transformed. With only an old fan for company and sweat trickling down my spine, rain reached the most obscure nooks of my heart. We were working with six notes when we descended, all seven in the ascent, creating various permutations and combinations that were slowly unfurling the raga’s inescapable magic in my soul.

I left my guru’s house just as dusk began to fall. My father, who’d been waiting downstairs, heard about Miyan Malhar and began telling me a story of the time when emperor Akbar, prodded by his courtiers, asked Tansen to sing raga Deepak. As the folklore went, the raga was known to light oil lamps when sung accurately. Tansen attempted the raga so fervently that the lamps got lit, but soon, the heat began to burn his body and he fell ill. A nation-wide search was launched to find someone who could please the rain gods with their recital. Two sisters, Tana and Riri, in Vadnagar in Gujarat passed the test. Tansen was taken to Vadnagar and Tana and Riri sang the raga to nurse him back to health. But, when Akbar summoned the sisters to sing in his court, the two committed suicide as they had vowed to sing only in front of their family deity. Vadnagar still holds an annual classical music festival known as the Tana and Riri festival.

It would be many more years before I would discover Pakistani singer Ustad Salamat Ali Khan’s rendition of the same raga in Satyajit Ray’s Jalsaghar. One of the torchbearers of the Sham Chaurasi gharana, Khan sang a different bandish in the same raga, Garjat boondan barse. Pandit Jasraj’s rendition of the same bandish — Ab ke baras tohe jaane na doongi, Sada rangeele Mohammad Shah — gives the piece the turns and twists of the Mewati gharana. The same popular bandish was rendered by Kishori Amonkar. Vani Jairam’s timeless rendition of Bole re papihara in Jaya Bachchan’s debut film, Guddi, is yet another favourite of mine. I heard every word, every note, like they were my heart’s tales. It even made a poet out of me for a while. Then, there is a surreal Ustad Vilayat Khan performance of Miyan Malhar, which took place in Chicago in 1980 — live performances of that calibre are hard acts to come by. But, the one composition that takes my breath away is Suresh Wadekar’s Badal ghumad bhar aaye in Zakir Hussain’s Saaz. Composed by Yashwant Dev, it has got to be Wadekar’s most underrated rendition, and one of his finest. Every time I play it, it reminds me of the stories I heard of the raga as a child.

Somewhere in the middle of the story my father was telling me, I began to notice that the sky was turning dark and it was not just because of dusk. By the time we reached home, there was rain and the sound of distant thunder. I distinctly remember the rush of the wind that made the jamun tree across our balcony break into a joyful dance. I sat down on a chair and began humming Miyan Malhar to the sound of incessant patter. And there it was — solace, and satisfaction, and, the kind of happiness that only music can provide.

Which is why, when I meet people who say that they aren’t into music, I tell them of Miyan Malhar and the magic it can bring to people’s lives. I tell them of the 13-year-old and her wonderful discovery of rain. For, if you bring Miyan Malhar to life, monsoon is all yours.

UN imposes tough new sanctions on North Korea,"The U.S.-drafted resolution, negotiated with North Korea’s neighbor and ally China, is aimed at increasing economic pressure on Pyongyang to return to negotiations on its nuclear and missile programs a point stressed by all 15 council members in speeches after the vote.(Representational image) The U.S.-drafted resolution, negotiated with North Korea’s neighbor and ally China, is aimed at increasing economic pressure on Pyongyang to return to negotiations on its nuclear and missile programs a point stressed by all 15 council members in speeches after the vote.(Representational image)

The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved tough new sanctions Saturday to punish North Korea for its escalating nuclear and missile programs including a ban on coal and other exports worth over $1 billion a huge bite in its total exports, valued at $3 billion last year.

U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley called the resolution “the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regime” and “the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation.”

But she warned that it is not enough and “we should not fool ourselves into thinking we have solved the problem not even close.”

“The threat of an outlaw nuclearized North Korean dictatorship remains … (and) is rapidly growing more dangerous,” Haley told council members after the vote.

The U.S.-drafted resolution, negotiated with North Korea’s neighbor and ally China, is aimed at increasing economic pressure on Pyongyang to return to negotiations on its nuclear and missile programs a point stressed by all 15 council members in speeches after the vote.

U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: “The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!”

The Security Council has already imposed six rounds of sanctions that have failed to halt North Korea’s drive to improve its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons capabilities.

The resolution’s adoption follows North Korea’s first successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States on July 3 and July 27.

It condemns the launches “in the strongest terms” and reiterates previous calls for North Korea to suspend all ballistic missile launches and abandon its nuclear weapons and nuclear program “in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.”

The centerpiece is a ban on North Korea exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood products and a ban on all countries importing these products, estimated to be worth over $1 billion in hard currency.

According to a Security Council diplomat, coal has been North Korea’s largest export, earning $1.2 billion last year which was then restricted by the Security Council in November to a maximum $400 million. This year, Pyongyang was estimated to earn $251 million from iron and iron ore exports, $113 million from lead and lead ore exports, and $295 million from fish and seafood exports, the diplomat said.

The resolution also bans countries from giving any additional permits to North Korean laborers another source of money for Kim Jong Un’s regime. And it prohibits all new joint ventures with North Korean companies and bans new foreign investment in existing ones.

It adds nine North Koreans, mainly officials or representatives of companies and banks, to the U.N. sanctions blacklist, banning their travel and freezing their assets. It also imposes an asset freeze on two companies and two banks.

The council diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly and insisted on anonymity, called the newly sanctioned Foreign Trade Bank “a very critical clearing house for foreign exchange.”

The Mansudae Overseas Project Group of Companies, which was also added to the blacklist, is described in the resolution as engaged in exporting workers for construction, including of monuments, in Africa and Southeast Asia.

The resolution asks the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea to ban the import of many more so-called dual-use items, which have commercial purposes but can also be used in conventional, biological, chemical or nuclear weapons.

It also gives the committee a green light to designate specific vessels that are breaking sanctions from entering ports all over the world and to work with Interpol to enforce travel bans on North Koreans on the sanctions blacklist.

The resolution expresses regret at North Korea’s “massive diversion of its scarce resources toward its development of nuclear weapons and a number of expensive ballistic missile programs” _ a point stressed by Haley.

It notes U.N. findings that well over half the population lacks sufficient food and medical care, while a quarter suffers from chronic malnutrition.

“These sanctions will cut deep, and in doing so will give the North Korean leadership a taste of the deprivations they have chosen to inflict on the North Korean people,” Haley said. “Revenues aren’t going toward feeding its people. Instead, the North Korean regime is literally starving its people and enslaving them in mines and factories in order to fund these illegal missile programs.”

Though the economic sanctions have teeth, Washington didn’t get everything it wanted.

In early July, Haley told the Security Council that if it was united, the international community could cut off major sources of hard currency to North Korea, restrict oil to its military and weapons programs, increase air and maritime restrictions and hold senior officials accountable.

Neither oil nor new air restrictions are included in the resolution.

Its adoption follows U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s comments Wednesday reassuring North Korea that Washington is not seeking regime change or an accelerated reunification of the Korean Peninsula comments welcomed by China’s foreign minister.

China’s U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi said the Chinese government hopes the United States will translate these commitments “into concrete policies” toward North Korea.

Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow hopes Tillerson’s assurances “would be clear that the United States is not seeking to dismantle the existing … situation (in North Korea) or to force to reunite the country or militarily intervene in the country.” Tillerson also said the United States wants to talk eventually with North Korea but thinks discussions would not be productive if Pyongyang comes with the intention of maintaining its nuclear weapons.

North Korea has repeatedly said it will never give up its nuclear arsenal, which it sees as a guarantee of its security.

The resolution reiterates language from previous ones supporting a return to six-party talks with the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula; expressing the Security Council’s commitment “to a peaceful, diplomatic and political solution to the situation”; and stressing the importance of maintaining peace and stability in northeast Asia.

Liu said “China has been making tireless efforts to promote denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to uphold peace and stability” and will keep working to convince other governments to support its suspension-for-suspension proposal.

Under the proposal and a roadmap supported by Russia, North Korea would suspend nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the U.S. and South Korea suspending their joint military exercises. It also includes security measures for both North Korea and South Korea leading to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

But Haley told the Security Council that U.S.-South Korean military exercises have been carried out regularly and openly for nearly 40 years and “they will continue.”

Russia’s Nebenzia stressed that sanctions “need to be a tool for engaging the country in constructive talks” and must not be used for “economic asphyxiation” of the country or “to deliberately worsen the economic situation.”

Six must-watch celestial events you shouldn’t miss this August,"Stargazers are in for a treat this month. (AP Photo/For representation only) Stargazers are in for a treat this month. (AP Photo/For representation only)

Stargazers are in for a treat this August as it is packed with celestial events: Right from a meteor shower to a total solar eclipse, it is going to be one hell of a show this month. Here are the details of the astronomical events that are all set to take place in August this year.

Partial Lunar Eclipse – August 7

A partial lunar eclipse will occur on the night of August 7 and will continue until early hours of next morning. The eclipse, that occurs when the earth moves between the sun and the moon, will be visible all over Asia, Europe and Africa. The partial eclipse is slated to start before 11 pm in India and will end at around at 12.48 pm. Lunar eclipses are safe to watch with the naked eye and require no special equipment. However, the Nehru Planetarium will be setting up telescopes at the Teen Murti lawns from 9 pm where the astronomical enthusiasts can enjoy the view.

Perseid Meteor Shower – August 12

Known to be one of the most famous meteor showers across the globe, Perseid meteor showers has been running for a couple of weeks now. However, between the evening of August 12 until the early morning hours of August 13, you can watch up to 100 shooting stars in an hour. Those interested must be far away from the city lights as the new moon may dampen the show otherwise.

Aldebaran – August 16

Said to be one of the brightest stars in the Taurus zodiac constellation, Aldebran is at a whopping 65 light-years distance away from the Earth. The giant star, known to be the eye of the Taurus-the Bull, will be close to the upper right of the moon on August 16. The star also has great mythological significance and is said to be the Moon’s favorite wife.

Venus – August 19

The second planet in our solar system, Venus will accompany the moon on August 19. Enthusiasts can click stunning pictures of Venus from early hours of Saturday at around 3 am until 4 pm in the evening.

Total Solar Eclipse – August 21

The most talked about astronomical phenomenon of the year is finally here. What makes this event even more special is that it is happening for the first time in 99 years. The moon will completely block the sun and the best place to view this spectacular sight would be North America. Sadly, the Great American Eclipse, as it is also called, will not be visible from India.

Jupiter and Spica – August 25

On this day, the largest planet in the solar system Jupiter will be seen at a close distance from the moon. The celestial duo can be watched from 9 am in the morning to 9 pm in the night on August 25. Grab a pair of binoculars and you might be lucky to also spot Spica, the brightest star in the Virgo constellation.

Just hope for clear skies this month and you might actually end up experiencing surreal astronomical sights.

Moscow reserves the right to take retaliatory measures over new European Union sanctions but also reaffirms its interest in keeping and developing economic cooperation with the bloc, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday.

The EU on Friday imposed sanctions on three more Russians, including Deputy Energy Minister Andrei Cherezov, and three Russian companies over the delivery of Siemens turbines to Moscow-annexed Crimea.

“The responsibility for this decision, including possible expenses for Siemens and other German and European companies working in Russia, lies entirely with the EU’s side and the German government,” the ministry said in a statement.

Navigating the Labyrinth: Perspectives on India’s Higher Education System

Edited by Devesh Kapur and Pratap Bhanu Mehta

Publication: Orient Blackswan

Pages: 273 pages

This valuable collection explores the complexities, future directions and reasons for the ‘weak record in human development’ of the world’s third largest higher education system. The introduction sets the ball rolling through an excellent historical as well as contemporary account. Particularly notable is the focus on quality, access, financing and internationalisation.

Apoorvanand Jha’s fascinating and personalised account of higher education in Bihar might be understood as a heart-rending marsiya (lament): there is fervour, sacrifice, effort and, inevitably, tragedy. The chapter points to the significance of social and political contexts — caste, destructive student politics, etc — that make or unmake institutions. His story is also one of the social death of provincial towns. Sachi Hatikenaka’s contribution addresses the quality problem through exploring the case for multidisciplinary research universities. Rigorous research capacity should be at the heart of developing institutions that are able to engage with the real problems of India. However, it remains to be seen whether our decision makers are willing to accept the advice that this doesn’t simply mean producing more PhDs and there ought to be a focus upon creating ‘elite’ institutions that serve as exemplars.

It is the ‘elite’ stigma of vocationalisation that engages Manish Sabharwal and Srinivasan Kannan. They suggest that a genuine interest in human welfare should mean a well-designed and adequately-resourced vocationalised university system. The degraded system we currently have has proved ineffective as a tool for social mobility for the majority. Greater emphasis on vocational skills and qualifications, they argue, holds significant potential to address the needs of some of the most marginalised sections of the population, such as workers in the unorganised sector.

Useful education for the marginalised also concerns the chapter by Megha Agarwal on the state’s focus on skills development schemes. An effective skills development training system, Agarwal rightly argues, holds significant potential to shift many from the vast informal sector to formal one. The chapter focuses on government initiatives and provides a comprehensive account of the various kinds of scheme and organisations involved in the skills endeavour. Tellingly, the word ‘quality’ finds recurring mention. I counted at least 16 instances.

Jeemol Unni and Sudipa Sarkar explore the ‘demand’ side of educational qualifications, that is, the view from the employers’ side. The authors map India’s occupational landscape and suggest that the demand for those with higher education qualifications has increased in many occupations (the service sector, for example). The article makes an implicit case for higher education of the kind that employers demand. But, how to ensure that students gain access to the best quality higher education in an era of declining state funding for state institutions? KP Krishnan’s contribution suggests that student loans schemes overseen by the state — hence ensuring adequate attention to issues of access and equity — ought to be explored. This will involve a shift from financing institutions to financing students.

In their nuanced reading of legal cases involving higher education over the past six decades, Devesh Kapur and Madhav Khosla’s chapter dwells upon the key aspects and changes that characterise the sector. These include internal governance, changing roles of state and central governments, commercialisation, ideas of ‘profiteering’ and judges’ moral commentaries on private institutions. Importantly, they suggest that poorly thought-out legal judgements have added to the woes of the sector. External governance also concerns Pankaj Chandra’s contribution on relationships between the university and the state. He puts forward specific reasons for the inadequacy of the existing governance mechanisms within universities as well as suggestions for re-designing relations between academia and the state for delivering better outcomes. In many ways, this collection marks a departure on the topic in as much as it engages with the issue of making higher education accountable to the needs of the majority, and, offers concrete suggestions for repairing a broken system. I suspect that many of the perspectives will not be popular with those concerned with the existing public university system. Notwithstanding that, that creature certainly requires serious scrutiny.

Pack right before travelling during monsoon season,"Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for nigh t time. (Source: File Photo) Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for nigh t time. (Source: File Photo)

Before going on a trip during the rainy season, it is important to carry the right tools and instruments to save your belongings like cellphone and wallet from drenching. Carry zip lock bags, umbrellas, mosquito repellents and waterproof backpacks, suggest experts.

Narayana Menon K, co-founder at Wandertrails, an online platform enabling discovery and booking of experiences, has listed a few necessary items:

* Arm yourself with an umbrella or raincoat. A waterproof backpack is a must-have.

* Always carry a zip lock bag. It is good to keep the wallet and other expensive belongings safe as well like the smartphone and maybe other equipments like camera and lenses.

* It is the season when mosquito-borne diseases are rampant with stagnant puddles and blocked drains everywhere. Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for night time.

* It is best to carry own water, otherwise, drink only boiled water. The same goes for food, don’t eat from just anywhere. Street food is extremely difficult to say not to, at least make sure it is covered.

* Carry light synthetic clothes that will dry easily.

* Floaters and sandals are the best options in terms of footwear.

Inputs from Aloke Bajpai, CEO at ixigo, travel search engine:

* Having street food during the rainy season can be very unhygienic. Carry sachets of herbal teas and packaged food. Also, don’t drink water from unsealed bottles or the regular running tap.

* Always carry a first-aid box in case of an emergency. The probability of catching cold and falling sick during the rainy season is more than during any other time of the year.

* If planning to visit a new destination, always know how you can get help if stranded – the intensity of rain that the region receives, and emergency contact information of the local authorities. It is advisable to make reservations beforehand to ensure a safe journey.

* Chances of a power outage during a rainy day are more as compared to normal days. To keep phone active, it’s important to carry a power bank all the time.

* As it might get dark early, keep a flashlight. Don’t rely on the phone’s flashlight.

* It’s good to carry some extra plastic bags to keep electronics safe. They can also be used to keep wet clothes and food items.

Speaking ahead of the opening of the World Athletics championships in London, Sebastian Coe said that athletes needed to have a strong connection to the country they are representing, rather than looking around for nations to run for.

“We have witnessed in the last few years the changing shape of our sport which at its best is a championship-based sport (where) the best athletes competing against each other with national identity,” he said on Friday.

“I can’t have a situation where I’ve got federation presidents reporting to me that most mornings they are waking up to emails with names of athletes looking for flags of convenience.”

Unlike other sports such as soccer, athletics has allowed its competitors to switch nationalities, even after they have represented one country at international level.

Several dozen athletes changed allegiance on the eve of last year’s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.

In February this year, the IAAF placed an immediate stop on changes of nationality by athletes and has set up a working group to come up with new rules.

Coe said although there should be some “legitimate and genuine” chances for athletes to switch, he wanted the process to be “a lot tougher”.

“It can’t be done on the basis that just two federations agree and an athlete suddenly appears in a completely different uniform to the one they were running in six weeks ago,” he added.

"Southeast Asia issues strong rebuke, warning to North Korea","The ASEAN ministers reiterated in a joint statement their grave concerns over the escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula due to the North’s two ICBM tests last month, saying the launches threaten world stability. (Reuters/File) The ASEAN ministers reiterated in a joint statement their grave concerns over the escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula due to the North’s two ICBM tests last month, saying the launches threaten world stability. (Reuters/File)

Southeast Asia’s top diplomats slammed North Korea with a sharp rebuke today over its intercontinental ballistic missile tests and admonished Pyongyang to comply with its duty of helping avert conflicts as a member of Asia’s biggest security forum. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations foreign ministers, however, were split on an American proposal to suspend Pyongyang from the ASEAN Regional Forum, a 27-nation bloc that includes North Korea and its bitter adversaries the US, South Korea and Japan.

The ASEAN ministers reiterated in a joint statement their grave concerns over the escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula due to the North’s two ICBM tests last month, saying the launches threaten world stability. The ministers traditionally issue a communique containing their diverse concerns, and their issuance of a separate statement on North Korea’s missile tests and nuclear weapons program reflects their deep worries about the issue. “These developments seriously threaten peace, security and stability in the region and the world,” the ministers said in their statement.

They urged the North to immediately and fully comply with its obligations under UN Security Council resolutions. They also backed efforts to improve relations between the two Koreas and said their 10-nation bloc was ready “to play a constructive role in contributing to peace and stability” on the Korean Peninsula. Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said the ministers were divided over a US proposal to suspend the North from the ASEAN Regional Forum, which will hold its annual meeting on Monday.

North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho will attend Monday’s meeting. With the US, Japan and South Korea expected to push for stronger actions against the North, a verbal showdown looms at the Manila forum. “There were views that, ‘How can we hear them out or confront them if they’re not there?’ But there’s also a view that we should give them an ultimatum,” Cayetano said late yesterday after discussing the issue with other foreign ministers.

The ministers “strongly call upon” North Korea, as a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum, to help “maintain the Asia Pacific as a region of lasting peace, stability, friendship and prosperity,” the ministers said in their statement.

"Australia name Mitchell Swepson, Jackson Bird in 14-man Test squad for Bangladesh tour","Mitchell Swepson is the third front-line spinner in the side. Mitchell Swepson is the third front-line spinner in the side.

Australia had to make a change to their earlier announced Test squad for Bangladesh after James Pattinson was ruled out due to inflammation in his back. Cricket Australia confirmed on Saturday that Jackson Bird will replace the pacer in the squad.

The news came shortly after Australia announced Mitchell Swepson of Queensland as the replacement to injured fast bowler Mitchell Starc.

Thinking of the Ashes series against England later this year, Cricket Australia decided to replace Pattinson after he complained of inflammation around the same area he suffered a stress fracture though the board said it was not another stress fracture.

Swepson, who had made it to the squad for the India tour, will be the third spinner in the squad after Nathan Lyon and Ashton Agar. A pace bowler was expected to replace Starc but instead the spinner was selected.

“We are comfortable with the fast-bowling stocks we have in the squad so have opted to add an additional spinner given the conditions we are likely to face in Bangladesh,” selector Trevor Hohns said in an earlier statement.

“Mitchell is a very exciting young leg-spinner who we think will benefit immensely from further experience in the sub-continent.”

The two are replacements to the original squad that was announced in June and CA was hoping to find a replacement to Star, who suffered a stress fracture in his foot on India tour, through the Australia ‘A’ side’s South Africa tour. But, this was cancelled after players boycotted due to the pay dispute which was settled on Thursday.

Australia begin the tour with first Test from August 21 to 31 in Dhaka and the second beginning from September 4 in Chittagong.

Australia Test squad: Steve Smith (captain), David Warner, Ashton Agar, Jackson Bird, Hilton Cartwright, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Glenn Maxwell, James Pattinson, Matthew Renshaw, Mitchell Swepson, Matthew Wade.

Pro Kabaddi 2017: U Mumba outclass Dabang Delhi 36-22,"Mumbai ended the match 14 points ahead of Delhi. (Source: PKL) Mumbai ended the match 14 points ahead of Delhi. (Source: PKL)

Delhi’s R Sriram took two points in the second half and suddenly, U Mumba were down to one player. They had been on top of Dabang Delhi for a better part of the match but the latter had managed to chip away at Mumbai with some tight defending in the first few minutes of the second half. But that one player that remained for U Mumba was captain Anup Kumar. He had a discussion with the coach if they should just give up or no before deciding to go for the raid.

It was one against seven. Kumar got a touch before dodging another and reached the mid line flat on his back. A Delhi defender had also sidestepped which meant that U Mumba had got three points out of that raid and Kumar brought back two of his teammates. It was the only time in the match where U Mumba were close to being all out. They went on to win it 36-22.

Dabang Delhi took the first two points of the match. But after Shabeer Bapu picked up a bonus point for U Mumba the tide turned. Mumbai took 4 points in the first five minutes and six more in the next three and the score became 10-2 in favour of U Mumba with about 12 minutes remaining in the half. Dabang Delhi were all out for the first time in the match at that point. Delhi finally got a point only after Nilesh Shinde brilliantly tackled an unsuspecting Kashiling Adake. Delhi then started putting an emphasis on their defensive efforts and it was working for them. At half time, the score was 14-8 in U Mumba’s favour.

Delhi shored up their defense in the first few minutes of the second half and got U Mumba on the verge of an all out. But then, Anup Kumar turned it around and the momentum shifted back to Mumbai. From then on, it was one step forward, two steps back for Delhi. Every time they looked like they were catching up, U Mumba made a two-point raid or a Super Tackle.

With four minutes remaining on the clock, Dabang Delhi were all out for a second time in the match. The score was 32-16 in favour of U Mumba at that point and it would have taken something of a miracle for Delhi to come back from there. That didn’t happen and Mumbai ended the match 14 points ahead of Delhi.

Wheelchair-bound man arrested with 250 gold bars in Bangladesh,"Representational Image/ File Representational Image/ File

A 48-year-old wheelchair-bound man has been arrested at an airport in Bangladesh while trying to smuggle 25 kg gold into the country, custom officials said, calling it the biggest haul of the year. Jamil Akter, a native of Nilphamari, flew to Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport here from Singapore yesterday. He had kept 250 gold bars worth 12.5 crore taka in a vest kept between his legs, Dhaka Tribune reported.

“Acting on a tip-off, our team confronted the man when he was crossing the green channel on a wheelchair, pretending to be unwell,” Dhaka Customs House Preventive Team Assistant Commissioner Ahsanul Kabir was quoted by the report. “He denied having any gold initially, but admitted to it later, during interrogation. We found 250 gold bars in a vest kept between his legs. The man has a chips shop in Singapore. He went in and out of the country 13 times in the last six months,” the customs official added.

Customs officials were preparing to hand over him to police after filing a criminal case. Another team found 6 kg gold abandoned in a flight of US-Bangla Airlines.

"Terriers, Seagulls and Magpies aim to surprise","Huddersfield Town, English champions three times in the 1920’s, were relegated from the old first division in 1972. (Source: Reuters) Huddersfield Town, English champions three times in the 1920’s, were relegated from the old first division in 1972. (Source: Reuters)

As relegated Hull City and Middlesbrough proved last season, surviving in the Premier League after winning promotion is no easy matter, but the three new arrivals in the top flight this season are determined to stay around.

Huddersfield Town and Brighton and Hove Albion are back in the elite after lengthy absences while Newcastle United are an established Premier League team who bounced back at the first attempt following relegation. Recent history suggests the odds are against promoted clubs.

Since the Premier League reduced its size to 20 teams in 1995, 47 percent of promoted clubs have been relegated in their first season and 60 percent have gone back down within two years.

But none of that has dampened the enthusiasm, particularly at Huddersfield, the Yorkshire “Terriers” back in the top flight after a 45 year absence.

Huddersfield, English champions three times in the 1920’s, were relegated from the old first division in 1972 and struggled in the lower divisions and bottom end of the Championship before being transformed by German coach David Wagner.

“We can feel the atmosphere in the town and we ourselves are excited but we have to be focused on our work,” said the former Borussia Dortmund assistant coach.

“I will never decelerate excitement though, it makes totally no sense, everybody should keep that excitement. It can help you to make the steps you can’t normally do,” he said.

Wagner has brought in nine new signings so far, tapping into his European contacts. He says they have settled in and is confident he can get them to gel into an effective unit in time.

“I think the good thing is that we have already a good base,” he told Reuters. “If you have a good dressing room it is easier for the other guys to settle in quick. This is what has happened. I know this is extraordinary.”

Brighton’s Chris Hughton is returning to the top division after managing Newcastle and Norwich City in the top tier. “We don’t have many (players) who have played in the Premier League but it is a wonderful step and a massive challenge. They know in most games we will be the underdogs. You are looking at your personalities to rise to that challenge,” he said.

The Seagulls last appeared in the top division in 1983 but Newcastle hope their more recent experience, big budget and 50,000 plus crowds, will ensure a smooth return.

Spanish manager Rafa Benitez, the former Liverpool and Real Madrid coach, has sold 18 players and signed 17 in the past year, and it would be no surprise to see more changes before the start of the season.

Benitez has been pushing for more investment but with expectations always high on Tyneside, he will need his side to hit the ground running.

Making the adjustment from the Championship, where Newcastle dominated possession, to the Premier League where they will often be on the back foot, is one area of work the Magpies have focused on.

“We’re going to come up against teams in the Premier League who are going to have a lot more possession than we have. It was different in the Championship where we were the team to go to,” said midfielder Jonjo Shelvey.

“We need to get used to not having the ball and being compact and narrow.”

More than 40 installations are to light up London in one of the biggest ever light shows, Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Thursday.

Streets, buildings and public spaces will be illuminated during the Lumiere London festival which is expected to attract millions of visitors to the British capital next January.

The event takes place between January 18 and 21 in what Khan says will be a chance for people across the world to see London in a new light.

More than 40 British and international artists will transform London and offer new perspectives on the capital’s iconic architecture, streets and landmarks.

Building on the phenomenal success of Lumiere London 2016, festival destinations will include King’s Cross, London’s West End, including Carnaby, Regent Street, Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, Mayfair, Piccadilly, St James’s, Fitzrovia and Westminster.

Works will be exhibited on both sides of the River Thames, with Covent Garden, Victoria, South Bank and Waterloo added as new destinations for 2018.

Mayor Khan said: “Lumiere London 2018 will be bigger, brighter and bolder than ever before, with even more areas of the city involved and even more people expected to visit this incredible festival.

“Lumiere London 2018 shows that London is open to people from across the world and open to creativity and ideas, and open for business. There’s no better way to banish the January blues — so get ready to take to the streets and marvel at a dazzling array of incredible artwork and installations.”

Lumiere London in 2016 attracted more than 1.3 million visitors to London at a time when the city is usually quiet following the Christmas break.

"Hurriyat leader targets PDP, questions internet blockades","Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. (Source: Express Photo/File) Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. (Source: Express Photo/File)

Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq on Saturday lashed out at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)-led state government over frequent internet blockades and closure of educational institutes to prevent protests. In a series of tweets, he questioned whether the blockades were going to solve the problem.

Farooq said the government had made a lot of noise last year about students suffering in view of closure of educational institutes. He added that the government “does not seem to be bothered” about the future of students as educational institutes are frequently closed.

He said that it was only in Kashmir where India uses “iron fist military approach” to deal with a “political problem”. Farooq has reached out to the media through social media since police foiled his press conference recently.

Afghan forces gain ground from Taliban in pattern of territory changing hands,"More than 2,500 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in the first four months of the year and UN figures show a 22 percent increase in security incidents across the country. (Source: Reuters) More than 2,500 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in the first four months of the year and UN figures show a 22 percent increase in security incidents across the country. (Source: Reuters)

Afghan security forces retook a district centre in the eastern province of Paktia on Friday, following a sequence of fighting with Taliban insurgents that has seen control over a series of strongpoints change hands in recent days. Paktia police chief Toryalai Abdiani said security forces took back control of Jani Khil district and killed dozens of Taliban fighters.

Jani Khil district centre, which sits on a major road from Pakistan into eastern Afghanistan, fell to the Taliban last month. The movement’s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, denied that it had lost control of the town.

Abdiani said the troops were advancing with caution because of risk of roadside bombs.

Also on Friday, Afghan forces battled Taliban fighters in Greshk district, one of the most heavily fought-over areas in the southern province of Helmand, where the

insurgents have control of nine of 14 districts, according to US figures.

Friday’s fighting, which followed an attack on a convoy near Kabul that killed a Georgian member of the NATO-led Resolute Support training and advisory mission, was a further illustration of the rising violence across Afghanistan this year.

More than 2,500 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in the first four months of the year and UN figures show a 22 percent increase in security incidents across the country in the first quarter of the year to the highest level since the United Nations started reporting a decade ago.

US commanders have declared the conflict to be stuck in stalemate, drifting between small unit engagements and high-profile attacks against civilian targets in the cities with neither side capable of securing lasting victory.

The US administration has been considering sending 4,000 more troops to Afghanistan but plans have been delayed by splits over the wider policy, with President Donald Trump reported to be sceptical about continuing with an open-ended commitment.

Switzerland is known for many things, from snow-capped mountains to Swiss chocolates, there is no dearth of reasons why one must visit the magical place. And to top that, it has now officially opened the world’s ‘longest’ suspension bridge. The 494m-long pedestrian hanging bridge is perfect for hikers and for wanderers who love to explore nature at its best. But, it is not for the faint-hearted. The adventurous walk down the ‘Europabruecke’ bridge, connecting Grächen and Zermatt, is at a “dizzying height”, according to the Zermatt tourism board website.

The bridge is located along the Europaweg trail offers views of the Matterhorn, Weisshorn and the Bernese Alps mountains. The bridge will also provide an opportunity for travellers to witness the highest mountains in Switzerland the Dom (4,545m).

However, along with breathtaking view, it could literally take away the breath of people with vertigo. “The path runs between 1,600m and 2,200m above sea level and high above the deepest cut valley in Switzerland,” the tourism board added.

The bridge is situated on the Europaweg that connects the villages of Zermatt and Graechen. (Source: Keystone via AP) The bridge is situated on the Europaweg that connects the villages of Zermatt and Graechen. (Source: Keystone via AP)

A 405m bridge in Reutte, Austria hangs 110m higher. Not to forget the deadly glass-bottom bridges in China’s Guizhou province.

Independence-Day speech: Govt readies report card on promises PM Modi made last year,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Source: Reuters/File) Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Source: Reuters/File)

In preparation for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech from the ramparts of Red Fort on Independence Day, the government has prepared a report card on the status of promises he made in his speech last year. It has also written to the ministries concerned, seeking responses on any recent update that may have been left out.

After a detailed analysis of the speech, eight specific promises have been identified for the report card. These pertain to the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, energy-rich India, farmers’ welfare, healthy India, saluting freedom fighters and saluting tribals and giving an identity to every Indian.

Interestingly, the report card says that no status update is available with the Press Information Bureau on the promise of giving an identity to every Indian.

On Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), which is also among the 70 schemes to be showcased to mark 70 years of independence, the report card says that the pace of construction of rural roads reached a seven-year high of 130 km per day in 2016-17 as compared to 73 km in 2011-2014.

In the present financial year 2017-18, the target is to construct 57,000 km of roads under PMGSY, at an average per day rate of 156 km, connecting 16,600 habitations, according to the tabulated worksheet.

On Modi’s commitment to an energy rich India — he had made special mention of solar energy — the document says: “Total solar capacity as on 30.06.2017 is 13114.59 mw (*This is a quantum jump from Solar Power installed capacity of 3,743 MW in 2014-15).”

On farmers’ welfare, an issue on which the government has been facing heat, the report card mentions a new central sector scheme called Kisan Sampada Yojana approved in May with a Rs 6,000-crore outlay, 236 integrated cold chain projects in the works and a special fund of Rs 2,000 crore in NABARD to make credit available to designated food parks and agro-processing units.

The report card notes that that the promise of increasing freedom fighters’ pension to Rs 30,000 per month from Rs 25,000 has been fulfilled by the Home Ministry through an order that sanctioned the monthly sum for ex-Andaman political prisoners or their spouses. Modi’s emphasis on online medical records in last year’s speech was followed by financial assistance to 16 states and Union Territories under National Health Mission for creation of online medical records, says the report card.

The most detailed update has been drawn up on the promise of “saluting tribals” with the Tribal Affairs Ministry having received four proposals from Gujarat, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh to set up parks and museums and showcase tribal movements.

Australia’s top players have voted to endorse the new pay deal, the Australian Cricketers’ Association said on Friday as the dust settled on a bruising 10-month dispute that opened up deep fault lines in the country’s favourite sport.

Cricket Australia and the players’ union announced they had agreed an “in principle” deal on Thursday, finally ending the month-long lockout that threatened a tour of Bangladesh and this year’s Ashes series.

The vote by the players was no more than a formality but union boss Alistair Nicholson confirmed it had taken place and been “overwhelmingly” in favour of the heads of agreement that will form the basis of a new five-year pay deal.

“Thanks to the fans for their patience throughout this negotiation,” he added on Twitter. “Players looking forward to getting back to playing cricket.”

Reaction to the deal in the Australian media was equally overwhelming in its assessment that the players had “won” the dispute after the retention of the revenue share element of the deal that Cricket Australia had been determined to get rid of.

“Cricket bosses yield to player power,” read the headline on the back page of The Australian newspaper, while inside cricket commentator Peter Lalor said the governing body had questions to answer.

“Cricket Australia went to war with its most valuable asset because, it claimed, the revenue-share model was outdated and made administration of its business too difficult,” he wrote.

“CA has at best achieved a little tinkering around the edges of revenue share … as somebody said early this week, that much could have been agreed to over a beer.”

The players and the board had underestimated each other, Greg Baum in Melbourne’s The Age suggested.

“It is pretty clear that CA thought the players would cave in once they were not being paid,” he wrote.

“But it is also clear that the players expected CA to soften in its hard line once commercial realities began to pinch.

“Meantime, trust and respect went by the wayside, and so did an “A” tour to South Africa.”

The players, meanwhile, celebrated the solidarity of the 230 or so male and female professionals who went unpaid for a month until the conclusion of the dispute.

“It makes me so proud of this current generation of Australian cricketers who have stood united to preserve what the cricketers of yesteryear fought so hard to attain,” former test all-rounder Shane Watson, who is on the ACA executive, wrote on Twitter.

Australia captain Steve Smith, who will now lead the test squad on the tour of Bangladesh later this month, added a conciliatory note. “I’d like to thank the ACA for negotiating on behalf of the players and I’m excited that we can all start working together again to continue to grow our great game,” he wrote on Twitter.

“I look forward to Bangladesh, India and an exciting summer of Ashes cricket.”

"Alia Bhatt exercise, workout, training and diet plan","Alia Bhatt is very particular when it comes to her workout routine and diet plan. (Source: Instagram/aliabhatt) Alia Bhatt is very particular when it comes to her workout routine and diet plan. (Source: Instagram/aliabhatt)

If you’re looking for celeb fitness inspiration then Alia Bhatt’s workout routine might make you want to hit the gym. She is no slouch when it comes to her performances on-screen and definitely not one when it comes to staying fit. The Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya actor has worked really hard to get the toned body she has today with the help of celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala. According to reports, she weighed around 67kg when she was 17 and lost around 16kg in just three months when she was shortlisted for her debut film Student of the Year.

Today, all of 24, the actress can often be seen sharing inspirational workout videos with her followers on Instagram, documenting her journey in a way. From working out on the Pilates machine Cadillac to the extremely difficult back-bend bridge, handstand, crunches and Jack Rabbit, she does it all. This beauty doesn’t like repeating workouts, so Karachiwala has her hitting different machines like the corealign, reformer, Wunda chair, step barrel and the Bodhi suspension system.

As far as her diet is concerned, she has a major sweet tooth and is a fan of Pooja Dhingra’s Le 15 Patisserie and Chef Kelvin Cheung’s delectable cakes, but she is also a stickler for discipline and probably that’s what helps her the most.

Bhatt also believes in eating everything in moderation. Recently, she teamed up with celebrity dietician Rujuta Diwekar for a Facebook live session, in which she talked about her body secrets. Shattering the concept of following the online food trends, she said, “Everyone’s talking about gluten-free pizza, brown bread, and red rice, about reducing their carb intake, and I’m eating white bread and butter at 4am. Rujuta showed me how local food eaten in moderation can be healthy.”

In the past, she has even shared photos of her enjoying bread on Instagram, which is a no-no for fitness freaks. “Who knew a piece of malt bread with avocado, tomatoes and a poached egg would make me so happy?,” she wrote.

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis addressed the second batch of the CM Fellowship Programme Saturday and had an interaction with the students who had worked with the government for the last one year. “Every new policy or idea at its initial stages meets resistance from various quarters. But once the process sets in and people are convinced about its impact in their daily lives, it is accepted. Whether is it cashless transactions or digitisation to bring e-governance, they are bound to find some resistance but will become part of the process,” he said.

The state government has started the CM Fellowship Programme two years ago under which a batch of 35 to 45 young professionals from various fields are selected to intern with the state administration on various key projects and policies. They include students from IIT, business management institutes and those from medicine and humanities streams.

The government is receptive to incorporate new ideas and knowledge shared by the young minds for good governance, said the CM. During the interaction, the students shared their experience working with different departments and made presentation on subjects ranging from DigiDhan, start-ups, IT sector, rainwater harvest, solar energy, environment and climate change.

"Dubai The Marina Torch fire: Tower ablaze again, rescue operations underway","Fire is engulfing a high-rise residential tower in Dubai in the middle of the night, sending plumes of smoke into the air and debris falling below. (Source: Twitter/Daliakaki) Fire is engulfing a high-rise residential tower in Dubai in the middle of the night, sending plumes of smoke into the air and debris falling below. (Source: Twitter/Daliakaki)

A massive fire broke at the 74-story Torch tower in Dubai early Friday. Occupants were immediately asked to flee their homes as firefighters battled a blaze through one of the world’s tallest buildings in Dubai. Burning debris was showering down the sides of the tower when the firefighting squad arrived, reported Reuters quoting Dubai Civil defence authorities. The 1,105 foot tall torch tower was cooled down around at 4:00 am (0000 GMT). The tower was evacuated and no injuries were reported, authorities said.

The tower in Dubai’s Marina district caught fire for the second time since February 2015. The police had sealed surrounding streets ensuring safety of the people around. According Reuteres wintness, there was no signs of fire on the exterior of tower. “We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming. We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor,” a resident who gave his name as George, said “The fire was very strong at that time, about 1 a.m. Then it started calming down over the next two hours. It started on the 67th floor, that’s what we were told,” he added.

Another resident, whose name was Mohammed and lives on the 12th floor, said the top part caught fire first and then lower levels followed as debris fell.

With end of pay dispute it is time to play some good cricket: Darren Lehmann,"Darren Lehmann is looking forward to the tour of Bangladesh. (Source: Photo Express) Darren Lehmann is looking forward to the tour of Bangladesh. (Source: Photo Express)

Stating that the bitter pay dispute will be a thing of the past Australian coach, Darren Lehmann is eager to return to action and get his team on the field.

“Now the deal is done, it’s a case of us making sure we’re in the best possible place to play some really good cricket,” Lehmann said.

While speaking at the Dead Set Legends show he added, “The boys have all still been training while they were off contract, so we’re not behind the times as such.”

With the addition of new faces the Aussie side looks a like nice blend of experience of youth. Lehmann agreed and said that it was really pleasing from a coaching point of view. “That’s the really pleasing thing from a coach’s point of view. “A few (of the Australia squad players) have been in Brisbane for the last few weeks, or training with their state systems. That’s been really good for the young state guys to see the Australian boys train so that’s been a plus.

“Now we go to Darwin next week and they’re obviously great conditions for us leading into Bangladesh.”

On the addition of Mitchell Swepson, he said, “We think it’s going to turn, obviously, so an extra spinner there,” Lehmann said. “If we only play two quicks, we’ve still got an extra quick there as well. “We’ve got plenty of options. It gives us a really good squad going into that tour.”

"In a shift, Qatar to offer permanent residency to some non-citizens","The residency permit gives holders similar rights as Qataris in terms of property ownership and access to generous education and health care services. (Source: Reuters) The residency permit gives holders similar rights as Qataris in terms of property ownership and access to generous education and health care services. (Source: Reuters)

Qatar’s Cabinet has approved a draft law making permanent residency available to some non-citizens, marking a partial shift from its reliance on its longstanding visa-sponsorship system. The energy-rich Gulf nation said in a statement sent on Thursday that the residency permits could be granted to children of Qatari women married to foreigners, people who “offered valuable services to the country” and those with special skills. As in many Arab countries, a Qatari child’s citizenship is granted based on the father’s nationality.

The residency permit gives holders similar rights as Qataris in terms of property ownership and access to generous education and health care services. Qatar’s native population is far surpassed by foreigners holding fixed-term residency permits typically tied to a sponsoring employer.

US to introduce points-based system for those seeking Green Card,"Donald Trump announced a 0 million investment in pharmaceuticals manufacturing industry (Source: AP) Donald Trump announced a 0 million investment in pharmaceuticals manufacturing industry (Source: AP)

The Donald Trump administration is set to introduce a new points-based system for those seeking Green Card. The system will favour English-speaking skilled workers and “discourage” others will low skills, the White House said.

This comes as day after Trump declared his support for a legislation that propose to cut down on the number of legal immigrants allowed to enter the US.

Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the president, told reporters at the White House: “The Trump administration has also proposed to limit family-based migration to spouses and minor children.”

This system will be a lot similar to the one in place in Canada and Australia, he said.

Trump had mentioned about the points-based system in his State of the Union address early this year. The points-based system, Miller said, will look at whether the applicant speaks English besides some other factors.

“Can they support themselves and their families financially? Do they have a skill that will add to the US economy? Are they being paid a high wage?” he asked, adding that the proposed system will help prevent displacement of US workers.

With this, Trump has fulfilled a major campaign promise towards a merit-based immigration reform that protects US workers, protects US taxpayers, and protects the US economy, and that prioritises the needs of its own citizens, residents and workers, Miller said.

“It’s pro-American immigration reform that the American people want, that the American people deserve, and that puts the needs of the working class ahead of the investor class,” he said.

The proposal was formally announced by Trump along with two Senators — Tom Cotton and David Perdue –- who are the authors of the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act.

The bill needs to be signed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, before it can be sent to the White House for Trump to sign it into law.

“The RAISE Act will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. It will do this by changing the way the United States issues Green Cards to nationals from other countries. Green Cards provide permanent residency, work authorisation, and a fast-track to citizenship,” Trump had said at a White House event to announce his support to the RAISE Act.

Miller claimed massive public support for this. “Ultimately, members of the Congress will have a choice to make. They can either vote with the interests of US citizens and US workers, or they can vote against their interests, and whatever happens as a result of that, I think, would be somewhat predictable,” he said.

Miller described the development as “a really historic moment” and the biggest proposed change that would take place in 50 years. However, political opponents describe the RAISE Act as anti-immigrant.

“Our nation’s immigrants are the constant reinvigoration of America. By bringing their hopes, courage and determination to succeed to our shores, each generation of newcomers makes America more American,” said Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

“From the start, Trump has pushed a hateful, senseless anti-immigrant agenda that instills fear in the communities, weakens the nation, and dishonours American values,” Pelosi said.

The Democratic Party said that the bill would limit Green Cards for those looking to reunite with their US-based families and cut the number of accepted refugees in half. It would also prioritise awarding green cards to those who speak English and end the visa diversity lottery for individuals from areas that have fewer immigrants in the US, it claimed.

"I don’t like the word diet, says fitness expert Yasmin Karachiwala","” I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.” ” I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.”

Celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala, who has trained the likes of Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt and Katrina Kaif, says she doesn’t like the word “diet”.

“I don’t like the word diet. I think we all are smart and making smart food choices is a lifestyle change. I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them,” Karachiwala told IANS over e-mail. The celebrated fitness trainer, who has been roped in as the official fitness expert for sports and lifestyle brand Skechers, added: “I don’t recommend any diet”. Along with being a popular name in the fitness sector, Karachiwala, who owns a gym — Body Image in the suburbs of Mumbai, is also the first BASI certified Pilates instructor in India and established the first Pilates studio.

Pilates is a system of exercises using special apparatus, designed to improve physical strength, flexibility and posture, and enhance mental awareness. Asked how Pilates is more beneficial than other forms of exercise, Karachiwala said: “Pilates helps strengthen the core and works the body from the inside out. It helps prevent injuries. I suggest doing it along with any other exercise and see how it makes you perform that exercise even better.”

Being in the fitness industry for over two decades, Karachiwala has helped Bollywood big-wigs like Deepika, Katrina, Alia, Sonakshi Sinha, Malaika Arora Khan, Zareen Khan and more to achieve the perfect frame.

What’s the biggest challenge she faces while training a Bollywood personality?

“I think to achieve different looks for a specific role is always a good challenge as if giving us an end goal. Challenges are good as it keeps you and your client motivated,” she said. Asked with whose transformation she was really proud of, Karachiwala replied: “All my clients work extremely hard. It’s not easy with their schedules but they are all dedicated to their workouts and I’m proud of them.”

It is often said that Bollywood personalities take supplements to modify their body according to their roles in films. What do you have to say to that? Karachiwala replied: “I don’t believe in supplements as such I think naturally. If we eat healthy, our body can get most of its nutrients. Of course, sometimes vegetarians have a problem with protein so then a plant based protein shake is what I would suggest.”

She’s funny that way: How did Aditi Mittal become India’s most popular female stand-up comic?,"She’s got to say what she’s got to say: Mittal in Things They Wouldn’t Let Me Say on Netflix. She’s got to say what she’s got to say: Mittal in Things They Wouldn’t Let Me Say on Netflix.

There’s a technique to the slap,” says Aditi Mittal, turning in her chair so that she can demonstrate the physics of an on-screen slap. It’s almost like a magic trick, sound and action must be in sync, but most importantly, it’s got to look real. “I know these things because I got slapped by a cop once on CID,” she says, flipping her colourful hair back in slo-mo. Was it the all-knowing ACP Pradhyuman? “No, it was a female cop. I played one half of the college basketball team captains, Jinny and Johnny, who were accused of murdering Natasha, by electrocuting her on a basketball hoop, when she went in for the final slam dunk,” says Mittal, her fake smugness wiped off by a series of helpless chuckles.

Dressed in a vibrant multicoloured striped dress, Mittal, 31, is gearing up for a long day of press interviews at the Four Seasons hotel in Worli, Mumbai. In about two weeks, her hour-long comedy special, Things They Wouldn’t Let Me Say, will debut on Netflix, making her the first Indian comedienne, and the second Indian comic after Vir Das’s Abroad Understanding, to have their own show on the international online streaming platform. Mittal is brimming with excitement, but is quick to interject when any talk of “making it big” comes up in the conversation. “I think my breakthrough will come when I’ll be able to be consistent — when I’m able to produce a second, third or fourth show, and demonstrate growth in it. I’m a product of being in the right place, at the right time, and working in a certain direction, in a certain way. I don’t ever want to feel like I’ve arrived. I’ve seen this happen to people where they stop growing because they think the smell of their farts is delicious,” she says.

Mittal is keeping it real, but it’s only because comedy wasn’t even on the radar of things she wanted to do. Seven years ago, the girl from Mahim had dreamt of performing for an audience — just not a live one.

If things had gone according to plan, Mittal, arguably India’s most recognisable female comic, would have liked to have wrapped herself in a blingy sari, apply frosted lipstick and a triangle-shaped sindoor on her forehead. Night after night, her face would have appeared on our TV screens at dinner time, not once but in three quick close-ups — zoom, zoom, zoom! In 2009, Mittal, then 25, had just returned to India after graduating from Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, USA, with degrees in Mass Communication and Theatre; and she promptly joined thousands of other aspiring actors in the merry-go-round that is the audition cycle in Mumbai.

“I used to wake up at 8 am, apply makeup, reach the first audition at 10, and stand in line for two-three hours to get a chance to be ‘the chick at the back of the bike’ for a battery advertisement. Or, for a soap that wanted to promote ‘natural beauty’. I’d sit there for six hours and then they’d pick three people who were six feet tall with perfect skin,” says Mittal, who auditioned everywhere she could for 18 months and only got a part in CID because her mother was the executive producer of the show.

The months after graduating from Fairleigh had been difficult. “I got a job after I graduated but thanks to the recession, I lost it quickly as well. I returned to Bombay and wasn’t getting any work in showbiz. That’s when comedy happened to me,” says Mittal. It was no incredible discovery, though, she’d always known she had a sense of humour, obviously inherited from her grandmother and mother. “I’ve been raised in a half Punjabi-half Sindhi home where the women were outspoken and sharp. I’m the younger child, I hear that’s a symptom too. I went to a girls’ boarding school in Pune, and we did cool things like start a band called the Cool Cats, even though we were awful. So, the ‘funny female’ is my narrative, and has always been,” she says.

Back in 2010, the comedy scene in Delhi and Mumbai was nascent, with only a handful of organisers such as the Bombay Elektrik Projekt (BEP), comedian and actor Vir Das, and the Cheese Monkey Mafia promoting new talent. “It was a very different time. There were no regular open mics, so I started with screenings of Def Comedy Jam (an American stand-up comedy series) to give people an idea of what stand-up was about,” says Sudeip Nair, founder, BEP. Nair later started The Hive and now runs The Cuckoo Club, a performing space in Bandra, and a popular open mic venue.

To combat the dreariness of auditioning for roles she’d never be cast in, Mittal began to frequent open mic events. “The first set I ever did was for Vir Das’s ‘Hamateur Nights’ in 2010. I cracked jokes about how Punjabi my father is. I was terrible, but I’m grateful to places like BEP because they offered a consistent platform. I kept working on my material and going back every other week to perform,” says Mittal. She joined fellow comics like Rohan Joshi, Tanmay Bhatt, Varun Thakur, Sahil Bulla, Sapan Verma and improv artiste Kaneez Surka who cut their teeth at open mic events, before taking their craft to Twitter, YouTube, and live shows.

“When I started doing comedy, I had elevated ideas about what it was all about — truth, and that comics must not misuse their power, be cruel and hurt those who are disenfranchised,” says Mittal, putting on a quasi-British accent for effect. She shakes her head and says, “But I see it happening in comedy all the time. So, I wanted to talk about things that are disturbing to me.”

If, to quote American humourist Mary Hirsch, “humour is a rubber sword — it allows you to make a point without drawing blood”, then does it matter who wields it? As Mittal and her fellow comediennes would find out, it sure does. “The Indian audience is not always prepared to hear from women. For example, they’ll need no encouragement to laugh about sex, but there’s a double standard involved when a woman cracks the joke,” says Neeti Palta, a Delhi-based comedienne who isn’t afraid to joke about how female foeticide has made standing in a women’s only line easier. “What sets Aditi apart is that she’s such a performer, she’s impossible to ignore. Confidence gets respected on stage, and Aditi has loads of it,” she says.

A funny woman is a dangerous thing — more dangerous than a woman who speaks her mind — because laughing with her somehow makes one complicit in the wrongs she’s taking a jab at. From Sarah Silverman to Ali Wong to Amy Schumer in the US, to Mittal, Palta, and Radhika Vaz (one of the first women to do stand-up in the subcontinent) in India, female comics spare no one — not even themselves. “One of the early sets I used to do was about how fat I am, and how there is no euphemism for fat girls, as opposed to fat boys who get called ‘teddy bear’. Sometimes, people don’t even allude to his size and just say that he’s got a ‘heart of gold’. They don’t say that for women, do they?” says Mittal. In her live shows, while she may begin with low-hanging fruits such as community differences and the battle of the sexes, Mittal’s jokes include segments on musical eve teasing on the streets, sanitary pads, gender discrimination in the advertising industry, products such as vaginal tightening creams.

Sometimes, Mittal uses comedy to highlight sombre issues as well. The transition is well-executed and the original joke remains undiluted by the serious turn it has taken.

In Things They Wouldn’t Let Me Say, she combines the best of her work over the past few years in an hour-long feature. “I’d been in talks with Netflix for a year and in December, the deal came through. I’ve compiled a bunch of old jokes and pepped them up in the show. That was the best part of Netflix: they didn’t make demands on me. I have slaved my ass off for so long and I didn’t want to have to do things just to prove that I can do this,” says Mittal.

Stand-up is storytelling live, and on stage, Mittal is funny, charming, energetic and bold. She jumps from topic to topic, and is one of the few women to display a natural ability for physical comedy. Not all her jokes have a punchline — Mittal often uses her face to make a comical expression, signalling the end of a joke — but the take-home is almost always the subtext: in a man’s world, if a woman must work twice as hard for everything, the only way she can survive is by laughing twice as louder.

Her themes are not unique to Mittal; most comediennes in India take on the patriarchy, exposing the inherent sexism and misogyny in Indian culture. In a conversation with Daniel Fernandes on his comedy podcast You Started It, Mittal says, “I’m more often a ‘bitch’ when I’m being sarcastic, than a fellow dude comic who gets ‘Arre, kya joke maara, kya insightful, incisive’…Hello, where’s my ‘insightful, incisive’?”

Sometimes, Mittal uses comedy to highlight sombre issues as well. In one of her recent sets, she talks about bra shopping in India — an embarrassing experience that almost always involves a man called Chhotu scientifically measuring cup sizes with a single look; or going to a high-end store to buy a brand called Enchanté, which, as Mittal says, “is pronounced three thousand rupees”. Towards the end, she talks about breast cancer awareness — the transition is well-executed and effortless, and the original joke remains undiluted by the serious turn the conversation has taken.

Mittal has previously spoken about how, given the skewed ratio of male comics to female comics, a brotherhood has emerged in the Indian stand-up landscape, leaving women comics to work in spaces that don’t necessarily invest in them. “After seven years of performing consistently and making a living off it, I don’t care. It’s only in the last year or so, I’ve been able to make some money from comedy and pay rent, bills and have savings. Doing comedy or the Netflix show is not a ‘eff you’ to anybody — I’m just living my life,” says Mittal.

It is a stormy night, but all the seats at the Independence Brewing Company in Andheri West are taken. On the day Things They Wouldn’t Let Me Say premieres on Netflix, Mittal performs a trial run of Global Village Idiot, a brand new show written for her debut performance at the 2017 Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland. She will be on stage for 26 nights in August, before heading to London for a few shows in October.

Armed with a red binder, Mittal cautions the audience that this is a work in progress and they’re free to leave when they want. “I wrote ‘Trial’ for a reason, this set is for the goras, okay,” she says. There’s an easy vibe in the room, as Mittal begins. Some of the jokes work, others don’t quite hit the spot; Mittal quickly makes notes in her binder. The whole event acts as a group effort between the comedienne and her audience to make sure our desi girl puts her best foot forward at the Fringe.

Sadly, it won’t be possible for Dr Mrs Lutchuke to make the trip to Blighty —Mittal’s alter-ego of a slightly hunchbacked, middle-aged “psychologist-sexologist-fekulogist” who offers sex education is far too Indian for the West. “Lutchuke is a combination of my first Marathi teacher and my best friend’s grandmother. By giving her an accent and dressing her up in a sari, I can create a distance between myself and the character,” says Mittal, who wanted to joke about sex but was very uncomfortable when she started out. “There are older women everywhere who command more respect and have more authority. So, I was very drawn to playing an older woman,” says Mittal. Lutchuke’s side-splitting advice include telling men not to stress about the direction their penis points at because “it has to go into one place only”; or how being touched by a man does not make another man gay because “beta, if you touch the biryani, do you become the biryani?”

“Somebody recently asked me why I’m talking about ‘bold’ things. Comedy is a potent weapon, so shouldn’t we be using it to talk about potent things as well?” says Mittal. So, is there any subject that is untouchable for a comic? “I don’t think so,” says Mittal. What about rape jokes, since they are a known taboo in comedy? “You have to examine a joke in the context that it is cracked, because 90 per cent of the joke is context. When you talk about people who talk about what women should wear in order to avoid rape, or somebody saying that chowmein is an aphrodisiac, then you’re punching up. At the end of the day, it is still a rape joke, but who is the target now?” says Mittal.

The early reviews of her Netflix show have been trickling in as we chat. Some of the responses praise her “flair for self-deprecating humour”; others rue the lack of new material. “If the reviewers have seen my shows before, that’s fine. This is my first Netflix show and I put the best of my material out there, that was my aim. I’m not averse to criticism. I want to entertain people, but comedy has represented too many wonderful things to me for the criticism to constantly matter. I don’t care so much about having the last laugh, you know? I just want to start a conversation,” she says.

US Senate confirms three Indian-Americans to key US government positions,"U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik/Files) U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik/Files)

The Senate has unanimously confirmed three Indian-Americans to key government positions, including one as the Trump administration’s czar on intellectual property – an area of sharp differences between the US and India. The Senate confirmed Neil Chaterjee as a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Vishal Amin as Intellectual Property (IP) Enforcement Coordinator in the Trump administration. Krishna Urs was confirmed as the US ambassador to Peru.

A career foreign service officer since 1986, Urs – after Nikki Haley – is the second Indian-American to have been selected for an ambassadorial position by the administration. A two-term former governor of South Carolina, she is the US ambassador to the United Nations and holds a cabinet-level position in the administration. She is the first Indian-American to do so in any US presidential administration.

As the new IP Czar, Amin would be responsible for enforcement of intellectual property, an area of sharp differences between India and the United States. The US today retained India on its priority watch list this year for “lack of improvement” in the intellectual property (IP) framework.

In April, the US retained India on its priority watch list for “lack of improvement” in the IP framework. However, India had termed the report as an unilateral move by the US. Amin is currently the senior counsel on the House Judiciary Committee. “Vishal Amin has been a valued member of my staff and will continue to be a tireless advocate on behalf of America’s innovators and creators,” said Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

He has previously served in the administration of President George W Bush as associate director for Domestic Policy, and at the Department of Commerce as special assistant and associate director for policy in the Office of the Secretary, the White House said.

Chatterjee, currently the energy policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, over the years has played an integral role in the passage of major energy, highway, and farm legislations. “Chatterjee has an extensive knowledge of the many important federal issues facing our industry and customers,” said Edison Electric Institute (EEI) President Tom Kuhn.

Prior to serving McConnell, he worked as a principal in Government Relations for National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.

Urs is currently charge d’affaires of the US Embassy in Madrid, Spain, where he was also the deputy chief of mission. Urs has specialised in economic issues and developed extensive policy experience in the Andean region of South America. He has served at seven United States embassies as well in senior leadership positions in Washington, DC.

Adele hosts Despicable Me 3 screening for Grenfell Tower blaze victims,"Adele hosted a private movie screening for the children affected by the Grenfell Tower blaze. Adele hosted a private movie screening for the children affected by the Grenfell Tower blaze.

Singer Adele hosted a private movie screening for the children affected by the Grenfell Tower blaze to cheer them up. The 29-year-old singer treated the young victims of the devastating incident, which killed around 80 people when the fire engulfed the building in west London in June this year, to a viewing of Universal Pictures’ Despicable Me 3 at London’s Whiteley’s cinema on Thursday, reported E! online.

The “Hello” hit maker also invited real-life Minions to meet and greet the kids to help distract them from thinking about the disaster. The musician was believed to be more than happy to pose for pictures with her young guests. Adele’s screening is not the first time she has shown her support for the victims of the blaze. Shortly after the fire broke out, she visited the site, and later met with the firefighters, who battled tough conditions to save as many people as they could, at Chelsea Fire Station. The singer – who has four-year-old son Angelo with her partner Simon Konecki – has even called for donations to be made to the Grenfell Tower victims during her recent concert at London’s Wembley Stadium.

Adele had recently cancelled her Wembley, London shows after she had damaged her vocal cords. Those were the final two shows of her world tour. Adele won the Academy Award in the Best Original Song for her song ‘Skyfall’ in the movie of the same name. She released her first album called 19 in 2008.

She cemented herself and her career with the album called 21 which gave her world fame and many of her most popular songs like “Rolling in the deep” and ” Someone like you”.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says US ‘not trustable’ partner,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi/Files) Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi/Files)

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday the US is not a trustable country to work with over international issues. Speaking in his swear-in ceremony in the Iranian parliament, Rouhani criticized the US for threatening the implementation of the nuclear deal, Xinhua reported.

He said that the Islamic republic would remain committed to the international nuclear deal and would not violate the nuclear deal signed between Iran and the six major powers two years ago. “However, Iran would not be silent in the face of US threats to the implementation of the deal,” he said, adding that “Tehran would reciprocate every threatening move by Washington in this regard.”

The Iranian President warned that “those who are thinking of tearing the accord into pieces, in actuality, would harm their political life.” The world would not thrust the United States anymore, he said.

Rouhani was alluding to the US President Donald Trump’s comments on Iran’s nuclear deal during his presidential campaign, as Trump repeatedly criticized the accord, calling it “the worst deal ever negotiated.” On Thursday, Iran denounced the recent endorsement of new sanctions against Tehran by the US President, saying that it violates nuclear deal.

Recent unilateral sanctions against Iran by the United States are mainly in response to Tehran’s growing missile program, the White House says Iran’s ballistic missile tests are in violation of the resolutions of the UN Security Council. Tehran has emphasized that its ballistic missile advancement is for deterrent purposes and the country will never negotiate over it. Tehran also said that the new US sanctions against Iran aimed at threatening the international community against cooperating with Iran, which will ultimately limit Iran’s gain from the fruits of the deal.

Iran and six world powers, namely Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, reached an agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue in July 2015, which put Tehran on the path of sanctions relief but with more strict limits on its nuclear program.

Neymar says father was against move to PSG,"The former Santos player will be presented to PSG fans on Saturday. (Source: Reuters) The former Santos player will be presented to PSG fans on Saturday. (Source: Reuters)

Paris St Germain’s world-record signing Neymar said on Thursday that his 222 million euros ($263 million) move from Barcelona was made against the wishes of his father and agent, Neymar Sr.

He did not expand on the exact nature of their disagreement, but in an Instagram post and video said, for the second time in his life, that he was contradicting his father. “I formed an attack with (Lionel) Messi and (Luis) Suarez that has gone down in history,” said the Brazilian striker. “I have won all that a player can win. But a player (me) needs challenges. And for the second time in my life, I’ll contradict my father. “Dad, I understand and respect your opinion but my decision has been taken. I ask that you support me as you always do.”

The 25-year-old has signed a five-year deal with the French side after they triggered the release clause in his Barcelona contract and said the decision to leave the club he joined in June 2013 was his and his alone.

“I feel in my heart that the time has come for me to leave,” he said. “It’s a very hard decision but I made it with the maturity I accumulated throughout those 25 years.”

Neymar’s father is one-half of their company NN Consultoria and the guiding light behind the money-spinning offshoots that have helped the Brazil striker become one of the world’s highest grossing athletes. Their commercial and advertising ventures have proven so lucrative that Neymar is sometimes referred to as Neymarketing.

The former Santos player will be presented to PSG fans on Saturday.

Media reports have said he could earn around 550,000 euros per week.

“PSG will be my new home for the next years and I will work to honour all of the trust placed in my football,” he added in the Instagram video. “I’m counting on the support of all of you who have been with me since 2009. “Fans, friends, professionals who are with me, and my family who suffered a lot with some problems that took place during that period in my career. Today you deserve peace.”

Venezuela restores opposition leader Ledezma’s house arrest,"People hold portraits of opposition leader Antonio Ledezma during a news conference at the Venezuelan coalition of opposition parties (MUD) headquarters in Caracas, Venezuela August 1, 2017.

Venezuela returned opposition leader Antonio Ledezma from prison to his home on Friday, hours before the government planned to inaugurate a new legislative superbody authorized to expand the powers of leftist President Nicolas Maduro. Ledezma and fellow opposition figure Leopoldo Lopez had been taken to prison from house arrest early on Tuesday after encouraging protests against the new constituent assembly, which will have the power to re-write the constitution and could allow Maduro to govern by decree.

The 545-member assembly was expected to hold its first session later in the day. The opposition, which boycotted the vote on the grounds that the creation of the assembly undermines basic democratic principles, is calling for protests against it. The Vatican issued a statement asking that Friday’s planned installation of the assembly be suspended and urged Venezuela’s security forces to avoid “excessive and disproportionate use of force” in dealing with protesters.

Governments from Spain to Canada to Argentina have spoken out against the assembly. Its election on Sunday prompted US President Donald Trump to label Maduro as a dictator. In a pre-dawn tweet, Ledezma’s wife said that her husband had just been brought to his residence.

“Several minutes ago, Antonio was unexpectedly returned by the Sebin (intelligence agency) to our home,” wrote Mitzy Capriles de Ledezma. “We thank the people of Venezuela and the international community for their concern and solidarity.”

It was not immediately evident whether Lopez would also be returned from jail to house arrest. Their supporters call them political prisoners. More than 120 people have meanwhile died in anti-Maduro protests over the last four months.

Among complaints against Maduro is his refusal to allow international aid to enter the country, which is in a deep recession and is suffering food and medicine shortages. The socialist leader says the assembly is needed to restore peace and prosperity to Venezuela. But the crisis shows no signs of abating. On Thursday Venezuela’s bolivar currency tumbled 18 percent in one day against the U.S. dollar on the black market.

The constituent assembly will have no checks on its power to re-arrange government institutions. Members elected to the new body have said they plan to fire Venezuelan Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega who this week opened an investigation into claims that the government inflated Sunday’s voter turnout numbers.

Pro-boxing circus of India: Struggles of boxers,"Pro boxing in India. Pro boxing in India.

Back in June 2015 when he announced that he was turning pro, Vijender Singh’s decision hogged all the headlines, as did his debut bout, a win over Sonny Whiting four months later. Over the next 14 months, the Olympic bronze medallist boxer maintained an unbeaten run, coasting to a professional win-loss record of 8-0.

On Saturday, when Vijender stepped into the ring, the stakes were the highest they’d ever been. He was defending the WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title while looking to take the Oriental Super Middleweight belt off China’s Zulpikaer Maimaitiali — his first undefeated opponent. Exactly who should have won the fight remains a debate for another day. But each punch that sent the Indian reeling shook the country’s nascent pro-boxing ambitions.

Vijender went the distance and walked away with the two belts. That British boxer Amir Khan believes he “hasn’t won half a major title” is a different matter altogether.

After eight drab fights, the novelty was long gone for the casual viewer; to the point that a glimpse of Baba Ramdev elicited more cheers than the in-ring action during Vijender’s two fights in Delhi. In that regard, the contentious ninth should at least fuel conversations. That it was postponed and took eight months to materialise though is worrying. Meanwhile, Vijender cut ties with Frank Warren’s Queensberry Promotions after the UK-based company shied away from putting together an overseas fight for the boxer.

Which leads us to the all-important question: if India’s biggest and most marketable star can’t sustain interest in pro boxing, what chance do the many hopefuls have?

Despite that, many an aspiring pugilist would have keenly followed every jab and hook Vijender threw on Saturday, hoping to follow in the trendsetter’s footsteps. Before any of them is able to set foot inside a ring, though, he or she will have to navigate a maze.

AIBA. APB. WSB. WBA. WBO. WBC. IBF. BFI. IABF. IBC. SBL. PBOI. IPBA. NIBA. In addition to an overwhelming myriad of acronyms, pro boxing in India suffers from backroom politics and lack of larger-than-life prizefighters.

The first call that all boxers have to take is to move away from the system that gives them medals, cash incentives and job security. The national body, for one, believes most still choose to stay on the well-trodden path of amateur boxing.

“Firstly, it is a matter of pride to represent your nation in international competition, to end up on the podium,” says Jay Kowli, general secretary of the Boxing Federation of India (BFI). “It has been applicable in the cases of Muhammad Ali to Mike Tyson. Then there’s cash prizes to be won at international events, and the kind of support that the government provides to amateur boxers, it is a great way of building a career as well.”

However, with the world body, International Boxing Association (AIBA), also giving a thrust to professional boxing in the form of AIBA Pro Boxing (APB) which facilitates pro boxers to compete at the Olympics, BFI can’t be dismissive of the alternate stream.

Kowli, however, believes, “Pro-boxing is never about producing boxers. They are not interested in promoting boxing, training people. They pick up boxers when they do well because they are just interested in big names and putting on their big shows. As far as the scene in India is concerned, everybody is free to assess. Brigadier (PK Muralidharan) Raja has his own boxing set-up. But what happened?”

What happened was, Raja — a boxing administrator who has been associated with the sport for upwards of three decades — launched his own pro boxing body Indian Boxing Council (IBC) in 2015, organised a few ‘fight nights’ and soon had to put them on hold indefinitely.

“It has not been a very happy journey so far,” Raja sums it up. “The plan was to organise around 30-40 fights nights. I was trying to put around 3-4 in a month. But I couldn’t do it all out of my retirement funds.”

Raja says he had plans to promote pro boxing before there was a bandwagon to jump on. While the idea first struck him in 2010 — when Vijender was still busy preparing for the London Olympics — Raja put in the homework during the last three years.

“I went all around the world to study this. I met promoters, bought books, studied the formats,” says Raja, former secretary general of the now-defunct national federation IABF. “The gameplan was simple. We needed to build the fighters. Give them fights, build their record. Once the good ones get filtered, we would get them national titles, then Asian, World. So, I put in whatever money I had, thinking once it picks up, people will come in. The people who did come in, didn’t have money themselves.”

While he is not out of the game yet — “IBC is willing to conduct technical operations” — putting together any more fight nights without a promoter is out of the question.

“We want it to happen. But I’ve spent close to Rs1 crore myself. My team can still help with the referees, judges, doctors and setting up the fights. If anybody wants to come on board as a promoter, the profit is theirs to keep.”

Many bodies, many minds

Jay Kowli clarifies that “I’m not happy when anything goes wrong because it is my sport.” While he wouldn’t comment on the ongoing Super Boxing League (SBL), other than wishing them luck, Kowli believes plans eventually go sour without proper streamlining.

“Because I’m coming from an organised system, I would like these set-ups to be accountable and answerable for everything. Otherwise, I feel it is very risky for boxing.”

As of now, there are multiple organisations and little streamlining. SBL — the second venture of promoter Bill Dosanjh after the MMA promotion Super Fight League — kicked off in July without much fanfare or the backing of the powers that be. Not that it bothers Dosanjh.

“At the end of the day, it’s best that it’s done by people who understand the sport,” Dosanjh told The Indian Express. “Me and Amir Khan understand the sport better than any federation set up in India. (BFI President) Ajay Singh is a chairman of SpiceJet, running a very successful business, but he doesn’t understand the sport. He has a special job at hand to build the fighters for the Olympics. We are here to help them turn pro with this exciting format.”

The format however reminds one of the old adage: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. What essentially is a sport of two people punching each other in the face has been twisted into a team competition, with six fighters per side fighting four 3-minute rounds and different number of points awarded to different finishes.

Raja explains: “League concept is not for boxing. It has been tried before by Don King in the 70s. The people trying to do it are thinking they’ll cash in on the mushrooming of leagues and sell franchises. At the end of the day, everybody will be taken for a ride. How are the franchises going to recover the money?”

“Bill has the money. But I don’t think these guys are here to develop things. They are not from India. Outsiders coming to India thinking they will get something with these one-off events is not what professional boxing needs. All of these small groups need to get together and make one consolidated effort. Currently everything is fragmented.”

Too many cooks spoil the pie, more so when each is in a hurry for a slice. India has a number of underground pro boxing bodies affiliated to organisations such as World Boxing Council (WBC), World Boxing Association (WBA) and World Boxing Organisation (WBO).

In addition to Raja’s IBC, there is the Professional Boxing Organisation of India (PBOI) which is overseeing the SBL. That the body’s general secretary Kunal Goyat’s brother Neeraj took part in the league, without an NOC from his employer Railways, adds to the convoluted mess. Then there’s Jai Shekhawat of Royal Sports Promotions and North India Boxing Association (NIBA) who alleges that the PBOI has breached an exclusivity deal by signing up with SBL, leaving his pro boxing league stuck in the pipeline.

There’s also the Indian Pro Boxing Association (IPBA), the president of which, Shahe Ali promises yet another league later this year, albeit one “on par with the IPL, to sell out the JLN and Indira Gandhi stadiums.” They sure have their task cut out, seeing how the Facebook page is still inviting donations. The group claims that it has also successfully invited Evander Holyfield to India to promote their league on Twitter, but have nothing more than the heavyweight legend’s retweets to cite.

Shekhawat, Ali and the elder Goyat were responsible for one of India’s earliest forays into professional boxing — a fight night in a Delhi mall two years back which launched Neeraj’s pro career. However, the infighting and the branching out stunted the growth of the sport. So what’s the solution?

“I would prefer a professional body set up under the federation,” says Kowli. “When the national federation runs pro boxing, the boxers will have more reason to be secure and in safe hands. The BFI is already working on a professional boxing programme of our own, to streamline everything. It’s in the final stages.”

Exactly what BFI plans to do with professional boxing remains a mystery. Meanwhile, some boxers who won laurels as amateurs, be it a national championship (Kuldeep Singh) or a Commonwealth Games bronze medal (Amandeep Singh), have taken the plunge and turned pro without waiting for BFI to clarify its intentions. Like the younger Goyat, Kuldeep and Amandeep also ran into trouble with the Railways for taking part in the SBL.

CHARACTER-BUILDING

Another odd stacked against pro boxing in India is that it is trying to take off when the sport has cooled off globally. The trash-talking draws of yesteryear are now few and far between. The ones who do crop up are plucked by MMA promotions.

Closer home, Vijender remains the only semblance of a draw. Neerav Tomar — head of IOS Boxing Promotions that has organised Vijender’s three home fights — admits that they need to look beyond the sole flag-bearer.

“Everything is on Vijender’s shoulders. Right now, it is just his stardom and success that we are capitalising on. At least till the time we find a new star,” says Tomar, adding that the 31-year-old is “still five or six fights away from a world title”.

Former light-welterweight world champion and Athens silver-medallist Amir Khan offers a more candid assessment.

“Vijender has not made a big noise,” the 30-year-old told The Indian Express. “He hasn’t won a major title, or even half a major title, which will make people regard him as a good fighter.”

The PR-driven, sanitised machine around Vijender hasn’t helped him develop an outlandish persona either, and the boxer himself has gone on record saying that “my conscience doesn’t allow me to talk trash.”

An exciting breakout is the need of the hour, and Brigadier Raja believes it could be a woman, citing 2014 CWG bronze medallist Sarita Devi as an example. Earlier this year, in front of a raucous crowd in her hometown Imphal, Sarita pummeled Hungarian Zsofia Bedo in her pro debut, only to return to the amateur fold soon after.

“I’m telling you, what we saw that night, she could be a world champion in 6-12 months. Same for Pinki Jangra. Unfortunately, I brought them here but couldn’t get further fights. So I talked to Mr Ajay Singh and told him that these girls are still the best in the country. I told him that let them be in the fray for the upcoming Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. And once they’re done, with your permission, they can return to pro boxing.”

Both Sarita and Pinki had to submit letters of apology to the federation, but Raja believes it was for the better. “I would also give priority to amateur boxing. Asian Games, Olympics is something special.”

Neeraj Goyat, however, wants to make his mark as a professional boxer. He came close too. The 25-year-old took part in AIBA’s Olympic qualifiers in Venezuela last year but fell one win short of booking a Rio berth.

“Amateur is important as you have to go to the nursery class to get to a college,” says Goyat, who defended his WBC-ABC welterweight title on Saturday. “But nobody remembers amateur boxers. Mike Tyson is famous because he was professional. Muhammad Ali wasn’t popular because of his Olympic medal. Boxing ka naam professionals ki wajah se hi chalta hai.”

NRAI asks Centre to reconsider GST on shooting equipments,"NRAI Senior Vice President and Member of Parliament, Kalikesh Narain Singh Deo, raised the issue of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on shooting and sports equipment. (Source: Express Archive) NRAI Senior Vice President and Member of Parliament, Kalikesh Narain Singh Deo, raised the issue of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on shooting and sports equipment. (Source: Express Archive)

The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) on Friday requested the Central Government to reconsider the GST tax structure of sports goods and shooting equipment.

NRAI Senior Vice President and Member of Parliament, Kalikesh Narain Singh Deo, raised the issue of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on shooting and sports equipment, in the Zero Hour of Lok Sabha on Friday.

Speaking at the Parliament, Singh Deo said, “Shooting has been one of the highest medal winners for India in international sports events, including Asian and Olympic level championship. In fact, India stands to gain most in terms of medals tally, if shooting is promoted.”

“Earlier renowned shooters were exempt from payment of custom duty for importing guns and ammunition. This wasinstrumental in building an array of potential Olympic medal winners. However, the new GST regime levies higher tax on importing of such goods. This will adversely affect the spirit of sports in our country. “It will especially reduce the potential of shooting to earn medals on behalf of India. I therefore request the Government to reconsider the GST tax structure of sports goods and shooting equipment in order to encourage participation of youngsters in the area of sports,” he added.

Donald Trump denies he called White House a ‘dump’,"US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

President Donald Trump has denied that he called the White House a “dump.” Trump responded on Twitter to an article posted Tuesday on the website golf.com. The story recounts a scene in which Trump was chatting with some club members at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump reportedly told the members he visits the property so frequently because “That White House is a real dump.”

Trump took to Twitter last night to deny he made the remark. “I love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen,” he tweeted. “But Fake News said I called it a dump – TOTALLY UNTRUE.”

Trump has spent nearly every weekend of his presidency visiting various properties he owns and leases, including Bedminster. He is expected to leave Friday on his first extended vacation from Washington since the inauguration, a 17-day getaway to the Bedminster club.

"Absent, Sir: Why a trans student dropped out of DU","When basic needs become a luxury, higher education is a distant dream for a trans person. (Source: Thinkstock Images) When basic needs become a luxury, higher education is a distant dream for a trans person. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Three years ago, when the Supreme Court affirmed the fundamental rights of the people of the “third gender”, Sneha Sharma, 23, was at the court complex in Delhi, dancing in celebration. A year later, when the Delhi University decided to admit trans students in postgraduate and undergraduate courses, she lined up to get a form. “It was after the judgement that I decided to give education another chance,” she says.

In Ajmer, her hometown, she was a boy, Pawan, who completed his schooling and then dropped out of a course in Bachelor of Commerce in Jaipur. “The boys had noticed that I was different. The way I used to walk, sit and talk was very feminine. They used to make fun of me, so I stopped going and eventually failed,” she says. In Delhi, she joined the School of Open Learning(SOL) of DU in an undergraduate course. But in three months, she had decided to call it quits. The reasons were many, both financial and social.

“When basic needs become a luxury, higher education is a distant dream for a trans person,” she says. At the time, she was working for a community-building organisation, which had not paid her for 10 months. “I was in a lot of debt. I had paid the college fees using the borrowed money,” she says.

The academic environment in college also did not encourage her much. “Some students did not study, some teachers did not teach, and every time, I went for the class, I had to brave the glances and stares from people around,” she says.

Recently, the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) announced that it would waive fees for all transgender students. Despite attempts such as these, it is difficult for trans people to access higher education. “Many have been disowned by their family and so they do not have official documents and certificates on them. Some have a problem with registration due to the confusion with their names. Gender-neutral facilities like washrooms are not available on campus,” says Sneha, who is now a counsellor at a clinic run by HIV/AIDS Alliance India in Noida.

University spaces aren’t welcoming of transgender students, admits Dr Rajesh, a professor in the department of adult continuing education and extension, DU. He also believes that the enrolment is already declining. “No one wants to share the exact number of students as they are from a vulnerable community,” he says. There is a need for a platform where they can go for redressal, like the ST/SC cells in colleges, he says.

After quitting college, Sneha joined a traditional hijra community for two months, out of sheer helplessness. “The debt was rising and one can earn nearly Rs 3,000 a day while working with the toli,” she says. “It is a very exploitative system. The gurus do not want any governmental schemes to reach them as it will disrupt the status quo,” says Anjan Joshi, who runs Space, a Delhi-based NGO working with the transgender community.

While Sneha works in an office now, several other trans students are tentatively stepping into university spaces. “Everyone has to be sensitised about their rights. Change will not be seen in three years, it will, at least, take a decade,” says Dr Rajesh.

"India vs Sri Lanka: After collapse, Sri Lanka grow spine","Sri Lankan batsmen Dimuth Karunaratne (92*) and Kusal Mendis (110) added 191 runs for the second wicket on Day Three of the second Test in Colombo. (Source: AP) Sri Lankan batsmen Dimuth Karunaratne (92*) and Kusal Mendis (110) added 191 runs for the second wicket on Day Three of the second Test in Colombo. (Source: AP)

With the index finger on his lips, Virat Kohli stood bemused at slips. Ravindra Jadeja kicked the ground in angst, the violence swirling a brown plume of dust. The rest of them rambled aimlessly in their assigned nooks of the field. It was the first time in this series that India seemed to hit a roadblock, stuck in the wake of an unseemly Sri Lankan resistance, when it seemed that the visitors would hurtle towards a ripping win before grey clouds engulfed the stadium.

But six over before stumps, Hardik Pandya restored the characteristic verve, stubbing the flickering embers of an improbable draw by dismissing the centurion Kusal Mendis, the latter contriving to drag a cutter to his pads, from where it ricocheted into Wriddhiman’s Saha’s outstretched palms. Even through their 191-run stand, the eventuality of a defeat loomed inevitably, but for nearly two sessions, they had the Indians on tenterhooks. It would still be a Herculean effort for them to escape unscathed, for they are 230 runs adrift, but the pair demonstrated that the talk of Sri Lankan cricket’s demise is grossly exaggerated.

Mendis and Karunaratne were like a pair of comrades fighting a doomed revolution, with only optimism to fuel their fight. Their weapon of ambush was sweep, both the conventional and unorthodox. It challenged conventional wisdom — on a surface with wickedly uneven bounce, it’s suicidal to sweep. A top edge loomed like falcons that hovered over the stadium. But when you are young and brave, you defy conventions, unhinged by consequences.

As early as the second ball of the sixth over, Karunaratne, strong and stocky, sunk on his knees and attempted a reverse sweep. It fluttered of his top-edge over the keeper. Ashwin grimaced, shrugged his head, as if suggesting, “I have your number.” The ball with his number is yet to be stamped, though. A few overs later, he ventured another reverse sweep of a similar delivery. It was a carbon copy, and it fluttered again over the leaping backward short-leg.

A recurring pattern

If the Indians felt that those were just attempts at foiling their line, they were mistaken. It became a recurring pattern, a concerted effort to derail their lengths. A carnage of sweeps, orchestrated by Mendis, short and robust, a physical foil to Karunaratne followed. The same over, he swat-swept Ashwin, the ball screaming through midwicket. That was his peculiarity, he didn’t attempt to sweep fine, which is riskier and less productive. But when you’re sweeping in front of the wicket, a boundary beckons almost always, Also, since you’re expending a lot of power, which Mendis did, even a top-edge might sail over the ropes.

So he would just thrust his front pad, his head steady and outside the line of the ball, and muscle it wherever he chose to. In hindsight, his predilection for the aerial route nullified the risk of a top edge. It’s when a batsman tries to force it on the ground by closing the bat face that it often takes a top edge. Here he was swinging it fluidly, much to the discomfort of the Indian spinners, who felt a a little stirred. It also helped that Mendis is relatively shorter, so that he gets a good balance when he executes the short. “You don’t miss the ball and get out LBW very often playing that shot, if you’re short,” said Ashwin.

Remarkably, Mendis plundered 42 runs off 21 balls with his sweeps. Their frustration only swelled when the occasional delivery fizzed past their outside edge. Not to flinch away from the challenge, the Indian spinners kept varying their length, angle and trajectory, but still couldn’t force a breakthrough. In the bargain, they began to bowl shorter. It relieved Karunaratne, who began to essay the forceful cuts.

Unlike Mendis, Karunaratne swept less frequently, deployed it chiefly as a release shot or to consign the close-in cordon to run-saving positions. As the partnership wore on, he was content playing the second fiddle to Mendis, who though never shirked away from his instincts. He batted with throwback pragmatism. Mendis, fittingly, completed his firebrand hundred with a sweep.

But the trailblazer of the revolution was Niroshan Dickwella, who swept nonchalantly in the first innings before one sweep too many undid him. Consequently, during the innings break, the discussion in the dressing room was all about playing the sweep more often, danger-prone though it is, it offered a sliver of hope, the last strand of ebbing hope. “During the break we had a lengthy chat about playing the spinner and we arrived at a theory that playing sweeps is the best way out of the situation. Risky yes, but rewarding too. It’s also a shot that we’ve practise a lot everyday,” pointed out Dickwella.

It also benefited the Lankan batsmen that the strip had lost much of its vim in the first session. In the morning, the pitch seemed an unforgiving examination chamber, every ball spitting off the surface like a hand-grenade. Ashwin corroborated: “As the ball got older and we bowled the second time around, it is kind of fizzling out and the edges aren’t carrying that much to the fielders.”

In hindsight, Sri Lanka would feel they could’ve batted better in the first dig. For all the viciousness of the strip, there was just one least defendable delivery, which devoured Dhananjay de Silva. The 90kmph-Jadeja ball drifted in and whooshed away marginally to hit his stumps. Dickwella admitted as much. Sometime on the fourth day will beckon his chance to keep fight going, however futile it may seem.

Dubai The Marina Torch fire: All you need to know about the tower’s second blaze since 2015,"Smoke and fire rise from a high rise building at Marina district in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Friday, Aug. 4, 2017.

A fire ripped through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, the latest in a series of fires in tall structures in the United Arab Emirates, the Gulf’s tourism and business hub, over the past three years. Flames shot up the sides of the Torch tower in the second blaze to hit the high-rise since 2015, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee as burning debris showered down the sides of the 1,105 foot (337 metre)-tall, 79-storey structure.

The tower was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze. But the incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the wealthy Gulf region and beyond. An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.

What may have caused of the fire?

Most of Dubai’s approximately 250 high-rise buildings use cladding panels with thermoplastic cores, UAE media have reported. Panels can consist of plastic or polyurethane fillings sandwiched between aluminium sheets. Such cladding is not necessarily hazardous, but it can be flammable under certain circumstances and, depending on a skyscraper’s design, may channel fires through windows into the interiors of buildings.

The UAE revised its building safety code in 2013 to require cladding on all new buildings over 15 metres (50 feet) tall be fire-resistant, but older buildings are exempt. In pics: Second fire in two years, firefighters douse massive flames. Click here.

Dubai’s civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze around 4.00 am (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building. Firefighters and police sealed off surrounding streets, which were partially covered by dust and debris. By 4.00 a.m. the exterior of the building showed no sign of fire as residents and onlookers stood around staring up at the building, according to a Reuters witness.

Shelter for the victims

“We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming. We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor,” a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters. “It was very bad. The fire was very strong at that time, about 1 am. Then it started calming down over the next two hours,” he added.

Another resident, whose gave his name as Mohammed and lives on the 12th floor, said the top part of the tower caught fire first and then lower levels followed as debris fell. The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected by the fire.

Dubai is one of seven emirates that make up the UAE, where several residential compounds and hotels have been hit by fire in recent years. In some of those cases, experts said the flames may have been encouraged to spread by exterior cladding.

In August 2016 a fire swept through a 28-storey building under construction in the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi, injuring 13 people, including 10 emergency service personnel. Earlier that same month, a fire damaged part of a multi-storey building under construction in Dubai and in July 2016 a fire broke out in Dubai’s residential 75-storey Sulafa Tower. On New Year’s Eve 2015, a blaze hit a Dubai hotel.

UP Congress asks district units to send report on rent paid for its office buildings,"The districts units have reportedly also been asked to send copies of documents related to ownership, rent or lease, to the state party office. (Representational image) The districts units have reportedly also been asked to send copies of documents related to ownership, rent or lease, to the state party office. (Representational image)

Days after the Lucknow Municipal Corporation issued a notice to the state Congress, questioning its ownership claim over its office in the city, the party has written to its districts units, allegedly inquiring about the status of all its office buildings — whether the party owns the properties or rents them. The districts units have reportedly also been asked to send copies of documents related to ownership, rent or lease, to the state party office. Sources said the step was taken on the directives from party’s top leadership, so that Congress does not face further embarrassment or controversy over any of its offices in the districts.

Letters in this regard, issued by UP Congress Committee state general secretary (administration) Pramod Singh, have been sent to all district presidents last week. He, however, denied that the letters are in any way connected to the Lucknow office ownership controversy. “Reports regarding rent (paid) has been sought from district units where party offices are operating in buildings taken on rent or lease. While Congress has its own office buildings in 21 districts, in others, offices are running either in buildings taken on rent or in government properties hired on lease,” said Singh.

“Rent is being paid regularly and the state headquarters seeks written information from districts every month. This is a routine process,” he said, adding that Baghpat, Kushinagar, Fatehpur, Kanpur Dehat, Shrawasti and Gorakhpur are among the few districts where offices have been taken on rent. However, presidents of many districts claimed the party had not earlier inquired about how much rent is paid for the office. When contacted, Baghpat district president Chaudhary Ram Kumar said: “The party office was set up in a rented building nearly four years ago… I had never been asked regarding the rent being paid. We have been paying the rent from our own resources.”

Amar Nath Singh, who was made the Fatehpur Congress president two years ago, said that since the last 15 years, the party office is being run from around a 1,200 sq feet hall in his residence. “No rent is paid… The party had never sought any information regarding the office in these two years,” he added. Kanpur Dehat district president Neetam Sachan said he had taken a building on rent near the district magistrate’s office in 2014 to set up the party office. “Around a year ago, the state headquarters had inquired about the amount of rent being paid, but the party never reimbursed us or paid the rent. It had also never asked about rent agreement documents,” he added.

President of Shrawasti unit, Ajay Singh, said: “Shrawasti was earlier a part of Bahraich and was made a separate district around 18 years ago. But no permanent office has been set up here till date. Earlier, meetings used to be held at the houses of party workers. When I was appointed the district president in 2014, I set up the party office in my house. While the state headquarters had assured that it will pay the rent, nothing of the sort has happened till now.”

In Kushinagar, the Congress office runs in a building owned by former party MP and Union Minister R P N Singh.

Earlier this year, Congress had lost its district office in Gorakhpur following a 40-year-long legal battle. The office was vacated on April 4 following court orders. The court had ruled in favour of Shobhit Agrawal, whose grandfather Laxman Das had given around 1,000 square feet on rent to the party nearly 50 years ago.

Promised empowerment of trans people and the new dealers of a false liberty,"Trans rights may have come to be globally seen as the new “civil rights” and India may be quoted as a shining model. But the authorship, labour and gains of the movements are in a severe hierarchy. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) Trans rights may have come to be globally seen as the new “civil rights” and India may be quoted as a shining model. But the authorship, labour and gains of the movements are in a severe hierarchy. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)

In the last few months, one of the most publicised developments in trans rights in India was the employment of 23 transgender women by the Kochi Metro. On May 17, 2017, a newspaper carried a piece titled: ‘In a first, transgenders get jobs at Kochi Metro’. Elias George, KMRL’s MD, said: “We would like to give members of the community their rightful share in different jobs at stations. There will be no discrimination between them and women workers.”

Having made these progressive claims, George is reported to have said: “Moreover, [they] cannot be blamed since they are born with such a biological situation.” Clearly, he had no understanding of “transgender” and conflated it with “intersex”. Nor did the newspaper see how it was robbing the community of human dignity by its language. “In a first, transgender persons get jobs at Kochi Metro”, would have been right by us.

On July 6, a police case was registered against six transgender persons,including some of the trans women employed by KMRL, for dacoity and uttering obscenities. No statement has been forthcoming since from KMRL.

From pity to impunity

In the year 1994, a Mumbai-based NGO was established to work in the area of HIV-AIDs. With funding in the area having declined, the NGO has now moved into the domain of transgender rights. In May, it announced an event to mark IDAHOT, the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, and the event was held at the American Centre, New Delhi. The invitation asked people to carry “valid photo IDs”. Some of the trans people were asked to register using their “real name”, i.e. their “legal name”. Many in the community were enraged. Here was an organisation taking funds to defend trans rights and grossly violating the very idea of “self-identification of gender”. The anger was soon followed by self-censorship and silencing of others in the community.

Despite such pressures, one trans man decided to call them out via an open letter, detailing his experience and teaching the organisation the often understated, but critical reality that, “gender dysphoria is real”. (Gender dysphoria is the distress that arises as a result of a culture that stigmatizes people who do not conform to conventional gender norms.) Not a word of apology from the organisation has been issued till date. Not a single attempt at engagement with the person who wrote the letter.

Within a month, the organisation announced another event, again, at the American Centre, New Delhi. Again, a valid photo identification in original was needed for entry. It also informed that visitors maybe featured in photos and videos to be used for promotional purposes or on social media by the American Centre or the US Embassy.

The Bill

It has been three years since the 2014 Supreme Court’s judgement and, a little less, since Tiruchi Shiva’s robust first version of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill. The judgement was to be implemented within six months, but that period is long past. The current distorted and diluted version of the TG Bill has been pushed from one session of Parliament to another, an orphan bill for which there has been no political will so far.

On July 21, the “recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the TG Bill” were tabled in Parliament. Its preface ended with these unbelievable words of affirmation: “The Committee would like to assure and remind all the members of transgender community that, ‘A historic shift is underway, you are not alone in your struggle for the end of violence and discrimination. It is a shared struggle. Transgender is not an anomaly. It is a part of the spectrum of people’s realities. While there is no shame in being gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex or even straight — there is most certainly shame and dishonor in being a homophobe, a transphobe and a bigot”.

And yet, days later, Ramdas Athawale, founder of the Ambedkarite organisation, Republican Party of India, said, “They are not men, they are not women, but they are human…why should they wear a sari when they are not women? They can wear pant and shirt. They should be wearing men’s dress.” Athawale is also a minister of state at the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, the very ministry tasked with the work on the transgender bill. It remains to be seen what the PMO does with the recommendations.

Third gender? Not us

The biggest tragedy in the entire hullaballoo about trans rights is that it has come to be seen as the rights of the “third gender”, rather than the legitimisation by the highest court of the land, of two ideas: self-identification of gender and the delinking of sex and gender. The former is the idea that, as human beings, we have a deep sense of our gender and that may not be binary in the sense that is conventionally understood by society: just the two categories of man and woman. As a result, all of us have the right to a social gender of our choice, and the right to self-define our legal gender. This also means that sex and gender are, therefore, two different conceptual categories. Just like gender is more than a binary idea, sex, too, is more than just “male and female” — thereby acknowledging and affirming intersex individuals. (While self-identification of gender is ascribed as a demand by trans people, it has been a right much in place since time immemorial for cis people. The fact that cis people identify with the gender assigned to them, socially and legally, is, in itself, evidence of this.)

The “third gender” demand has been mostly driven by the hijra communities. A large part of the trans masculine, the non-traditional trans feminine and the intersex communities — the minorities within the minorities — do not identify with third gender. What we stand to lose is a political moment of freeing up both gender and sex from their conventional burdens. While hijras and other traditional trans feminine persons and their communities are entitled to the rights that the SC has affirmed, it will be a loss of incalculable proportions if they, and the government of the day, do not acknowledge the different genealogies and ontologies of trans masculine, non-traditional trans feminine and intersex lives.

Boundaries for our utopias

In the meantime, a clear shift has taken place in the international funding for trans rights. While some globetrotting Indian trans celebrities raise their voice at the UN, back home they cover their head in a sari’s pallu, selling out our communities to a nativist agenda. Additionally, some erstwhile HIV-AIDs NGOs are busy shifting their targeted constituencies and organisational alignments, in order to compete for the newly emerging trans funds. In all of this, trans persons continue their daily struggle of survival, at the mercy of the government’s pity, on the one hand, and NGO impunity, on the other.

Most of the current trans and intersex voices do not access their elected representatives directly, but are mostly controlled and mediated via these erstwhile HIV-AIDs NGOs. This is a very telling sign of our times. Various strands of the Indian trans movement, if one can call it that, are seemingly headed towards the NGO model themselves. There is enough scholarship to show how the tensions between political motivation, a primary source for activism, and the inevitability in a funder-driven framework of becoming a professional activist, tends to be resolved — who provides the labour and who becomes the ultimate beneficiary. It remains to be seen, if the trans movements will carve out and retain an independent politics at the core, or, like the women’s and sexualities movements before, become mostly reduced to the “service provision” model.

Trans rights may have come to be globally seen as the new “civil rights” and India may be quoted as a shining model. But the authorship, labour and gains of the movements are in a severe hierarchy. A hierarchy that will continue to keep the communities at the bottom of the resource base, the NGOs playing middle-men and gatekeepers to elected representatives and international funders, and the governments at the top, refusing to reimagine foundational ideas of gender and sex. Perhaps, these are the outer limits of a trans utopia that will firmly be kept in place by our neoliberal, capitalist times.

Two former Thailand PMs acquitted over 2008 protest deaths,"Somchai Wongsawat and Chavalit Yongchaiyudh both hail from the political faction loyal to Thaksin Shinawatra, the self-exiled billionaire tycoon who sits at the heart of Thailand’s festering political divide.

(Source: AP photo)

Thailand’s highest court on Wednesday acquitted two ex-prime ministers and two former top police officers over their role in a 2008 crackdown on anti-government protesters that killed two people. Former premier Somchai Wongsawat and his then-deputy Chavalit Yongchaiyudh faced negligence charges over a police operation to remove protesters who had laid seige to parliament.

The deadly incident was one of many violent flare-ups over the past decade between their political camp, a populist movement led by former premier Thaksin Shinawtra, and a conservative Bangkok-based establishment.

Police fought pitched battles with demonstrators, some of whom possessed homemade bombs, and fired multiple rounds of tear gas. Two died and hundreds were wounded.

After the military seized power in 2014, authorities put the four men on trial.

But in its ruling today nine judges dismissed the case, arguing that authorities had a responsibility to clear the protesters because they had not remained peaceful and that none of the defendants bore direct responsibility for the deaths.

“The protesters surrounded parliament and threatened to storm the building, therefore it was not a peaceful rally. The authorities had to use force in order to clear the way,” the court said in its published summary. “The court has dismissed the case,” it added.

Somchai and Chavalit both hail from the political faction loyal to Thaksin Shinawatra, the self-exiled billionaire tycoon who sits at the heart of Thailand’s festering political divide.

Somchai, Thaksin’s brother-in-law, was prime minister at the time of the crackdown while Chavalit had previously served as premier in the 1990s.

Thaksin was ousted by the army in 2006, setting off a decade of instability marked by frequent bouts of political violence, short-lived governments and another army putsch in 2014.

Parties run by or allied to Thaksin’s clan have won every election since 2001, largely through the support of rural and poor voters from the populous north who adore them.

But they are loathed by much of Bangkok’s royalist elite and their military allies who have used street protests, the courts and coups to crush their opponents.

During the 2008 protests it was the anti-Shinawatra faction — dubbed the “Yellow Shirts” — who were laying siege to parliament.

Later that year the Yellow Shirts famously occupied Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport in an attempt to topple the government, an action that led to the stranding of tens of thousands of holidaymakers in the kingdom.

Two years later the tables turned. The Yellow Shirt faction was in power and it was the Shinawatras’ “Red Shirt” allies who were now blockading swathes of Bangkok — resulting in an army crackdown that killed more than 90.

No one has been prosecuted for those deaths. Some of the senior officers behind that 2010 crackdown later led the 2014 coup that brought the current junta to power.

"Stephen Curry misses cut, still impresses golf’s best","Stephen Curry after finishing the first round on the ninth green during Ellie Mae Classic golf tournament. (Source: AP) Stephen Curry after finishing the first round on the ninth green during Ellie Mae Classic golf tournament. (Source: AP)

Stephen Curry missed the cut Friday night against professional golfers one notch below the PGA Tour.

But not before leaving some of golf’s best players impressed that a two-time MVP for the Golden State Warriors could enter their arena and look respectable.

Curry opened with a 4-over 74 on the TPC Stonebrae and needed a career round to stay for the weekend. He shot a 74 again on Friday to finish tied for 148th. He missed the cut by 11 shots.

Curry bogeyed two of the first three holes on Friday and shot a 39 on a 3-hour front nine. He made five straight pars and birdied No. 14 but he played the final three holes at plus-1 with two bogeys and a birdie on 17.

No matter.

“That was awesome what he did yesterday,” British Open champion Jordan Spieth said Friday at the Bridgestone Invitational. “I think he certainly beat most everybody’s expectations, but I don’t think that really surprised him. It was pretty cool really cool to see. You see him fist-pumping out there, and just him talking about how nervous he was when he heard his name called, it just makes us feel a little better when sometimes some of the stuff he does looks like a robot.”

Stanford alum Andrew Yun shot a 62 on Friday and finished two rounds at 8-under 127. Fellow American Brandon Harkins is two shots back after rounds of 64 and 65.

One of the highlights for Curry in the opening round was a long birdie putt and telling his caddie to “Go get that” from the cup. That was the famous line Spieth said to his caddie at Royal Birkdale two weeks ago after a 50-foot eagle putt to take the lead.

“To be honest, I think it’s pretty special for a two-time MVP to be able to shoot 74 at a pro event and beat other pros,” former PGA champion Jason Day said.

No one expected very much out of Curry, who last year played in the pro-am at the PGA Tour’s season opener in Napa. The field included players who have competed in majors this year, and seven players who have won on the PGA Tour.

The question in some corners was how high his score would be.

“I was asked if I thought he was going to break 80, and that’s the hand grenade question,” Paul Casey said. “But 4 over is really good. It’s a lot of pressure, and he exceeded my expectations.”

Zach Johnson, a two-time major champion, said he has a friend who knows Curry and said he was a good player. The score in the first round was enough to make a believer out of Johnson.

“Clearly, he is,” Johnson said. “I don’t know that golf course. Someone said they shoot pretty low there often, but it doesn’t matter. You’ve still got to put the ball in the hole. First round as an amateur in a professional tournament? That’s pretty good.”

Johnson vaguely recalled the time Jerry Rice, the Hall of Fame receiver for the San Francisco 49ers, played in the tournament. Rice shot 90.

“He’s a good athlete. They’re both good athletes,” Johnson said. “I’m not going to be playing for the 49ers.”

Today is Earth Overshoot Day: We have officially run out of natural resources for this year,"The Yamuna flood plains (Express Photo/Oinam Anand, File) The Yamuna flood plains (Express Photo/Oinam Anand, File)

Today, August 2, marks Earth Overshoot Day, the day humans exceed the amount of resources Earth can generate to sustain the population for the entire year. This is the earliest, since 1969, the occasion has been marked. The date every year is calculated by comparing the total yearly consumption by humans — also known as our ecological footprint — with Earth’s ability to regenerate natural resources in the same year. According to an independent think-tank, Global Footprint Network, we currently require 1.7 Earths to sustain our demands.

In 1969, the first year in which the global footprint was calculated by the private organisation, it was in sync with the biocapacity and Earth could sustain our demands for just over the entire year. Since then, Earth Overshoot Day has gradually been advancing. In 2001, Earth Overshoot Day fell in October, while it advanced to September in 2009. Last year, Earth Overshoot Day fell on August 3, while in 2015 it fell on August 5.

The months in which Earth Overshoot Day has been marked since 1969. (Source: Global Footprint Network) The months in which Earth Overshoot Day has been marked since 1969. (Source: Global Footprint Network)

According to Global Footprint Network, which has listed solutions to help move the date back, cutting back on carbon emissions by 50 per cent will help move the date by nearly 89 days. Similarly, reducing global food waste by half can help move the date by 11 days. Eating less protein-intensive food can move Overshoot Day by a month.

Further, if we delay Earth Overshoot Day by 4.5 days every year, we could return to living within the means of one Earth by 2050. By overspending natural resources beyond its capacity to regenerate, we are causing deforestating, drought, fresh-water scarcity, soil erosion, biodiversity loss and increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Each country’s ecological footprint can be compared as well. As per the most recent data of 2013, it would take 3.1 Earths if everyone lived like the Swiss — using three times what is available for exploitation — as opposed to 0.6 Earths if people lived like Indians. If humanity was to live like Americans, we would require 5 Earths, as per the Global Footprint Network.

Juan Mata calls on footballers to pledge one percent salary for charity,"Juan Mata has stated that he will be donating one per cent of his salary to charity Juan Mata has stated that he will be donating one per cent of his salary to charity

Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata has stated that he will be donating one per cent of his salary to charity. However, he also called upon other footballers to follow his lead and contribute towards a noble cause and help the world become a better place to live in.

Mata issued the challenge after sharing a short film which was shot during his trip to Mumbai where he visited the slums and interacted with the locals and played street football. “One of the first lessons I learned in football is that it takes a team to win a game”, Mata said and added, “We live by this mantra on the pitch, yet we rarely see it play out in the social impact space, which is dominated by individual initiatives. Through Common Goal we’re creating a collaborative way for football to give back to society. I urge my fellow players to get involved.” “It’s a small gesture that if shared can change the world,” Mata also wrote in a blog for the Player’s Tribune.

Common Goal is a collective fund of 120 charities in 80 countries around the world.

Although Common Goal is launching with a focus on players, its long-term vision is to unlock 1% of the entire football industry’s revenues—conservatively estimated at $30 billion per year—for grassroots football charities that use the game to strengthen their communities.

“Players are a great place to start because they’re the stars of the show,” explains streetfootballworld CEO Jürgen Griesbeck. “But this is the first step of a giant global endeavour. Imagine the entire industry uniting in the name of social change. Together we can usher in a new era for football and forge a deeper sense of purpose at the heart of the game.”

(PTI Photo)

The GST Council today cut tax rate on some tractor parts from 28 per cent to 18 per cent and lowered the rate on job work on all textile related items to 5 per cent instead of 18 per cent.

The Council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising representatives of all states, also finalised the e-way bill that mandates pre-registration of all goods worth over Rs 50,000 before they are moved for sale beyond 10 km.

Briefing reporters after the meeting, he said the date of application of the e-way bill would be notified shortly. It will not be applicable for exempted goods.

Work contracts under GST will be taxed at 12 per cent with input tax credit. He said more than 71 lakh central and state taxpayers have migrated to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system and and have completed registration. Another 15.67 lakh new applications for registration have been received.

He appealed to businesses to pass on the benefit of the reduced tax under GST to consumers, failing which the anti-profiteering mechanism will be triggered. TheCouncil will meet next on September 9 in Hyderabad, Jaitley added.

"Sad that boos were louder than cheers, says Justin Gatlin after beating Usain Bolt","Justin Gatlin of the U.S. after winning the race. (Source: Reuters) Justin Gatlin of the U.S. after winning the race. (Source: Reuters)

Justin Gatlin won the 100metres final on Sunday in 9.92 seconds after beating Usain Bolt into third place. However, more than cheers, he was awarded by booes from the crowd in response to two bans for drugs offences.

Gatlin said that he was sad that his boos were louder than cheers. “It’s kinda sad that my boos were louder than some of the others’ cheers. I wanted to keep it classy and at the end of the race bend the knee to Usain. Pay homage to him. This night is still a magical night for track and field and for Usain Bolt; he’s done so much in his career,” he said.

“I wasn’t booed in 2010, 2011 or 2012 – or 13, 14 or 15 – and now I am. I’m just sitting up here, I’m a runner, I’m back in the sport, I’ve done my time, I’ve done community service. I’ve talked to kids, I inspire kids – that’s all I can do,” the American added.

“Society does that with people who make mistakes and I hope track and field can understand that too.”

Bolt, who finished third behind American Christian Coleman, agreed. “I wasn’t focused on the boos, I wasn’t thinking about whether my win tonight was a disaster for the sport,” he said.

“I really did it for my fans, my support staff, my countrymen, the people who really believe in me, even when I didn’t believe in myself,” he added. “For the first time I was thinking about them not myself and it took the pressure off.”

"Woman falls off scooter that hit pothole, run over by tanker","A 30-year-old Delhi government school teacher died after she fell from her husband’s scooter, which had hit a pothole, and then got run over by an incoming tanker, in outer Delhi’s Kanjhawala area. (Source: Google Maps) A 30-year-old Delhi government school teacher died after she fell from her husband’s scooter, which had hit a pothole, and then got run over by an incoming tanker, in outer Delhi’s Kanjhawala area. (Source: Google Maps)

A 30-year-old Delhi government school teacher died after she fell from her husband’s scooter, which had hit a pothole, and then got run over by an incoming tanker, in outer Delhi’s Kanjhawala area. The incident took place on Friday afternoon and the tanker’s driver was arrested from the spot, police said, adding that he has been released on bail.

According to police, the victim, Usha, taught at a school in Shahbad Dairy and lived with her husband and children in Kanjhawala village. “The incident took place around 1.30 pm when the couple were heading home. Her husband appears to have lost balance on Kanjhawala Road. His scooty got stuck in a pothole filled with water, and his wife fell down,” a senior police officer said, adding that her husband also fell from the vehicle.

Before Usha could get up, she was run over by a water tanker that was right behind the scooter, police said. Preliminary investigation revealed that though the driver of the water tanker had applied emergency brakes, he could not stop in time as the vehicle appeared to be speeding.

“The driver seems to have lost control. The victim came under the tyres and her head was crushed,” the officer said. Locals rushed to help her and informed police about the incident. After receiving a PCR call, police took the woman to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared her dead.

“Doctors said Usha died due to head injuries and excessive bleeding. The body was preserved for a post-mortem examination and handed to her family on Saturday afternoon,” said the officer. Her husband was discharged after first-aid, and he gave his complaint to police.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (outer district) M N Tiwari said they have arrested the accused, who allegedly tried to escape after the accident. “We have also impounded his vehicle,” he said. An eyewitness, Suresh Kumar, said, “The pothole was flooded with water and nobody could have judged its depth.”

"No decision yet on UN ban on Masood Azhar, says China","Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar

China on Wednesday said it will take “a decision in due course” about the pending application in the UN to designate Pakistan-based JeM terror group leader Masood Azhar as a terrorist when it comes for a review.

“The Chinese side will make the decision in due course,” the Foreign Ministry told PTI reportrs in Beijing about the pending application proposed by the US, the UK and France among others in the 1267 anti-terrorism committee of the UN Security Council.

Early this year, China had put a six-month technical hold on the application which is expected to come up for review shortly.

“We have stated China’s position on the listing of the 1267 Committee of the UN Security Council many times” in the past, the ministry said in a written response.

China has been blocking India’s move stating that there is no consensus in the UNSC 1267 which enforces a global ban on terror groups and their leaders with affiliations to Al-Qaeda and Islamic State. JeM has already been in the banned list.

This is the second-year China has blocked attempts to bring about a UN ban on Azhar which would force Pakistan to act against him.

India moved for the UN ban against Azhar in March last year accusing him of masterminding the Pathankot terrorist attack.

China first blocked the Indian move for six months followed by three months technical hold, which ended on December 31 last year leading to the lapse of the application.

China was the only member in the 15-nation UN body to put a hold on India’s application with all other 14 members of the Council supporting New Delhi’s bid to place Azhar on the 1267 sanctions list that would subject him to an assets freeze and travel ban.

This year the US along with the UK and France approached the Committee again for the ban and Beijing once again put a six-month technical hold.

"US daily posts transcripts of Trump’s calls with Mexican President Pena Nietro, Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull","Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto; right. Donald Trump; centre and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto; right. Donald Trump; centre and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

A leading American daily on Thursday posted highly classified transcripts of Donald Trump’s conversations with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in yet another embarrassing leak for the US President. In his conversation with Nieto, according to the transcripts, Trump is heard pleading that the latter should stop saying that Mexico would not pay for the wall.

In his conversation with the Australian Prime Minister, Trump is heard getting agitated on the refugee issue and eventually telling him that the call was the most irksome of the day.

Transcripts of both the conversations that happened on January 27 and 28 respectively were posted by The Washington Post. The top American daily is now owned by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. Notably in the last few days, Amazon has succumbed to the Chinese demands on restricted internet freedom.

The White House today did not immediately comment on the embarrassing leak of Trump’s conversations with world leaders. In a statement, The Washington Post said the transcripts were prepared by the White House but have not been released.

“The Post is publishing reproductions rather than original documents in order to protect sources. The reproductions below also include minor spelling and grammatical mistakes that appeared in the documents,” it said.

As per the transcripts, Trump is heard asking the Mexican leader not to tell the press that Mexico would not pay for the construction of the wall along the US-Mexico border.

The building of the wall was one of the major electoral promises of the US President. During his election campaign, Trump had said that Mexico would pay for the wall. Pena Nieto has repeatedly said that Mexico will not pay for the wall.

“You cannot say that to the press. The press is going to go with that and I cannot live with that. You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances,” Trump told Pena Nieto, according to the transcripts.

In his conversation with Turnbull, Trump says that accepting the refuges will “make us look awfully bad”.

“We have to stop. We have allowed so many people into our country that should not be here. We have our San Bernardino’s, we have had the World Trade Center come down because of people that should not have been in our country, and now we are supposed to take 2,000. It sends such a bad signal. You have no idea. It is such a bad thing,” Trump is quoted as saying in the transcripts.

The conversation between the two leaders grew sour as Trump rejected an agreement to take refugees.

“I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day,” Trump told Turnbull. “(Russian President Vladimir) Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous,” said the US President, as he abruptly ends the call.

"I’m not China’s new hope, says Zhang Yuning","Zhang Yuning is the only member of Marcello Lippi’s China squad playing professionally in Europe. (Source: AP) Zhang Yuning is the only member of Marcello Lippi’s China squad playing professionally in Europe. (Source: AP)

China striker Zhang Yuning has sought to temper expectations in his homeland after completing a two-year loan move to Germany’s Werder Bremen last month.

The 20-year-old was signed by West Bromwich Albion from Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem on a three-year contract in early July before being immediately loaned out to the Bundesliga side.

The move was widely welcomed at home as Zhang became the first Chinese striker to join a Bundesliga side since Yang Chen’s five-year stint with Eintracht Frankfurt and St Pauli came to an end in 2003.

“I have to admit that that was quite big news,” he told the club’s official website of the reaction in China to his move.

“There aren’t many Chinese players playing in Europe, especially not in the five big leagues.

“I’ve quickly been put under great pressure by the media, friends, but also by people who I don’t know at all.

“Everyone suddenly thinks I’m the new hope of Chinese football, even though I don’t think that myself.”

Zhang is the only member of Marcello Lippi’s China squad playing professionally in Europe, with few Chinese players prepared to test themselves in the world’s top leagues.

He spent two seasons in the Netherlands before signing with West Bromwich and then heading to Germany due to British visa restrictions.

Zhang has played fewer than 10 full internationals for his country, with his most recent appearance coming in the 1-0 loss against Iran.

"Singapore cancels residence status of ‘US citizen’, says he worked for foreign power","(Representational Image) (Representational Image)

Singapore said on Friday it had cancelled the permanent residence status of a professor at a prominent postgraduate school whom it identified as a US citizen, and accused him of being an agent of influence for a foreign country. The Ministry of Home Affairs said Huang Jing, a professor of US-China relations at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, “knowingly interacted with intelligence organisations and agents of the foreign country” with the aim of bringing about a change in the direction of Singapore’s foreign policy.

The ruling, which also applied to Huang’s wife, Shirley Yang Xiuping, means that if they leave Singapore, they will not be readmitted. The ministry identified the couple as US citizens, but did not identify the country that Huang was alleged to have been working for.

A spokeswoman for the US State Department said it was aware of the Singapore announcement but declined further comment, citing privacy concerns. China’s foreign ministry said Beijing had no knowledge of Huang’s case. “We don’t understand the relevant situation,” the ministry told Reuters in a statement

Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post newspaper quoted Huang as denying the allegations. “It’s nonsense to identify me as ‘an agent of influence’ for a foreign country,” he said. “And why didn’t they identify which foreign country they’re referring to? Is it the US or China?”

Huang said he would seek help from his lawyer and the US embassy in Singapore. “My family and my home are all here. I have property in Singapore, too. How can they treat me like this? If they have evidence, they should take me to court,” said Huang, who was not given a deadline to leave the island state.

‘PRIVILEGED INFORMATION’

The home affairs ministry charged that Huang had used his position at the Lee Kwan Yew school “to deliberately and covertly advance the agenda of a foreign country at Singapore’s expense.” “He did this in collaboration with foreign intelligence agents,” it added.

The ministry said Huang and his wife could appeal, but if unsuccessful, would have to leave Singapore within a grace period. The university said it had suspended Huang without pay while it worked with the ministry on the matter.

“As these permits have been cancelled, we would not be able to continue with his employment,” it said in a statement, adding that it could not comment on the specifics of the case. The ministry said Huang had engaged with prominent and influential Singaporeans, giving them what he claimed to be “privileged information” about the foreign country with which he was interacting.

Such information was passed to a senior member of the Lee Kuan Yew School, who conveyed it to the Singapore government, which declined to act on it, the ministry said. Huang’s wife was aware of her husband’s actions and that he recruited others for his operations, it said.

Huang’s biography on the school’s website said he was previously a senior fellow at the John Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution and had advised exiled Tibetan leaders on China affairs. He is author of the books, “Factionalism in Chinese Communist Politics” and “Crisis and Challenges in US-China Relations.”

An opinion piece by Huang published in China’s Global Times this year titled “US domestic woes have global implications” said US President Donald Trump’s administration had eroded US power and soured relations with allies.

The column also said Chinese President Xi Jinping’s stress on economic globalisation and multilateralism “shows China’s sense of reasonability as an emerging major power”.

(Source: Instagram/alliaalrufai, aasthasharma612, gauaharkhan)

Earthy hues are not always easy to carry as a lot has to do with how the colour goes with your complexion. To find the perfect shade is a tedious task but trust celebs to show us inspiring ways on how to get it right. Recently, the beautiful trio, Anushka Sharma, Bhumi Pednekar and Gauahar Khan were seen dressed in earthy hues. It’s interesting to see how they kept their make-up really simple and understated to highlight their looks – now you know when to avoid bright make-up.

Let’s start with Anushka Sharma. The Jab Harry Met Sejal actor wore a raw silk kurta with matching palazzo pants, both from the label Urvashi Kaur.

As much as we like the outfit, we don’t like the patch of mustard on her bust glaring at us. The look would have been so much better without that pop of colour. You can make some modifications of your own if you like the A-line style.

Meanwhile, at the trailer launch of her upcoming film Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, Bhumi Pednekar looked pretty in a beautiful design from SVA by Sonam & Paras Modi.

We are glad that celebrity stylist Aastha Sharma picked up this longline embroidered tunic featuring split sleeves and the A-line skirt with scallop trim detailing at the hem. The styling was kept simple with earrings and a ring from Amrapali Jewels.

Last but not the least, Gauahar Khan was seen in a beautiful anarkali with lovely gold work on the bodice, sleeves and hemline from RAR Studio’s AW17 collection titled Baagicha.

The details on this one like the beautiful ruffles and pleated skirt are too good to miss. Celebrity stylist Aastha Sharma paired it well with the fusion diamond and jadau statement earrings from Anokkhi.

Which look would you pick? Let us know in the comments below.

Mexico has said it is willing to talk about tough issues in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is set to start on August 16. Canada has strongly opposed a US proposal to eliminate bi-national dispute resolution panels in which experts now review decisions to impose tariffs or quotas. But Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said he isn’t taking an immediate position on the panels, though he adds that Mexico wants to “modernise” the process.

“I don’t think that when you start negotiations, it does any good to shadow box,” Guajardo said, in refusing to fix an initial position. He said Mexico would be willing to put stronger labour and environmental guarantees in the text of NAFTA. The issues were previously relegated to weak “side agreements.”

Mexico also wants the energy sector included in the agreement. It wasn’t covered by the original 1994 trade pact between the three countries. Guajardo also made it clear that while Mexico wants talks on immigration issues, it won’t try to inject broader issues into NAFTA, but would rather focus on improving some kind of temporary visa program for workers.

The government said in a text of its negotiating goals that it wanted to “expand the categories for temporary visas for business people … and look for innovative mechanisms for the free movement of labour.” As for rules of origin — the regional content required for products to be considered “made in North America” –Guajardo said Mexico is open to “fine adjustment and constant dialogue.”

Twin Peaks: A small UP village has consistently seen surprisingly high number of twin births,"Mohammad Rehan and Mohammad Hassan in Mohammadpur Umri, Allahabad. (Source: Express Photo by Satyadeep Singh) Mohammad Rehan and Mohammad Hassan in Mohammadpur Umri, Allahabad. (Source: Express Photo by Satyadeep Singh)

Hassan, popularly called Chhote Guddu, recalls how a young girl used to throw her window open every morning just as he passed by her house, on his way to school. One Diwali, she called out to him, asking him to meet her at seven in the evening, when her parents wouldn’t be home. A few hours later she called out to him again, when he happened to walk past, informing him about a change in time. When he finally reached her place at 7 pm, she looked confused. She had already given him a box of sweets and a love letter an hour earlier.

Hassan knew at once. He went back to his neighbourhood where his twin, Rehan, better known as Bade Guddu, was flaunting a love letter and distributing sweets. The brothers went over to the girl’s house to clarify. She saw them both. And Hassan never saw her again.

Mohammadpur Umri, a small village in Uttar Pradesh near the Bamrauli Air Force base in Allahabad, is full of stories of mistaken identity. The village, with a population of roughly 700, boasts of over 35 pairs of twins. The world average, according to a 2006 World Health Organisation report and a 2013 US National Library of Medicine study is 9 to 12 per 1,000 births. Umri’s twin population average clocks up to 60 per 1,000.

“We are the oldest pair,” Hassan says, while his children giggle over stories of his younger days. Rehan, who lives nearby, walks up to us after a while. The infant mortality rate has improved, Rehan says, because of a fall in the number of home deliveries and a gradual increase in savings and wealth.

But Umri doesn’t have any viable explanation for the twin phenomenon. “Scientists came and collected our saliva and blood samples, soil and water samples too. They sampled the cattle because even bovines here tend to give birth to twins. But the scientists never got back,” says Farhat, a 22-year-old, whose twin, Nighar, was married off a few years ago. “When they don’t know, how are we supposed to?”

Mohammad Abzal and Iziba in Mohammadpur Umri, Allahabad. (Source: Express Photo by Satyadeep Singh) Mohammad Abzal and Iziba in Mohammadpur Umri, Allahabad. (Source: Express Photo by Satyadeep Singh)

Many from neighbouring villages believe that Umri is haunted. Many believe radiation from the airbase nearby causes the zygote to split into two. But Umri residents rubbish such claims. “There are airbases everywhere in the world but there are no such cases. The only thing we can say for sure is that these are blessings from god,” Noorista, Farhat’s mother, says.

A team of scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, which visited Umri 15 years ago, could never complete its study for unspecified reasons. GR Chandak, group leader at the CCMB, who led the team in 2002, said, “We collected samples from Umri. We also conducted a sociological survey with the help of The Indian Society for Social Research. We had set out to study the genetic basis of the phenomenon of twinning.” But the study never got completed because of several “complications”, says Chandak. “The village did not have electricity and other basic amenities, and its residents were resentful about no one coming to improve their living conditions. Many twins had married and left the village. Many had died at birth,” he says.

Umri residents got access to electricity only a few years ago. A primary and middle school came up around the same time. “But there are no medicine shops or hospitals. The nearest hospital is around five kilometres away. We also need piped water supply,” Mohammad Umar, the pradhan of the village, says.

In such a bleak scenario, Amit and Vipin, the 22-year-old brothers who play in the Allahabad Cricket League, feel that sports “is one of the last priorities of our governments.” There is genuine dismay over the future of their cricketing dreams — their parents are vegetable vendors who try to make ends meet. But the brothers try to make light of the situation by talking about the comedy of errors which ensues in most of their matches.

Five years ago, they say, in a match against Fatehpur, Amit, was bowled out on 33. When it was Vipin’s turn to bat (he usually bowls), Amit went out to bat again instead. “It was a summer’s day. We were wearing similar vests and we looked exactly the same. No one ever knew and we ended up winning the match,” says Vipin with a laugh.

Haroon Khimani might be an octogenarian but it has not lessened his love for art. The 81-year-old — who always seeks to discover the beauty of nature, mostly in collapsed structures and disasters, be it natural or man-made — will soon showcase his latest contemporary retrospective visual arts exhibition titled ‘Descent’ in Mumbai. His paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation, steeped into potential energy of rebuilding.

“There is an ethical side to nature which borders between ‘being’ and ‘nothingness’. That inspires me the most. For the artist, it is a chance to step inside their own creations, to appear in a visual story and establish an interaction. Creating a super sensual existence on the canvass is an intense personal experience. In my paintings you will see nature acts as a backdrop that determines human fate. Everything is in a flux. Ultimately the desperate elements form a whole and add to the tempo of narrative,” Khimani said in a statement.

The veteran artist, has earlier stated on his website, “Beauty has a new definition for me. My paintings look like landscapes but there is unusual magnitude of structural juxtaposition, depth, recession and space created by colours perceived through black and white tones. We all are habituated to see beauty in limited terms but in disorganised and chaotic nature new beauty forms are created by self-destruction of the existing structures. Nature does this wonderfully but it depends upon our outlook to see the beauty in it. In fact, at such junctures we are emotionally driven to sympathy towards sufferers and dislocated mass, which leads us to see the pathetic and helpless part of it rather than the aesthetic value.”

"Ram Jethmalani gone, Arvind Kejriwal seeks time to find ‘proper representation’, court shoots down request","Ram Jethmalani (L) alleged Arvind Kejriwal (R) had given him instructions to use the ‘objectionable words’ in court Ram Jethmalani (L) alleged Arvind Kejriwal (R) had given him instructions to use the ‘objectionable words’ in court

A city court Saturday rejected a plea by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal seeking adjournment of the criminal defamation case filed against him by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. The CM had said he was left without ‘proper representation’ after senior counsel Ram Jethmalani refused to represent him. Meanwhile, during the recording of his statement, Jaitley said that Kejriwal’s allegations on ‘irregularities in DDCA’ had “severely impacted my reputation”.

The plea was moved by the CM’s counsel Shadan Farasat, who requested Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Sumit Dass for a “short accommodation”. In response, Jaitley’s lawyer Sidharth Luthra made his submission to the court, stating, “They (Kejriwal and others) choose to spar with their lawyer, which is no ground for adjournment… even the law says no adjournment except ‘beyond your control’ and it cannot be sought because of unavailability of a senior counsel.”

Kejriwal and Jethmalani had a falling out over the use of the term ‘crook’ for Jaitley in court. After Kejriwal said he never instructed Jethmalani to use the word in court, the lawyer alleged the CM had “used worse abuses” for the Union minister. The senior counsel later said he will never appear for Kejriwal in any matter.

During arguments Saturday, Luthra also told the court, “They (AAP leaders) are acting together in defaming, and today they are acting together in delaying.” Kejriwal and other AAP leaders had accused Jaitley of financial irregularities in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), of which he was president from 2000 to 2013. This prompted the minister to lodge defamation cases against them.

Apart from Kejriwal, accused AAP leaders — Ashutosh, Kumar Vishwas and Sanjay Singh — also sought adjournment on the ground that their lawyers were unwell. Two other AAP leaders named in the case are Raghav Chadha and Deepak Bajpai. Their plea was rejected by the court, which went ahead with the recording of Jaitley’s statement. However, it granted exemption to Kejriwal from making a personal appearance.

Jaitley said that matters related to the financials of the DDCA were handled by the treasurer. “The allegations that I have been responsible for embezzling of funds for construction of the stadium are false. Neither I dealt with the financials, nor have I accepted any amount from DDCA either directly or indirectly. I never even charged money that I personally incurred…,” said Jaitley.

He also said that the accused had alleged an association between him and a company, run by one Lokesh Sharma from the association. “Neither me, nor my children have any connection with the company… It (the allegations) adversely impacted my reputation. Several of my friends and well wishers spoke to me to inquire about the veracity of the accusation,” he said.

Suffering from lower back pain? A new smart underwear may help,"The wearable device consists of two fabric sections, made of nylon canvas, Lycra, polyester and other materials, for the chest and legs. (File Photo) The wearable device consists of two fabric sections, made of nylon canvas, Lycra, polyester and other materials, for the chest and legs. (File Photo)

Scientists have developed a smart, mechanised undergarment that can help reduce stress and pain on the lower back muscles. Engineers at the Vanderbilt University in the US combined biomechanics and advances in wearable technology to create the undergarment. Over half of all adults will experience low back pain in their lifetimes, researchers said. The wearable device consists of two fabric sections, made of nylon canvas, Lycra, polyester and other materials, for the chest and legs.

The sections are connected by sturdy straps across the middle back, with natural rubber pieces at the lower back and glutes. The device is designed so that users engage it only when they need it. A simple double tap to the shirt engages the straps. When the task is done, another double tap releases the straps so the user can sit down, and the device feels and behaves like normal clothes. The device also can be controlled by an app that the team created users tap their phones to engage the smart clothing wirelessly via Bluetooth.

Eight subjects tested the device leaning forward and lifting weights while holding their position at 30, 60 and 90 degrees. Using motion capture, force plates and electromyography, researchers showed that the device reduced activity in the lower back extensor muscles by an average of 15-45 per cent for each task. The team’s testing proved that the smart clothing offloads stress on the low back. The focus of the technology is not to treat those with existing back pain but to prevent it by reducing stress and fatigue on the low back muscles.

Amit Bhattacharyya’s appendix lists the names of 439 women killed in the course of India’s Maoist movements. They have died at the hands of security forces and anti-Maoist vigilante groups supported by the ruling classes, like the Ranvir Sena of Bihar, which includes upper castes. They also use rape, a weapon that runs a knife through the heart of society. The politics of Ram and Rahim may kill more, but the Maoist movement has been more resilient in India than the mandir-masjid battle. Even the current ruling party in West Bengal had tied up with them at a subterranean level to liberate the people from the void of governance under the CPI(M). Trinamool Congress chairperson and chief minister Mamata Bannerjee found an accord with the CPI(Maoist) expedient, following the Arthashastra: “The enemy of my enemy is my friend.’

That the unnatural coalition was only a means was inscribed in bold relief when the Americans recognised it first. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had visited Kolkata to congratulate the new chief minister, the communist slayer. But a few years later her nephew, a neophyte, described the “encounter” killing of a Maoist motormouth, Kishenji, as an extrajudicial killing.

Prof Amit Bhattacharyya, a historian at Jadavpur University, had the honour of being named in a public meeting by Mamata Banerjee as one who abetted Maoism. He survived to tell this tale. His book’s biggest failure is a conflation of Naxalism — named after the Naxalbari movement of 1967 — with the much larger footprint of the Maoist movement that refuses to die down. The politics of the Indian communist movement is not linear like in China, where nationalism had created the biggest popular mobilisation, led jointly by Mao Zhedong and his Red Army, along with nationalist forces inspired by Sun Yat Sen’s ideology of a China free from Japanese and British imperialism. Led by ‘Generalissimo’ Chiang Kai-shek, the nationalist forces turned their guns on the Red Army. The massacre of Jiangxi forced the Red Army into the strategic withdrawal called the Long March, and finally Chiang’s forces were routed in a civil war in 1949.

Besides, this chronicle begins in 1972, marked by the death in judicial custody of Charu Mazumdar, a former zonal committee member of the CPI(M) in north Bengal who walked out of the party in 1969 to form the CPI (Marxist-Leninist). It held its first party congress in 1970, rather dramatically disguised as a wedding event. His party had attracted largely the urban youth of what Suniti Kumar Ghosh — sort of an ideologue of the party — identified as the ‘upper, middle and lower’ bourgeoisie. Ghosh himself had remained controversial within the ranks of the fractious CPI(ML).

Mao had sent even the youth of Zhongnanhai — the large compound across Tienanmen Square where the high functionaries of the Communist Party of China (CPC) live — to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution. President Xi Jinping is one of those ‘sent down’ youths. Mazumdar’s youth cadres had aunts and uncles in the West. After selective jail terms they all got a second shot in life once they emigrated. Except those who had what was commonly called the Fourth Tribunal cases, most of them were released in 1977-78 in a general amnesty declared by Chaudhury Charan Singh, then Union Home Minister.

The Tudus and Murmus, tribal sons of the soil, are rather different. They have somewhat taken over the Maoist movement after the first flush of Operation Greenhunt, which decimated the Andhra-based leadership of the CPI(Maoist). Barring Comrade ‘Ganapathy’, general secretary of the newly reconstituted party, the tribal leaders and their cadres are putting up a stiff resistance to the extent that prime minister Manmohan Singh identified them as “the single biggest threat to the nation”.

This resistance at Vedanta’s Niyamgiri and at sites of planned nuclear plants amidst rural, populated regions, constitute a people’s movement often organised by the Maoists. This could be the seed of a ‘new left’ movement that would not need a Bhattacharyya or a Kobad Gandhi to lionise, but would address objective realities through peaceful civil disobedience. Increasingly, they will ask political power what development is, and for whom it is. Tough questions, those.

Haryana BJP chief’s son held for ‘stalking’ daughter of IAS officer,"The vehicle used by him to ‘chase’ the woman. (Source: Express Photo) The vehicle used by him to ‘chase’ the woman. (Source: Express Photo)

Haryana state BJP chief Subhash Barala’s son Vikas Barala and his friend Ashish Kumar were arrested on Saturday after the daughter of a senior IAS officer accused the two of stalking, wrongful restraint and driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol.

After a day-long flip-flop on the charges to include in the FIR, the Chandigarh police eventually charged Vikas and Ashish with bailable offences, under the IPC and Motor Vehicles Act, and they were released in the evening. Both the Haryana-cadre IAS officer, and his daughter, 29, a disc jockey, uploaded an account of her “horrific” experience on their Facebook accounts. In his Facebook post, the officer expressed the apprehension that the accused may go unpunished as they were from influential families, and hoped this would not happen.

The woman said that Vikas and Ashish followed her around for nearly 30 minutes as she drove home around midnight Friday, blocked her car repeatedly and tried to open her door. The victim was alone, driving from Sector 8 in Chandigarh to her home in Sector 6 Panchkula. According to the FIR, Vikas and Ashish spotted the woman near a fuel station and started following her. She was allegedly chased for nearly 7 km before police, reacting to a call made by her, caught the two. On medical examination, both were reportedly found to be drunk.

DSP Satish Kumar said, “The accused had purchased two cans of beer and consumed it while driving the Safari that belongs to Vikas’s relative. They kept following the woman and blocked her way several times. The woman called the Police Control Room at about 12.35 am and within 10 minutes, the accused were caught. Later, after receiving a formal complaint, we registered a criminal case against both of them and arrested them. Since the charges against them were bailable, both were released on bail.”

Preliminary investigations revealed that Vikas, who is a student of LLB in Kurukshetra University, was driving the vehicle. Ashish, a law graduate, was sitting beside him in the front. A resident of Fatehabad, Ashish had come to Chandigarh about a week ago. As news came of Vikas’s arrest, the Opposition demanded his father’s resignation. However, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, answering media’s queries at a public event, said, “This is not an issue of Subhash Barala but of a specific individual. Whatever action would be required against him, law would take its course.”

Talking to The Sunday Express, the woman said, “I am thankful to the Chandigarh police for promptly responding to my call. This could have gone worse.” Describing Friday night’s incident, she wrote on Facebook, “Was almost kidnapped on a Chandigarh road last night”. “There were 2 guys inside the SUV, and they seemed to really be enjoying harassing a lone girl in the middle of the night.”

Describing her condition, she wrote, “My hands shaking, my back spasming (sic) from fear, half in tears, half bewildered, because I didn’t know if I’d make it home tonight.” She added, “If this is what women deal with in one of the safer cities in the country, where are we going? I find it shocking, that in a place with cameras at every light and cops every 200 metres, these boys thought they could either get into my car, or take me into theirs, just because they’re from an influential background. I’m lucky, it seems, to not be the daughter of a common man, because what chance would they have against such VIPs? I’m also lucky, because I’m not lying raped and murdered in a ditch somewhere.”

Her father wrote, “As a father of two daughters, I feel compelled to take this matter to its logical conclusion. The goons must be punished, and the law must take its course. As would be expected, the goons are from influential families. We all know most such cases of harassment go unpunished and even unreported. Most people would not want or dare to take on goons from influential families. I feel if people with some privileges like us cannot stand up to such criminals, nobody in India can. More importantly, I will be failing in my duty as a father to my daughter if I did not stand with her completely in this matter.”

He added, “I am sharing this with you all for two reasons. One, to give a true and clear picture of what happened. Two, to get some assurance of support in case it’s needed. Our clear intention is to bring the culprits to book. We do not intend to harm the families or relatives. However, we know it’s not going to be an easy struggle. The possibility of harassment and witch-hunting, threats and even physical harm is undeniable, even though unlikely. Influential families can sometimes take desperate measures to discredit or disable the complainants. Sane friends may advise us against… action. We may be foolhardy. However, I know that the trauma and hurt my daughter has undergone cannot be undone. If we do not persist in trying to bring the guilty to justice, more and more daughters will suffer this hurt. Maybe some may not be as lucky as (my daughter). Someone has to stand up. We are standing. So long as we can.”

Now the cows are home,"Cows on the loose in Ghuwara village of Chhatarpur district (Source: Express Photo/Milind Ghatwai) Cows on the loose in Ghuwara village of Chhatarpur district (Source: Express Photo/Milind Ghatwai)

Nestled along a rocky hillock in Tikamgarh, this small village of about a thousand residents follows a fixed ritual at twilight. Before retiring for the day, the men of Dumbar herd cows wandering in the village’s lanes into a makeshift enclosure, praying they won’t venture out at night. The cows don’t belong to them. The villagers don’t know who owns them either. The animals started appearing a few months ago, climbing over the hillock and destroying their fields.

“The owners abandon them in the dark and they amble towards the village during the day,” rues Lakhan Pal, who tills five acres along with three brothers, and owns three cows of his own. Lamenting the damage caused to his fields where he grows black gram, he says, “Gai ki koi value nahin hai (The cow has no value).”

Dumbar is better off than neighbouring Chandooli and Pratappura, part of the same panchayat, which have no enclosures to hold the stray cows. “We simply chase them from one field to another,” says sarpanch Udham Yadav. The abandoned cows have become a source of friction in the villages, the 40-year-old adds. Recently, a farmer belonging to the dominant Brahmin caste in Dumbar village killed a cow after it entered his field.

Mohan Tiwari, who is in his 20s, has been arrested under the anti-cow slaughter Act, besides Section 429 of the IPC (causing mischief by killing or maiming a cattle). Villagers say Tiwari went twice for a dip in the Ganga and held a puja, to “wash away his sins”. His father Bhumani Maharaj pleads to be left alone. Shankar Ahirwar, a Dalit whose cow was killed by Tiwari, says he had let it loose “because everyone does so during the day”. He also wonders, “I don’t know what would have happened had I killed a cow belonging to a Brahmin.” Though Ahirwar’s nine-acre fields sown with black gram are neatly fenced, cows keep making their way in.

The growing problem of abandoned cows in the state was discussed in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly on July 21, with MLAs seeking immediate intervention. MLAs of the ruling BJP led the debate, regretting that cows were now being abandoned for good unlike earlier when owners would let loose their cattle post-harvest and later get them back in a practice often called “era pratha”. During the debate, BJP MLA from Susner, Murlidhar Patidar, suggested that BPL families be asked to rear a cow each as they benefit from government schemes.

Slamming gau bhakts, BJP MLA from Chandla R D Prajapati said, “They keep shouting ‘cow is our mother’. When I ask them have you ever reared one… (they say) ‘not cow, but buffalo is our mother’!” Prajapati also told the House there were 20,000 stray cattle in his constituency. “Let there be no development in my constituency, but please manage (the problem of) stray cows,” he said. Bharatiya Kisan Sangh leader Shivkant Dixit says 35 to 40 of Madhya Pradesh’s 51 districts are affected by the problem of stray cows. One solution, he adds, is ensuring demand for cow milk, as well as its urine and dung.

The state’s ‘Kanji’ houses, where impounded cattle are kept till reclaimed by owners, have also collapsed under the weight of unwanted animals. Madhya Pradesh has had a cow slaughter prohibition law (Madhya Pradesh Gauvansh Pratishedh Adhiniyam) since 2004, when the BJP was voted into power. An amendment cleared in 2012 by the President puts the onus on the accused in a cow slaughter case, while raising the punishment for killing a cow from three years to seven.

Cow vigilante groups like the Bajrang Sena admit an increase in the number of cows on the streets, and take pride in it being a result of “our campaign”. They say few dare buy or transport cattle for slaughter now. On a rainy day, a Bajrang Sena activist, Shivam Asati, stands at Baldeogarh Police Station near Dumbar, next to a dumper that has killed a buffalo. “I know it’s the buffalo’s fault, but now that it is dead, the driver has to pay a price,” says Asati. He demands Rs 40,000.

Tribal activist Anurag Modi says the anti-cow slaughter Act, coupled with cow vigilantism, has destroyed the rural economy. “Tribals used to buy young animals from weekly markets and sell them. They have stopped doing so due to fear of gau rakshaks and police, who are hand in glove with them.” So far though, says the president of the Pithampur Industries’ Association, Gautam Kothari, the campaign has not impacted the leather industry.

Khargapur Congress MLA Chanda Surendra Singh Gaur calls the problem “very acute”. “Every day I negotiate 10-odd cows squatting near my house. The government pats itself on the back in the name of gau mata but does little to improve its lot.” “Every night over a hundred cows squat on roads near our village,” adds Chandrabhan Yadav, a young farmer of Pratappura. Bikers have to be cautious, he says, especially due to fear of cow vigilantes in case of any accident.

In a village 20 km from Dumbar, Bhura Bhanjan sits next to his field, lush green after the rains, with a stone in his hand. The good monsoon should have left him happy, says the 40-year-old. Instead, he spends his days guarding his field against stray cows. No matter how many he chases into the nearby forest, he says, there is a new herd the next day.

The other reason cows are entering fields is shortage of fodder, both due to extensive use of harvesters and encroachment on traditional grazing land. BJP MLA from Tikamgarh K K Shrivastava blames the previous Congress government, which last ruled 14 years ago. “Earlier 10 per cent of the total land used to be reserved as gauchar land. By the time the Congress lost power, the grazing land had come down to just 2 per cent,” he says.

Contrary to the stand of Sangh Parivar organisations, Shrivastava believes cross-breeding with foreign varieties could be one way to keep the desi breeds alive, as that would increase their milk yield and keep them productive. There is anyway little use for male calves and bulls because tractors are now used to plough fields.

In the Assembly debate, the MLAs said creating more gaushalas could be a solution. Dumbar has two within a 30-km distance. In Kharagpur, around 1 pm on a Thursday, there is just one cow in a facility meant to accommodate hundreds. Rajnish Thakur, who runs the gaushala, admits that he has let the others out to graze, and that the cows would return at night.

Thakur claims farmers force him to accept their cows even when he runs out of space. He says he doesn’t depend on the slow-moving government grant of Rs 1 lakh a year, and spends nearly Rs 2.5 lakh on fodder etc. The other gaushala, in Papora village, 5 km from Tikamgarh, is run by the Jain community. “We get old, injured and sick cows because no one wants them,” says Jalam Prasad Ahirwar, who believes the vigilantism of gau rakshaks is directly responsible for the rise in the number of cows at his gaushala.

The grant of the Madhya Pradesh Gausamvardhan Board (cow protection board) was increased to Rs 25 crore per year recently, from Rs 20 crore. But the board wants nearly Rs 100 crore, so as to enable it to spend Rs 10 per cow per day from the present Rs 2.90. The board has also suggested that the government build a gauthan (a place for cows to rest in) in clusters of four to five gram panchayats each, and to bring works related to gaushalas under the ambit of the MNREGS.

Swami Akhileshwaranand Giri, who heads the Gausamvardhan Board, talks proudly about “the country’s first cow sanctuary” for strays, being built for the past five years, at Salaria in Agar district. The BJP government has meanwhile promised another one, in Rewa.

The Managing Director of the MP Livestock and Poultry Development Corporation, Dr H B S Bhadoria, is also counting on ‘UID (unique identity)’. Under the Rs 13-crore project — jointly funded by the Centre and state — each of the 90 lakh milch animals in the state are getting a polyurethane tag with a 12-digit UID number punched into their ears.

Tamil Thalaivas scored 23 points in a single half against Bengaluru Bulls. But that came on the back of a first half performance so bad that they ended up losing the match by a point.

The Thalaivas were bossed by Bengaluru Bulls in the first half. They forced two all outs and seldom gave any points away while defending. This meant that the final score at the end of the match was 32-31 in favour of the Bulls.

Bulls eventually defeated Thalaivas 32-31.

In the second encounter Puneri Paltan won the match 26-21 against Dabang Delhi."
Eating chocolate may provide relief from bowel disease,"ThinkStock Images ThinkStock Images

Consuming protein rich foods such as nuts, eggs, seeds, beans, poultry, yogurt, cheese and even chocolates may foster a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment, which could mean relief for people living with abdominal pain and diarrhoea of inflammatory bowel disease, a study has said.

These food items contain an appreciable amounts of tryptophan — an amino acid used in the buildup of proteins — which when fed on mice led to the development of immune cells that foster a tolerant gut, the study said. The findings indicated that a protein rich diet triggers the appearance of immune cells in Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) — a bacterium that normally lives in the gut, and together these promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut immune system.

“We established a link between one bacterial species — Lactobacillus reuteri — that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and development of a population of cells that promote tolerance,” said Marco Colonna, the Robert Rock Belliveau, Professor at the Washington University School of Medicine in St.Louis. “The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had,” Belliveau added.

For the study, published in the journal Science, the team examined mice that had lived under sterile conditions since birth and was germ-free. When L. reuteri was introduced to these mice, the immune cells arose. Further, when tryptophan was doubled in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 per cent.

Humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and have L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tracts. “The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines,” explained Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, Postdoctoral researcher from the varsity.

“High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population,” Cervantes-Barragan said.

Paul Kagame poised for third-term win in Rwanda election,"Rwandan President Paul Kagame of the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) waves to his supporters during his final campaign rally in Kigali, Rwanda August 2, 2017.

REUTERS/Jean Bizimana

Rwandans vote in a presidential election today widely expected to return strongman Paul Kagame to office for a third seven-year term at the helm of the small east African nation. Kagame, 59, is facing two little-known candidates who have made little impact in only three weeks of campaigning against the incumbent and his all-powerful Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).

Tens of thousands of cheering supporters, waving little red, white and blue flags, feted Kagame at his final rally Wednesday, praising the man who halted the 1994 genocide and has been de-facto leader of Rwanda ever since.

“I support President Kagame because he stopped the genocide and because he brought development to Rwanda,” said supporter Ngendahimana Narcisse.

Another backer, Mukashimyirimiza Zainabu, said Kagame had “built schools, he’s provided healthcare, roads, electricity so we’re really behind him.”

In contrast, only a few hundred people have attended the rallies of Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green Party — the only permitted critical opposition party — and independent candidate Philippe Mpayimana.

The opponents have complained about the limited time given to fundraise and campaign, which critics see as further evidence of Kagame’s clampdown on the opposition.

“It is short, we would have liked at least two months. Towards the end of the campaign the number of people at our rallies increased a lot,” said Jean-Claude Ntezimana, the executive secretary of the Green Party.

Habineza told AFP at a recent rally that putting up banners and posters had also been a challenge.

“They told us we cannot put our banners or flags where the RPF’s things are, but unfortunately the RPF put theirs almost everywhere,” he said.

Kagame’s election is seen as assured after 98 percent of Rwandans approved a constitutional amendment in a 2015 referendum that granted him the right to run for a third term in office. Observers condemned the reform, which could potentially see Kagame seek re-election twice more and remain in office until 2034.

Kagame, a lanky former guerrilla fighter, was just 36 when his rebel army routed extremist Hutu forces who slaughtered an estimated 800,000 people — mainly minority Tutsis — and seized Kigali.

He served first as vice-president and defence minister, although he was widely considered the de facto leader of the country and was appointed as president by lawmakers in 2000.

He was first elected to the post in 2003 and again in 2010 with more than 90 per cent of votes.

He is credited with a remarkable turnaround in the shattered nation, bringing stability and annual economic growth of about seven percent.

However, rights groups accuse him of ruling through fear, relying on a systematic repression of the opposition, free speech and the media.

Critics have been assassinated, jailed or forced into exile, and some observers believe the only reason Habineza and Mpayimana have been allowed to run is that they pose no threat.

“There is no election in Rwanda, there is a coronation declaring Kagame the king,” outspoken local journalist Robert Mugabe told AFP.

Mumbai: BMC catches dumpers mixing solid waste with debris to show higher weight,"Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recently caught several dumpers bringing in solid waste mixed with debris to show an increased weight of the garbage. (Express Archive) Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recently caught several dumpers bringing in solid waste mixed with debris to show an increased weight of the garbage. (Express Archive)

In a bid to crack down on malpractices in the management of solid waste in the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recently caught several dumpers bringing in solid waste mixed with debris to show an increased weight of the garbage. Officials from the solid waste management department detected the malpractice by secretly videographing the vehicles while they were unloading the waste at the garbage collection stations.

Civic officials from the Solid Waste Management (SWM) department said that the decision to film them without their knowledge was taken amid rumours of garbage vehicles dumping solid waste mixed with debris. Additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal said, “We videographed the dumpers unloading solid waste for three days and found that the waste was being mixed with debris to increase the weight of the load. We have stopped this kind of malpractice now and will take appropriate action against the contractors involved.”

As per the tender conditions, the contractors employed at the four refuse stations are paid on the basis of weight of the garbage collected from various locations in the city. As part of the Vehicular Tracking System, the trucks are weighed at the entrance of the refuse stations and they are given a receipt for every trip each makes. Another civic official said that the video surveillance was taken up at all the four refuse transfer stations in the city. “The action was taken based on footage of three days. We then questioned the drivers and traced the areas they collect solid waste from. We are also questioning the contractors and are still monitoring the feed to ensure that the dumper drivers are not repeating the act of mixing garbage with debris,” said the official.

Senior civic officials added that by preventing dumpers from using debris to show a heavier amount of solid waste, there has been a difference in the total weight of waste produced by the city. “There is a drop in the city’s daily output of solid waste and we can further reduce the figure by detecting such methods of cheating coupled with measures for decentralised processing of waste. Today it stands at 7,850 metric tonne a day and we hope that we can further reduce this figure to 7,500 metric tonnes in the next 10 days,” said Singhal.

He added that in the plan of implementing reservations commonly mentioned in the development plan 1991 as well as the DP 2034 which is pending approval of the state government, several plots in the eastern suburbs have been marked as segregation centres. “There are around 60 reservations which are on municipal plots in six wards and many of them will be used for dry waste segregation centres apart from schools, welfare centres and markets. The list has been sent out to nine departments and they are preparing the estimate for the tenders which are expected to be floated in another 2-3 weeks,” said Singhal.

SWM officials said that the refuse transfer stations will now be completely computerised for better vigilance of dumpers bringing in waste. “We are trying to ensure that the information of the waste being brought to the stations is automatic and can be calculated on a regular basis so that we can get the information on an SMS every day,” said the official.

The SWM department took up extensive measures to force residential societies to segregate wet waste from dry waste after they were pulled up by the Bombay High Court last year due to poor management of the city’s solid waste. Apart from encouraging residential societies, office complexes and schools to set up composting pits, they have made it compulsory for the bulk generators including hotels and gymkhanas to process their own waste at site. The BMC has issued notices to 3,284 bulk generators which contribute around 1,300 metric tonne to the city’s total waste output making it mandatory for them to segregate and process their own waste.

"From Monster to Magic, Neymarketing goes global","Neymar grew on the international stage and happily assumed the captain’s role. (Source: AP) Neymar grew on the international stage and happily assumed the captain’s role. (Source: AP)

Many young players from Brazil – particularly those starting out at Santos – have been saddled with the moniker, “the new Pele”. Few of them have handled the pressure or come as close to fulfilling the prophecy as well as Neymar.

With an infectious grin, a series of flamboyant haircuts, and an abundance of talent, the teenage Neymar stood out from the moment he burst onto the scene at Santos in 2009. Within three years of making his debut for the Sao Paulo club, he had led them to their first Copa Libertadores in almost 50 years, won the Puskas award for the FIFA goal of the season, and pinned down a regular spot in the national side.

His ball skills and poise in front of goal made him a top target for European clubs, and Barcelona signed him in 2013.

Supremely confident even as a teenager, Neymar was not overawed at playing alongside the likes of Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez.

In four years in Catalonia, he did all there was to do with Barca, winning the Champions League once, La Liga twice, and the Copa del Rey three times. He was even more feted at international level, where Brazil coaches Dunga and Tite built their teams around his brilliance.

Neymar grew on the international stage and happily assumed the captain’s role, most notably at the 2016 Olympics when he led Brazil to their first-ever soccer gold – scoring a sublime free kick and the deciding penalty in the process. The responsibility came easy to him and it was no coincidence that Brazil’s 7-1 defeat by Germany in the 2014 World Cup came when he was out injured.

He goes to Paris eager to take on a similarly pivotal role, and he appears ready. Now 25, he is no longer the player whose arrogant tantrums and overdone theatrics prompted one rival manager to call him “a monster.” But while there is little doubt he is good enough to lead a team on the field, his move to centre stage will also bring him attention off it.

Led by his father and agent, Neymar Sr, he has faced a host of court cases in Spain and Brazil over what investors, former clubs and tax authorities contend are contractual jiggery-pokery. He has won some of the cases but still faces charges in others. A complex multi-million dollar transfer deal will be sure to throw up more questions and test the mettle – or the lawyers – of a man whose devotion to the bottom line earned him the name Neymarketing.

"Three years since Islamic State attack, Yazidi wounds still open","Nearly 3,000 Yazidi women and children remain in Islamic State captivity, and control over Sinjar is disputed by rival armed factions and their regional patrons. (Representational photo) Nearly 3,000 Yazidi women and children remain in Islamic State captivity, and control over Sinjar is disputed by rival armed factions and their regional patrons.

Iraq’s Yazidis marked three years since Islamic State launched what the United Nations said was a genocidal campaign against them on Thursday, but their ordeal is far from over despite the ouster of the jihadist fighters.

Militants were driven out of the last part of the Yazidi homeland in northern Iraq in May. However, most Yazidis have yet to return to villages they fled when Islamic State over-ran Sinjar in the summer of 2014, killing and capturing thousands because of their faith.

Nearly 3,000 Yazidi women and children remain in Islamic State captivity, and control over Sinjar is disputed by rival armed factions and their regional patrons. Justice for the crimes Yazidis suffered, including sexual enslavement, has also so far proved elusive.

“The Yazidis’ wound is still bleeding,” one man told Reuters at a ceremony attended by several thousand people including the mayor and other local dignitaries, held at a temple at the foot of the mountain that dominates Sinjar.

“The Kurds and the Iraqi government are fighting for Sinjar and we are paying the price,” said the man.

A UN human rights Commission of Inquiry, which declared the killings of thousands of Yazidis to be a genocide, said on Thursday that the atrocity had not ended and that the international community was not doing enough to stop it.

“The genocide is on-going and remains largely unaddressed, despite the obligation of States… to prevent and to punish the crime,” the commissioners said in a statement.

Islamic State fighters killed thousands of captured men during their attack on the Yazidis, a religious sect whose beliefs combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions. Islamic State considers Yazidis as devil-worshippers.

Images of desperate Yazidis fleeing up the mountain in the blazing summer heat were broadcast around the world and helped to galvanise the United States to conduct its first air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq.

At least 9,900 of Iraq’s Yazidis were killed or kidnapped in just days in the Islamic State attack in 2014, according to a study documenting the number of Yazidis affected which could be used as evidence in any trial for genocide.

About 3,100 Yazidis were killed – with more than half shot, beheaded or burned alive – and about 6,800 kidnapped to become sex slaves or fighters, according to the report published in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Medicine.

Enslaved women and girls are now reportedly being sold by Islamic State fighters trying to escape the U.S.-led assault on their Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, the U.N. commission said.

DISPUTE OVER SINJAR

The array of forces that drove Islamic State out of Sinjar are now vying for control of the area near the borders of Iraq, Syria and Turkey.

Kurdish peshmerga forces retook around half of Sinjar in late 2015, effectively annexing it to the autonomous region they hope to convert into an independent state. A referendum on independence is due to be held in September, which the government in Baghdad opposes.

Mainly Shi’ite paramilitary groups, some backed by Iran, retook the rest of the Yazidi homeland in May, bringing them within metres of the peshmerga.

Another group, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), also gained a foothold in Sinjar and clashed with the peshmerga earlier this year. Its presence has made the area a target for Turkey, which has fought a three-decade war against the PKK on its own soil.

“People are worried about returning,” said General Ashti Kojer, the local head of Kurdish police, known as Asayish. “The (Sinjar) region has become a conflict zone”.

Kojer and another local official said the political environment was preventing international organisations from working on reconstruction and rehabilitation in Sinjar, further discouraging Yazidis from returning.

Water has to be trucked in, electricity is supplied from private generators, schools are closed, and the closest hospital is Dohuk — around three hours’ drive away.

“The lack of services and political problems are preventing families from returning,” Jalal Khalaf, the director of the mayor’s office in Sinjar, told Reuters.

BLAME GAME

In a speech at the ceremony, the Yazidi mayor of Sinjar, Mahma Xelil, said former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was responsible for the tragedy because he was in charge when the militants overran Mosul, capturing billions of dollars of weapons they used in their attack on the minority.

Other Yazidis blame the Kurds, who were defending the area at the time, for failing to resist the IS onslaught.

At the ceremony, people carried signs saying “Stop Yazidi Genocide”. Families streamed into cemeteries to remember their loved ones. Women wore bandanas saying “Genocide”.

In the city of Sinjar, posters and banners hung up on roundabouts depict harrowing scenes from the attack three years ago: families fleeing and distressed women and children.

Large parts of the city, which was also home to Muslim Kurds and Arabs, remain empty. Around 1,000 Yazidi families have returned to Sinjar since the city was retaken in 2015, according to Khalaf. The city and the surrounding area had been home to around 400,000 Yazidis.

Farhan Lazgin brought his family back to Sinjar around one year ago because he was fed up with living in a camp.

His home was in relatively good shape, but his two children have missed out on a year of school, and may fall further behind because teachers are not returning to the city.

Zeido Shammo, one of the few shopowners to have returned to the city, said he no longer trusted local forces: “We ask for international protection,” he said, echoing the sentiment of many Yazidis.

Although Islamic State has been routed from the area, Shammo said he could not feel safe until their hardline ideology was eradicated too: “Daesh (Islamic State) is defeated but we are still worried because the mentality of Daesh still exists.”

Opposite his shop, Islamic State slogans have yet to be painted over. One reads: “The State of the Caliphate Remains”.

IAAF rebuff Usain Bolt blocks criticism,"Usain Bolt is seeking his fourth gold in the event. (Source: Reuters) Usain Bolt is seeking his fourth gold in the event. (Source: Reuters)

World Athletics Championships organisers rebuffed criticism from Usain Bolt about his starting blocks in the 100 metres on Saturday, insisting they had been checked and were the same model used in Beijing two years ago.

Bolt, who will seek to finish his matchless individual sprint career with a 100m gold medal in the London Stadium on Saturday night, was, unusually for him, highly critical of the blocks after his sluggish performance in Friday’s first round.

“That was very bad,” he told reporters after recovering from a dismal start to win his heat in 10.07 seconds.

“I stumbled a little bit coming out of my blocks. I’m not really a fan of these blocks. These are the worst blocks I have ever experienced. I have to get the start together as I can’t keep doing this.”

Pressed on what exactly was wrong with them, he said: “It’s shaky. When I did my warm-up and pushed back, it fell back. It’s just not what I’m used to. It’s not as sturdy.”

Asked for a response to the criticism, a spokesman for the world governing body, the IAAF, said: “The starting blocks here in London are exactly the same model as were used at the last world championships in Beijing.

“The starting equipment including the blocks are checked after each session.”

Bolt will run in the third semi-final on Saturday night, with the final to be staged two and a half hours later.

He is seeking his fourth gold in the event, having won at every world championships since 2009 apart from 2011 in Daegu when he was disqualified for a false start.

Nagina Online,"The Internet has brought to this nondescript kasba the world, from movies to music hits, videos of workouts to pornography.

On July 12, 27-year-old Daulatram was beaten with a shoe 11 times at a mahapanchayat in Nagina village in Mewat district of Haryana. A Dalit schoolteacher, Daulatram was accused of sharing an offensive Facebook post against Muslims; a similar post had led to clashes in Basirhat in West Bengal, 1,481 km away, a few days earlier. He was also asked to leave the village for three months.

But what happened to Daulatram, the family says, was a culmination of tension brewing in the village for three months, over social media. “Three months ago, a Muslim boy from the village put up a post on Facebook against gau mata. My brother confronted them and a group of Muslim men asked him to back off. Since then, several offensive posts against Hindus have been put up,” says Suresh Kumar, 24, Daulatram’s brother, who works at a petrol pump. “Now another Muslim boy has put up a vulgar post against Hindus and we are seeking another mahapanchayat,” says Kumar.

Located in one of the poorest districts of Haryana, Muslim-dominated Nagina has a population of 1,36,009, of which 93,688 are ‘non-workers’, according to the 2011 Census. The literacy rate stands at 39 per cent (52.8 per cent among men; 25.06 per cent among women), way lower than the state average of 67.91 per cent. But each of the 19,909 households of Nagina has a phone, says sarpanch Naseem Khan. At least 60 per cent of these are smartphones. Six major network providers have their transmission towers near the village.

The Internet has brought to this nondescript kasba the world, from movies to music hits, videos of workouts to pornography. It has also brought to Nagina social media, now a common thread exposing and inflaming faultlines across the country — sometimes stopping at minor incidents such as Daulatram’s, often ending in violence and riots like Basirhat or Muzaffarnagar.

All it takes is a smartphone.

Mohammad Azhar, 21, BCom student

Facebook friends: 150; Profile photo: changed everyday WhatsApp messages: 70 a day

It’s a little after 10 am and Niyaz Khan’s small phone shop in the bustling Nagina village market is crammed with customers. Along with a dozen other men, Mohammad Azhar is leaning over Khan, his shirt soaked in sweat, urging him to ‘top up’ his Reliance Jio 4G data plan with Rs 96 — it will give him 1 GB data every day for a week. “We can now watch unlimited videos. Mai zyada foreign ke workout videos dekhta hoon (I mostly watch foreign workout videos),” says Azhar, a BCom student at Government College, Nagina.

Minutes later, the top-up is done, and Azhar wriggles out of the huddle of men to check the message box on his Intex Aqua 3G Star phone. “I got this phone last year for Rs 3,400. My father refused to give me the money, so I worked part-time at a dhaba and saved up. Then the Reliance Jio connection solved all my problems,” says the 21-year-old, whose father works as a labourer in Sohna, an hour away. That is also where he bought his phone from.

While he is still “learning” Facebook — “I have only 150 friends so far” — WhatsApp and ‘Google Search’ take up most of his day. “I get about 70-80 forwarded messages a day, funny images, news… Bahaut bakwas bhi aata hai (I get a lot of rubbish too). I have to respond to every message because the sender can see I have read it when the ticks go blue,” says Azhar, who is the third of six siblings (two younger sisters and four brothers).

His brothers work in a local hair salon and his sisters, both teenagers, stay at home. “They do household chores,” he says. Do they have phones? “Girls don’t get to use phones in our village,” Azhar scoffs.

Azhar also uses WhatsApp to make calls to “friends abroad”. “Two-three people from the village went to Kuwait for work a few years ago. The calls are for free,” he smiles. Surfing local news websites too interests him. “Everyone is forwarding news, I also try and read up on ‘Google News’… Otherwise I am mostly downloading or streaming movies,” he says. Hindi movies? “Sab type ki movies (All kinds of films),” he blushes.

About the “vivaadi (controversial)” photos that have led to tension in the village, he says, “I don’t know where the photos and videos come from.” However, Azhar is not surprised at the content. “Everyone has a photo editor on their phones and putting something on the image of a pig or cow is not very difficult.”

As the rush at Khan’s shop clears, Azhar plugs in his phone to one of the charging points there. “Though the village has electricity for some years now, it is not equally distributed,” says Khan, who sells SIM cards as well as provides pre-paid top-ups. His is one of three such shops in the village, all of which have come up in the past four years. “Getting a phone is not difficult anymore, people from the village go to markets in Sohna, Gurgaon and even Gaffar Market (West Delhi) and get them,” says Khan.

Abdul Sattar, a teacher at Azhar’s college, complains about students fleeing early to talk on their phones. “Sabhi phones se prabhavit hain (Everyone is influenced by phones). Boys of Haryana played cricket, participated in races… Now, the village too has become like city,” says Sattar. His phone charged, Azhar prepares to leave for college. “I am not allowed to carry it, but then no one really checks,” he says. Then turning around, he instructs, “Don’t print my photograph, I don’t like it.”

Azhar changes his Facebook profile picture every day though, for all his 150 Facebook friends. It is usually a selfie.

Naseem Khan, 26, sarpanch

WhatsApp groups: 20 Facebook friends: 4,300

Naseem Khan looks exhausted. He has just returned from a panchayat meeting where over 20 people gathered to sort out a “Facebook fight”. “There is a Palwal page on Facebook where a Hindu boy from the village had posted many offensive comments against Muslims. Three Muslim boys were angry. It took us nearly six hours to get the Hindu boy to apologise,” says Khan, the sarpanch of Nagina village, who has a bachelors degree in business administration.

“Now this is the kind of business I handle,” he smiles. “I became sarpanch in January 2016, and since then, I have been mostly resolving issues related to WhatsApp and Facebook. In cheezon se na Hindu na Musalman, poora Hindustan khatre mein hai (Social media is not a threat to just Hindus or Muslims, but the entire country),” he says.

Khan was one of the first people in Nagina to get a phone. “I got a Nokia 3250 handset 10-12 years ago. It cost me over Rs 10,000,” says Khan. “Everything has two aspects — positive and negative. But since Internet data became free, I see only the negative taking over in Nagina. There was never any Hindu-Muslim conflict, and now any trivial post can trigger a fight.”

He tries his best to be on “top of things”, Khan adds. He is part of at least 20 WhatsApp groups — Mewat ki Samasyain (problems), Sarpanch Ekta Zindabad (Hail Sarpanch Unity), Khidmat-e-Khalq (To help), Mewat News Part 1,2,3, Mewat ki Shaan (Pride of Mewat), among others. His over 4,300 friends on Facebook include many people from the village, and he also keeps a check on their timelines.

“But there is only so much one can do. There are a million fake IDs. A majority of people in the village are illiterate and don’t even understand what they are forwarding. Also, most of the youth are unemployed, that just gives them more time to create trouble online,” says Khan, who now owns a Rs 35,000 Samsung S7 phone.

“In the Daulatram case too, he simply forwarded the post and didn’t think of the repercussions. Then, the video of him being beaten up with a shoe went viral… Na sunnana, na samajhna, ab bas sabko sab cheezein viral karni hai (People don’t want to listen, or understand. They just want to make things viral),” he says. Mewat Superintendent of Police Nazneen Bhasin says they have been trying to contain the social media influence. “We are aware of the posts being put out, often giving rise to anger. We have been conducting community-dialogue programmes, with sarpanches, youth. Whenever an issue comes to light, we take strict action. Our focus is on promoting goodwill.”

It is Rajuddin, who calls himself a “social worker”, that the villagers of Nagina depend on for their daily news fix. The 36-year-old has also been held responsible for making Daulatram’s video “viral”. “I only do my job. Every morning I scan all local and national newspapers and websites and send out news updates to about 31 WhatsApp groups that have over 19,000 members from across Mewat,” he says.

Rajuddin’s WhatsApp groups range from “serious” ones such as Mewat News, Haryana Rajniti, and History of Mewat, to more lighter ones such as Salaam, for sharing jokes etc. “While we check most of the content, there are times when members post offensive messages. We remove such members,” he claims, adding that he also checks the Facebook profiles of people who want to become members of his groups.

Around noon every day, youngsters of the village gather in a room at Naseem Khan’s home, one of the few spacious residences in Nagina. “Wait till the teenagers come,” says a friend of Khan’s, who does not wish to be identified. “They only do three things on their phones — 70 per cent watch vulgar videos, the rest watch songs of Sapna Chaudhary (a Haryana stage dancer and singer), and if time is left, it is for YouTube videos,” he laughs. Adds Khan, “They may not know how to read and write, but they know the red button for YouTube. They have set it on the ‘Hindi’ mode.”

A kilometre away, at Government Senior Secondary Boys school, principal Saadiq Ahmed, 52, says he rounds up at least seven-eight boys every day for using phones at school. “We have also been telling students to be careful about what they do on the Internet. On several occasions a wrong post by a student has led to misunderstanding,” says Ahmed. “NGOs must hold camps to educate children about the Internet.”

Tushar Khan, 19, ITI student

Facebook photos: 100 WhatsApp groups: 12

When Tushar Khan wakes up every morning around 6, the first thing he does is check his phone, for the number of ‘likes’ his profile picture has got. “It is usually over 50,” beams the 19-year-old, who is enrolled in the Industrial Training Institute nearby. Next, he checks the four WhatsApp groups he is a member of: Khan Boys (for jokes and memes), Fashion (where all the 60 members upload selfies), and the rest the Class 10 pass says he “can’t tell you about”.

Tushar has decided to skip class today and spend time with friends Mohammad Saif (18) and Asif Hussain (22). As they stroll around, barely looking up from their phones, Tushar halts to show a picture. The group laughs. “We enjoy chatting on our phones, Facebook chatting, WhatsApp chatting. YouTube is good too, but I prefer Google videos. Anything you write throws up responses,” says Khan. Agrees Saif, “That is where most of our videos come from.”

A Google search for ‘WhatsApp videos’ throws up on an average seven crore responses, ranging from funny baby and animal videos to dance numbers and porn. “We have made many new friends on Facebook and most are from outside Mewat. There are some girls too,” Khan smiles. Jatin Chawla, a staff member at the Nagina ITI where Tushar and Saif study — it takes in students who have passed Class 10 onwards — says while phones are not allowed on campus, they hardly check. “Phones are a part of life now, even I am on WhatsApp and Facebook,” says Chawla. “Only about 3-4 per cent of the students create trouble, the rest use phones for information,” he adds.

A few metres away from the institute, Sameem Khan, 24, is handing out new connections at a Vodafone mini store. “Now just a copy of your Aadhaar card and fingerprints is enough to get a connection,” says Sameem, adding that he reaches his target of selling 700 SIM cards a month easily. “I get 50-60 visits a day from students of the ITI. Most buy more than one SIM card,” he says.

For Asif Hussain, a final-year BA student and a driver, the phone is all about “education”. “I am pursuing my graduation through distance learning and I barely get time to study because of my job. The Internet is where I get all my information from. I am a member of about 50 groups on WhatsApp and Facebook and they are all related to news and education. Whatever I don’t understand in my textbooks, I Google,” says Hussain. Tushar, Saif and Asif all have Vivo and Oppo phones, which cost them Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000.

An hour later, the group is joined by 37-year-old Mohammad Azad, who is unemployed and depends on agriculture to provide for his family — wife and four children, the eldest 13. Azad, who has never been to school, recently bought a OnePlus phone. “I bought it out of necessity,” he insists. “Every afternoon when I met my friends, they would either be busy on their phones or talk about some video.”

Unlike the younger boys, Azad isn’t interested in Facebook or WhatsApp but YouTube. “I love cars. I have been watching videos of Hyundai Creta. I learnt how to type the words from these younger boys. After that, you don’t have to do much. It all works on autoplay,” he says. Soon, the conversation drifts to a video doing the rounds. “There is a girl getting a haircut and then suddenly an insect eats up all her hair and she dies. People are saying it is from Mewat… I wonder who she is,” says Azad, as the group returns to their phones.

Rahul Kumar, 23, owns a computer shop

Facebook friends: 2,200 WhatsApp groups: 5

Rahul Kumar’s Facebook wall has been flooded with posts since morning, most of them related to the news report that students at Mewat Model Public School in Madhi had complained about three teachers “forcing them to perform namaz”. “Now the media is saying that teachers are trying to convert Hindu students… Some issue or the other keeps coming up on Facebook,” says the 23-year-old BCom graduate, who opened a computer shop five months ago in the Nagina village market. “Mostly I ignore such messages and posts, but at times, they make me angry,” he admits.

Kumar says that after completing his graduation from Government College, Nagina, he tried without success for a job. Then he borrowed money from friends to open the shop. Kumar’s father owns a vegetable shop in the market and he is the eldest of four siblings. His brother works as a driver while his two sisters “stay at home”. While setting up the shop, Kumar also saved up to buy an ‘Asus Zenfone 2’ phone for Rs 14,000. “It was a necessity for the job. Usse pehle Samsung ka saada phone tha (Before that I had a simple Samsung phone),” says Kumar, who makes Rs 20,000 a month.

Today the phone is his life, Kumar admits. “From news to social issues to connecting with other computer shops, I do it all on my phone,” he says. Plus there are his WhatsApp groups. “I am a member of five groups — Informer, Dharmik Karya (religious activity), Mewat Computer Centres, Hindu Samaaj Samasya etc. We share news of villages in Mewat… Since the Hindus are a minority in our village, we discuss our issues separately in the Hindu Samaaj group,” says Kumar.

He is aware of the tensions triggered by social media in the village in the past three months. “WhatsApp is mostly about discussion, but posts on Facebook are provocative,” he says. “Kai baar to main bhi bhavnaon mein beh jaata hoon (At times even I get carried away)… Like this teachers trying to convert students story… Everyone has an opinion and no one knows where these posts come from. Everyone thinks that if it is on Facebook and WhatsApp, it must be true,” says Kumar. Half of his 2,200 friends on Facebook are strangers.

Kumar’s computer centre, where villagers come to type letters in Hindi and take print-outs, also has a “spare computer for youngsters”. “I get about 10 boys every day who come for chatting,” he smiles. “A few girls come too, but they are mostly accompanied by their parents or siblings.” He adds, “Unlike Muslim families, we let our girls use phones.” On a condition. His sisters use his phone when he is at home. “They don’t have their own handsets.”

Mohammad Zubair, 23, driver

Facebook friends: 400 WhatsApp groups: 7

Surrounded by his goats and clucking chickens, Mohammad Zubair, 23, sits on a cot, checking Facbook updates on his Vivo touch phone. A driver, Zubair bought the phone for Rs 7,000 a month ago. He has two SIM cards, Idea and Jio. As his father Jaan Mohammad walks in, Zubair switches from Facebook to YouTube. The song Aisa koi zindagi mein aaye rings out in the open yard. “From Palwal to Nagina, all children are just glued to their phones),” the 58-year-old Mohammad admonishes.

Listening with half an ear to his father, Zubair slips his phone into his pocket. The arrival of Zubair’s “touch phone” hasn’t gone down too well with the family. “All the fights in the village are happening because of these phones,” says Mohammad, who has six children. His elder brother Ishaaq Khan, who has 25 children from three wives, joins in, “In panchayat meetings we issue specific instructions to the youth to stay away from phones, but no one is listening. We get so many complaints from teachers.”

But Zubair is unfazed. “I make many new friends when I go on driving assignments. I keep in touch with them on my phone. Whatever these elders are talking about, I do none of it. I like listening to songs and watching films, but that is only because there is nothing else to do here in the village. The nearest cinema hall is 5 km away,” says Zubair, who studied till Class 8. Patting one of the goats, he points to the mobile towers visible from the roof of his house and says, “There is the Idea tower, there is Vodafone and there is Jio. Airtel, Tata and BSNL towers are also nearby… What is wrong in using your phone? It connects you to the world.” But doesn’t that hold true for his 14-year-old sister Hasrat as well? “No, that would be wrong,” he says.

Hasrat, 14, Class 8 student

Facebook friends: 0 WhatsApp groups: 0; No phone

Do you want to use a phone? “Hamare yahan ki ladkiyan phone nahin use karti (Girls of our village don’t use phones),” says Zubair, answering for his sister. Do you want to see the videos your brother watches? “If girls in the village are seen with a phone, people will gossip, we can’t risk that,” interrupts her father Jaan Mohammad.

Do you want a phone one day? No one says anything. Hasrat, dressed in a white salwar-kameez, her school uniform, runs out of the yard.

Iran’s Hassan Rouhani starts new term facing reform criticism,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani waits to welcome European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini at the presidential office in Tehran, Iran, Saturday, August 5, 2017. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi) Iranian President Hassan Rouhani waits to welcome European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini at the presidential office in Tehran, Iran, Saturday, August 5, 2017. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was set to be inaugurated in front of foreign guests on Saturday, but already faces criticism for reportedly bowing to conservatives in forming a new government. Rouhani, a 68-year-old cleric considered a political moderate, began his second term on Thursday when he was sworn in by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

But today’s ceremony in parliament is the glitzier affair, with guests including EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who has vowed to continue building ties with Iran despite mounting pressure from the United States to keep the Islamic republic isolated. Some of Iran’s older friends also arrived in Tehran, including Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.

The emir of Qatar, which has fallen out with its Gulf allies in part over ties to Iran, was notably absent despite attending Rouhani’s last inauguration in 2013.

But among Iranians, the real attention was on who would be named to Rouhani’s new cabinet. He has already been barraged with criticism over indications that women would again be entirely absent and that his reformist allies would barely be represented.

His last government had three women among a large cohort of vice-presidents, but they lacked ministerial roles that would require approval by parliament.

“It was the reformists that allowed him to win the elections in 2013 and 2017… he must listen to those who supported him,” Rassoul Montajabnia, of the reformist National Confidence party, told the Arman newspaper.

Rouhani won a convincing victory over hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi in the May presidential election, vowing to continue rebuilding ties with the West and easing social restrictions at home.

That helped win over the reformists — whose candidates dropped out of the last two elections to ensure his victory.

“Rouhani created a lot of expectation and now there is a sense that he is retreating from his promises,” Ali Shakourirad, head of the reformist People’s Unity Party. The absence of women was down to pressure from religious conservatives behind the scenes, Shakourirad added.

“Rouhani didn’t want to make his task any more complicated than it already is,” he told AFP. The final line-up is due to be announced in the coming days, and must then be approved by parliament.

Despite the furore, the reshuffle is not expected to touch big names such as Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Oil Minister Bijan Namadar Zanganeh.

“The main ministers are very likely to stay in place,” said Henry Smith, Iran analyst with consultancy Control Risks.

“Rouhani will have a fairly smooth time getting parliament to approve his appointees. He’s been doing back and forth consultations with the necessary power centres — the parliament speaker, supreme leader, the Revolutionary Guards — and I don’t think you’ll see a significant change in economic or indeed social policy,” he added.

Despite his efforts to build backroom consensus, hardliners have given Rouhani a rough ride since his election, perhaps worried at the growing strength of the reformists. The arrest of his brother on corruption charges was interpreted by some as a shot across the bow by the hardline judiciary.

Rouhani also triggered a war of words with the Revolutionary Guards after criticising their outsized role in the economy, although analysts say this is part of a cautious realignment of Iran’s policies to balance its security priorities with the need to attract investment.

“Rouhani has no interest in pushing the Revolutionary Guards totally out of the economy. It’s about creating enough space so Iran can get the foreign investment and technology it needs,” said Smith.

Investment has belatedly started to arrive in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal that eased sanctions, notably through last month’s billion-dollar gas deal with France’s Total and China’s CNPC.

Billions more are needed to jumpstart the stagnant economy and tackle a jobless rate of 12.7 per cent.

But with Washington imposing yet more sanctions this week, Iran’s re-engagement with the world remains largely stalled.

“The problem is Iran feels the need to react to these moves by the US, which just gives the US fuel,” said Smith.

“What cooler heads would suggest is not to respond in kind and try to present themselves as the more rational party, but politically that is very difficult to do.”

Patrick Patterson: Journey in finding one of West Indies’ most lethal bowlers,"Updated: July 23, 2017 1:20 pm

The most fearsome of Caribbean pacers disappeared into oblivion in the 1990s. Patrick Patterson is still around, though he does not quite remember the man he was, or his bowling spells which went down in history. But he is grateful for the dogged fan who travelled half-way around the world to his door — to hear his story.

There had been murmurs around about Patterson’s present state — that he’s lost in the bush or is in an asylum; maybe, even roaming the streets as a destitute."
Syria army takes last IS-held town in Homs: monitor,"Already defeated in its Iraqi bastion of Mosul, IS is facing multiple assaults in Syria. Already defeated in its Iraqi bastion of Mosul, IS is facing multiple assaults in Syria.

Syria’s army seized the last Islamic State group stronghold in the country’s Homs province, clearing their path to attack the jihadists in the country’s east, a monitor said. Al-Sukhna, some 70 kilometres northeast of the famed ancient city of Palmyra, is the last town on the road to the eastern city of Deir Ezzor, where a government garrison has held out under IS siege since early 2015.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, said government forces had captured the town after heavy army artillery fire and air strikes by government ally Russia. There was no official confirmation of the capture from Syria’s government. State news agency SANA said the army had surrounded the town from three sides.

Since May, Syria’s army has been conducting a broad military campaign with Russian support to recapture the vast desert that separates the capital Damascus from Deir Ezzor and other towns along the Euphrates Valley. Already defeated in its Iraqi bastion of Mosul, IS is facing multiple assaults in Syria. The US-backed Syrian Defence Forces now control more than half of its most important remaining stronghold Raqa.

Mumbai: Three teenagers drown in sea near Shivaji Park,"Three teenaged boys drowned at sea near the rocky seashore at Shivaji Park. (Representational Image) Three teenaged boys drowned at sea near the rocky seashore at Shivaji Park. (Representational Image)

Three teenaged boys drowned at sea near the rocky seashore at Shivaji Park on Saturday morning. Though the incident was reported to the fire brigade at 11.37 am and the officials reached the site within minutes, witnesses reported that they were seen drowning around half-an-hour before help arrived and none of them could be rescued alive.

Fire officials said 13-year-old Bharat Hanumanta, 16-year-old Anup Yadav and 15-year-old Rohit Yadav were all students of the Unal Mill High School in Mahim. “While Hanumanta was taken to Bhabha Hospital, the other two were sent to KEM Hospital. They were all declared dead upon arrival,” said the official.

The police said three separate cases of accidental death have been registered at Mahim police station.

Police sources added that the boys were all residents of Dharavi. “They were playing kabaddi on the beach. After finishing, one of the boys went into the water to wash up when the water sucked him in. The other two boys dived in to help him but all three drowned,” said Rajiv Jain, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone V.

Dialogue only way to cut religious stereotypes: PM Narendra Modi,"PM Narendra Modi after voting in the Vice-Presidential election at Parliament on Saturday.

PRIME MINISTER Narendra Modi on Saturday said that dialogue is the only way to cut through deep-rooted religious stereotypes and prejudices that divide communities across the world and sow seeds of conflict between nations and societies. “As the interconnected and interdependent world of 21st century battles a number of global challenges, from terrorism to climate change, I am confident that the solutions will be found through Asia’s oldest traditions of dialogue and debate,” he said in a video message to the second edition of “Samvad-Global Initiative on Conflict Avoidance and Environment Consciousness”, being held in Yangon.

Modi said he is a “product of the ancient Indian tradition that firmly believes in dialogue on difficult issues.” He also said that the ancient Indian concept of “tarka shastra” (debating) is founded on dialogue and debate as the model for exchange of views and avoidance of conflict.

It is only natural that the search for answers be led by the humanity’s longest traditions of thought, rooted in various religions, civilizations, and multiple streams of spirituality, he said. Giving examples of Ram, Krishna, Buddha and Bhakta Prahlad, the Prime Minister said the purpose of each of their actions was to uphold dharma (duty), which has sustained Indians from ancient to modern times.

Talking about the environment, he said man must relate to nature and revere it, and not merely consider it a resource to be exploited. If man does not nurture nature, then nature reacts in the form of climate change, he said. Environmental laws and regulations, while essential in any modern society, afford only an inferior protection to nature, he added, calling for “harmonious environmental consciousness.”

How to love a language: Urdu poet Gulzar Dehlvi spills his literary secrets,"(Source: Gajendra Yadav) (Source: Gajendra Yadav)

Pandit Anand Mohan Zutshi Gulzar Dehlvi walks into the living room of his home in Noida, wearing a white sherwani-churidar, Nehru topi and a pearl chain with two lockets — one of Krishna and one with aayats of the Quran on it. He is frail, he is over 90. But once he starts talking, the practised performer, who has mesmerised millions at mushairas and nashists (literary meets) for seven decades, takes over. The voice is strong and his memory, razor sharp.

Veteran Urdu poet Gulzar Dehlvi, was the editor of Science ki Duniya, the only science magazine the Government of India published in Urdu. The walls of his home are covered with photos of him onstage with big names from the world of literature and politics, in different periods and different countries. Dehlvi is a Kashmiri Pandit who spent his life working for Urdu and enriching it with his poetry. He’s a symbol of all that Delhi has stood for, and is in danger of losing — a multicultural identity, where languages and traditions of all the empires that ruled the city evolved from and merged into each other organically.

Dehlvi’s association with the freedom movement began early — when he was in Class IV, he says. In 1933, King George V and Queen Mary of England were celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary. In Delhi, engraved brass plates were being distributed, along with four annas to schoolkids to have chaat and pakaudas at Chandni Chowk. “I rounded up students of various government-run schools, and we boycotted the celebration. That is how Aruna Asaf Ali noticed me, and my association with the Congress began,” he says. “Most of the nationalist poetry during the freedom movement, such as those by Bhagat Singh, was written in Urdu, a language some today seek to discredit as un-Indian,” he says.

During the freedom movement and after independence, Dehlvi was a regular at Congress meetings and rallies, as a premier Inquilabi poet. In 1951, prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru sent him to USSR for an international conference, and he was selected as the second world youth laureate.

Dehlvi was born on July 7, 1926 in Old Delhi’s Gali Kashmeerian to Allama Tirbhoon Nath Zutshi “Zar” Dehlavi and Brij Rani Zutshi “Bezar” Dehlavi, both Urdu poets. Sitaram market in Old Delhi is named after one of his ancestors, he says. Apart from passing his MA exam from Hindu College, he also cleared the Adeeb Fazil and Munshi Fazil examinations (equivalent to high school and BA degree respectively across all Urdu boards) of Anjuman Taraqqi Urdu Hind in New Delhi.

Partition dealt a crippling blow to Urdu in India. Dehlvi says, “The Partition strengthened those who sought to establish the binary of Hindi-Hindu-Hindustan and Urdu-Muslim-Pakistan. After independence, there was a time when the biggest Urdu scholars in India were afraid to speak up for the language. Before 1947, I fought against the British. After that, I’ve been fighting for communal harmony and for Urdu conservation.”

To this end, he was instrumental in setting up Urdu schools across the country since 1970, and abroad, in later decades. Dehlvi also fought to publish the government’s science magazine in Urdu. “After independence, both Nehru and Maulana Azad (then education minister) would speak of inculcating scientific temper in their public speeches. I asked, ‘Maulana, how will this temper be developed if people don’t get scientific literature in their own language?’”

Permissions from Nehru and Azad came in 1957-58. “But many in the bureaucracy were anti-Urdu, and the magazine didn’t see the light of day for a decade. After Indira Gandhi became the prime minister, I badgered her, and, after helping resolve a workers’ strike at several CSIR labs, secured the organisation’s backing. The first bulletin of Science Ki Duniya came out in 1970, the full-fledged magazine was published in 1976.”

After 1990, Dehlvi says, “communal forces” gained political power like never before. “The Congress started weakening. Many strong leaders broke away to form their own parties. But the worst blow came from within — Narsimha Rao presided over the Babri Masjid demolition. This is when I began to withdraw from political life. Do you know, I was the one who introduced Rao to Indira? But after Babri, I met him at a party at the home of Syed Sibtey Razi (former MP, governor of Assam, Jharkhand). In front of 50 people, I told him, ‘From today I am dead to you and you to me’”.

Since 1990, Dehlvi says, Muslims are being pushed deeper into ghettos, “It suits the agenda of certain parties to portray Muslims as backward, opposed to change — a systematic campaign to alienate the community. Every day, there are reports of attacks on their diet, their livelihoods,” he says.

Does this mean that Urdu too faces a grimmer future? Dehlvi is optimistic: “In the past few years, many private organisations are running Urdu classes and holding literary meets. My fight for the language goes on, but there are more fighting alongside me.”

His other mission is to fight communalism. Is he equally optimistic there? Says Dehlvi, “I have seen and known Delhi under various rulers. My ancestors were called here from Kashmir by Shah Jahan. Today, a small gang of men are trying to define what the country is. India is like an elephant, too vast for those with a narrow vision to comprehend. People get hold of a leg, or the tail, and feel they have the whole of India in their hands. But, for all their efforts to demonise Mulsims, the BJP and RSS haven’t even been able to secure the support of all Hindus, let alone Sikhs or Jains.”

But, he’s quite particular about keeping his distance from the present government. “Invitations still come for government events, but I don’t wish to participate in any function hosted by a communal government,” says Dehlvi.

But, he’s open to discussions on India’s past with them. “I can’t work with them. I will be glad if, instead of harassing Muslims on the street, they come to me. I will give them history lessons — how the Vedas talk of rishis eating meat, how the first freedom fighters, long before the Congress was born, were Muslims.”

Unchecked communalism can leave lasting scars on India, he warns. “I am a post-holder in the oldest Ramlila committee of Delhi, and of the Hazrat Nizamuddin dargah. I observe Holi, Diwali, Janmashtami, Shivratri, and all three Eids. This is what India is, and this is the only way it can survive. Giving in to communal rhetoric will end up fragmenting India, just as the British had once fragmented it.”

"Cutting Dead Trees: Is permission needed even during emergencies, High Court asks administration","Dead trees at the divider of Sector 28 and Industrial Area Phase 1 in Chandigarh on Wednesday. Sahil Walia Dead trees at the divider of Sector 28 and Industrial Area Phase 1 in Chandigarh on Wednesday. Sahil Walia

FINDING IT strange that one needs permission from the adviser to the UT administrator even to remove dead trees, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday sought a response from the Chandigarh Administration as to whether authorities would have to do the same even in case of emergencies like natural calamities.

During the resumed hearing of the case of a 20-year-old Chandigarh woman, whose right leg below the knee had to be amputated after she came under a heavy branch of a dead tree at Sector 17 in September 2013, Justice Rajan Gupta observed that power has to be delegated for an easy process in the matter and there is even confusion related to the jurisdiction of trees among the UT departments and the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation.

The HC Bench made the observation after the counsel, representing Chandigarh MC, said till recently the corporation did not even have the power to prune trees. MC Chief Engineer, in a written affidavit, told the High Court that in the victim’s case, a complaint was made only in January 2013 but since the cases for the adviser’s approval of the trees are grouped in one lot and after that the bids are invited for the removal and disposal of trees, the case had been pending for long.

“It is submitted that the office is required to follow procedure laid down for the removal of trees as well as the departmental procedure and opening of tenders as such there is no laxity on the part of any official of the Municipal Corporation, Chandigarh,” said the chief engineer.

Chandigarh MC has informed the High Court that while conduting the census this year, of the 1,65,597 trees in the city, a total of 1,029 were found to be dead and dry. The municipal corporation has so far only received permission from the adviser to remove 602 trees and for the remaining 427 dead and dry trees, the approval was awaited according to the official response.

“Out of the 602 trees, the approval of approximately 115 trees was granted by the competent authority in May and June this year and these trees have already been removed. The remaining 487 dead and dry trees for which approval was received this July shall be cut by 31.08.2017,” said the chief engineer.

The High Court, during the earlier orders, had observed that it needs to be examined “whether the lengthy procedure as envisaged by the UT Administration is necessary to be followed even if the life of an inhabitant of the city is endangered due to any such circumstances as obtained in the instant case” and had asked the MC chief engineer to appear in court in person.

The single bench on Wednesday said it would require an amicus for assistance in the case. The UT counsel were asked to seek instructions regarding permission to remove dead trees and file the same during the next hearing on September 6.

Burnley friendly against Hannover abandoned after crowd trouble,"British police confront Hannover soccer club fans. (Source: AP) British police confront Hannover soccer club fans. (Source: AP)

Premier League Burnley’s pre-season friendly match with Bundesliga club Hannover was abandoned at half-time following crowd trouble from the visiting German supporters.

Burnley said in a statement on Twitter that the game had been abandoned “on police advice” and home supporters were asked to leave the stadium.

Media reports said the visiting supporters had thrown seats and surged towards Burnley fans during the first half shortly after Burnley had taken the lead in the 41st minute.

Chief Superintendent Chris Bithell, of Lancashire Police, said in a statement posted on the force’s Facebook page that Hannover fans had also tried to attack police and stewards.

“A decision has been taken to abandon the football match between Burnley FC and Hanover 96, following consultation between the police match commander, the referee and Burnley FC’s grounds safety officer.

“This follows violent behaviour by a group of travelling Hanover fans, who attempted to attack fans in the home stands, as well as police officers and stewards,” he said.

The incidents took place in the Cricket Field stand which is divided between visiting and home supporters.

“Although a robust policing operation was in place for the match, based on pre-game intelligence, additional resources have now been brought in from across the county to ensure no further disorder occurs,” said Bithell.

Burnley manager Sean Dyche said he backed the police’s decision to cut short the match.

“They called us in and said ‘Look, we’re going to call it for the safety of all involved, stewards, fans, police etc’.

“That was pretty early. The police were in the referee’s room, called me, went through the procedure, and obviously we fully support the police’s decision. Hopefully nobody has got hurt,” he said.

Burnley said they would be making a statement later on Saturday.

"Arsenal will prioritise Premier League, says Arsene Wenger","Arsenal failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 2004. (Source: Reuters) Arsenal failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 2004. (Source: Reuters)

Arsenal’s failure to qualify for the Champions League will allow them to focus their attention this season on winning the Premier League for the first time since 2004, manager Arsene Wenger has said.

The Frenchman noted in May that the two most recent league champions – Chelsea and Leicester City – did not play European football during their title-winning campaigns.

“For us it is a good opportunity to focus completely on the Premier League,” Wenger told British media.

“I would say that the Premier League has, in my opinion, taken over from the Champions League interest-wise.”

Arsenal’s fifth-placed finish last season meant they missed out on the Champions League for the first time in 20 years and they will play in the less prestigious Europa League instead.

“I will always play a team that has a good chance to win the next game,” Wenger added.

“In the Europa League, if we can afford sometimes to rest some players we will do it. But we have to adapt to the level of the competition and see first what kind of group we play in.”

Arsenal beat league champions Chelsea in May’s FA Cup final and so on Sunday the London rivals will face each other again in the traditional season-opener, the Community Shield.

Wenger expects Antonio Conte’s side to have a tougher time retaining the league title than they did winning it last season without the distraction of Champions League football.

“Last year, Chelsea did not play in the European Cup and, certainly, they were a bit more consistent in the Premier League,” Wenger added.

“Will they make as many points? I don’t know. But they will fight certainly for the championship again.

“And in the FA Cup final we have shown that the gap was not as high maybe. And we have to show that again on Sunday.”

I need to be cautious and have more smarts in the future: Chris Lynn,"Chris Lynn went under the knife last month. Chris Lynn went under the knife last month.

Australian power hitter Chris Lynn has claimed that his shoulder injury won’t change the way he bats, but diving around in the field is something that he has to be careful about. It maybe recalled here that Lynn had gone under the knife last month after his third serious shoulder injury in the past two years.

Speaking to the News Corp, Lynn said,”Longevity was why I took that option to have the operation. It’s a short-term loss for a long-term gain.

“They (career ending) are words you don’t want to hear but they are down that path. “I’ve got to be more cautious and have more smarts about how I go about things.

“I am zero or 100 but there are times I have to reel it back and get another 10 years out of my career. We’ll see how smart I am in the next 12 months.”

Meanwhile, Lynn hasn’t given up hope of playing in this summer’s extended BBL season.

“I’d love to get back (for the BBL) and walk out in front of the Gabba again. It’s something I get really excited and nervous about as well,” Lynn said. “My fingers are crossed for the Big Bash.”

Stating that the surgery will ensure that he has to be careful while diving in the field, Lynn added, “It has been frustrating but it was the right decision to get it done. I want to play through tournaments and hopefully, make a mark and be fully fit for 12 months.

“I want to put the shoulder injury to bed. I want to go back to enjoying my cricket and being pain-free. I have to change my dynamic slightly but I won’t be changing the way I bat. I need to be more cautious in the field. Running around on the boundary is not an option. I might have to stop a few with the boot.”

Madison Keys downs Garbine Muguruza to reach Stanford Classic final,"Madison Keys will face countrywoman CoCo Vandeweghe in final. (Source: AP) Madison Keys will face countrywoman CoCo Vandeweghe in final. (Source: AP)

Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza was knocked out of the Stanford Classic on Saturday, losing her semi-final 6-3 6-2 to Madison Keys. American Keys, who missed the opening two months of the season after undergoing left wrist surgery, was relentless against the top seed. The players traded breaks to start the match before Keys took control late in the opening set by winning 12 of the last 14 points.

Muguruza never recovered from losing the opening set and Keys wrapped up the victory in less than an hour. Keys will face compatriot CoCo Vandeweghe in the final after she beat 18-year-old Catherine Bellis 6-3 6-1.

The sixth-seeded Vandeweghe returns to the final in Stanford after losing to Serena Williams in the title match in 2012.

“I’m five years older, and hopefully I’m more mature,” Vandeweghe told reporters. “I think (I’m) a little bit of a different tennis player. You grow and evolve as a tennis player and as a person, and I think especially in the last two years, it’s been kind of clicking in that regard.”

Vandeweghe recorded seven aces and 30 winners in the win over Bellis.

Press doesn’t have exclusive right to criticise anyone: Delhi court,"Press does not have any exclusive right or special privilege to comment, criticise or make imputations or allegations which are sufficient to ruin a citizen’s reputation, a Delhi court has said. Further, journalists do not have greater freedom than others, it has said while reminding that the responsibility of the scribes was higher as they have power to disseminate information. The court’s order came as it restrained the managing editor of a magazine from publishing any libellous articles against a man who has alleged that he was defamed.

It also directed the magazine editor and another person to pay Rs 30,000 and Rs 20,000 respectively to the man as “symbolic damages”.

“Further, journalists are in no better position than any other person. The press does not enjoy any exclusive rights under our Constitution, apart from those enjoyed by a citizen as a concomitant of the freedom of speech and rights against unlawful deprivation of life and liberty guaranteed under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution,” Additional District Judge Raj Kapoor said.

The court said the press enjoys no special privileges to comment, criticise or even to investigate the facts of any case and rights of press persons are not higher than that of the common man.

“In fact the responsibilities of a journalist are higher. The common man has limited means and reach in which he acts.

“A journalist on the other hand has a wider reach and power to disseminate information and therefore such power has the potential to cause irreparable damage to a matter under enquiry in a court of law or in a given case has greater propensity to scandalise … the dignity, majesty or reputation of an individual or an institution,” it said.

The man, a share broker and member of a housing society, had alleged that an article was published in the magazine in December 2007 to tarnish his image by using defamatory words.

He said when he issued a legal notice to the defendants, instead of apologising, they again defamed him by writing defamatory words against him to government agencies.

However, the founder and managing editor of the magazine claimed before the court that there was no defamatory article naming the man and that the magazine was not distributed among the business or connected circle of the man.

The second defendant, the then president and a resident of the same housing society, alleged that the man was indulging in unlawful activities in the society and he had filed a civil suit for removal of unauthorized encroachment there.

The court, however, said the two defendants had connived and published the articles in the magazine which were defamatory in nature and harmed the reputation of the man.

In case, you are not familiar with the jargon, a hen party is a bachelorette party with a farm-themed name.

There is no place for insecurity and spying in a relationship. But often people forget this and try to intervene in their partner’s life secretly. Haven’t we all heard stories about boyfriends or husbands checking their partner’s phone messages or emails? Or girlfriends and wives picking up a fight only based on assumptions? Yes, but what this guy did no one should be proud of. But thankfully, he was given a fitting reply and put to a task he deserved.

A night club in Newcastle called Filthy’s lambasted a boyfriend, who tried to bribe the staff at the bar to spy on his girlfriend, while she was there partying with her friends. The club shared a screenshot of his private message to them and posted it on their Facebook page and gave an apt reply.

“Hi my girlfriend is headed in with a Hens party this weekend,” he wrote. “I was wondering if I would be able to pay a staff member to keep an eye on her and make sure there’s no men at their table, etc. I don’t want the staff member to let the group know they’re watching though!”

Happy Friendship Day: 5 iconic friendships in Indian mythology,"The friendship between Krishna and Sudama is often cited as an example of the ideal friendship. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) The friendship between Krishna and Sudama is often cited as an example of the ideal friendship. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)

Colourful trinkets and friendship bands commercialised via pop culture. Music and dance celebrating the necessity of friendship. Cafés raising a toast to the divine bond of friendship, observed globally on first Sunday of August every year. Amidst this a rarity exists. Not many may be privy to the fact that ‘Winnie the Pooh’ was anointed and honoured as the global mascot of friendship by the United Nations. In 1998, the UN General Assembly honoured Pooh Bear and family with a commemorative inscription thanking him for his consistent message of companionship, loyalty and friendship to the world.

A walk down the memory lane

It is believed that the initial concept of friendship day came into existence with Joyce Hall, the founder of Hallmark greeting cards, advocating the idea in 1919. At the time, this was perceived as an exercise meant for commercial gains and expansionary business propaganda of the gifting industry.

Historically speaking, it is believed that hostilities after World War I in 1935, led the United States Congress into starting the tradition. The idea was to promote principles of peace, trust, cooperation and ameliorate hatred and mistrust among people and nations. Probably in sync with the ‘Wilson Fourteen Point’ agenda, a statement of ‘peace principles’ advocated by President Woodrow Wilson in 1918 to the US Congress.

Carrying that baton of peace and faith further, the ‘World Friendship Crusade’ was founded in 1958 so as to promote harmony as ‘a culture of peace’, commemorating July 30 as friendship day.

Diplomacy and Friendship

Further, United Nations proclaimed July 30 as the ‘International Day of Friendship’ in 2011. According to the Friendship Day declaration, the UN member States and the civil society were invited to observe this day and encourage participation of people to promote global diversity. This was an attempt to promote camaraderie and peace between people and nations weaving together traditions, ethnicities and different cultures, much in line with international cooperation efforts.

For instance, in the Indian context, consider the 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Friendship that is revered for its bilateral engagements. The recent visit to Israel by honourable PM demonstrated newer ties and bonhomie between him and his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, the PM of Israel. The golden principles of peace, coexistence and mutual respect of the ‘Panchsheel doctrine’ have time and again reverberated in context of diplomatic relations between India and its neighbours.

In fact, the peaceful philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ (meaning world is one family) from the Maha Upanishad is the real spirit of Indian global affairs moving away from binaries, to an all inclusive concept of comity and amity.

Fables from folklore

In this light, it is but axiomatic to unearth numerous virtues of friendship from the treasure trove of Indian legends. Here’s looking at few anecdotes that are cherished as timeless examples of amity from Indian mythology.

1. Krishna-Sudama

An eternal bond of friendship exhibiting a flourishing tie, knowing no boundaries of caste, creed or social status is that of Krishna and Sudama. It is said that both were best of friends, despite a huge socio-economic chasm that divided society at the time. It is believed that once Sudama fighting grave poverty, upon insistence of his wife so to combat penury, travelled all the way to Dwarka carrying a humble present for Lord Krishna. This gesture was more of a memento to honour the immortal bond that the two shared. Sudama’s wife packed a small amount of rice for his beloved friend in spite of not having enough food to feed her own children. Lord Krishna was delighted to meet his childhood friend. He savoured the rice serving, while calling it the sweetest meal he ever had.

2. Karna-Duryodhan

Legends have it that even though Duryodhan wanted to befriend Karna for his own pursuits, the union between them transpired to become one of the best remembered depictions of amity. At the time, Hastinapur was marred with realities of caste and discrimination, Duryodhan challenged conventions and norms by appointing Karna as the King of Anga amidst a battle between Arjuna and Karna. Karna while skilful, lacked an appropriate lineage that rendered his candidature futile in the eyes of Kripa, who mocked Karna on knowing his caste. Realising this, Duryodhana appointed him as the King of Anga, so he was regarded as Arjuna’s equal in that battle of power.

3. Krishna-Arjun

Touted primarily as a ‘teacher-disciple’ relationship, their bond is famous for its friend-philosopher-guide principle and eternal devotion that Arjuna exhibited towards their divine association. Legends are replete with their tales. The verse between them at the battle field forms the powerful narrative of Srimad Bhagvad Gita. Their relationship also teaches us that mentorship and friendship go hand in hand.

4. Trijata-Sita

In the Ramayana, even though Trijata is planted as Ravana’s agent, Trijata pines for Lord Ram’s victory. She helps Sita in all her adversities and provides her comfort by keeping her informed of the news from outside world. According to folklore, after Ravana’s death, Trijata is rewarded by Sita and Rama for having been her true companion. Revering her as local goddess, Trijata is worshipped in Ujjain and Varanasi.

5. Draupadi-Krishna

Legendary tales reveal that Draupadi and Krishna’s friendship had the eternal bond of ‘sakha’ and ‘sakhi’ at its essence. Many legends see the origins of Rakshabandhan in this tale of friendship and respect. According to beliefs, Krishna hurt his finger, when he threw the Sudarshan Chakra at Shishupal. Looking at this, Draupadi took a piece from her sari and tied it around Krishna’s finger to prevent it from bleeding. Touched by such gesture, Krishna took the vow of protecting Draupadi for all times to come.

Similar such tales and stories exist all across the world that have origins in mythical legends and popular culture. Greek story of Damon and Phythias; numerous tales from Panchtantra; TV shows such as Malgudi Days (especially the episode Swami and his friends); tales of Akbar and Birbal are stellar examples that urge us to keep the eternal bond between people alive. Especially in this age of hyper-individualism and technological seclusion.

"Five on-screen relationships that prove that not just love, even friendships are made in heaven","Happy Friendship Day: Ae Dil Hai Mushkil to Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, five Bollywood relationships that prove even friendships are made in heaven. Happy Friendship Day: Ae Dil Hai Mushkil to Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, five Bollywood relationships that prove even friendships are made in heaven.

What do you think Ae Dil Hai Mushkil was about? Ranbir trying to woo Anushka? No. It was about Anushka trying to explain how they could be nothing more than friends. If Karan can accept and move on, so can we, right? Well, this friendship day, we celebrate this very acceptance in Bollywood by bringing you five on-screen couples who have time and again proved that they are better off as friends.

Cocktail

This Homi Adjania rom-com was a superhit and was loved by audiences because we may be used to seeing a love triangle in movies, but what we are not used to seeing is, characters backing off from relationships for the sake of their friends. Meera (Diana Penty), Gautam (Saif Ali Khan) and Veronica (Deepika Padukone) were friends before they were anything else, and all three of them were ready to sacrifice their loved ones for each other’s happiness.

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil

Well, seems like this Karan Johar film was all about redefining love and friendships in Bollywood films. All Alizeh (Anushka Sharma) wanted Ayan (Ranbir Kapoor) to understand was that she sees him only as a friend. Ayan, eventually, makes peace with this fact that he and Alizeh can at best be friends and nothing more.

Kuch Kuch Hota Hai

While Anjali and Rahul may be the highlight of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, surprisingly even in 1998, this Karan Johar film stood up for friendship. And here’s how. Not because Rahul and Anjali were best friends who later found love but the credit goes to another special person. Many of us may not remember Salman Khan as Aman but he definitely understood what Anjali aka Kajol’s heart wanted and let her go, to stay just friends.

Dostana

Dostana proved how in the end, friendship trumps all. Sam (Abhishek Bachchan) and Kunal (John Abraham) may be pretending to be friends in the beginning and leching on Neha aka Priyanka Chopra but that only leads to distrust between them. Months after their feud, when Kunal and Sam meet in court, they recognise the value of their friendship with Neha and each other, and they reconcile.

Wake Up Sid

Wake Up Sid is considered to be one of Ranbir Kapoor’s finest performances till date. Playing a confused guy in the movie, Ranbir aka Sid’s friendship with Ayesha (Konkona Sen Sharma) helps him find himself. Audiences may have expected them to fall in love, but that was not everything. It gave us a refreshing take on relationships.

August 15 Independence Day speech: PM Narendra Modi invites suggestions from public,"PM Modi said that the suggestions can be sent through his website MyGov.in or through the Narendra Modi mobile application, where he personally reads them. (File photo) PM Modi said that the suggestions can be sent through his website MyGov.in or through the Narendra Modi mobile application, where he personally reads them. (File photo)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited suggestions from people for his Independence Day speech from Red Fort. “On 15th August, I get the opportunity to address the nation from Red Fort. I am merely the medium. It is not one person speaking, the voices of 125 crore citizens echo from there,” he said in his monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat, on Sunday.

PM Modi said that the suggestions can be sent through his website MyGov.in or through the Narendra Modi mobile application, where he personally reads them. “I’m happy to say that for the last three years, I get suggestions from every corner of the country for August 15, stating what I should speak about and what issues I should raise,” he said.

He also said that owing to the ‘complaints’ he has got over the length of the August 15 speeches he has given in the last three years, he will try to shorten it this time and wrap it up by 45-50 minutes.

While addressing the nation from Red Fort last year, PM Modi had expressed gratitude to the people of Balochistan, Gilgit and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. His remarks had drawn an angry reaction from Islamabad which claimed this “only proves Pakistan’s contention that India, through its main intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing, has been fomenting terrorism in Balochistan”.

PM Modi had also talked about the need for social unity. “A nation which is divided because of reasons like caste and religion cannot achieve great things,” he had said.

You can submit suggestions for PM Narendra Modi’s Independence day speech through his website or his mobile application.

Neymar hints his father was against PSG move,"Neymar has hinted that his father was against the PSG move. (Source: Reuters) Neymar has hinted that his father was against the PSG move. (Source: Reuters)

The Latest on Brazil soccer star Neymar’s move from Barcelona to PSG:

Neymar is hinting that his father was opposed to his signing with Paris Saint-Germain.

In a message posted on social media, Neymar says that “an athlete needs challenges. And for the second time in my life, I’ll contradict my father. Father, I understand and respect your opinion, but my decision is made and I ask you to support me as you always do.”

Neymar’s father, Neymar Santos Sr, is also his agent.

Hundreds of fans are lining up on the Champs-Elysees to get their hands on the first Paris Saint-Germain jerseys emblazoned with Neymar’s name after his world-record transfer.

The shirts cost 155 euros ($184).

When posters of the Brazilian, accompanied by the words “Welcome to a Paris Neymar Jr 10” were unveiled on windows of the flagship PSG club store, the crowd cheered.

Michael Biancolin, who had waited more than three hours, was the first fan to leave the store parading a yellow PSG shirt.

The 25-year-old Neymar is due to be presented to the media at the PSG stadium later Friday, a day after his 222 million-euro ($262 million) buyout clause from Barcelona was activated.

Mumbai by night: Sheds in Aarey Milk Colony,"The dairies do not follow a sterilisation process and send the milk directly to the customers’ homes. (File Photo) The dairies do not follow a sterilisation process and send the milk directly to the customers’ homes. (File Photo)

While people in the city snuggle up to sleep late in the night, in Aarey Milk Colony, those in the tabelas begin their day. The workers at the cattle sheds start their day in the late hours to ensure that milk reaches every home in time for the early morning coffee. Waking up at 2.30 am, the day’s work begins by bathing the animals. They are then fed and milking begins in an hour. I J Singh, a tabela owner in Unit 19 of the Milk Colony, has employed one person to take care of every 10 animals. “It takes around two hours to milk the 32 animals, both cows and buffaloes. By 5.30 am, we are done and the vehicles are ready to deliver milk to different parts of the city,” says Singh.

The dairies here do not follow a sterilisation process and send the milk directly to the customers’ homes. “We do not require to sterilise the milk. Big brands do it as they have to preserve the milk for a few days. Here, it reaches homes within hours of being milked. The customers boil it and generally consume the milk within a day,” Singh adds. The family has been in the dairy business for five generations now. Owing to the nature of the work, they need to live near their cattle sheds.

“We have to have our houses near the tabelas as we have to begin work in the early hours. Also, the animals need us to be around all the time. If any animal falls sick during the night, we have to be around to tend to it. Even people in the military can get an off from their work but we cannot. We have to be working all through the day,” says Singh.

"Kusal Mendis batted beautifully, Dimuth Karunaratne complemented him: R Ashwin","R Ashwin picked up his 26th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. (Source: AP) R Ashwin picked up his 26th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. (Source: AP)

Sri Lanka fought back in a perfect manner against India in the second Test after a follow-on was enforced on the home side in Colombo. Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne’s batting display provided the hosts with much-needed resistance as they ended day’s play 209/2. Earlier, India rode on R Ashwin’s fifer to bowl Sri Lanka out for 183 runs. The off-spinner in the presser after the day’s play told about the track and the way Sri Lankan batsmen’s batting performances.

Bowling on this surface

It had a bit of venom in the morning but as the ball got old and when we bowled the second time it started going out and it beat the bat a lot. Kusal Mendis batted beautifully. It put Jaddu (Ravindra Jadeja) off his line very quickly.

The difference in approach of Sri Lankan batsmen and Indian bowlers from the first session.

They did bat well. We did beat the bat pretty often but Karunaratne really batted well and complemented Mendis and credits to both of them. I don’t think we did too much wrong as we tried a variety of bowling. Pandya (Hardik) even got a wicket in the end.

Was the breeze different from the morning

There’s not much in the line of stumps to do. Also, the breeze started running and it was taking the ball away as you come closer to the stumps. In the morning I didn’t bowl a lot to the left-handers and there is something in the track if you bowl wider to the right-handers.

Talking about the track

The wicket is going to become slower and it’s not an easy work tomorrow. We gave away a few more runs that we shouldn’t have. Picking up early wickets is going to be very very important. The second new ball will definitely be very important. They have got a good partnership but tomorrow they will have to start from the scratch.

Take on enforcing the follow-on

Most of the time we have bestowed upon how tired the bowlers are. We thought this was the right time enforce the follow on and we thought the wicket will keep on slowing down and it’s not going to be easy as the game progresses to 4th or 5th day.

Felt depleted after the Kusal Mendis’ innings

The team feels depleted when somebody bats that well. But there was nothing to feel depleted about as we were able to beat them on a number of occasions.

What efforts do you need to turn the ball less when you are beating the batsmen so often?

We can change the angle which I tried to do.

Does it become tricky for a spinner when a batsman is able to hit you with cross bat despite getting beaten up number of times?

If you need to play the cross-routed shot, you really need to be very good at it. Some batsmen are really good at them.

What do you do when the batsman bats so aggressively?

For me, it’s trying to vary the pace and as I’m a tall bowler I try to get underneath the bat. I tried to go wider as well as bowled straighter.

Kevin Anderson stuns top seed Dominic Thiem in thriller at Citi Open,"Kevin Anderson defeated top seed Dominic Thiem. (Source: USA Today Sports) Kevin Anderson defeated top seed Dominic Thiem. (Source: USA Today Sports)

Big-serving South African Kevin Anderson squandered two match points before finally overcoming Austrian top seed Dominic Thiem in a compelling three-set slugfest at the Citi Open in Washington on Thursday. The clock had almost struck midnight when the 15th seed finally closed out the third-round match with his 21st ace to seal a 6-3 6-7(6) 7-6(7) victory in a little under three hours.

In a high-quality contest, 45th-ranked Anderson seemed to have frittered away his chances when he wasted a first match point in the second set but regrouped mentally and even survived a match point against him in the deciding tiebreak.

Anderson’s power game is ideally suited to the super-slick centre court surface at Rock Creek Park that has officially been measured as faster than Wimbledon and the Australian Open.

Thiem staved off defeat the first time after an 11-stroke rally culminated with a whipped forehand winner into the corner that Anderson could only watch helplessly as it whistled past.

The Austrian then captured the next two points of the tiebreak to level the match at one set apiece and send the contest into an exciting decider.

“I felt I had it in the second set but I tried to stay as positive as possible,” 31-year-old Anderson told Tennis Channel.

“I was down two breaks in the third but kept fighting and managed to play some of my better tennis.”

In quieter surroundings on an outside court, Indian world number 200 Yuki Bhambri continued his dream run.

After taking out defending champion Gael Monfils in the second round, Bhambri produced a successful encore to beat Argentine Guido Pella 6-7(5) 6-3 6-1 and set up a quarter-final encounter with Anderson.

As play extended into Friday morning, Alexander Zverev beat American Tennys Sandgren 7-5 7-5 in a match that finished at 1:25 a.m. local time, with the German advancing to meet Russian Daniil Medvedev in the quarter-finals.

Japanese second seed Kei Nishikori’s match ended 20 minutes later as he saw off Argentine Juan Martin Del Porto 6-4 7-5 to advance to the quarters, where he will face American Tommy Paul.

In women’s action, top seed Simona Halep recovered from a poor start to beat Colombian Mariana Duque 3-6 6-4 6-2.

However, second seed Kristina Mladenovic could not avoid an upset when the Frenchwoman was thrashed 6-2 6-3 by Canadian 17-year-old Bianca Andreescu.

Next up for 167th-ranked Andreescu is a quarter-final against German Andrea Petkovic, who blanked Canadian Eugenie Bouchard in the third set for a 6-2 4-6 6-0 victory.

Mumbai University result chaos: About 2.44 lakh answer sheets yet to be corrected,"After missing the July 31 deadline, Mumbai University officials had said that all results would be declared by August 5 but the slowdown in assessment has led to speculation over further delay in the results. After missing the July 31 deadline, Mumbai University officials had said that all results would be declared by August 5 but the slowdown in assessment has led to speculation over further delay in the results.

A DAY ahead of the extended August 5 deadline for the University of Mumbai to declare its final year examination results, 2.44 lakh answersheets were still to be corrected. Only 25,762 answer sheets were assessed on Friday, hinting at a further delay in declaration of results. The speed of assessment, which had spiked last week, has reduced after teachers resumed their routine teaching duties from Monday.

While last week, around 3,000 teachers corrected one lakh papers a day, this week the assessment has been restricted to around 25,000. After missing the July 31 deadline, varsity officials had said that all results would be declared by August 5 but the slowdown in assessment has led to speculation over further delay in the results.

Around 2 lakh commerce stream papers are to be corrected. The university is gradually declaring results of exams with a lower number of students. On Friday, 25 results were declared, taking the total to 254.

"Darjeeling shutdown: on day 52, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha calls for ‘Tiranga’ rally","GJM supporters holding a rally for separate Gorkhaland in Darjeeling. (Source: PTI) GJM supporters holding a rally for separate Gorkhaland in Darjeeling. (Source: PTI)

Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) chief Bimal Gurung on Saturday gave a call for a ‘Tiranga’ rally on August 8, as the indefinite strike in Darjeeling Hills, demanding a separate state of Gorkhaland, entered the 52nd day. The rally will coincide with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for the same to mark the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement. Only, the rally, to be taken out in Darjeeling Hills, will be a call to end the “colonial Bengali rule” and raise slogans such as ‘Bengal — Darjeeling Chodo’.

In a statement, Gurung said: “It has been decided that the Darjeeling Hills, Terai and Dooars will also be participating in the Tiranga Yatra. Just as how the British had enslaved us Indians and exploited and tortured us, the West Bengal government has also kept the people in Darjeeling Hills, Terai and Dooars in a slave-like condition. Despite 70 years since Independence, people living in our region have not been accorded any freedom, we are still living under colonial rule.’’

He added that the rally in Darjeeling will not only celebrate “our glorious freedom struggle” but protest “Bengal’s colonial rule” and therefore, will be marked with slogans such as ‘Bengal — Darjeeling Chodo’.

The last rally taken out by GJM supporters in Sukna near Siliguri had seen widespread violence and clashes between police and protesters. Meanwhile, while rallies are being taken out consistently in the Hills for a separate state, the Gorkha leadership has shifted its base to New Delhi, where it held an all-party meeting on August 1. GJM general Secretary Roshan Giri, however, said party leaders were yet to meet the central leadership to discuss the issue of the separate state.

Earlier, the GJM had unilaterally decided — despite setting up of Gorkhaland Movement Coordination Committee comprising parties and outfits in the Hills — that unless there was progress in discussing the issue and the Centre made concerted efforts by August 8, it would intensity its movement from August 9, calling a total shutdown of the Hills, in which even vehicles would not be allowed to ply. Residents have been been told to “stock up” on rations and essential goods, said sources. GJM supporters on Saturday took out rallies in various parts of the Hills, demanding restoration of Internet services, which have been suspended since June 18, and an immediate withdrawal of police personnel from the region.

"Some scientists to take to the streets for the ‘cause of science’, others to stay away","One of the key issues, said an organiser, was that there has been no significant increase in budgetary allocations for both basic sciences and training over the years. (File) One of the key issues, said an organiser, was that there has been no significant increase in budgetary allocations for both basic sciences and training over the years. (File)

As members of the scientific community gear up to take to the streets on August 9 for the “cause of science”, many within the fraternity say they are not “fully convinced” about participating in the march. At least 300 scientists and academicians from Pune have signed up for the march, which aims at the “betterment” of science.

According to the organisers, the march is against the way science is being nurtured in India, claiming that the government in power is not doing enough for the scientific community.

One of the key issues, said an organiser, was that there has been no significant increase in budgetary allocations for both basic sciences and training over the years. He also highlighted how India spends less than one per cent of its GDP in research projects. “We are uniting to not only create awareness about the importance of scientific temperament, but also to stand up for scientists against the government’s approach towards undertaking scientific activities,” said one of the organising members.

However, sources said, some of the seniors from the fraternity were either not fully aware or didn’t wish to extend their support to the cause. Organisers from the Pune chapter of ‘March for Science’ told The Indian Express that scientists representing some of the most renowned institutions, including Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER), Agharkar Research Institute (ARI) and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), have confirmed their participation in the march.

Academicians associated with the science faculties of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Modern College, Poona College of Pharmacy are also expected to join.

Pune is home to several institutions working under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Ministry of Defence (MoD), and a sizeable number of colleges involved in research work. No scientist from TIFR-National Centre for Radio Astronomy (NCRA) and National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) are joining the march.

Expressing his unwillingness to participate, Shekhar Mande, director, NCCS, said, “We are a publicly-funded centre and cannot go against the government in this manner. Yes, I agree that the budget allocation must improve but as a representative of the institute, I do not agree with the other issues raised by organisers.”

A handful of scientists and research fellows associated with Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) have also enrolled for the march but the institution, in its official capacity, said it will not get involved, added sources.

On the march and what forced scientists to take to the streets, director of ARI, KM Paknikar, said, “It is wrong on the government’s part to think that scientists are not doing anything worthwhile. Instead, they must identify key challenges and throw tasks, which are both time-bound and also focused towards solving problems faced by the society.” “Indian scientists are capable of undertaking any research work and the government must change its existing perception,” added Paknikar.

Another institute, which has decided to “stay out”, is TIFR-NCRA. “NCRA is not getting involved in the march and neither has any individual scientist expressed interest to show up,” said S K Ghosh, director, NCRA.

Like other IISERs in the country, scientists at the Pune branch are taking the lead in coordinating the event. While the Pune chapter is heading the ‘March for Science’ in the city, Director K N Ganesh seemed to know little about the movement. Talking to The Indian Express, Ganesh said, “I am not aware of the details of the protest. I will not be participating in the march, as I won’t be in the city on the scheduled day.”

Senior faculty members and students at IUCAA have, meanwhile, confirmed their participation. “Since the activity is being organised for the first time, there is a lot of enthusiasm among students and researchers. Senior members of the faculty and scientists from IUCAA will be present at the march,” said one of the organising members of the institute. The ‘March for Science’ will be held in three cities of Maharashtra — Pune, Mumbai and Wardha. The nationwide march will also be seen in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad, Bhubaneshwar, Allahabad and Chandigarh.

"After a fight with coal pollution, Haji Bunder celebrates clean air with football tournament","Indra Nagar football team at BPT ground,Reay Road. (Express photo by Kevin DSouza) Indra Nagar football team at BPT ground,Reay Road. (Express photo by Kevin DSouza)

Until two years ago, children in Indira Nagar at Haji Bunder sneaked out of their homes to play football and on their way back, erased all evidence that could have indicated they had been out in the coal-filled air. On Saturday, with the blackness gone from sight, they breathed in air cleaner than ever before to win a football match in the coal-free area.

The locality surrounding Haji Bunder in Sewri had become synonymous with tonnes of imported coal forming mountains on the 13 acres of land and black sooty dust carried by the wind would coat homes in Indira Nagar and the Indian Maritime University (IMU) and Lal Bahadur Shastri College of Advanced Maritime Studies and Research. The only road leading out of Haji Bunder sees round-the-clock movement of trucks bearing heavy cargo, which included coal until two years ago.

It was only after NGO, Aapli Mumbai, filed a Public Interest Litigation in the Bombay High Court asking that the Mumbai Port Trust stops coal handling in the city that the eastern seafront was rid of coal pollution. Acting under the court’s directions, the port trust finally decided to end coal handling in October 2015.

Still, it took at least a year to clean up the area.

A N S Neti, an engineer officer at the IMU, points from his third floor office towards vegetation around the campus that has never been greener. “Everything out there was covered in black. Every day, we had to clean the walls of the buildings because they would be covered in coal dust,” he said. Students at the university, who live in hostels on the campus, also suffered. Neti said several students in the previous batches suffered respiratory disorders.

Closing in on two years of being coal-free, Aapli Mumbai felt that a friendly football tournament on the ground that pollution had rendered under-utilised would make for a good celebration. The tournament that has eight teams participating kicked off last Saturday and with one game played every week, it will conclude in November.

“We are trying to tell people that they should come here and play in the clean air,” said R Balakrishnan, Vice- President, Aapli Mumbai.

Saturday was the first game for one of two home teams, Indira Nagar’s I N Strikers, a club founded only two years ago. “Earlier, we had become used to living and playing in air full of coal dust. That made a lot of us sick. Each time we walked from home to the ground, our legs would be covered in black sludge,” said Khatal Hussain (20).

Having contracted tuberculosis after growing up in Indira Nagar, it was only a combination of drastically improved air quality and a few months outside Mumbai that cured Hussain. “The coal dust flying from the trucks made it impossible to see anything on the road,” he said.

While many of the boys in the Strikers squad trained with the NGO, Magic Bus, that first set up serious football coaching in the area a few years ago, living in a densely polluted locality has clearly taken a toll on their bodies.

“Look at how skinny we are. It is not like we don’t eat but when the air here has been so bad for so long, we are bound to look weak,” said an 18-year-old player from the team. However, in the two 20-minute halves that they played on Saturday evening, the Strikers outclassed their old and beefier opponents in F C Dadar and winning 1-0.

“That is because we don’t give up. We know the kind of living conditions we grew up in. And now, we are very happy that the air is clean,” said Mayur, another player in the Strikers team.

Vijender Singh continues to remain the King,"Vijender Singh won his ninth bout in the professional boxing ring when he beat Zulpikar Maimaitiali of China in a unanimous decision at the NSCI Complex in Worli, Mumbai. The Indian boxer won an extremely close bout that was adjudged 96-93, 95-94 and 95-94 by the three judges that stretched his unbeaten streak to 9-0 even though Vijender would feel lucky to have come out with a win. (Source: AP)

At the end of the bout, Vijender made a surprising request and announced that he wished to return his newly acquired belt so as to alleviate the tension across the Indo-China border. “I want to dedicate this win to India-China friendship! There is some tension at the border, need peace. I don’t want the title, for peace and harmony at the border between India-China I will give it back to Maimaitial,” he said to the surprise of many.

Vijender was being cheered by a number of Bollywood actors and Amitabh Bachchan made it special for the boxer. (Source: PTI)

With the win, Vijender now holds both the WBO Oriental Super Middleweight and the WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title, which he already held, but his decision to hand the title back is a rare request which would be up to the officials. (Source: AP)

On the bout that went all the way with both men going hammer and tongs for the ten rounds, Vijender looked weaker as the match went on with Zulpikar drawing in with some meaty jabs. (Source: PTI)

The impact started to be felt on Vijender’s face who was bleeding by the eighth round. The boxer from Bhiwani acknowledged that it was a tough bout and something he didn’t expect – even with some jabs by Zulpikar’s being considered unsporting.

A Massachusetts woman who encouraged her boyfriend to kill himself in dozens of text messages and told him to “get back in” a truck filled with toxic gas, faces up to 20 years in prison when a judge sentences her on a charge of involuntary manslaughter. Michelle Carter was convicted by a judge who said her final instruction to Conrad Roy III caused his death.

Carter will be sentenced on Thursday. She was 17 when the 18-year-old Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014. Her’s lawyer argued that Roy was determined to kill himself and nothing Carter did could change that. Roy’s aunt has asked the judge to sentence Carter to the 20-year maximum. Carter’s father said his daughter made “a tragic mistake.” He’s asking for probation and continued counseling.

Bogeyman Justin Gatlin booed as Usain Bolt’s saintliness shines,"United States’ Justin Gatlin won the gold medal in the Men’s 100m final during the World Athletics Championships in London. (Source: AP) United States’ Justin Gatlin won the gold medal in the Men’s 100m final during the World Athletics Championships in London. (Source: AP)

The boos hailed down from every part of the London Stadium. As he knelt down in tears on the track, 56,000 voices jeered him unmercifully. In the outside world, within minutes, his Wikipedia profile had become Justin “the Cheat” Gatlin.

In the history of sport, you were forced to ponder, had there ever been a champion more universally unloved than Gatlin, the twice doping offender who by winning world 100 metres gold on Saturday had ruined one of sport’s great fairytale farewells.

It was supposed to be all about Usain Bolt. The idea of the world’s greatest athlete not winning his final individual race was like Olivier fluffing his lines in his final Hamlet or Nureyev taking a tumble in his farewell performance of Swan Lake. Unthinkable.

Yet what was really unimaginable, the sport’s doomsday scenario almost, was that as the sport’s spotless “saviour” was bowing out with his first defeat in any 100m final for four years, it would be the much-maligned Gatlin who would cash in.

Only two years ago, at the Beijing World Championships when Bolt outpaced Gatlin for the same title, it was hailed almost as good prevailing over evil.

“He saved his title, he saved his reputation, he may have even saved his sport,” screamed Steve Cram, the former 1,500 metres world record holder in the BBC commentary box.

So what had changed two years on?

In a world where drugs offenders are hardly thin on the ground, the 35-year-old American is still the bete noire of the anti-doping lobby, the man who has never shown any remorse and has thus received special opprobrium.

Yet hasn’t it reached almost farcical proportions? On Friday night in the first round, the stadium MC had noted amid all the cat-calling that the pantomime season was Christmas not in August. No matter; Gatlin was already cast in stone as their villain.

STONY-FACED

Yohan Blake, who has also served a drugs ban, was cheered to the rafters when he was introduced for the final but Gatlin just remained stony-faced through all the jeering. He has long become used to it. “I tuned it out,” he said.

“I did what I had to do. The people who love me are here cheering for me and my fellow countrymen are cheering at home.”

Of course, not all Americans will have been but even Bolt recognised after Gatlin had won in 9.92 seconds, just three-hundredths of a second ahead of him in the bronze medal position, that this reception did not feel fair.

Indeed, in this rarest of defeats, we may have seen the real greatness of Bolt revealed in a way we had never witnessed before.

Yes, the world has loved his once-in-a-century gift and his unmatched showmanship in all his triumphs. They have shown him as a great winner. Yet here he showed the world how to lose. With grace and honour. And, yes, forgiveness too.

Early in their career, Gatlin had once tried to psyche out Bolt when racing in an adjacent lane by spitting in it. So right from the start, Bolt could have been forgiven for really having it in for the American.

Yet even when anti-Gatlin feeling was most rife in the sport a couple of years ago, Bolt never sought to rub it in his foe’s face. Who was the first man congratulate Gatlin on Saturday? Of course, it was the Jamaican who went over to hug him with a genuine embrace.

“The first thing he did was congratulate me and say that I didn’t deserve the boos,” Gatlin revealed. “He is an inspiration.”

Who could argue with his judgement? Even as he contemplated such an anti-climactic end to his individual career, Bolt was big enough to pay a tribute to Gatlin which swam against the tide of ill-feeling.

“He (Gatlin) is a great competitor. You have to be at your best against him,” Bolt said. “I really appreciate competing against him and he is a good person.”

"Already proved to the world I’m one of the greatest athletes, says Usain Bolt","Usain Bolt of Jamaica reacts after the race. (Source: Reuters) Usain Bolt of Jamaica reacts after the race. (Source: Reuters)

Usain Bolt did not have a fairytale finish in his final 100 metres race as two-time drug cheat Justin Gatlin declared beat the Jamaican great in the last attempt. Bolt, however, said that he has already proven to the world that he is one of the greatest athletes.

After the race, Bolt said, “I’ve proved to the world I’m one of the greatest athletes. I don’t think this changes anything. I’ve done my part as an athlete, to uplift the sport and show it’s getting better. I can’t be too disappointed. I did my best. It’s hard to be sad with the energy that the crowd was giving me. They stayed and they shouted and they cheered.”

On Gatlin’s win, Bolt said, “I told him congrats and well done. He’s done his time over the years. Tonight he was the better man.”

Bolt added: “I put a little pressure on myself because I knew if I didn’t get my start and get into the race early, I might be in trouble. I got behind a little too much. I was behind and thought: ‘I have to work to get back in the race as quickly as possible.’ In the end, it wasn’t enough.”

“My start is killing me. Normally, it gets better during the rounds but it didn’t come together. And that is what killed me. I felt it was there.

The crowd that was there to witness history was disappointed as the London stadium booed the result. “Thanks for the support. I could never expect this from any other crowd. They are what pushed me to do my best. It is just one of those things. Thank you to London for all your love and appreciation. I’m just sorry I couldn’t deliver as I wanted,” he added.

"In his 50th Test, Cheteshwar Pujara knocks on the door of the pantheon","Cheteshwar Pujara became only the sixth Indian to celebrate his 50th Test with a hundred. (Source: Reuters) Cheteshwar Pujara became only the sixth Indian to celebrate his 50th Test with a hundred. (Source: Reuters)

Sometime during the Australia series this year, in the course of which Cheteshwar Pujara scored the most first-class runs in a season by an Indian, he was asked whether he was aware of the statistical embellishment. With a gentle smile playing on his lips, he replied in the affirmative.

It was unusual, as players dutifully feign ignorance of numerical milestones. Pujara, though, insisted it wasn’t an obsession. It’s not as if he wakes up and begins number-crunching straightaway, or heads into the match thinking what record he can break. It’s one of the means he measures his progress, to view his achievements through the prism of numbers, for numbers cold as they might be, are revelatory too.

While enjoying a quite evening at the team hotel after yet another high-quality hundred, he must have been enlightened about the records he surpassed or equaled during the innings (it will be wise if somebody in the support staff kept a stat-ready notebook). He became only the sixth Indian to celebrate his 50th Test with a hundred, the third (joint) fastest Indian to 4,000 runs, just behind Virender Sehwag and Sunil Gavaskar, and became the leading run-getter in Tests this year (838 runs from seven matches), eclipsing South African opener Dean Elgar. Even if you stretch the time frame to the August of 2016, no one has scored as many runs (1612 runs at 70.88) or faced as many deliveries as him (3309).

It could turn out to be that kind of a prolific season as Ricky Ponting enjoyed in 2003 or his successor Michael Clarke in 2012, wherein both aggregated 100-plus.

To nit-pick that this massive mountain of runs were piled at home or home-like conditions seems utterly churlish. For irrespective of the conditions or circumstances, it reveals a staggering consistency not even Virat Kohli could hit. Or even the other batting triumvirate of this era—Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith.

Equally pertinent is to assess the diverse circumstances — the situations that demanded different responses, conditions that warranted different methods — he had to endure this season. In Bangalore, he had to be, even by his standards, extremely focused. The reflexes and judgement needed to be razor-sharp, each stroke, defensive or otherwise, needed to be precise. It was such a vituperative pitch that where one lapse (sometimes no lapse at all) or imprudence could cost him. He played almost everything on the front-foot, often shimmying down to the pitch of the ball and and not allowing to ball to explode off the craters .

In Ranchi, through the epic double hundred, he shelved the drives, as the surface was getting increasingly difficult and playing through line wasn’t prudent. In Indore, against New Zealand, he had to accelerate because it was the third innings and India were setting a target. In Galle, it was about strike-rotation, as Shikhar Dhawan was blazing at the other end. In SSC, it was about stability. His wicket could have opened the floodgates, as there was some bite on the surface for the spinners. He had to preserve the wicket as well as tick the scoreboard along.

His methods too were different. In Galle, he’d habitually shimmy down the track for almost every other ball.

Here, the frequency was less and he was content turning the spinners round the corner from the back foot.

Such a batsman is a bowler’s nightmare, for they are uncertain how they can line them up. They can’t keep on flighting the ball hoping he would misjudge it. They can’t peg them on the back foot with sliders and flippers. They can’t wear him down with dot balls or seduce them into a trap.

Often, it’s taken for granted that Indian batsmen are well-versed in neutralising spin. But it hasn’t always been the case. For example, Kohli has contrived to get out four times in 10 innings against left-arm spinners this year alone.

Though in a different context, Sri Lanka coach’s chess analogy is so apt about Pujara as well. He said: “It’s like a game of chess. They make a move and then we make a move. The difference is that you don’t get much time to make that move.”

Rather, Pujara didn’t give them the time to make that move. The dextrous wrists, the nimble feet, the ticking brain and hawkish eyes tied them up in knots.

To think that his spot was impermanent and that he doesn’t squeeze into Kohli template of aggression around the same time last year seems blasphemous in hindsight. It’s also an insight into his inner steel belied in that he remained unflustered by such talks and demonstrated his immeasurable value.

His embodies Victorian values of patience and modesty.

But he is not a chip off the old block. He’s not like the 60s men who’d grind you to boredom and sleep. Neither is he is modern-day buccaneer, who’ll pound you to gasp. He is the perfect amalgam of the old and new, blending the virtues of both worlds. He’s essentially a 90s cricketer practising a craft that’s still relevant and will be relevant for as long as Test cricket exists. Dare we say, like Rahul Dravid?

The Dravid allusion arrived prematurely in his career. Even before the latter retired, Pujara was labelled as Dravid’s heir apparent. It had sometimes been a baggage for young Pujara, but now that he has stacked a heap of stats and achieved his 4,000th Test run in equal number of innings as his prototype, the comparisons and parallels can now begin in earnest. While numbers don’t reveal the whole picture, they do speak the truth.

India’s first innings win in Sri Lanka captures eighth consecutive series,"Ravindra Jadeja picked up five wickets as India completed their biggest win in Sri Lanka. (Source: AP) Ravindra Jadeja picked up five wickets as India completed their biggest win in Sri Lanka. (Source: AP)

The 304-run win in Galle was India’s best ever in Sri Lanka but they bettered it in the second Test by beating Sri Lanka by an innings and 53 runs on Sunday and took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Sri Lanka, following on, delayed the win till Tea on Day 4 but eventually lost the game after being bowled out for 386

Dimuth Karunaratne scored a splendid 141 but no other batsmen should spine on day four as Sri Lanka lost wickets in a heap in the second session of the day. Sri Lanka resumed at 209 for 2 and were behind by 230 runs. They scored 93 runs and lost two wickets in the second session but Karunaratne and Angelo Mathews defied the Indian spinners in the first session.

But, Ravindra Jadeja ran through the batting in the second session, picking up his ninth five-wicket haul in Test cricket. R Ashwin chipped in with three more as Sri Lanka crumbled, much like the pitch. Hardik Pandya and Umesh Yadav also picked up a wicket each.

This was India’s eighth series on the trot and only Australia have a better record with nine consecutive series win from 2005 to 2008. Virat Kohli also became the first captain to win two Test series in Sri Lanka.

Kei Nishikori fights off three match points to beat 225th-ranked Tommy Paul,"Kei Nishikori after beating Tommy Paul at Citi Open. (Source: USA Today Sports) Kei Nishikori after beating Tommy Paul at Citi Open. (Source: USA Today Sports)

Second seed Kei Nishikori shrugged off fatigue and saved three match points before beating unheralded American Tommy Paul 3-6 7-6(8) 6-4 in their Citi Open quarter-final on Friday.

The world number nine seemed destined for an early exit in the fierce Washington heat when 20-year-old Paul brought up match point at 5-3 in the second set with a backhand winner down the line.

Nishikori survived with an audacious drop shot from the base line that Paul could not run down, however, before staving off two more match points in the tiebreak and taking the second set.

That appeared to break the spirit of the 225th-ranked Paul and Nishikori, who had post-midnight finishes to his previous two matches at the tournament, took control in the final set to advance to Saturday’s semi-finals.

Next up for the 27-year-old Japanese is another 20-year-old in German fifth seed Alexander Zverev, who had too much in his arsenal for Russian Daniil Medvedev and won their quarter-final 6-2 6-4 in less than an hour.

“I felt good from the start to the end. It was a great match for me,” world number eight Zverev told Tennis Channel.

“I knew I had to take his time away, play my aggressive game and dominate as much as I could and it worked out very well today.

“Last year I didn’t come to the net very often. This year I’m trying new things, trying to be more aggressive. At times it’s working out.”

The other semi-final will pit American Jack Sock against South African Kevin Anderson in a battle of the big servers.

Sock won his quarter-final against Canadian third seed Milos Raonic 7-5 6-4, while Anderson came through a second three-setter in the space of 18 hours with a 6-4 4-6 6-3 victory over Yuki Bhambri of India.

“It was a really tough match tonight. Conditions were hot, it was a little gusty, balls were flying,” said Anderson, who did not get to bed until after 2 a.m. local time following his late night victory over top seed Dominic Thiem on Thursday.

In women’s action, top seed Simona Halep wilted in the afternoon heat and retired with fatigue at 2-6 6-3 1-0 down in her clash with Russian Ekaterina Makarova, who will play Oceane Dodin of France for a place in the final.

The other women’s semi-final will be an all-German affair with fourth seed Julia Goerges taking on unseeded compatriot Andrea Petkovic in an all German affair.

"Attack on Rahul Gandhi’s car: Goa Congress women wing to send bangles to PM Modi, Amit Shah","Banaskantha Superintendent of Police Neeraj Badgujar confirmed to The Indian Express that a stone was thrown at the car in which Rahul was on his way to the helipad after meeting flood victims at Dhanera. Banaskantha Superintendent of Police Neeraj Badgujar confirmed to The Indian Express that a stone was thrown at the car in which Rahul was on his way to the helipad after meeting flood victims at Dhanera.

The women’s wing of Goa Congress on Sunday said that it will send bangles to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah in protest against the attack on Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s car in Gujarat, news agency PTI reported. Gandhi visited the flood-affected areas of Dhanera and Kankrej in Gujarat’s Banaskantha district, where his car was hit by a stone on Saturday. It broke the vehicle’s rear left window.

Pratima Coutinho, Goa Pradesh Mahila Congress Committee said, “We are sending boxes of bangles, which we have collected from our homes, to Prime Minister Modi, BJP president Amit Shah and the persons who threw stones at our leader’s car.

On Saturday, the Gujarat Police also arrested Jayesh Darji, alias Anil Rathod, who is a local office bearer of the BJP’s youth outfit.

Coutinho called the incident a cowardly act against the person who had gone to help people suffering due to flood. Coutinho said, “India is a democratic country. Anybody can go anywhere without fear.”

Rahul alleged that workers belonging to the BJP and RSS were behind the attack on his car. He said, “Jo apne aap kaam karta hai, wo condemn kaise karega, (How can one, who is involved himself, condemn?)” the party vice-president said when asked about the absence of any statement from the PM condemning the attack on him. He also said, “Modi ji aur BJP-RSS ka rajneeti ka tareeka hai, kya keh sakte hain? (It is a way of Modi ji’s and BJP-RSS politics, what can one say?)”

“Narendra Modi ji’s slogans, black flags and stones will not stop us…. We will put in all our might into the service of people,” he had said on Twitter.

Congress leader Sachin Pilot who accompanied Gandhi during his Rajasthan visit to survey the flood situation said, “What sort of politics is the BJP government practicing? Allowing such attack on Rahul Gandhi’s vehicle. This must be condemned in the strongest terms.”

Musician alleges beaten up by staff at Turquoise Cottage in Green Park,"The photo shared by Sahil on his Facebook page The photo shared by Sahil on his Facebook page

A tribute gig at Turquoise Cottage in Green Park on Friday night took an ugly turn when two members of a metal band were allegedly roughed up by a bartender and two bouncers. Sahil Sharma, a 22-year-old guitarist with The Cosmic Truth, received stitches on his head after a fight broke out over the bar bill. Three FIRs have been filed at Safdarjung Enclave police station.

“Cross FIRs have been registered. There are three FIRs — one against bar manager Harpal Singh and others, filed by Sahil Sharma; one against Sharma, filed by the bar manager; and a third against Sharma and his brother, filed by a constable for quarrelling inside the PCR van. They abused him and tore his uniform, the constable alleged in his FIR,” said Additional DCP (south) Chinmoy Biswal.

After their hour-long performance at Turquoise Cottage, Sharma said he saw the band’s sound engineer, Mayank Tiwari, involved in an argument with the bartender over the bill. “I interfered when I saw another bartender, Harpal Singh, roughing up Mayank. I approached the bar manager who nodded and left… A while later, Harpal and two bouncers started punching and dragging me down a flight of stairs. I have stitches on my head because of this,” alleged Sharma.

Band member Jayant Bhadula, 23, said he was downstairs waiting for Sharma and Mayank when he found out about the fight. “Sahil was being carried out by two people… When we went inside to confront the management, the bouncers tried to fight us. I called police around 1 am,” he said. Gaurav Doral, owner of Turquoise Cottage, said, “We’ve been in this industry since 1997, we’ve always been respectful towards artistes. In this case, my staff politely asked them to step outside because they were creating a ruckus. According to our CCTV footage, Sharma slipped and hurt his head when he was being escorted out. I stand by my staff.”

A case under IPC sections 323, 341, 506 and 34 has been registered against Harpal Singh and others, while another case under IPC sections 341, 323, 506, 34 has been registered against Sharma. “When we called police, the constable who arrived treated us very poorly. He pushed me in the PCR by my neck, even though I was bleeding… Harpal intimidated me and my elder brother, and even punched me in the stomach in front of the constable,” alleged Sharma. A case under IPC sections 186, 332, 353, 34 has been registered against Sharma after an FIR was filed by the constable.

Rescue teams were searching for three US Marines missing after their aircraft crashed into the sea off Australia’s east coast on Saturday, the US Marine Corps said. Twentythree other personnel aboard the MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft had been rescued, the III Marine Expeditionary Force, based in Okinawa, Japan, said in a statement.

Ospreys have been involved in a series of incidents in past years. The aircraft had launched from the USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6), an amphibious assault ship, and was on regular operations when it hit the water, the statement said. Boats and aircraft on the ship immediately launched a search and rescue effort. The US Marine Corps said the incident was under investigation but gave no additional information.

The incident took place off the coast of Shoalwater Bay, in Australia’s northeastern state of Queensland, the Australian defence ministry said. One person had been taken to Rockhampton hospital, a Queensland Ambulance spokesman said. He gave no further details. The Bonhomme Richard Expeditionary Strike Group was in Australia to participate in joint training manoeuvres involving more than 33,000 US and Australian military personnel, which ended two weeks ago.

The exercises included the participation of MV-22 Ospreys practicing the deployment of US Marine reconnaissance teams. The Osprey, built by Boeing Co and Textron Inc’s Bell Helicopter and designed to take off like a helicopter and rotate its propellers to fly like a plane, has suffered a series of incidents in other parts of the world.

Its development was nearly cancelled after the deaths of 23 Marines during flight testing in 2000, but its speed and range have made it very popular in recent years. In December, the US military grounded its Osprey fleet in Japan, after one of the aircraft ditched into the sea, injuring its crew of five when a hose connected to the aircraft broke during a refuelling exercise. Australia has sent troops to fight in the US-led coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Donald Trump to go on two-week working vacation: White House,"US President Donald Trump (Files) US President Donald Trump (Files)

Donald Trump would go on a two-week working vacation to his golf club in New Jersey, his first holiday since he was sworn in as the US President in January.

Trump, who used to be critical of his predecessor Barack Obama taking his annual vacations to Hawaii and Martha’s Vineyard, would be spending his next two weeks at his private golf club in central New Jersey. “The President tomorrow will be taking off for Bedminster for a working vacation,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters told reporters abroad Air Force One travelling with him to West Virginia.

However, Walters defended Trump’s working vacation and argued that the duration would be used to improve upon the air conditioning and heating system in the West Wing of the White House, whose staff temporarily are relocating to the executive building within its complex. “The President is going to continue to work. We all need to be relocated out of the West Wing due to these renovations that should have taken place before,” Walters said.

“We are at a position that we’re now at a dire need, and they either need to be repaired or replaced. And it’s not something that can go on while we’re still occupying the West Wing. So the President will continue to work over the next two weeks,” Walters said.

Walters said the renovation plans had been approved by the previous administration, following the completion of the phase-1, but were never actually initiated. “In addition to these larger structural repairs, we will be renovating the Navy Mess kitchen, the West Wing lower lobby, and the IT system, and generic cosmetic upgrades,” Walters said.

Tales From the Coal Crypt,"Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973.

Let me start with the positives. Subhomoy Bhattacharjee’s book on India’s coal story has all the facts that a person might want to know about this industry. And I truly mean it — from July 1836 when, through Carr, Tagore and Company, Dwarkanath Tagore (Rabindranath Tagore’s grandfather), bought out a Raniganj mine in the district of Burdwan some 130 miles northwest of Kolkata, the nationwide scandal on coal block allocations triggered by the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report of August 2012 to Naveen Jindal’s foray into tapping the coal deposits of Mozambique. It is replete with information, hard facts, interviews and extremely plausible conjectures which makes the book an essential reference kit for anyone interested in this complex and messy industry.

Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. This was a cornerstone of Indira Gandhi’s nationalisation-driven socialist rule after the Bangladesh war and the bill was enthusiastically piloted by Mohan Kumaramangalam, a sophisticated and erudite trade union leader, an ex-Communist Party of India cadre and her minister for coal and mines. Describing the private sector mines as relics of the Middle Ages and instruments of human oppression, Kumaramangalam argued that if nationalisation was postponed by another 25 years, there would be little or no coal left for the country, barring uneconomical, hazardous units, underground fires and poorly paid workers. Coal nationalisation was Mohan Kumaramangalam’s last hurrah. Very soon afterwards, he was one of the 48 who died in a terrible Indian Airlines crash on 31 May 1973.

The next chapter, ‘Coal on Sale’, looks at the large scale illegal theft in the mining and sale of coal in the decade or so that followed nationalisation — the stuff that made multi-millionaires of thugs led by the infamous four-term MLA Surya Deo Singh who became the legend and godfather of Dhanbad, as well as others such as Babloo Srivastava, Brijesh Singh, Hari Shankar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi. A part of every transaction in the nationalised mines from recruitment to sales and transport had to be paid to these goons; nothing could work without their say-so and their cuts. Bhattacharjee then uses the theme of ‘coal on sale’ to transit from small to very large sales via Manoj Jayaswal, a hitherto unknown cricket-loving businessman from Nagpur and his application for a large coal block in Chhattisgarh; to be followed by Naveen Jindal and Sandeep Jajodia of Monnet Ispat.

That sets the stage for Bhattacharjee’s next chapter entitled, self-evidently, as ‘Notes from an Auditor’. It covers the famous CAG report under Vinod Rai’s tenure and goes into the entire coal mine leasing scam in great detail — including the irreparable political damage it caused prime minister Manmohan Singh, the intervention of the Supreme Court which nullified almost all hitherto held coal block auctions, and the travails of the coal secretary PC Parakh and his successor Harish Chandra Gupta. To my mind, it is the best chapter of the book.

After that, the book meanders over the next four chapters. To be sure, it looks into some key issues such as environmental brakes and the part that Jairam Ramesh played as the minister for environment and forests; the role of entrepreneurs; the cost of the failure of coal block auctions to the banking system, especially those that had large exposures in coal based power plants and associated mining rights; a foray into international acquisitions, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa; and on India’s energy ambitions. Each chapter has considerable information. However, these somehow do not hold together as part of a continuous book.

Which brings me to my basic criticism. Here is a book that has enough material to have become a classic on the subject. Yet, it begs a coherence of purpose and narrative that such a book demands. It is as if there are many informative journalistic copies, each structured in 600-word formats, but few flowing from one to the other, to create tightly knit chapters leading to an ‘un-put-down-able’ book. Unlike, for instance, the books of fellow journalists such as Andrew Ross Sorkin’s Too Big to Fail, William D. Cohen’s Money and Power, any of David Halberstam’s works and, nearer home, some of Arun Shourie’s books or TN Ninan’s Turn of the Tortoise, Bhattacharjee does not tie together the many fascinating micro-pieces into the structure of a consistently well reading book. Perhaps it reflects the absence of the publishing editor, who ought to have helped in this task. Also, there are some serious editorial shortfalls, the most obvious one being that, despite having a 14-page bibliography printed in a tiny font-size, there is not a single footnote or endnote in the text to correlate these with the references.

There are so many informative nuggets in this work which, if fused well, ought to have made for a great book. It is, no doubt, a sound reference guide. But it could have been so much more. And that’s the pity.

Extramarital sex more among older Americans,"The researchers found that just 14 per cent of those under age 55 said they had cheated on their spouses. The researchers found that just 14 per cent of those under age 55 said they had cheated on their spouses.

In a surprising discovery, a new study reveals that married people in the US over age 55 engage in extramarital sex more often than younger Americans. Based on analysis of data from the General Social Survey, the researchers found that just 14 per cent of those under age 55 said they had cheated on their spouses as compared with 20 per cent of married Americans over age 55 reporting they have had engaged in extramarital sex.

The General Social Survey has been monitoring trends and constants in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes of Americans since 1972. While the overall number of Americans who report having sex outside of marriage has held relatively steady at approximately 16 per cent over the past 30 years, that trend has obscured a startling age-related difference, according to the study published by the Institute for Family Studies.

Rates of extramarital sex by age have diverged since 2000, with increased cheating reported by people in their 50s and 60s, said study author Nicholas Wolfinger, Professor at University of Utah. These numbers are derived from GSS responses to the question, “Have you ever had sex with someone other than your husband or wife while you were married?” Survey respondents have been asked this question in each survey wave since 1991.

Most of these respondents were married between 20 years and 30 years. But there may be more going on than lengthy marriages and midlife crises, Wolfinger added. These older Americans also came of age in the wake of the sexual revolution and, over the course of their lifetimes, have had more sex partners compared to younger Americans. Also, while a majority of Americans continue to disapprove of extramarital sex, attitudes have softened, particularly among older survey respondents, the study said.

The General Social Survey asks respondents about extramarital sex, not explicitly adultery. This raises the possibility that the data reflect rising participation in polyamory or “ethical nonmonogamy,” extramarital relationships conducted with the active permission of one’s spouse. “No matter how many polyamorists there are on Thursday, old-fashioned adultery seems to have risen among older Americans,” Wolfinger said.

‘Congress should take credit for making Nitish CM. We made that a condition before the alliance’,"Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad with Senior Assistant Editor Manoj C G at The Indian Express office. Abhinav Saha Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad with Senior Assistant Editor Manoj C G at The Indian Express office. Abhinav Saha

MANOJ C G: What does Nitish Kumar joining hands with the BJP mean for Opposition unity?

There is a crude Dogri proverb, ‘Jithon di khoti othe ja khadhoti’. Animals such as sheep, cow, buffalo are tied at a particular point in the house (to ensure they don’t go away). But a female donkey, even if it is let loose, you will find it back standing at the same place… I think for him (Nitish Kumar) joining it (the Grand Alliance) was like trying out a new venture, but ultimately he would go where he had been for over 17 years. That was his original place. I would not give much credence to it. He was like a tourist — they get bored, go out and then come back home.

MANOJ CG: But is it not a setback for the Opposition?

Yes, it is. Who says it is not? As a matter of fact, I think, we depended on him too much. The Congress should take credit for making him the chief minister. We had a triangular alliance in Bihar — the Congress, JD(U) and RJD. We put a condition that we would have an alliance only if the JD(U) chief was made the CM. So, we rather forced the RJD to be a part of it. We didn’t say we will leave it to the JD(U) or the RJD to select the CM, we said our candidate will be Nitish Kumar. Pre-election… this is the announcement we made. This will be very surprising for you.

RAVISH TIWARI: In hindsight, do you think the Congress made a mistake?

See, in politics you have to trust. He (Nitish Kumar) said goodbye to the BJP, and he wanted to be part of the alliance, the UPA, a secular political party… We also saw that he has given up everything, he has come to us, let us support him and let him be the chief minister. If we had (not insisted), the fight would have been between him (Nitish Kumar) and Lalu Prasad. Lalu would have asked for even more seats because he had more base and the JD(U) base was divided between the BJP and the JD(U). But when we supported him (Nitish Kumar), the bargaining power of the RJD became far less. So our initial support to him was very crucial. After all this, he left… I don’t know if you should find fault with us or you should find fault with him for this move.

He is talking about corruption today, but that time too Laluji was disqualified. There is nothing new. Nitish Kumar was privy to the ins and outs of the family because he was the Chief Minister of Bihar, he was not an outsider. So whatever charges, frivolous or real ones, that are being levelled against Laluji, he always knew about them.

When the surgical strikes took place and were being debated in Parliament, he (Nitish Kumar) was the first to say that he doesn’t question them. When demonetisation took place, he was the first person to support it… So this is an excuse (corruption charges against Lalu Prasad). When your own allies — the RJD and Congress —and your leader in the House are fighting against demonetisation, how can he support the move and give a statement? So he was 90 per cent there (with the NDA), only one step was outside the door.

RAVISH TIWARI: 2015 was the first proof that the Opposition can form an alliance and take on the BJP. Has Nitish Kumar’s exit created doubts in the Congress about such an alliance in the future?

Things are changing, and there are so many elections before 2019. At the end of this year there are two state elections. In the beginning of next year there are two-three elections, and by the end of next year there are three more crucial elections. That is just six months before the Parliament elections. I think those elections will be the gamechanger. They are huge states. So, a lot of things will happen before the general elections take place and we have a lot of time to think and ponder. It is too early to think of a grand alliance.

MANOJ C G: The Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance was not enough to stop the BJP in Uttar Pradesh. Will you reach out to the BSP to form a grand alliance in UP?

The alliance (SP-Congress) was strong enough, and a very important one too. But in UP, the kind of polarisation I saw in the state, I have not seen anywhere in the country. I don’t think it was a contest between parties. The kind of WhatsApp messages that were sent to us by our own non-Muslim candidates, you cannot see those recordings. The mobile recordings which the family members (of our leaders, workers and candidates) sent us… there was no need for an election. Most of the recordings were of their (the BJP’s) women folk, addressing 50-70 people… it became an election between Hindus and Muslims. It wasn’t an election between parties. Forget Dalits, Yadavs, Jats, they were told you are all Hindus who have to fight against Muslims. If you are fighting in the name of religion, then there can’t be any election. That is also the reason that Mayawati fared so poorly, because they said forget Dalits, you are Hindus first. If this is the way the BJP is going to contest elections in the country, then how can anybody win? It is very difficult to fight religion.

ANAND MISHRA: The Congress has ruled the country for a very long time. Why is it finding it difficult to find traction among Hindu voters now?

The Congress party is very different from the present ruling party. The Congress was everybody’s party, it was India’s party. There was no Hindu, Muslim, Dalit, Sikh. It is not a religious party. The RSS is based on religion, the Congress is not. Our thinking and the thinking of the RSS — the present BJP government is an RSS government — is not the same.

You hear of lynchings, Dalits are being butchered everyday, that doesn’t gel with the Constitution of India. This is a totally different BJP government from Atalji’s (Atal Bihar Vajpayee’s) government. This is a totally different BJP, which we are alien to, or they are alien to our thinking. We understood the BJP of Atalji.

MUZAMIL JALEEL: But given the BJP’s electoral victories, do you think there is acceptance for their politics in the country?

Sixty-nine per cent of the country did not vote for the BJP (in the 2014 general elections). If all Hindus were communal, then you would not have seen the ‘Not in My Name’ protests across all state capitals in the country. All the protesters were 99.9 per cent Hindus. An overwhelming number of Hindus in our country are secular. As I say, and even the Hindus say, their religion is more liberal than any other religion. No other religion can be more liberal. The religion is not the spoiler, it is the government.

MUZAMIL JALEEL: But then why is the Congress getting defeated in state after state?

The 69 per cent (of non-BJP voters) is divided. The day they get united… Who is fighting the BJP today? It is not the Muslims. It is the Hindu writers, the Hindu intelligentsia. You see them on television, you read their write-ups and you hear them in Parliament. I see UP election as an aberration. I am sure before the next general elections the right-thinking people will come to the conclusion that if the BJP government stays for long it will not be in the interest of the country.

VANDITA MISHRA: Don’t you think when Nitish Kumar first started supporting the Centre, demonetisation onwards, there is something that you could have done to hold on to him? Similarly in UP, did you try to break the narrative that the BJP sold, did you do enough? What do you have to say about the Congress’s inadequacies in the case of Nitish Kumar and in Uttar Pradesh?

Yes, the inadequacies are there. We are not a strong party in UP, we are very weak there. We have always been No. 4-5 in the state for the past 30 years. But the way they polarised the elections, even the strong parties were finished. I don’t know what we could have done in Nitish’s case. When he supported demonetisation, we thought maybe he was just trying to get some economic package for the state. We never thought that he is going to merge with them. It is almost a merger. The statement that he gave the other day, that Modiji will not be challenged in 2019, that even a BJP worker or leader hasn’t said. So he is a few steps ahead of them. He is not fighting as an opposition leader, he is fighting to get a better place in the BJP, than his BJP colleagues.

ANAND MISHRA: Is it not tragic for the Congress that you now have to depend on regional party leaders — Lalu Prasad, Mamata Banerjee, Akhilesh Yadav — during elections. A party that has ruled the country for so long can’t find a single leader of its own to take on the BJP in the states?

That’s true. We ruled for so long, but we neglected the party. There is no doubt about it. Whether it was the national or state level, the thrust was on governance and not on the party. The time which we should have given to organisation and organisers at state and national level, we totally forgot about it, and now we are paying for that.

ANAND MISHRA: The BJP may not have many strong state leaders, but their central leadership is strong, they are winning in the name of Narendra Modi. Do you think there is a leadership crisis in the Congress at the central level?

I am not in favour of that kind of leadership, because that leadership is dictatorial in nature. In democracy, you must have leaders, not a leader. They may have a leader but there is no democracy.

ABANTIKA GHOSH: Raids in Karnataka, raids on properties owned by Lalu Prasad’s family, there seems to be this dominant narrative that the Opposition is corrupt and the government isn’t. Is it a failure of the Opposition to highlight anything or is it really a very clean government?

Give me 10 days. The amount of money that the BJP is spending in Parliament, the amount spent on helicopters and aircraft by the BJP in Assembly elections… During the Bihar Assembly polls, the BJP had 26 helicopters and six jets. The Congress had one, the JD (U) had two rickety ones and the RJD had one. Which of the (BJP) ministers or party leaders have the factories to generate this type of money? How are they getting so many helicopters and aircraft in every election?

They have the power, so they use it. You give me that same power and I will give you tonnes of money from BJP ministers and their party offices and leaders. Where were these helicopters five year ago? You say we have been in power for 60-70 years, but in how many districts and state capitals do we have offices? You see, within three years, there will be (BJP) offices across the country, including in Srinagar, Kashmir. In all of the 650 districts. Where is the money to purchase land for these offices coming from?

Everybody gets the same pay. Who is paying for this? Is this not corruption? I have told the PM in the House that ‘you are saying corrupt, corrupt, corrupt’ because you have the agencies to raid people. I am not saying that they may not be correct. But then, in the evening, you give these cases to some selected channels. The Prime Minister says that there is not a single blame on me. How can there be any blame? If we had not set up an inquiry in 2G (spectrum case), how would you have come to know? How would have anybody come to know? In our time, should anything come in the media, either print or electronic, the next day we would order an inquiry.

AAKASH JOSHI: You said that the BJP is polarising, but shouldn’t you be able to counter that? What is the Congress’s ideological message now? Take lynchings in the name of the cow, Mamata Banerjee is the only opposition politician to come out and say that people should be allowed to eat what they want. A simple statement like that has not come from the Congress party.

We have a clear message. We have said cow slaughter is banned and the law should take its own course. We have said that in the name of the cow we shouldn’t lynch people. We raised this in Parliament as well. Hindus are getting lynched, Hindus are killing Muslims, Dalits are getting killed, Congressmen are getting killed, BJP men are getting killed, RSS men are getting killed… In Kashmir, Muslims are killing Muslims. As much as I have opposed lynching here, I have opposed the lynching of (DSP) Ayub Pandith in Kashmir as well, where Muslims lynched a Muslim. In Kerala, a CPM man killed an RSS man. We condemned it with all force at our command.

JYOTI MALHOTRA: But nobody seems to be listening to the message of the Congress party.

Because all the messengers, barring a few, work for the BJP. In our time, there was a democracy. And the fourth estate, the pillar of our democracy, was free. This is an era of technology and television. How many channels in this country have the freedom to speak out against the government? How many channels can speak the truth about what is happening in the country? (If they do), they won’t survive for more than 24 hours.

ABANTIKA GHOSH: The Congress could not even decide whether its vice-president had met the Chinese ambassador or not. Why should anybody take the Congress message seriously?

When you are meeting an ambassador, it is not publicised. Who I meet or not meet, how is the entire party going to know about it? When the ambassador meets the Congress vice-president, it is not put out on TV. He is not the head of the State, or the head of the government. The meeting was not such a big thing that the entire party has to know about it. It was a meeting between two individuals.

MUZAMIL JALEEL: What do you think is happening in Kashmir?

In March 2015, I had told the Prime Minister that the greatest blunder you are making is forming a government in J&K with the PDP. I told him that the way you are going to enter Kashmir and the Northeast, one day you will repent it. I said the BJP and the RSS are red rags for the people of Kashmir. I told him please don’t make this blunder. It is a very sensitive area. A very difficult area. I said look at us, the Congress, that in spite of being in government for decades, the people of Kashmir have not recognised us. We don’t get more than four to five seats. If they have not recognised us, the Congress, how can you expect them to have faith in the BJP?

I also warned him that I knew why he was doing it. You want to be like Alexander — conquer the whole country, even Kashmir. ‘Not conquered by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, I conquered’. So I told him not to undertake that kind of misadventure.

Air India flight delayed due to ‘technical glitch’ at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport,"The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs last month gave its in-principle approval for disinvestment of Air India. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs last month gave its in-principle approval for disinvestment of Air India.

Passengers of Delhi-bound Air India flight AI 809 were left stranded at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA) on Saturday afternoon following a technical glitch in the aircraft. Passengers on board claimed that they were stranded for three to four hours without the air conditioning system working.

Passengers complained of suffocation due to no electricity inside the flight. “We waited inside the flight for almost two hours. No food was served. It was a disappointing service,” Pratik Jain, a passenger on board the flight said.

Others complained of missing connecting flights in the day due to the delay. The Air India flight that was supposed to depart Mumbai airport at 11.30 am, left at 2.15 pm. “The flight was delayed due to technical glitch.We have set up an inquiry committee to investigate the delay in the Mumbai-Delhi-Jeddah flight,” an Air India spokesperson said.

A recognition for me and para-athletes: Coach Satyanarayana,"Mariyappan had been recommended for the Arjuna Award a couple of days ago, which Satyanarayana said was a good thing to happen for para-athletics. (Source: Reuters) Mariyappan had been recommended for the Arjuna Award a couple of days ago, which Satyanarayana said was a good thing to happen for para-athletics. (Source: Reuters)

Noted athletics coach Satyanarayana, mentor of T Mariyappan, who won a gold in the Rio Paralympics last year, says being recommended for the prestigious Dronacharya Award is a recognition not for him alone but for para-athletes too.

“I am happy not only for myself, but even for my students too. It is because of their success, I have been chosen for the award,” he told PTI from Bengaluru.

Mariyappan had been recommended for the Arjuna Award a couple of days ago, which Satyanarayana said was a good thing to happen for para-athletics.

“Mariyappan’s gold in Rio brought me to the limelight. Other students of mine like H N Girisha, a silver medallist at the Paralympic Games in London recently and Varun Bhati won a bronze in the men’s high jump T-42 category in Rio, have given me a lot of cheer. I am happy that Mariyappan has been selected for the Arjuna Award, it is a boost for para-athletes,” he said.

A former 1,500-metres runner, who has taken part in international events, Satyanarayana was an administrator with

Karnataka Amateur Athletics Association (KAAA) before taking up coaching.

“I moved to coaching from administration as I felt I could not give my best. Moreover, since I thought I would be better off training and motivating athletes, I took up the job of coaching athletes. I am enjoying it and it is wonderful to work with para-athletes,” he said.

“From the days when I sold flowers in Shimoga (now Shivamoga) to taking up athletics and representing India in international meets to a coach, it has been a good journey,” he said of his humble beginnings and his subsequent role as a trainer.

“I can’t say how happy I am to be recommended for the Dronacharya award. However, it has not happened because of my hard work alone. A lot of people have been behind this. I have to be grateful to the people of Shimoga, my students and many others for the good things that have happened to me,” he said.

“The award increases my responsibility. My desire is to see Mariyappan, Girisha and Bhati train hard and win medals at the 2020 Paralympics,” he said.

Satyanarayana also said that J M Shawad, one of his trainees, had a lot of potential, and tipped him to win medals

in the future.

“I get a lot of satisfaction coaching athletes. My small help has enabled people like Girisha, Mariyappan, Bhati win medals in world-level events. I hope to continue my contribution to Indian sport, especially para-athletics,” he signed off.

Al-Qaeda attack kills six soldiers in southern Yemen,"Al-Qaeda militants remain active in southern Yemen where they have exploited the security gap created by the conflict between Hadi’s supporters and the Huthi rebels. (Representational image) Al-Qaeda militants remain active in southern Yemen where they have exploited the security gap created by the conflict between Hadi’s supporters and the Huthi rebels. (Representational image)

Six soldiers of a new anti-jihadist force formed by the United Arab Emirates were killed and others were abducted in an Al-Qaeda suicide bombing in southern Yemen, a Yemeni military official has said. The suicide bomber on Wednesday blew up his vehicle next to a military position recently set up by the Yemeni force in Shabwa province, the official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Two vehicles belonging to the anti-jihadist force were destroyed in the attack, which left an undetermined number wounded while other soldiers were abducted by Al-Qaeda members supporting the suicide bomber, he added. The official said the victims belong to an “elite unit” set up by the United Arab Emirates, one of the key partners in the Saudi-led coalition which intervened in Yemen in 2015 to support President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi against Shiite Huthi rebels.

Al-Qaeda militants remain active in southern Yemen where they have exploited the security gap created by the conflict between Hadi’s supporters and the Huthi rebels. The conflict in Yemen pits Huthi rebels and supporters of ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh against forces loyal to the internationally recognised president Hadi.

The war has killed more than 8,000 people, mostly civilians, and wounded 44,500 since Saudi Arabia and its allies intervened against the rebels it says are supported by regional arch-rival Iran.

Andrius Gudzius wins discus throw gold for Lithuania in stunning fashion at World Championships,"Andrius Gudzius won the gold medal with a throw of 69.21m. (Source: AP) Andrius Gudzius won the gold medal with a throw of 69.21m. (Source: AP)

Lithuanian Andrius Gudzius, a one-time junior prodigy, finally fulfilled expectations to shock the big names in the discus and take gold at the World Athletics Championships on Saturday. The 26-year-old, who had won the world junior title back in 2010 but had never since come close to threatening the elite in his event, prevailed with a second-round throw of 69.21 metres, the best of his life.

His winning effort came immediately after Sweden’s Daniel Stahl, the event favourite as the only man to throw over 70 metres this season, had launched a 69.19m throw. Stahl ended up with the silver and American Mason Finley took the bronze with a personal best 68.03m.

“Every athlete must be dreaming about the world title and I managed it tonight. I still cannot believe it and I think I need some time to understand what has just happened,” a stunned Gudzius said afterwards.

Gudzius, whose previous best performance in the senior ranks was a European Under-23 triumph in 2013, showed little emotion as he became only the second Lithuanian man ever to win a world title following his great discus throwing predecessor Virgilijus Alekna.

Alekna, who won in 2003 and 2005, was also double Olympic champion and his feats had led Lithuanians to heap expectations on his potential successor, even though Gudzius had only finished 12th in last year’s Olympics.

“I was thinking about a medal but I did not expect gold. Everybody in my country was expecting a medal from me and I am happy to bring one home,” he said.

Still, it had seemed a tall order for Gudzius to emulate Alekna with a couple of the event’s greats in the field.

Yet neither Germany’s Robert Harting, who won the Olympic title in the London Stadium in 2012, nor Poland’s reigning champion Piotr Malachowski, who had captured the last four world titles between them, could find their range.

Harting ended up sixth with his first-round throw of 65.10m while Malachowski was fifth with a fifth-round effort of 65.24m.

Jamaican Fedrick Dacres, another former world junior champion, produced a fourth round throw of 65.83m to earn fourth place.

Earthquake in central Oklahoma leaves hundreds in the dark,"The US Geological Survey initially reported the 4.4- magnitude tremor was detected at 9:56 pm on Wednesday about 4 miles (6 kilometers) east-northeast of Edmond, Oklahoma about 15 miles (25 kilometers) northeast of Oklahoma City. The US Geological Survey initially reported the 4.4- magnitude tremor was detected at 9:56 pm on Wednesday about 4 miles (6 kilometers) east-northeast of Edmond, Oklahoma about 15 miles (25 kilometers) northeast of Oklahoma City.

An earthquake registering 4.2 on the richter scale in central Oklahoma, US, damaged power supply lines, disrupting supply to hundreds of customers. The US Geological Survey (USG) had initially said that the 4.4 magnitude tremor was detected at 9:56 pm on Wednesday about 4 miles (6 kilometers) east-northeast of Edmond, about 15 miles (25 kilometers) northeast of Oklahoma City. The USG Slater revised the shock down to a magnitude 4.2. Edmond officials said two electric substations were knocked out, darkening the northeastern part of the city and leaving about 1,900 customers without power.

Electricity was restored to one of the substations after about an hour of being offline. No significant damage was reported, the police department said on Twitter. The quake was the sharpest of six tremors detected in the Edmond area over a 24 hour period. Scientists have linked some oil and gas production in Oklahoma to an uptick in earthquakes, but the frequency of shocks had dropped recently as the state imposed restrictions on the injection of wastewater into underground disposal wells.

"Visitors stopped at gate, tempers flare at Gurgaon condominium","Tenants said they tried to resolve the matter by offering to show identification for their guests. Tenants said they tried to resolve the matter by offering to show identification for their guests.

Guests who had come to visit single men and women living at one of the localities in Essel Towers, located on Gurgaon’s MG Road, received a rude shock on Friday evening, when guards of the complex allegedly denied them entry. The move led to a confrontation between the tenants and RWA members. In April, a similar notice was issued in another complex in Essel Towers.

The incident took place on Friday around 7 pm. The male guest of a 25-year-old resident of Pilot Court, who did not want to be named, was among those stopped at the entrance. “We went downstairs to speak to the guards when we found that several others who had come to visit their friends were not being allowed inside,” said the resident, who has been living in the locality for the last three years.

Tenants said they tried to resolve the matter by offering to show identification for their guests. “However, the RWA members became aggressive. Some of them started shoving us and one of the men accused us of encouraging prostitution… They threatened to complain to our landlords,” she added.

On Saturday, the RWA issued a notice: “Visitors other than immediate family members… are not allowed after 22.00 hours and before 08.00 hours (and not allowed to stay overnight).” It added that flats should be occupied by members of the same sex. The tenants responded: “We shall not provide proof of our relationship with our guests. Most of the tenants are fully grown adults with independent will.” RWA members could not be reached for a comment.

"I want peace at Indo-China border, will return the belt, says Vijender Singh","Vijender Singh beat Zulpilkar Maimaitiali at the ‘Battleground Asia’ in Mumbai. (Source: PTI) Vijender Singh beat Zulpilkar Maimaitiali at the ‘Battleground Asia’ in Mumbai. (Source: PTI)

Vijender Singh won his ninth bout in the professional boxing ring when he beat Zulpikar Maimaitiali of China in a unanimous decision at the NSCI Complex in Worli, Mumbai. The Indian boxer won an extremely close bout that was adjudged 96-93, 95-94 and 95-94 by the three judges that stretched his unbeaten streak to 9-0 even though Vijender would feel lucky to have come out with a win.

At the end of the bout, Vijender made a surprising request and announced that he wished to return his newly acquired belt so as to alleviate the tension across the Indo-China border. “I want to dedicate this win to India-China friendship! There is some tension at the border, need peace. I don’t want the title, for peace and harmony at the border between India-China I will give it back to Maimaitial,” he said to the surprise of many.

With the win, Vijender now holds both the WBO Oriental Super Middleweight and the WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title, which he already held, but his decision to hand the title back is a rare request which would be up to the officials.

On the bout that went all the way with both men going hammer and tongs for the ten rounds, Vijender looked weaker as the match went on with Zulpikar drawing in with some meaty jabs. The impact started to be felt on Vijender’s face who was bleeding by the eighth round. The boxer from Bhiwani acknowledged that it was a tough bout and something he didn’t expect – even with some jabs by Zulpikar’s being considered unsporting. “You all saw it was a tough fight, but happy that we came out victorious. It was unfortunate that he hit a few low blows and that upset me a little. But I had to recover quickly,” he said.

Before taking the questions from the ring announcer Charu Sharma, Vijender went outside the ring to acknowledge the strong celebrity presence including Amitabh, Abhishek Bachchan and Baba Ramdev, who had been to his previous bout in Delhi too. “I want to thank the people for coming out and supporting me. The likes of Amitabh Bachchan Sir, the king, the legend; Randeep Hooda, Baba Ji [Baba Ramdev],” he stated before leaving the ring.

"Video: PIZZA in CHAI!!!! Yes, someone actually tried that","The video shows the person swirling the pizza slice in the tea and it will make you feel squeamish. (Source: Just Pakistani Things/ Facebook) The video shows the person swirling the pizza slice in the tea and it will make you feel squeamish. (Source: Just Pakistani Things/ Facebook)

Now, we’re huge fans of food experimentation. After all, that’s how things evolve and we can expect new foods to pamper our taste buds. But there are some things that just should NOT be allowed. If the world was divided on the matter of pineapple as an acceptable topping on pizza – and this even had world leaders and A-list chefs weighing in (from Michelin chef Gordon Ramsay to Iceland’s president wanting to ban it totally, there is no end to this dispute) – then this next combination will make you shudder to your deepest core.

In fact, this could even start a World War III – over pizza, no less! Okay, we’re exaggerating a tiny bit, but pizza lovers from around the globe be warned, because once seen, you can not unsee it.

Just stating that we’ve warned you first.

A video is doing rounds on social media that shows someone DUNKING a slice of pizza in a cup of CHAI! Yes, you read it right… It’s blasphemous! It’s sacrilege! Yet, it did happen. The video further shows the person swirling the slice in the tea and it will make you feel squeamish.

The video was shared on a popular Facebook page known as Just Pakistani Things, and even the page admins warned the video is not for the faint-hearted, and we completely agree.

Watch the video here

Pakistani users have been freaking out since they saw the video and have been abusing the person, who ever decided to insult beloved pizza.

But this not first time, Pakistan went too overboard to make pizza desi. Earlier one pizza company in Karachi decided to launch Nihari pizza and fans went into a meltdown. Just look at with, served with ‘dhaniya patta and nimboo!’

Seriously, what were they thinking!

Another sacrilegious incident happened when a Bangladeshi pizza company decided to top their crust with Biryani! Thankfully it was only an April’s Fool Day prank and people found their peace.

"No other government did as much for settlement, says Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu","Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Source: Reuters) Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Source: Reuters)

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his government had done more than all its predecessors to boost Jewish settlement. He spoke as he laid the foundation stone for a new neighbourhood in Beitar Illit, the Israeli-occupied West Bank’s biggest settlement with a population of 50,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews.

“No other government has done as much for settlement in the land of Israel as the government which I lead,” he said, referring to the biblical Holy Land which many believers see as belonging to the Jews by divine right.

Settlements in the occupied West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem are illegal under international law and are seen as one of the greatest obstacles to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

Netanyahu has said he still supports a two-state solution, but peace advocates say his actions show otherwise. His right-wing coalition government leans heavily on the support of settlement advocates.

Israel occupied the Palestinian territories in 1967 in a move never recognised by the international community. More than 600,000 Israelis now live in settlements alongside nearly three million Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.

In December, the United Nations Security Council declared all such settlements to be illegal after outgoing US president Barack Obama decided not to veto its resolution.

Since US President Donald Trump came to power, however, Washington has remained largely quiet as Israel has announced thousands of new settlement homes.

The new development in Beitar Illit will have more than 1,000 homes. A senior Palestinian official on Tuesday said the White House’s silence over settlement growth and its failure to support the two-state solution encouraged “apartheid” Israeli policies.

The criticism by the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Saeb Erekat, came after the Palestinians had previously been careful not to antagonise the new US leader since his inauguration in January.

The Jerusalem Post daily said it was the first time since the 2009 start of his current run in office that Netanyahu had taken part in a settlement stone-laying ceremony. “We are working energetically for settlement in every part of the land,” he said on Wednesday.

He also pledged to act speedily to construct new homes for the roughly 40 families evicted from the wildcat outpost of Amona in February after Israel’s supreme court ruled their homes had been built illegally on private Palestinian land.

The new developement, named Amichai, will be the first government-sanctioned Jewish settlement built in the Palestinian territories in some 25 years.

Construction in settlements in the West Bank increased by 70 percent in the 12 months to March, according to data from Israel’s central bureau of statistics. The numbers do not include Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.

Shah is out on bail and is due to appear on August 31 at Barkingside Magistrates’ Court in London.

“The NHS (National Health Service) has a dedicated number for any individuals who may have concerns or questions. They can be contacted on 0800 011 4253,” the Met Police said.

The offences are alleged to have occurred between June 2004 and July 2013 and relate to 54 victims.

The charges announced follow a long-running investigation into Shah, who has been bailed several times after first being arrested in 2013.

Trophies stolen from home of former US Open runner-up Roberta Vinci,"The 37th-ranked Vinci has won 10 singles titles and 25 doubles titles on the WTA Tour and also helped Italy to win four Fed Cup championships.

Former US Open runner-up Roberta Vinci says her tennis trophies have been stolen.

Vinci writes on Instagram, “Unfortunately, a few days ago a group of thieves entered my house in Taranto and stole valuable objects. … including some objects for which the economic value is not even comparable to their emotional value to me: the trophies that I won over my career.”

While Vinci did not specify if the silver platter she was awarded for her runner-up finish in the 2015 U.S. Open was among the pieces stolen, she posted a picture of herself holding the platter. Vinci lost to fellow Italian Flavia Pennetta in the final.

The 37th-ranked Vinci has won 10 singles titles and 25 doubles titles on the WTA Tour and also helped Italy to win four Fed Cup championships.

The 34-year-old Vinci adds that whoever took the trophies from her home in southern Italy, they can’t take away “the memories, the tears, the sweat, the effort, the dedication, the smiles and the sacrifices made to achieve these goals.”

Two dozen reported injured by blast at rebel Georgian arms depot,"The separatist province’s interior minister Aslan Kobakhia was quoted by Interfax as saying that no one had died in the blast, but that emergency workers were still trying to get to the epicentre. The separatist province’s interior minister Aslan Kobakhia was quoted by Interfax as saying that no one had died in the blast, but that emergency workers were still trying to get to the epicentre.

Several people were injured as an explosion tore through a munitions plant in the Moscow-backed breakaway Abkhazia region of Georgia, Russian news agencies reported. “According to preliminary information 27 people were admitted to hospital… including 19 Russians on holiday in Abkhazia,” the region’s health minister Tamaz Tsakhnakia told TASS news agency on Wednesday.

Tsakhnakia said the injuries mainly consisted of light shrapnel wounds and that several people may need to undergo operations.

The separatist province’s interior minister Aslan Kobakhia was quoted by Interfax as saying that no one had died in the blast, but that emergency workers were still trying to get to the epicentre.

The blast reportedly tore through a munitions store belonging to the separatist authorities on the shore of the Black Sea. Abkhazia is internationally recognised as part of the tiny ex-Soviet nation of Georgia, but has claimed independence since a conflict in the wake of the collapse of the USSR.

Russia recognised the subtropical region — along with another province South Ossetia — as separate countries after a brief 2008 war with Georgia. Moscow has thousands of troops stationed in the regions in what Georgia calls a military “occupation”, and supports the two provinces financially.

‘Dujana and Lelhari were part of Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind’,"Musa said that Dujana and Lelhari “faced difficulties” from Pakistan-based militant leadership after they joined his Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind. Musa said that Dujana and Lelhari “faced difficulties” from Pakistan-based militant leadership after they joined his Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.

Slain militants Abu Dujana and Arif Lelhari were part of Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, an al Qaeda affiliate announced a week ago, militant commander Zakir Musa has claimed. “Our two beloved friends Abu Dujana Bhai and Arif Bhai achieved martyrdom in Hakripora (village) of Pulwama. May Allah accept their martyrdom and help us to carry forward their mission,” Musa, who was named as the affiliate’s chief, said in a purported audio message.

“Shaheed Abu Dujana Bai and Shaheed Arif Bhai were two such associates, who decided to embrace the flag of truth when they first saw it.’’ He added that they had an important role to in the formation of Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind. “And after its formation, they had the distinction to become the first martyrs of this jihadi organization,’’ he said.

Musa said that Dujana and Lelhari “faced difficulties” from Pakistan-based militant leadership after they joined his Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind. “When Shaheed Abu Dujana recognised truth and joined our ranks, the so-called Pakistan-based masters of Jihad created lots of hurdles for him. Shaheed Aqib Bhai, who participated in many courageous actions, too had to face many difficulties,” he said.

“But both of them were men of freedom and they continued to fight till the end; whether it was against the infidels of India or against the hypocrites.’’ In the one-and-half-minute audio message, Musa called the militant leadership “hypocrites” and congratulated Dujana and Lelhari for coming out of their web and joining him.

Dujana and Lelhari were killed in a firefight with security forces on August 1. Dujana had taken over as Lashkar-e-Toiba’s Kashmir chief after the killing of Qasim. He was disarmed after he fell out with the Lashkar. He then joined hands with Musa, who had quit Hizbul Mujahideen after being reprimanded over for his statement warning Hurriyat leaders.

One prisoner died and five were injured in a clash involving some 50 inmates in Guatemala, state prison authorities said. Special forces of the Pavon Prison, located just outside the country’s capital, intervened to regain control of the institution that houses some 4,000 inmates, prison system spokesman Rudy Esquivel told journalists.

He said the cause of the clash was under investigation, adding that victims showed signs of blows and wounds “presumably” caused by knives.

The prison was the scene of a July 2016 riot that left more than a dozen dead, including an ex-soldier imprisoned for killing a Roman Catholic bishop almost two decades ago. The Guatemalan Penitentiary System administers 21 prisons nationwide with a maximum capacity of 6,809 prisoners — but 22,574 people are currently in custody, according to official data.

(Source: File Photo)

Among the fresh faces that Bollywood has been hosting for a while now, Disha Patani is a trendsetter to look out for. With a radiant smile and girl-next-door looks, the actress has not just charmed people with her acting prowess, but often with her sartorial taste as well -on-screen and off it. From bikini to casuals, there is really nothing Patani cannot pull off and this time, it is her latest cover shoot for Grazia that has caught the attention of the fashion hawkers in the industry.

She sizzles in a black, lacy top from Louis Vuitton, that she paired with leopard print bottoms from the same luxury fashion brand. Styled by Pasham Alwani and Chuan Looi, Patani kept her look minimal, yet refreshing. With make up by Kres Kuang, she kept it understated, with just a pop of tangerine eye shadow and nude lip colour. She styled her hair sleek and straight, mid-parted and falling on both sides of her ears.

Patani, whose Bollywood debut M.S. Dhoni – The Untold Story, earned her many praises, was earlier seen scorching the ramp at the recently held IIFA awards in New York. She looked lovely as ever in a dazzling yellow Swapnil Shinde thigh-high slit gown and looked just as ravishing in a shimmery silver dress from Falguni Shane Peacock while walking the ramp at the IIFA Stomp.

US ends search for missing sailor in South China Sea,"A member of Chinese Navy stands watch as the guided missile destroyer USS Stethem arrives at the Shanghai International Passenger Quay for a scheduled port visit in Shanghai, China. The U.S. Navy has ended a three-day search for a sailor who is believed to have gone overboard during operations aboard the USS Stethem in the South China Sea.

The U.S. Navy has ended a three-day search for a sailor who is believed to have gone overboard during operations aboard the USS Stethem in the South China Sea. (AP Photo/File)

US naval forces have suspended their search for an American sailor who went missing during a joint drill in the South China Sea with Japan. “After more than three days of continuous search efforts, the US Navy suspended operations to locate a Sailor assigned to guided-missile destroyer USS Stethem” yesterday, the US 7th Fleet said in a statement. The missing sailor was identified as Lieutenant Steven D Hopkins, a Texas native, according to the US 7th Fleet.

On Thursday, China said it helped the US search for the sailor, a rare cooperative gesture in the disputed waters. The US, Japan and China “spent 79 hours in a comprehensive search that covered roughly 25,900 square kilometres,” the US 7th Fleet said.

But they were “unable to locate” the sailor after an extensive search, Captain Jeffrey Bennett, commander of Destroyer Squadron 15, said in the statement.

The incident comes just weeks after seven American sailors were killed when their Navy destroyer collided with a Philippine-flagged cargo ship in a busy shipping channel off Japan’s coast.

Aged 19 to 37, the seamen were found by divers in flooded sleeping berths a day after the collision tore a huge gash in the side of the USS Fitzgerald.

Japanese and US naval forces have been holding drills in the contested South China Sea in the face of Beijing’s increasing assertiveness over its maritime claims in the region.

Beijing has pursued claims on nearly the entire territory of the South China Sea by building military facilities and conducting naval exercises – despite partial counter-claims from nations such as the Philippines and Vietnam.

China is also involved in a simmering territorial row with Tokyo over disputed islands in the East China Sea.

Vijender Singh eyes double title finish,"Vijender Singh and Zulpilkar Maimaitiali were involved in a weigh-in and face-off for ‘Battleground Asia’ bout in Mumbai. (Source: PTI) Vijender Singh and Zulpilkar Maimaitiali were involved in a weigh-in and face-off for ‘Battleground Asia’ bout in Mumbai. (Source: PTI)

When Vijender Singh or ‘Singh is King’ steps up into the ring on Saturday night to face China’s Zulipikar Maimaitiali, there will be multiple things in his mind at the NSCI in Worli, Mumbai. He would be looking to keep his 8-0 streak going, keep his WBO Asia Pacific super middleweight title around his neck and add Maimaitiali’s WBO Oriental super middleweight title to his profile.

After fighting his previous professional bouts in the UK followed by Delhi, this is the first time that ‘Viju’ and his promoters have moved to the financial capital of the country. Expect plenty of celebrity presence with Sachin Tendulkar the first to get the ticket as part of the promotional campaign for the bout.

Vijender had been practicing and getting ready for the bout in Manchester – as he does – with trainer Lee Beard. He wishes to tap into Maimaitiali’s alleged inexperience. The southpaw has competed in nine bouts and won eight of them (with the remaining one finishing in a draw).

There is little to separate the two boxers with both standing 6’0″ tall (183 cm). Vijender is 31 while Maimaitiali is much younger at 23 and has a southpaw stance in comparison to the Indian boxer’s orthodox style of gearing up.

At the weigh-in on Friday, Vijender said he has to get himself leaner with the bout approaching. “This is India versus China, I don’t need anything and I am excited, I know the whole of India is with me. I am very confident and hope that the fight will be good and India will win. last night I checked my weight it was 78 and I had to be 76.2, so I did not eat anything. My weight is 76.00 today, I will very much focus on diet,” he said. He added that even though he discussed strategy with his coaches, the former Olympian would change his game according to how the Chinese boxer behaves in the ring. “My strategy will depend on how he plays, I will set my game according to him. We have changed a lot in technique and we have worked on it,” he said. “I am experienced. I don’t consider him as an experienced boxer, he is young, but he is a strong kid and we are ready for it. I have a game plan which I discussed with my coach, he (the coach) said stay calm, don’t be in hurry,” he added.

President Donald Trump says states can count on federal cash in emergencies,"President Donald Trump. President Donald Trump.

Gearing up for the heart of hurricane season, President Donald Trump said that states can count on his administration to dispense US emergency funds efficiently. “We do it quickly. We do it effectively,” Trump said at the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Friday, where he and members of his Cabinet received a briefing on the summer’s hurricane season, which began June 1. “We are very strong with respect to FEMA. FEMA is something I’ve been very much involved in already.”

Trump cited the administration’s response to a bridge collapse near downtown Atlanta that forced the closure of a portion of Interstate 85. The president spoke a few hours before embarking on his own summer vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

During his stop at FEMA headquarters, Trump got a tour of the command center, the hub where the agency coordinates its response during emergencies. Video maps line the walls to help officials monitor storms, weather conditions and more.

Federal officials predicted in May that the US could face 11 to 17 named storms, including five to nine hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast predicted two to four “major” hurricanes with sustained winds of at least 111 mph.

Forecasters expect warmer-than-average waters across the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea this summer. Tropical Storm Emily drenched parts of Florida earlier this week with rain, but no hurricanes have formed so far.

Trump was at FEMA headquarters accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.

Also attending was White House chief of staff John Kelly, formerly Trump’s secretary of homeland security.

"Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Sunny Leone, Sayani Gupta: Fashion hits and misses of the week (July 30 – Aug 5)","Hit: Recently, Kriti Sanon was seen giving us ethnic wear goals in a bright pink number from Anita Dongre. She worked the ethnic glam beautifully with big jhumkas and rings from Minerali Store. Equally good was her make-up and hair and we think celebrity make-up artist Adrian Jacobs and celebrity hairstylist Aasif Ahmed deserve a big round of applause. We love the soft smokey eyes, the nude pink pout and the twisted hair detail on the actor. Sanon just proves that pink and gold combination is a classic and if you are wearing a bright shade, you can keep your make-up understated. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

Hit: Sunny Leone turned into a sultry goddess in a beaded gown by Pria Kataria Puri. The nude-palette gown really complemented her curves and the Mastizade actor styled it well with a lovely diamond neckpiece and a statement ring. But what we like the most is that she decided to keep it elegant, with muted make-up, with just a hint of peach shimmer on her eyes and dramatic waves, styled on one side. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

Hit: Kangana Ranaut gave us a memorable look in a military green sari from Fabindia. We love how she channelised old world charm like a pro and it just reminded us of Indira Gandhi’s fashion sensibilities. The beautiful cotton sari with a dark olive green and dull gold border, which she paired with a collarbone-grazing neckline and three-quarter sleeves, is a classic which can be worn by women across all age groups. Her choice of footwear is kind of unusual and something we would have never expected but she carried the black brogues well with the Indian look. We also like her messy hairdo with a simple low ponytail, minimal make-up and her soft pink pout. Edgy and modern at the same time. (Source: Instagram/kanganaranautfanclub)

Hit: Dressed in the spectacular red dress with a plunging neckline designed by Ulyana Sergeenko, Priyanka Chopra looked stunning like she always does. Tying her hair in a neat ponytail, she looked sassy with a red lip shade and added zing with minimal accessories and a natural skin tone. The actress wore pearl white heels to complement the dress. (Source: Instagram/bolly__queens)

Hit: At the trailer launch of her upcoming film Shubh Mangal Saavdhan, Bhumi Pednekar looked pretty in a beautiful design from SVA by Sonam & Paras Modi. We are glad that celebrity stylist Aastha Sharma picked up this longline embroidered tunic featuring split sleeves and the A-line skirt with scallop trim detailing at the hem. The styling was kept simple with earrings and a ring from Amrapali Jewels. (Source: Instagram/aasthasharma612)

Miss: Anushka Sharma was seen in a raw silk kurta with matching palazzo pants, both from the label Urvashi Kaur. As much as we like the outfit, we don’t like the patch of mustard on her bust glaring at us. The look would have been so much better without that pop of colour. You can make some modifications of your own if you like the A-line style. (Source: Instagram/alliaalrufai)

Hit: Athiya Shetty has been going all-out with her wonderful sartorial experiments for the promotion of her film Mubarakan. We love her in this beautiful midnight blue lace gown from designer duo, Falguni and Shane Peacock. The silhouette is extremely feminine with the sweetheart neckline and the beautiful fall, waist-down. We think it accentuates her petite frame beautifully. Now, we would have liked it if she would have gone for a romantic updo to let the dress shine in all its glory but who can refrain from admiring those beautiful curls. We think she did good here, with the gorgeous hairdo and understated make-up. (Source: Instagram/stylebyami)

Hit: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has been writing the rule book on fashion in Bollywood, and continues to set trends. The Sarabjit actress who stunned us at Cannes, looked ethereal in a black off-shoulder ruffled Nedret Taciroglu number at Vogue Beauty Awards in Mumbai. We love everything about this look, starting from her gorgeous waves to her bright red pout. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Miss: Aditi Rao Hydari is usually in our best dressed list, but she seems to have had an off night this time around. Though we like that she chose an unusual printed Basil Soda gown, the overall look was a bit washed out. Styled by Sanam Ratansi, the nude make-up and retro hairdo just didn't work with the pastel blue shade of the gown. A more bold make-up and dramatically flowing hair would have made a huge difference. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Hit: Sayani Gupta gave us a stellar look in an Avaro Figlio outfit. The white top ticked all the right boxes with the cold-shoulder details and gorgeous ruffled sleeves. We also like the touch of the billowy black skirt with a sharp slit. We think it's a really cool outfit and she carried it well. Celebrity stylist Shreeja Rajgopal did an excellent job here. But what we like more is how she styled it with the gorgeous, futuristic bouffant hairstyle. Most celebs would have gone for a romantic hairdo, but not Gupta. Trust her to try out new things on the red carpet and get away with it like a pro. The smokey eyes and nude pout added to the magic. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Hit: Dia Mirza looked elegant in this white shimmery Rohit Gandhi and and Rahul Khanna creation. Styled by Theia Tekchandaney, we love how the look was understated and yet surreal. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Hit: Disha Patani might still be a newcomer in Bollywood but she has already made a mark owing to her immaculate fashion sense. And the actor sure did impress this time. Patani looked like a vision in a black Nikhil Thampi outfit. Backless with a long slit, the dress was risque but she pulled it off like a dream. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Hit: Sunny Leone is bold and fearless and somehow, we get to see this side of her attitude in her fashion choices as well. The Mastizade actor attended an awards night wearing a strapless black from Dimple Shroff's label. We think she looked nothing short of a goddess. (Source: Varinder Chawla)"
Turkey reinforces military units on Syrian border,"In this photo taken on Friday, Sept. 2, 2016, A Turkish tank heads to the Syrian border, in Karkamis, Turkey. (AP) In this photo taken on Friday, Sept. 2, 2016, A Turkish tank heads to the Syrian border, in Karkamis, Turkey. (AP)

Turkish news agencies say the country has increased its military presence along its southern border against threats from Kurdish militants in war-torn northern Syria.

The official Anadolu news agency said today that Turkey dispatched artillery to Kilis province to reinforce units there. The six-vehicle convoy included tanks and howitzers to be positioned across Kurdish-controlled Syrian region of Afrin, according to the private Dogan news agency.

Turkey has been vehemently opposed to the presence of the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, in northern Syria. The country considers the YPG, a key US ally in fighting the Islamic State group in Syria, a terror group and an extension of Kurdish militants operating inside Turkey.

In late April, Turkey relocated military units to Sanliurfa province across from another YPG-controlled area.

"Players coming to China just for money won’t enjoy it, says Fabio Cannavaro","Fabio Cannavaro has warned the foreign stars of making a move to China only for money. Fabio Cannavaro has warned the foreign stars of making a move to China only for money.

The European transfer market is witnessing huge amounts of money being splurged for top stars and players. But giving it competition is the Chinese Super League which is also witnessing foreign stars making big money moves to China. However, former Italian star Fabio Cannavaro has warned that foreign stars who are thinking of a move to China to fill in their pockets will not be successful and need to think twice before making such a decision.

It may be recalled here that players like Carlos Tevez and Anthony Modeste have made big money moves to China but Tevez has flopped spectacularly however and looks sure to leave China at the end of the season. However, someone like Alexandre Pato did manage to rejuvenate his game.

“If the players come here with motivation, they can really enjoy it. But if the players come here just to get money, they won’t enjoy it. Football in China is not easy. You play in stadiums like this where if you are not fit if you don’t concentrate 100 percent, you cannot play.”

Cannavaro also went on to reject claims that Modeste had come to China only to fill in his pocket and said, “If you change countries, if you come to Asia to play, of course, the money is important because it is not just about glory,” said the former Italian captain.

“But I said to Tony (Modeste) about our project: we are a young club but we want to improve a lot in the next two to three years and our objective is to win the Asian Champions League.”

"At the SSC, old man Rangana Herath all at sea","Rangana Herath picked up four wickets but gave away 154 runs. (Source: AP) Rangana Herath picked up four wickets but gave away 154 runs. (Source: AP)

For the first time in the series, Rangana Herath lost his fabled composure. At his accomplice Dilruwan Perera, who bowled what seemed like the zillionth short ball of the day. He shouted furiously and gesticulated wildly at him, flapping his arms sideways as if quipping, “Do you know where the stumps are?” It was strange of Herath, usually unflustered and unperturbed. But this has been a strange series for him, wherein he had looked not only bland but also troubled, treated around like a muck-as-any spinner, with disdain and not with the respect his age and achievements command. The outpouring was a reflection of his torn mind, the helplessness to produce his best and the haplessness in being unable to inspire his fellow spinners.

His stats make for an appalling read. In three innings this series, he has whittled out only five wickets, each costing him a shade less than 70 runs and 110 deliveries. There is something anomalous about it. In the three previous series here he has averaged 22.63, 18.00 and 12.75, stamped his imprint in each of their wins and looking half his age, and plotted heists out of thin nothingness.

But against India, he has looked every bit his age, a man knocking on the doors of his 40s, in a perpetual struggle to rekindle his wonted tricks. It was not the weariness of age, but the concrete plans the Indian batsmen had chalked out to neutralise him that has made him look out of depth. For they knew that if they could subdue him, half the battle will be won.

The consensus the Indian batsmen had reached was not rocket science. But to use their feet more often against him, and more importantly, do so early in the innings, before he settled into his rhythm, before his mind started conjuring entrapments. A classic instance was Shikhar Dhawan shimmying down the track in only the second over of this Test and clouting him over the long-on fence. This was after he was squarely beaten by a couple of deliveries. Now Herath was forced to shorten the length. And Dhawan could just lean back and cut him or clip him through the leg-side.

Thus each time Herath began a new spell or slipped in a few quiet overs, Indians would instinctively step out to him. Like on Thursday, soon after he had nailed Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane creamed Herath through mid-wicket so that the pressure was back on him. “When I went in to bat with Pujara, we decided to change our momentum because Virat got out and we wanted to put pressure back on them and that’s what we did,” he said. He was soon replaced with Nuwan Pradeep.

It was a template his teammates adhered to. “The idea was to attack him more often on the front foot so that you could score more runs on the back foot. Especially on this kind of wicket, it is very slow and dry, so we knew that if we use our footwork we will get more runs on the back foot,” Rahane explained candidly.

The strategy was devised after Herath slit through them in Galle in 2015. It has been a highly successful ploy too, as since that match where he took 7 wickets for 48 runs, he has added only 13 scalps at 53.61 against India.

That said, it’s not like just coming down the track and trying to thread the boundaries. For Herath is masterful at altering his flight, length and pace. But what Indian batsmen have strategically done is that they’ve almost always covered the line of the delivery when stepping out. They don’t look to fetch him over cover, but rather play him down the ground or whip him through the leg-side with the knowledge that he doesn’t rely too much on side spin.

Pujara did this habitually in Galle. Almost every delivery, he shed the crease and came forward. Not necessarily did he attempt a big shot each time, but he defended so resolutely that it upset Herath. Even if the latter pulled up the length or bowled wider, Pujara’s reach and whippy wrists would ensure that he was always to the pitch of the ball.

Thus, Herath began to err on the shorter side, because he knew his trusted method – that’s to draw batsman forward and ping them with the slider – was not working. He had to conceptualise an alternative. He did so by bowling a little short and slipping the slower, flighted ball. But the Indian batsmen, especially Pujara, were so quick with their footwork and their mind, it hardly harassed them. As a result, Herath was not only unable to prise out wickets but also strangle them.

Another stroke that disrupted him was the sweep, which both Dhawan and Rahane unfurled regularly. If the strip is not dual-bounced, there is no better stroke than a hefty sweep to unnerve a spinner, as it gives the batsman a wider arc, the bowler gradually loses his flight and length, and the captain begins to change his field desperately. Even Pujara, a reluctant sweeper, played it against Herath on Thursday to force Dinesh Chandimal to remove the short-leg fielder. Rahane abstained from the sweep on the second day, as the bounce had become uneven.

By subduing Herath, India have killed the contest and rendered it wholesomely one-sided. Unless he can conjure up some novel tricks, the series will trickle down to one of the most lopsided ones in the history of these two teams. Herath, is no stranger to comebacks. But at 40, against an emboldened Indian batting line-up, it would be a mighty difficult task. If he can, it makes for an engrossing narrative.

Vietnam regrets Germany’s accusation it kidnapped exile,"The undated image provided on Aug. 2, 2017 shows Trinh Xuan Thanh sitting on a park bench in Berlin, Germany. (Photo via AP, File) The undated image provided on Aug. 2, 2017 shows Trinh Xuan Thanh sitting on a park bench in Berlin, Germany. (Photo via AP, File)

Vietnam has said that it regretted comments by the German Foreign Ministry accusing Vietnamese intelligence services of kidnapping a former Vietnamese oil executive who’s wanted back home on embezzlement charges. German authorities believe Trinh Xuan Thanh was snatched in Berlin and gave the Vietnamese intelligence attache 48 hours on Wednesday to leave the country.

Thanh faces embezzlement charges, which carry the death penalty. He had sought asylum in Germany but his application had not been processed yet while Vietnamese authorities sought his extradition.

Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told reporters yesterday that the comments were “very regrettable” and that Thanh turned himself in to police in Vietnam on July 31. “Vietnam always attaches importance to and wishes to develop strategic relations with Germany,” she said, without elaborating.

Thanh, 51, disappeared in July last year after he was initially accused of mismanagement at a subsidiary of national oil and gas giant PetroVietnam, resulting in losses of some $150 million. Vietnamese police issued an arrest warrant in September. In March, police opened an investigation into embezzlement over his alleged involvement in a property development project.

Thanh was chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013, when he was appointed to several senior government positions, including vice chairman of Hau Giang province in the southern Mekong Delta.

He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was dismissed from the Communist-dominated legislature before its first session the following month. He was also stripped of his Communist Party membership.

Vietnam’s ambassador to Germany was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday and was told that Germany demanded that Thanh be returned so that the asylum and extradition proceedings could be conducted properly.

"In this Madhya Pradesh school, students are forced to study in toilet","Students returning from school. (Representational image) Students returning from school. (Representational image)

In a primary school in Madhya Pradesh’s Neemuch district, the students are being forced to study in a disused toilet as there’s no school building, reports said. Set up in 2012, the school, which is being run by a single teacher only, is situated nearly 35 km away from the Neemuch district headquarters.

Till 2013, the school functioned out of a rented room, but after that, it wasn’t available. School teacher Kailash Chandra claimed that he has been forced to take classes in the toilet because there is no school building.

It was also revealed that at times, when it rains, the same toilet was being used to give shelter to goats as well. Education Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Vijay Shah on Thursday said that there are almost 1.25 lakh schools in the state and because of limited resources it is becoming impossible to construct other school buildings, adding rented places are being allotted to carry on with the classes.

“In the case that has come up, no building has been constructed as yet. We have talked to the collector and the department. We have almost 1.25 lakh schools and in limited resources it is not possible to build schools. But we are making sure that there is no problem in finding a rented space” Shah said.

He added that though heavy rains took its toll on the school, the classes shouldn’t have been taken in the toilet.

“For that we have even called for an investigation report. We are asking of a report of wherever the problems of building prevail. Till the building is not made, they can go to a rented building and the State Government will bear the expenses,” he said.

Shah further said that wherever there’s no building, the government makes an arrangement, but then, the teacher should have given holidays if the situation was so bad.

"A month after portal is launched, complaints to PMPML double","The figures also revealed that 97.51 per cent grievances were resolved within the promised timeframe. The figures also revealed that 97.51 per cent grievances were resolved within the promised timeframe.

Complaints to the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) have almost doubled since the launch of its online grievance redressal system in July. Earlier, when the transport body received complaints only via telephone calls, SMSes or letters, the number of complaints received would be about 30 to 40 per day. Since July 1, with the addition of its eConnect app, the average number of complaints received has shot up to about 90 to 100 per day. Chairman and Managing Director Tukaram Mundhe said the digitisation of the grievance redressal system has had several positive outcomes, including more accountability and time-bound resolution.

Data provided by the PMPML revealed that out of every three complaints received by the transport body, one was against its conductor and driver either not behaving appropriately, or not abiding by the rules and guidelines. Of the total 3,316 complaints the grievance cell has received between July 1 and August 5 (afternoon), 985 were against the behavior and conduct of its staffers, including rude behaviour (198), plying late (280), skipping bus stops (203), rash driving (53), violation of traffic rules (50), talking on the mobile phone while driving (32), issuing wrong ticket (16), beating up passengers (9), pocketing the change (12).

Following this, other most frequently-received grievances were about the state of the buses (226), seating arrangements (40) and paraphernalia. The figures also revealed that 97.51 per cent grievances were resolved within the promised timeframe, which varies, according to the kind of complaints, between three and seven days. “The system is such that a complaint is automatically escalated if the department or official concerned does not respond in time. Besides, the official concerned is also issued a showcause notice automatically for not redressing it in time. Also, the passenger is given an opportunity to convey us their satisfaction or disatisfaction with the resolution. In case he or she is not satisfied, the case will be reopened and will be reinvestigated by a higher officer,” said Mundhe.

The issue of PMPML drivers and conductors misbehaving with passengers had come to the forefront on Thursday after a senior citizen was allegedly beaten up by a driver. The video of the man being beaten up went viral, resulted in protests. The administration had suspended both the driver and conductor pending inquiry. “Misbehaviour towards passengers will not be tolerated. Even if a passenger is at fault, it doesn’t mean that the staffer should lose their cool and behave improperly. They are the faces of PMPML and such behaviour maligns the image of the transport body,” he added.

He also promised that the identity and contact numbers of the passengers who register a grievance would be kept confidential.

“Instances where complainants allegedly received calls from the staffers, pressurising them to withdraw the complaints, are shocking and we have taken steps to ensure that it doesn’t happen again. In one instance, where specific information was received, the staffer and depot managers concerned are facing inquiry,” said Mundhe, asking passengers to use the system without any reservations and help the administration improve the transport body.

"PM Benjamin Netanyahu suspected of breach of trust, bribes: Israeli police","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Source: AP) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Source: AP)

An Israeli police document says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is suspected of crimes involving breach of trust and bribes in two corruption cases. The document released to media outlets Thursday night says the cases involving Netanyahu deal with suspicion of “bribes” and “breach of trust.” Police put a gag order on reporting any additional details.

Police have been questioning Netanyahu for months over corruption allegations for allegedly receiving gifts from high-powered Hollywood and business figures and separately over secret talks with the publisher of Yediot Ahronot, a major Israeli newspaper, for positive coverage in exchange for diminishing the impact of a free pro-Netanyahu daily in 2014.

Netanyahu denies wrongdoing, portraying the accusations as a witch hunt against him and his family by a hostile media opposed to his political views.

"This winter, flight operations at Chandigarh may be hit","According to the NOTAM, the airfield lighting system would not be available during the runway work. (Express) According to the NOTAM, the airfield lighting system would not be available during the runway work. (Express)

THE FLIGHT operations at Chandigarh International Airport in the coming winter is going to be affected badly as no runway lights would be available once work on upgrading the runway begins from October 3.

The information has been shared by the Indian Air Force (IAF) which is managing the Chandigarh International Airport and has now released notice to airmen (NOTAM) for the airport.

On Friday, the Punjab and Haryana Court was informed that the Air Force has already developed a tentative schedule for the running of the airport during the work on carpeting of the runway.

According to NOTAM, from October 3 to October 31, the watch hours will remain from 5 am to 3 pm, while from November 1, the watch hours would be between 5 am and 4 pm. From October 3, there will be no flight operations on Sunday. According to the NOTAM, the airfield lighting system would not be available during the runway work.

Now, airport officials believe that due to unavailability of the lighting system, the existing 1,200 metres runway visibility for landing will go up to 2,800 metres. “During winters, it would be difficult for the planes to land in dense fog. We are expecting flight operations to be hit badly in the upcoming winters,” said an official from an airline.

Officials from Chandigarh International Airport Ltd (CHIAL) said currently more than 35 flights are operating from the airport. “With the new watch hours timings, the flight operations is going to hit badly. But, at the same time, the runway upgrade work is very important for the future of the airport,” said an official. Those airlines which operate several flights after 3 pm is Jet Airways, Indigo and Spice Jet.

“The teams of all airlines will sit and everyone will prepare a new schedule. Either the flights would be rescheduled or they would be cancelled,” said an airline official. He said there was no confirmation whether the International flights operating from the airport would continue or they would be halted as it had to see whether the airlines would get a new slots at Dubai and Sharjah airports.

There are two International flights operating from the Chandigarh airport. The Dubai flight is operated by Indigo airline, while as Sharjah flight is operated by Air India.

An official from the Air India told Chandigarh Newsline it the limited watch hours has also casted a shadow over the Chandigarh-Bangkok fli”ht. “We cannot say anything when it will be started now because there are limited watch hours at the airport due to the runway upgrada”ion,” said an air india official.

The US has congratulated Pakistan’s newly-elected Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, saying it “looks forward” to working with him on areas of mutual cooperation. “We want to congratulate Prime Minister Shahid Abbasi on his election by the National Assembly. We will certainly look forward to working with him on areas of mutual cooperation,” State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert told reporters at her biweekly news conference yesterday.

“We have a very strong people-to-people ties with the government of Pakistan. We’ll look forward to working with Pakistan, and we’ll look forward to working with him as well,” she said in response to a question on the election of Pakistan’s new prime minister.

Meanwhile, Nauert said she is not aware of the claims by Former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that the then US President Bill Clinton had offered him $5 billion during Kargil war. “I’m not aware of any of that money and what you’re referring to from quite a few administrations ago,” she said.

Abbasi is likely to continue as premier for the remaining 10-month tenure of PML-N as the party chief Nawaz Sharif has hinted retaining his younger brother and Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif in the key province.

Sharif, who was disqualified by the Supreme Court in the Panama Papers case on July 28, had nominated Shahbaz to succeed him after winning a by-election on his vacant seat in Lahore. Abbasi, 58, was endorsed by Sharif to hold the post for interim arrangement of 45 days (till mid-September) till Shahbaz makes to Islamabad.

Japan’s Shinzo Abe, beset by scandals and a recent crushing loss in Tokyo elections, is likely to opt for safe hands over new faces in a cabinet reshuffle on Thursday that may not deliver the prime minister as much of a boost as he hopes. Opinion polls show support for Abe has plunged to its lowest since he returned to office in December 2012 with a promise to revive Japan’s stale economy and bolster its defences, endangering his goal of revising the pacifist constitution.

Abe had until recently also been seen as likely to win a third term as head of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and thus the premiership, putting him on track to be Japan’s longest-serving prime minister.

But support has fallen below 30 percent in the polls, hit by opposition-fanned suspicions of Abe’s favouritism to a friend, as well as voter perceptions that he and his aides have grown arrogant in office. The LDP’s defeat by a novice political party in a July assembly election has also hurt him.

“The goal of this cabinet reshuffle is to intensify ‘Abenomics’ and aim mainly for economic reform,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference on Wednesday, referring to Abe’s signature plans to reboot the economy.

But with media reports suggesting Abe will play safe and pick ministers with previous experience, some even in the same post, doubts are growing over the size of any ratings boost.

“I don’t think there’s any rabbits that Abe can pull out of his hat in the cabinet reshuffle that’s going to suddenly lead to a big bump in his poll numbers,” said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asia studies at Temple University’s Japan campus.

With a pick that may attract some foreign attention, Abe is set to tap Taro Kono, a former administrative-reform minister with wide international connections, as foreign minister, Japanese media said. His predecessor, Fumio Kishida, is set to become the LDP’s policy chief, the reports said.

Market participants had wondered whether Abe would seek to perk up his cabinet with a new faces, such as Shinjiro Koizumi, the telegenic son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, but the younger politicians did not appear in cabinet lineups reported by the media.

Itsunori Onodera is set to return as defence minister, a position he has held before under Abe, whose former trade minister Toshimitsu Motegi is to be economy minister, major Japanese media said.

Finance Minister Taro Aso is expected to remain, as is Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko, in a potential lineup that has not impressed financial markets.

“I don’t think the actual cabinet announcement will send markets suddenly lower, but I don’t think these will be popular enough to take his support rate up,” said Rikiya Takebe at Okasan Online Securities.

Seiko Noda, a former cabinet minister often spoken of as a possible future woman premier, will be minister for internal affairs and communications, media say, in a move to woo women voters. Noda tried to run against Abe in the most recent LDP election.

“She has been at odds with him in the past, so I guess it would be showing that he’s trying to be more inclusive and try to dampen his reputation of being haughty,” said Kingston, but added that he doubted her presence would help boost support.

Trump commends UNSC for adopting new sanctions on North Korea,"“Trump commends the UN Security Council for passing a new resolution that increases sanctions on North Korea in response to its recent ballistic missile tests,” the White House said. (File) “Trump commends the UN Security Council for passing a new resolution that increases sanctions on North Korea in response to its recent ballistic missile tests,” the White House said. (File)

US President Donald Trump has commended the UN Security Council for adopting new sanctions on North Korea, calling it the single largest economic sanctions package issued against the reclusive nation that is expected to cost Pyongyang USD 1 billion. Trump also praised Russia and North Korea’s ally China for voting in favour of the sanctions.

The UN Security Council unanimously adopted a US-drafted resolution that significantly strengthened sanctions on North Korea, with a ban on exports aimed at depriving Pyongyang of USD 1 billion in annual revenue. The US-drafted measure, negotiated with North Korea’s neighbour and ally China, is aimed at increasing economic pressure on Pyongyang to return to negotiations on its nuclear and missile programs.

“Trump commends the UN Security Council for passing a new resolution that increases sanctions on North Korea in response to its recent ballistic missile tests,” the White House said. Trump said China and Russia voted with the US to pass what he called “the single largest economic sanctions package ever” on North Korea.

“The President appreciates China’s and Russia’s cooperation in securing passage of this resolution,” it added. “He will continue working with allies and partners to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea to end its threatening and destabilising behaviour,” the White House said in a statement.

3 US Marines missing after aircraft crashes off Australia,"The aircraft was in Australia for a joint military training exercise held by the U.S. and Australia last month in Shoalwater Bay. (Representational Image) The aircraft was in Australia for a joint military training exercise held by the U.S. and Australia last month in Shoalwater Bay. (Representational Image)

Search and rescue operations were underway for three U.S. Marines who were missing after their Osprey aircraft crashed into the sea off the east coast of Australia on Saturday while trying to land.Twenty-three of 26 personnel aboard the aircraft have been rescued, the Marine base Camp Butler in Japan said in a statement.

The MV-22 Osprey had launched from the USS Bonhomme Richard and was conducting regularly scheduled operations when it crashed into the water, the statement said. The ship’s small boats and aircraft immediately responded in the search and rescue efforts.

The Osprey is a tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter, but flies like an airplane. They have been involved in a series of high-profile crashes in recent years.

The aircraft was in Australia for a joint military training exercise held by the U.S. and Australia last month in Shoalwater Bay. The Talisman Sabre exercise, a biennial event between the two nations, involved more than 30,000 troops and 200 aircraft.

Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said Saturday’s incident occurred off the coast of Shoalwater Bay in Queensland state.“I can confirm no Australian Defence Force personnel were on board the aircraft,” Payne said in a statement. “The United States are leading the search and recovery effort.”

Payne said she had spoken with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis “to offer Australia’s support in any way that can be of assistance.”A White House official said President Donald Trump had been briefed by chief of staff John Kelly on the mishap of an aircraft off the east coast of Australia.

In 2015, a U.S. Osprey crashed during a training exercise in Hawaii, killing two Marines. Last December, a U.S. military Osprey crash-landed off Japan’s southern island of Okinawa. Its five crew members were rescued safely. And in January, three U.S. soldiers were wounded in the “hard landing” of an Osprey in Yemen.

US Navy ends search for sailor thought lost in west Pacific,"The sailor from the guided-missile destroyer USS Stethem, based in Yokosuka, Japan, was reported missing and assumed overboard Aug. 1. (Representational) The sailor from the guided-missile destroyer USS Stethem, based in Yokosuka, Japan, was reported missing and assumed overboard Aug. 1. (Representational)

The U.S. Navy has ended a three-day search for a sailor who is believed to have gone overboard during operations in the South China Sea. A statement on Friday said that U.S., Japanese and Chinese navy vessels and aircraft spent 79 hours combing roughly 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers) of the South China Sea west of the Philippines, demonstrating what it called “the common bond shared by all mariners to render assistance at sea.”

The sailor from the guided-missile destroyer USS Stethem, based in Yokosuka, Japan, was reported missing and assumed overboard Aug. 1. His name is being withheld pending notification of next of kin, the Navy said.

Rear Adm. Charles Williams, the commander of Task Force 70, offered his prayers for the sailor’s loss and thanked all those who participated in the search, which included aircraft from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Ship JS Izumo, JS Sazanami and two People’s Liberation Army Navy frigates, in addition to U.S. assets.

China, which claims virtually all of the South China Sea, accused the U.S. in July of trespassing in its waters when the Stethem sailed within 12 nautical miles (32 kilometers) of Triton Island in the Paracel islands, which are also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan.

The operation was aimed at affirming the right to passage and challenging what the U.S. considers China’s excessive territorial claims in the area. China sent ships to intercept the destroyer.

China has strongly objected to repeated freedom of navigation missions by the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea, where Beijing has rattled neighbors by constructing seven made-man islands in the disputed waters and fortifying them with radars and missiles.

"FYJC: Shrinking vacancies, rising cut-offs make choosing seats for last round tougher","About 30,000 students are expected to fill forms for the 41,086 FYJC seats available for Round IV. About 30,000 students are expected to fill forms for the 41,086 FYJC seats available for Round IV.

The last round of FYJC admissions, which begins today, is going to be a crucial one as FYJC seats in most top colleges are either full or almost full, and the cut-off margins remain high. This is most probably going to be the last round of admissions where students can get betterment options, and may be the “last chance” for students to opt for another college or choice of subjects, say experts.

About 30,000 students are expected to fill forms for the 41,086 seats available for Round IV. A special round of admissions will be held after the ATKT results are declared. Experts have advised students to choose wisely, considering that cut-off margins have barely dropped in the last few rounds.

For example, at SP College, the cut-off in Round II for seats in the Science stream was 455, which dropped by only one mark to 454 in Round III. In the case of Modern College, the cut-off has actually increased by three marks, from 457 in Round II to 460 in Round III.

“This year, there was an option to change the preference list after each round. That’s why students who earlier didn’t choose top colleges or put it somewhere low on their preference list, thinking that they won’t get admissions, had an option to revise it after each round. That’s how the cut-offs didn’t fall, and sometimes even increased in further rounds. For Round IV, the competition will be tough, so students must not expect the cut-offs to drop much. In fact… in many faculties, the seats are now full,” said R R Pardeshi, principal of Fergusson College.

During the earlier rounds, thousands of students had not confirmed their seats as they were hoping to get better ones. But experts have warned students against taking any chances in Round IV, as chances of getting a college and subject of their choice would be difficult, as there are few vacancies in top colleges.

At least 25-30 top colleges have already declared zero vacancies. “… Most students are vying for a seat in the top colleges and they keep delaying their admission… the seats get full by the third round and for the fourth round, barely any seats will remain. If a college has only three available seats, will it make sense for a student with more than a 10-mark difference in cut-offs to apply there? That’s why students must look at the vacancies available in the colleges, compare the drop in cut-offs in the last three rounds and then select the college accordingly. Under no circumstance would I advice a student to choose a college where the difference between the cut-off and obtained marks is more than 10,” said Jagdish Chinchole, senior member of the Common Admission Process (CAP) committee and former vice-principal of Modern College.

CAP officials have also urged students to treat this round as their “last chance” at admissions. “Until now, we saw that students were still putting the names of colleges whose cut-offs didn’t match with their obtained marks… but they have to accept that the fourth round may be their last chance and now they should treat the preference list as the final one… In last few rounds, we have seen that the cut-offs have not fallen very sharply… in some top colleges, they have remained the same or even increased, so students should not choose a college with a large margin of difference…,” said Meenakshi Raut, assistant director of education, Pune.

She added that students should also consider the vacancies in constitutionally reserved categories. In many colleges, a large number of seats are vacant in SC/ST and other reserved categories, but no applications have been received from students for these categories. “In such cases, the process of inward reservation will be followed and the seats will eventually come to the general open category. Students should consider those seats while applying but even then, the scope for a difference in the cut-off wouldn’t be too much,” added Raut.

Real Madrid dominate nominations for Champions League awards,"Cristiano Ronaldo was the tournament’s top scorer last season. (Source: AP) Cristiano Ronaldo was the tournament’s top scorer last season. (Source: AP)

Six Real Madrid players have made UEFA’s shortlist for the best footballers in each positional category who played in the Champions League last season, the sport’s European governing body said on Friday.

Spanish champions Real, who won Europe’s elite club competition for the second year in a row, were awarded half the total slots on the shortlist.

Cristiano Ronaldo, who was the tournament’s top scorer last season, was named among the three best forwards of the 2016-17 campaign alongside his Barcelona rival Lionel Messi and Juventus’s Argentina international striker Paulo Dybala.

The best midfielder is sure to be from Real with their trio of Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric the only names shortlisted for the position.

Real full-back Marcelo and centre-back Sergio Ramos have been named in the best defender category alongside Juventus’s Leonardo Bonucci, who has since moved to AC Milan.

Goalkeeper is the only category where Real do not have a single contender, with Juventus stopper Gianluigi Buffon, Bayern Munich’s Manuel Neuer and Atletico Madrid’s Jan Oblak in contention.

The winners will be announced at the 2017/18 UEFA Champions League group stage draw on August 24 along with the Men’s and Women’s Player of the Year honours, the nominees for which will be announced on August 15.

The nominees were selected by a jury of 32 coaches from last year’s Champions League participants and 55 journalists chosen by the European Sports Media (ESM) group.

UEFA will announce the Europa League Player of the Season award on August 25 with all three nominees – striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and midfielders Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Paul Pogba – chosen from last year’s winning Manchester United team.

Sikkim standoff may derail business progress achieved in recent years,"In terms of the number of Chinese companies entering India for business, the trend is positive. In terms of the number of Chinese companies entering India for business, the trend is positive.

Chinese business interests in India have seen sharp vacillations over the last five years, with FDI inflows from China continuing to be tepid even as investment into sector such as telecom hardware witnessed an uptick, alongside the rising trend of Chinese banks ramping up their exposure to Indian companies, particularly in the e-commerce sector. The recent escalation in the tension between India and China on the Sikkim border, however, could potentially derail whatever little momentum that is visible in the inbound investment trend.

The investment exposure of Chinese companies in India over the last 17 years, which remains limited to a cumulative FDI inflow of $1.63 billion (Rs 10,094 crore) as on July 31, 2017, shows a notable rise in Chinese business interest over the last three years.

The cumulative investment amount over the last three years has risen from a low of $410 million (Rs 2,242 crore) in May 2014 to $1.63 billion in end-July 2017, taking China up from being the 28th largest investor three years back to the 17th largest investor at the end of July 2017. Foreign tourist arrivals from China to India shows that the country has moved to number nine position in 2016 from number 11 in 2015, as the number of Chinese tourist arrivals grew 21.8 per cent year on year to a total of 2,51,313 in 2016. This also accounted for 2.85 per cent of the total foreign tourist arrival in the country.

In terms of the number of Chinese companies entering India for business, the trend is positive. While recent numbers are not available, data with Registrar of Companies shows that as of December 31, 2016 there were 53 Chinese companies registered with RoC and 47 of them were active. According to analysis company Tracxn, Chinese companies have invested about $2.37 billion dollars in Indian companies from 2016 till now, much of which has come from companies such as Alibaba, CTrip and Tencent into Indian online start-ups that include MakeMyTrip, Flipkart and Paytm.

The list of Chinese companies that have entered Indian market includes electronics and handset manufacturing companies such as ViVo, Oppo, Lenovo, Huawei Technologies and TCL. Earlier this year, Indian footwear firm Woodland tied up with China’s Aokang International to sell its products at the Chinese company’s multi-brand outlets. Under the arrangement, Woodland will offer Aokang shoes at its outlets in India and its online platform while Aokang, which has over 4,000 stores in China, will stock Woodland shoes at over 100 outlets.

On the trade side, the bilateral engagement is overwhelmingly weighed in favour of China, with India’s trade deficit standing at $51 billion in 2016-17, a marginal decline from the previous fiscal. Bilateral trade with China stands at $71.48 billion. A report prepared by CII indicates that the biggest import items from China to India are electrical items and machinery and they amount to $21.9 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively. On the other hand, the biggest export items from India to China are ores, slag and ash ($1.6 billion) and cotton ($1.34 billion).

Indian companies across IT and pharmaceutical sectors have been looking to expand their presence in India but face several challenges. The CII report points that the pharma companies face challenges on account of time consuming and expensive approval process and also on account of complex post-registration steps including pricing and provincial tendering. On the other hand the IT companies seek resolution on issues such as uniform approval process for opening representative offices across provinces, regulations to strictly deal with IP violations, totalisation agreement (to avoid double taxation) and they also want provision to grant visas for up to six months with multiple entry.

But China’s expansion has continued. Indian power and telecom companies have been buying equipment’s from Chinese manufacturers. Reliance Power and Reliance Communication were one of the first companies to go for Chinese funding. While RCom took a Rs 8,700-crore ($1.93 billion at the time) loan from China Development Bank in 2011 towards refinancing of spectrum fee and equipment import from Chinese vendors, in 2012, Chinese state banks agreed to lend $1.18 billion to Reliance Communications to repay overseas convertible bonds due for redemption in March 2012.

In 2012, Reliance Power also secured $1.1 billion financing from three Chinese banks for the Sasan ultra mega power projects. Lanco Infratech, also entered into an agreement with CDB for $2 billion of debt in 2012, for two power projects totaling 2,640 MW. In 2014, Indigo had entered into an agreement with ICBC for a $2.6 billion funding to finance purchase of over 30 aircraft.

Arvind Yelery, associate fellow, Institute of Chinese Studies said that China has changed its approach and strategy towards India several times over the last 15 years since they opened up in 2001. “While the overall engagement with India has increased over the last two decades, the principles of economic engagement have not been consistent. China first looked at India purely as a market for trade and dumped their products and then they started to invest in India between 2008 and 2012-13. Now, there has been a shift and with growing international trade ambitions they are looking for India’s support for their OBOR project,” said Yelery.

He, however, said that the Doklam issue should not be a big concern for Indian businesses. “It is the Chinese who should be worried. While Chinese are looking for mega projects in India (railways, power etc), they should know that if they do not have a consistent policy with India, other countries such as Japan, Korea and European countries will benefit,” said Yelery.

He further added that India has levied anti-dumping duty on 167 Chinese products — the highest in the world. The US, the EU and Brazil come at 2nd, 3rd and 4th spot, respectively, when it comes to levying anti dumping duty on Chinese products. “Two countries among the top four are members of BRICS and it shows the lack of trust on China even in a small group,” he said.

At the ground level, Indian businesses however, continue to buy cost-competitive Chinese machines and products. The tension at India-China border notwithstanding, Huaxia Amusement Co, that is setting up a three-storeyed ride in Omaxe Connaught Place Mall in Greater Noida, sent two workers to install the structure in the mall just three weeks ago and they will be in India for a maximum of 42 days. However, there seems to be some slowdown in the trade related development since the calls for boycotting Chinese products gained momentum around Diwali last year.

The mall, which had leased out 2 lakh sq ft area to Chinese traders to set up ‘Dragon Mart’ with around 110 shops in the mall, has seen slow progress on that front. While Omaxe and the Chinese traders entered into an in-principle agreement for the leased area, almost two years ago, there has been no visible progress on the ground. Even as an Omaxe executive claimed that things are “on track” and the company has recently signed the final agreement with the traders, a mall coordinator said that he hasn’t seen any activity over the last six months in the area leased by Chinese businesses.

Usain Bolt digs in to advance to 100 metres semis,"World Athletics Championships: Usain Bolt of Jamaica celebrates winning the heat. (Source: REUTERS) World Athletics Championships: Usain Bolt of Jamaica celebrates winning the heat. (Source: REUTERS)

Usain Bolt took his first, somewhat stuttering, steps towards what he hopes will be a glorious World Championship farewell on Friday when he recovered from a poor start to win his heat in the first round of the 100 metres in 10.07 seconds. The Jamaican is seeking his fourth gold in the event – he has won the 100m at every world championships since 2009 apart from 2011 in Daegu when he was disqualified for a false start.

It wasn’t a false start on Friday, just a bad one, and Bolt said his blocks were to blame. “That was very bad,” he told reporters. “I stumbled a little bit coming out of my blocks. I’m not really a fan of these blocks. These are the worst blocks I have ever experienced. I have to get the start together as I can’t keep doing this.”

Asked what’s wrong with the blocks, he said: “It’s shaky. When I did my warm-up and pushed back, it fell back. It’s just not what I’m used to. It’s not as sturdy.” Bolt was given his usual rapturous welcome by the 55,000 crowd at the stadium where he completed the sprint double at the 2012 Olympics. “The crowd is always wonderful,” he said. “They always show me so much love and I always appreciate being here.”

The fans were less pleased with America’s world and Olympic champion Justin Gatlin, twice banned for doping offences and pipped by Bolt in the world championship final two years ago. He was loudly booed by many crowd when his name was announced and again when he won his heat in 10.05. American 21-year-old Christian Coleman, the fastest man in the world this year with 9.92, looked smooth in winning the first heat in 10.01.

On a cool but windless night, Jamaican Julian Forte was the only man to break 10 seconds, clocking 9.99 for his first time under the magic mark. The big surprise was South Africa’s Akani Simbine, who has been in hot form all season but finished fourth in his heat in 10.15 to scrape through as a fast loser. The semi-finals and final take place on Saturday evening. Bolt is also due to go in the 4x100m relay a week later – his final championship race before retirement.

"Mercy, My Jewels!","Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‘Mona Lisa of the North’, by Johannes Vermeer Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‘Mona Lisa of the North’, by Johannes Vermeer

Book- The Ring of Truth: Myths of Sex and Jewelry

Author- Wendy Doniger

Publication- Speaking Tiger

Pages- 397

Price- Rs 899

Wendy Doniger’s latest book, The Ring of Truth, has 45 pages of notes and a 30-page index. Yet, it is so much more than a well-annotated and minutely referenced compendium of stories about rings, lost and found, about how jewelry can establish the identity of a person or jog a buried memory of love. In Doniger’s agile mind and in her skilful hands, these become stories, as the very clever pun in the title suggests, about truth and reality, about how memory, recognition and human consciousness work for the self and for the other.

The stories in the book come from many genres, cultures and languages, but the paradigmatic story here is Kalidasa’s Shakuntala — a story about an innocent forest girl who loses the ring of recognition that the king, her ‘husband,’ gives her and then is denied physical as well as psychic recognition on account of its absence. When Dushyanta sees the ring many years later, he remembers his lost love and travels through the three worlds to find her and the son that she bore him. The child he encounters is proved to be his son through another piece of jewelry, a band that he wears on his arm. Eventually, all memories are restored, everyone is proved to be who they said they were and the family is reunited in love and happiness. A crucial character in this story is the fish who swallowed the ring that went missing – the fish, too, becomes a motif in the ocean of stories that Doniger draws upon.

Doniger takes the many strands of Kalidasa’s story and weaves them into other stories from around the world, indicating how they are alike or different from each other. But, unlike so many other gatherers of tales that resemble each other (Stith Thompson and Alan Dundes, for example), Doniger does not care about a mere taxonomy. Her interest lies not in what these stories tell us about themselves and each other, but what they tell us about ourselves — how we think, how we feel, how we construct reality, how we love those that we do and what it is, both within and without ourselves, that is lost when we lose our lovers and our memories.

Although she never leaves the world of classical mythology behind, as the sutradhar who holds the thread of rings and memory, Doniger takes us on a whirlwind tour of narratives from opera, works from 19th and 20th century literature, many contemporary works of fiction as well as to her other great love, the movies. In this volume, we get (re)acquainted with the Celtic fairy Morgana, Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Isolde, Siegfried and Brunhilde, various Shakespeare plays and a host of other lovers who are separated from each other, who cheat on each other in moments of ring-induced forgetfulness, who use rings and other personal objects to reveal their true identities or to unmask imposters.

There is also a fascinatingly detailed chapter about Marie Antoinette’s diamond necklace, a rather large, heavy and expensive piece of jewelry which, though entirely non-existent, took the allegedly extravagant and heartless queen to the guillotine. Reminding us that even in the real world, a piece of jewelry can be a potent symbol, a metonym, in fact, for a person, Doniger traces the story of this necklace-that-never-was through various historical sources. The factually verifiable version that Doniger produces of the queens and knaves, the kings and priests, the cuckolds and mistresses that animate the saga of the necklace would put Alexander Dumas to shame. Later in the book, a corollary to this chapter about the Queen’s Necklace is a thoroughly enjoyable, wise and witty takedown of De Beers, the company that markets diamonds as ‘symbols, myths, magic.’ (p.259)

Doniger tells us that The Ring of Truth actually split off from an earlier book for which she was collecting stories (The Woman who Pretended to be Who She Was, 2004). And, so it is that this book about rings of truth stays with many of Doniger’s favourite themes and recurrent concerns, such as sexual masquerade and substitution. Although she often refers to conventional Freudian readings of myth about real and imagined sexual encounters, Doniger is not afraid to call some of these encounters between men and beguiled (and most often, helpless) women ‘rape,’ for that is what they more correctly are. By analysing whatever devices of enchantment (curses, disguises, amnesia, darkness, fog) these stories use, she brings the essential nature of the pivotal sexual encounter to our attention. This persuades us to recognise how violence — emotional, physical and sexual — against women is prevalent in all cultures, hard-wired, as it is, into the stories that human beings love to tell over and over again.

Having said that, this is hardly the point of the book, which is anything but a feminist polemic against telling stories about women who lose their rings and are forgotten (or sometimes, ‘misremembered’) by their lovers. Rather, it is a book that revels precisely in these stories and the myriad ways in which we tell them. While the stories are often about sexual violence, they are even more about the cognitive violence inflicted upon the self and the other by forgetting or by the wilful erasure of memory. At a time when the danger of systematic cognitive violence against truth and memory is all too real, it is comforting to read a book which reminds you that memories can be restored, that truth can return, to heal both life and love.

TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay set to come out with book on his 136 days in jail,"Sudip Bandyopadhyay Sudip Bandyopadhyay

When Trinamool Congress MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Parliament recently, Modi told him “he looked well”. Bandyopadhyay, who was in jail for 136 days, replied, “Yes, you would know. You sent me to prison.” The Lok Sabha MP is now writing his prison diaries. The title would revolve around “the idea of banchana (deprivation)”, he says. Bandyopadhyay says he will describe living alongside someone accused of chopping his wife into 300 pieces as well as the “surreal experience” of queuing up for jail food. And, of course, underline the political vendetta behind his arrest.

The MP had been arrested on January 3 by the CBI in connection with the Rose Valley chit fund case, and lodged in Bhubaneswar Jail. On May 19. the Orissa High Court gave him bail. His fellow parliamentarian Tapas Pal, arrested in the same case, continues to be in prison. The TMC believes Bandyopadhyay’s book, slated to be released at the Kolkata Book Fair in January 2018, would be a “bestseller”. TMC chief Mamata Banerjee routinely releases her books at the fair.

Bandyopadhyay points out that he was not interrogated once during his incarceration — something the High Court observed while giving him bail. “They didn’t come and ask me anything about the case. It was a complete sham, nothing more than arm-twisting,” he says. “Every day in the morning, they would open the gates, and we could walk around the courtyard. That is all Tapas (Pal) and I did. But we both knew that no matter how much pressure was applied on us, that was something we needed to fight politically. This entire matter was ultimately a question of the BJP trying to threaten our existence because they couldn’t take us on electorally,” he says.

Recalling another anecdote that he says is part of the book, the MP says, “Narendra Modi once wanted to gift me a suit piece. He knows I like wearing suits and, in fact, we have always had cordial ties. But I rejected the gift. My conscience didn’t allow it, because we were opposing him politically over the rise in communal violence.”

Talking about his jail time, Bandyopadhay says his book will include the story of fellow prisoner Somnath Parida, a retired Army doctor accused of killing his wife Ushashree with a torchlight. “The doctor was convicted of murdering his wife and then chopping her body into 300 pieces. The pieces were then stuffed into 22 tiffin boxes which he kept in two iron chests,” he says.

After his release, the Lok Sabha MP says, he found he had lost about 15-20 kg. So his book will also talk of “jail cuisine”. “Every day, we were fed the same indistinguishable food. It has been days, but I am still not quite sure what it was that was given to us,” he laughs, talking about how he and Pal would queue up for food. “It was just like what you see in the films, we even had prison clothes on.”

The only person with whom he had any real interaction while inside was wife Nayna, Bandyopadhyay says. She had been given permission to see him. “I used to tell her that anyone who is in the Opposition and speaks out against Modi, can land up in jail. That is what the CBI has been reduced to. But I also knew that there is simply no point in trying to come to an ‘understanding’ with the BJP. That is what the Centre wants and they’ve done it with some others. I refused.”

A trusted Mamata lieutenant, Bandyopadhyay has been in the TMC since its inception and is among its seniormost leaders. After his arrest, there were attacks on the BJP office in Kolkata, while the TMC also held protests in Delhi and Odisha.

Bandyopadhyay says the book is his statement. “What the BJP doesn’t realise is that I have been in politics since Indira Gandhi was the PM. At the time, I was the Bengal Youth Congress leader. I have campaigned with her. Sending me to jail, for something I believe in, will not scare me. The book will have all these details, exactly how we were treated and how it was apparent that there was no reason apart from political gains for our arrest.”

Dinesh Chandimal calls for injury replacements,"Dinesh Chandimal is back for the Second Test against India. (Source: AP) Dinesh Chandimal is back for the Second Test against India. (Source: AP)

Sri Lankan skipper, Dinesh Chandimal has called for a new implementation of a rule where substitutes can take the field when injuries occur in the first hour of a Test match. Stating that there should be a rule where the replacement can bat and bowl Chandiaml said that it should be allowed when an injury occurs within the first 60 minutes of play.

In an interview with The Daily Observer, he said, “Asela got injured in the first session itself and we badly missed him throughout out the match, I am not saying this because our team would have been benefited but in future also all other teams, if meet this situation, would welcome it.”

Meanwhile, it may be recalled here that Chandimal was also given permission by the ICC to use an inhaler during the second Test, after recovering from a bout of pneumonia. “I am much better. Thanks to the ICC they gave permission for me to use the inhaler, and that will help me breathe properly,” Chandimal had said.

Earlier, before the second Test, Chandimal also stressed upon the fact that his side was ready for the second Test and was in a strong frame of mind. “We trained for three days all the players are in a good state of mind,” Chandimal said and then added, “I go into every match hoping to win. I have that determination and I have good players as well.”

I haven’t met R Ashwin but am a fan of his variations in Test cricket: Deepti Sharma,"Deepti Sharma was introduced to the game of cricket by her elder brother Sumit. (Source: File) Deepti Sharma was introduced to the game of cricket by her elder brother Sumit. (Source: File)

From the city of Taj to Lord’s, young nineteen-year-old Deepti Sharma is living a dream. At the age of nine, Deepti began a journey of which she was uncertain about where it would lead her. But with the destination firmly set in her mind, she kept following her dream of making it into the women’s cricket team with dogged determination. Youngest of seven siblings, Deepti was very close to her elder brother Sumit, who introduced her to the game of cricket. Speaking to Indianexpress.com, Deepti recalled the incident which was the changing moment in her life.

“I used to accompany my brother Sumit to his academy. One day I was sitting on the stairs watching his match and suddenly the ball came to me. I threw the ball and it directly hit the stumps. There were a few girls practising on the field and among them was Hemlata Kala (former Indian cricketer). She asked my brother if I was his younger brother. In reply, he corrected her and said that she is my sister,” Deepti recalls. “Without wasting much time, Hemlata ma’am asked Sumit to get me for training every day.”

Deepti credits Kala for her success so far. Naturally, a right-hander, Deepti believes if the former cricketer had not exposed her to the opportunities, she wouldn’t have made it into the women’s team at such a young age.

Fond of watching videos in her free time, Deepti is now focused on revamping her spin bowling. And to do so, she watches Ravichandran Ashwin’s videos and tries to learn from his variations. “I haven’t met him yet but am a fan of the variations he uses in Test cricket. I often try to bowl the carrom ball at the nets but haven’t used it in a match situation as yet. It is necessary to have variations in your bowling as most of the non-Asian players find it tough to handle spin.

Deepti believes she is more of a batting all-rounder and prefers batting higher up the order. However, she is comfortable in batting at any position wherever her captain wants her to.

“The win against England in the (World Cup) opener was a confidence booster for us. From there on we started believing in our abilities and complimented each other’s efforts. Also, we did not rely on one player and saw a different match winner in each game,” she said.

From being 191/3, Indian women’s team was bundled out to 219. Seven wickets in a matter of 28 runs saw India hand the World Cup title, which was pretty much in their hands, to England.

“When I went to bat in the final, the team needed 28 runs and my focus was on staying until the end. I focused on taking singles. It was an achievable target but somehow things did not work in our favour,” said Deepti when asked about what going on inside her mind during India’s

“Not many people recognised us before we went to the World Cup. But it is after our performance England that people started hailing us. One thing I have learnt is to remain cool in pressure situations. Whatever the situation is, you need to stay calm which unfortunately we couldn’t in the World Cup,” she added.

When asked about how is Mithali Raj as a captain during intense situations, the left-handed batswoman said her captain has qualities similar to that of MS Dhoni. “Mithu di is like the Dhoni of our team. She is cool and composed at crucial moments. She believes our performance should speak for us. I always try to learn good things from her,” said Deepti.

Wishing to see more talent step out after their performance at the World Cup, Deepti feels women’s IPL should start soon. “Women’s IPL should have started long back but its never too late. The sooner it starts it’s better for us,” she concluded.
