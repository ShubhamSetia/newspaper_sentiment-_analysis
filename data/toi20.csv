Ruthless England hand Windies a thrashing

Windies lost 19 wickets at Edgbaston on Saturday (August 19) in a horror display which allowed England to wrap up a three-day victory and take a 1-0 lead in the three-match rubber. It was about as poor a display of Test match batting as you could see from the tourists and their innings and 209-run defeat does not bode well for the competitiveness of the rest of the series.

A lack of basic discipline and patience, some might even say fight, resulted in a disproportionate number of poor shots from the Windies batsmen, eight of whom were dismissed twice in the day. On what was still a good pitch for batting, the visitors' capitulation, for that is what it was, within 93 overs across both innings should elicit plenty of stern words from coach Stuart Law. Despite their inexperience, this simply wasn't good enough.

It was England's third Test victory in a row, the first time since the summer of 2014 against India that they have won three successive matches. It will not, however, have told them much they didn't already know about their team and unless the Windies improve markedly in the next two Tests, England will have learned little ahead of the Ashes series.

James Anderson, who took four wickets in the day, was probably the pick of England's bowlers - it took the visitors 21 deliveries before they scored a run off him today - but Stuart Broad was equally impressive. When he dismissed Shane Dowrich in the final session, Broad overtook Sir Ian Botham to become England's second-highest Test wicket taker. At 31, there's plenty of time to add to his 384 victims.

Resuming on 44 for 1 this afternoon, the Windies lost the remaining nine wickets in their first innings for 124 runs to be bowled out for 168 just after the lunch interval. They were 346 runs behind England and with plenty of time left in the day, Joe Root enforced the follow-on perhaps more in hope than expectation of wrapping things up today. As it was, the visitors were bowled out for 137 second time round, losing six wickets for 61 runs after tea, and the win was sealed at 8.56 pm.

The day's rout had been started by Anderson, who dismissed Kyle Hope and Roston Chase without conceding a run and then ran out Keiran Powell by two yards from mid-off for good measure. The ball to dismiss Hope was a beauty, jumping from a good length to take the shoulder of the bat to Ben Stokes in the gully. The one to Chase was less spectacular but no-less effective as the batsman chopped a good length ball on to off-stump with an angled bat. Powell's attempted run was suicidal.

He was not the only batsman to be complicit in their own downfall. Shai Hope drove expansively and loosely at Roland-Jones and played on for 15 before Shane Dowrich swiped across a full delivery from the same bowler and was plumb LBW. Captain Jason Holder swished unconvincingly a number of times outside off-stump before finally edging Moeen Ali behind for 11. With his side in trouble, it was a poor show from the captain.

When all was going to pot around him, Jermaine Blackwood at least stood firm. He finished with 79 not out from just 76 balls and took full advantage of the width offered to him early on, in particular by Stokes. It was a fighting innings which included two sixes but the number six found little support. Broad bowled Kemar Roach and dismissed Alzzari Joseph LBW before Miguel Cummins was run out by Tom Westley as Blackwood tried to steal the strike. It rather summed up the tourists' innings.

It cannot have taken much time for Root to decide to enforce the follow-on given his bowlers had only got through 47 overs worth of work and the shambolic nature of the opposition's batting. Within five overs, Anderson had his 491st Test wicket when Powell played away from his body to a ball angled across him and edged to Alastair Cook at first slip.

Kyle Hope was next to go LBW to Roland-Jones and Shai Hope followed shortly after wafting at a rising delivery from Stokes and edging to Joe Root. They were two more poor shots to add to the list. Kraigg Brathwaite, the only front-line batsman not to be dismissed twice in the day, battled gamely for 40 before missing a turning ball from Moeen on the stroke of Tea which was given out LBW on review.

That left England with six wickets to get in the final session which they did in less than 20 overs. Blackwood was the first to go, stumped off Moeen, rather undoing his good work of the first innings, and Chase was LBW to Broad from a ball which kept low. Holder was dismissed next ball, caught at second slip, and although Roach kept out the hat-trick ball, England were not to be denied. The last three wickets fell soon enough, Broad finishing with 3 for 34, which put the Windes out of their misery and sent a raucous Edgbaston crowd home happy.

Brief scores: England 514/8 decl. (Alastair Cook 243, Joe Root 136; Roston Chase 4-113) beat Windies 168 (Jermaine Blackwood 79*; James Anderson 3-34) & 138 (f/o) (Kraigg Brathwaite 40; Stuart Broad 3-34) by an innings and 209 runs.

Four Sanitation Workers Die After Inhaling Toxic Gas While Cleaning A Tank In South Delhi,"Four sanitation workers died while cleaning a septic tank in Ghittorni area of South Delhi. The toxic gas that was emanating from the tank is the cause behind their death.

‚ÄúThe tank was originally meant for rain water harvesting and was filled with dirt and sewage. Anil, Balwinder, Deepu, Swarn Singh and Jaspal Singh entered the tank one after the other. While Anil, Balwinder, Swarn and Deepu were declared brought dead, Jaspal was sent home after treatment‚Äù, reports India Today.

The workers arrived at the tank to clean it on July 15. Anil entered the tank but stopped responding. Balwinder, worrying about his co-worker went inside the tank and soon stopped answering to other's calls within a few minutes.

After five men went in one after the other and stopped responding, the sixth man stepped towards the tank. The gas coming out from the tank made him unconscious.

Soon, police rushed towards the spot with two fire engines. The bodies were pulled out during the day.

A case has been registered against the owner of the tank, JK Mehta under under Sections 304 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

One Man Is A Serious Threat To Sachin Tendulkar's Record Of Most Runs In Tests And That Is Alastair Cook,"When Sachin Tendulkar hung up his boots, his final tally of Test runs was 15,921.

AFP

Four years on he still holds the records for the most runs in the format, but one man is closing in. That person is none other then England's opening mainstay Alastair Cook.

Cook is currently on 11,478 and needs 4444 to go past Sachin.

AFP

Certain factors are in his favour. The southpaw has the highest run-getter among active Test players. The man is in good form, and at 32 has a lot of time on his side. Not to mention the fact England play around 15 Tests a year which gives him all the more opportunity.

Cook only plays Test cricket as he is no longer part of the shorter versions for quite some time now. This means he has more time to focus on his game and in the next four to five years could easily go past the Master Blaster.

AFP

Of course there is still a long way to go. Variables like fitness issues, injury or dip in form may come into play. While time will determine if he breaks Sachin's record, he is, for the moment, certainly a threat.

"Mission possible: A new India: PM is using India‚Äôs high-quality, low-cost technology to lift 400 million out of poverty by 2022","On 15 February this year, Isro placed 104 satellites into orbit using only a single launch of one vehicle, PSLV-C37. The video of the event, available easily enough on the net, shows the familiar zoom of a rocket entering space, and then little flicks chase one another into the deep distance until the mission is completed. Only three satellites were Indian; 96 were commissioned by two American companies, Planet Laks and Spire Global.

The acceleration in space, impressive as it is, might be less spectacular than the change taking place on the ground. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has initiated a transformation towards a new India in which historic burdens such as poverty and corruption have been eliminated, and inheritance ills like communalism and casteism are only bad memory. His mission has a calendar; the deadline is 2022, when India celebrates its 75th year of independence.

Transformative change needs radical thinking. The economic empowerment of women is being used as a principal cure for poverty. Under Mudra, the PM‚Äôs signature project for those at the base of the economic pyramid, loans worth Rs 3,55,590 crore have been disbursed. Remarkably, 78% of those taking these loans are women.

The PM‚Äôs housing plan, for the impoverished, is an equally big story in gender emancipation. A woman can take this home loan as sole owner; but a man needs a woman as co-owner unless he is a widower or bachelor. This is a fundamental shift in the balance of power within a family. Over 25 million women who thought that a gas cylinder was a privilege of the middle class or rich, are now in smokeless kitchens. Swachh Bharat is a means to dignity and better health for women. The list is long.

The objective is to lift about 400 million out of harsh poverty in five years by ensuring that the first fruits and largest share of economic growth go to those who need it most. In a complementary initiative, the PM is using India‚Äôs proven capability in high-quality, low-cost technology to create efficient, sustainable and corruption-free delivery systems for direct benefits to the poor on an unprecedented scale.

Jan Dhan was an essential first step. In 2015, within three months, banks opened 300 million accounts for those who had never crossed the doors of a bank before. Critics sneered that these were ‚Äúcashless‚Äù. Unsurprisingly, they had missed the point: banks were now serving those without money, rather than those with.

Use of technology for transparency has also become mandatory in the bidding process for government contracts. In a country where, particularly during the long decade between 2004 and 2014, contracts became synonymous with corruption, the change is a virtual revolution, leaving sections of the old political-industrial complex frustrated, angry and desperate to restore the previous order.

New India is being fashioned from embers of the old. Sceptics who cannot fathom why Narendra Modi has become the most popular PM in memory need look no further than his comprehensive assault on poverty and corruption.

It surely cannot be anyone‚Äôs case that through some twirl of a magic wand, India should suddenly become free of all ills. Among our difficult legacies is the politics of Hindu-Muslim differences, a tragedy that has simmered and often bubbled into conflict. One long-standing dispute has been over the cow, held sacred in Hinduism. Mahatma Gandhi urged an end to cow slaughter; and the lead architect of our Constitution, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, included this as a guiding tenet of our Constitution. Beef was banned in most states by Congress governments.

Of late, cow vigilantes have attacked Muslims and Dalits on suspicion of eating or transporting beef. Two incidents attracted wide, and understandable, media coverage: of Pehlu Khan in Rajasthan and Junaid in Haryana.

No government can prevent crime. A government‚Äôs bona fides are tested by what it does in pursuit of the criminal. In Rajasthan, seven suspects have been charged with murder. The state‚Äôs chief minister Vasundhara Raje has dismissed as malicious the allegation that her administration was biased and argued the same in this newspaper, in an oped piece headlined ‚ÄòMob violence is unacceptable‚Äô (27 July). Comparisons are not an answer, but she pointed out that murders and mob violence took a higher tally in Rajasthan in 2012, when Congress was in power. In Haryana, five were arrested but the main suspect escaped. Police traced him to Sakri, in Maharashtra, where he thought he had found safety in obscurity. He has now confessed to stabbing Junaid.

On 29 June, PM Modi expressed his anguish during the centenary event of Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, wondering how much pain Gandhi himself would have felt. Gandhi had offered to die for the cow, but never advocated violence in its name. Finance minister Arun Jaitley has described the incidents as barbaric.

Both voters and politicians are increasingly dismissive of the motivated and fraying narrative of extended guilt. Nitish Kumar, for instance, refused to buy this false propaganda of Congress, whose only electoral crutch now is the alleged insecurity of minorities.

In 2013, there was an assassination attempt on Narendra Modi during a rally in Patna. At that critical, volatile moment, he said that Hindus and Muslims had a choice: they could either fight each other, or they could unite to fight the true enemy, poverty. Fraternity and prosperity of all Indians is the only creed of Narendra Modi."

"200 Gujarat Families Transport Human Waste, 'Swachh Bharat' Built Toilets But No Sewerage Lines","Champa Vaghela, who discontinued studies after class 12, and a neighbour carry waste from her house in Vejalpur to be dumped in the open.

As Swachch Bharat campaign picks up momentum and the Gujarat government tom-toms the record number of toilets it has built across the state, around 200 families in Vejalpur and Thaltej are literally forced to carry their own excreta and dispose it off daily. The reason: the government has built toilets for them but not provided sewerage lines to dispose it off.

According to the Swachch Bharat Mission website, 87.41 per cent of households in the state have been provided with toilets till now.

TOI/Representational Image

As Amdavadis line up plans to celebrate the New Year, 150 families in Vejalpur and another 75 in Thaltej have more pertinent problems to deal with. The families, mostly from Dalit and Valmiki communities who earn less than Rs 10,000 per month, are forced to shell out Rs 2,000 on resurfacing the cesspits. To ease their burden, they dispose it of themselves before the cesspit gets filled up. This has been their daily routine for the past one year. Numerous representations and repeated pleas to the civic body have failed to improve their condition.

While Vejalpur councillor Panna Rao claims there is no such problem in her area, Thaltej councillor says gutter connection has been provided. What residents say At 18, Champa Vaghela was forced to stop studying after clearing class 12. Her daily ritual now is to empty an open sink behind the toilet, fill up the waste in a container and throw it out. She belongs to a family of six who reside in Vejalpur.

""We have had a toilet for a year, but all the waste gets collected outside which we empty every day. The smell is so strong that our heads start reeling, but we have no solution. Nobody other than us will clean it,"" said Champa.

Kiritbhai Kabira has been living in Thaltej for the past 20 years. It was only last year that his family of seven was provided with a toilet under the government's scheme. Only half the cost was shared by the government, but there is no sewerage connection.

""We have been told by civic officials who visit us often that our houses will be demolished for redevelopment and so the sewage line has not been provided. But we cannot control our bowel till we get a connection.""

TOI/Representational Image

Kabira further shared his agony, ""The cesspit adds 2,000 rupees to our expenses when we open it to remove the waste and get it resurfaced. Other additional problems include absence of streetlights and no pucca road. Development just seems a long way away.""

Dashrathbhai is worried about the diseases that his family of six and others will have to face due to the unhygienic conditions created by the open dumping of the waste. Champa Purabia who stays with her grandchildren has a lake full of waste behind her oneroom house. The 55-year-old woman is unaware as to who built the toilet at her place, ""It may be an organisation or government. I was happy that after residing here for more than a decade, I would be free from queueing up outside the Sulabh Sauchalaya. However, that is not to be. Only my two grandchildren use the toilet, otherwise the cesspit will be filled up and we will have to spend money to get it resurfaced. I still stand in the Sulabh line since 5 am to relieve myself and after dark it is open defecation.""

Purshottam Vaghela, director of Manav Garima, an NGO that works for the benefit of manhole workers said, ""Laws have been made and rules have been framed that makes such work illegal, but it continues unabated. The government's toilet scheme is just a show off as the toilets have been without the basic gutter connection.""

What officials say Vejalpur councillor Panna Rao claims she is a regular visitor to the area, but has not found such a problem in the area.

""Nobody has ever brought this to my notice. But now I will personally check the situation.""

Thaltej councillor Laxmi Chaudhary too is unaware of such a situation in her ward. ""Cesspit is a long lost system. I have visited families doorto- door, but have not noticed such a problem. And as per government scheme, along with the toilet, gutter connection is also provided. I am amazed to know this.""

AP

Lalsinh Thakore, BJP whip and Thaltej councillor said, ""There is a procedure to follow before providing any facility to slum dwellers. Paying tax to AMC is nothing new, we need to check if their stay is legal or illegal or they are just temporary dwellers.""

When Mirror questioned that if the dwellers were staying illegally, then why they were provided the toilets under the government scheme, to which Thakore said, ""There is no logic behind providing toilets and no sewerage connection. The metro work is in full swing and the area will be redeveloped, so if sewerage connection is provided and if we pull down their slums, then the game of allegation will start.""

In the past one and half years, AMC has built 22,000 individual toilets, 24 pay-and-use toilets and 41 public toilets in the entire city.

Deputy Municipal Commissioner C R Kharsan claims that 90 per cent of toilets have sewerage connection.

Kharsan said, ""Such problem prevails only in four or five areas which account for over 1,000 toilets in the city that don't have a sewerage connection. Each area has a septic tank which directly sucks the waste so the question of cesspit does not arise.""

He added, ""One reason why these slums have not been provided the sewerage connection is because of development. Under the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), the slums will be redeveloped and they will be given a flat instead, so keeping this in mind sewerage connection might not have been provided.""

Narendra Modi‚Äôs black money claim from Red Fort at variance with Finance Ministry,"One of the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Independence Day speech was his solid defence of demonetisation coupled with claims of having unearthed huge amounts of black money from the system. But data available in the public domain suggests that Modi‚Äôs claims need to be taken with a pinch of salt. As per Modi, demonetisation has resulted in almost Rs two lakh crore of black money finding its way back to the banking system.

But this claim is at variance with multiple public statements issued by Finance minister Arun Jaitley and his junior minister Santosh Gangwar between December 2016 and August 1, 2017 which together show that government had no clear estimate of black money in this period. So, either the PM has received new information since or there is a contradiction in claims made by Finance Ministry and PMO.

Here is what Finance Ministry has been saying on black money estimates so far before Modi‚Äôs Red Fort speech:

1. August 1, 2017: Minister of State for Finance, Santosh Gangwar said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha that there was no official estimation of quantum of black money in India. The reply mentions that demonetisation was introduced with a view to curbing financing of terrorism through the proceeds of fake Indian currency notes.

2. July 21, 2017: In a written reply to Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley mentioned there is no official estimation of quantum of black money stashed by Indians in foreign countries or foreign banks. On unaccounted wealth, his statement mentions that the government has commissioned a study on estimation of unaccounted wealth and income which will be conducted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM).

3. April 7, 2017: Gangwar said in Lok Sabha that there is no official estimation of the amount of black money in form of old Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 that have not been deposited during the course of the demonetisation drive. This means that the government is not in a position to say if the money that has not come in after demonetisation is illegitimately earned or otherwise.

"‚ÄòWhen a woman uses law, she is accused of misuse; when an Indian woman uses law, she is labelled with bad character‚Äô","The Supreme Court‚Äôs recent direction stopping arrests or coercive action against accused husbands or their relatives charged in anti-dowry complaints under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code without ascertaining the veracity of the allegations marks a shift in Indian jurisprudence on women-related issues. Indira Jaising, former additional solicitor general and senior SC advocate, spoke to Sugandha Indulkar on why she thinks the order, which stipulates that all states must set up family welfare committees in each district to verify such complaints, will adversely affect anti-dowry cases:

How you define ‚Äòuse‚Äô and ‚Äòmisuse‚Äô of law with respect to the recent SC directives on anti-dowry provisions under Section 498A of IPC?

The word ‚Äòmisuse‚Äô is itself misused by the courts. Whenever a woman uses the law, she is told she is misusing it; shockingly, when an Indian woman accesses the law, she is often labelled as a woman of bad character. It is a classic case of victim blaming. Good women are bound by ‚Äòmaryada‚Äô and so they don‚Äôt go to the law. The court too looks at the woman who demands application of Section 498A as: here comes another one who is misusing the law.

In a patriarchal society, where women are often subjected to violence, Section 498A was a great respite. In the majority of Indian families, a newly-wed couple lives in a joint family, where the bahu is living with her in-laws. If such a woman is tortured, physically or mentally, within the first two years of marriage and is thrown out of her matrimonial house, she is left with no option but to resort to legal action against her persecutors ‚Äì including her parents-in-law ‚Äì who at times connive with their son.

Despite such ground realities, courts are saying women are misusing the law by adding parents to the FIR. This ruling dilutes the very purpose of the law.

But the judiciary has pointed out that a large number of cases where elderly parents are being prosecuted are not bona fide. Your comments?

The judiciary cannot go by numbers alone. It has to treat every individual case as per its merit. ‚ÄòMisuse of law‚Äô is a sweeping generalisation, which then becomes a benchmark, quoted in support of the next judgment. Rulings in such cases cannot be made based on previous rulings, or mere police statements or general public opinions. If the judges wanted to establish that women misuse the law, they should have called for data from experts. They should have analysed at least a thousand cases of violence against women and then come to a rational conclusion.

Do we need to have gender-neutral laws? Shouldn‚Äôt there be strong action taken against people who abuse laws?

Across the world, women are subjected to domestic violence. This is not unique to India. However, in India, dowry deaths take this violence leagues ahead of rest of the world, and therefore, particularly here we need strong laws.

I agree that strong action must be taken against anyone who abuses law. I do not support elderly men and women being arrested and roped in for no reason by anyone. No law should be misused by anyone. An allegation by a woman is not enough to make an arrest. The police must investigate the matter and then register a complaint, under the sections they deem fit.

The court should direct its anger against the police and law enforcement agencies. Here the court has found a cure worse than the disease. Police powers have been given to welfare committees, who will decide whether an offence has occurred and whether a woman has faced violence. The purpose of powerful laws is defeated.

Isn‚Äôt it true that educated women with high aspirations are the ones who are misusing Section 498A of IPC?

Not at all. If a woman has an unhappy marriage, she will file for a divorce. Educated women are not manipulating law: they are walking out of the marriage.

Section 498A comes into the picture when a woman is subjected to violence. If we condemn terrorists or arsonists, how can we not be moved by the plight of a persecuted woman, who works hard for the sake of her family, and tries in vain to come to terms with the violence she is subjected to?

What has gone wrong? Why does SC have to issue new directives?

The criminal justice system in India has collapsed. I get complaints stating that when a complainant walks into a police station, he has to pay a bribe to get his complaint registered. There is a problem with police misusing their powers to make a quick buck. It is then that such myopic directives get issued. The court must direct its attention there."
4 Students From Bangalore Develop An App That Alerts You When You're Sleepy While Driving A Car,"Next time, when you yawn while steering your car, just slow down, stop and check where the nearest coffee shop is on your mobile phone with the help of this app.

According to a story done by BS, this app is made by four engineering students of Bengaluru's PES University.

Akshay Kumar, Saahil Kamath, Rahul B Prakash and Aviral Joshi who weren't college friends but met during an internship project at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore thought why can't technology be used to reduce accidents on the road. As a result, they made an app which alerts the driver if he or she yawns while driving.

The already patented image recognition and artificial intelligence based system will be available nearly 80 percent cheaper to the similar services available in high-end cars. The system for the individual car will be available between Rs 9000-12000."

All You Need To Know About The Exhilarating Jazzercise And Why It Can Burn A Hell Of A Lot Calories While You Have Fun!,"In a fitness industry-driven by the latest trends, a lot of us are devotees to the fancy moves that Zumba has to offer or the rigours that a CrossFit box puts you through. Indeed, the fitness industry has come a long way innovating itself through any opportunity it sees.

cincinnati.citymomsblog.com

Although fitness trends have come a long way since their inception there‚Äôs one that‚Äôs making a comeback with a bang. This blast from the past is called ‚ÄòJazzercise‚Äô'! Originally a rage in the 80‚Äôs, around the time Jane Fonda made Aerobics synonymous with the word fitness with the video empire she created on it, it makes a strong re-appearance in it's newly outfitted lively variant.

Jazzercise all began as a ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù warm-up of sorts

Judi Sheppard created Jazzercise while she was studying at the Northwestern University as a student when she saw a high number of dropout rates while she taught at a dance studio because the classes were too technical. Sheppard decided to turn the class from a technical to fun experience that included revolved around dance aerobics.

cdandlp.com

What initially started off as fitness classes that were designed ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù to retain clients is now a full-blown hundred-million-dollar-per-year company that ranks in the top 50 franchise list in Entrepreneur with more than 8,000 franchisees in over 30 countries.

So what is Jazzercise all about?

remzavibes.com

It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like jazz and exercise combined together. Back in the day, it used to be based on dance aerobics, while today Jazzercise boasts of multiple different elements. The classes integrate strength training using resistance tubes and weights helping women build muscle and bone density, boost metabolism, which helps them accelerate weight loss.

Is Jazzercise similar to Zumba?

mob.beautyme.meitu.com

The only thing that‚Äôs common between the two is the fact that they both combine dance with a component of exercise. The key difference is that Zumba primarily focuses on your cardiovascular fitness, while Jazzercise focuses on not just aerobics as well as strength training. Apart from moving around using dance are your central theme you will work on your entire body by even getting into strength training movements such as push-ups, bicep curl, crunches and so on.

Why is Jazzercise one of the most ass-kicking workout you can give yourself?

Jazzercise is a functional HIIT type workout. That means that unlike an activity like running or swimming to move in directions, it uses your body in ways that these activities cannot by working on different muscle groups, making it very functional and effective to improve your overall fitness. The constant acceleration and deceleration you put your body through ups your heart rate and burns up 600 calories or more in an hour.

Jazzercise is a great workout for your mind as well!

sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com

Every 10 weeks or so your instructor is most likely to shuffle in new music along with a variety of routines and steps to learn; forcing your mind to adapt and learn as you go. Learning new skills gives your memory a boost and betters your cognitive functioning‚Äîensuring protection from mental deterioration over time.

Who is Jazzercise ideally best suited for?

trabajoendeporte.es

Well, if you‚Äôre someone who gets bored of performing the same moves or exercises repeatedly the progressive Jazzercise could be a format you might want to explore. If the dynamic style of training, the ever-evolving routines alongside varied music, meeting new people and being part of a community, and the fact that you get to get to learn a few dance-like moves while getting in a good workout excites you in anyway, you may want to consider a 60-minute class for starters."
26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you‚Äôve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with ‚Äúaddiction of online binge watching‚Äù.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn‚Äôt let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."
Can Yogi do more for electricity than gau raksha?,"Uttar Pradesh has long been one of the worst administered states. Children‚Äôs deaths in Gorakhpur recently hogged the headlines, but are hardly new. Ex-bureaucrat V Ramani has unearthed an RTI response showing that between January 1, 2009 and November 30, 2011, 31,791 children were admitted to the Gorakhpur hospital, and no less than 3,745 died, 1,311 of encephalitis. Half the qualified medical posts and 40% of nursing posts were vacant. Similar problems afflict every sector in UP.

Like many predecessors, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has promised to overhaul governance. During a recent visit to Lucknow, two senior bureaucrats told me the Yogi was more serious than any chief minister for decades, and was not simply a Hindutva fanatic. Yet UP‚Äôs history has long been one of broken promises and dismal outcomes. Poor governance is deeply embedded, and will resist overhaul.

There are some green shoots. One of the most difficult areas to reform in any state is electricity. Huge subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers have plunged most state electricity boards deep into the red. Chief ministers need to bite the bullet and push through major tariff hikes and reductions in theft.

The Yogi has bitten the bullet. The state has proposed tariff hikes of up to 360% for different categories of rural and urban domestic consumers, the average hike being 22.6%. Industry rates have not been raised at all ‚Äî the state wants to attract industry, and its rates are already high. This is the very opposite of the populism typical of a new chief minister.

Can UP follow the Gujarat model? There, companies in generation, transmission and distribution all show profits. As Chief Minister, Modi cracked down on power theft, raised tariffs, metered and supplied power to almost all villages, and bifurcated electric feeders to villages. This enabled him to supply 24√ó7 power for domestic use and six hours per day for agricultural pumps.

Profitable industrial and commercial consumers account for 52% of consumption in Gujarat, against only 30% in UP, which cannot therefore depend on cross-subsidies from industry for farmers. It currently loses Rs 2.07 on every unit of power supplied. Apart from subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers, power theft and corruption are rampant. The state‚Äôs Aggregate Commercial and Technical (ACT) losses average 31% across its distribution companies. The Yogi seeks to slash this to 23% in a year, a huge challenge.

Technical losses in transmission should not exceed 8-9% of supply. Anything more represents theft and corruption. ACT loss is a whopping 60% in Meerut, where politically powerful vote banks and industries have long siphoned off power in collusion with corrupt electricity officials.

Checking theft requires strong police support. But police stations in UP are under-staffed and fully occupied with major crimes and public order. They have no time or staff to check electricity theft: unfilled vacancies for constables exceed one lakh.

Yogi‚Äôs radical reform proposal is to create one new police station in every district dedicated to checking electricity theft. That can be a game changer. A senior official says, ‚ÄúThis is the first government in my time to say we should go after all thieves without exceptions or mercy.‚Äù Brave words, but implementation has never been the state‚Äôs strong point.

Following court orders, exams are being held to hire one lakh constables. These will be based largely on objective questions in a written exam, not school marks, since cheating is so rampant that school marks mean nothing.

The state‚Äôs ‚ÄòElectricity For All‚Äô scheme aims to electrify every household by October 2018. That means doubling the current number of connections: an additional 1.12 crore rural and 15 lakh urban consumers are to be covered. Up to 10 lakh diesel gensets of farmers will also be converted to electricity. The Yogi claims rural power supply is up from 12 to 18 hours per day. Grassroots reports suggest substantial improvement though not to the extent claimed. Critics, including buffalo traders and meat processors, say the Yogi is keener on cow protection than electricity.

Officials claim that in four months, the BJP government has metered 3.25 lakh unmetered connections, and provided 12.5 lakh new connections. They say in the April-June quarter, electricity supply rose 18% while revenue jumped 30%, reflecting better collection.

Will this be sustained? Will the BJP resist the temptation to waive rural electricity dues when the next election approaches? Is the Yogi serious enough, and bureaucracy honest and efficient enough, to stop power theft and collect bills? Let‚Äôs see. The Yogi‚Äôs power reforms have started well, but have miles to go."

The workers also raised other issues that they had with the authorities, now that they are protesting. Things like regularisation of staff and clearance of arrears are some of their demands.

""At times, when we ask our relatives for money, they refuse to lend. We don't have that much of savings that will help us survive 2-3 months without salary. We are not going to resume work until we get our salaries."" said Manoj, one of the sanitation workers.

After five days into their protest and seemingly empty handed returns, the workers dumped garbage outside the residence of Trilokpuri MLA Raju Dhingan.

Why Skipping Breakfast Makes Your Child Undernourished,"If your child is in the habit of skipping breakfast regularly he or she may be falling well short of the daily required amounts of nutrients that are essential for their growth and development, claim the researchers of a recent study.

Reuters/representational image

The findings showed that 31.5 per cent of children who skipped breakfast did not meet even the lower recommended nutrient intake (LRNI) of iron.

While 19 per cent did not meet LRNI for calcium, 21.5 per cent did not meet lower levels of iodine and 7.3 per cent had a folate intake below their recommended nutrient intake level.

Reuters/representational image

On the other hand, children who ate breakfast every day were found to have higher daily intakes of key nutrients such as folate‚Äîimportant for the development of genetic material‚Äì, calcium, iron and iodine‚Äîkey in the development of thyroid function.

‚ÄúThis study provides evidence that breakfast is key for parents to ensure that their children are getting the nutrition they need,‚Äù said Gerda Pot, a lecturer at the King‚Äôs College London.

For the study, published in the British Journal of Nutrition, the team included 802 children aged from four to 10 years and 884 children aged 11 to 18 years.

Reuters/representational image

Breakfast was considered as consumption of over 100 calories between 6 and 9 a.m.

The study also showed that, in younger children (four to 10 years old), on days when breakfast was consumed, children had higher intakes of folate, calcium, vitamin C and iodine compared to their breakfast-skipping days.

Out of these same nutrients, for older children (11-18 years old) only calcium intakes were higher on breakfast-consuming days.

India willing to be bold through World Cup metamorphosis

‚Ä¢ Last updated on Sat, 19 Aug, 2017, 11:09 PM Gokul Gopal in Dambulla

As part of the experiment, KL Rahul has been confirmed as India's latest No. 4 in the 50-over format. ¬© AFP

'Experimenting' is a word that's being thrown around in Indian ODI cricket of late, with the focus on building a core group ahead of the World Cup in 2019. As part of the experiment, KL Rahul has been confirmed as India's latest No. 4 in the 50-over format, with the selectors of the opinion that he is ""too good a player"" to be left out. After being sidelined for the IPL, Champions Trophy and the series in the Caribbean, Rahul has returned to the Indian ODI side, having recently fared well in the Tests.

The number four hasn't been a permanent spot for a player from the Indian team in the last two years, with as many as nine having batted at that position since January 2015. Ajinkya Rahane, Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni, who've batted the most number of times at two-drop, have decent numbers. But the only remarkable performance came from Yuvraj's bat when he scored 150 against England in Cuttack in January this year, apart from Manish Pandey's unbeaten 104 against Australia in January 2016. However, Yuvraj failed to do justice to the spot in the innings to follow, which was also the case with Pandey, forcing the selectors to take a punt on Rahul.

Among the contenders in the current Indian team for the No. 4 spot are Rahane and Pandey, but the fact that they aren't guaranteed spots in the eleven, let alone the number 4, puts the spotlight on Rahul. Only an injury to one of the openers might prompt the Indian team management to elevate Rahul to the top of the order again, opening up spots in the middle order. But as of now, one middle-order position has been reserved for Rahul, as confirmed by the captain himself.

""We have players who have the ability to strike at 200, same players have the ability to play for 35 overs for you in a one-day game. It all depends on what you decide to do as a team and then move forward in that direction,"" Kohli said on the eve of the the opening ODI in Dambulla. And in Rahul, India appeared to have identified a batsman in the middle-order capable of seamlessly shifting gears between a consolidator and an aggressor.

Whether Rahul would get a long rope even if he fails in this series, remains to be seen. But it has left both Rahane and Pandey out of the current framework - a familiar situation for both as they'll again warm the benches and wait for a stamp of approval, unless the management deems an immediate change is necessary.

The series offers India a chance to experiment but it's the 'time-frame' and not the 'opposition' that will be the focus for Kohli and his team. One of those experiments is the current position offered to Rahul, assigning him a definite role to play. The other is the inclusion of a talented, but a relatively-new, spin attack which offers the exuberance of youth as against the experience of R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.

Having gone in with the traditional finger spinners for sometime now, there seems to be a shift in the thought process of the selectors and the team-management, who now perhaps think wrist spin is the way forward. Among the top-wicket taking spinners since 2015, the top-three are leg-break bowlers - Imran Tahir, Adil Rashid and Rashid Khan - while Ashwin barely makes it to the 10, and Jadeja much lower.

""If you give 30 in 10 overs and don't take wickets, last 10 overs that's going to be covered up,"" said Kohli, emphasizing that economy rates do not matter as much as wickets. In Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal, India have two quality options and variety, with the former's chinaman complementing the latter's leg-breaks. Even if Axar Patel's traditional left-arm spin is preferred, in a bid to hold one end up, India have at least one wrist spin bowler at the other end whose wicket-taking abilities would prove crucial.

For Kohli, it's the time-frame that matters and not the opposition when it comes to experimenting. Embracing new challenges with a view of the long-term goals of the team, the Indian captain is willing to risk losing a few matches along the way and accept the criticism that'll come with it.

""If you want to be world beaters and win everywhere in the world, you need to do certain things that are out of the box. So we're all ready to embrace that,"" said Kohli, not afraid to enforce changes. The next 12 months will be the time for certain experiments and how they turn out remains to be seen. But change seems to be the new mantra for the Indian ODI team.

Vaghela‚Äôs exit an opportunity for Cong to take a stand in Gujarat,"Shankarsinh Vaghela has quit the Congress party. As a Gujarati, I thank whatever gods may be. There is a larger point to be made and I‚Äôll come to that in a bit.

Vaghela was a dedicated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man who should never have been made head of the Gujarat Congress in the first instance. Hindutva has brutalised the state and permanently divided its people and ghettoised its minorities (an act of extreme anti-nationalism).

Congress should have stepped in to recover the truth in Gujarat‚Äôs culture of pacifism and mercantilism and pragmatism and progress. Instead, in appointing the Hindutvawadi Vaghela, the party continued the political lie that Hindus and Muslims are permanently at war and communal politics is inevitable. Rubbish.

There are those who say that with Vaghela‚Äôs exit the Congress will lose the assembly elections coming in that state in the next six months.

However, it should be pointed out to such geniuses that in his 20 years (he joined hands with the Congress in 1997) the party anyway saw defeat in every single assembly and Lok Sabha election. What great victories was this compromise with first principles bringing the Congress? Not one.

For my parents in Surat, all these years, the option inside the polling booth was always between endorsing an RSS Congress leader or an RSS BJP leader. That‚Äôs not really a choice.

If the Congress says it stands for Nehruvian secularism, then the first place that must show is in the people who speak for it and the second in what they say. The same rule applies to my friend Sanjay Nirupam, who heads the Congress in Mumbai. A pleasant fellow but a former Shiv Sainik. I believe in redemption and the idea of reformation, but such people as Vaghela and Nirupam, who jump from leadership position to leadership position without demonstrating their devotion to first principles are unfit.

To the larger point now. What will the 2019 general election be fought on? Given the damage Hindutva is doing to India and Indians, it is clear that it must be fought on an uncompromising anti-Hindutva platform. This should be accompanied by specific things, like the opposition to genius strokes like demonetisation. But the underlying narrative must be carried on the back of an Indian inclusivism that is natural to us and that we can see all around us.

The fact is that the image of India that Hindutva‚Äôs supporters hold is not apparent. We are a unified culture being deliberately and mischievously divided. How tough can it then be for the Congress to sell reality? My slogan: ‚ÄòIndians are one people. Stop dividing us through Hindutva‚Äô.

My colleague Salil Shetty has observed that we are living in a time of democratic authoritarianism, when the sort of mischief that only dictators pursued is today practised by elected despots.

His other observation is that among such ‚Äòstrongmen‚Äô type leaders, there are those who use violent and unhinged language, like the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and American president Donald Trump. And then there are people like Narendra Modi who speak softly but who have others do the speaking for them.

VP Singh said that to know what Hindutva stood for, do not listen to its leaders, but the people below. The poison that is being spread by Hindutva cannot be gleaned from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Twitter feed.

It can be understood by what is being done under him. Gujarat has already passed a law punishing cattle slaughter with life imprisonment, while Chhattisgarh‚Äôs CM has pushed for the death penalty. Modi‚Äôs criticism of vigilantes should start with attacking or sacking his party‚Äôs leaders who encourage the lynchings. But he won‚Äôt and that is the plan.

I am told often that many Indians conflate Hindutva with Hinduism. That is dangerous nonsense. Hindutva, a word of recent coinage, is a set of three specific political demands.

First, Musims must surrender their mosque (‚ÄòRam Janmabhoomi‚Äô). Second, Muslims must surrender their personal law (‚ÄòUniform Civil Code‚Äô). Third, Muslims must surrender their constitutional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir (‚ÄòArticle 370‚Äô).

After taking power, a fourth political demand has been pushed: Muslims must surrender their dietary habits (‚Äòcattle slaughter ban‚Äô). Hindutva is negative, sullen, passive-aggressive (observe the joyless faces of those who peddle it).

What links any of its demands with Hinduism the faith? Not a thing. It is anti-India in the worst way possible: it pushes an idiot nationalism that is ranged not at some enemy but against other Indians. Because of this, in my opinion, it borders on treason. It has to be resisted. Civil society will do what it can but the domain of this resistance is primarily politics.

The saying goes: if you don‚Äôt stand for something, you‚Äôll fall for anything. For two decades the Congress has fallen for soft communalism in Gujarat. The opportunity has come for it to stand."
Is Corporate Governance a mere mirage,"The proposal for approval of appointment of Mr. Deepak Kapoor, former Chairman of Pricewaterhousecoopers India (pwc) as an Independent Director of Tata Steel had already come in from severe criticism from no less than Mr. J.N. Gupta, former Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Mr. Gupta was quoted saying that, ‚ÄúIn our advisory note, we have asked shareholders to reject either of the appointment as there seems to be a conflict of interest if both proposals go through at once. Kapoor will disqualify as an independent director under section 149(6) of the Companies Act, if PwC is appointed as its auditor.‚Äù Mr. Gupta, further said that both Kapoor and PwC‚Äôs appointments together ‚Äúdoes not reflect good governance practice by the Tatas.‚Äù The ‚Äúmere presence‚Äù of Kapoor on the board of Tata Steel ‚Äúmay have an adverse impact on the audit process and may give rise to ethical issues,‚Äù he had added.

Yet, the appointment of Mr. Deepak Kapoor was approved in the annual general meeting (AGM) of Tata Steel held on August 8, 2017. In the same AGM, the appointment of Price Waterhouse & Co Chartered Accountants LLP (Audit firm) was also approved. Is it conceivable that TATAs, known for their high ‚Äúvalue systems‚Äù, grossly erred in making the two appointments ? The facts, unfortunately, suggest so.

As per the Notice of AGM, Mr. Kapoor met the criteria for independence as provided for in Section 149(6) of the Companies Act, 2013 and had also given a declaration to that effect. Is it possible that Mr. Deepak Kapoor gave a wrong declaration to Tata Steel ?

The real question boils down to whether provisions of Section 149(6)(e)(ii) were violated. This section provides, amongst others, that an Independent Director shall mean such a person who, neither himself nor any of his relatives is or has been an employee or proprietor or a partner, in any of the three financial years immediately preceding the financial year in which he is proposed to be appointed of a firm of auditors or company secretaries in practice or cost auditors of the company or its holding, subsidiary or associate company. The intention behind this disqualification is extremely important and abundantly clear : no person, who or whose relatives were employed by the auditors of the company during the last 3 years could be appointed as its Independent Director. Cooling period of 3 years was stipulated to avoid any potential conflict of interest.

Before I analyse any further, I must put a caveat; the analysis is as per my understanding of the law, is meant purely for the larger public interest and is not in any way whatsoever meant to reflect on the competence or otherwise of any individual or entity involved. A technical correction must also be made. The Audit firm appointed in the AGM is not Pwc but Price Waterhouse & Co Chartered Accountants LLP. The legal distinction needs to be appreciated.

Deepak Kapoor had been with Pwc India for 30 years and had initially served as an Audit partner. He went on to serve as the Chairman of Pwc India from 1st January 2011 upto 31 December 2016. Prior to this, he had served as the Managing Director of Pwc India for nearly 4 years since February 2007. The vital questions which arise are that what is Pwc India comprised of and what was Mr. Kapoor‚Äôs authority and control over its different constituents?

For the benefit of everyone, Pwc India refers to the network of a private limited company by the name of Pricewaterhousecoopers Private Limited (pwcpl) that renders Advisory services and more than 10-12 audit firms. All these supposedly separate legal entities use the same brand name, i.e., Pwc. It needs no emphasis that by being at the helm of affairs of Pwc India for nearly 12 years Mr. Deepak Kapoor had significant influence and control over the entire network including all the audit firms, including the one appointed as the Auditor of Tata Steel in the said AGM, although he was on the rolls of Pwcpl only.

SEBI‚Äôs regulations for Independent Directors are still wider. Even a material supplier, service provider, lessor or lessee to the company, irrespective of the value involved, is disqualified from being appointed as an Independent Director of the Company.

The intention of the lawmakers while formulating the law is invariably considered by the Courts to arrive at the right interpretation for any specific provision. The lawmakers probably thought that they have extensively and elaborately covered all situations that could result in conflict of interest. Apparently, they under-estimated or overlooked the ingenuity of some. What the Pwc India network stands for may not be known to all. However, Mr. Kapoor surely knew all about it. Did he make adequate and comprehensive disclosures to the Tata Steel Board ?

Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 states, amongst others, that an Independent Director shall uphold ethical standards of integrity and probity, refrain from taking any action that would lead to loss of his independence, must immediately inform the Board where circumstances arise which would make him lose his independence and assist the company in implementing best corporate governance practices. How has Mr. Deepak Kapoor fared on these parameters is best left to be adjudged by the public and the Regulators.

The intention of the law makers and the spirit of the law is further reinforced in the Rules under the Act for the rotation of Auditors. The said rules clearly state that ‚Äúsame network‚Äù includes the firms operating or functioning hitherto or in future under the same brand name, trade name or common control.

It is abundantly clear from the above that Mr. Deepak Kapoor was ineligible for appointment as the Independent Director of Tata Steel.

Tata Steel‚Äôs Chairman, Mr. N Chandrasekaran, while defending Kapoor‚Äôs appointment, was quoted by the media saying that Kapoor will not be inducted into the audit committee till the cooling period is over. Was Mr. Chandrasekaran not briefed properly that the embargo on the appointment of Deepak Kapoor extended to the past 3 years and not even a year had expired !

Corporate governance is going beyond the letter and mandate of the law. Adherence to best practices should not only be claimed but be demonstrated. Did the venerable house of TATAs violate the letter and the spirit of the law on two counts ? Are these the standards of Corporate Governance that we can be proud of ? Will this not set a bad and dangerous precedent to the detriment of public interest ? Will SEBI ensure immediate remedial action ? Will we ever get the answers. But one thing is clear. Public some janti hai !"
Hare Krishna!,"RADHANATH SWAMI helps us understand how Krishna can appear within us once we purify ourselves with sadhana



Krishna was born on Janmashtami day. It is also the day when he appeared in this world. As everyone knows, God is not born.He is beginning-less and endless but just as the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening,he appears to our vision at a certain time and that is called his birth. He then disappears from our vision which is called his disappearance.In fact, Krishna is the shining light of mercy. You all know that Devaki and Vasudev were married by an arrangement of Garga Muni and after the wedding ceremony, King Kamsa brought his sister Devaki to Vasudev‚Äôs kingdom. The demigods were anxious that Krishna should arrive soon on earth. So they spoke and their voice reverberated in the sky, ‚ÄúYou (Kamsa) are a fool; the eighth son of your sister, Devaki, will kill you.‚Äù Kamsa,a demon,had conquered the whole universe. On hearing from the demigods that the eighth son of Devaki would kill him,Kamsa was afraid for his life and he thought, what is the use of conquering the whole universe if he was not able to enjoy it,as he would get killed by Devaki‚Äôs eighth son. He then became ready to kill his own sister and grabbed her by the hair and drew his sword to sever her head,but Vasudev intervened and requested him to spare Devaki,saying,Kamsa had a threat from Devaki‚Äôs eighth son, and not Devaki herself. Vasudev promised Kamsa, saying, ‚ÄúYou have nothing to fear from your sister Devaki; it is her sons. I promise you, I will bring you each and every one of those sons and you can do as you like with them‚Äù. The first son born to Devaki and Vasudev was Kirtiman.Kamsa thought when the child was brought to him: I have nothing to worry for this first son, it is the eighth.‚ÄúSo you take this son back,‚Äùhe told Vasudev.Then Kamsa returned to his ministers and friends who were all terribly materialistic and demoniac. Somehow,they convinced him that ‚Äòany of these sons can be the cause of great trouble‚Äô. Narada Muni,in order to speed up the appearance of Krishna on earth, also added a few words of encouragement to Kamsa. So Kamsa called Vasudev and Devaki back and killed the first son ruthlessly and then put them in prison. During the next year, the second son was born and Kamsa killed him, too, and then the third son. One by one, he killed the first six children of Devaki. Now, there are many ways of perceiving what we are meant to learn through the killing of these six children. But we have to search deeply in the Bhagavatam and in the commentaries of great souls to understand what this means. So, after these six children were killed by Kamsa, Balarama appeared within the womb of Devaki.He was sent there to prepare the way for Krishna. Balarama‚Äôs job was to make that womb a very comfortable place for Krishna to appear. Balarama is the original guru. The spiritual master,who is God‚Äôs representative; he teaches us how to kill the six enemies ‚Äî lust, anger, envy, pride, greed and illusion ‚Äî but even after they have been extinguished in our hearts, we still require the help of a spiritual master to prepare our mind and our consciousness in such a way that it is a pleasing place for Krishna to appear. So Balarama prepared Devaki‚Äôs womb and then he was transferred to the womb of Rohini,who was actually his eternal mother and then Krishna appeared within the womb of Devaki. When he appeared, Devaki became effulgent; so beautiful, in fact, that the entire prison cell lit up with her aura. Devaki herself became the embodiment of such beauty that Kamsa and everyone knew in their hearts that now, Vishnu had appeared. They were simply waiting for the moment when they will have to meet face-to-face with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Janmashtami means not just the historial,astrological time when Krishna appeared in this world,but it means to us that we should understand the process by which Krishna can appear in our own lives. For that to happen, we must purify our hearts. Unless our hearts are pure, we cannot understand Krishna‚Äôs appearance and his activities and we cannot be free from suffering.We can take to a religion, we can affiliate with a particular congregation, we can perform many rituals, but ultimately, we must purify our hearts and that is the whole purpose of the association of devotees. It is actually the only purpose ‚Äî of taking to a process of religion or performing any ritual or doing any sadhana in order to become pure.



Greater Strength



We should not think that religion is simply meant to live a better life in this world; in fact you will get that if you live religiously. But whatever nice arrangements you make in this world will culminate in death,old age,disease; you cannot avoid it. Real religion is to reawaken our eternal consciousness and that comes through purification of the mind and heart and through unalloyed, motivated devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Krishna cannot be impressed by what we can do,how much money we can give,how many austerities we perform, how many days we can fast,how many hours we can stand on the tips of our toes,whether we can stand on our heads, how wonderfully we can chant mantras or memorise scriptures.We do all these things not to gain recognition, but to become purified from within. When we are purified, when we develop humility and sincerity, this is what real religion means.Krishna is only attracted to purity,humility and sincerity. So that is why Srila Prabhupada, Iskcon‚Äôs founder, insisted ‚Äî as all the great acharyas also insisted ‚Äî that one must follow four regulative principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat eating. Because, when we are doing our sadhana, we are being purified. If you engage in these activities, you will further pollute yourself.We want to overcome these enemies; we do not want to give them strength.Every time you give in to meaningless rituals, you are giving the enemies within your mind, greater strength and longevity, and they will overcome you. Ultimately, Krishna killed Kamsa. He appeared in this world, directly, in his original personal transcendental form,5,000 years ago through his wonderful pastimes which are revealed in the Srimad Bhagvatam and the Puranas, through his teachings of Bhagwad Gita, through his holy names: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,Krishna Krishna,Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

6 stages of sex in your married life,"Here‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt believe those horror stories of how dirty talk with your partner after marriage will only mean discussing laundry, garbage and bills.

Can‚Äôt-get-my-hands-off-you sex

That time when you find excuses to grab their behind on their way to the restroom or steal a quick kiss at the dinner table before your in-laws enter the room.

Honeymoon sex

Enter the kinky stage. The house is yours to make dirty, and if not, then you will find yourself holidaying more often‚Äîthe Kama Sutra book in hand.

Settling-in sex

Your to-do list in the evenings reads something like: cook dinner ‚Äì read book/watch TV ‚Äì have sex. Sex has become part of your day or week‚Äôs timetable and you know just when you two will do it that night.

Let‚Äôs make a baby

During this period, you will end up having more sex than what was on your timetable and in newer, baby-friendly positions. Also, once you are preggers, the action only gets hotter and your husband will be convinced that you are your sexiest with a baby bump.

The dreadful drought

This doesn‚Äôt hit everyone, but during this phase, sex could go completely off the table and you two would be almost okay with it.

Breaking-the-drought sex

When you want to end the dry spell so you send the kids off to their grandparents‚Äô, and welcome him home with a smile on your face, wearing nothing but a trench coat."

Buy HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX (2FK60PA) Laptop (Core i5 7th Gen/8 GB/1 TB 8 GB SSD/Windows 10/2 GB) Online at Best Price in India,"NEW DELHI: Hewlett-Packard has been a brand to reckon with when it comes to laptops and PCs. It has always made its presence felt in top ranks with some of the best value-for-money offerings. However, from time to time one needs to keep growing its product portfolio and HP has done just that this year, at least in India.After expanding its Omen range of gaming laptops and PCs in the country, the US-based PC-maker recently refreshed its 'Pavillion' laptop series with the x360 hybrid-laptop. You'll have to shell out Rs 40,290 for its base model (11-inch screen variant). The most powerful variant goes for Rs 80,000 and upwards. With the Pavilion x360, HP aims to bring a powerful yet good looking computing machine, rounding off the hybrid-laptop as a complete package.We assessed the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX), which is priced at Rs 72,290 and have loads to talk about its performance and design. Curious if it comes with all the hallmarks of an all-in-one laptop? The review below might help you contemplate the decision.HP, since last year, started focussing more towards the design of its laptops and hybrid laptops rather than concentrating only on the performance. While its high-end 'Spectre' range was already visually appealing, a major shift in the overall laptop design strategy across other sub-brands was seen ever since the launch of the HP Spectre, which still remains one of the thinnest laptop ever.The Pavilion x360 plays on the same idea and brings a spin of ""premiumness"" with it. The 2-in-1 laptop looks elegant as it is complimented by a brushed metal look from all sides. The HP logo comes with a mix of mirror finish and so do the laptop hinges, all of which look decent when teamed up in a single package. Although negligible, the power button on the side and the rim enclosing the touchpad also sport the same shiny metallic look.The backlit keyboard adopts the same brushed metal appearance, making the design profile stable across the board. The speaker grille is placed above the keyboard layout. Although we'll talk about the audio quality later, what may bother few users is the placement of the speaker itself. Given the 2-in-1 design of the laptop, the dual speakers, while using the x360 in certain modes, throw the sound in completely opposite direction. For instance, when using in the tent mode you'll notice the speaker facing outwards, which is not much appreciated.The laptop is neither extremely slim, nor is it extremely light-weight. It is thick but not like your regular laptops. The device weighs 1.32 kg, which is considerably low as compared to some chunky workstations out there.HP has made sure that its Pavilion x360 doesn't excise on anything when it comes to connectivity. Majority of the left side of the Pavilion x360 is taken by the exhaust grille along with the power button on the corner, 3.5mm headphone slot and volume controllers. On the right, there is a charging slot, two USB 3.0 slots, a mini HDMI slot, a USB 2.0 Type-C slot and a card reader, all of which are used on a daily basis.Coming to the screen, the review unit we received (HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX) sported a 14-inch display with support for touch for easy use. The resolution carried here is 1080x1920 pixels (full HD), which in our opinion is decent enough for a 14-incher. QHD displays do add to the clarity and soar the pixel density, but for an everyday user full HD seems appropriate.At any point in time you can switch from traditional typing to touch screen without even folding the 2-in-1 to activate the tablet mode. Like we've seen with almost all the Windows 10 hybrid laptops, the Pavilion x360 too automatically changes the layout of the apps and the home screen as soon as it crosses the 180-degree folding angle.The usual options to tweak the brightness and dimness of the screen, activating Bluelight filter, changing fonts, text sizes, screen resolution and screen orientation are present. In the tablet mode, the screen auto rotates based on how you are holding the device, something which is common with nearly all the hybrid laptops. Watching movies and TV shows online was a delight. Watching 4K videos on the full HD screen won't make a difference in your viewing experience.The HP Pavilion x360 unit we received is one of the high-end variants in the series. Other variants come with different processor, RAM and screen size combinations. Our unit, the one which runs quad-core Intel Core i5 - 7200U ('Kaby Lake' 7th generation) processor, slid across apps like a hot knife on butter, giving zero lags at any given point of time. The processing power is complemented with 8GB RAM, which is once again, pretty decent for everyday use. With 1TB hard drive, you can store a bunch of TV shows and movies as well.Playing games, editing documents, videos and images were smooth and so was browsing through social media apps like Facebook, Messenger, Mails and more, courtesy Intel HD Graphics 620 and Nvidia GeForce 940MX GPU with dedicated 2GB DDR3 memory.Changing the laptop mode to tablet mode is also swift. Like it's the case with almost all hybrid laptops, you can use the Pavilion x360 in Stand Mode, Tent Mode, Tablet Mode and the usual Laptop mode. Binge watching movies and TV shows are something you will appreciate on the Pavilion x360 as the full HD display works in tandem with Bang & Olufsen-tuned speakers. However, the screen is reflective more than usual, so using it with artificial lights around could prove to be a hassle.The laptop scores 4250 on PC Mark and P8 194 on 3D Mark, both of which are pretty decent given the latest processor, 8GB RAM and the Nvidia-powered GPU.The device's user experience comes festooned with Windows 10 Home which is fast and comes with usual set of features, including Cortana. Some pre-installed apps however, can spoil the essence of an impressive user experience. HP Pavilion x360, above and beyond Windows 10, packs bloatware with some unwanted apps such as Agoda.com, WildTangent Games app, Minecraft and Solitaire. There are some HP-made apps as well like HP AudioSwitch, HP Orbit, HP Pen Control.Talking about the HP Pen Control, the laptop comes with a stylus. The stylus definitely bumps up the productivity of a user but is not as fluid as you would expect. The HP Pen Control app you can assign different actions to the stylus' two buttons. You would also have to change the single-cell AAAA battery that goes inside the stylus.As for the apps and services, HP Pavilion x360n also includes MS Office Home & Student 2016 Lifetime full version worth Rs 5999.You won't face any heating issues with the Pavilion x360 no matter you run 4K videos, play games, stream content online or perform all these actions while keeping the hybrid laptop plugged into a charging point.Video chatting is nothing but smooth sailing with the Pavilion x360. The images clicked by the webcam are in HD resolution and the videos shoot in the same resolution at 30 frames per second, something that makes it just enough to make the cut when it comes video calling.The history of battery performance with hybrid laptops have been pretty average and somewhat consistent since last couple of years. Most of them work for a few hours, given the heavy processing of apps. With the HP Pavilion x360 the case is slightly unusual. The laptop, as HP says, has a 'liberating' battery life as it can run for up to 9 hours and 15 minutes on a single charge. However, this is in ideal conditions. In our day-to-day usage, the device ran for around 7 hours before giving up.Heavy usage, which includes streaming videos, playing 4K movies and playing heavy games may result in even quicker drainage of battery.The HP Pavilion x360 certainly raises the level of game every other PC maker is playing when it comes to mid-range laptops in India. The sub-brand, which once was known for offering mid-range laptops, although is moving towards more premium price bracket, it still takes some cues from other sub-brands as well such as the Spectre in terms of design and HP Envy in terms of performance.The device is an amalgamation of one of the best processors along with impressive speakers, decent screen, an average battery life, all encapsulated in a good-looking design. There are no such features that are either egregious or garish with the Pavilion x360.At Rs 72,290, the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX) is neither for heavy gaming nor for hardcore tasks. Instead, this hybrid laptop is something which could prove to be a hit not only with multimedia consumers but with young generation graphic designers as well who don't want their laptops to be extremely high-end ones with beefy innards and chunky look. They want a well performing laptop that looks good and can also be used casually. And HP seems to have hit that very nerve with the Pavilion x360."
5 Simple Ways To Help You Get Exactly What You Want In Bed,"It‚Äôs the weekend and you‚Äôre in the mood for some steamy sensual sex with your dream man or woman. The only problem is that as much you want things to come spontaneously rarely does your partner tune into your desires from the word go; especially if you guys are in the initial phases courtship.

universityprimetime.com

Phrases like ‚Äúcan you go down on me‚Äù or ‚Äúcan you squeeze me here‚Äù are often at the tips of your lips but seem so hard to let out‚Äîdisrupting that mind-blowing sex you so desire. Here are some ways your work around some of the most common reasons that might be blockading your path to fulfilling sex.

#1. Make sure you know what you want

Some of you may realise and some may not, but if you‚Äôre not sure what turns you on under the sheets either you‚Äôll be making the wrong request or end up never knowing what really excites you.

lmt-lss.com

What to do: Get curious about what you prefer by exploring your body by yourself. During your next sexual encounter try and figure out what feels or what you think feels more pleasurable by experimenting without holding back.

#2. Communication is the key even in the bedroom

The fact that you might upset your partner may be at the back of your mind but if you don‚Äôt communicate what you prefer in bed, how do you expect your partner to know?

medicalpress.es

What to do: Start with small compliments like ‚Äú I love it when you touch me there‚Äù in a sweet and straightforward tone and see how your partner responds. There‚Äôs more likelihood of you getting a better response so you can ask for bigger requests.

#3. Be his/her guide while you‚Äôre in the act

Some of us have our fantasies, fetishes, likes and dislikes well scripted in our mind. Use this information to your advantage by showing your partner what you like.

sexlovepizza.com

What to do: If you know that you like being touched in a certain area for instance either spell it out or guide his/her hand to area or spot you want to caress. Tell your partner what you want while you‚Äôre doing so to make your request even more specific.

#4. Use sensual video footage or erotica‚Äôs to build arousal

This is ideal for people who are not fans of physically or mentally expressing their desires since arousal starts in your brain anyway.

luaquebrada24x7.blogspot.in

What to do: Have your partner read an erotic scene from a movie/book or role-playing a character from a bondage, dominance, submission and masochism film (if you're kinky in the head) might be just what you need to spice things up.

#5. Never fake it if you want pleasure in the long run

You‚Äôve been faking an orgasm because you feel the need to please or not to hurt your partner somehow. Unfortunately, this may only get your partner to think that he or she has figured the secret code out and it may be hard to change correctly that behaviour.

femeia.ro

What to do: Be honest and first be frank about the fact that you faked it because you were too embarrassed to share your what you originally felt and then state what you really are into. If you don‚Äôt want to mention the fact that you‚Äôve been faking it you can try and squeeze in the fact that you would like to explore and experiment with new techniques.

The visit comes against the backdrop of the ongoing standoff between India and China over Doklam. And as a country surrounded by the two Asian giants, Nepal is bound to be affected by the ebb and flow of the India-China relationship. This is even more of a fact today as Nepal is seeking to come out of its geopolitical shell. Therefore, how the Doklam standoff pans out is as important for Kathmandu as it is for New Delhi and Beijing.

Needless to say, conflict between India and China would be disastrous for the trans-Himalayan region. Nepal, which is still recovering from the 2015 Giant Earthquake and is yet to fully operationalise its new Constitution, would not want India-China tensions over Doklam to escalate. It is absolutely imperative for Nepal to have peace in its neighbourhood so that it can conclude provincial and national elections by January 2018. Failure to do so would create yet another constitutional crisis in the Himalayan nation and delay development projects further.

In this respect, it‚Äôs understandable that Nepal needs both India and China for its development and prosperity. Nepal has already signed on to China‚Äôs flagship ‚ÄòOne Belt One Road‚Äô project of transnational connectivity. This is bound to give infrastructure building in Nepal a substantial boost. However, Nepal‚Äôs historic, geographic, political, ethnic, religious and cultural connections with India are far deeper. Kathmandu‚Äôs links with New Delhi go way beyond money and investments. Therefore, for durable peace and development in Nepal, Kathmandu simply can‚Äôt ignore its ties with New Delhi.

Given this scenario, Nepal is uniquely placed to mediate between India and China. Of course, such mediation must be done quietly and behind closed doors. Nevertheless, Kathmandu can be trusted with this task as it is in its own interest to bring New Delhi and Beijing on the same page. All three countries are immediate neighbours. And when two neighbours have a dispute, it is the responsibility of other neighbours to encourage and facilitate resolution.

Allowing Kathmandu to serve as an interlocutor also makes sense for India-Nepal relations. For far too long there has been an impression that New Delhi interferes in Nepal‚Äôs internal matters. Such an impression isn‚Äôt good for the future of India-Nepal ties. As highlighted by the five-month-long Madhesi blockade in 2015-16, suspicion of Indian interference can dent New Delhi‚Äôs credibility in Nepal overnight. Hence, the last thing that India should do is give the impression it is holding Nepal on a tight leash. In this context, having Nepal mediate between India and China will enhance Kathmandu‚Äôs independent geopolitical profile.

Besides, India has nothing to fear from this. As I mentioned before, India has deep ties with Nepal that no country can replace. Thus, New Delhi should see PM Deuba‚Äôs India visit as an opportunity to assert the concept of equal partnership between the two countries. Such an approach will take India-Nepal relations to heights rivalling the Himalayas."

Shikhar Dhawan's Blitzkrieg Propels India To First Win Of The ODI Series Against Sri Lanka,"Shikhar Dhawan is currently walking the best patch of his cricketing career. After a phenomenal Test stint against Sri Lanka, he has now roared against them in the ODIs as well. As Sri Lanka posted a paltry target of 217 runs, India were poised to win the match. But Dhawan made it look all-the-more easy.

Twitter

He blasted the Sri Lankan bowling and made his fastest century in the ODI format. He scored 132 runs off 90 deliveries. His 100 came up in just 71 deliveries.

Twitter

He also became the fastest centurion from India on Sri Lankan soil.

Twitter

After a decent start, Sri Lanka were bundled out for a meagre 216 as Axar Patel bowled exceptionally well to derail the islanders. Then came the Indian batting which was dominated by Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan.

India reached their target within 29 overs. Thanks to a decent start by Dhawan and Rohit Sharma, who was unfortunately run out.

Bruised and battered, Windies stare at a steep learning curve

‚Ä¢ Last updated on Sun, 20 Aug, 2017, 02:55 AM Rob Johnston in Birmingham

Jermaine Blackwood was the only bright spark in a forgettable batting display for WI. ¬© Getty

It was a catastrophic third day at Edgbaston for the Windies. Ill-disciplined and lacking in both skill and fight, the tourists were outgunned by a far stronger England team. The visitors lost 19 wickets, a feeble batting display to go with their slapdash bowling in the first innings. It has not been good watching.

Nor has their capitulation been a surprise. The Windies are ranked eighth in the world in Test cricket and England are third. The men from the Caribbean have not won a Test series since 2014 and have won just five Tests away from home in the last ten years, three of which came against Bangladesh before the Asian side's recent improvement. It has been a long time - too long - since West Indies were a Test match force.

The current group to don the maroon caps are young and inexperienced. They have just one player, Kraigg Brathwaite, who has played more than 100 first-class games. In contrast, only one player, Toby Roland-Jones, has not reached the three-figure mark for England. Just two of this Windies team have played Test cricket in England before and six of them have played 12 Tests or less.

Which makes their performance in this match, as disappointing as it was, somewhat understandable. The players are learning the game at the highest level, trying to compete against seasoned internationals when they barely know their own games. An example: Alzzari Joseph, with just 21 first-class matches, has been pitted against Alastair Cook, England's highest ever Test run scorer and a man who may become the leading run scorer in Test history. Good luck with that, Alzzari.

Somehow, the most talented young West Indians have to play more tough first-class cricket before they get in the Test team. Only then can the batsmen learn more discipline and patience, knowing when to attack and when to defend. Only then can the bowlers develop more consistency of line and length. Only then will these players develop. At the moment, this is a team ill-equipped for Test cricket.

How they get more first-class exposure is the difficult question. The domestic competition in the Caribbean is lacking quality and depth and many of the region's better and more experienced players are plying their trade in T20 tournaments around the world. When Miguel Cummins goes back to play domestic cricket, he's not bowling to Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo or Keiron Pollard. He's bowling to lesser players and getting away with the type of loose balls that Cook and Joe Root gorged on in England's first innings.

Away from the Test team, West Indies 'A' have played just nine first-class matches since 2012, which has meant the likes of Joseph have been plucked straight from the Under-19 team in to Test cricket. It is not an impossible jump to make successfully but it happens rarely and a regular programme of 'A' team cricket would expose these cricketers to more intense first-class cricket. Cricket West Indies have recognized this and have scheduled three 'Tests' against Sri Lanka 'A' and three against England Lions in the next six months.

There is talent in this team. Kraigg Brathwaite, who already has a Test double hundred, has made a decent start to his career and coach Stuart Law, a good judge of a batsman, reckons Shai Hope has the talent to become one of the world's best. Jermaine Blackwood's fighting spirit, on show during his 79 not out today, has been evident many times before and Shannon Gabriel, when fit, is a real handful with the ball. Twenty-year-old Joseph has plenty of potential, too.

Cricket West Indies must do all it can to nurture this talent. Law's appointment is a good one for he will bring some hardnosed street smarts to this young team and he needs to address his players' technical flaws and make them more consistent. An increase in funding from the ICC should help the board do more with 'A' team cricket and the domestic structure and the in-fighting that has dogged West Indian cricket for a decade has to stop. The appointment of Johnny Grave as chief executive holds promise in that regard.

There will be short-term pain like here at Edgbaston while these players develop but Law will expect at least more application than his side showed in this match. Given some improvement, it is still unlikely that there are the raw materials in the Caribbean to develop a world beating side but they will hope to develop a more competitive team over the next 18 months or so. A good place to start would be at Headingley next week.

"Bengaluru To Soon Have India's First Heli Taxi, Will Fly You To The Airport At The Cost Of A Cab","There's this one joke that always cracks me up about Bengaluru's traffic. A guy left for the airport to pick his girlfriend up, who was coming from Pune and they both left at the same time.

Faking News

As joke-worthy all these stories may seem, the traffic in India's hottest metropolitan city can be a real pain for those who live there. Imagine taking hours to cover a meagre distance or spending more than half your salary just on petrol.

Amid this crisis, the news of heli-taxi comes as an overdue respite. Folks in Bangalore will now have a cheaper and quicker alternative to fight the city's notorious traffic.

jagranjosh

India's first chopper taxi service was announced earlier this month and Bengaluru is the city to have these operations commence by December 2017. Authorities at the Bengaluru International Airport Ltd. (BIAL) have tied up a deal with the Thumby Aviation, a Kerala based helicopter service to facilitate the heli-taxi service.

The service will shuttle the passengers from city to the airport on demand and at a price equivalent to that of taxis. For instance, a ride from Electronic City, Bengaluru to Kempegowda International Airport will take 15 minutes on average, a fraction of the 90-150 minutes it can take by road.

pragnyajit mohapatra

Initially, the one six seaters Bell 407 chopper will operate on the routes, but it will soon be expanded to Whitefield and the HAL airport in the near future. That said, city's 90 helipads will now come alive to serve people who'd flown from different locations.

Shortly after a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, PM Modi is understood to have said that he was extremely unhappy with the recent tendency of some ministers' preference to stay in five-star hotels instead of accommodation that the government provides.

The PM made it clear to the ministers that they should stick to government accommodation while on official duty and not give into the ""temptation"" of staying in five star hotels, sources said.

He also told his ministers that he was unhappy with reports of some of them using vehicles from public sector undertakings under their ministries. The PM made it clear that he would not tolerate any misuse of vehicles of PSUs, either by ministers or their families.

PM Modi is learnt to have minced few words as he expressed concern over the signs that some ministers may have begun to use the perks of office. This has created a commotion with several ministers instructing their staff to ensure that no vehicles from PSUs are included for personal use. The ministers have also asked their personal staff to ensure that no ""perks"" from PSUs are entertained for personal use.

The PM is learnt to have made it clear that he will brook no compromise with his 'zero tolerance to corruption' stance. With two years to go for the 2019 general elections, the PM should be keen to ensure to maintain the ""scam-free"" image of the government.

Akshay Kumar‚Äôs latest Toilet: Ek Prem Katha has been tagged as a ‚Äòpropaganda film‚Äô by some sections but the actor today said there is nothing wrong in raising relevant issues, which even the government is concerned about, through cinema.

Directed by Shree Narayan Singh, the film stars Akshay in the lead role of a man, who tries to win back his wife by building a toilet at his home.

However, the criticism didn't go down too well with Akshay and he went onto defend his film and choices. He said,

‚ÄúIf the government is saying the same thing which is good and if you call that a propaganda, then okay we are doing propaganda. I believe building a toilet is extremely important, especially for women.""

Akshay also spoke about his upcoming film Padman and explained why it's an important film. He said,

‚ÄúI am talking about sanitary pads in ‚ÄòPadman‚Äô and you‚Äôll be sad to know that 91 per cent of women don‚Äôt use it because they can‚Äôt afford it. To talk about such things and bring them in the forefront isn‚Äôt propaganda. You want such issues to be highlighted and talked about,‚Äù said Akshay in a press conference via Skype from London.

Toilet is one of the most commercially successful films of the year but Akshay explained how it's not about numbers anymore. Instead, all he wants is people to watch his film that has an important message.

Hope to learn from the India series: Steven Smith

‚Ä¢ Last updated on Sat, 19 Aug, 2017, 06:56 PM Atif Azam in Dhaka

Smith is wary of Bangladesh's recent rise in Test cricket. ¬© Getty

Australian skipper Steven Smith believes that spin and reverse swing will be key ingredients of the upcoming two-match Test series against Bangladesh.

""Spin will play a big part throughout this series. Reverse swing will be expected because the wicket will be abrasive,"" Smith said on Saturday (August 19).

Smith said that he expects a tough challenge from the hosts, who have recently been on the rise in Test cricket. Bangladesh drew with England in their last home series, winning one of the Tests, and also beat Sri Lanka at home to mark their 100th Test match.

""It will be a challenging series,"" said Smith. ""Bangladesh have played some brilliant cricket here. They beat England in a Test match here not too long ago. I think they have played some very good cricket here of late.

""Conditions are always foreign to us when we are in the subcontinent. The wickets are always not what we get at home.""

Smith said that he is expecting his boys to deliver, taking a cue from what they learned from the last Test series against India, as the weather and the conditions are going to be quite similar.

""I hope we can learn from the last Test series in India. I expect we will come across some pretty similar wickets, similar amount of spin. Hopefully we can learn from what we did there.""

Smith played safe when questioned about the favorites tag Australia seem to carry into the series. ""I am not picking a favourite,"" he said.

""We have to be confident in our skill set and hopefully we can get our processes right and have a really good series.""

The right-handed batsman added that he is on a mission to change the fortune of the Aussies in the subcontinent. ""Australia have won only two Test matches in the last 10 years in the subcontinent, courtesy their victories over India and Sri Lanka. Now it is an opportunity for us to change that. I thought we did some things really well in India.

""We just needed to do it for little bit longer, and consistently. This is another opportunity to showcase our skills, show what we learned over there and hopefully give our best foot forward.""

Australian team arrived at Dhaka on Friday (August 18) and will play two Test matches that are scheduled to be hosted in Dhaka and Chittagong.

Weather is set to be a concern for cricket though the last two days have been sunny. Smith seemed well aware of the weather that awaits him and his team.

""Hopefully the weather holds off and we can get some good cricket in the series,"" Smith said. ""There is some rain around. We don't know how much time curators gonna get to give to the wicket. We will have to adapt to whatever wicket we come up against on the first morning of the Test match.""

Didi no.1: Mamata is to Bengal as Modi is to north India,"Trinamool Congress‚Äôs sweep in the latest round of civic body elections in Bengal puts aside any doubts regarding its political dominance in that state. Winning all seven civic agencies spread across north and south Bengal, Trinamool secured a mammoth 140 out of 148 wards. Among the opposition BJP won six wards, the Left Front just one, and Congress couldn‚Äôt even open its account. This comes after Trinamool made inroads in the hills of Bengal by winning the Mirik municipality in May. Taken together, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is today Bengal‚Äôs undisputed leader, much like Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the No.1 politician at the national level.

In fact, among the ranks of opposition parties on the national stage, Mamata is surely the most dominant. She has combatively taken on BJP both within Bengal and at the Centre. She has decimated the Left and left Congress listless. Her political machinery in Bengal is ruthless. With BJP gaining some traction in the state at the expense of Trinamool‚Äôs minority appeasement, Mamata has played the ‚ÄòBengali pride‚Äô and linguistic chauvinism cards to counter the Hindutva card.

So could Mamata be the leader opposition parties are looking for to take on Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls? The answer is negative. Mamata doesn‚Äôt have the pan-India appeal that Modi commands. She is very much a Bengali leader and has failed to make political gains outside her state. Nor does she have a stellar development track record ‚Äì industrialisation and job growth in Bengal continue to be lacklustre. Plus, Mamata‚Äôs mercurial temperament is a hindrance to coalition building. At this point the only thing she offers the opposition is hope that the BJP juggernaut can be halted. Nonetheless, Didi reigns supreme in Bengal even if Modi has much of north India."
Trade wars and the Great China Wall: How India can get its act together for a China-smart trade policy,"‚ÄúA trade war between China and India seems to be looming as India moved last Wednesday (August 9) to impose anti-dumping duties on 93 products from China. Now Chinese companies must reconsider the risks of investing in India amid strained bilateral trade ties, and India should also be prepared for the possible consequences for its ill-considered action.‚Äù Thus spake Global Times, organ of Chinese state media, on August 13. But what is the reality of India-China trade?

India exported goods worth $10 billion to China in 2005. India had a trade surplus with China during 2003-5, reveals trade data maintained by China. In 2016 Indian exports are still about $10 billion, but its trade surplus has turned into a deficit of more than $50 billion. What happened in the intervening years? The trade deficit was largely the result of China‚Äôs technical advancement. But China‚Äôs strategy to stifle Indian imports also played an important part.

During 2005-16 India emerged as a competent global supplier of polished diamonds, small cars, generic medicines, buffalo meat, etc. China imports these products in large quantities for domestic consumption, but not Indian products.

How does China reject Indian products? Quality cannot be a problem as India exports these products to over a 100 countries, including the US and EU. So China uses a complex set of inspection, product testing and quality certification requirements to stifle imports from India. Such restrictions are called non-tariff barriers (NTBs). WTO rules regulate import tariffs but are weak on regulating NTBs.

Chinese experts inspect Indian factories. Cost is borne by the Indian side and clearance seldom comes. Only Chinese labs do the product testing, and no appeal is allowed on their decisions. Punitive product testing requirements ensure that India cannot export buffalo meat to China. China will not accept Indian basmati rice, while Pakistan‚Äôs rice is welcome. Again, no appeal allowed on the decisions. Issuance of quarantine certificates for fruits or vegetables may take 3 years. Indian IT firms cannot take part if the tender size is more than $100 million. The list of restrictions is long.

Such measures ensured that India‚Äôs exports to China in 2016 stayed at the 2005 level, even as India allowed almost unrestricted access to Chinese goods during 2005-17. Of Indian imports of mobile phones, telecom equipment, and bulk drugs, 70% come from China. If China stops supplying bulk drugs India‚Äôs pharma exports will have a tough time, but China is already working to move up the value chain.

More than 95% of Indian imports of everyday use items also come from China. It is time to reduce this critical dependence on China. A time bound action plan to manage imports and increase exports can incorporate the following steps.

Push for large scale manufacturing in 30 product groups from electronics, engineering and chemical sectors. Accounting for 92% of imports from China, these should form the core of Make in India programme. Provide 20 years direct tax holiday for investments in these sectors.

Create a hundred design studios for new product development. Put in place the German Mittelstand model of industry-research-academia collaboration. This will help innovation-driven small firms and reduce dependence on import of daily use goods.

Create an institution responsible for developing standards and setting guidelines for inspection, testing and quality certification of critical products. China‚Äôs NTB regime was aided by a lack of Indian preparedness on these issues. Thereafter, use NTBs to manage harmful imports as everyone else does. China used NTBs to maim India‚Äôs exports without anyone realising what is happening. Anti-dumping duties can be used as short term measures but create too much noise.

Be more diligent in trade negotiations. For example India‚Äôs signing the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) in 1997, which was voluntary, blocked development of India‚Äôs IT hardware industry.

Finally, the truth about the Global Times story. Anti-dumping duties on 93 Chinese products were already in force for a long time. It was not a new development, although given the usual Chinese spin."
China moves its gears to Integrated Strategic Deterrence,"China getting frustrated at the Dokalm stand-off is moving its war propaganda machinery from ‚ÄúThree Warfares‚Äù to the next higher level in its ‚ÄúIntegrated Strategic Deterrence‚Äù doctrine against India to achieve its objective of withdrawal of the Indian troops. It has opened other fronts at the border to project that it could raise the level of the present stand-off to a full-fledged war. Stone pelting incident at the Pangong Tso on the 15th August is a testimony of this stratagem.

In the above context, it is important to understand what the Chinese objective behind such acts is. Strategically speaking, China is in expansionist mode. Since 1949, China in accordance with its well-crafted strategy is expanding its territory. After consolidating itself through the demographic changes in Tibet and brutally crushing the Tibetan autonomy supporters resulting in the suicide of several monks, it has decided to annex more and more territory in the periphery.

Since the Xi‚Äôs coming into power, China has adopted an aggressive policy to acquire territories in its periphery in three areas- South China Sea, East China Sea and at the Sino-Indian border in accordance with its 18th Century expansionist mind-set. The Chinese strategy has several steps to achieve its objective of acquiring territories without firing a bullet in line with Sun Tzu‚Äôs advice that supreme art of war is to subdue enemy without fighting. Overall the strategy is ‚ÄúIntegrated Strategic Deterrence‚Äù.

This has the aim of achieving strategic deterrence by non-fighting means or fighting a small war. Several military and non-military capabilities like nuclear, conventional, space and information warfare, economic, diplomatic, scientific and technological as also the collective will of the nation constitute the ‚ÄòIntegrated Strategic Deterrence‚Äô. This demands the following three components-

1. Possession and projection of an adequate credible military force.

2. The will and determination to use that force.

3. Communication using different means to the adversary that such a force can be actually used.

For the above purpose, China has evolved the Three Warfares. This has three elements. The first is the psychological campaign aimed at building the psychological pressure to scare, demoralise and deter its adversaries. The second is media warfare aimed at projecting that it is an injured nation to build international opinion in its favour and to ‚Äòexpose‚Äô the weaknesses of adversaries. This is also used for convincing its domestic audience of the righteousness of its stance. The main theme is project that it lost its territories to the forces of colonialism and imperialism and it must work to retrieve its lost territories and past greatness. This was projected as the ‚ÄòChinese dream‚Äô in 2014. The third is the fabricated legal arguments to justify its stand. The cartographic aggression forms an essential element of this process. The Three Warfares is based on use of its official media and exploitation of social media platforms. Its projections are based on disinformation and mendacity.

The aggressive behaviour is thus a function of its ‚Äòrise‚Äô and ‚Äòdream‚Äô aimed at changing the strategic environment in its favour in line with its expansionist policy. Since India has not been deterred by the use of means of Three Warfares, China has begun using other tactics to deter India. This suggests that China could launch an extensive cyber-attack and intrude at other points along the Sino-Indian border to deter India. To project its intentions of using force, the Chinese deployment of force may also be increased.

The problem is also partly domestic for China. Having raised the level of propaganda to this level Xi cannot withdraw without a loss of face. With Congress likely to meet in November, any withdrawal will project Xi in a weaker position. While second tern for him is not going to be a problem, the criticism against his policies is increasing. There are persons who think that Xi is incapable of handling the Chinese economic problems.

As far as India is concerned, it cannot accept unilateral changes at the border. The Chines arguments are hollow. China does not take into account the agreements reached in 1988 and 1998 with Bhutan and in 2012 with India. It also does not take into account that Bhutan was not a party to 1890 treaty. The Sikkim documents prove that the current position of tri-junction is in accordance with the treaty of 1890. China is also unhappy over India‚Äôs stand on the Belt Road Initiative and on the South China Sea. India has exposed the Chinese neo-colonial policy behind the Belt Road Initiative which has the objective of placing smaller nations into debt traps and controlling their policies to its advantage. India‚Äôs stand on the South China Sea is also being disliked by China. India has supported the implementation of the Permanent Court of Arbitration‚Äôs Ruling that has declared the Chinese claims of the region in the nine-dash lines as illegal, unacceptable and unjustified.

India‚Äôs calm reaction coupled with firmness at the Doklam is unnerving the Chinese authorities. As a reaction China has intensified its false propaganda. The more it indulges in falsehood the more it exposes its weaknesses in arguments. India without getting provoked has reflected that it is not going to be deterred by the escalation of level of deterrence by China.

The Chinese authorities should see that in the 21st Century it cannot deter nations like India. It should also realise that if India is further pushed, it can stop or reduce trade with China which will be disastrous for the latter. That would make Xi‚Äôs position very weak before the Congress meet of the Chinese Communist party. Xi should take advantage of India‚Äôs initiative to resolve the issue peacefully and through negotiations. Indian PM‚Äôs initiative to attend the BRICS meeting in the Chinese city of Xiamen ‚Äòin the interest of all nations‚Äô should be utilised by Xi to diffuse the tension at the border."

The Congress‚Äôs idea of India exposed,"Ashish Kulkarni, an aide to Rahul Gandhi and one of his election managers resigned recently. In his resignation letter, he cited the reasons: The Congress party was seen to be siding with the separatists in Jammu and Kashmir; the party was veering to the far left; it was also perceived to be anti-Hindu; the party catered to outright nepotism and was seen as elitist; finally, there was too much minority appeasement.

In a few short perceptive statements he managed to grasp what Lutyen‚Äôs Delhi has not been able to and why Digvijay Singh, Mani Shankar Aiyar and others of the Congress old guard are completely out of touch with India. It is not about nationalism or being Hindu, it is as Jay Panda, very rightfully pointed out at a roundtable discussion, that for decades India has not been governed according to our Constitution.

Every Indian under the constitution is considered equal. There must be a Uniform Civil Code for all Indians. These two mandated guarantees were largely ignored for vote banks and today, Indians are questioning it. That is why Triple Talaq, Love Jihad, Haj subsidies and other such issues are coming out in the open now. Muslim women themselves are demanding that the question of divorce cannot be left to arbitrary Mullahs, where men are allowed to abandon their wives at will. Why should a secular Republic be dictated by rules that are not only archaic but a form of appeasement to minorities?

India at 70 has to move on and by moving on we not only need to give opportunities to each and every young person but we also need to recognize the rights of women under a universal law.

For too long India has been living under the guise of a repressive tolerance. Left leaning socialism with its License Raj where companies could only produce so many cars or so many tons of steel led to massive corruption, high prices and a closed economy. It is a shame that we let go our basic manufacturing industries of electronics to China and helped them become a super power while our population remained poor, jobless and hungry.

It is horrendous that we let the separatists in Kashmir dictate to us how much money they wanted for peace in the valley all the while taking money from Pakistan for disturbing the peace. For decades, the central government was actually conniving, condoning and paying for terror in the valley along with, it seems, Pakistan! For years our police force and army sacrificed their lives for keeping the peace, while the local politicians in Kashmir and Hurriyat leaders were paid off to keep the valley simmering and the youth inflamed.

Recently, Zaroor Ahmed Watali a billionaire businessman, and close aide to Geelani, was found with secret diaries that revealed his ties with Pakistan‚Äôs ISI and funding to terrorists. The fact that since 1990 he has been using his businesses as a front for managing funds for the separatists for financing subversive activities in the valley and was arrested in 1990 and imprisoned but then let go, speaks volumes about politicians in Kashmir who grew rich on the blood of its people.

For 27 years Watali was allowed to finance terror in the valley and his businesses flourished in UAE , Europe, Mumbai and Kashmir thanks to political patronage and terror financing. The National Investigative Agency (NAI) is finally closing in on the separatists but we need to go after the politicians who allowed this kind of treason to flourish.

Ashish Kulkarni, has done us a big favour by pointing out that the Congress extended too many favours to the separatists. It is time we found out why?"

Speaking on the subject of Light Combat Aircraft Tejas, he clarified that the only the only drawback of LCA Tejas is that it's a light plane and can only accommodate payload up to 3.5 ton. Other than that, Tejas is one of the best airplanes in the world.

""It was completed some 5-6 years (ago) but the government was not inducing it. Minor issues were there. I consecutively conducted 18 meetings and saw to it that it is inducted in the Air Force...

Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‚Äònationalist‚Äô mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India‚Äôs ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism‚Äôs about freedom for the mind and democracy‚Äôs about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It‚Äôs time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar‚Äôs vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP‚Äôs madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don‚Äôt these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‚Äòsabka saath sabka vikas‚Äô in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‚Äògolf-playing Macaulayputra‚Äô, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities ‚Äì of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation ‚Äì feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn‚Äôt call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that‚Äôs why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler‚Äôs supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent‚Äôs ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That‚Äôs because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other‚Äôs shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It‚Äôs really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That‚Äôs why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament ‚Äì the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet ‚Äì the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism‚Äôs unobtrusive ‚Äòsoft power‚Äô, one that‚Äôs created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It‚Äôs time to change the goal of ‚ÄòHindu Rashtra‚Äô to the more inclusive ‚ÄòIndian Rashtra.‚Äô The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."

"Nice Move: BSF Adopts 'Wellness Quotient Assessment Test' To Curb Suicide, Depression In Jawans","The incident of a jawan posting a video of lack of amenities and bad quality of food given to them had gone viral, showing the miserable way of life they live in despite protecting the borders of the nation.

In order to address this issue, BSF Director General K K Sharma, in an interview to PTI, said he has initiated the projects with a concern to reduce such instances in the force on a priority basis.

In order to keep both - the jawans‚Äô mental and physical health in check, a ‚Äòwellness quotient assessment‚Äô test will be added in their annual medical check up. ""We are doing some new things now, so that there is an early identification of such personnel (who are in stress or in trouble) and such instances are reduced to the best extent possible,"" the BSF DG said.

The jawans, are deployed for long spans of time at inhospitable climate along the Indo-Pak and Indo-Bangla borders, where they are unable to meet or communicate with their families.

What we have launched recently is a 'wellness quotient assessment test', the DG said, adding it is a multi-point questionnaire which is being ""linked"" to the annual medical test of jawans and officers. Sharma, a 1982-batch IPS officer, said under this pilot project, troops will have to reply to a variety of questions relating to a various life situations, challenges and conditions and these questions have been prepared by expert mental counsellors and doctors.

The test is aimed to identify those troops who need help psychologically by counseling. The records have stated that while in 2014 there were 46 suicides in the BSF, these numbers reduced to 27 in 2015 and 24 in the last year.

Another pilot project launched in the BSF in this context is called the 'mentor-mentee' system.

""There are people who are natural counselors. We are identifying such troops in the force. Such personnel can be further groomed to act as counselors and experts who would identify a buddy in trouble, help him or her and seek help of superiors to bring comfort to them,"" he said.



In 90 per cent cases, the BSF boss said, the trooper came back from leave and in the next 10-15 days they took the drastic step. It has been found that the tension and stress which the victim had, was of domestic nature.

Home-grown Nationalism,"

Rabindra Sangeet exponent REBA SOM focuses on Sister Nivedita, her nationalism and patriotism in the wake of her 150th birth anniversary. ‚ÄúShe was an audacious woman who could hold her own,‚Äù she tells SONAL SRIVASTAVA





Margaret Elizabeth Noble aka Sister Nivedita set sail for India in 1898. Inspired by Swami Vivekananda ‚Äî who initiated her in brahmacharini vows ‚Äî Margot, as she was known to family and friends,made India her home. After her initiation,Swami Vivekananda called her ‚ÄòNivedita,‚Äô one who has dedicated her life to God.‚ÄúShe was a remarkable person.I don‚Äôt think we have focused enough on her,‚Äùsays Reba Som, historian and Rabindra Sangeet exponent, who has written a book titled Margot: Sister Nivedita Of Vivekananda. Her book explores the life and beliefs of Sister Nivedita,including her views on nationalism and patriotism. Som frames Sister Nivedita‚Äôs life in the context of the pristine master-disciple relationship that Nivedita shared with her master, Swami Vivekananda. Often through her writings,she would present her master‚Äôs views.Encouraged by him,she gave a lecture on Kali worship at Calcutta‚Äôs Albert Hall, at a time when idol worship was looked down upon by Calcutta‚Äôs elite.However,Margot was also a rebel but one who could hold her own among illustrious personalities of Calcutta such as Abanindranath Tagore,Jagadish Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore and even her own master, Swami Vivekananda.



Som says that it is important to focus on the brave, sincere, and committed woman,who was audacious enough to have left her home in England at a young age and come to India,especially, since 2017 happens to be Nivedita‚Äôs 150th birth anniversary. Nivedita did not come to India with the withdrawn air of a curious foreigner;she came committed to adopting and judging India from her own inherited civilisational values, and not from western norms.‚Äù Nivedita had compassion,tolerance and a sense of inclusiveness.This sense of inclusiveness was strengthened by her acceptance of the Vedantic paradigm of Universal Oneness. Nivedita embodies assimilation and all-inclusiveness in many ways.‚ÄúSwami Vivekananda had said that it‚Äôs not a question of tolerating other religions.The word toleration implies condescension. It‚Äôs a question of accepting them as Truth. You accept all religions as Truth,but you follow your own religion,‚Äù says Som, underlining it as a marvellous thought and stressing the need to accept other religions as Truth as one would perhaps accept his own. ‚ÄúNivedita talks a lot about Islam and Buddhism. Buddhism for both Swamiji and Nivedita was full of high ideals. Nivedita never lost her Christian faith; she may have been a Hindu in the larger sense,yet she celebrated Christmas.There was something catholic, in the sense of a wide-embracing concept that was there in her and her master,‚Äù elaborates Som pointing to the magnanimous nature of Swami Vivekananda and his disciples. Nivedita had very strong political views that were unsettling for some.



She would voice her opinion with aplomb thanks to her upbringing by her grandfather who was an active participant in the Irish Freedom movement.‚Äú She was a devoted disciple of Vivekananda; she also could not but be aware of the rumblings in the political life of the country at that time. Vivekananda did not want to be drawn into politics. He had his mission ‚Äî Ramakrishna Mission.He was on a man-making mission. Nivedita wanted to go a step further.When Vivekananda died, she was not totally lost. On the other hand, she was able to reinvent herself with a new purpose.And that purpose was nationalism. She had her own definition of nationalism. She did not see the nation as a western construct or as a homogeneous identity that people like Rabindranath Tagore had problems accepting.‚Äù ‚ÄúHer nationalism was home grown, drawing from the civilisational unity of the country, from the epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,both great cohesive factors in India‚Äôs identity,‚Äù explains Som,juxtaposing Nivedita‚Äôs sense of nationalism to the current nationalistic fervour. ‚ÄúPatriotism at that time had a different context; it was national struggle for freedom. But her concept of nationalism goes beyond;it‚Äôs about instilling pride in yourself, but not in a narrow- minded,sectarian way.Even Swami Vivekananda was a Vedantist, but if he felt the need to worship Kali, he did it.Vivekananda explained that it‚Äôs not a question of either/or; it can be both. Again,we come to this inclusiveness.‚Äù In The Web Of Indian Life,Nivedita forms ‚Äî from her extensive travels across the country ‚Äî her sympathy for the nationalist endeavours of young people. She was Irish; she became anti-British when she saw the racial prejudices of the government.



Som quotes Nivedita in her book:‚ÄúIndia must be observed by this great conception.Hindu and Mohammedan must become one in it with passionate admiration of each other. It means new views of history, of custom, and it means assimilation of the whole Ramakrishna- Vivekananda ideal in Religion ‚Äî the synthesis of all religious ideas. It means a final understanding of the fact that the political process and the economic disaster are only side-issues, that the one essential fact is realisation of her own Nationality by the Nation.‚Äù Nivedita followed tradition, but at the same time also pursued religious reform. In the school that she started for girls, she not only wanted to teach young girls, but also young widows.Som says that tradition is not always moribund, outdated, archaic and no longer valid. Vivekananda had also lashed out against ritual worship prevalent at that time.‚ÄúTradition as underlined in our concepts is something to treasure, but we have to move on.The entire cultural heritage belongs to us.For Nivedita, her heroes were Akbar as well as Ashoka, she also talked about Prithviraj. That is our strength. And because she comes from the west, she is able to relate and correlate. She would keep comparing civilisations.So it‚Äôs not about this and not that. It‚Äôs about inclusive Vedantic theory,‚Äù says Som. At the end of the book, Som translates from Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs Bangla obituary that he wrote when Nivedita died.‚ÄúOne had to respect her not because she was a Hindu,but because she was an outstanding human being.One had to salute her not for being like the rest of us, but for being better than us. She could claim pride from all not because of her Hindutva but because of her humanism.‚Äù

StarSewer Story: Death Of Sanitation Workers In Delhi Exposes The Hypocrisy & Failure Of Govt,"Every day hundreds of men descend into the putrid, foul smelling gutters of the national capital without any safety gear. The number is staggering for the rest of the country. Those who die during the duty are replaced by others, waiting to put their lives in danger just to earn a living for themselves and their families.

Every week young men line up for Rs 200 that they get to clean 20-25 gutters. They do this each day of a week, till they fall sick due to poisonous gasses in sewers or die of asphyxiation.

While sewage cleaning has become mechanised in some parts of the country, the government figures suggest nearly 8,00,000 people still work as sewage cleaners.

In Delhi, sewage travels across 5,600- kilometre long sewer lines at the speed of one metre per second. There are more than 1.5 lakh manholes for the effluents released by the Capital‚Äôs close to 19 million people.

Reports suggest that nearly 23,000 men and women die in India every year doing various kinds of sanitation work.

A research at Tata Institute of Social Sciences has found that 80% of the sewage cleaners die before age 60 because of work-related health problems. In Mumbai, an average of 20 sewer workers die each month from accidents, suffocation or exposure to toxic gases, the study found.

Recent spate of deaths in the capital

Rajesh, one of the survivors of the Lajpat Nagar sewage cleaning fiasco, which turned fatal for three, is left with severe injuries and is jobless for the last 10 days after he descended into a sewer and fell unconscious, only to be pulled up the last member after he stopped responding.

bccl

Hailing from Uttar Pradesh, he has a wife and an 18-year-old daughter to look after. Rajesh, with his family, is currently in hiding. He has been constantly receiving death threats from the members of his community who question his survival.

‚ÄúYou know our work is dirty. Filth and human excreta are obvious, sometimes we even come across dead animals like dogs, cats and rats. Broken bottles lurking in darkness mark our bodies with scars and cuts.‚Äù

The incident comes weeks after four sanitation workers died of asphyxiation while cleaning a septic tank in Ghitorni. Nine sanitation workers have died in Delhi in 2017, so far.

Toxic sewage gases claimed two more lives when two sanitation workers entered a septic tank without any safety gear at a mall in Anand Vihar on August 12.

Government & civic bodies in denial mode

In stark contrast to reports, Delhi Jal Board says that the task of sewage cleaning is completely mechanised and that manual scavenging has not been in practice for almost a decade now in the capital.

We have all the safety gear including gum boots, masks, jackets etc, for workers in case it is required‚Äù, says Ravikant, a Delhi Jal Board Employee in North Delhi, while pointing at some sticks and rods kept in a corner of an ill-kept office.

‚ÄúWe use only machines to do the cleaning. We do not allow men to enter the sewers‚Äù, he adds.

Delhi Commission for Safai Karamcharies, the top authority for the welfare of sanitation workers in Delhi, works towards the rehabilitation of such workers and addresses the issues affecting their socioeconomic and working conditions. The four municipal bodies in Delhi employs around 20,000 sanitation workers to keep the city clean.

On March 2014, a landmark ruling from the Supreme Court said sewer workers should also be included in laws abolishing manual scavenging as they have to handle human excreta under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions while cleaning sewer lines, often without any protective gear.

‚ÄúEmploying manual labour to clean sewage systems is a clear violation of the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling. It is extremely disheartening that in such modern times, everyday cases of deaths of sanitation workers are reported. We have sent a consolidated report about the recent deaths to the government requesting them to start an awareness camp against such practices,‚Äù said Sant Lal Chawariya, Chairman, Delhi Commission for Safai Karamcharies.

‚ÄúWhile we know that manual scavenging has been abolished the by the law, there is no question of providing safety gear to men. Why are we still talking about safety equipment when manual scavenging has been abolished? We demand provision for punishment of employers who employee manual scavengers. As soon as a sanitation worker is employed to clean a sewer, the law is violated their itself,‚Äù he added.

The compensation to family members of the deceased as fixed by the apex court is Rs 10 lakh. Without protests and waiting for months, the family members do not receive a single penny.

""Swachh Bharat a failure""

The authorities say they are working towards the rehabilitation of such workers providing them better jobs like giving auto and taxi permits and assisting their children to get admission in schools for better education opportunities. However, much remains only on paper and is used to make hollow promises. Rehabilitation seems to be a distant dream for sanitation workers.

Bezwada Wilson, founder of Safai Karamchari Andolan and a recipient of Ramon Magsaysay Award, says: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the government always goes into a mode of denial and believe it is not necessary to hear to the grievances of the sanitation workers. In March 2014, the Supreme Court directed the government to compile a list of deceased manual scavengers from 1993 and work towards the rehabilitation of their families. Till date, there has been zero effort from the government in this direction.‚Äù

bccl

Wilson believes the major issue with the government is that it does not consider organisations working towards the welfare of sanitation workers as a collective entity. Instead, it sees such bodies as a threat working against the government.

Criticising the Swachh Bharat Mission without mincing any words, Wilson says the pilot project of the Prime Minister of India has done nothing towards the welfare of sanitation workers. ‚ÄúConstructing new toilets without dismantling dry toilets is a directionless effort. The government is silent on this issue and is only highlighting the goal to construct 21 crore new toilets in the country. Swachh Bharat is about business. It is merely a corporate programme,‚Äù he adds.

More than 95 per cent of sewer workers are from India‚Äôs lowest social class, the Dalits, once known as ‚Äúuntouchables‚Äù. The job still exists because of the widespread apathy towards the Dalits, who form the most deprived community in the country despite efforts to end caste-based discrimination.

The government has failed to enforce The Employment of Manual Scavenging and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 2013, that made it illegal to employ manual scavengers. However, the law in itself is contradictory because it also outlines tests that must be conducted before a worker enters a sewer. It is a clear indication that the government itself cannot outlaw a job that employs a certain community, who would otherwise lack alternative work.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared the eradication of manual scavenging by 2019, the ground reality is starkly contrasting and chances of the fulfilment of the PM‚Äôs promise look grim."
Samsung May Launch The 1st Smartphone In The World That Could Tell You If You're Drunk!,"What if your smartphone could accurately tell you how drunk you were? Only a little drunk, well below the legal driving limit, or smash drunk, where the tiniest movement could result in your face meeting the floor?

REUTERS

Samsung may well be on its way to putting anxious drivers out of their misery, when they stop at the watering hole before driving back home on a weeknight.

Samsung has already launched the Galaxy S8, and it's due to launch the Galaxy Note 8 before the end of the year. While the former sported one of the best displays ever seen on smartphones, the latter could feature the world's first stylus with a built-in breathalyzer which is able to accurately determine the user's blood alcohol levels.

""Samsung filed a patent application for the S Pen that can measure the user's blood alcohol content in June 2016. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office approved it last month,"" according to a Korea Times report quoting a Samsung official. S Pen is the stylus that comes with Samsung's Galaxy Note series of devices.

Reuters

According to the patent, the S Pen doubles up as a breathalyzer and microphone, and when a user holds it in their hand a small part of S Pen bends almost 90 degrees, exposing a couple of sensors inside the tool to measure the alcohol level in the blood, all while the user is busy talking on the phone.

It is still not certain whether this breathalyzer S Pen will debut with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, scheduled to launch later this year. It's unusual for patents to be implemented immediately before extensive testing, but after the Galaxy Note 7 debacle last year, something tells us that Samsung will leave no stone unturned to ensure the Galaxy Note 8 is a smash hit.

Cheers to that, eh?"
"A Village In Andhra Pradesh Is Striving To Achieve 100% Sanitation In 1,000 Days","It takes a foreign trip for an Indian to realise the kind of filth and litter we have on our roads. It almost feels like we pay thousands and lakhs just to be in cleaner place, considering that India is as beautiful as any other country out there- we have mountains, rivers, cascading waterfalls, pristine beaches and everything sans cleanliness.

dna/ A Picture Of Versova Beach After The Clean Drive

This social awakening about keeping surroundings clean came to India 3 years ago, with Modi's promising and aspiring 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'.

Around this time, public anguish turned into several private projects governed by individuals, institutes, committees, groups of people and sometimes an entire village.

One such village is Challapalli village in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, that began a campaign titled, ‚ÄòSwachh Challapalli‚Äô.

swachhindia

The campaign aims to achieve at 100 per cent sanitation and cleanliness within 1000 days, August 7 being the 1000th day. Today, on June 29, it is the 961st day and the village is almost nearing its target.

This initiative was a brainchild of Katta Padmavathi, Sarpanch of Challapalli village, who also collaborated with Manakosam Manam Trust (MMT) for the complete eradication the atrocities of waste management, cleanliness levels, open defecation and waste segregation.

swachhindia

The village is now going under a massive behavioural change, where they take care of their own belongings and vicinity. They've also set up underground drainage systems and composting unit to fight it thoroughly.

swachhindia

Out of 4850 households, nearly 520 didn‚Äôt own a toilet, but during this drive, 520 new toilets were built. Other than that, the village is already bearing the responsibility of building public toilets, individual septic latrines, a well-connected sewage system, and drains.

‚ÄúThere were awareness campaigns led by the panchayat committee in collaboration with the foundation to educate people about waste segregation. Within a few months, every household of Challapalli started to separate dry and wet waste,‚Äù said Mr Bollineni, added Prasad Bollineni, Panchayat Secretary.

The initiative has inspired a lot of nearby villages and has subsequently contributed in building awareness about a healthy surrounding."

He dismissed Kusal Mendis, Lakshan Sandakan and Wanindu Hasaranga. The best part about his spell was the economy rate, which was 3.40. Sri Lanka were dismissed for 216 within 44 overs."
Public investment trade-offs: The long and short of it,"Public investment becomes the default option when the economic commentariat suggests a solution to combat a phase charaterized by a slowdown in investment. India is no exception to this phenomenon and there are periodic calls to enhance public investment to deal with India‚Äôs current spell of weak private investment.

Public investment, however, involves a tough trade-off. Should more money be spent on expanding a country‚Äôs stock of physical infrastructure such as roads, or should the quality of human capital be enhanced through larger outlays in education?

Four economists, Manoj Atolia, Bin Grace Li, Ricardo Marto and Giovanni Melina, recently examined this question. Their research address a couple of important questions.

# Why is public spending on social infrastructure not higher in developing countries?

# What determines the composition of public infrastructure investment?

Their conclusions are that increasing spending on physical infrastructure has a quicker impact on economic performance; enhancing the quality of social infrastructure through spending on education improves workers‚Äô productivity in the long-run; and social infrastructure investment needs larger current spending on maintenance.

In short, the trade-off which faces policy makers is to choose between putting money where the immediate returns are higher or one where the long-run benefits are more meaningful.

For a politician who has to face voters at relatively short intervals, there is strong incentive to choose an option which promises immediate returns.

In India, the organization of governmental responsibilities means that chief ministers often have a tougher job in this matter. State governments have a larger say in investing in both education and roads.

Even if a chief minister is inclined to allocate more resources on education, the need to get re-elected is likely to get in the way. This is because popular discourse judges chief ministers through a ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù prism. Enhancing social infrastructure is also a part of development, but one where the benefits show up after a generation.

Therefore, in the emphasis to show results in a short time-frame, governments will almost always push resources into building physical infrastructure at the cost of social infrastructure."
"‚ÄòLook, I‚Äôm so secular!‚Äô The rise of virtue signallers on social media","The rise of social media in the past few years has meant that a lot of public opinion is debated, discussed and shaped on forums like Twitter and Facebook, and even thousands of local WhatsApp groups. One would imagine these powerful tools that connect millions can enable us to distill the best opinions on an issue, which can then shape our response to them.

However, there is a huge problem. These discussion forums are public. And in public, a lot of people are fake. They want to be seen as good, proper, balanced, modern and progressive. Most of all, they want to be seen as virtuous. If I can come across as a person who has these wonderful qualities to my 200-odd Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp friends, it is more valuable than actually saying what I feel on the issue.

In this context, a term called ‚Äòvirtue signalling‚Äô has become popular on the internet recently, although it was used in a few articles several years ago. But it is only now that you see virtue signalling on full display.

Try this. Mention that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel safe sending my parents on Amarnath Yatra after Muslim terrorists killed Hindu pilgrims.‚Äù Chances are several people out there will scream ‚Äòcommunal! communal!‚Äô to your statement before you even understand what on earth happened.

You see, these people have to show that they are so virtuous, so noble, and so good that they sense something is communal even when others don‚Äôt. Of course, there is nothing wrong in your original statement, as you are stating a fear based on an incident that has occurred.

However, the virtuous lot on the internet will demand that a) you don‚Äôt mention any religion at all ever, b) as Hindus are in majority, we must never raise an issue that affects Hindus because that makes us majoritarians and c) a truly virtuous person will not see this as an act against Hindus, but merely some bad people trying to hurt some good people and that is all that needs to be mentioned.

Of course, that is not how the human mind works or thinks. The fact remains that many Hindus will now think twice about sending their elderly parents to pilgrimage sites, particularly in Kashmir. However unsavoury, this needs to be discussed. How can we have a country where the majority of people feel unsafe about going to their places of worship? Is it communal to discuss this issue and come up with solutions?

According to the virtue signallers, it is. Your mentioning the word Hindu, let alone an issue that affects only Hindus, will brand you as communal. This is because by doing so, they come across as virtuous. When they attack you in anger, they are saying, ‚ÄòLook, I am such a secular person that the mere mention of the word Hindu makes me mad. Look, I am so good and secular that any hint of a Hindu issue makes me seethe with anger. And now that I have shown I am more virtuous, I have the right to attack the others. My goodness gives me sanction to abuse, insult and be rude to anyone else who isn‚Äôt that virtuous.‚Äô

We sometimes mistakenly refer to these people in India as fake-liberals, pseudo-seculars or elitists. All they are doing is virtue signalling, showing how modern and progressive they are ‚Äî so they look good to their virtual peers.

Hence, take a statement like, ‚ÄúAlthough we must have laws to protect women, some men are suffering due to fake domestic violence or fake harassment cases because some people are abusing the laws (something any lawyer or policeman dealing in such cases will attest).‚Äù Virtue signallers will jump on this and feast all day, calling it ‚Äòsexist, anti-women, backward or whatever else‚Äô because when you say that, you show that you are so equality-conscious.

Virtue signallers operate in many other arenas. They show their support for women‚Äôs cricket in their social feeds (though chances are they have never watched a women‚Äôs cricket match on TV in their lives).

Virtue signallers want to promote independent cinema over commercial cinema (though they don‚Äôt go and watch independent cinema in theatres). Virtue signallers want to show that they care about Dalits and Muslims, not because they actually care about Dalits and Muslims or do anything about it, but because stating so makes you look good on social media.

Beware of such utterly fake people, and avoid engaging in debate with them. They will tire and bore you to death with statements that don‚Äôt answer the issue at hand, but merely make them look good.

Virtue signalling is a reality of today‚Äôs social media. Because whenever we feel judged by a lot of people, we hide our true self and try to look good. It‚Äôs noise on the internet and, like trolls, must be ignored. We must debate issues by saying things as they are, for only then can a solution be found."

Seventy Years Of Freedom?,"Jesus taught that true freedom is to experience mukti within, writes DANIEL THEJUS





The idea of freedom resonates with the idea of release ‚Äî to be free. It has been 70 years since India became independent.The shackles of the British Raj fell.We have achieved release in one very important sense. However, have we experienced release internally? We are tangled by several pressures. The pressure at work to prove yourself. The pressure to live up to your neighbour‚Äôs standards. Somehow ‚Äòcomfort zone‚Äô has become a bad thing. In other words, we are all seeking happiness by running away from it the moment we find it. Dissatisfaction, the enemy of contentment, thrusts us further into this quagmire. This bondage that we experience excuses us of all our real responsibilities and somehow justifies a life lived purely for ourselves. In the midst of all this pressure, we have forgotten our dharma. We have forgotten our responsibility to family, society and in turn to ourselves.When everyone begins to forget their duty to one another,we end up living in a fractured world. Submersed in a world that is fractured, we do not know any better. Nevertheless, we realise something is amiss and we seek freedom.There is an unseen pull towards release from this selfish monotony. Now,instead of looking for release at the end of our life‚Äôs journey, it is possible to experience it within the monotonous struggles of daily life. Jesus offers us a solution he says we can experience in the here and now.We can experience death and rebirth every day. This experience of death and rebirth in the here and now purifies us and eventually releases us into eternity.



He says,‚Äòuntil a seed falls into the ground and dies it will never live again.‚Äô Jesus invites us into him to experience death, rebirth and release within our lifetime. We can enjoy rest in the present moment.And living every moment restfully is to live eternally. The logic that Jesus is propounding is practical. His invitation should not strike us as strange, we see it happening all the time in the plant world. He is now asking us to experience what Mother Nature knows all too well.Like a plant we have to die in order that we might live again.If we refuse to die, we will remain dead. If we accept this death,we will live again. If the seed is the ‚ÄòI‚Äô,the soil into which it is buried is God ‚Äî the ultimate reality.When the self is buried in the divine; divinity surrounds it,nurtures it and nourishes it.What sprouts out is a renewed life with new motivations,new possibilities and a spark of divinity reignited in us.The first attempt of this process might be the hardest but consecutive procedures will be motivated by the positive love that we experienced with the divine. This experience sets us free.We will experience mukti internally and to offer this to others becomes our dharma.This experience of freedom makes us: Responsible citizens of this world;love our neighbour and enemy as ourselves,renders every moment as joy despite unhappy circumstances; brings the Divine closer than we expected ‚Äî into us.‚ñ†

"For Digital India to really reap benefits, some key technology-related issues need to be resolved","By Kala S Sridhar & V Sridhar

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has argued for making the country digital, and paved the way for electronic payments and receipts through applications such as the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and online wallets. GoI intends to offer higher cashbacks if digital modes of payment are adopted. This has the potential to make India a country with low degree of corruption and black money, given that all transactions will be accounted for.

But there‚Äôs a flip side. Psychologically, cash brings with it responsibility. By extension, cashless transactions imply irresponsibility. When we swipe a debit or credit card, it doesn‚Äôt really pinch. But when we pay for something in cash, it makes us think several times, since we need to go to the ATM or bank regularly to get cash. So, what are the disadvantages of ‚Äòdigital‚Äô spending? At the macro level, saving takes a hit, and the economy may be deprived of much-needed investment and capital accumulation in infrastructure and in other sectors required to boost the rate of economic growth.

At the micro level, the spending spree enabled by cashless transactions will imply less liquidity, and less saving for future generations. According to the Institute of Management Development‚Äôs World Competitiveness Centre, tech-savvy countries most digitally ready are Singapore, Sweden, the US, Finland and Denmark. The scores are based on the country‚Äôs ability to adopt digital technologies, leading to changes in government practices, business approaches and society in general. India is ranked 51st here. While the average domestic savings rate in the most tech-savvy countries is at 29%, and only at 15% in the least techsavvy ones, the future trajectory of the ‚Äòsavings and digital‚Äô relationship is clear.

India‚Äôs domestic savings rate for 2015, according to the World Bank, is 31%, much higher than that of tech-savvy and digital Finland (21%), and of the US (17%) in 2015.

Further, Brazil and South Africa with higher digitisation are at only 16% and 20% domestic savings rate respectively, lending credence to the inverse relationship between digital payments and savings.

Don‚Äôt Have Right Connection

Also, is India prepared for digital transactions? This is a country with low information and communication technology (ICT) penetration. ‚ÄòThere is a problem with the system‚Äô, ‚Äòservers are slow‚Äô or ‚ÄòOTP is not sent‚Äô are constant refrains.

Digital payments require the user to be internet- and mobile-savvy. One has to remember at least two factors of authentication before completing each transaction. The two-factor authentication, while improving security, is not very user-friendly and, in most cases, depends on the telecommunication infrastructure.

According to the World Economic Forum Global Information Technology Report 2016, India is ranked 114 (out of 139 countries) in network infrastructure sub-index. The recent State of the Internet Connectivity 2017 by Akamai Technologies indicates that India is ranked 89th in internet connection speed. The poor broadband infrastructure and associated quality of services affect the timely and successful completion of electronic transactions.

Further, the digitally illiterate depend on middlemen to perform their digital transactions. As old habits die hard, the middlemen, now armed with technological skills, extract rent from the user. These tech-savvy middlemen have access to the passwords and account details of their customers, and, hence, can do irreparable financial damages and invade consumer‚Äôs financial privacy.

The accountability and liability of the different service providers ‚Äî such as the telecom operators, payment gateway providers and app providers ‚Äî in case the digital transactions fail, are not specified in any regulation. In most cases, it is left to the poor user/consumer to fight it out. Most often, the blame game on each other leaves the customer empty handed and with his or her financial privacy at risk.

It may well be the case that cash or digital payments do not really determine the degree, and pace, of consumer spending. But this much is for sure: if we accept rational human behaviour, digital payments are needed in an era of slow growth, when effortless consumer spending is needed for pump-priming the economy.

On the other hand, when the economy is inflationary, it is preferable that cash transactions are made, enabling consumer restraint. The promise of cashback for a digital payment is counterproductive.

A Tech-tonic Shift

In the interests of freeing the country of corruption that it promises, digital payments should be encouraged, understanding their effects on consumer spending. After all, as a country‚Äôs income keeps increasing, it will become more, not less, technologically advanced.

Hence, to facilitate digital transactions, regulations should be formulated regarding the onus and liability of different players in the digital economy, such that consumer interests are protected.

I've been Vineet Anantharaman snoozing off in the esteemed company of Sagar Chawla, Abhishek Chaudhary, Ramakrishnan, Sriram and Naga. Ta ta!!

Stat highlights:

- 197* - Highest 2nd wicket stand for Ind in SL. Previous: 188 by Dhoni - Gambhir, RPS, 2009.

- Fewest overs to chase down 200+ target (full 50 overs ODIs):

26.0 Aus v Ban, Dhaka, 2011

26.2 Pak v Ind, Lahore, 1997

28.5 Ind v SL, Dambulla, 2017

- 132* by Dhawan is the highest by an Indian in a run chase in ODIs in SL

Previous: 128* by Kohli vs SL, RPS, 2012

---------------------------------

Virat Kohli (2/2): ""I feel we need to start planning for the 2019 World Cup around 24 months in advance, try to experiment a bit here and there. We are taking that as a challenge and are looking to try out different things, things we wouldn't do usually. You can see a lot of surprises over the next few games. All the guys have bought into it and I am very excited. We thought Axar was a gun fielder and he brings his batting into play; and felt that one wrist spinner is enough. Also, Axar is a power-hitting batsman capable of hitting the big shots and that helps us. If we get a dry wicket we could go in with three spinners and a fast bowling all-rounder. At the start of a series we need to up our batting and Axar brings that balance for us as a team.""

Virat Kohli (1/2): ""They got off to a very good start. We thought we'd be chasing something close to 300; it was a brilliant wicket for batting. The whole idea of winning the toss and bowling first was hoping that the wicket would be slightly slow in the day. The ball was coming onto the bat like a dream under lights and Shikhar and me enjoyed batting together. At 129/1 we had a few things to think about but the bowlers came back superbly. The last three months have been a great time for Shikhar. The good thing is that he is capitalizing on his purple patch. He can win you games with the way he bats and we would be looking to keep him in that zone for as long as we can. He is feeling good about his game and is hitting the ball well. When he plays like this he is a match-winner and even in Tests he can win you games with the bat."""

Stats: India's towering presence against out-of-form Sri Lanka

Deepu Narayanan ‚Ä¢ Last updated on Sat, 19 Aug, 2017, 12:15 PM

Shikhar Dhawan averages 69.44 with two hundreds and four fifties against Sri Lanka. ¬© Getty

The league stage encounter between India and Sri Lanka at the Kennington Oval in the recently concluded Champions Trophy had a special significance attached to it - India and Sri Lanka became the first sides to play against each other in 150 ODIs. Such has been the profusion of India-Sri Lanka ODIs since the 2000s - 88 of them - that at one point in Virat Kohli's career, more than half of his games were against the island nation.

Though the two sides have locked horns more than any other sides in the recent past, the contests on the field haven't lived up to the expectations. While Sri Lanka have a slight edge over India in the multi-nation tournaments, it has been a one-way traffic in the bilateral meets. Consider this stat - the last time Sri Lanka won a bilateral ODI series against India (3-0 at home in 1997), Mahela Jayawardene was yet to make his ODI debut (he finished with 448 ODI caps, second most by any player in history).

India - SL ODIs post 2000

Period ODIs Ind Won SL Won Tie/NR Ind Win % SL Win % All ODIs 88 49 32 7 55.68% 36.36% In Sri Lanka 35 17 15 3 48.57% 42.86% Bilateral series 37 27 7 3 72.97% 18.92% Multi-nation series 51 22 25 4 43.14% 49.02%

India won seven out of the eight bilateral rubbers against Sri Lanka post-2005 with the other one ending in a 0-0 draw with rain playing spoilsport. Not only have they won the series, India's domination in this period has been so overriding that Sri Lanka have won more than one match in a series, only once (win margins for India being 6-1, 2-1, 3-2, 4-1, 3-1, 4-1 and 5-0). Things haven't been that different in Sri Lanka as well, as India's win-loss record of 11-4 in Sri Lanka in the last ten years indicate the same.

Sri Lanka average over 47 with the ball against India in bilateral ODIs, nearly 19 points higher than what they average with the willow against them. The difference of 18.85 between Sri Lanka's bowling and batting average is the second highest in bilateral series among top eight teams since 2005. The only higher difference in bilateral ODIs is the one between South Africa and West Indies - 30.71. The next worst for Sri Lanka against an opposition is 13.82, against South Africa (batting average 27.76 and bowling average 41.58).

Out of the 16 times in the 37 ODIs India batted first, eight times they crossed 300. Spin bowling, considered the backbone of the Sri Lankan bowling attack over the years and the way Indian batsmen subjugated them, dictated the results in India's favour. Barring Ajantha Mendis who weaved a web over the Indian batsmen when he initially burst onto the scene, no other Sri Lankan spinner averaged less than 35 against India - the great Muttiah Muralitharan averaged 35 in bilateral ODIs against the familiar foes.

Lasith Malinga is all set to play his 200th ODI and he is just two scalps away from the 300-wicket mark. However, the problem for the hosts is the inexperience of the other bowlers in the squad - all the 14 have a combined 291 ODI wickets, seven less than Malinga's individual tally. Angelo Mathews and Thisara Perera have contributed 240 of those and it's a welcome news for Sri Lanka that he will bowl in this series.

The challenge for Malinga will be that he will be up against the two batsmen who have dominated him the most in limited-overs cricket - Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. Kohli has scored 180 off 169 balls off him, getting dismissed just once, while Dhoni has 186 off 167 deliveries against three dismissals. As a result, Malinga's overall ODI numbers against India are few notches below his overall numbers - averages 41.92 against India in comparison to 28.39 in his career.

Apart from Kohli and Dhoni who average 54.59 and 61.40 against Sri Lanka, Shikhar Dhawan has been another thorn in the eye for them. In nine innings against Sri Lanka, he averages 69.44 with two hundreds and four fifties including a 125 which came during their recent Champions Trophy clash. Angelo Mathews is one Sri Lankan batsman who has done remarkably well against India, scoring 935 runs from 28 innings at 46.75 and a strike rate in excess of 90. However, their skipper Upul Tharanga averages only 29.62 against India.

Sri Lanka have won only one out of the nine bilateral series against Full Member sides since the start of 2015 - against a weak West Indies side at home in 2015. The nine rubbers include a series loss to Zimbabwe and a shared trophy against Bangladesh - two oppositions Sri Lanka used to steamroll on their heydays from the past. With at least two wins needed to secure a direct qualification for the 2019 World Cup, Sri Lanka will have their task cut out against their bogey opposition from the recent past.

Falling in love once again at Kolkata‚Äôs Anadi Cabin,"I left Kolkata for Mumbai a couple of decades back. I keep going back to Kolkata when I can. My family is there after all. Most of my meals there are with family and friends, the most special of those are with my grandmother and my mother. I do eat out in Kolkata when I can but my choices are driven by nostalgia more than anything else.

When in Kolkata, I want my phuchka, chop, cutlet, roll, biryani, luchi and mangsho. I couldn‚Äôt care less about the new Italian or Vietnamese restaurant which might have opened in the city. There is enough time for those when I am away. In Kolkata, it would be the Shiraz‚Äôs and the Nizam‚Äôs, the Flurys and the Kookie Jars, the Bhojohori Mannas and 6 Ballygunge Places that I would go to chasing old memories.

These days I also try to visit some of the classic restaurants from central and north Kolkata. Places I might not have visited when I lived in Kolkata as I was a south Kolkata boy then. In the pre-Metro era, there was a Game of Thrones like north-south divide in Kolkata after all. I am talking of the cabin restaurants, the sweet shops, the dishevelled remnants of the old China towns, places which paint a picture of Kolkata to me which is so adventurous and so unique, so full of colour and character and above all, memories.

Places tourists and emigrants like to go back to even if those who stay in the city, understandably, seek new experiences.

Let‚Äôs take Anadi Cabin, for example, which I visited during my most recent visit to the city.

Anadi Cabin is a Kolkata institution. Its name is synonymous with Moghlai parathas, a dish which despite its majestic name harking back to the Mughals, is something that you get across the humblest of eateries across the city.

Anadi Cabin is located at S N Banerjee Road near Espalande. Today it is a bit of an urban legend. With the city expanding, and Esplanade not being as central as it once was, places like Anadi are not as frequented by people from across the city. Everyone knows that it exists but if you ask them how the food there is, reactions will vary from ‚Äòit is overrated‚Äô to ‚Äòthe quality is not the same.‚Äô Two comments that iconic eateries across India are often subjected to not matter how packed they are with customers. The third epitaph would be, ‚Äòits too touristy!‚Äô

Whether its Paradise in Hyderabad (justifiably I might add), Karims in Delhi, Tunday in Lucknow or Britannia in Mumbai (again justifiably perhaps), they would all be subject to one or all of these judgements by locals.

At times it is good to just go by yourself and try out these places in any case. You might actually discover what made them so special. If you are lucky, you will find that they still are.

I was quite excited about my visit to Anadi. I had gone there a couple of decades back but in those days I would just go to a restaurant to fill my stomach. I would not go looking for a ‚Äòstory‚Äô. I‚Äôd been wanting to go there for a while but hadn‚Äôt been able to in recent trips. This time I managed to convince a couple of friends to join me to Anadi after we had eaten a sumptuous breakfast at Flurys, again on my request.

It was close to 2 pm when we reached. The atmosphere inside the small restaurant seemed quite sleepy . The tables inside looked unoccupied. We were the first customers of the day it seemed. The staff at Anadi were divided in their opinion on whether we should be allowed to sit in or whether we should wait. The mood seemed to be, ‚Äúcan we chill a little bit more before the day starts?‚Äù.

We were eventually seated after a number of intense parleys among the staff. The place got packed in a matter of minutes. Ten minutes later and we would have had to queue up. I saw the rush and realised why the staff wanted to make the most of the lull before the start. They would, after all, be on their feet till night after that.

The seating at Anadi is spartan. There is no air-conditioning, toilets or wifi here. This is a world far removed from the GST and service charge imposing modern cafes, bistros and resto-bars that define new India.

As it is in such eateries across India, you are expected to share tables with strangers if alone at Anadi Cabin. The restaurant seemed fairly clean when I was there. The jury is divided on whether it is always so according to comments that I received on social media.

Though the restaurant is called a ‚Äòcabin‚Äô, the waiter told me that this 98-year-old (according to him) restaurant didn‚Äôt actually have cabins in the past. ‚ÄòCabin‚Äô refer to partitions made for families to sit in privacy in restaurants during more conservative times in Kolkata. These were later havens for courting couples. Places which had such cabins have done away with them today. Whispering sweet nothings over a shared ‚Äòcold drinks (sic)‚Äô is not good for business and who has the time and place for romance anymore in any case?

There is a counter at the front of the restaurant where they fry the parathas that make the restaurant famous. This dates from a time when ‚Äòopen kitchens‚Äô were yet to be trendy.

The tables by which you rest your weary bodies and wait for the parathas, have marble tops. The plates on which the food is served are of white bone china. The restaurant has the sort of ‚Äòdistressed‚Äô look that new restaurants in Mumbai pay designers big money to recreate these days.

We had the duck egg (hasher deem) Moghlai paratha which Anadi is famous for. The paratha was served with the traditional, lightly spiced, cubed potato curry and ketchup. There was the mandatory ‚Äòsalad‚Äô, sliced cucumber, carrot and onion.

Was the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi over-rated and not a patch on what it was?

To be honest, I don‚Äôt know. My memories of the past are hazy when it comes to Aanadi. I haven‚Äôt had a wide enough variety of Moghlai parathas in Kolkata in the recent past and am not equipped to do a comparative analysis.

What I can tell you with surety is that I quite enjoyed the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi and that it made me fall in love with the treasured treat of my childhood days. The parathas was very well balanced in terms of flavour and had a lovely texture ‚Äì neither too crisp, nor dense or chewy.

What is a Moghlai paratha you ask?

A Moghlai paratha is a paratha made with maida or refined flour. The flattened dough is stuffed with crushed peanuts, raisins, finely chopped carrots (at Anadi at least) and green chilies, all whisked into freshly cracked eggs. The dough, with the stuffing enveloped inside, is then shallow fried in dalda on a tava and served hot. I doubt if it will taste too good if reheated for having later.

The paratha at Anadi didn‚Äôt have any meat in it as far as I could see. I do have memories of having eaten Moghlai parathas with a sprinkling of minced meat in them as a kid.

The other childhood memory that I have of Moghlai parathas is that the adults accompanying one during a Moghlai paratha treat would cut the parathas into cubes so that us kids could eat them easily with a fork. This time my mother or my grandfather or my mama or my mashis, who used to take me out then weren‚Äôt around so I had to cut the paratha into bite sized cubes myself.

The Moghlai paratha of Kolkata is a cousin of the martabak of Penang, matabaq of the middle east, the palata (sic) of Myanmar and the baida roti of Mumbai. The base concept for each is similar though the versions differ in terms of thickness, size, stuffing and levels of crunchiness.

My friend, Kaniska who accompanied me for the outing and who often visits Dhaka for work, told me that the Moghlai parathas are made crunchier in Dhaka where it is a streetfood dish unlike in Kolkata where it is a part of cabin fare. One theory says that Moghlai Paratha of Kolkata came to the city from Dhaka but in a country with little written food history, these theories are a bit inconclusive.

Having tried versions of the paratha across the sub-continent (barring in Myanmar) I would say that the Moghlai paratha of Anadi did Kolkata proud.

Aanadi is not a one dish restaurant though. The revelation of the afternoon at Anadi in fact was the kosha mangsho. This is a classic Bengali slow cooked semi-dry goat meat preparation which has mustard oil, onions and garam masala as its base. Like many dishes in the east, the Odiyas, the Biharis and the Assamese make versions of it too.

We ordered a plate of kosha mangsho with plain parathas at Aanadi for Kaniska‚Äôs wife, Manishita, who didn‚Äôt want eggs. The number of pieces of mutton (goat meat) in the serving was ample. The meat was well cooked and not a single piece was tough or chewy unlike what I have seen in some Bengali restaurants that offer this dish. Some bits of the meat had delightful nibbles of chorbi, the forbidden fat, hidden in them. The thick curry which was wrapped around the meat had a deep and near mystic touch to it which had the three of us in its spell. It was not too high on chilli heat or oil and yet promised an experience that smacked of pomp and majesty. This was definitely one of the best kosha mangshos that I have eaten in restaurants and I have had quite a few for sure!

Close to a century of practise and passion showed in what we ate at Anadi you could say and the service was lovely too. My submission is to visit places like Anadi when you visit Kolkata. In a city that loves food, you are rarely going to go wrong."
Narendra Modi‚Äôs Independence Day speech: farmers still waiting for achhe din,"Listening to Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs speech on Independence Day when he spoke at length about welfare of farmers gave one a feeling of d√©j√† vu. It was almost as if one was transported to early 2014 when the Lok Sabha election campaign was in full swing. During that entire campaign, Modi had made it a point to reiterate his commitment towards welfare of farmers. Three years later Modi has ushered GST and demonetisation which has changed the basic fundamentals of Indian economy, but his government‚Äôs apathy towards agriculture which constitute 54.6% of India‚Äôs total work force remains unchanged.

Consider the speeches before Modi became Prime Minister in which he promised that farmers would make a minimum of 50% profit on their produce. He assured farmers that after taking into account their input cost of seed, water, electricity, fertilizer, medicines, and labour etc., the new dispensation would add a flat 50% over and above it to decide the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of crops. Three years later farmer unrest continues in large parts of the country forcing some state governments to intervene and offer loan-waivers.

The farmers need our support. They have been benefited by the various schemes launched by the government: PM Modihttps://t.co/EJUKnzWeiE pic.twitter.com/jff0gHrlLg ‚Äî Times of India (@timesofindia) August 15, 2017

In his speech from Red Fort, Modi went on to list his government‚Äôs achievements of how the number of farmers covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has gone up from 3.25 crore to 5.75 crore. Even though Modi‚Äôs intentions may be to ensure that farmers are covered under some sort of financial security, but it is an uphill task for farmers to avail benefits due to many technicalities of PMFBY rules. This is directly proportionate to the growth of non-life general insurance companies at the expense of farmers. These companies grew at 32% from Rs 96,376 crore in 2015‚Äì16 to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in 2016‚Äì17 as per reports.

Rural distress is evident in the significantly high figure of 6867 farm suicides mainly from five states in 2016 as per reports. Comparatively, this is more than half of total figures from five states in 2015 when farmers faced severe drought for the second consecutive year. Even though government has claimed that farmer suicides are declining, the number of reported suicide cases has belied their claim. Modi too has shifted goal posts by promising to double farm income by 2022 ‚Äì a promise prominently mentioned in BJP‚Äôs 2014 manifesto."
"India@70: Reshaping diets, speeches and even our thoughts","Let‚Äôs start with what happened at a madrassa on Independence Day this year. Little boys and girls, neatly dressed and holding paper flags, were seated on a dhurrie, when a reporter strolled in. Mistaking the journalist for a government officer, sent to ‚Äòcheck‚Äô and report to headquarters, the madrassa teacher hastily assured the hack everything was on track. ‚ÄúThe children have just finished singing the national anthem‚Ä¶but they will sing it again for you if you want, sir.‚Äù What a telling moment! Doesn‚Äôt that innocent reaction say everything? To me, this incident was far more revealing of the sentiments across the country than the superb interview of Hamid Ansari, and the censored television address of Tripura CM Manik Sarkar. Taken as a whole, these unconnected but significant incidents point to just one thing: Paranoia, and a lack of trust. As Hamid Ansari stated, ‚ÄúOverall, the very fact that the Indianness of any citizen is being questioned is a disturbing thought.‚Äù

Narendra Modi may have been extra considerate this year, when he made the shortest (56 minutes) Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. As expected, it was peppered with the usual alliterations, and word play with the rather trite ‚Äògolis‚Äô and ‚Äògaalis‚Äô reference. There was little by way of content to reassure citizens when exactly the elusive ‚Äòacche din‚Äô will finally arrive ‚Äî if they exist at all. Just a few days earlier, Hamid Ansari had spoken up boldly during an impassioned parting interview, in which he‚Äôd gone ahead and addressed the herd of elephants in India‚Äôs room. There was shock, awe and admiration when he candidly talked about the ‚Äúsense of unease among Muslims‚Äù, and referred to ‚Äúa sense of insecurity creeping in‚Äù. Was he lying? Exaggerating? Over-dramatising? Of course not! He had hit the bull‚Äôs eye. If the underlying truth in what he said didn‚Äôt make us flinch, it should have. The Prime Minister had two choices once Ansari‚Äôs interview gained momentum: A) He could have ignored Ansari. B) Or, Modi could have equally boldly stated it was time to address these prickly issues head on, since they perturb over 184 million Muslim citizens of India. He did neither. Instead, he picked a third, and very shabby option: he not only mocked the erudite gentleman who had been India‚Äôs respected Vice President for two terms (2007-2017) by saying that he had shown his true colours (read: Muslim identity) and advised him to ‚Äúfollow your basic ideology and instinct.‚Äù If this is not provocative and divisive, what is? To make it worse, the BJP dubbed Ansari a ‚Äúmannerless‚Äù man.

Chief Minister Manik Sarkar publicly stated his position (outrage!) after being asked to ‚Äòreshape‚Äô his Independence Day speech. That word ‚Äòreshape‚Äô is dangerous and loaded. Today, an elected chief minister of an important, sensitive state is being asked to ‚Äòreshape‚Äô a pre-recorded speech which was found unacceptable by Big Brother (Prasar Bharati). What chance do ordinary citizens have? We will soon be ordered ‚Äî perhaps at gunpoint ‚Äî to ‚Äòreshape‚Äô our words, thoughts, even emotions. Our diets have already been ‚Äòreshaped‚Äô. This is perhaps the first time in 70 years that a chief minister‚Äôs speech has been targeted. Surely, citizens have the right to hear it, regardless of what the Centre feels? Hamid Ansari raised the very pertinent Muslim issue of identity and belonging in today‚Äôs India, while Manik Sarkar pointed out that Dalits and minorities are under attack. Are they making it up?

These are but two intelligent, educated, aware men daring to voice what countless citizens fear. Ansari has already withdrawn into a neutral zone after the Prime Minister‚Äôs below-the-belt tongue lashing. Let‚Äôs see what happens to Manik Sarkar, who has openly accused the Central Government of censorship. When asked what action he planned to take, he answered soberly and thoughtfully, ‚ÄúI have brought this to the notice of the common people of our country. They are the best ones to judge what is going on.‚Äù

The problem in placing so much trust in the common people is this: when the Centre controls virtually every bit of what is available for public consumption, the narrative becomes not just one-dimensional and one-sided, but also gets twisted beyond recognition. Who the hell knows what‚Äôs going on in India? Not me. Not the average citizen. And that is far scarier than the prospect of a ‚Äòsmall war‚Äô with China. I am waiting for some brilliant Niti Aayog spokesperson to reshape, recycle and represent our immediate future. The past has been taken care of, thank you."
Battle over quit India: Modi boisterously appropriates what Congress believes to be its family heirloom,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been thinking on his feet, as it were, on the issue of hitching his party to the bandwagon of freedom struggle. He is celebrating, with all the fervour that he can muster, the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement of 1942, the 70th anniversary of India‚Äôs independence, and he is planning grand celebrations for the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019 and the 75th anniversary of India‚Äôs independence in 2022.

It has become clear by now that Modi believes hugely in atmospherics. The main opposition party, Congress, feels left out and more than a little peeved by the PM‚Äôs boisterous appropriation of the freedom struggle, which the grand old party of India believes to be its family heirloom.

Congress leaders have always been contemptuous of the Hindu right-wing and they have forever taunted their ideological adversaries for having never taken part in the freedom struggle. Of course, the charge is unfair in historical terms. There were many who did not believe in the politics of agitation popularised by Mahatma Gandhi from 1920 onwards which placed the Congress party in the lead position, but who had been looking at other ways of gaining independence from British suzerainty.

The Muslim League was never part of the agitational approach of Gandhi‚Äôs Congress, and neither were many other sections like the Zamindars, the Unionist Party in Punjab, the Justice Party in the Madras presidency and the Krishak Samaj Party in Bengal. One of the prominent leaders who did not accept Gandhi‚Äôs extra-constitutional approach was BR Ambedkar.

So, if the case is to be argued as to whether people who did not court prison and raise anti-British slogans did not fight for freedom from the British, then it would be an argument that would be difficult to sustain. There were different political groups and each dealt with the British keeping in mind what they believed to be their own interests. There is little doubt that Congress had a broader viewpoint than all the others put together. It claimed to speak for the whole country, for all the groups and all the regions. The others contested the Congress claim to be representing all.

This was specially so in the case of Muslim League. The Hindu right-wingers were indeed in a quandary because they could not say that Congress did not represent the Hindu majority. As a matter of fact, the League dubbed the Congress as the party of the Hindus. There was no room in the arena for other Hindu sectional interests. Hindu Mahasabha leaders like MR Jayakar and Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya continued to exert influence in Congress. In a way, communal Hindu elements found a voice within Congress. Nehru and others were aware of this and greatly resented their presence.

Modi has turned the argument over whether one participated in the freedom struggle on its head by asserting that present day India ruled by BJP derives inspiration from the 1942 Quit India Movement to transform India. In contrast, all that Congress president Sonia Gandhi could bring herself to say was that it was Jawaharlal Nehru who had moved the Quit India resolution on August 9, 1942. Sonia was clutching a twig of history, while Modi took upon himself the burden of carrying the spirit of Quit India Movement, at least by way of rhetoric, to transform India of today.

Congress has now been reduced to a party which clings to memories of the past, invoking its heroism of long ago to seek solace in its bleak present and infuriated by the Modi strategy of appropriating the heritage of the freedom movement for BJP with much panache. It can be said that Modi‚Äôs words and gestures sound hollow because he does not really believe in the Gandhian morality of loving the adversary. And most importantly, he is not able to come to terms with Gandhi‚Äôs proclaimed political heir, Nehru.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee had no hesitation in looking up to the Nehruvian legacy because Vajpayee had greater self-confidence than Modi does. The prime minister‚Äôs belligerence in what he says and what he does not say betrays a brittle sense of his own self. But he is moving in the right direction by acknowledging loudly and clearly events like the Quit India Movement which was essentially a Congress ploy.

It can be seen in retrospect that the Quit India Movement was a historical blunder because the Muslim League and others became stronger between 1942 and 1945. Many Congress leaders, including Nehru, were not comfortable with Gandhi‚Äôs decision. Though it was a tactical blunder, Gandhi was right in going ahead with it because all the Congress leaders were imprisoned, and when they came out of prison at the end of the war, they were burnished heroes who had paid the price for refusing to go with the British war effort.

But no Congress leader of the day ever showed any resentment towards the bureaucracy, towards the Indian armed forces who participated in World War II, nor with the industrialists and many others from different walks of life who were not in the Quit India Movement. Congress in 1945 carried everyone else with it. Modi seems to be trying to appropriate the legacy of the freedom struggle with barely a nod towards Congress. Congress‚Äôs anger is palpable."
Squash Champion Harinder Pal Sandhu Is Upset After Not Being Named In The Arjuna Award List,"Country's leading squash player Harinder Pal Sandhu, the 2014 Asian Games team gold medalist, has been left dejected after being ignored by the Arjuna awards selection panel for the third time.

""I was pretty confident that I would be chosen for the honour this time. It is deeply disappointing when you are not picked despite being a deserving candidate,"" Sandhu said.

BCCL/Representational Image

The 28-year-old is left with no other option than to apply for the award next year with the sports ministry confirming the recipients list yesterday.

Sandhu, a winner of nine titles on the pro tour PSA, had played a big role in India winning its maiden squash gold at the Asian Games. He teamed up with Saurav Ghosal to beat a fancied Malaysia in the gold medal match in Incheon.

Ghosal, who has been India's number one male squash player for a long time, has also come out in support of Sandhu saying he was a lot more deserving for the Arjuna than someone like an Anaka Alankamony, who controversially received the honour in 2014.

BCCL

""If benchmarks used for Harry (Sandhu) and Anaka were the same, then Harry should have got the award ahead of her. There is no doubt about that. Harry has also won a national title while Anaka never won one,"" said Ghosal, who lost to Sandhu in the 2015 Nationals before regaining the title the following year.

The famous Indian squash trio of Ghosal, Joshna Chinappa and Dipika Pallikal have all been rewarded with an Arjuna.

However, Sandhu is yet to win an individual medal at the Asian or Commonwealth level and it might have affected his chances. He, though, has always been an important member in team events.

BCCL

Sandhu is disheartened with the snub but remains determined to make a stronger case for Arjuna next year.

""We have the Asian and Commonwealth Games next year and will try to win a medal in both the events. I am sure, after I win medals there, it will become more difficult for the committee to ignore me,"" said the world number 65, who recently won a couple of PSA 5K titles in Australia, taking his overall tally to nine.

"Australia recall Faulkner, Coulter-Nile for India tour","AUSTRALIA SQUAD ANNOUNCEMENT FOR INDIA TOUR

Australia recall Faulkner, Coulter-Nile for India tour

Australia have recalled all-rounder James Faulkner and pacer Nathan Coulter-Nile for their upcoming tour of India. While Faulkner makes his way back to the ODI squad, Coulter-Nile finds a place in squads of both the limited-overs formats. The T20I squad also includes uncapped left-arm pacer Jason Beherendorff, who averages 19.47 for his 53 scalps in 38 T20s.

Left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Starc, meanwhile, continues his recovery from an injury to his right foot away from the game. The spearhead of Australia's bowling attack sustained the injury midway through Australia's Test tour of India early this year. He played the Champions Trophy but has been given more time to return to his best.

With the upcoming Ashes series in mind, Starc has not been included in Australia's two-Test tour of Bangladesh (starting from August 27) as well as the India tour.

Australian team physiotherapist David Beakley explained that that the fast bowler's recovery has been slower than expected: ""We have recently reviewed the progress of Mitchell's right foot injury and the healing process has been slower than we would have liked.""

""Consequently, in order to ensure his best possible preparation for the Ashes, he will be unavailable for the Tour of India and will continue his rehab in Australia with an aim to have him play for New South Wales in the domestic one-day cup.""

Australia are scheduled to play five ODIs and three T20Is in India during the months of September and October this year.

ODI squad: Steve Smith, David Warner, Aaron Finch, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Travis Head, Matthew Wade, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, James Faulkner, Josh Hazlewood, Ashton Agar, Hilton Cartwright, Adam Zampa T20I squad: Steve Smith, David Warner, Jason Behrendorff, Daniel Christian, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, Aaron Finch, Travis Head, Moises Henriques, Glenn Maxwell, Tim Paine, Kane Richardson, Adam Zampa

After constantly being laid low by injuries, Coulter-Nile found success while representing Kolkata Knight Riders during IPL 2017. The fast bowler, who bagged 15 wickets in eight games for KKR, is expected to make a big impression during the India tour. Cricket Australia selector Trevor Hohns talked up Coulter-Nile's return while also praising all-rounder Faulkner's familiarity with the sub-continent.

""Nathan brings raw pace to the side with good variation. It is great to see him back from injury and we are hopeful he will have a big impact in this series. ""James Faulkner is a solid One-Day campaigner and is very familiar with sub-continent conditions, coming off a very good tour of Sri Lanka last year. We hope that he will take his chance in returning to the one-day side,"" Hohns said.

Cricket Australia have also invested some amount of faith in Western Australia all-rounder Hilton Cartwright, picking him in both the squads. Cartwright, who made his Test debut for Australia earlier this year, comes with the reputation of being a big-hitter and is expected to slot into the shorter format with ease.

""Hilton is an aggressive striker of the ball and we think his game will be well suited to the transition to short-form cricket,"" Hohns opined.

While wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Paine has kept his T20I spot despite poor outings with the bat during the home series against Sri Lanka in February, all-rounder Daniel Christian braces himself for a return to the national side after more than three years.

A Miracle! Saints Injured In Utkal Express Derailment Thank Muslims For Saving Their Lives,"The derailment of Utkal Express near Muzaffarnagar took 23 lives and left many injured, but the accident paved way for an exemplary episode of communal harmony where people helped one another. One example of it came to fore when saints travelling in the train was rescued by local Muslims.

""I remember my head bumping into the seat in front of me, throwing me at least two feet forward. I was in pain and could her screams from all directions. Honestly, if it hadn't been for Muslims in the area who rushed to the spot and pulled us out of the train's coach, we might not have survived,"" said Bhagwan Das Maharaj, a saint with a saffron cloth tied around his neck. He was travelling with six other ascetics who had boarded the Utkal Express from Morana in Madhya Pradesh and were going to Haridwar to take a holy dip in Ganga.

""They brought us water, khaats and arranged for a private doctor for us. We will never forget this gesture,"" he added. Three saints from the group were injured and were rushed to Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College in Meerut for treatment.

""We believe in God and we saw his power soon after the accident. There are times when people politicize Hindu-Muslim ties, but there has always been love between the two communities,"" said Morni Das, another saint.

Soon after 14 coaches of Haridwar-bound Kalinga Utkal Express derailed near Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar, government and private hospitals in Meerut were put on alert and emergency wards were set up for the accident victims. ""There were many women and children in our coach. All of us were chit-chatting and suddenly our coach overturned. Initially, we didn't realize what had happened,"" said another saint Hakim Das.

Dr Raj Kumar Chaudhary, Meerut's chief medical officer, said, ""As many as 23 people have been taken to different hospitals in Meerut and are being given treatment. Also, 26 government ambulances and 26 private ambulances were rushed to the accident site to take the victims to hospitals.""

Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story,"SPOTLIGHT Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story Vishaal Loganathan Share Tweet Share

All of 15 when the tsunami hit, Dinesh Chandimal saw, lost, won and lived through it, as he intends to do the same for Sri Lankan cricket now ¬© Getty

As a 15-year-old, Dinesh Chandimal sat at home and watched on TV as Sri Lanka were handed a hammering by New Zealand in Auckland. More than 10000 kilometers away, in Ambalangoda, Chandimal was watching intently hoping to gather whatever points he could. He had to. Chandimal had packed his bags and his cricketing gear the day earlier. He had been called up for the trials for the Sri Lankan Under-15 team. It was to be one of the first steps towards realising a lifelong goal.

It was a poya, full moon day, and as usual the house was being cleaned. Chandimal's mother had stepped out to clear the garbage. Moments later, he heard a screech from his mother. ""Actually, we thought it was a snake or something,"" says Chandimal. But it was the tsunami, or 'The Devil', as Chandimal constantly says.

Ambalangoda was one of the worst hit areas. The waves were more than 15 feet high and came in at a rapid pace. After the first wave had hit the village, the waters drew back, before coming back stronger and more menacingly. The devastation left thousands homeless, hopeless, hungry and frightened. It killed as many, if not more.

""We went there and saw, and one of the uncles in our village, he came and saw for just five seconds and said 'the tsunami has come as a devil'. He said to us 'Please run with your children.' He shouted to us. Then, we ran. Ran for, I think, 200-300 meters. Fortunately, there was a hill. So we ran to that hill and we stayed there. From there, we saw our home and everything going like foam.""

""The tsunami came as the devil,"" Chandimal repeatedly says while talking about that fateful day. Until then, he hadn't even heard the word 'tsunami'. The incidents and memories of that day are fresh and vivid in his mind, and the pain in his voice is all too apparent. He watched his house, his recently-packed kit bag and everything he and his family owned being washed away by the sea. It swallowed up everything, but it also left in its wake a swathe of dead bodies, people Chandimal would've known. Chandimal could only watch on helpless from atop a hill. He and his family were safe, for now.

In the aftermath of the tsunami, a shaken Chandimal went hunting for his kit bag. He had to travel to Colombo for the trials. He found his bag more than two kilometers away, wet and useless. Chandimal wasn't stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea, here the devil was the deep blue sea.

It left him and his family with mental scars that won't easily be erased. ""Of course, it's always at the back of our minds. After tsunami, we went to the sea only twice. That much we were scared as a family. But you know that's the way life goes...""

The events of December 26, 2004, strengthened Chandimal. His family was now without a house, without any clothes or food. It made him resolute, his family's well-being became his main focus and he ensured he reached his goal through cricket.

""One time, in 2004, we didn't have a house to stay. This is a hotel,"" he says, looking around the swanky MovenPick Hotel in Colombo. ""My parents and my family and myself, we put a lot of hard work for me to become a player and a captain. The word is hard work.""

""We were affected by tsunami. We lost everything. Tsunami came as the devil and broke everything. So actually that (motivated me) to become an international cricketer and become a good cricketer. So that was the strength I think, after the tsunami. Then I was thinking I have to stick to my cricket, then I put some target - I want to be this, I want to be this man, this player and stuff.

""One or two months, we struggled as a family. We didn't have a place to stay. (We had) food issues, some clothes issues... So, but I think that gave me really good (motivation) to become a good cricketer.""

So when the opportunity to take his cricket to the next level came calling, Chandimal accepted it, albeit with a heavy heart. The current Test captain was the star of his team, Dharmasoka College, with both bat and behind the wickets. ""My wicketkeeping was superb in that time, I was flying to take catches. No mistakes! Like now,"" he laughs.

Against Ananda College, he was the only player to show some fight, scoring 77 not out as the team folded for 120. The coach of Ananda College, Udayananda Perera, was soon at his house, asking his parents to send him to Colombo.

""Actually, my parents pushed me to go to Ananda College. I didn't want to go. Because in Dharmasoka College, it was my first school and I loved playing there, in my home town. My parents told me, 'If you're there (Ananda College), at least you can get a good job. So then, I said 'Okay, I should go now because we have so many family problems.' We didn't have a good home, actually. For six months, we stayed at the government apartments. We were there for six months. So then I felt 'Okay, I should go, I should come to Colombo and play cricket'.

At Ananda College, Chandimal put in the hard yards. His days in the hostel were far from a breeze. He was not with his family, and the food was not to his liking. But he ensured he always put on a smile when his family asked about him.

""I didn't know (anyone in Colombo). I stayed at the hostel, Ananda hostel, for 3-4 years. And I used to eat that hostel food. It's always tough (laughs). Sometimes my parents called me and asked 'Son, are you okay with the food? Are you okay with the stay?' But sometimes, I'm not okay with the food, sometimes I didn't take my breakfast because breakfast was not good to eat. But I didn't say anything to them. I said, 'Yes, I am fine'. And so that's the way I was there at the hostel.""

But it was not all gloom, either. Chandimal maintained a good relationship with everyone at the college, and he was repaid with kindness. He is not sure why, but ventures that maybe it was because of his good behaviour.

""There were the workers, they gave a lot of help to me. Sometimes, when I am not there, when I am out for practice, they make my food, and when I come to the hostel, they bring it to my room. They took care of me really well. I just love to talk the right things with the good people. I feel that's why they loved me.""

From running for his life to now running the country's Test team, Chandimal's life has been a ride full of ups and downs.

Even as captain of the Sri Lankan Test team, Chandimal goes through the bumps regularly. He was handed over the side after Angelo Mathews decided he could not handle captaincy any more. Soon after, he watched as his side suffered a whitewash at home to India. He still has utmost confidence in his team, and says it has the right ingredients. Now his focus is on ensuring all the players play with freedom, to rid his team of any fears, or problems.

""It's really an honour and a privilege to be the captain of Sri Lanka cricket team. I came with a really hard youth, tough times. I had tough times, good times. As a captain and a player, I just want to give the good things for my players. I just want to take care of them as my brothers. If something happens on the outside, I just want to control that and give good freedom to the youngsters to perform well.

""I just want to, as a captain, take the responsibility or blame. Anything from the outside and I'll get that as a captain. I just want to be relaxed and not put any pressure on my players. That is what I wanted to do. Because I know the hard times, when it comes to you. Actually, once I got my Test captaincy, I said to the players, 'I just want unity first, then attitude, focus, discipline and passion'. That's what I am always discussing with players and staff.""

Just like he did with his family, Chandimal always puts his team first. It's what he did when he was first made the captain too, in 2013.

""To be honest, I was struggling in 2014 with the pressure. Then after that I learnt a lot from that. How to handle the pressure. How to handle the people. How to handle players, how they're thinking and stuff. That gave me a lot of learning. Now, I can take more pressure, and give freedom to my players. 2013 was a tough time to captain the side, because in that time there were experienced players with a young side. I feel I handled it well. The thing is I didn't perform as a player, because I batted at number 6. In T20s, if you bat at number 6, you get only 2-3 overs. So you can't score big runs. You can get only 10-20 runs. As a captain, I had to open or bat at number 3, but I didn't want to do that.

""Because at that time, there was Kusal Janith (Perera). He was playing outstanding (cricket). So then I thought it is better to play Kusal as opener with Dilshan, there's a left-right hand opening combination. Then we had Mahela, then Sangakkara, then Angelo. I wanted to put the most experienced players in the first 10-15 overs. Then, myself at 6. I didn't think about myself, I just thought about the team. How to win. How to lift the World Cup for my mother country. So that's what I always think as a captain. I don't care about my performance, I don't care about my position. That's my first experience as captain in 2013-14.

Now Chandimal captains the Test side without any of the big names who were around in 2013. He's left shouldering the nation's hopes alongside an oft-injured and probably mentally-drained Mathews, and the ageing Rangana Herath. With the team failing to put up a fight, the task has only gotten harder for Chandimal.

""It's always hard, mate. Specially when you're losing games. There are so many questions, but if you're winning - no questions. When you are doing the right things, I feel we are doing so many bad mistakes. When we are not doing well, we don't do any mistakes. It's always tough. Maybe at the moment, we are like that. We are looking forward to get the good results in the future, within six months or one year.

""If you're playing international cricket, as a player, mental toughness is very important because these days, there's so much media and social media (pressure). Someone doesn't like you and they shout at you and stuff. As a player, you have to keep yourself mentally right and at the same time, you have to do your homework as a batsman or bowler.""

In 2004, Dinesh Chandimal stood on a hill and watched in horror his house being flooded and then being washed away. He resolved to fight for his family and take care of them. He did that through his cricket. Even now, when he speaks to his parents, they credit him for putting them back on their feet. ""They tell me every time I meet them, 'now we are in a good position, that's because of you.' And I say, 'No, not because of me, because of we all put our hard work in as a family. That's why we are here, not only because of me.'""

Now his goals have changed. In 2017, he stands as Sri Lanka's captain and watches as his side slips in one shocking performance after another. He again resolves to fight for his team, and take care of them. He must be the right man to take them forward. Because when you've seen, lost, won and lived through what he's seen, lost, won and lived through, fighting and succeeding is in your blood.

Remove BCCI's current office bearers: CoA to SC

Cricbuzz Staff ‚Ä¢ Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 05:39 PM

The CoA is unhappy with the ouster of CEO Rahul Johri from the BCCI meeting ¬© AFP

In its fifth status report submitted to the Supreme Court, the Committee of Administrators (CoA) has asked for the removal of the current office bearers of the BCCI for the non-compliance of the court's orders to adopt the Lodha reforms. The CoA cited the court's January 2 ruling that ousted Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke from their BCCI posts, for the eviction of acting president CK Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary.

""The Committee of Administrators submits that since the then President and Secretary of the BCCI had been removed because the BCCI failed to implement the reforms mandated by the Judgement despite a period of six months having passed, it is only fair that the current office bearers be treated in the same manner because a further period of six months have elapsed since the said office bearers submitted their undertakings and the reforms mandated by this Hon'ble Court have still not been implemented,"" the report stated.

The report has been submitted two days ahead of the July 18 hearing, wherein the three-member SC bench comprising Justices Deepak Misra, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud will reconsider some of the Lodha recommendations which it previously accepted, like the one-state-one-vote, strength of the selection committee and the concept of associate membership. Earlier in an SGM held on July 26, BCCI had decided to selectively adopt the Lodha reforms, leaving out five of them.

It was during the same SGM on July 26, when BCCI CEO Rahul Johri was asked to leave. The latest report by CoA, claims that the office-bearers deliberately misconstrued the SC order and ousted Johri from the SGM.

""After the attendance register was signed, the CEO and the other administrative staff including the legal team of the BCCI was asked to leave the meeting on the purported basis that the order dated July 24, 2017 passed by this hon'ble Court only permits office bearers to attend the same""

The CoA further wrote that this was a pre-planned and orchestrated move by the BCCI and explained the 'obvious' motive behind the same. ""The motivations of such a clever manoeuvre are fairly obvious. The presence of the CEO in the previous SGM held on June 26, 2017 had enabled the Comittee of Administrators to receive first-hand account of the proceedings and bring conduct of certain specific individuals to the attention of this Hon'ble Court. The absence of CEO from the July 26 SGM would make (and has made) that task very difficult.""

The CoA brought to SC's notice that the BCCI had failed to adopt a new fund disbursement policy which was formulated by Deloitte in line with the Lodha reforms. ""Adoption of the new fund disbursment policy by BCCI is one such reform aimed at ensuring proper allocation of funds to the State Associations based on need/requirement and with appropriate checks in place to ensure proper utlization and reporting by State associations.""

The report conveyed to the SC, BCCI's failure to appoint a new Ombudsman, despite the position being left vacant since September 2016 after the Justice (retd.) AP Shah stepped down. He had been roped in to address the conflict of interest issues prevalent within Indian cricket. The CoA also noted that the BCCI failed to adopt the new BCCI conflict of interest rules during the SGM in July, despite being handed the copy of the same through email more than a month prior to the meeting. Since the BCCI did not list new conflict of interest rules as one of the five reforms it was against, there was no justifiable reason for BCCI to not adopt the same.

""I have lived a very active life all this while. Being someone who loves to trek and cycle to maintain a steady weight, gaining too much weight is a big no-no. I am at 108 kg for the role and any more change might get difficult to reverse,"" Anjali said in a statement.

""Dhhai Kilo Prem"", which will be aired on Star Plus starting from April 3, is an unusual story of two imperfect individuals -- Deepika and Piyush (Meherzan Mazda).

Well done, DU!"
Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week‚Äôs declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee‚Äôs book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose‚Äôs Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji‚Äôs hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji‚Äôs prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
The dilemma that Charlottesville poses for us,"Most of us may not know where Charlottesville is in the United States. I have no hesitation in admitting I didn‚Äôt till the events of 12th August rocked not just that country, but the rest of the world as well. More than the events themselves, it was the Trump response and the reactions to that, which has lessons for us here at home.

The Charlottesville incident involved an ISIS style attack by a lone 20 year old white nationalist who deliberately mowed down a group of counter protesters with his car. They were confronting Neo- Nazi White Supremacists holding a rally objecting to the shifting of a statue of General Robert E Lee from a public park. It resulted in the death of 32 year old woman, Heather D Heyer, and injuries to nineteen others. That apart, there were fist fights aplenty between both sides as well as against the Police that was attempting to control the outbreak of violence.

General Lee headed the Confederate Armies from June 1861 till his surrender to General Ulysses S Grant in April 1865 that resulted in the collapse of the South and end to the Civil War. Ironically, while he may have now become a rallying point for the ‚ÄòAlt Right‚Äô he famously wrote to his wife in 1856, years before the Civil War that ‚ÄúIn this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country.‚Äù[i] Though, it must be added that he did, by no means, actively oppose slavery and in fact owned hundreds of slaves on his wife‚Äôs Plantation, Arlington. Interestingly, he was also opposed to the idea of Confederate monuments writing a year before his death in 1870 that ‚Äúnot to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife.‚Äù[ii]

Obviously, Trump with little understanding or knowledge of the Civil War and its consequences has been foolish enough to equate the actions of the Neo-Nazis to those who opposed them. That his actions have earned him much opprobrium, not just from those politically opposed to him, but also from leaders of his own Republican Party, as well as from members of the international community. Indeed, it appears there has now been a general realization among vast swathes of American society, including those of Indian origin, they may have voted the wrong guy in. They did this in their earnestness to oppose the perceived ill-effects of globalization and the actions of the liberal left leaning establishment that appeared to be favouring minorities and others at the cost of Middle America. Little did they realize that they may have voted in an unstable egotistic racist bigot with an extremely narrow world view. He appears to be bent on feathering his own nest with little or no moral qualms and completely uncaring as to the consequences of his actions. While speaking on the unfortunate incident, he even had the temerity to plug his own winery located there!

By his present actions, and even his statements given during campaigning, he has emboldened White Supremacists and other Alt-Right groups, his core electoral base, which has resulted in increasing attacks on religious and ethnic minorities. In the process he has also put his closest aides in the White House and members of his Cabinet on the horns of a moral dilemma. Should they continue to work for him in the hope that they would be able to control his most destructive actions or should they adopt a more honest and moral line and resign? The saving grace, however, has been the fact that there have been some in Government and from his Party who have refused to be bullied and have called him out. We even have had the Armed Forces Chiefs forthrightly condemn the Neo Nazis, though they have taken care not to embarrass their Commander-in-Chief by naming him, something completely unimaginable here.

Strident attacks by hardline right wing groups is not a phenomenon restricted just to the United States but has impacted most corners of the globe. In our own Nation we are witness to rising intolerance on the part of the Hindutva Brigade that is reflected in the increasing attacks on minorities and Dalits as well as restrictions on what we can wear, eat or watch. That vigilantism is supported, if not encouraged, by the establishment in some of the States only adds to our problems. Other than ineffectual statements Mr. Modi has done little to control the upsurge of violence. That our politicians lack empathy for the marginalized is clearly seen from the manner in which the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh devoted himself to organizing a religious festival at the time his State was reeling from the most terrible of tragedies, the death of seventy children at a Government Hospital in Gorakhpur leaves one speechless.

Even in Sierra Leone, which is still recovering from decades of brutal civil war, the Government was prompt in declaring a week of national mourning after mud slides wiped away villages and killed hundreds. That is how civilized governments react to tragedy, something that seems to have escaped our political leadership here. They seem to be capable of only engaging in verbal jousts with each other over insignificant issues and have no interest in dealing with the difficult business of governance which allowed for this horrendous breach of faith.

If just seven months of a Trump Presidency can tear holes into a 241 year old democracy, just think as to how vulnerable and fragile our democracy is after just seventy years of Independence. Unlike Trump Prime Minister Modi is far more restrained and mature but there are similarities in the manner that they have handled the violent acts indulged in by members of the nationalist far right who seem to revel in the politics of exclusion. The end result of their actions is not difficult to foresee as it can only add to existing fissiparous tendencies and further vitiate an already difficult internal security situation.

Finally, it creates a dilemma for the average liberal voter who may have supported Mr. Modi in the last General Elections. In 2019 he will be faced with a Hobson‚Äôs choice, given that the opposition has failed to deal with the twin abominations of dynastic politics and corruption. There also appear to be none within the establishment who would be willing to challenge those who are deliberately supporting forces of hate and pseudo nationalism. That can hardly bode well for either our democratic institutions or our future.

"Charlottesville Fallout: In drawing equivalence between far-right groups and liberals, Trump is undermining American democratic values","The raging turmoil in the US following the Charlottesville racist attack is being stoked by none other than President Donald Trump. Instead of condemning the attack ‚Äì which saw a suspected white supremacist ram his car into a crowd of protesters opposing a rally of far-right organisations ‚Äì in unequivocal terms, Trump has sought to draw equivalence between the two groups and blamed both for the violence. If this weren‚Äôt enough, Trump has now criticised the nationwide movement of removing statues and memorials dedicated to pro-slavery Confederate figures from America‚Äôs civil war. He has described these statutes and memorials as part of American history and adding to the beauty of the cities and parks they are located in.

Needless to say this is total hogwash. America‚Äôs evolution as a democracy has long rejected racism and provided a beacon for emancipation and human rights. Of course, this process is ongoing as exemplified by the prevalence of racist incidents even today in the US. But in official political discourse racist thought, ideas and spirit have been totally rejected.

Trump, however, is seeking to overturn this. It‚Äôs clear now that white supremacists and the alt-right comprise his core constituency. And it is to send subtle messages of solidarity to this group that Trump is using sophisticated language that appears to project neutrality in readings of history. This is nothing but another clever ploy by right-wing groups across the world to gain political traction. Under the garb of objectivity, these groups are trying to bring back in vogue dark figures of history. In doing so they are sanitising chapters of the past that ought to shock and revolt. Somehow, objectivity is becoming the rallying cry of the most obscurantist forces in society.

Saying that public statutes and memorials of controversial figures from the American civil war should be left alone because they are part of history is unacceptable. These monuments offend the sensibilities of a majority of American people, not just the African-American community. As a counterfactual, if the Confederates had won the American civil war, US democracy wouldn‚Äôt have evolved the way it did and Barack Obama would never have become a president. But that‚Äôs not what happened and most American people are proud that the US is considered as a leader of plural democracy. Hence, to ascribe equivalence to an alternative right-wing narrative of US history is specious ‚Äì that narrative was defeated and rejected.

Similarly, Trump criticising the removal of statues and memorials of Confederate figures by saying that tomorrow it could lead to removal of monuments dedicated to the country‚Äôs founding fathers who were slave owners is again trickery to fool people. America‚Äôs founding fathers stood for anti-colonialism and republicanism. They belonged to a time when, unfortunately, overall human and political consciousness hadn‚Äôt evolved to the point of recognising the inherent injustice of slavery. But that isn‚Äôt the case with Confederate figures from the Civil War who fought to preserve the way of life in the American South, including slavery.

America‚Äôs founding fathers are celebrated for fighting for liberty and self-determination, not for preserving slavery. But Confederate figures actually fought to protect the slave economy of the American South. Hence, there‚Äôs a huge difference between the two groups. Ultimately, people who read and interpret history do need to take sides and make qualitative judgments. Slavery was bad. Nazism was bad. The Holocaust was bad. One simply can‚Äôt treat these dark chapters of the past as normal historical incidents. If we do that, how are we ever going to learn from history and stop repeating mistakes of the past?"

Aishwarya & Madhavan Just Might Collaborate For A Romantic Film & We‚Äôre Excited Already,"No matter how many times he has denied that he won‚Äôt do chocolate boy roles anymore, fans still want to see R. Madhavan playing one of those and spread his soothing charm on the silver screen. It has been long that we haven‚Äôt seen him in such a role but now it seems that there is a possibility that he will play a romantic hero all over again.

Sometime back it was revealed that Anil Kapoor is also a part of the project but soon he denied that he‚Äôll be romantically paired alongside Aish. So, the Taal jodi is coming back together but their story wouldn‚Äôt lead to a love angle supposedly.

The battle against cancer is heating up,"India‚Äôs battle against cancer has never been on a high but the scenario could now change, thanks to an unique effort from a corporate honcho and a seasoned cancer physician who are keen to highlight why cancer is on the rise across the world and pose a particular threat in many low- and middle-income countries.

Their efforts are making many sit up and take notice. The war against cancer, thanks to the duo, has reached a new level. Indians are understanding why cancer deaths globally far exceed those from such devastating infectious diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. International health agencies admit that global mortality from those three diseases has, in fact, been cut substantially ‚Äî by nearly half in the case of malaria ‚Äî over the past decade, but cancer is a different, difficult disease to handle, the two and their friends have explained.

R Venkataramanan, a suave corporate manager who always wears white, starched shirt and black trousers like a lawyer, and Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, and their band of friends are asking Indians to cut down on tobacco consumption because it ‚Äì sooner or later ‚Äì leads to cancer.

Those who argue against them are asked by Venkataramanan to visit the Tata Memorial Cancer hospital at 0800 hours when new patients walk in for admissions. It is, by any means, a horrible sight to see patients in total despair, hoping to live and not die.

‚ÄúSeeing is believing, a bomb is ticking away and Indians are still not realising the gravity of the situation,‚Äù says Venkataramanan, who insists that he should not be addressed as project manager at Tata Trusts. It is his war, and that of his friends like Sumitra Pednekar, whose husband Satish Pednekar, a former home and labour minister in Maharashtra, died of throat cancer and some doctors from Tata Memorial Hospital whose PIL in the Bombay high court against the government and state-run insurers, including LIC, for holding shares in Kolkata-based cigarette maker ITC, has made many sit up and take notice.

The petition is being heard and seasoned lawyers ‚Äì expectedly ‚Äì have lined up to defend the tobacco major. But that, claims Venkataramanan, should not take the sting out of the fight against cancer. The duo have figures from the International Agency for Research on Cancer to back their claim.

IARC says cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases in 2012. In two decades, the number of new cases is expected to rise by about 70 percent. Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and was responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2015. Globally, nearly 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer. ‚ÄúThe most commonly diagnosed cancers were lung, breast and colorectal cancers such as lung, mouth and throat are attributable to tobacco habits,‚Äù says Dr Chaturvedi. Less-developed regions of the world accounted for more than half of all new cancer cases and almost two-thirds of all cancer deaths.

The debate is growing stronger by the day. Those against cancer argue if nothing is done to reduce smoking, smokers will soar across the world. Hence, it‚Äôs imperative that international trade agreements uphold the ability of individual countries to regulate the sale and marketing of tobacco products within their borders. But the tobacco industry ‚Äì flushed with cash ‚Äì argues that this would restrict free trade. Analysts call it a frivolous argument, little more than an effort by tobacco companies to bully their way into emerging markets.

Venkataramanan says from a health perspective, it is also dangerously irresponsible. He argues tobacco control efforts have been credited with preventing about eight million premature deaths. Yet tobacco control in many countries across the world is quite weak. And India is one of them.

Worse, only about a third of the world prohibit smoking in public places, and very few countries follow the World Health Organization recommendation to tax cigarettes at 75 percent of the retail price. There are other issues as well. Cancer scientists always focus on only cigarettes in their analysis, leaving out cancers caused by secondhand smoke, pipes, hookahs, beedis, cigars, smokeless tobacco and electronic nicotine, delivery systems

Venkatramanan wants some serious conversations around cancer because tobacco is responsible for nearly 50 percent cancers in India and 90 percent of mouth cancer patients die within 12 months of diagnosis.

For strange reasons, everyone wants to avoid the debate.

The insurance companies, along with UTI, argue they are trying to get the best return on their investments and that they are not promoting use of tobacco or even the company in any way. Together, they hold 32 percent stake in ITC, worth Rs 1.07 trillion.

India‚Äôs biggest argument over what many claim is the biggest life-threatening disease, has just begun. Eventually, someone will have to take a call, to invest or not invest."
IIT Madras Builds Particle Detector On Campus To Help CERN Unravel The Mysteries Of Dark Matter,"Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-M) is setting up an exclusive centre on its premises for research, and to develop a silicon tracker detector that will go into upgrading the massive 14,000 tonne CMS (compact muon solenoid) detector, which is studying a wide range of physics including the dark matter that makes up the universe.

IITM

The CMS detector is installed by CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, in France.

The dedicated Silicon Detector Research and Development and Application Centre to be set up at IIT Madras at a cost of Rs 6 crore, will be part of India-CMS collaboration. The Centre is expected to be operational by end of 2018.

‚ÄúThe main purpose of this centre is to work with other Indian collaborating institutes to build a ‚Äò2000 silicon detector module‚Äô that will be part of the CMS detector at CERN,‚Äù said Prafulla Kumar Behera, associate professor, department of physics, IIT-Madras.

Representational Image

The main CMS detector in France will undergo upgradation in 2025 when the existing silicon tracker detector dies out. The silicon tracker detector is one of the four subdetectors in the main CMS detector. Data from the main detector installed 100m below ground may help scientists understand the evolution of the universe better.

Prof Behera said the centre not only aims at conducting cutting-edge research with advanced machine tools but will also train students in the process. ‚ÄúIIT-Madras is also offering summer internships at CERN for our undergraduate students since 2015,‚Äù he said.

Representational Image

Scientists said the sensor that goes into the detector a technology for which is available only in a few countries has several potential spinoff applications like medical imaging that can help the Indian healthcare sector. ‚ÄúIf we could get such technologies, may be in the future we can use them if we are going to build such detectors in our country,‚Äù Behera said.

IIT-M became the first IIT to be made a full member of the CMS experiment at CERN in 2014. India became as associate member of CERN in 2016.

GOD‚ÄôS OWN CITY,"As GUSTASP and JEROO IRANI stroll along Mathura‚Äôs alleys and ghats, they sway to the bhajans in a collective tide of devotion as they hail Krishna on his birthday



The man with a flowing grey beard was the third person to suggest that we remove our glasses as we ambled down the narrow street that led to the river ghats of the holy city of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh.Our curiosity was peaked.‚ÄúMonkeys.They are chashma chor ‚Äî spectacle stealing thieves,‚Äù he explained.The troop that patrolled this stretch of waterway had figured out that humans were willing to trade food for their stolen glasses...cell phones,purses, wallets and whatever else they could get their grubby hands on.Then smiling, he added:‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt blame them: Krishna was a makhan chor,the one who steals butter.He even made off with the clothes of gopis while they were bathing in the river.‚Äù We realised that Mathura revolved around Krishna.Like the time we came across a group of women attired in vividly coloured ghagra-cholis at the Gita Temple.Two young ladies broke free of the group, crossed the threshold of the rust-red temple and started to dance.They swayed to the rhythm of the silent music that stirred within their inner being. Then they stopped as suddenly as they had started.The ritual over, they ran to rejoin their companions who took turns to bend over and press their feet. Our driver-guide said that the two women probably saw themselves as gopis dancing as Krishna played the flute.Suddenly it fell into place: Mathura was a living tradition whose origins went back to the mythological time when Krishna, author of the Bhagwad Gita,grew up in the region. Born here under compelling circumstances, the child who would later drive Arjuna‚Äôs chariot in the Mahabharata wars, delighted in teasing the gopis who only seemed to love him all the more for his antics.



In Mathura,all roads eventually lead to the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple complex that commemorates the place where Krishna was born.Security police, armed with metal detectors, checked everyone ‚Äî holy men, devotees and tourists ‚Äî entering the complex. The reason for the high security was apparent: for beyond the soaring temple spires,the dome of the city‚Äôs Jami Masjid,built in 1661 by Abd-un-Nabir Khan,was clearly visible.The two shrines share a common compound wall. The central hub of the Janmbhoomi complex, however, was an unpretentious structure,quite unlike any temple building, where Krishna was born. A narrow tunnel-like passageway led to the central altar where the incarnation of Vishnu entered the world in miraculous circumstances.The story oft retold is that when the evil king Kansa learned that one of his Prime Minister‚Äôs offspring would eventually destroy him, he imprisoned the man and his wife.Over the years, as each child was born to the couple, the king entered their prison cell and killed it.



Standing in front of the altar,we felt the anguish of the parents with the loss of each child. And just when the pain seemed unbearable, the script was drastically altered for the birth of the eighth child.The heavens applauded his arrival with lightning and thunder;the chains that bound his father fell off, prison gates flew open and the guards fell into a deep stupor.The terrified father grabbed the opportunity to save his baby.Taking the infant in his arms, he walked past the sleeping guards, out of the palace complex and swam across the River Yamuna to neighbouring Vrindavan, where he swapped his son for a daughter born that very moment to one of his kin. Retracing his steps, he returned to the prison cell when suddenly the chains clamped back on him, the doors closed and the guards awoke. The next morning,the king entered to slay the newborn child,but even as he lifted it to slam it on the floor, it slipped from his grasp and soared up to the heavens.The king knew that the gods had conspired against him. In a desperate bid to stay the inevitable, he deputed a rakshas to masquerade as a woman and kill all newborn males in the kingdom by getting them to suckle at his poisoned milk breasts.The scheme came to naught when baby Krishna attached his mouth to the demon and sucked the life out of his body. The playful young lad grew up and eventually fulfilled his destiny by slaying the evil king.His mission complete, he went down to the banks of the Yamuna and rested at what is today known as Vishram Ghat.And that was where we were headed. We descended a flight of steps that led to the water and climbed into a canopied boat for a fascinating 15- minute cruise down the river.The liquid avenue fielded the reflections of the buildings ‚Äî temples, shrines, a mosque, ancient havelis... that lined its banks. Back on the ghats, we joined the swell of pilgrims to take part in the evening river aarti.



As the sun set, five young priests stepped up onto a marble platform facing the river.At a given signal, they set fire to the multiple wicks of their many-layered oil lamps. Bells tolled as the priests launched into a choreographed fire dance,swirling the flaming lamps to the rhythm of bhajans. We rode the tide of collective devotion that surged across the river like a tidal wave before surging up to the heavens. By sundown,the temple deities had retired for the night so that they could rise fresh the following morning and shower blessings on their devotees with rejuvenated vigour.We too were up early to catch the first ray of the sun as it hit the steps that rose out of the river. Our final darshan was at Dwarikadhish Mandir, on a narrow street behind the ghats.The temple, built in 1815 by Seth Gokuldas Parikh,treasurer of the state of Gwalior, is dedicated to Krishna.We entered the temple minutes before the main deity was to be unveiled.The place was brimming with devotees. Competing bhajans wove into each other to create a rich tapestry of music. The din rose to a crescendo as the minute hand on the clock edged towards the appointed time.Seconds before the fateful moment,a hush fell over the gathering.The next moment,a pujari drew aside the curtain in front of the main deity.The lord was welcomed with a cry of devotion that exploded like a thunderclap of unadulterated admiration. We added our voice to the chorus that soared up to the heavens in prayer.We emerged from the crowded temple onto the streets of a city awash with the aroma of deep-fried savouries. It was going to be a perfect day.

How will Chinese use of force in Doklam manifest?,"In competitive conflict among nations, when faced with the threat of use of force by an adversary and if you set out to confront him and call his bluff, Plan A is generally based on the premise that the adversary will not actually use force due to political, economic and military compulsions. However, Plan B is also prepared to actually deal with the threat if it manifests itself. The handling of the two month long standoff in Doklam and recurring Chinese incursions elsewhere are still based on Plan A.

This, of course, is based on post 1962 War and 1967 Nathu La experience, notably the standoffs at Sumdrong Chu 1986-87, Depsang 2013 and Chumar 2014. Thus, on the ground, we see Indian and Chinese soldiers are physically confronting each other below Doka La with neither side using ‚Äúforce‚Äù except for the ‚Äújostling‚Äù in the initial stages. There is no let-up in Chinese jingoistic rhetoric and threats. Diplomacy does not seem to have made much headway. The mood in Delhi is ‚Äújung nahin hogi‚Äù. Except for the Indian Army moving for the annual summer ‚Äúoperational alert‚Äù there are no reports of any large scale mobilisation by either side. Is the current standoff going the way of the previous prolonged ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù standoffs?

In this backdrop, let us look at Plan B on both sides. Before this, an obvious point must be made. Nations armed with nuclear weapons do not, and I dare say, cannot fight a full scale conventional war that causes major loss of territory, large scale casualties and destruction of economic infrastructure. The probability of even a limited war in multiple sectors along the LAC is relatively low. The probability of a limited war in the area of confrontation is much higher. The moot question is what form will it take?

The Indian Army‚Äôs Plan B is that all along the LAC and particularly in Sikkim, we hold dominating heights in high altitude terrain. Our defences are ‚Äúhardened‚Äù and are backed by adequate fire power, including missiles carrying Precision Guided Munitions (PGM). We have adequate reserve for counter attack and we also have tactical counter offensive capability in each theatre. Along the LAC and in Tibet the IAF has an edge. It can carry out a strategic air campaign to target the PLA centres of gravity in Tibet, namely, command and control centres, military infrastructure and troop concentrations. Indian Navy is capable of strategic interdiction of sea lanes through the Indian Ocean. We also have the option of preempting the PLA with an operational level preemptive offensive, before it mobilises in Ladakh, Chumbi Valley and North Sikkim.

In a nutshell, we are looking to fight a low end third generation war to give the PLA a bloody nose. My take is that if the limited war whether in multiple sectors or in the Sikkim Sector, takes this form, we will stalemate the Chinese which is defeat for them.

The question that arises is why would China initiate a war where its defeat is ordained? Or does it have a more imaginative Plan B that teaches India a lesson? The PLA has adopted and adapted to the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) for the last two decades, particularly in the field of cyber warfare and PGM technology. It is now only second to the USA in high-end military technology. My assessment is that the Chinese will neutralise our strategy by not getting involved in ‚Äúclose infantry combat‚Äù over unfavourable terrain. If at all it chooses to use force, its strategy will be based on technological warfare with overwhelming use of PGM and cyber warfare. It will restrict its initial offensive to the Doklam and Sikkim Sector, but would be prepared for escalation to other sectors.

Such an attack will come in the winter, when conventional ground operations are severely restricted. PLA will carry out minimal mobilisation to cater to the unlikely tactical offensive by India in the winter. A massive PGM attack will be launched on our troops at Doklam and Doka La using cruise missiles and artillery after pulling out its own troops to safety.

Simultaneously, a massive cyber attack will be launched to neutralize our command and control systems and our fire power means. The strike will be with a declared limited aim of evicting us from Doklam. Depending upon our strategic and operational response, the PLA will escalate with similar attacks on more defensive positions in Sikkim and other sectors.

Are we prepared for such an attack? Are our defences sufficiently ‚Äúhardened‚Äù and ‚Äútunnelled‚Äù to withstand a massive PGM attack? What is our progress in implementing the RMA? Do we have missile interception means? Are we trained and prepared for a winter offensive to make territorial gains? Do we have adequate counter attack capabilities using cyber warfare and PGMs?

I have no doubts that our Armed Forces have catered for such an eventuality. What measures, we can and should take will be discussed in the next column.

Does Our Faith Define Us? This Incredible Video About A Temple Will Make You Think Otherwise,"PARTNER

Can faith move mountains? It sure can, if only, you believe in the right thing. Faith is generally defined by the caste or religion that we belong to, but faith is not just about being a Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Sikh. Faith is believing in each other, it is believing in something that gives you hope and brings you happiness. Faith is about being united even when our so called caste and religion tries to divide us.

This incredible video by United Colors of Benetton, is based on a true story. It is based on the life of a man in Lucknow who gave a part of his house to make a temple. Every day he visits the temple with milk and garlands, not because his faith demands so, but because seeing people still holding on to their hopes and dreams gives him happiness. What is his caste you may ask? Pat comes the reply, he is an Indian. For him, the happiness of the people around him is more important than the caste he belongs to. Known for their strong stand to unite one and all, United Colors of Benetton strongly believe in the ideology of unity. In this video, they bring alive the incredible story of this man in Lucknow and exemplifies how we all can be #UnitedByFaith."
Racism? Not just a black and white issue,"In the early 1960s in Washington DC, my parents were on the lookout for a better house. So my mother put an ad in the classifieds, listing requirements for ‚Äúa diplomat and his family‚Äù and asking potential landlords to ring ‚ÄúMrs Ray‚Äù. One gentleman who called was polite, pleasant and appeared to have the perfect home for them. Then came the rider. ‚ÄúHow dark is the diplomat?‚Äù he asked politely and my mother hung up.

Many, many, years later, a childhood friend married a Norwegian, settled there and had a son. Her marriage didn‚Äôt last but Norway is her home now and she loves it. Given that Scandinavia always scores so highly on all the parameters we look for in terms of liveability, I asked if she ever felt that the indigenous Norwegians are racist. ‚ÄúSome of them are,‚Äù she said after much reflection. ‚ÄúBut they are polite about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúPolite racism‚Äù is an intriguing concept. We tend to think of it in terms of violent deeds, whether in South Delhi (against Africans) or in Charlottesville (against African-Americans and Jews). In my friend‚Äôs case it came in the form of a query like, ‚ÄúHow did your son like going back home to India?‚Äù ‚ÄúBack home?‚Äù she recounted to me with some indignation. ‚ÄúJust because he is half Indian? He‚Äôs born and bred in Norway!‚Äù

Racism, evidently, is not as black-and-white an issue as some believe it to be. It is complicated and confusing. For instance, the white supremacists who gathered in Charlottesville last week definitely hate the African-Americans who rallied to counter them. But they are no fans of their florid President either as he has ‚Äúlet‚Äù his daughter marry a Jew. They probably regard him as a bigger traitor than David Bowie. Not polite, these racists.

David Bowie. Not polite, these racists. Indians can be pretty nastily racist too as recent incidents have proved. But are we politely (nicely?) racist too? More by omission than commission. While many desi families now happily have white and even east Asian members ‚Äì a change from say a century ago when every other race and even region was regarded with distaste ‚Äì how many Indians have dated or married people of African descent? Until very recently, all too few.

Neena Gupta‚Äôs relationship with Vivian Richards became a byword precisely because it was so rare ditto Anjoo Mahendru‚Äôs reported fling with Gary Sobers. But actress and cookery queen Madhur Jaffrey is the actual ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù ‚Äì if the word can be used in this context ‚Äì of this kind of interracial marriage. She married the African-American classical violinist Sanford Allen nearly 50 years ago, after her divorce from Saeed Jaffrey.

It is interesting to note that despite Indians living in various African nations for many generations have remained mostly as ethnically homogenous as the other races. And a recent report on inter-racial marriages in South Africa reveals that still only 5% of ‚ÄúAsians and Indians‚Äù are likely to marry outside their race, and whites even less. What percentage of ‚Äòrebels‚Äô actually marry those of African descent is, unfortunately, not stated.

The video circulating about the Charlottesville rally also revealed one unusual fact: as the two antagonistic crowds faced off, shouting slogans and waving fists, there were no Indian or south east Asian faces to be seen. It seemed a throwback to the much less inclusive and racially diverse USA of the 1960s that my parents and brother saw. It does seem as if we Asians are still not clear about where we stand on the race issue.

Communities of single ethnicities are often not well disposed to other races or appearances. Significantly, those of African descent ‚Äì in Africa or elsewhere are no exception either, as the marriage of Botswana‚Äôs first president, Sir Seretse Khama to the Englishwoman Ruth Williams in 1948 demonstrated. Not only did her father throw her out, his uncle apparently declared ‚ÄúIf he brings his white wife here, I will fight him to the death.‚Äù

But nearly 70 years after Sir Seretse and Ruth‚Äôs wedding, Africans married to Indians today also mention family displeasure on both sides. Indian families whose sons and daughters have spouses/partners of African ethnicity take time to adjust‚Äîespecially given the light skin hang-up that still plagues us ‚Äìthough most are not outright rude. And it‚Äôs the same on the African side, as recounted by Indian spouses. Polite racism?"

Anushka & Virat‚Äôs Green Date Planting Trees In Sri Lanka Is Winning The Hearts Of Their Fans!,"In a very less period of time Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli have done a lot of things together. They share such a comfortable bond that from enjoying the sun bath to going for grocery shopping together, they have done it all.

Their dates are unusual, and that is what makes their bond special, we guess. So, recently, while other celebrity couples were being spotted on dinner dates, Virat and Anushka took time out to plant saplings together. Indeed, that must have been a beautiful date!

15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."

5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. üåº A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

Baby boy üë¶üíï A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It‚Äôs time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibeüí§ A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you‚Äôre a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you‚Äôre not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime üíï A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."
Government must develop its ‚Äòhuman capital‚Äô akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here‚Äôs another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you‚Äôre in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‚Äògovernment capital‚Äô (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks ‚Äî including the policymakers ‚Äî must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind ‚Äî at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations ‚Äî prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn‚Äôt specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government‚Äôs business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one‚Äôs own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‚Äòown‚Äô its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI‚Äôs service, become ‚Äòhuman capital architects‚Äô by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here‚Äôs How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let‚Äôs learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let‚Äôs say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here‚Äôs how you can too:

The I-Can‚Äôt-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

Click selfies with a lot of people around. They make you feel happier and prettier.

Twitter

Somehow group selfies are awesome, especially when it‚Äôs with people who love you to the core. There are a whole bunch of smiles, and when you are all dressed in your best, it‚Äôs got to be awesome. Deepika swears by this too, since most of the times she clicks group selfies with her adoring fans.

Portray You as You!

Let your all-purpose phone speak out your personality and define you as a person.

OPPO F3

Afterall, this gadget is literally close to your heart at all times. From the external design to the internal configuration, it‚Äôs got to describe you in a second to an unknown person passing by. Whether you are an hard-core techie or a fashionista like Deepika, your phone should be able to portray you in the right light.

Customize it to speak out your mind.

OPPO F3

Since outward appearances speak out louder, customize the exterior according to what‚Äôs on your mind. Bedazzle it, hard-case it or if you don‚Äôt vouch for it, you can customize the interior too! Deepika has customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as #F3DeepikaEdition.

She has designed her own icon with OPPO, that‚Äôs etched on the back of the phone. The icon has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded on it. Sweet isn‚Äôt? The unique Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera ‚Äì one for Selfie, one for group selfie. A 16-megapixel selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

OPPO F3

Fashionistas and DP fans, want to watch the lovely Deepika talking about her #F3DeepikaEdition? Watch this video right here and book one already!"
Govt is bad at running hospitals. Let‚Äôs have Modicare instead,"In one of the most macabre and tragic incidents in recent times, 70 children died in BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur in the span of two days. The supplier allegedly cut supply of liquid oxygen after multiple unpaid bills. Many other theories are floating around too. Blame is being ascribed to the government, hospital authorities, the supplier, and some are even saying this isn‚Äôt about the oxygen shortage at all. Essentially, everyone involved has found someone to blame.

The children, however, are dead. Their families will have to live with this irreparable loss and immeasurable sorrow all their lives. Making things worse is the knowledge that this was avoidable. This happened because of one reason ‚Äî utter mismanagement, a hallmark of government-run services in India.

Those who remember the pre-cellphone era days will recall the harrowing experience in obtaining a landline connection. Government-run hotels and airlines are usually of far poorer quality than their private counterparts.

When it comes to the Indian government, one thing is clear ‚Äî it just can‚Äôt do complex services well. When the operations require constant interaction with lots of customers, quick decision-making and a certain amount of quality control, the government is simply terrible at running it.

Of course, mismanagement at MTNL meant you wouldn‚Äôt have a phone, and at Air India would mean your flight would be delayed. When things are bungled up in a hospital, you can die, en masse in this case.

The purpose of this article is not government bashing, something enough pieces have done. It is to make the government understand and accept its limitation ‚Äî it just can‚Äôt do complex services well. The reason is simple. Most government staff adopt a ‚Äòcover-their-backside‚Äô approach to work. For government employees, there is no upside for initiative, creativity or improving things. In fact, if their ideas go wrong, they will suffer for it. Hence, the typical babu‚Äôs approach is this ‚Äî do nothing new. Repeat, until retired.

This is why nobody acted on something as basic as oxygen in Gorakhpur. Ideally, the oxygen supplier should be on autopay. The hospital should also have an oxygen inventory system. Any meaningful drops should trigger an order, with automatic payments. Every hospital should have a line of credit for pre-approved emergency items. These are fairly obvious, implementable things. However, who will do this? Anybody suggesting so won‚Äôt get a raise, or a promotion or even recognition. However, if for some reason there are hiccups, the person will be blamed and punished (by perhaps a bad transfer or a stalling of his promotion). Hence, do nothing.

The bigger solution is to change this management style ‚Äî across every government entity. Our government officials need to be empowered or incentivised to improve things.

The government can also take note of its limitations. While it doesn‚Äôt do complex services well, it does run fairly decent financial institutions. Money is a simpler product to handle (than, say, liquid oxygen and life-saving medicines) and routine systems are enough to keep things going. LIC is one of India‚Äôs top insurers. A better direction for the government would be to improve India‚Äôs medical insurance, and be less involved in running hospitals. Do note that some of India‚Äôs best doctors are in government hospitals. Talent does get attracted to government jobs and they can stay. However, it is the running of the hospitals ‚Äîcleanliness, supplies, logistics and payments where the government falters. Get out of that. Insure more people. Give them a good coverage plan. Keep good doctors. And let more private players run the hospitals.

Some efforts like the Rural Health Insurance Scheme have been modestly successful, but have not transformed the medical sector. The insurance coverage given under such schemes is paltry. A new comprehensive medical insurance scheme (and it doesn‚Äôt have to be free) that offers Indian‚Äôs good medical coverage across the private and public health network may work better than the government running thousands of large hospitals. If there can be Obamacare, why not Modicare?

One also needs to relieve the excess pressure on the public health system. While some fault lies with poor management, some of what happened is due to overstretched healthcare facilities. Whether through insurance or new hospitals, we do need to spend more on healthcare (as a percentage of GDP).

Nothing can lessen the pain of the people who lost their kids. What we can hope is to learn lessons from this horrible incident and reform our healthcare system so Gorakhpur never, ever happens again."

Bangladesh cricket is not all about Mominul: Hathurusinghe

‚Ä¢ Last updated on Sat, 19 Aug, 2017, 07:46 PM Atif Azam in Dhaka

""Somebody is going to go out of the team when they are not performing,"" the Bangladesh coach said. ¬© Getty

Bangladesh head coach Chandika Hathurusinghe believes fairness was maintained during the selection of the 14-member squad for the opening game of the upcoming two-match Test series against Australia.

The omission of Mominul Haque from the opening game, first time since his debut when he was left out of the squad, looked to be the biggest talking point in the heated presser at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday (August 19). Although chief selector Minhajul Abedin tackled most of the bouncers bowled at the panel comprising of the selectors with Hathurusinghe and Habibul Bashar, the Sri Lankan did not got away unscratched.

When asked what responsibility he held as a coach for not being able to turn things around for Mominul, who appeared to be the best batsman in the longer-version, his eyes blinked in sheer disbelief. Hathurusinghe, who happens to hold a very special power in country's cricket periphery, thanks to his success, did manage to come up with a solid defence.

""As a coach, you have a responsibility,"" Hathurusinghe said. ""But the player also knows what he has to do. They are working very hard on it.

""Somebody is going to go out of the team when they are not performing. Those players not in the squad, they are still practicing. Confidence comes when we communicate with the player. There is no rule but fairness is applied for everybody,"" he said pointing out that everyone was picked factoring in their form, adding that consistency was maintained in the selection process being part of the selection committee.

""Bangladesh cricket is not all about Mominul,"" he said. ""Selection is done by consistency. Some of the guys were dropped for our last Test. I won't mention name because the team is more important.

""Consistent selection gives a lot of confidence to players who perform. We have reason to make good calls because we have been consistent on selection,"" he added.

Regarding the omission of Mahmudullah, Hathurusinghe said that he did not have much of a choice after the replacement did his job quite well in the last Test against Sri Lanka. ""The guys who played in the last game after losing the first Test came back and did well. Although the other guys are doing well in limited-overs cricket, unfortunately they have to wait for their time,"" he said. ""Good thing is we are in a rich vein of form in the last few series. Players who got dropped have to wait.

""Everyone is aware of where they stand: why they are in the team or dropped. They are working hard on what they have to do,"" he concluded.

The stain of history: Events in Charlottesville show that the legacy of slavery continues to disunite America,"America has always had a certain vanity about being a beacon of democracy and republicanism. Recent events in Charlottesville reveal that this democratic colossus has feet of clay. Clashes in the small Virginian town, near Washington DC, have been triggered by those opposing the removal of the statue of Robert E Lee, commander of the armies of the Southern states of the US who sought to perpetuate African-American slavery in the US in the 1860s. And 150 years later, the current US President Donald Trump is finding it difficult to condemn their actions, even though many of them profess neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideals. To their credit, a majority of Americans are appalled at the behavior of their president.

The enslavement of people kidnapped from Africa by the millions is a stain on American history that just won‚Äôt go away. One reason for this is the incomplete integration of the US. The American constitution formally accepted slavery till the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, a reluctant and inadvertent consequence of a war which was actually fought to keep the American Union intact, not abolish slavery. Indeed, African-Americans only got their civil rights including the right to vote in the mid 1960s, fifteen years after all Indians got them. Racism still pervades the US with white politicians, especially in the South, using all kinds of tricks to disenfranchise the poorer blacks and Hispanics.

The persistence of historical memory, leaping over decades and centuries is not, of course, unusual; there are those in India who are still fighting the battle of Haldighati and have never gotten over the disaster of the 3rd battle of Panipat. And so, this twisted American Civil War replay in Charlottesville.

Following their defeat, Southern states were under martial law and US Congress even saw some African-American legislators in the 1860s and 1870s, but then came a reversal, and they were once again condemned to the bottom of America‚Äôs social pile, along with a system of apartheid that forcibly separated the lives of black and white people till the mid 1960s.

In this period, African-Americans were lynched on the flimsiest of pretexts and white Southerners sought to recapture their racist history by honouring many of those who fought against the Union by erecting statues and naming schools and institutions after them. It‚Äôs recently that we have seen a movement to remove them.

Charlottesville is at the epicentre of this historical churning. It is a small, pleasant town with a well-known university founded by Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the US, who had estates nearby. He is the principal drafter of the American Declaration of Independence and a towering intellectual of liberal democracy. Another nearby estate belonged to George Washington, the first president of the country, and the man who led its armies to victory.

Slavery loomed much larger in their minds. For one, both used slaves to work their estates. But they were conscious that they were leading a democratic revolution as well. For that reason the word ‚Äúslavery‚Äù never figured in the American constitution, even though a fifth of the American population were African-Americans, mostly slaves. They were counted for the purpose of allocating seats in the US Congress, but needless to say they did not have the vote, leave alone liberty.

Jefferson was ambivalent about slavery, even terming it as a terrifying ‚Äúfire bell in the night.‚Äù But when he died, he simply parcelled out his slaves in his will like any property, including his own children from an African-American mistress. Washington, to his credit, freed or manumitted his slaves on his death.

The election of Donald Trump has opened these terrible wounds. Some whites continue to believe that the US is, or ought to be, a white nation, even though blacks have been there for as long as them, albeit involuntarily. They attack immigration for diluting the country‚Äôs whiteness and globalisation for the loss of jobs. Many of these angry white men are the core constituency that propelled Trump to victory."
Indian Railways is headed towards a bleak future,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a soft corner for Indian Railways. His early association with railways is well known. What is perhaps not widely known is that when he visits his parliamentary constituency, Varanasi, he opts to stay in the Railway Guest House.

‚ÄúAs the Prime Minister, I can stay somewhere else but I prefer the Railway Guest House as it gives a feel of belonging,‚Äù he told a group of railway officials last year.

This sense of belonging, however, stops short of extending support for railways in one of its most challenging phases.

A look at a parliamentary standing committee report on railways, which was finalized by BJP‚Äôs Ganesh Singh, shows that railways may have a bleak future.

For long, railways has suffered on account of incoherent policies. The incoherence in policymaking remains intact in the Modi era too.

Freight remains the mainstay of railways‚Äô revenue. Within freight, coal is the most important commodity that is moved around the country.

According to the parliamentary standing committee report, on average railways runs up a cost of Rs 0.99 per 10 kilometers but charges its customers Rs 1.60. This surplus is used to cross-subsidize passenger traffic where the average cost is Rs 0.73 per 10 kilometers against a charge of Rs 0.36.

This economic model rests on railways‚Äô being able to protect its freight business.

Last year, railways‚Äô performance in freight business was below par. Not only is it pricing itself out of business in order to meet its obligations to transport passengers, recent changes in government policy have not helped.

This is where the incoherence which characterizes economic policy makes matters worse. Power plants, which are the main consumers of coal, are now encouraged to locate themselves close to coal mines to reduce their costs. It certainly makes sense from the standpoint of a power plant, but what does it do to the railways?

Here, another recent development harms railways.

After 93 years, the railway budget was merged with the main budget this year. One of the consequences, as pointed out in standing committee report, is that operating losses incurred by railways on strategic lines and lines in hilly, coastal and backward areas will not be reimbursed to them.

This is very odd. Railways will not be allowed to conduct operations that make sense from a commercial standpoint. That is fair enough if their role is seen as something that goes beyond narrow commercial considerations. This automatically means that government should reimburse them for some of their work. However, it appears that the government is disinclined to do so which makes for a bleak future.

Prime Minister Modi should therefore consider the following suggestion from the parliamentary standing committee:

‚ÄúSufficient gross budgetary support should be provided to railways every year keeping in view their various socio-economic commitments including strategic lines.‚Äù"
"Hadiya gets a raw deal, but it is not too late to make amends","Most of us have grown up with the belief that an adult wishing to marry or embrace religion can approach the courts to surmount roadblocks placed by family and society. Perhaps, it is time to let go of the notion. The Kerala High Court and Supreme Court have implicitly introduced a new element besides informed consent and free will: the role of socio-political groups in helping such individuals convert or marry. The Supreme Court‚Äôs order directing the National Investigation Agency to probe the conversion of Hadiya, previously Akhila Asokan, and her subsequent marriage to Shefin Jahan, after the Centre told the court that a ‚Äúpattern‚Äù (based on just two other cases) seems to exist, gives grist to the ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù rumours about certain radical Muslim outfits having a vested interest in such conversions. I am not opposed to a probe on the so-called ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù but that can be taken up separately. It is important to conclusively get to the bottom of ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù so that the State can answer authoritatively to those fomenting communal tensions, whether they are aligned with extremist Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Sikh groups.

My disillusionment is with the attempt to deny an adult citizen her right to choose her faith and partner simply because some organisations and individuals with allegedly radical views are providing support to her. It has the effect of choking individual freedoms that essentially lie in the private sphere that no State must intrude into. Non-governmental organisations exist the world over to support individuals and society. Here, the organisations that are under the scanner are not brainwashing an individual to become a terrorist. What could be more peaceful than becoming religious and deciding to marry? But it is important to put this case in its correct socio-political context. One, we are living in a time when Muslim groups and conservative Muslims are insecure and are looked upon with suspicion. Two, recall that 22 Malayalis, some of them Hindu and Christian converts to Islam, took refuge with the ISIS in Afghanistan.

Take note of this paragraph from the May 2017 judgment of a division bench of the Kerala High Court that annulled Shefin‚Äôs marriage to Hadiya, sent her to live with her parents, and ordered the Kerala Police DGP to conduct a probe into the organisations that have supported Hadiya. ‚ÄúHer conduct cannot be accepted as that of a person who is possessed of her faculties. She has no idea as to what she wants in life. She appears to be under the control of someone else. It is evident that she has been indoctrinated and influenced by persons whose identities have not been ascertained.‚Äù The conduct referred to is Hadiya‚Äôs decision to marry Shefin instead of proceeding to undertake her house surgeoncy to complete her Bachelors in Homeopathy course.

However, what may have disrupted Hadiya‚Äôs education is the legal battle over her custody that is being fought by her parents since January 2016. Another bench of the high court had rejected a previous habeas corpus petition moved by Hadiya‚Äôs father in January 2016 and found that she was under no coercion. Even if Hadiya has been ‚Äúindoctrinated and influenced‚Äù it is not in the pursuit of anything illegal. But then the court notes that its interaction with Hadiya gave the judges the ‚Äúimpression that, she is only an ordinary girl of moderate intellectual capacity.‚Äù The court also felt that Hadiya did not appear to be ‚Äúcapable of taking a firm and independent decision on her own‚Äù.

It must be remembered that Hadiya is a person who finished 13 years of schooling and was on the verge of completing a bachelor‚Äôs course in a country where just 3% women are graduates. The judgment records that Hadiya chose to leave her hostel because of poor quality food and chose to live in rented accommodation with four other students in Salem, Tamil Nadu, far from her native home in Vaikom, Kerala. None of these appears to be the hallmark of a girl without intellectual capacity or ability to take firm and independent decisions. It is plausible that her marriage in between the legal proceedings without intimating the court was a calculated defiance of the court by Hadiya and those backing her for entertaining the second habeas corpus petition after another court had rejected the first petition. If a single woman‚Äôs desire to go her own way was finding no acceptance, it is hardly a surprise that the patriarchal organisations purportedly backing her suggested the option of marriage and becoming a wife to win ‚Äúsocial respect‚Äù and end the repeated intrusion.

There are technical grounds, of course, to annul the marriage. Her name is misspelt in the marriage registration documents thereby endangering her ability to claim alimony in case the marriage sours. But the judges had other problems too with the marriage. ‚ÄúIt is clear that Shafin Jahan is only a stooge who has been assigned to play the role of going through a marriage ceremony. The alleged marriage is only a sham and is of no consequence. The same was intended only to force the hands of this court and to scuttle the proceedings in this case that were progressing. The same was intended only to take Ms.Akhila out of reach of this Court and her parents.‚Äù The inference that external elements are scripting the drama is hard to miss. Elsewhere, the court notes that though Hadiya and her benefactor, a woman named Sainaba, have limited sources of income a senior advocate of the Kerala high court, S Sreekumar was representing her in the case. The court wondered where they found the means to hire such an expensive lawyer. If Muslim community groups wish to hire the best legal help to fight what they see as a prestige battle or a fight over constitutional rights, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. I would assume that the RSS and the Catholic Church would similarly defend converts to the Hindu or Catholic fold.

The court also makes this observation about Hadiya‚Äôs decision to follow Islam. ‚ÄúIn the first place, it is not normal for a young girl in her early 20s, pursuing a professional course, to abandon her studies and to set out in pursuit of learning an alien faith and religion. The normal youth is indifferent towards religion and religious studies. Though the possibility of genuine interest in the study of religion on the part of any person cannot be ruled out, such inclination is in the first place out of the ordinary. Though the alleged detenue in this case is stated to have set out to study Islam, her study has been confined to merely attending a course of two months duration conducted by the 6th respondent. She does not appear to have conducted any study thereafter.‚Äù

What qualifies judges to make such profound observations about human behaviour? Should young women abandon studies only to marry or elope with their lovers? Are religious pursuits beyond their abilities? Is a professional course everything in life? How does the court decide that normal youth are indifferent to religion and religious studies? Why should everyone be reduced to the normative? Where does it say that adopting religion requires extensive study?

When the judgment is done with questioning Hadiya‚Äôs behaviour, it turns its attention to Shefin and his criminal antecedents. It notes that Shefin is an accused in a 2013 case involving charges of Sections 143, 147, 341, 323, 294(b) read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code. It is a case of unlawful assembly and some related charges. Shefin is a member of the SDPI, a political party which fights elections, but which has been accused of following a radical Islamist agenda and whose members have been accused of conducting weapon training camps. While the rest of us may be dismayed at the existence of such parties, the fact is that radical right-wing groups hold sway among both Muslims and Hindus. For groups like SDPI their existence is a double-edged sword: if they stay out of electoral politics they are seen as subversive, but if they join the mainstream, they are seen merely as front organisations offering a political cover.

Not surprisingly, the court cites a single judge bench order of 2009 in a bail matter which called into question the alleged ‚Äúfunctioning of radical organizations pursuing activities of converting young girls of Hindu religion to Islam on the pretext of love‚Äù. Interpreting this as a fact the court says: ‚ÄúThe fact remains that such activities are going on around us in our society. Therefore, it is only appropriate that the petitioner and his wife, who are the parents, are given custody of Ms.Akhila.‚Äù Returning to Shefin, if a criminal case of unlawful assembly against a political activist would be a disqualification for marriage, 95% of Kerala‚Äôs politicians would remain bachelors.

I am a firm believer in the idea that an adult must take responsibility for his or her decisions and their outcome. Here, Hadiya, all of 24 years, and on the verge of completing her bachelors in homoeopathy has repeatedly and fervently stated that she embraced Islam with her free will and after imbibing sufficient knowledge. She has also asserted her desire to live with Shefin. But this is what Justices K Surendra Mohan and Abraham Mathew of Kerala high court writes: ‚ÄúA girl aged 24 years is weak and vulnerable, capable of being exploited in many ways. This Court exercising parens patriae jurisdiction is concerned with the welfare of a girl of her age.‚Äù The court‚Äôs ‚Äúconcern‚Äù should have ended when Hadiya spoke her mind, but the decision to annul her marriage and send her to live with her parents is not parens patriae (‚Äúparent of the nation‚Äù). Rather, it becomes an intrusion into a citizen‚Äôs private life. At 24, if a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù (not a woman yet?) is weak and vulnerable, I wonder when a woman can be strong and indestructible. Perhaps, in her ripe old age.

Despite all this talk about faith, the judgment clarifies that ‚Äúit is not our concern or attempt to decide whether Ms.Akhila should follow Islamic faith or the Hindu faith‚Äù. The judgment adds: ‚ÄúThe question of faith and religion are matters of personal conviction and this court does not consider it necessary to interfere in such matters that are personal to Ms. Akhila. However, what concerns this Court is the decision of hers that, she does not want to live with her parents.‚Äù Elsewhere the court notes the anguish of her parents. ‚ÄúThere are no other persons in this world, who would consider the welfare and well-being of their daughter to be of paramount importance than her parents. Nature provides numerous examples of even animals taking care of and protecting their progeny sacrificing their very lives for the purpose. The Homo Sapien is no exception. The forces operating from behind the curtains have succeeded in creating a hostility in the mind of Ms.Akhila towards her parents.‚Äù

The court has cited one legal precedent that recognised parental authority over even a female who has attained majority. But there would be hundreds of other judgments rejecting parental authority over majors. When the court says that ‚Äúmarriage being the most important decision in her life, can also be taken only with the active involvement of her parents‚Äù it does great disservice to generations of women who have fought hard to reclaim their agency and autonomy. Hadiya‚Äôs fight opens these closed chapters again but she must now deal with new challenges like ‚Äúnational interest‚Äù while becoming another pawn in the ongoing ‚Äúwar against terror‚Äù.

If I were a judge I would leave these beautiful lines from Kahlil Gibran‚Äôs Prophet in the poem ‚ÄúOn Children‚Äù for Hadiya‚Äôs parents.

Your children are not your children.

They are the sons and daughters of Life‚Äôs longing for itself.

They come through you but not from you,

And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts,

For they have their own thoughts.

You may house their bodies but not their souls,

For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,

which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.

You may strive to be like them,

but seek not to make them like you.

For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

In the end, let us face some hard facts about Indian families. Religious conversion and inter-caste and inter-religion marriage are stigmatised and often meet violent ends. The court may believe that it has done its paternalistic duty to ‚Äúensure the safety of at least the girls who are brought before it can be discharged only by ensuring that Ms.Akhila is in safe hands‚Äù. But the high court and the Supreme Court‚Äôs rejection of Hadiya‚Äôs testimony because of the lurking fear that it is a case of illegal conversion and love jihad disrupts cherished constitutional and human ideals like adult franchise, right to marry, and the right to adopt any religion of one‚Äôs choice. Hadiya and Shefin can claim to have got a raw deal from the courts. But it is not too late. Allow Hadiya the freedom to make her choices. Let us, as society, as courts, as police, as individual citizens, watch her and every citizen, not to judge them or intrude into their privacy, but to ensure their safety and security in a society that is turning increasingly insular and suspicious of the other."
"Meet Faketoken, A New Android Malware Which Steals Your Data From Popular Cab-Hailing Apps","Next time you hail a taxi through a smartphone app, someone may be snooping on your activity.

A new modification of notorious mobile banking Trojan ""Faketoken"" has resurfaced which is able to steal credentials from popular taxi applications and ride-sharing apps, Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab said on Friday.

Representational Image

""The new version of 'Faketoken' performs live tracking of apps and, when the user runs a specified app, overlays this with its phishing window to steal the bank card details of the victim,"" Kaspersky Lab said in a statement.

The trojan virus has an identical interface, with the same colour schemes and logos, which creates an instant and completely invisible overlay.

""The fact that cybercriminals have expanded their activities from financial applications to other areas, including taxi and ride-sharing services, means that the developers of these services may want to start paying more attention to the protection of their users,"" said Viktor Chebyshev, security expert at Kaspersky Lab.

Representational Image

""The banking industry is already familiar with fraud schemes and tricks, and its previous response involved the implementation of security technologies in apps that significantly reduced the risk of theft of critical financial data,"" Chebyshev added.

According to Kaspersky Lab, the new version of ""Faketoken"" targets mostly Russian users but they believe the geography of attacks could easily be extended in the future.

The ""Faketoken"" modification steals all incoming SMS messages by redirecting them to its command and control servers, allowing criminals to get access to one-time verification passwords sent by a bank, or other messages sent by taxi and ride-sharing services.

Representational Image

Among other things, the malware also monitor users' calls, records them and transmits the data to the command and control servers.

Kaspersky researchers have also detected 'Faketoken' attacks on other popular mobile applications, such as travel and hotel booking apps, apps for traffic fine payments, Android Pay and the Google Play Market."
Fitter Pandey returns to familiar bridesmaidshire,"PROBLEM OF PLENTY

Fitter Pandey returns to familiar bridesmaidshire

‚Ä¢ Last updated on Fri, 18 Aug, 2017, 09:36 PM Gokul Gopal in Dambulla

Pandey batted at No. 4 during his impressive 81-ball 104* against Australia in Sydney. ¬© Getty

The rain was playing hide and seek with the Indian team during their practice session at the Rangiri Dambulla International stadium, two days ahead of the first ODI of the five-match series. The multiple interruptions was an irritant, especially for Manish Pandey. Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya were the first ones to bat, taking their turns in the three different nets, facing up against pace, spin and throw-downs. The next three that occupied the nets were skipper Virat Kohli, former captain MS Dhoni and India's latest No. 4 in the upcoming ODI series - KL Rahul. Waiting for his turn, Pandey was in a sombre mood and the rain didn't make things any better for the Karnataka right-hander.

Here he was, returning from an injury break and fresh off fruitful outings in the tri-nation series in South Africa featuring the 'A' teams. Pandey was keen to impress upon Ravi Shastri and the rest of the team-management that he was back and raring to go. The order that India followed while batting in the nets, more or less, summed up the potential batting order for the opening ODI. Dhawan and Rohit opening, Kohli at No. 3 and Rahul at 4. With Dhoni and Pandya slotted down, only one spot was remaining - No. 5.

That position appeared a direct toss up between Pandey, Ajinkya Rahane and Kedar Jadhav - who were the last set of batsmen to hit the nets on Friday (August 18). Rahane, the highest run-getter for India in the ODI series in the West Indies, appeared compact in the nets facing up against the pacers. Jadhav had his fair share of hits and misses against the spinners, and appeared to be enjoying his light-hearted banter with Yuzvendra Chahal.

Pandey, meanwhile, displayed a varied hue of emotions facing up against the slingy bullets from throw-down specialist - Raghavindraa. He grimaced whenever he missed the short deliveries outside-off, admonishing himself for every nick and miss, but at the same time oozed confidence driving on the up and flicking with disdain the deliveries that were strayed. All the while, Shastri was having a keen look at what was going on, focusing his attention on Pandey while keeping an eye on the rest batting in the two other nets. What was going through his mind, and through the minds of the ones literally batting for one spot?

More than a year back, an innings of 104 not-out against Australia brought Pandey into the spotlight. Leading his side over the line in a chase of 331, showcasing a steely nerve in a trying situation, Pandey's stocks rose as India had unearthed a player who would take up the No. 4 mantle. But a below-par series against New Zealand at home, batting lower down the order, resulted in Pandey no longer remaining part of the pecking order, and a side strain later putting paid to his Champions Trophy hopes.

""It's (injuries) really tough. Sometimes, when you are not in form it doesn't really hurt as much as when you're doing well and suddenly get injured. But I think you take it in the stride and that's the time when you get to learn what's the weak part of your body and where you have to work. I had enough time, about six weeks, to work on myself and a couple of things I had to do. It was good for me in a way but yeah, obviously a little disappointed about the time it happened but it's always good to come back. I had a good India A series; the team did really well, so I'm pretty happy.

""Honestly, I've waited a long time to come to the Indian side that I'm used to it now. IPL was going good for me - 10 games, about 400 runs - and then I missed those crucial two games. But it's part of the game, that's what you do (wait for your opportunity) and I've played the waiting game really well so far and it's okay for me. Whatever the management decides on the batting order, we would go with it,"" he adds.

With Rahul confirmed as the No. 4 batsman for the ODIs, Pandey will have to manage with whatever spot he's asked to bat at, only if he gets the nod ahead of Jadhav who can also offer his bits with the ball. Having batted at the No. 4 position for most parts of his career, an adjustment is the need of the hour for Pandey to stay relevant to the requirements of the Indian team, let alone cement a spot.

""The game I played in Australia, I batted No.4, that's where I normally bat, and that's where I know how many overs I have to play. That's where I have batted my entire career. Batting at No. 6 or No. 5 was a bit new for me during the New Zealand series, and I think it took me some time to get used to that situation with only 15-odd overs left in the game. You can't settle in from that position, you just need to go out and go at everything from ball one. I think I have adapted to that situation well. Let's see how it goes,"" says Pandey, reflecting on where things went downhill.

""That's where I bat (at No. 4), the middle-order. That's somewhere I have been batting for long time. But if the team thinks somebody else can do that role really well - KL has been batting really well in Tests - I would love to see that happen. It does change the middle order a little bit but that's just one or two changes. We agree with what the management has to say. We abide by that,"" he says, while remaining hopeful of getting a spot.

Waiting on the sidelines isn't anything new to Pandey, who's willing to go through the grind all over again. But being in the selectors' radar and getting sufficient time during practice sessions with the Indian team is proof of the confidence that the team has in the 27-year-old. How he repays the faith is a story that is yet to unfold.

"The king is dead, long live the king","Infosys is going through an internal convulsion, beating down its stock and contributing to the fall of the overall market index. When a palace coup happens, who falls and who rises is a matter of vital interest to a small number of people who form the dramatis personae. For the country as a whole, what matters, once shedding a ceremonial tear for the fallen and hailing the victor are done, is that whoever is the new ruler should keep the country stable and improve the quality of governance. The same principle applies to Infosys.

It is natural for Infosys insiders to work up a passion over the rights and wrongs of Narayana Murthy‚Äôs constant sniping at Vishal Sikka and Sikka‚Äôs failure to counter that guerrilla action, leading to his eventual ouster. For investors in the company and for the rest of the information technology sector, what matters is that the transformation in the business model initiated by Sikka, leading to steady rise in revenue per employee, should continue. The information technology sector is ripe for disruption. It must adapt to the new environment in which automation and artificial intelligence would take over a lot of the customary work done by legions of coders.

Instead of falling victim, India‚Äôs information technology needs to drive the change. Vishal Sikka and the current Infosys board that supported him recognised the challenge and set in motion a process of change. This is all to the good. But the process of change has been accompanied by a cultural clash, between austere conservatism and expensive flamboyance, which has led to much heartburn among the old guard.

Their backlash has been strong enough to oust the torchbearer of change. Whoever comes in next would have to be culturally more compatible but no less insistent on the need for change than Sikka has been.

Narayana Murthy‚Äôs return from corporate self-exile to activism raises serious questions. Should a founder retire at all, unless other shareholders find him a hindrance to growth? Having handed over the wheel to someone else, why do backseat driving? But the real challenge is to keep Infosys growing and evolving."

"Blue whales and other folk tales: We, the middle class are as susceptible to urban legends as anyone else","It started last May, with a series of clickbaity stories on the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. They described the bizarre Blue Whale challenge as an online game that preyed on teens, with a moderator giving each participant a set of escalating challenges, eventually leading to suicide. The British tabloids ran with it next, and soon, solicitous police departments were warning parents. From Brazil to India, by now the Blue Whale story has been heard around the world.

And yet, hardly anyone has direct knowledge of the subculture. Forums discussing suicide are not alien to the internet, but there‚Äôs a fog of facts around the Blue Whale bogey. A 21-year-old Russian man called Philipp Budeikin was arrested for masterminding the game on the basis of one wild, braggy interview. Many of the first claims have been deflated. The estimated number of suicides has swung wildly, from 130 to ‚Äúat least 16‚Äù. In many countries, including Russia, the original story has been undercut, but to no avail.

The lurid appeal of Blue Whale is just too great, as is the number of media outlets prepared to swallow it whole, the array of experts willing to speculate without facts, the majority of adults convinced that kids are up to dumb, dangerous things, and malign forces roam the internet.

The journalist Anne Collier, who works on young people and digital safety, has tried to put Blue Whale in perspective. In Russia, tens of thousands of bots were found using those hashtags. There were a few seeming followers, and the rest looked it up out of curiosity, or were advertisers trying to promote something, and ‚Äúprofessionals testing technologies for information dissemination‚Äù.

Radio Free Europe tried to find suicides linked to Blue Whale, and came up empty. The fact-checking site Snopes went at it too, and found no conclusive evidence of Blue Whale, in specific, goading teens to suicide. Bulgaria‚Äôs Safer Internet Centre, which empirically studies teen digital behaviour, pointed out that given that Russia has among the highest teen suicides in the world anyway, it would be hard to prove that this weird internet subculture actually caused the deaths.

In other words, we‚Äôve all been had, and how. Even one teen death is one too many, but to get agitated about Blue Whale instead of noticing signs of mental trouble, is irresponsible. The danger with spreading such sensationalist stories about death cults and copycat suicides is always this: it triggers real tragedy, because a few vulnerable individuals get swept up in the contagion.

Look up stories about the ‚Äúsuicide town‚Äù of Bridgend, or the Slender Man meme about a tall thin supernatural killer that swept the US a few years ago. With Slender Man, what started as a tale told around a campfire became a networked horror story. Folklorists studied the scale and velocity of the myth, as people recounted the phenomenon, added their two-bit and their FOAF (friend-of-a-friend) accounts, shared creepy visuals as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù. Eventually, it led to a real stabbing.

Technology has always been blamed for driving teens round the bend. Decades ago, there was a similar moral panic around the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, which was blamed for suicide and demon worship. Violent videogames were held out as the reason for mass killings like Columbine. While excessive focus on anything, whether workaholism or exercise or Netflix, should be a sign of mental distress, that‚Äôs not to say that these activities cause the mental distress and its violent manifestations.

Of course, in India, even urban legends are divided by class. People like us deplored the ‚Äúmass hysteria‚Äù that drove folks in UP and Haryana to believe women‚Äôs braids were being chopped off by mysterious forces, even as we solemnly appealed to the grownups in government to tackle the ‚ÄúBlue Whale‚Äù problem. Even a presumably rational communist like Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to Prime Minister Modi to do something, anything. The IT ministry declared the game ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù and ordered social platforms to scour their content.

The whole point about a moral panic is not whether the story is true or false. The question is, what is the standard used to call it an ‚Äòepidemic‚Äô? One person, or ten, or hundred, or more? Usually, a small or stray ‚Äòactual‚Äô incident is made into a gripping narrative, one that stokes genuine social anxieties. Media may be a big part of these moral panics, where attention builds, peaks and then falls off just as suddenly. It‚Äôs happening with the braid chopping story, and will inevitably happen with Blue Whale too.

A moral panic is a dramatic production that involves several actors ‚Äî there‚Äôs always a ‚Äòfolk devil‚Äô or scapegoat (in this case, the internet), there are law enforcers, media, politicians and the public who all play their part. New technology often sets off moral panics ‚Äì from electricity to the telephone to social media, each new thing has made us freak out about the fraying social fabric.

And yet, no technology actually turns anyone‚Äôs head, it only makes it easier to do what they were doing anyway. Our protective posture towards young people, our sense of their suggestibility, guilt about not having given them enough attention, our discomfort with their growing autonomy, all combine to let us readily believe such ‚Äòtrends among the youth‚Äô stories.

Falling for such narratives is not a failing or an embarrassment, it‚Äôs the human default. But perhaps knowing that we are all suckers for a sensational story should make us a little humbler, a little less quick to judge others who do the same."
Sreesanth Reveals Why He Tucked In A Towel While Bowling In The Indian Premier League 2013,"Things are currently looking up for tainted pacer S Sreesanth, who was given some hope of returning to cricket by the Kerala High Court. The court asked the BCCI to lift the cricket ban on him.

But back in 2013, one night changed the course of his life. He was pulled up on charges of match-fixing and it was widely reported that was Sreesanth's signal to bookies was tucking in a towel in his pants.

Twitter

But Sreesanth now has a different story. In an interview with Wisden, he explains why he tucked in the towel.

""They said Jiju (Janardhan) apparently said I would either keep an armband or towel or vermilion or something like that. I used to do all that because I love Allan Donald.‚Äù

Twitter

‚ÄúI have done that before too. I would even wear plenty of zinc oxide on my face, like Donald. Does that mean those matches were fixed too? Is it a crime to be superstitious? I believed that wearing those things would help me when I was going through a bad phase in my bowling. In fact, in the first over I asked Kumar Dharmasena (the umpire) if it was okay if I kept a towel. Surely, the stump microphones picked that up. I did that only because it made me feel like Donald.‚Äù

As of now, Sreesanth is looking forward to representing India in the 2019 World Cup."

With the recent health awakening of the world, it almost seems like everyone wants to know what they are eating, the calorie intake, the protein intake and other rudiments associated with it. In this rush, people often forget how they're being conned by big brands or social coercion.

Lucy's website is all about comparing foods and doing a visual food comparisons to prove her point.

1. Check out the calorie similarities between a hand full of almonds and fruit pastels.

Both snacks have the same calories. Which one would you pick?‚†Ä ‚†Ä

""Many would choose the almonds for the nutritional value or the flavour - which is totally fine. Many would choose the almonds because even though they'd prefer Fruit Pastels, almonds would make them feel more ‚Äòon track‚Äô mentally - which again, is totally fine "" she wrote, explaining the difference.

""When the majority of my diet has consisted of well-balanced food that‚Äôs full of micronutrients, I have no issue eating something that‚Äôs less so just because I love the taste of it.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me wrong; dried fruit is waaaay easier to eat when you‚Äôre on the go (ain‚Äôt nobody got time to whip out a punnet of strawberries lol).

Infosys‚Äôs driverless golf cart versus Google‚Äôs autonomous vehicles: How can India become a global technology innovation hotspot?,"On July 14, 2017, Infosys unveiled its driverless golf cart designed and built by its engineering service team at its Mysuru campus. In contrast, by June 2016, eight years since its inception, Google‚Äôs fleet of autonomous vehicles had been driven for 28 lakh kilometers. In 2015, Google completed its first driverless ride on public roads, giving ride to a sole blind man in Austin, Texas (Wikipedia). Take another case. In April 2016, Infosys unveiled its Artificial Intelligence platform MANA. However, the first major demonstration of a similar SAP product HANA was in 2008. Can Infosys ever match up to Google‚Äôs autonomous vehicles given that it started 8 years too late? Or, can it ever beat SAP in launching a new product? In fact, breakthrough technology innovation is consistently taking place, for example, hyperloop transport, 100 MW lithium ion battery for solar PV storage, magnetically levitated trains running at over 600 km/h, wireless car battery charging, hot solar cells, practical quantum computers, paralysis reversal implants; the list goes on and on. India is far removed from the global technology innovation ecosphere. Even China is far ahead of India in technology development in manifold spheres such as advanced biometric techniques, high speed trains, military hardware, and even the traditional steel and aluminium plants. If Infosys, a progressive, cash-rich company, with enormous global exposure cannot anticipate technology direction and plays the catch-up game in product development, it is time for serious introspection about the vision and methodology of our research and development (R&D). Thus, the big question: How do we make India a global technology innovation hotspot?

Lack of technology vision has been a major impediment in Indian product development. Take the case of information technology (IT). By the late 1990s, it was abundantly clear that IT-integrated hardware would be an essential part of our life, be it communication devices, transportation, consumer appliances, shopping, and entertainment. Thus, transition from manual to automatic transmission to cruise control to driver-less vehicles (DLVs) was a natural progression. Cloud computing was expected to be a natural corollary of the internet era but you will not find Infosys/TCS/Wipro ranked among the ten best global companies. Artificial intelligence is expected to run devices and businesses more efficiently, but here too we arrived late to the party. Similarly, clean technologies and renewable energy should have been a priority area for the manufacturing industry much earlier.

We need industry leaders with the courage to take a leap of faith like Elon Musk who came up with the audaciously ambitious concept of hyperloop transport, which successfully completed its first full-scale test in May. India could have had its Elon Musk moment with driverless cars? The sensors used in navigating a DLV through traffic such as LiDAR, camera, radar, actuators were available before 2008. We had the expertise to integrate the data from sensors into a software, which would then control the motion of the DLV based on the traffic around it. Clearly a company such as TCS/Infosys could have developed a proof of concept DLV before Google. So what if the DLV was expensive and looked clunky, at least TCS/Infosys would have enough lead time to refine the DLV technology and challenge the hegemony of Google. Similarly, Mukesh Ambani has the resources to conceive and implement out-of-the-world ideas such as the space tourism capsule by Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos or develop innovative solar energy and carbon capture and sequestration technologies like ExxonMobil. Unfortunately, Reliance Industries Ltd has no major technology innovation on offer, Reliance Jio being only a business model disruptor.

Emphasis on value added products and reverse engineering are two ways of countering entrenched global companies. Low costs are simply not enough as the generics-centered Indian pharmaceutical is finding out. An example in the change in mind-set is from Dr. Reddy‚Äôs Laboratories Ltd, which ‚Äúrather than simply copy Glaxo‚Äôs migraine medication Imitrex, tweaked the formula to make it act faster at smaller doses (www.livemint.com).‚Äù The Indian steel industry is also shifting its focus towards special steels for high speed trains, nuclear and automobile industries. In many such cases, strategic foreign collaboration is required. And, this is where reverse engineering comes in. Learning the intricacies of the production process of and then leveraging this knowledge for developing innovative new products is the way forward, as China has done so successfully over the years.

Successful commercialization of new products requires an integrated approach. That is, a new product must be backed by appropriate infrastructural ‚Äî software and hardware ‚Äî support. Despite the concern for environment, electric cars will never be a success unless it is backed by facilities for superfast battery charging or charging on the go, as in wireless charging.

Finally, there must be a fundamental shift in our approach towards research and product development. Is it worth expending significant R&D in non-strategic products where the chances of being a global leader are remote? Take the example of automobile engines. Taxi owners will tell you that a Toyota Etios can run for more than 300,000 km without any major tinkering with the engine. The corresponding number for a Tata Indigo is about 100,000 km. Consequently, why should we even bother about significant R&D in automobile engines especially when such technologies can be readily bought off-the-shelf. Instead, we should follow a composite approach for R&D: (i) value-addition in existing products/technologies to increase energy efficiency and lower costs and (ii) focus firmly on technologies of tomorrow such as batteries, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and 3-D printing."

No More Complicated Guesswork: This App Can Definitely Tell If Your Partner Is Cheating On You!,"In the times when everything is digital, even finding a date can be just as easy as finding a recipe of your favourite dish.

Look at apps like Tinder, for example, which let you can swipe through potential conquests to your heart's content and your partner will never know.

But if you've been using Tinder whilst in a relationship, whether to physically cheat on your partner or just have a few swipes to see if you've still got what it takes to play the game, you could be in trouble.

According to The Independent, a new app named Swipebuster allows you to search for someone on Tinder and see when they last swiped. One can possibly tell their partner that they just did not deleted their profile, but this app takes care of that too.

This app will also show when someone was last active on the dating app.

Representational Image

Swipebuster costs about Rs 500 for three searches and all you have to do is put in the first name, age and likely location of your suspect. The app insists that it only presents information that is public on Tinder.

No more cheating and getting away with it, folks. Beware! So best not to even think about it, no matter how smart you think you are."

Did You Know That According To Science The Best Way To Drink Whiskey Is To Dilute It With Water?,"A religious whiskey drinker may insist having his drink on the rocks or with a dash of water added to it. Well, it turns out there‚Äôs good reason for that and it's one that now even science backs.

alkotraz.ru

Researchers at the Linnaeus University in Sweden carried out a test to examine how compounds such as guaiacol in whiskey moved around with the presence of water in it.

They concurred that adding water to your drink frees guaiacol from its entrapments and enhances its smell and taste!

The flavour in whiskey comes from the molecule called guaiacol, which is what gives whiskey its smoky, spicy and peaty flavour. It resembles other compounds such as vanillin (a compound that tastes like vanilla).

The study published in the journal Scientific Reports was conducted to simulate what happens to guaiacol in different concentrations of water.

Since water and ethanol don't mix that well drinks contain clusters of ethanol, which trap aromatic compounds such as guaiacol, hampering what the drink should ideally taste like.

Whisky is distilled at concentrations of alcohol above 59 percent. But whiskeys like Jack Daniels come bottled at a dilution of 40 to 45 percent where the ethanol and guaiacol accumulate at the surface.

Diluting it to around 27 percent overall alcohol by adding a dash of water allows the guaiacol to ‚Äòaerosolize‚Äô and dispersed away from the surface, which allows the fragrant compounds to waft into your nose and keep your spirits high and holding on to your favourite drink!

Since the taste, smell and flavour of your drink go hand-in-hand and the fact that the right amount of water is what is needed to enhance the flavour, it makes you wonder why whiskey isn‚Äôt manufactured at lower concentrations?

It‚Äôs Sunny in Kochi: Could Leone be the neta we need?,"When Sunny Leone, actress and former porn star, showed up in Kochi to inaugurate a phone showroom, she drew an absurdly huge crowd. Students bunked college to come and gawk, men piled atop hoardings and buses to catch a glimpse. It was a surging sea of testosterone. Malayali men bitterly divided in their politics and beliefs came together, united in their feelings for Leone.

Sunny should run for public office. She shows us a different way of being, one where sexuality is not shameful and repressed, where women comfortably occupy their bodies and spirits without insecurity or apology. Millions of Indian men only know female sexuality in two dimensions, from videos or images, and she blows their mind with her actual humanity. She radiates self-acceptance. In public appearance, she is gracious, but also funny and cheeky, she politely shows sexist interviewers their place, and gets on with her life.

Many of the men who came to look at her may be incapable of mentioning her without a bawdy joke. But the joke‚Äôs really on them, for not being able to reconcile their own desire with respect, not being able to truly look a woman in the eye. So if Leone, aka Karenjit Kaur Vohra, were to join politics, she would be leered at, certainly. But she would also give us a glimpse of freedom and autonomy and choice, where women are not objects and vessels of group honour, but full individuals."

Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.
