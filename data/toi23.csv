What ails our Temples of Health?,"The deaths of children on account of the Japanese Encephalitis Virus at the Gorakhpur Medical College is completely unacceptable and I share the anguish of every citizen of our country on these man made errors.

But as always happens, it is only a matter of time before our activist press members will find something new to cover, our politicians will get busy with new challenges and our doctors, who are responsible for these deaths every year will breathe a sigh of relief as the spotlight will shift from them.

Japanese Encephalitis is an infection of the brain caused by the mosquito borne Japanese encephalitis virus. This virus makes its annual appearance during the period July – September months in Gorakhpur district and neighbourhood areas. The fatalities in the last few years are as follows:

1. 2012: 557

2. 2013: 650.

3. 2014: 525

4. 2015: 491

5. 2016: 641

6. 2017: 100, so far

What is important for the authorities is to ensure that they must not allow the deaths of these children to become an annual affair that needs to be justified and shouted about for a short period of time because it gets attention and it gets media coverage, only to go back to status quo ante when the noise recedes. Proactive steps need to be taken from vaccination to cleanliness to substantial improvement of the facilities and infrastructure at these government-owned medical institutions.

It is time for us to take stock of the state of our medical colleges not just in Gorakhpur or the state of Uttar Pradesh but in the entire country. Have we ever wondered why it is always the poor who suffer? Probably because they are the only people who have to seek medical help in government owned medical colleges, civil hospitals or primary health centres.

Has a journalist ever made a surprise visit to any of these hospitals and seen the pathetic state of the hospitals and even the Intensive Care units? They would be shocked to see that it is quite common to experience a big shortage of ICU beds and to see patients lying on the floor with their relatives holding up the drip connected to their bodies because there is no equipment even to hold the bottle of saline or the bag of blood.

In addition to the unsanitary conditions in our temples of health, it is quite common to see stray dogs, monkeys and rats everywhere in the hospital.

Have we looked at the pathetic state of waiting areas for patients in government owned medical colleges? In summer, patients sit in the intense heat with no provision of water. In monsoons, there is no covered area outside and in winter, they have to brave the bone chilling winter of North India.

Patients come from villages spread hundreds of kilometers around the medical colleges and they have no idea how long they may have to wait to get an appointment. At the same time, have we seen how easily it is for VIP’s to not only get immediate attention and the best medicines but also the best rooms while everyone else is struggling to find a place on the floor in the hospital to sit or to lie down?

Government doctors are happily operating their private practices from their homes and no one bothers to enforce the rule that government doctors are not permitted to have a private practice. In several states, there is a new term called “propaganda medicine” that has evolved over a period of time. There are specialist doctors in several medical colleges who have now taken control of the entire value chain from prescription to purchase. These doctors write the prescription, manufacture the medicines that they prescribe in partnership with someone and they have even set up a chemist shop where these medicines are exclusively available.

Have we looked at the availability of medicines in government hospitals, which under most state laws are supposed to be given free of charge to people in the economically weaker sections of society? These medicines are supplied to these medical college shops by the Government and are prescribed by the doctors. More often than not, these medicines are not available. It is the norm that when a poor patient takes the prescription to the shop, he is told that medicines are out of stock. In the same breath, the pharmacist at the store tells the patient that he should walk across the road and go to the private chemist on the other side of the road where all these medicines are easily available, albeit at a cost.

Where are the medicines that were procured by the Government and supplied to these medical colleges? Why are they not available in the hospital stores? Has anyone bothered to investigate this or is this news not “breaking” enough for people to sit up and take notice?

In order to prevent theft and re-sale of government procured medicines, a simple solution is available. All medicines procured by the government for distribution free of charge should be packaged not in a silver strip but in a black foil strip with the medicine name and ingredients printed clearly across the strip in red. The medicine strips should also clearly state that these medicines are distributed free of charge and if anyone is found to be selling these medicines, severe and exemplary action will be taken. This is a very simple solution to solve the problem but may not be economically beneficial to the procurement officials.

The poor people face challenges all the time. There are chemists who have shops outside medical colleges and they specialise in supply of medicines for illnesses – where a patient is unlikely to recover – such as cancer. These chemists sit with a lawyer who specialises in land title deeds and they take away the land of the poor people in exchange for medicines that the patient needs. Can there really be any other trade worse than this?

We need some serious introspection on the condition of all government owned health institutions in our country and the service they provide for the poor and the masses of our nation for whom they were really setup. Governments come and governments go. Some lip-sync their concerns and sympathy a little more than the others but most of them have done nothing even after seven decades of our independence.

Only when we start going to the grass root of the problems will we be able to start fixing the institutions of health that serve the people. Accountability has to be sought and discipline must be enforced. Otherwise every year there will be an outbreak of encephalitis and every year we will express our shock only to forget about the outbreak till the next epidemic strikes.

It is impossible to get anything done overnight but a beginning has to be made."
"In his first big foreign policy speech, President Trump slams Pakistan","In the most direct speech ever from a world leader, President Trump rebuked Pakistan for housing terror groups. On the 21st of August, 2017, speaking to the armed forces in Fort Myers, Virginia, President Trump spoke about his Afghanistan -South Asia strategy. He was candid, direct about how he had asked his cabinet to come up with a strategy on Afghanistan and then had made his decision.

“No nation building anymore,” he said, “we are killing terrorists.” And assured the forces that there would not be micromanagement from Washington and strategic decisions would be made on the ground. This time America would fight to win.

President Trump regretted that the war in Afghanistan was in its 17 years and the blood and treasure had been enormous but he said he owed it to the soldiers who had fought and died to finish what they had gone for—killing terrorists in their safe havens and not letting a vacuum develop as in Iraq and in Afghanistan by hastily withdrawing troops.

On the issue of Islamic terrorism, Trump, has not wavered once. He spoke about it candidly in Saudi Arabia; wanted to extreme vet immigrants coming from countries that were considered to be harbouring terrorists; and has nailed Afghanistan and Pakistan as countries that have 20 US designated foreign terrorist organizations. This has made the security threat from this region immense. Therefore, America would have to after the terrorists.

“For its part Pakistan often gives safe havens for agents of chaos, violence and terror,” he said and he was committed to stripping terrorists of their territory and cutting of their funding. Calling them thugs, criminals, predators and losers he declared that we will defeat them handily.

This could imply that US troops would no longer be constrained to chase the Haqqani network into safe havens in Pakistan and that even terror groups in Pakistan would come under the radar to be destroyed.

President Trump said that a pillar of the new strategy is how to change the approach to deal with Pakistan. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations; the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond.”

It had much to lose by harbouring criminals, terrorists. He said that though Pakistan had been a partner in the past it had sheltered the same organizations “that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars, at the same time, they are housing the terrorists that we are fighting!”.

“But that will have to change and that will change immediately. No partnership can survive a county’s harbouring of militants and terrorists that target US servicemen. Time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order and to peace.”

President Trump said that another critical part of the strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India- “the world’s largest democracy and the key security and economic partner of the US.”

This will definitely send a strong signal to both Pakistan and China that the US is firmly behind India. No longer is Pakistan going to be able to hold a gun to America’s head and say, “we will implode if you don’t pay us,” or “ we are a victim of terror.”

China too, indirectly, has been put on notice. Perhaps, they will realize that they can’t side with Pakistan indefinitely on terror. Their huge stakes in CPEC could also be at stake.

President Trump also said that the NATO allies have contributed and will continue to contribute towards fighting terror.

He was firm that there would be no blank checks and Afghanistan would have to commit to share the burden, to reform and play its part in the effort to stabilize itself.

Since President Trump came to office, I have written about the times his administration has chided Pakistan and foretold that he would be good for India. He has not disappointed me yet."
This 3200MP Camera In World's Most Hi-Tech Telescope Will Start Hunting For Dark Matter In 2019,"Ever since astronomers discovered in 1998 that our universe is expanding faster as time goes by the idea has captivated researchers across the world. The idea is that this acceleration in the rate it’s expanding because of “dark energy”, the mysterious gravitational force spread throughout our universe.

A concept render of what the LSST facility will eventually look like

Now, scientists from dozens of institutions across 23 countries have come together to work on a new telescope they believe can shed light on dark matter. Called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), it’s a gigantic digital camera to be mounted on Earth, which will capture images from galaxies millions of light years away.

“All the existing telescopes with cameras were built before the discovery of dark energy,” Paul O’Connor, a senior scientist from Brookhaven National Laboratory told Atlas Obscura. “We expect the LSST to map the entire sky and find out where all that dark matter has been hiding.” O’Connor has been working on the project for over ten years and he believes it could completely change how we understand the workings of the universe.

The LSST's 3.5 metre wide mirror cells, part of its camera assembly

The LSST would serve to capture images of galaxies much further away than our current technology allows. The camera’s field of view when pointed at the sky would be just ten square degrees, but it would still be able to spot around a million distant galaxies in that area. It'll also be outfitted with a 3,200 megapixel sensor being developed by O'Connor at Brookhaven, able to capture light from stars 100 million times dimmer than those visible to the naked eye.

About the size of a small SUV car, ""the LSST camera is the largest camera ever constructed for astronomy.""

It is a large-aperture, wide-field optical camera that is capable of viewing light from the near ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths. It's 3 metre long, 1.65 metre high, weighs 2800 kg, and has a pixel count of 3200 megapixel -- several times better, more precise than even the best smartphone cameras out there.

When the LSST begins operations in 2020, in the mountains of Chile, it will be tasked with scanning regions of the sky over and over for the next 10 years. It’s expected to capture each patch of sky a thousand times, over the course of 3,000 nights. “We’re really going to be making a movie of the universe,” O’Connor said.

The camera assembly of the LSST compared with a human

With that data, astronomers hope to better understand dark energy by looking at how it interacts with objects in the universe. Studying how these far-flung galaxies are shooting away from us could bring new discoveries in the field of astrophysics that we’ve never even thought

"Why People, Who Swear, Stay Up Late And Tend To Be Messy Are Deemed More Intelligent","If you’ve always been called out for living out of a messy room, have a dirty tongue and tend to stay up longer than most people you know, you might be better off than your parents or well wishers ever thought. You may actually be smarter than them!

magazinaisle.com

We don’t just want to make you feel better for your seemingly ‘destructive’ qualities (or so you’ve told most of your life), but because science indicates that all these qualities are a sign of higher IQ levels.

Swearing is a sign of rhetorical ability

blog.4psa.com

People often think that swearing indicates a weakness in your vocabulary. The logical assumption being that if you swear a lot you probably don’t know how to construct your thoughts using a whole lot more words. But a study published in Science Direct that those who use the maximum number of swear words within a minute scored higher on an IQ test. The test was indicative of the fact that a rich vocabulary of swear words equated strong rhetoric ability and not a compensation for a lack of vocabulary.

If you have a messy setting, chances are you are more creative

botasot.info

So you’ve been accused of leaving a messy desk/room behind all your life? Well, the chance that you're more creative and a genius in comparison to your prim and proper counterparts is much higher. A study conducted by the University of Minnesota concluded that if you’re not spending too much time cleaning and organising your settings your mind is obviously preoccupied with thoughts that are more important. The researchers claimed that it led to better creative output.

Being a night owl has long been linked with intelligence

If you prefer staying up late chances are you fit within the intellectually brighter lot of people that history has witnessed. Research such as this one in Psychology Today reveals that night owls are linked to higher IQ levels as compared to morning larks. People like J.R.R. Tolkien, Pharrell Williams, Mark Zuckerberg, Charles Darwin and President Obama were nocturnal beings.

"In Case You Missed It, Here Are Some Of The Most Dramatic Pictures From The Solar Eclipse","The magnificent eclipse from yesterday has, for sure, left the entire world in awe. As the moon's shadow slowly took over areas that fall around Oregon and South Carolina, everyone began basking in the glorious eclipse, touted to be one of the harshest.

For over an hour and a half, everyone took a break from whatever they were doing and took it to the streets with their gears on. Millions got outside to watch this eclipse and even a million more witness it online, making it one of the most-watched in history.

nasa

The eclipse was partially visible across all 50 states, but it was the clearest from a 70-mile-wide sliver of 14 states. This eclipse was a totality, a rare event that hasn't happened since 1979 and a coast-to-coast eclipse for almost over a century.

108-kg Actress Refuses To Gain More Weight For TV Show,"Actress Anjali Anand, who currently weighs 108 kg, has refused to put on more weight for her role of an oversized girl in the upcoming TV show ""Dhhai Kilo Prem"".

Anjali, who is making her acting debut with the show, was asked by makers to put on more weight. However, she refused to do so.

""I have lived a very active life all this while. Being someone who loves to trek and cycle to maintain a steady weight, gaining too much weight is a big no-no. I am at 108 kg for the role and any more change might get difficult to reverse,"" Anjali said in a statement.

""Dhhai Kilo Prem"", which will be aired on Star Plus starting from April 3, is an unusual story of two imperfect individuals -- Deepika and Piyush (Meherzan Mazda).

"Vegetarians Not Vegetarian Anymore? Turns Out, Plants Knew All Along They Were Being Eaten","Well, we all know that vegetarians take a lot of pride in the food they eat. They leave no stone unturned when it comes to giving a shit for eating meat as if it's a crime and as if the animals knows they are being eaten.

Well hey vegetarians, in your face because plants know it too.

Leaf&wood

A new research shows that plants know when they're being eaten and they don't like it when you do that. According to o Modern Farmer, a new study conducted by researchers at the University of Missouri claims that all the plants possess some sort of intelligence and know it when you're approaching them to put them in your mouth.

They even send out defence mechanisms to try to stop you from doing that. The study was carried out on thale cress, which is closely related to broccoli, kale, mustard greens, and other members of the family. They are commonly used for experiments because they have genome sequenced, and scientists are intimately familiar with how it works.

vegetables

Researchers took audio recordings to understand vibrations a plant does when it's being eaten. They studied these vibration patterns, that released another shake like wind noise.

Modern Farmer claims ""the thale cress produces mustard oils that are mildly toxic when eaten and sends them throughout its leaves to try to keep the predators away.""

""Previous research has investigated how plants respond to acoustic energy, including music,"" said Heidi Appel, senior research scientist in the Division of Plant Sciences in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources and the Bond Life Sciences Center at MU.

""However, our work is the first example of how plants respond to an ecologically relevant vibration. We found that feeding vibrations signal changes in the plant cells' metabolism, creating more defensive chemicals that can repel attacks from caterpillars,"" he added.

Worship Is Work,"Does God favour those who attend to their work in factories and offices, or those who sit for long in puja, wonder UMA RAM and K S RAM



Afavourite home-assignment for pupils in schools till some decades ago was to write an essay on ‘Work is Worship’. The teacher made the task easy by describing the contours of the essay:True worship lies in doing work.We should work hard.We should not waste time in idle (idol?) worship.She almost suggested that God favours those who bend their backs and attend to their work in the factories and offices,rather than those who sit for long in puja. Few of us (including the teachers who set the assignment) ever suspected the politics that went into this seemingly simple exercise. Few of us could have suspected that it was part of the Macaulian manipulation of education in India that aimed to produce an army of ever-ready servants for the government. In a land known for sedentary ways of life revolving around stretched pujas and innumerable special days for festive duty and special service, such spiritual re-engineering was necessary for developing human resources to uphold the Raj. There is probably nothing in our scriptures or in the scriptures of any major religion anywhere to support the idea that work is worship. In fact, there is good evidence to suggest the opposite: that worship is work in the real sense.Krishna describes this in his discourse on action and inaction.



‘He who sees action in inaction and inaction in action truly sees, he tells Arjuna. Sarva’rambha parityaga, renouncement of all initiatives is declared a virtue in one who is coursing ahead on the spiritual highway. Let life unfold itself and do with disinterested diligence the tasks that such unfolding presents for you. Religion began as magic.It,in fact, continues to be so. An incense stick waved around a symbol of godhead is essentially an act of waving the magic wand for a good day ahead.The day unfolds the will of God. Work presents itself and it is perfectly in order to perform it to the best of one’s ability as service in the will of God.To initiate work, or to avoid the task that has presented itself before you would mean meddling with God’s action plan. He knows, we don’t.To surrender to his action plan is true work. Work, as we understand it, is the elaborate, tedious striving to secure livelihood. Our ancients realised that there can be another way of securing it. This is through symbolic action, a kind of magic, better understood as worship. The Karma Kanda in the Vedas is essentially a manual of magic to help achieve life’s purposes. Creation itself is magic. In the Book of Genesis, God sees darkness and says, let it be day, and it was day. To say is to do.Worship is a mild simulation of such magic.Worship is not counter to work.Worship is work.To learn this is to learn the art of living. The real challenge, though, lies in understanding worship.Worship can be self-defeating if it is fruit-centric. One can be damned by getting one’s prayers answered. Rabindranath Tagore thanks God for the blessing of frustrating his prayers time and again. True worship lies in joyous surrender to the will of God.



Again, it is important to know as to who is the object of worship. Hinduism is often criticised for entertaining numberless demigods. What is missed is that there exists a great unity among this seeming diversity. All services reach the One God. But the results are according to the intermediate demigod to whom the service was directed. The message is clear:focus on the Ultimate One God, even as you worship and propitiate a demigod. Worship need not always be physical. Ideal worship is mental, whether accompanied by physical acts or not. And, a subtle instruction is that worship is not for one’s own pleasure but for the pleasure of God.And it is an incessant engagement, not a fixed hour ritual.The comfort God promises to such an unwavering devotee — nitya’bhiyukta — is: ‘Securing your mundane well-being is my concern — yoga’kshemam vahamyaham.’

Being Popular In School May Not Lead To Happiness After All!,"You kid in high school might believe popularity is of the utmost importance to them. A new study, however, found that kind of acceptance may not lead to long-term happiness. Close friendships that they maintained over time is what mattered more, according to a study published in the journal Child Development.

BCCL/Representational Image

So, if you're worried about your son or daughter being too friendly with his or her mates, take heart. Having strong and intimate friendships during adolescence may help improve several aspects of mental health such as anxiety, social acceptance, self-worth and symptoms of depression, researchers say.

""Our research found that the quality of friendships during adolescence may directly predict aspects of long-term mental and emotional health,"" said lead author Rachel K. Narr, PhD candidate in clinical psychology at the University of Virginia.

""High school students with higher-quality best friendships tended to improve in several aspects of mental health over time, while teens who were popular among their peers during high school may be more prone to social anxiety later in life,"" Narr added.

BCCL/Representational Image

The study looked at a community sample of 169 adolescents over 10 years, from the time they were age 15 to when they were 25.

The youth were racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse, with 58 per cent Caucasian, 29 per cent African American and eight per cent of mixed race or ethnicity.

BCCL/Representational Image

Adolescents were assessed annually, answering questions about who their closest friends were, reporting on their friendships and participating in interviews and assessments exploring such feelings as anxiety, social acceptance, self-worth and symptoms of depression.

Researchers found that teens who prioritised close friendships at age 15 had lower social anxiety, an increased sense of self-worth and fewer symptoms of depression by the time they reached age 25 than their peers.

facebook/Representational Image

Neither having a strong friendship nor being more popular predicted short-term changes in mental health, the researchers noted.

The researchers suggested that this may be because positive experiences with friends help bolster positive feelings about oneself during a stage of life when personal identity is being developed.

Also, close friendships may set adolescents on a trajectory to expect and therefore encourage supportive experiences in the future."
Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here’s How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let’s learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let’s say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here’s how you can too:

The I-Can’t-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

Click selfies with a lot of people around. They make you feel happier and prettier.

Twitter

Somehow group selfies are awesome, especially when it’s with people who love you to the core. There are a whole bunch of smiles, and when you are all dressed in your best, it’s got to be awesome. Deepika swears by this too, since most of the times she clicks group selfies with her adoring fans.

Portray You as You!

Let your all-purpose phone speak out your personality and define you as a person.

OPPO F3

Afterall, this gadget is literally close to your heart at all times. From the external design to the internal configuration, it’s got to describe you in a second to an unknown person passing by. Whether you are an hard-core techie or a fashionista like Deepika, your phone should be able to portray you in the right light.

Customize it to speak out your mind.

OPPO F3

Since outward appearances speak out louder, customize the exterior according to what’s on your mind. Bedazzle it, hard-case it or if you don’t vouch for it, you can customize the interior too! Deepika has customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as #F3DeepikaEdition.

7 Fruits That Can Boost Your Iron Levels Similar To How Vegetables And Supplements Do,"The benefits of increasing the intake of iron in your diet are no longer a mystery. From keeping your energy levels high to preventing hair loss or even tackling conditions such as anaemia; we cannot function without adequate levels of iron in our body.

chesterbennington.tk

We've been harping over vegetables like spinach and supplements that boost your intake of iron for decades now. But did you know that not only are some fruits loaded with iron they also help your body absorb it better from other sources. If you’re a lover of fruits though, these are some potent options you can try out:

Raisins

picturebritain.com

This easily accessible fruit is one of the most potent fruit sources of iron, with around 1.6 milligrams of iron in it. Raisins can be mixed with almonds, cashews and pistachios or mixed with sweet dishes.

Figs

fitbody.ro

The beauty about figs is that they can be eaten fresh or dried. Their iron content is amplified when they are soaked overnight.

Dates

media24.az

Not only are these fruits super-sweet a cup (250gm) of dates contain up to 3 milligrams of iron. Add it to salads or sweet dishes like ice creams.

Pomegranates

greek-gourmet.gr

You can literally never get bored of having pomegranates in any form you like every day. Whether it be in a salad or as fresh juice they are loaded with iron and can help you fight blood-related such as anaemia or iron deficiency.

Citrus fruits

slurrpy.com

Although the citrus fruits are an excellent source of vitamin C, the citrus in the fruit is ideal for absorbing the iron in the greens and the nuts.

Tropical fruits

healthexcellence.net

Fruits like guava, papaya, kiwi’s and mango contain copious amounts of vitamin C as well; thereby helping with the absorption of iron.

Berries

wallpapershome.ru

Berries such as raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and especially strawberries are also great sources of vitamin C, which can further help with the absorption of iron."
"Morocco’s Africa Vision: Shun politics, shared development is key to continental prosperity","The recent speech of Morocco’s King Mohammed VI on the occasion of the 64th anniversary of the Revolution of the King and People – an important event in Moroccan history – laid out a grand vision for Africa. It will be recalled that Morocco returned to the African Union (AU) earlier this year after more than three decades of self-imposed exclusion. But the Kingdom’s return to the African institutional family is not going to be an end in itself. This is something that King Mohammed made amply clear in his speech that dwelled on the need to unite Africa for shared security and prosperity.

King Mohammed said, “Now is the time for action. And Morocco keenly looks forward to continuing the efforts it has been exerting in Africa for more than fifteen years”, adding further, “Reintegration into the AU is but the start of a new era of joint action with all African countries in order to build a genuine, solidarity-based partnership, ensure – together – our continent’s development and meet the needs of African citizens. We are currently in the process of building an Africa that believes in itself, is committed to solidarity and rallies behind concrete projects while being open to its surroundings”. In fact, Morocco has been championing South-South cooperation for some time now. The idea here is to build mutually beneficial partnerships and find African solutions for African problems.

The implied meaning of King Mohammed’s speech is that Morocco’s return to the AU will galvanise the institution as the Kingdom will leave no stone unturned to facilitate common development, transfer of knowledge and boost intra-regional investments. Morocco has already demonstrated its resolve in this direction by conceptualising and actualising significant development projects like the proposed Morocco-Nigeria Trans-African gas pipeline, the construction of fertiliser plants in Ethiopia and Nigeria, and the myriad human development initiatives in the countries of the Sahel.

Why is this important? Africa is the place from where the next global growth push will come. The continent’s rising middle class combined with improving governance structures lays the foundation for solid consumption/investment-driven development. However, there are challenges that Africa must overcome first. These range from security threats and political instability to basics such as insufficient food production and clean drinking water. But today the technology is available for Africa to leapfrog some of the stages of development and catapult itself into a veritable growth hub. It is here that Morocco’s technical knowhow and experience come in handy.

What Morocco is seeking to do is plug the gaps in Africa’s development. It’s doing this through boosting fertiliser production in sister African nations, strengthening healthcare facilities in partner countries, and financing entrepreneurship in brotherly states. Further, it has been providing huge scholarships to African students as an investment on the youth of the continent. All of these measures go to show that Morocco is serious about shared African prosperity and will continue to power African growth from within the AU.

African nations ought to realise that they can’t succeed as individuals. The only way they can move forward is through genuine win-win partnerships. Hence, they would do well to heed Morocco’s vision for Africa, set aside differences and artificial disputes, and fulfil their destiny as a continent of prosperity."

The Best Way Out,"Until you acknowledge and find the courage to deal with what you are trying to escape, the problems will continue, creating ‘looping patterns’ in your life, says MARGUERITE THEOPHIL



Sometimes, it feels easier to avoid a problem or challenge — or even an opportunity that has no guaranteed positive outcome. You distract yourself, make excuses, procrastinate; do anything but enter the situation. There are times when this is simply self-preservation; nothing too wrong there — but often it keeps you from entering a space that will help you learn and grow or keeps you stuck in a place that diminishes you. Sometimes,though,you are thrown into just such a situation, ready or not. You struggle, going through most stages of what is called the ‘grief cycle’, an extended form of this being the stages of shock, denial, anger, bargaining, depression — but you stop short of the last two: testing (of realistic options and solutions) and acceptance. This is because often acceptance does not mean the end of things; it is the beginning of moving into spaces, into decisions, into unfamiliar ways of being you would rather not move into. Such an attitude and the corresponding behaviours are often referred to as escapism. Escapism is when you try to avoid something. Some escape by excessive sleeping, shopping, eating, playing or inordinate time spent online. Some drown themselves in work; or alcohol or drugs. We all know people who stay in jobs or abusive marriages only because they are afraid of failure in pursuing what they love, or because they are not sure if there is another better someone elsewhere.People who avoid challenges because they are afraid of possible pain and suffering; who avoid healing their past because they are reminded of their deepest sorrows;who avoid confronting issues because they think they have no strength to face them.



‘Better the devil we know…’ they say sadly. Rather than ease your pain and suffering, this attitude prolongs and sometimes deepens them. At times people think the solution is to bury them or numb themselves to their effects — but the issue and its effects just stay dormant, silently growing until the day it will all resurface. Until you acknowledge and find the courage to deal with what you are trying to escape from, your issues will not miraculously disappear.They continue, creating ‘looping patterns’ in your life — getting stuck again and again in similar situations and contexts, thinking the same things,feeling the same emotions,doing the same things, linking up with similar people. Looping patterns require conscious intervention in order to break out of them.And the best and most wise advice for these times — though not that easy to follow — is:‘The best way out is through.’ An old teaching story comes to mind: Once upon a time, there was a tortoise on a ship, and the ship sank in the middle of the ocean.The tortoise made it to a bit of land surrounded by water on all sides except for one. The strip of barren land led up to a high, steep, craggy mountain. To avoid starving to death, the tortoise decided to climb to the top,hoping that he would be able to cross, and find something to eat on the other side. You would know this would take a long, long time; not only was the terrain daunting — this is a tortoise we are talking about! When he finally got to the snow-covered summit he was freezing cold, and then a blizzard started.



He just managed to make out a narrow pathway leading down the other side of the mountain and made his way towards it. But ahead on the path was a big monster that wouldn’t stop shouting, ‘Vuuh uuh uuuuh!’ This sound and his fear almost killed the tortoise; all he wanted to do was hide his head inside his shell. But, looking around him, he noticed many other animals of all sizes lying there, frozen to death. He summoned up all his courage to move down the path towards the monster.The closer the tortoise got, the more the monster changed its shape. Then, when he was almost upon it, the tortoise realised that what he had thought was a monster, was only a great pile of rocks, what he thought were dead frozen animals were other smaller rocks. As for the ‘Vuuh uuh uuuuh!’ — the tortoise realised this was just the sound of the wind blowing through a small cave. He made his slow but determined way to the greenery that he could see ahead. Remember, in the process of working through your issues, you don’t always win quickly. Sometimes you may make some progress, only to slide back later.



Sometimes, you get beaten back down almost immediately, particularly if it involves dealing with something you have been struggling with for a long time. Don’t be afraid of asking for help or guidance; admitting you need help does not make you weak, it makes you strong.You might need help and support of others, professionals or loved ones, to ‘hang in there’, but ultimately, it is your journey. Yet being convinced that the best way out is through, you find out that as long as you keep going, as long as you keep confronting your issues, as long as you keep fighting, as long as you confront your fears, as long as you know that the way out lies through and beyond all this — you become stronger and stronger, and find a way to conquer the mess.

Public investment trade-offs: The long and short of it,"Public investment becomes the default option when the economic commentariat suggests a solution to combat a phase charaterized by a slowdown in investment. India is no exception to this phenomenon and there are periodic calls to enhance public investment to deal with India’s current spell of weak private investment.

Public investment, however, involves a tough trade-off. Should more money be spent on expanding a country’s stock of physical infrastructure such as roads, or should the quality of human capital be enhanced through larger outlays in education?

Four economists, Manoj Atolia, Bin Grace Li, Ricardo Marto and Giovanni Melina, recently examined this question. Their research address a couple of important questions.

# Why is public spending on social infrastructure not higher in developing countries?

# What determines the composition of public infrastructure investment?

Their conclusions are that increasing spending on physical infrastructure has a quicker impact on economic performance; enhancing the quality of social infrastructure through spending on education improves workers’ productivity in the long-run; and social infrastructure investment needs larger current spending on maintenance.

In short, the trade-off which faces policy makers is to choose between putting money where the immediate returns are higher or one where the long-run benefits are more meaningful.

For a politician who has to face voters at relatively short intervals, there is strong incentive to choose an option which promises immediate returns.

In India, the organization of governmental responsibilities means that chief ministers often have a tougher job in this matter. State governments have a larger say in investing in both education and roads.

Even if a chief minister is inclined to allocate more resources on education, the need to get re-elected is likely to get in the way. This is because popular discourse judges chief ministers through a “development” prism. Enhancing social infrastructure is also a part of development, but one where the benefits show up after a generation.

Therefore, in the emphasis to show results in a short time-frame, governments will almost always push resources into building physical infrastructure at the cost of social infrastructure."
Infosys’s driverless golf cart versus Google’s autonomous vehicles: How can India become a global technology innovation hotspot?,"On July 14, 2017, Infosys unveiled its driverless golf cart designed and built by its engineering service team at its Mysuru campus. In contrast, by June 2016, eight years since its inception, Google’s fleet of autonomous vehicles had been driven for 28 lakh kilometers. In 2015, Google completed its first driverless ride on public roads, giving ride to a sole blind man in Austin, Texas (Wikipedia). Take another case. In April 2016, Infosys unveiled its Artificial Intelligence platform MANA. However, the first major demonstration of a similar SAP product HANA was in 2008. Can Infosys ever match up to Google’s autonomous vehicles given that it started 8 years too late? Or, can it ever beat SAP in launching a new product? In fact, breakthrough technology innovation is consistently taking place, for example, hyperloop transport, 100 MW lithium ion battery for solar PV storage, magnetically levitated trains running at over 600 km/h, wireless car battery charging, hot solar cells, practical quantum computers, paralysis reversal implants; the list goes on and on. India is far removed from the global technology innovation ecosphere. Even China is far ahead of India in technology development in manifold spheres such as advanced biometric techniques, high speed trains, military hardware, and even the traditional steel and aluminium plants. If Infosys, a progressive, cash-rich company, with enormous global exposure cannot anticipate technology direction and plays the catch-up game in product development, it is time for serious introspection about the vision and methodology of our research and development (R&D). Thus, the big question: How do we make India a global technology innovation hotspot?

Lack of technology vision has been a major impediment in Indian product development. Take the case of information technology (IT). By the late 1990s, it was abundantly clear that IT-integrated hardware would be an essential part of our life, be it communication devices, transportation, consumer appliances, shopping, and entertainment. Thus, transition from manual to automatic transmission to cruise control to driver-less vehicles (DLVs) was a natural progression. Cloud computing was expected to be a natural corollary of the internet era but you will not find Infosys/TCS/Wipro ranked among the ten best global companies. Artificial intelligence is expected to run devices and businesses more efficiently, but here too we arrived late to the party. Similarly, clean technologies and renewable energy should have been a priority area for the manufacturing industry much earlier.

We need industry leaders with the courage to take a leap of faith like Elon Musk who came up with the audaciously ambitious concept of hyperloop transport, which successfully completed its first full-scale test in May. India could have had its Elon Musk moment with driverless cars? The sensors used in navigating a DLV through traffic such as LiDAR, camera, radar, actuators were available before 2008. We had the expertise to integrate the data from sensors into a software, which would then control the motion of the DLV based on the traffic around it. Clearly a company such as TCS/Infosys could have developed a proof of concept DLV before Google. So what if the DLV was expensive and looked clunky, at least TCS/Infosys would have enough lead time to refine the DLV technology and challenge the hegemony of Google. Similarly, Mukesh Ambani has the resources to conceive and implement out-of-the-world ideas such as the space tourism capsule by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos or develop innovative solar energy and carbon capture and sequestration technologies like ExxonMobil. Unfortunately, Reliance Industries Ltd has no major technology innovation on offer, Reliance Jio being only a business model disruptor.

Emphasis on value added products and reverse engineering are two ways of countering entrenched global companies. Low costs are simply not enough as the generics-centered Indian pharmaceutical is finding out. An example in the change in mind-set is from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, which “rather than simply copy Glaxo’s migraine medication Imitrex, tweaked the formula to make it act faster at smaller doses (www.livemint.com).” The Indian steel industry is also shifting its focus towards special steels for high speed trains, nuclear and automobile industries. In many such cases, strategic foreign collaboration is required. And, this is where reverse engineering comes in. Learning the intricacies of the production process of and then leveraging this knowledge for developing innovative new products is the way forward, as China has done so successfully over the years.

Successful commercialization of new products requires an integrated approach. That is, a new product must be backed by appropriate infrastructural — software and hardware — support. Despite the concern for environment, electric cars will never be a success unless it is backed by facilities for superfast battery charging or charging on the go, as in wireless charging.

Finally, there must be a fundamental shift in our approach towards research and product development. Is it worth expending significant R&D in non-strategic products where the chances of being a global leader are remote? Take the example of automobile engines. Taxi owners will tell you that a Toyota Etios can run for more than 300,000 km without any major tinkering with the engine. The corresponding number for a Tata Indigo is about 100,000 km. Consequently, why should we even bother about significant R&D in automobile engines especially when such technologies can be readily bought off-the-shelf. Instead, we should follow a composite approach for R&D: (i) value-addition in existing products/technologies to increase energy efficiency and lower costs and (ii) focus firmly on technologies of tomorrow such as batteries, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and 3-D printing."
15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."

Cheteshwar Pujara's Nottinghamshire return confirmed

English county side Nottinghamshire has confirmed on Wednesday (August 23) that Cheteshwar Pujara will feature in the last four league-stage fixtures as the team seeks to gain promotion from Division Two.

The right-handed batsman was part of Nottinghamshire's ascendancy to the top of Division Two earlier this year, scoring his runs at 44.6 in the four matches he played. Nottinghamshire were relegated from Division One after finishing rock bottom in the 2016 season.

The side's head coach, Peter Moores, welcomed Pujara's return, recognizing the boost his team will receive. ""He is a fantastic player, and since he has been away he has had a great time of it in the Test matches for India,"" Moores said.

""So we are getting a guy who is coming back in form and for the team spirit, Pudji (Pujara) coming back in is a huge boost for everybody.

Pujara has been in top form recently, scoring two centuries in India's 3-0 series win over Sri Lanka in the three-Test series.

""Runs on the board at Trent Bridge is always a big influence and having a player of Test-match quality in Pudji is a real bonus. The great thing is that he has already been in the squad this season and he fitted in so well both on and off the field.""

In all likelihood, this sets up a showdown between two Indian players when Nottinghamshire host Worcestershire on September 5. Off-spinner, Ravichandran Ashwin, had only recently announced his signing with Worcestershire.

Nottinghamshire are currently top of the table in Division Two, and have four games left.

DU's Zero Cut-Off For Ph.D. Admissions For SC/ST Students Is Driving Everyone Up The Wall!,"So, for Ph.D. Mathematics, the qualifying marks is a big, round zero?!

Delhi University's recent cut-off list for SC/ST students for admissions in Ph.D. Mathematics lists zero as the ""minimum marks scored"". Well, it can get any minimum than this!

nyoooz

People are outraged. Rightly so. If this is what the fight, to have the reservation in India, has come to then anyone falling in the General category can simply take a hike.

How did the Department of Mathematics at DU even come up with this cut-off? Why does the OBC have to score an 84? Oh, let's not even heed the sound of the Unreserved's breaking hearts who have to score a 94 to qualify.

This is the interview schedule that is making everyone's blood boil.

Limited-overs series chance for team, including MS, to create good habits: Kohli

• Last updated on Wed, 23 Aug, 2017, 08:51 PM Gokul Gopal in Pallekele

In the past few years, Dhoni the batsman, has been playing a sedate role in the middle order and had had problems finishing games on occasions. © AFP

Ever since he retired from Test cricket in December 2014, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's India duties have come in patches with several breaks in between his limited-overs assignments. The first three months of 2016 saw a busy schedule for the former India skipper, who played as many as 21 matches. But that period apart, Dhoni hasn't played a string of games to keep himself at pace with India's limited-overs requirements.

Despite being 36, Dhoni's fitness levels have been well maintained and he continues to remain one of the fittest and quickest Indian cricketers in the current era. But his performances with the bat have dipped, especially when it comes to finishing matches; not getting a chunk of cricket under his belt could be one of the reasons. ""We all want the Indian team to do well. If he is delivering, why not? If he is not, we will have to look at alternatives,"" chief selector MSK Prasad had recently said when asked if Dhoni remains an automatic choice in the ODI format.

In the past few years, Dhoni the batsman, has been playing a sedate role in the middle order and had had problems finishing games on occasions. He has also been shuffled around in the batting order, five times at number four, once at number six while he has batted at number five for most of the games this year. With the Indian selectors confirming KL Rahul as the number 4 batsman and the likes of Kedar Jadhav and Hardik Pandya coming lower down, Dhoni at five seems to be the best option for India currently. However, that will also leave him manning the finishing role, which will come as an added pressure.

As a finisher, Dhoni's contributions have been off-colour in the last few months. A 65-ball 39 against New Zealand in October 2016, a 36-ball 25 against England at the start of this year and a 114-ball 54 against Windies before this series are some of the instances where Dhoni didn't see his team over the line despite being in the best position to do so.

The current streak of India's limited-overs assignments count to 20 matches - five ODIs and one T20I against Sri Lanka, five ODIs and three T20Is against Australia and three ODIs and as many T20Is against New Zealand. It remains to be seen if Dhoni features in all these games, considering Rishabh Pant is also on the selectors' radar, especially in T20Is. But in the two T20Is that Pant has played so far, Dhoni has remained India's middle-order option and also the first-choice wicketkeeper.

""It's a great opportunity for us as a team to play limited-overs cricket for a while,"" skipper Virat Kohli said on Wednesday (August 23) with regards to the host of limited-overs assignments lined up for the Indian team. ""Last year and a half we haven't played as much limited-overs cricket and maybe that's the reason we haven't been as consistent in the shorter formats. But this gives us an opportunity to create momentum like we have done in Test cricket.

""We have made few changes already with where the teams want to go as far as our fitness goals are concerned. And we want to have possibly the best fielding side on the park, one that is dynamic that will remain consistent. And this coming season gives us an opportunity to define roles for players and give them time to execute it so that for the World Cup we know exactly what one player needs to do in certain situations. And it is not going to be anything that we have done in the past repetitively, it is not going to be predictable anymore,"" Kohli added.

For someone like Dhoni, who has been used to multiple breaks since his Test retirement, the string of matches will help him get on the same page as far as the team's goals are concerned, and also get a fair share of international matches which will help him build some momentum as a contributor in the team, something that Kohli acknowledged in agreement.

""It helps someone like Dhoni because he doesn't play Test cricket anymore and this long streak of matches will help him to be in touch with the international games and finding some momentum and sticking to it. It goes for every player in the team. You want to find momentum in a season like this and make sure you carry it through with consistent performances every now and then. So it's an opportunity for everyone in the team including MS to create good habits and sustain them over a period of time,"" he said.

As a accumulator who likes to take the game close, Dhoni's modus operandi has been to minimise risks at the start of his innings and attempt a few big hits only later in his innings. While this has, on occasions, helped him make up for his strike-rate, it still leaves him with the risk of having a lot to do towards the end. Dhoni, of late, has also struggled a bit to rotate the strike, consuming a lot of dot deliveries in the process. This has invariably left him with a lot of catching up to do and has allowed the opposition to keep him quiet with set fields, all combined it has contributed to some of his recent failures.

However, watching Dhoni bat in the nets - striking the ball cleanly, a compact technique and handling the bowlers with ease - there is a sense of assurance and also hope that Dhoni of the old could make a reappearance. He appears to have made some changes to his batting, eliminating some of the fidgety, trigger movements that he used to have earlier. Whether this helps him will only be known when he comes out to bat the next time. But there is some urgency about him, which India will be hoping that it serves the team well in their preparations for the next big event.

Maxwell underlines 'defence' as key to success in Bangladesh Tests

Atif Azam • Last updated on Wed, 23 Aug, 2017, 06:01 PM

Glenn Maxwell stressed upon the need to strengthen their defence ahead of the two-match Test series in Bangladesh. © Cricbuzz

Australia batsman Glenn Maxwell, on August 23 (Wednesday), stressed upon the need to strengthen their defence ahead of the two-match Test series in Bangladesh, starting on August 27.

The middle-order batsman, who sustained a heatstroke on the opening day of the makeshift training session after the Fatullah practice game was called off, is eager to work on the compactness of his technique in order to extend his innings in the series.

""I caught a bit of heatstroke on the first day which wasn't a good start,"" Maxwell told the reporters after the training session. ""I think just doing some running outside, then had to go inside to do some fitness tests and then going back outside didn't help too much. The body shut down a little bit but I was fine after the ice bath and plenty of fluids.""

The 28-year-old spoke extensively about the defensive technique being one of the major requisites needed to succeed in the country. ""A lot of my practice revolves around defense and expanding from there. I haven't done so much of it since I have been here but I am sure I will get a chance before the game starts,"" Maxwell said.

""It is more about guys who are hitting the stumps regularly and Bangladesh do that really well. They bowl stump to stump and put pressure on your defence so I suppose that's one thing we will work on,"" he added.

Maxwell reiterated that their batsmen need be confident of their own ability, especially when it comes to using their pad as the second line of defense. However, his emphasis remained more on using the bat than anything else.

""I think the main thing is to basically use your bat. If you don't have the safety of your front pad, it makes you get your leg out of the way and actually use your bat. I think it is more about refining your defence and making sure you trust the fact that you can hit the ball and not hoping that your pads are there just to save you,"" Maxwell noted.

Maxwell, however, was quick to dismiss any pressure regarding the kind of surface that would be put out by the hosts. The big-hitting batsman mentioned that they had trained in extremely difficult conditions at Darwin in the build-up to this tour, and had covered all bases to be prepared for the subcontinent wickets.

""The wickets here are similar to what we faced in Darwin where it was perfect. We put extreme conditions in Darwin with the wickets where we made it ridiculously tough to bat on and guys tested themselves really well during that week. I think the guys are more than well equipped to handle whatever comes their way in the first Test,"" he said.

Maxwell also admitted that it won't be cakewalk against Bangladesh, especially with bowlers like Mustafizur Rahman and Shakib Al Hasan, who are capable of posing a threat to any side in the world.

""Mustafizur is obviously an exceptional bowler we faced during the IPL.. during his breakthrough season. I suppose his pace [has] dropped off as he played a bit more Test cricket.

""He is still an outstanding bowler who has the ability to swing it and has an unbelievable change-up slower ball. He is not your conventional left-arm seamer. He is obviously got a very flexible wrist with which he can flick it in the last moment. It looks exactly the same either it is his bumper or his slower ball. It is a hard thing to pick up,"" said Maxwell while conceding that even Shakib would be a major thorn in the eye.

""He is a really experienced player. He has been the No. 1 all-rounder in the world for a while. He is an excellent cricketer. We have to play these guys really well to negate their influence in the Test series and make sure we are staying on top of the game.""

Maxwell, who scored his maiden Test ton against India in Ranchi, exuded confidence about the plans he had employed for the India tour earlier in the year. ""I don't think I will change too much from what I did in India. I thought I had really good plans during the Test series against them. I will employ probably something similar, basically backing my defense and trying to revolve my game around that.

""It is basically going to be batting long periods of time and making sure that when we do bat those long periods of time we are making big hundreds.""

Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‘nationalist’ mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India’s ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism’s about freedom for the mind and democracy’s about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It’s time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar’s vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP’s madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don’t these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‘golf-playing Macaulayputra’, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities – of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation – feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn’t call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that’s why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler’s supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent’s ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That’s because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other’s shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It’s really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That’s why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament – the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet – the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism’s unobtrusive ‘soft power’, one that’s created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It’s time to change the goal of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to the more inclusive ‘Indian Rashtra.’ The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."
House guests and fish: Both of them begin to stink up the home after about three days 😜,"It is truly said that house guests and fish have a common factor. After three days they begin to stink. You arrive at the host’s place full of warmth and sunshine and thoughtful gifts and they give you the hastily refurbished room with spanking new sheets, a fresh bar of soap, a fluffy towel smelling of naphthalene (saved in the suitcase for a special occasion) and a tube of toothpaste.

Come next morning and they have told you, relax, no rush to wake up, get over your jet lag, so you are lying there not making a noise in case they wake up and they are in the adjoining room lying there not making a noise in case you are disturbed and this absurd scenario in mutual accommodation can go half way onto lunch and then finally both have the same thought, they have to go and so the encounter occurs outside the bathroom door and now there is a flurry of no, no, you go first, no, you please, no hurry, all yours, it’s okay.

And then it is lunch and they have laid on a veritable feast and you haven’t the heart to tell them that you are on a sparse diet (so much for what the health) and this is going to wreck it and why have they bothered and the host is thinking, we never make this much on any other day, costs a fortune and they have pulled out the finest linen and crockery and that silver cutlery set that is used only to impress guests.

Then they have mapped out the tour for you to sightsee and you are not a sightseer and you have to pretend this is the most exciting idea and what you don’t know is that the host would rather watch Chelsea play Arsenal and instead he has to go with you because his wife hissed and said, it doesn’t look nice if you stay back, it’s only a soccer game.

Finally, it is day three and you have both run out of conversation and you are avoiding their obnoxious teenage children who resent you for having ‘stolen’ their room so they are having to share and the husband and wife are now asking oblique questions to ascertain when you are leaving like should we book theatre tickets for Sunday and your wife sends you a WhatsApp saying take them out for dinner and now you are in this fancy restaurant calculating the bill and it is a sobering thought that it is big enough for you to have stayed in a hotel and watched India play Sri Lanka."
26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you’ve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with “addiction of online binge watching”.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

giphy

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."

Realist strategy: Trump’s new Afghanistan plan puts much-needed squeeze on Pakistan,"In a marked departure from his campaign rhetoric, US President Donald Trump has outlined his new Afghanistan strategy that favours realism over politics. Reversing the previous Obama administration’s approach that was focussed on drawing down American troops, the new plan authorises the deployment of an additional 4,000 soldiers to train and buttress Afghan forces. Trump is right in assessing that a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan would create a vacuum for terrorists, including the Afghan branch of Islamic State (IS), to fill. This is precisely what happened with Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq that led to the rise of IS.

Obama’s Afpak policy didn’t work for a number of reasons. Announcing deadlines for a drawdown made it easy for the Taliban to wait out the Americans. Secondly, it is next to impossible to defeat an insurgency which has safe havens, and Pakistan provided those havens. The new Trump policy seeks to address both. It will not focus on deadlines but on actual ground conditions. Thirdly, Trump put Pakistan on notice for providing safe havens to terror groups. Part of the problem of the US policy in Afghanistan has been Washington’s over-reliance on Islamabad. This has allowed the Pakistanis to shelter terror groups.

Trump has said this situation needs to change. It is in Pakistan’s best interest that it stops providing safe havens and succour to terrorists. If it refuses to do so, the Trump strategy promises that the full panoply of available diplomatic, economic and military instruments will be used in concert to achieve this outcome. Sustained pressure along these lines is bound to yield results. It’s good that Trump has acknowledged India’s role in Afghan stability and development. To buttress the new strategy Trump should also not rock the boat with Iran, which too has a stake in Afghan stability."
Legendary Carl Lewis Is Unhappy With The Singular Focus On Jamaican Showman Usain Bolt,"The last decade in world athletics belonged to Usain Bolt but the legendary Carl Lewis is not happy with the singular focus on the Jamaican showman.

Considered the greatest athlete of all time, Jamaican Bolt drew curtains on his illustrious career after a disappointing performance at the World Championship in London, where he could only win a bronze in the 100m.

AFP

""The sport is not just about one person. Nobody is irreplaceable. Track and field survived many civilizations. Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson and now Usain Bolt. Men will all come and go but the sport will always remain,"" Lewis, who has won nine Olympic gold medals, told PTI in an exclusive interview.

With Bolt's retirement, Lewis feels that it's time to build on the sport now that people will get over their obsession with a singular man.

""We need to do more to build on the sport. We don't need to follow that trend that we have been in the last eight years, which was just about following one person (Bolt),"" Lewis didn't mince words as he spoke on the sidelines of the 29th Summer Universiade here.

""Our job is to fill the void. In the last 10 years, the sport has not grown as the focus was just on one man. The point is we need to build competition. We now have a unique chance to rebuild and grow our sport. Now we have a chance to make a difference, grow our sport and not just grow yourself,"" Lewis' sarcasm on Bolt's cult status was pretty much evident.

AFP

Lewis, who won Long Jump gold in four successive Olympic Games (1984, 88, 92 and 96), is not at all amused that 'Brand Bolt' became bigger than the sport.

""We were just so caught up trying to make one person all about the whole sport and now we have a unique opportunity to spread it across the board and really allow it grow,"" said Lewis.

Lewis termed World Championship 100m silver medallist Christian Coleman and Rio bronze medallist Canadian Andre de Grasse are the ones to watch out for in the coming years.

""Christian Coleman was second (in World Championships) behind Justin Gatlin and he had the fastest time this year. Gatlin is 35 years old and that was probably his last Major championship. I think De Grasse and Coleman are both great athletes and I am really excited about them,"" Lewis is confident that they can maintain the standard set by Bolt.

Lewis, is in Taiwan as the assistant coach of the US track and field University team and named young Cameron Burrell as the next big thing among American track and field.

Young Cameron competes both in 100m and long jump like Lewis and is the son of Lewis' former teammate Leroy Burrell (a 1991 World Championship 100m bronze medallist) and Olympic relay champion.

Lewis and Burrell Sr also competed together for the famous Santa Monica Track Club.

AFP

""I was a long jumper who ran sprints. And now Cameron is trying to do that. I would love to see that. He is a great kid and he has the potential to become an Olympic champion,"" Lewis opined.

With Cameron's reference, Lewis took another dig at Bolt. ""That's the great thing about our sport and I think Cameron is going to be an Olympics champion one day and Coleman is also going to be an Olympic champion.

""Everyone just wants to talk about the garden centre instead of lumber area or the clothing area. We have a great sport that we need to spread it across and talk about the unique relationships. Don't let people get into the box where it is about just one person.""

Lewis however did not like termed the booing of Gatlin after winning the 100m dash at the recent World Championships ahead of Bolt as ""childish"".

""It was unfair. I am not saying what he has done is right. But it was childish,"" he said."

Infosys crisis: Are we soft on never-go-letters?,"Everybody and their auntie are having a go with their sharp stick at the Right Honourable N R Narayana Murthy. The man’s a kook, they say, putting a Chosen One on the Iron Throne and then treating him like a bekaar damaad. That NRN, once having decided (twice, actually) to walk into the sunset, is once again caught acting like a ‘benevolent well-wisher’ from some Spartan I’m-not-Vijay Mallya getaway and pulling the strings till the puppet decides to walk away.

That Master Yoda is the one who needs to walk away — and stay walked away — has been the general consensus from the chorus line. I mean, who likes the younger generation to be brought in with moderate fanfare, and then have the same younger generation (slightly older by then) shunted, for, well, being young and stupid? Answer: India 2017.

Being stupid is what NRN has really been accusing Vishal Sikka, handpicked as MD-CEO in the summer of 2014, of. According to Murthy and his fellow Infytainers, Sikka is responsible for Infosys becoming a spluttering train. If Clark ‘Nagavara Ramarao’ Kent had not coaxed himself into bringing Murthyman out of retirement, the spluttering train was sure to become a train wreck, goes one theory.

But my heart, despite all the flak he’s facing, goes out to NRN. It’s not because I don’t agree with his critics. Yes, Sikka’s Infosys ship isn’t the same Infosys raft that the Seven Samurai led by Murthy-san launched from the harbour in 1981. For starters, the software field had only a handful of players to contend with. Plus, the post-BPO world of technology has changed faster than Infy may have had.

Also, Infosys was really a startup before any startup invented the word ‘startup’. So, making the rules then was more fun than keeping the rules now. And despite the mantra about ‘Learning how to fail, learning from the failures’ blahblahblah, Indians, especially India Inc, still don’t like rules being (seen to be) broken, and are loath to allow things to fail. Intervention is a constant nanny in the form of concerned ‘elders’ in the background, or pusillanimous gatekeepers in the front.

But let’s face it. Is Murthyman the only one who likes holding on to the reins even when he has passed them on? More importantly, is our culture not a wee bit bonkers when it comes to allowing‘elders’ to linger, and then meddle so that they can have their cake, eat it, and then complain about the icing too?

Amitabh Bachchan, thankfully, picks and chooses his roles better these days. But I remember a whole decade when toupée not in hand, he was offered roles — which he accepted — that fit him as snugly as a glove fits a goat. Even as an admirer of Sachin Tendulkar’s cover drive, the less said about how he reached his 100th international century, courtesy the BCSCI (Board of Control for Sachin’s Cricket to Inspire), the better.

In politics, of course, we find the original trendsetters. Any politician saying that he or she will now make way for ‘new blood’ either has no clue about transfusion, or is making a strategic move. Let’s just say that in the Congress, this rule applies if your surname happens to be the same as Sonia Gandhi’s. A free hand given to aScindia or a Pilot or even a Singh is as plausible as the queen of England making way for her eldest son while she (and he) is still alive.

In the BJP government, the ‘holding on to the reins’ quality is marked by the quantum of policymaking-andbreaking powers ministers have in aShah-sprayed Modi government.

That could, perhaps, maybe, possibly explain the current disinterest in the impending Cabinet reshuffle. In regional parties, too, sharing responsibilities, or passing the pillow, down the ranks of Didis and the ghosts of Ammas is not just frowned upon, but proactively resisted as the recipe for ‘chaos’.

We like our busybody taus the same way we extol our workaholics. So, if Murthyman is singled out as a demagogic Nerd-Uncle, it’s a bit rich.

In the world of films, the Lifetime Achievement Award is given to someone who has crossed his creative pinnacle and reached his creative tether. To drive the message home, this award simultaneously recognises his greatness as well as implores him to take a back seat, preferably of a bus and not a car.

In politics, with governorships and presidencies becoming increasingly political, something new is needed for the over(long)-ambitious. In business, the most anarchic of ‘industries’, we are yet to change how we treat our founders and family minders.

So, till then, before you can say hello to Cyrus the Great and Tata to Xerxes, be prepared for more NRNs not leaving the stage, whether sulking, kicking or squealing."
BCB mull postponing West Indies tour,"CHANGE IN PLAN

BCB mull postponing West Indies tour

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Cricket Operations Chairman Akram Khan, said on Wednesday (August 23), that they are mulling to postpone their tour of West Indies to July instead of February 2018, which was a part of their original itinerary, keeping in tune with the possibility of the hosts taking part in the World Cup qualifiers.

Khan also mentioned that they started to look for a feasible slot for the tour only after they learnt of the International Cricket Council (ICC) calendar which stated the qualifiers were slated for the month of March.

West Indies, currently ranked ninth in the ICC standings, look all set to feature in the competition. ""There is a huge possibility of this change in schedule for our next tour of West Indies,"" Khan told Cricbuzz on Wednesday.

""We had to look for other available options after we understood that West Indies will need to play the ICC World Cup qualifiers,"" Khan said. ""Both of us agreed to make this change if that is required under the present circumstances.""

Cricbuzz understands that West Indies will host Sri Lanka in June after the qualifiers, before hosting Bangladesh in July. Khan added that if the change happens, it would probably come as a blessing in disguise for them as they would then get some time to recover before leaving for the Caribbean in July.

""If our West Indies tour gets rescheduled, then it comes as a big relief for us,"" mentioned Khan. ""We were supposed to arrange [for] the boarding at the earliest to reach Sri Lanka after the tour in West Indies,"" he further added.

According to the original itinerary, Bangladesh would have had to fly directly to Sri Lanka to play the Nidahas Trophy, scheduled from March 15 to 31, just after finishing their assignment in the West Indies. As per the proposed schedule now, which is expected to be announced officially in a short while, Bangladesh are free from any international commitments from April-July in 2018, before heading off to Australia in August.

Bangladesh have a tight schedule for the remaining part of 2017 during which they will fly to South Africa to play two Tests, three ODIs and three T20Is within a month's span, after the two home Tests against Australia that concludes on September 8.

The Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) will start on November 2, after the players return from their South Africa tour on October 29. The final of BPL is scheduled in the second week of December, before Bangladesh ready themselves to host Sri Lanka for a full tour in December-January.

‘SC’s decision will liberate Muslim women … if Parliament wants to reform personal laws it has full rights to do so’,"Arif Mohammad Khan famously quit in protest as minister of state in the Rajiv Gandhi government after the enactment of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act in 1986, which overturned the Supreme Court’s historic Shah Bano judgment giving maintenance to a divorced Muslim woman. He made an impassioned parliamentary defence of the Shah Bano judgment, the last such landmark case on Muslim women preceding the Supreme Court’s latest 3:2 judgment which has ruled instant triple talaq as unconstitutional, before resigning. Khan spoke to Rohit E David and Nalin Mehta on how ‘talaq-e-biddat’ violates the fundamental rights of Muslim women, gender equality and reforms in Muslim personal laws:

How do you read the Supreme Court’s judgment on triple talaq?

The abolition of triple talaq by the Supreme Court is a big victory. I welcome this verdict. I honestly feel that we are not in a position today to make a realistic assessment of the positive fallout this judgment would have on the future of Muslims.

If a divorce between a Muslim man and woman has to happen, it will take place. The real problem was that a Muslim girl grows with this consciousness that after marriage her husband can turn her out of the house by simply saying triple talaq. This was really oppressive for Muslim women. This apparent law on triple talaq had distorted the minds of the Muslim world. Now, they will see a new Muslim community growing up in India which will not have the fear of triple talaq among them.

With the abolition of this law, Muslim ladies will have the courage to report against their husbands, if they abuse or mistreat them.

Is the Supreme Court’s ruling that triple talaq violates the fundamental rights of Muslim women a great victory for progressive Muslims?

This is a great victory for every Muslim woman. The Supreme Court has held this decision to be arbitrary. Now, when it comes under the arbitrary category, this cannot come under the fundamental rights of a Muslim. I have not read the judgment in detail but there is six months’ time for the government to bring up detailed legislation.

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has been opposing the abolition of triple talaq. Do you think they are on the wrong side of history?

In 1986, their decision was different but in the Supreme Court whatever Kapil Sibal has said on their behalf, particularly the affidavit which was submitted when the arguments were concluded, is different. They have also recognised that it was an unjust practice and they want to abolish this practice.

The Muslim Personal Law Board had said that Parliament has the authority. If it wants to reform the laws, it has full rights to do so. Their new stand is totally different from the position they took in 1986.

Isn’t this decision a great step for gender equality?

Yes, absolutely. It will not only liberate Muslim women from the threat of triple divorce but it will also impart a sense of equality and empowerment.

Doesn’t this judgment by the apex court make Indian Muslim personal law more compatible with personal laws relating to marriage and divorce in orthodox Islamic countries?

Of course. Almost all Muslim countries have already got rid of this practice. Triple talaq was undoubtedly part of their practices earlier. Now, this law finds no standing in any court. Even Pakistan and Bangladesh which had the same laws on triple talaq had reformed their laws in the 1990s. It was high time, and thankfully India has done this now.

The last time triple talaq was held problematic in the Shah Bano case, it was overturned by Parliament and you resigned. Have your views been vindicated?

I don’t look at this whole issue from the view point of my personal vindication. I’m very happy that oppression and suppression which was being practised in the name of religion has come to an end.

Do you think that a section of Muslim clerics is holding back progressive reforms?

Try to understand the Muslim religion. My message is we should not hold back progressive reforms."

The Hacker Of GoT Season 7 Episode 4 Leaked It Because He Wanted To Please His Girlfriend!,"It happens only in India?!

The first time it happened with the fourth episode of Game of Thrones, the most hyped and loved American series that the entire episode was leaked online before its official release, and it happened in India.

The leaked episode had Star India’s watermark on it, which means that Hotstar who is HBO’s partner in India for airing the episode was responsible for the leak. Later it turned out that Prime Focus Technologies—the agency which manages Star India Private Limited’s data, is the root of the entire problem. Four people were arrested in the same regard and now one of them has revealed how it got revealed.

What was supposed to be a grave severe affair turned out to be rather funnier and realistic, to say the least.

So, now it has been revealed that one of the IT professionals named Alok Sharma who was under arrest in the same regard had sent the episode to his girlfriend in order to please her, and that is from where it was leaked and later uploaded online.

Twitter

“Initially, there were suspicions that one of the accused had accessed the episode as his girlfriend wanted to see it. The girlfriend had then passed it onto others, one of whom uploaded it online,” revealed an official to Indian Express who was part of the probe earlier.

“The investigation is still in progress. However, so far, it appears that they had leaked it for self-consumption. We are now trying to find out who uploaded it online,” another senior officer added.

ytimg.com

According to the report, first Alok had accessed the episode and it is he who shared it with the other four who are also under arrest. Police is trying to find out who uploaded it online.

Meanwhile, hackers responsible for the leak of the sixth episode have warned HBO that the finale episode will also be leaked before the actual air date.

"Amma’s children: Two AIADMK factions have merged, with a little help from BJP","The political turmoil that Tamil Nadu witnessed since the death of chief minister J Jayalalithaa has subsided for now, with a merger of the two AIADMK factions. The AIADMK (Amma) faction of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and the AIADMK (Puratchi Thalaivi Amma) group led by his predecessor O Panneerselvam have buried their differences and arrived at a compromise formula, both having agreed to nullify Sasikala’s appointment as party general secretary and keep her clan out of party affairs. The Palaniswami faction had already passed a resolution cancelling the appointment of her nephew TTV Dhinakaran as the deputy general secretary. Also worked out were the positions offered to team OPS.

BJP spotted in the churning a wonderful opportunity to make inroads into a state where non-Dravidian parties had only a minimal presence, and made the most of it. It is an open secret that it was BJP which orchestrated the sequence of events that led to the merger. In the process, it now has a vice-like grip over the united AIADMK, which is well aware of the threat to the stability of its government from a bruised Dhinakaran who purportedly has about 20 MLAs with him. The success of the BJP mission has dealt a body blow to DMK that was hoping AIADMK would disintegrate, paving the way for it to fill the vacuum. With the general election not far away, a weakened Congress-led UPA will now have to rethink its strategy.

It’s advantage BJP at this point. Save Karnataka, the south has always been a tough nut for BJP to crack. Its perseverance appears to be yielding fruit. However, in a state where Dravidianism is the bedrock of politics, it will be no mean task for the party to consolidate its position. Tamil Nadu could well be heading for yet another phase of uncertainty."
"Tired Of Eating Flesh, 'Cannibal' Surrenders Before Police After Walking In With Humans Limbs","In a bizarre incident, suspected cannibal surrendered to the police in South Africa to hand over human body parts – a leg and a hand – while telling officers: ‘I’m tired of eating human flesh.’

Reuters

According to reports, the man gave out a part of human leg and a hand as evidence. The evidence led to a house in KwaZulu-Natal where more body parts were found.

Nino Mbatha, Sthembiso Sithole, Lindokuhle Masondo and Lungisani Magubane were charged with murder and conspiracy, after one of them walked into a police station and announced that he was ‘tired of eating human flesh’. Nino Mbatha was a traditional ‘healer’, according to KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele.

Reuters

At a community meeting people said they had eaten human remains after they were given them by Mbatha as medicine.

The man who confessed to his crimes has reportedly raped, murdered, dismembered and even also eaten several women. Meanwhile, few other admitted to digging up graves on the instruction of Mbatha, and bringing him the bones they uncovered.

Reports also state that hundreds of people in a South African town have admitted to eating human flesh. More people were caught after four men were arrested for killing a woman and eating her body.

Why Siddaramaiah’s googly on Lingayats has put Narendra Modi and Amit Shah on a sticky wicket,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah’s combination of cultural nationalism and realpolitik has resulted in a disunited opposition at the national level. BJP seems to be on a new high after having tamed Bihar and Tamil Nadu to some extent. Yet there is one regional leader who has managed to keep the BJP’s nationalism at bay – Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah.

Last Saturday, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had exhorted the Lingayat and Veerashaiva community to set aside their differences and stay united in Karnataka. Lingayats form nearly 17% of the state’s electorate and have been BJP’s core vote-bank led by former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa. This should have had a sobering and uniting effect on both communities as per the prevailing mood at the national level. But Siddaramaiah’s Karnataka seems to defy the narrative much to the ire of BJP’s top brass.

Lakhs attend Lingayat rally, push for religion status https://t.co/u6u1AkGHta — TOI Bengaluru (@TOIBengaluru) August 23, 2017

Bhagwat’s call to unite resulted in over 100 representatives of Lingayat mutts organising a huge rally attended by over a lakh people in Belagavi this Tuesday. The RSS chief bore the major brunt of the attack for his statement at the rally where BJP leaders including Yeddyurappa were conspicuous by their absence. Leader after leader appealed that the community should not adhere to any political party, instead follow the teachings of the 12th century saint Basaveshwara, the founder of Lingayat community.

Now, memo exposes B S Yeddyurappa's doublespeak on Lingayats https://t.co/5Kfaj5xbFG via @TOIBengaluru pic.twitter.com/y7wh6IpXrn — Times of India (@timesofindia) July 29, 2017

Assembly elections are due in 2018 in the only major state in south where Congress is in power and BJP is keen to regain it. But Siddaramaiah has other plans. He has tactfully supported the demand for Lingayat to be given the status of an independent religion and asked some of his ministers to gauge the mood of the community on this issue. This has put Yeddyurappa and BJP in a catch-22 situation: if they support the demand, then it will put pressure on PM Modi to take a call; and if they don’t, BJP runs the risk of alienating the community which has been the bedrock of their politics in the state.

As Congress eyes Lingayats, Amit Shah reaches out to Vokkaliga bloc https://t.co/uXG1d9dA6k — TOI Bengaluru (@TOIBengaluru) August 14, 2017

Little wonder that Shah has termed this demand as Siddaramaiah’s divide and rule policy in the run up to the assembly elections."
Battle over quit India: Modi boisterously appropriates what Congress believes to be its family heirloom,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been thinking on his feet, as it were, on the issue of hitching his party to the bandwagon of freedom struggle. He is celebrating, with all the fervour that he can muster, the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement of 1942, the 70th anniversary of India’s independence, and he is planning grand celebrations for the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019 and the 75th anniversary of India’s independence in 2022.

It has become clear by now that Modi believes hugely in atmospherics. The main opposition party, Congress, feels left out and more than a little peeved by the PM’s boisterous appropriation of the freedom struggle, which the grand old party of India believes to be its family heirloom.

Congress leaders have always been contemptuous of the Hindu right-wing and they have forever taunted their ideological adversaries for having never taken part in the freedom struggle. Of course, the charge is unfair in historical terms. There were many who did not believe in the politics of agitation popularised by Mahatma Gandhi from 1920 onwards which placed the Congress party in the lead position, but who had been looking at other ways of gaining independence from British suzerainty.

The Muslim League was never part of the agitational approach of Gandhi’s Congress, and neither were many other sections like the Zamindars, the Unionist Party in Punjab, the Justice Party in the Madras presidency and the Krishak Samaj Party in Bengal. One of the prominent leaders who did not accept Gandhi’s extra-constitutional approach was BR Ambedkar.

So, if the case is to be argued as to whether people who did not court prison and raise anti-British slogans did not fight for freedom from the British, then it would be an argument that would be difficult to sustain. There were different political groups and each dealt with the British keeping in mind what they believed to be their own interests. There is little doubt that Congress had a broader viewpoint than all the others put together. It claimed to speak for the whole country, for all the groups and all the regions. The others contested the Congress claim to be representing all.

This was specially so in the case of Muslim League. The Hindu right-wingers were indeed in a quandary because they could not say that Congress did not represent the Hindu majority. As a matter of fact, the League dubbed the Congress as the party of the Hindus. There was no room in the arena for other Hindu sectional interests. Hindu Mahasabha leaders like MR Jayakar and Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya continued to exert influence in Congress. In a way, communal Hindu elements found a voice within Congress. Nehru and others were aware of this and greatly resented their presence.

Modi has turned the argument over whether one participated in the freedom struggle on its head by asserting that present day India ruled by BJP derives inspiration from the 1942 Quit India Movement to transform India. In contrast, all that Congress president Sonia Gandhi could bring herself to say was that it was Jawaharlal Nehru who had moved the Quit India resolution on August 9, 1942. Sonia was clutching a twig of history, while Modi took upon himself the burden of carrying the spirit of Quit India Movement, at least by way of rhetoric, to transform India of today.

Congress has now been reduced to a party which clings to memories of the past, invoking its heroism of long ago to seek solace in its bleak present and infuriated by the Modi strategy of appropriating the heritage of the freedom movement for BJP with much panache. It can be said that Modi’s words and gestures sound hollow because he does not really believe in the Gandhian morality of loving the adversary. And most importantly, he is not able to come to terms with Gandhi’s proclaimed political heir, Nehru.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee had no hesitation in looking up to the Nehruvian legacy because Vajpayee had greater self-confidence than Modi does. The prime minister’s belligerence in what he says and what he does not say betrays a brittle sense of his own self. But he is moving in the right direction by acknowledging loudly and clearly events like the Quit India Movement which was essentially a Congress ploy.

It can be seen in retrospect that the Quit India Movement was a historical blunder because the Muslim League and others became stronger between 1942 and 1945. Many Congress leaders, including Nehru, were not comfortable with Gandhi’s decision. Though it was a tactical blunder, Gandhi was right in going ahead with it because all the Congress leaders were imprisoned, and when they came out of prison at the end of the war, they were burnished heroes who had paid the price for refusing to go with the British war effort.

But no Congress leader of the day ever showed any resentment towards the bureaucracy, towards the Indian armed forces who participated in World War II, nor with the industrialists and many others from different walks of life who were not in the Quit India Movement. Congress in 1945 carried everyone else with it. Modi seems to be trying to appropriate the legacy of the freedom struggle with barely a nod towards Congress. Congress’s anger is palpable."

"From Shabana Azmi To Farhan Akhtar, Bollywood Applauds Supreme Court's Ruling On Triple Talaq","For long, Muslim women have been fighting against the Triple Talaq attempting to seek justice, and yesterday when the Supreme Court ruled the practice as unconstitutional, it seemed like the women of the nation achieved a milestone in their fight for their rights.

While there were some people who weren’t happy, others hailed the decision of the Supreme Court. And so did the Hindi film industry. From Shabana Azmi to Farhan Akhtar and others, the entire Bollywood industry applauded the decision.

wikimedia.org

“The Supreme Courts judgement against instant triple talaq is a welcome measure. Triple talaq in one go does not have religious sanction and is patently unjust and anti-women. More than 20 Muslim countries have banned it and it has no place in secular India,” Shabana Azmi told TOI.

socialsamosa.com

Farhan Akhtar also expressed his happiness on the same.

“The way the society is moving forward, the focus that is there on women’s rights and equality, and the fight for gender equality. It is very healthy that such a decision has been made. Now there is a six month window to figure out how it should be translated into a law, I hope it happens. Because it is a very archaic practice, it is time for it to go.”

Several other celebs also tweeted about the SC’s judgement.

A delightful 3-course Mediterranean meal,"Tart tatin

A delightful upside-down version of apple pie



Ingredients

50 g unsalted butter

1/2 vanilla pod, seeds only

50 g caster sugar

150 g puff pastry

6 apples, peeled, cored and halved



Method

Preheat the oven to 200° C. Press the butter and vanilla seeds into an oven-safe pan, so that the base is covered. Sprinkle with sugar and shake to spread evenly. Set aside.

Roll the pastry out on a floured work surface to a 3 to 4 mm thickness and cut one disk 1 to 2 cm bigger than the diameter of the pan. Leave in refrigerator to rest.

Arrange the apples in the pan, with the narrowest side of the apple on the bottom. Leave two pieces of apple to insert later.

Place the pan over low heat and caramelise until it becomes dark all round. Carefully add the remaining apple pieces as the cooked ones shrink.

Remove pan from heat and put the puff pastry on top. Using a spoon, tuck the pastry along the sides of the apples.

Place the saucepan on an oven tray, and bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes. If your pastry is very thick it will require a longer cooking time.

Let the tart tatin rest for 5 to 8 minutes, cover with a serving dish, and quickly turn the pan upside down to turn out the tart tatin.

Serve with ice cream.

"Singer Toshi Defends Niece’s Viral Video, Says She’s Stubborn & Needs To Be Pushed To Study!","There’s a thin line between funny and crying for help, they say. Not everyone gets to know when they’re close to crossing over.

Sometimes we don’t realise what we’re doing for the sake of fun, maybe, is causing mental torture on the other person. However, this time it was a kid, a three-year-old girl, who was being taught maths, particularly the numbers, and her failure to recall them surrounded her with torture and mental assault.

Screengrab

Many had laughed at the viral video earlier until Virat Kohli shared it and made people realise that what seems funny is blatant mental torture. Thereafter, a trail of celebrities also dissed the video sending out a message to the people that innocence of the kids shall not be assaulted by any means.

The fact that the pain and anger of the child is ignored and ones own ego to make the child learn is so massive that compassion has totally gone out of the window. This is shocking and saddening to another dimension. A child can never learn if intimidated. This is hurtful. A post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat.kohli) on Aug 18, 2017 at 10:08pm PDT

Days after the video went viral, it has been revealed that the kid belonged to a celebrity family. She is the niece of singer and music composer duo Sharib and Toshi. But what’s sad is that the singer instead of accepting where things went wrong is defending it all.

dancing with my darling😍😍😍#gypsyking👊👊👊 A post shared by Sharib Sabri (@sharibsabri) on Feb 21, 2016 at 10:59pm PST

In an interview to Hindustan Times, Toshi said, “Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan don’t know about us. Hamare bachche ke bare mein humein pata hai naah ki hamara bacha kaisa hai! Uska nature hai waisa… Agle hi pal woh khelne chali jaati hai. Agar aap usko chod do toh woh kahengi main mazzak kar rahi thi. Uske nature ki wajah se chod denge toh woh padai bhi nahi kar paayengi.”

YouTube

Furthermore, he says that the child is stubborn and that they cannot stop educating her just because she cries.

Toshi, you’ve done more damage than good. This certainly does not defend the mental pain she had gone through. She’s just a three-year-old and having suffered this at this tender age, we hope it doesn’t impact her personality in future.

Kids shall not be pressurised for anything. The innocent souls shall never lose their smile.

The Making Video Of The Ice Battle In Game Of Thrones S7 Episode 6 Will Make Your Jaw Drop!,"The last episode of The Game of Thrones has raised the expectation level of the audiences and the wait for the finale seems tougher. While fans called episode 6 by far the best of the season, there was a lot that went behind while filming the ice battle, which resulted in the killing of one of Daenerys Targaryen's dragons by the Night King.

It was an epic battle between Jon and his team and the army of the dead, the White Walkers. And it became even more intense when the battle was joined by Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons.

YouTube/GameOfThrones

As you may have guessed, the episode was high on visual effects and computer generated imagery. Now, HBO has released the behind the scenes video, in which the director, cast as well as the crew reveals what efforts and hardships they went through while filming the scene.

YouTube/GameOfThrones

The writers reveal how they always wanted to have a zombie bear in the series but had to wait long enough before they got the approval from the special effects team, and it was only in the last episode that they could finally make it through.

YouTube/GameOfThrones

The Belfast’s Wolf Hill Quarry was temporarily transformed into a fake ice lake, where the epic battle was shot. For some of the scenes, the cast as well the crew had to travel to Iceland through trucks and jeeps and shoot in the icy cold weather.

To have a better understanding of how these scenes were shot and how the dragons came to life, watch the making video below:

Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech: farmers still waiting for achhe din,"Listening to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on Independence Day when he spoke at length about welfare of farmers gave one a feeling of déjà vu. It was almost as if one was transported to early 2014 when the Lok Sabha election campaign was in full swing. During that entire campaign, Modi had made it a point to reiterate his commitment towards welfare of farmers. Three years later Modi has ushered GST and demonetisation which has changed the basic fundamentals of Indian economy, but his government’s apathy towards agriculture which constitute 54.6% of India’s total work force remains unchanged.

Consider the speeches before Modi became Prime Minister in which he promised that farmers would make a minimum of 50% profit on their produce. He assured farmers that after taking into account their input cost of seed, water, electricity, fertilizer, medicines, and labour etc., the new dispensation would add a flat 50% over and above it to decide the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of crops. Three years later farmer unrest continues in large parts of the country forcing some state governments to intervene and offer loan-waivers.

The farmers need our support. They have been benefited by the various schemes launched by the government: PM Modihttps://t.co/EJUKnzWeiE pic.twitter.com/jff0gHrlLg — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 15, 2017

In his speech from Red Fort, Modi went on to list his government’s achievements of how the number of farmers covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has gone up from 3.25 crore to 5.75 crore. Even though Modi’s intentions may be to ensure that farmers are covered under some sort of financial security, but it is an uphill task for farmers to avail benefits due to many technicalities of PMFBY rules. This is directly proportionate to the growth of non-life general insurance companies at the expense of farmers. These companies grew at 32% from Rs 96,376 crore in 2015–16 to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in 2016–17 as per reports.

farmers suicide in India: Over 12,000 farmer suicides per year, Centre tells Supreme Court #MyNewIndia https://t.co/pY5mXmI9BU — काकावाणी (@AliSohrab007) August 13, 2017

Rural distress is evident in the significantly high figure of 6867 farm suicides mainly from five states in 2016 as per reports. Comparatively, this is more than half of total figures from five states in 2015 when farmers faced severe drought for the second consecutive year. Even though government has claimed that farmer suicides are declining, the number of reported suicide cases has belied their claim. Modi too has shifted goal posts by promising to double farm income by 2022 – a promise prominently mentioned in BJP’s 2014 manifesto."
Learn from Khatauli – the habits of ‘jugaad’ and ‘chalta hai’ are incompatible with rail safety,"Prima facie it appears that the train derailment at Khatauli on Saturday, mangling up the Utkal Express, could have been avoided, if the prescribed mandatory operating procedure had been observed.

Preliminary enquiries suggest that after detecting a crack in a ‘glued joint’ the engineering staff asked for a 20 minute ‘block’ for repairs, yet the repair work was taken up without authority – in gross violation of the safety protocol.

Indian Railways’ general and subsidiary rules lay down that, in case of emergency, repairs to the track may be carried out after taking mandatory precautions such as exhibiting ‘Stop’ signals. Further, a senior engineering official must first bring the train to a stop and advise the train driver through a written memo about the need to stop the train, and simultaneously arrange to send a message to the station master and obtain his written confirmation. This essential drill was not followed and elementary safety norms were violated.

Pending a detailed probe by the commissioner of railway safety, in a rather unprecedented move, a central government secretary level technocrat – member of the railway board in charge of the engineering department – has been summarily sent on leave, along with the two top jurisdictional officers – the general manager of the northern railway zone and the divisional railway manager of the Delhi division. In addition, the zonal chief track engineer has been moved out on transfer, while the senior divisional engineer, among other junior engineering officials, has been suspended.

Much as the swift and stern action by government underlines its stated ‘zero tolerance for unsafe rail operations’, the fact remains that most political dispensations have followed warped priorities with respect to the nation’s lifeline, leaving it battered and bruised.

Elsewhere in the world, today technology enables fatality-free rail travel. Japan’s Shinkansen ‘bullet’ trains have been operating without fatality for over 50 years. These technologies demand a modern mindset, appropriate management structure, and skilled workforce. With more than 85% of its train accidents ascribed to ‘human failure’, IR has also been constantly investing in newer technologies, mechanisation of maintenance, upgradation of track structure, including higher capacity long welded rails, their ultrasonic testing, on-track and digital machines, and electronic monitoring of track geometry.

With highly expensive and sophisticated equipment steadily ploughed into IR, along with myriad technological aids increasingly made available for maintenance, the extent of assets failures that still occur is unacceptable. IR’s assets failures, jeopardising safety, show a disturbing trend: rail track fractures and weld failures increased from 3,237 in 2015-16 to 3,546 in 2016-17; diesel and electric locomotives failures remained at about the level of 4,500 in the year, and detachment of passenger coaches from trains run in excess of 810; failures of overhead electric wires increased from 378 in 2015-16 to 447 in 2016-17; signalling equipment failures were of the order of 1,30,200 in 2016-17.

While the enquiry commissioned by IR will establish the cause of Saturday’s accident, safety is itself symptomatic of operational efficiency and discipline, to be viewed as integral to all operations. The glaring fault lines of the Khatauli accident expose IR’s silo-based set-up, where departmental compartmentalisation loses sight of the overall organisational goals including safety.

The Anil Kakodkar led rail safety committee report echoed the prevalent public perception of IR’s creeping infirmities: “Centralised, top heavy and hierarchical along departmental lines.” It also emphasised the status quo ante to be restored for senior general management posts, to be manned only by those well versed in train operation, much like the senior command posts in the defence establishment are filled mostly by the fighting arms.

Still the non-implementation bug bites, not IR alone; and selective amnesia has been government’s forte. It is definitely time for change, for a new way of thinking in the rail industry, to enable IR to regain primacy in the country’s transport domain, to become the economy’s engine of growth. There should be no place for an attitude of just ‘jugaad’, or, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stressed, of ‘chalta hai’."

Here’s A Bacteria That Could Potentially Boost Athletic Performance!,"Been trying to boost your athletic performance but don't know how? Scientists have recently identified a bacteria that inhabit the digestive tracts of runners and rowers that may aid in improving your athletic performance. The bacteria is set to be used to develop probiotic applications that aid in performance and recovery.

Twitter/Representational Image

The results showed that the bacteria that inhabit the digestive tracts of the athletes may help develop probiotic supplements that could help them, and even amateur fitness enthusiasts, recover from a tough workout or more efficiently convert nutrients to energy.

""We are more bacteria than we are human. The bugs in our gut affect our energy metabolism, making it easier to breakdown carbohydrates, protein and fibre,"" said Jonathan Scheiman, a post-doctoral student at Harvard Medical School.

NewsX/Representational Image

""They are also involved in inflammation and neurological functions. So perhaps the microbiome could be relevant for applications in endurance, recovery and maybe even mental toughness,"" Scheiman added.

For the study, presented at the 254th National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Washington, the team collected fecal samples on a daily basis from 20 athletes training for the 2015 Boston Marathon, to capture how the microbiome changes between performance and recovery.

When they compared the pre-race and post-race samples, the researchers found a sudden spike in the population of one particular type of bacteria after the marathon.

Facebook/Representational Image

""This bug's natural function is to breakdown lactic acid,"" Scheiman said.

During intense exercise, the body produces more lactic acid than usual, which can lead to muscle fatigue and soreness. This bacteria could potentially help with that.

The researchers are now feeding the bacteria to mice to measure its effects on lactic acid levels and fatigue.

Twitter/Representational Image

In another experiment, the researchers compared the bacteria from ultra-marathoners to those found in rowers training for the Olympics.

They found a type of bacteria in ultra-marathoners that can help breakdown carbohydrates and fibre—which is key during a 100-mile run—that was not present in the rowers, suggesting that different sports may foster niche microbiomes.

Criminal negligence: Utkal Express derailment highlights deep rot in railways’ processes,"The derailment of Utkal Express in Khatauli, UP, that has claimed 23 lives, highlights yet again the abysmal state of railway safety. That the mishap occurred due to unofficial repair work on the track, without a proper time block for maintenance, exposes the culture of negligence that has seeped into the mass mover. No speed restriction warning was put at the maintenance spot just so delays wouldn’t reflect poorly on the performance report of the division and zone. This is far more dangerous than any infrastructure issue, as it represents a breakdown of basic systems and processes.

Suspensions and transfers may not be enough to send a strong message on accountability for the disaster; those found responsible should be tried for criminal negligence. A quick look at the statistics reveals a shocking state of affairs. The 2016-17 period saw more people die in derailments than in any of the last 17 years. And of the 586 rail accidents in the last five years, around 53% were due to derailments. Plus, the arrears of track renewal are constantly mounting leading to disproportionately high maintenance effort. It appears that maintenance simply can’t keep up with requirement, forcing short cuts that inevitably compromise safety.

Add to this the administrative structure of the railways that prevents proper safety oversight. The railway board is rule maker, operator and regulator at the same time. This prevents accountability from being fixed. The need of the hour is an independent and empowered regulator, outside the ambit of the railway ministry, to audit rail safety. In addition to existing safety issues, the railways also needs to be aware of non-conventional threats such as terrorism. The Kanpur train accident last November that led to the deaths of more than 140 people has been blamed on sabotage. Probes and committee reports on such cases need to be put out in the public domain and preventive measures taken.

The current NDA dispensation may be good at painting and selling big visions like that of bullet trains, but what the railways desperately needs is better implementation of routine procedures on the ground. Railway minister Suresh Prabhu did well to begin his innings by not giving into the populist tendency to announce new trains. However, his track record in turning the mass mover into an efficient and safe outfit has been below expectations so far."
Tiger Shroff Saves Rumoured Girlfriend Disha Patani From An Embarrassing Moment On The Ramp!,"It has, for long, been rumoured that Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani have been dating but the couple has kept what's between them under wraps. Often they have been spotted together and the rumours thereafter spread like wildfire.

Recently, the alleged couple attended the Lakme Fashion Week together, and what happened there was rather cute that fans have been fawning over.

Just like Tiger Shroff, Disha Patani was also supposed to walk the runway but she didn't. Why, you ask? Because Tiger saved her from what could have been a major embarrassing moment.

So, before the diva walked the ramp, Tiger figured out that the stage was made up of a reflective glass, and her alleged girlfriend was wearing a short dress. Being a keen observer of thing or just being a caring boyfriend, Tiger was seen muttering something into her ears and thereafter she decided not to walk the ramp.

Isn't that cute?

Earlier as well, the alleged couples of the B-town have saved their girlfriends from such awkward moments. Remember, how once, Salman told Katrina to cover up her neck while at a press conference through Alia Bhatt.

Also, how once Singh Rajput saved Kriti Sanon from a probable wardrobe malfunction?

That's indeed cute, isn't it?

Triple talaq: Removing gender injustice would only strengthen minority rights in India,"Triple talaq has been quashed by the Supreme Court. A small step for gender equality and in the slow march of the Indian polity towards realising the principles of liberal democracy that guide the Constitution. And a gleeful leap for joy for those whose political project is to put ‘pampered minorities’ in their place.

Yet, the ideal of a uniform civil code for the entire country remains a distant goal. It cannot come by a court ruling and the political will to legislate one is conspicuous by its absence.

At a time when vigilantism is on the rise and a deceased suspect in the killing of a man on the suspicion that he stored beef in his fridge is honoured as a martyr, you cannot blame anyone for seeing pursuit of a uniform civil code as a move to further disfranchise religious minorities.

For Muslim Women

To put things in perspective, this is not the first time a personal law has been modified by the courts, to advance the cause of gender equality.

Notably, the Kerala High Court had struck down provisions of the Christian personal law that denied women the right to a share of their parental property, without inviting any wrathful shower of fire and brimstone on the court or condemning one of the world’s earliest group of Christians to eternal damnation.

The majority of Muslims would welcome a formal end to the practice of triple talaq, but would be unhappy that the courts have interfered in what they have been led to believe is a matter of their faith. This is something that the political class must engage with.

The five-member Constitution bench did not reach a unanimous decision on the matter. The three judges who supported quashing triple talaq did not follow the selfsame logic to reach that decision. Two held this provision of the Muslim personal law to be arbitrary and, therefore, violative of the Constitution. One held the provision to be bad in law because the overwhelming purport of Quranic injunctions on divorce is for fair treatment of the woman.

The two judges who gave the minority view that it requires legislation rather than a court decision to remove triple talaq also strongly disapproved of the practice. Triple talaq is the third and most undesirable form of divorce, even in the eyes of those who deem the practice to be legal. But the first two also fail the test of gender equity: they give men the unilateral right to divorce their wives, even if over an extended period of time that offers scope for reconciliation, rather than instantaneously.

The judges have thrown the door open for challenging the two remaining methods of divorce in the Muslim personal law on grounds of violating the right to equality. The chief justice, one of the authors of the minority view, specifically referred to the government counsel’s statement that the first two methods of divorce, talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan, too privilege the male and, thus, violate the right to equality, while calling upon the legislature to find a remedy by changing the law.

Champions of gender justice or those who would like to remove any provision for men to seek divorce in the Muslim personal law, to force the legislature to take up a fresh law, could challenge talaq-e-ahsan and talaqe-hasan, also, on grounds of discrimination against women.

For Muslims as a Whole

Too long has the polity been made to accept the make-believe that faith is a valid reason to deny some sections of the citizenry the full range of rights they are entitled to under democracy.

Democracy is the bedrock of minority rights in a polity. Any attempt to carve out democracy-less enclaves for followers of a minority faith ends up eroding minority rights and degrades democracy in general.

When the king of ancient Kochi sheltered Jews, Christians, Muslims and a host of other non-Hindu communities in his Hindu kingdom, he did so on the strength of royal patronage, and a social tradition of accommodating multiple gods and forms of worshipping them. Multiple non-Hindu communities were free to live according to their custom, so long as they did not interfere with the working of the state.

In modern India, state patronage is not the basis for multi-cultural coexistence. The basis is now a collectionof rights codified in the Constitution.

And the reason why Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees citizens the freedom to profess, practice and propagate the religion of their choice, subject only to public order, morality and health, apart from other fundamental rights, is that what distinguishes democracy from majoritarianism: the majority cannot use their numerical strength to take away the rights of the minorities.

The stronger democracy as a whole, the stronger the protection of minority rights. Conversely, the weaker democracy gets, the greater the threat to minority rights.

Denying women democratic rights in the name of protecting religious custom weakens democracy and erodes minority rights. Endangering minority rights to defend medieval patriarch would be the most egregious mistake of all."
Forever expunged: Sanctity bestowed on personal laws ensured triple talaq escaped legal gaze for far too long,"The Supreme Court judgment declaring illegal talaq-e-biddat or triple talaq – the practice of instant, unilateral and irrevocable divorce – ends a source of injustice that put certain sections of Sunni Muslim women at a great disadvantage. By a 3:2 majority SC ruled that this form of talaq is “manifestly arbitrary”, allowing marital ties to be “capriciously and whimsically” broken by a Muslim man, and violated Article 14 of the Constitution guaranteeing equal protection of the law to men and women. With no chance for reconciliation, many Muslim women have found themselves destitute, with no recourse available in civil law.

The majority verdict attempts a delicate balancing act between individual rights enshrined in Article 14 and religious freedoms guaranteed by Article 25. While Justice Joseph found that triple talaq was against the mandate of Quran and therefore impermissible, Justices Nariman and Lalit also made the more fundamental argument that triple talaq violated Article 14 and therefore needed to be struck down. Since marriage is a civil institution, Article 14 ought to have precedence over Article 25 in case there is conflict between the two. Interestingly, the Union government wanted the court to ban all forms of talaq which none of the judges agreed to. But the government can take credit for lending its immense clout to the Muslim women who approached SC against triple talaq.

It was a colonial era law, Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, that surrendered jurisdiction on matters of marriage, divorce, succession and maintenance including talaq to clerics who later banded under the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). But Justice Nariman rightly cited the Constitution’s Article 13(1) which demands that all colonial-era laws not in consonance with fundamental rights be struck down. This is an important intervention. Matters concerning fundamental rights cannot be left to personal law bodies like the arch-conservative AIMPLB.

It is tempting to see the judgment as a body blow to personal laws and politicise it. This is not only incorrect but also dangerous. Rather than an affront to any particular religion it must be viewed as a pit stop in the path towards progressive and egalitarian changes in society. Many Muslim majority countries including Indonesia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, have rejected talaq-e-biddat. The government’s emphasis must now shift to ensuring universal marriage registration and reforming personal laws in consultation with community groups to ensure equal rights for men and women in marriage, divorce and alimony."
Sunil Joshi appointed Bangladesh's spin consultant,"EXPERIENCE COUNTS

Sunil Joshi appointed Bangladesh's spin consultant

While Australia have gone back to hiring the services of S Sriram, who helped their spinners during the India series earlier in the year, Bangladesh have added to their contingent, former India spinner Sunil Joshi, who has been roped in as the spin consultant for the immediate future.

The former slow left-armer confirmed the development to Cricbuzz but refused to divulge details of the duration of his service with Bangladesh's national side. ""Yes, I will be working as the spin consultant for the Australia series, and will be joining the (Bangladesh) side shortly,"" Joshi told Cricbuzz.

With Bangladesh having shown drastic improvements as a Test team in the last year,. the forthcoming two-match series marks a big opportunity for them to register their maiden Test win over Australia. It would be no surprise that they would bank on their strength, which also happens to be Australia's biggest weakness - spin.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board had gone all out in search of a spin consultant for the series, including the possibility of having Stuart MacGill in their coaching setup.

With the former Australian legspinner declining to take up the role due to illness, BCB turned towards Joshi, with whom they had earlier tried to initiate talks for the role of a bowling coach.

Joshi, who has played 15 Tests and 69 ODIs for India, was the Man of the Match in Bangladesh's first ever Test in 2000. He had scored 92 in his only innings and bagged eight wickets in the match, including a fifer.

Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
11 Corrective Measures India Can Adopt To Make Its Trains Safer For Passengers,"After two train accidents in a span of just five days, India's Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu has offered to resign. He took ""full moral responsibility"" on Twitter for the mishaps after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has asked him to 'wait'.

Nearly 20 people lost their lives and over 200 were injured on Saturday when 13 coaches of the Puri-Haridwar Utkal Express derailed in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar district.

ap

Today, 10 coaches of Kaifiyat Express en route New Delhi derailed after it collided with a dumper in Uttar Pradesh near the district of Auraiya. Over 70 people were injured in the accident.

Taking these accidents into account, and several others that have occurred in the past, we look at 11 steps that can help Indian Railways in making its trains safer for passengers.

1. Railways tracks

India needs more railway tracks that frees up line capacity, mitigating the traffic on existing routes. The chances of collision will automatically be reduced if the existing traffic is diffused to other lines. Adding more tracks will also boost the speed of the trains.

bccl

2. Hiring more workers

Unmanned level crossings is a major concern in India. Hiring more workers would ensure the safety of such crossings where human population intersects with that of a travelling train. Since India is home to hundreds of such crossings, having flagmen and safety personnel stationed here would definitely aid in reducing the number of mishaps.

3. Positive train control

Positive train control is a technology that leverages the use of GPS, Wi-Fi, and radio signals to foresee something on the track ahead. The technology can help prevent accidents by bringing a train to a halt before it gets into trouble. So if an engineer fails to stop at a signal or if the train is moving too fast, with positive train control the brakes can be pushed to stop the train from derailing or hitting another.

bccl

4. Regular check-ups

Accidents don't always happen due to human error; sometimes the fault is in the tracks or the locomotive itself. This is where check-ups play an important role in figuring out the wear and tear. Rail equipment should also always be tuned-up to prevent accidents.

5. Crumple zones

When a car gets into an accident, its hood is designed so that it crumples up and absorbs maximum damage to protect its passengers. It has been harder to figure out similar designs for trains, and the cost of smashing huge rail cars can get expensive very quickly. Many new trains are equipped with this feature, which is called crash energy management. Fortunately, computers have played an important role in gauging crash scenarios and the response of a railcar, allowing engineers to design crumple zones.

6. Drones

Drones can help respond to emergencies. In cases of train accidents, drones can help first responders gauge the scenario better - the kind of heat, chemical or other risks they may find themselves walking into. Drones can deliver sensor readings before a rescuer puts on a suit and walks into the disaster.

7. High-speed transit

Behind Japan's famed Shinkansen train lines is the brain of a computer system that manages everything from scheduling to dispatching trains, and manning the crews and trains available to rescheduling them. A similar response system can work wonders for Indian Railways.

afp

8. Satellite stop signals

A satellite navigation system called SafeRail from the European Space Agency is working toward enabling train drivers to track their location in real-time and send a signal that can trigger a stop light or lower a gate at a train crossing. This can aid in reducing human errors and subsequently accidents.

9. Tougher rail cars

Freight trains carrying hazardous material could do well with tougher rail cars that can withstand disastrous mishaps. What's sturdier even than steel is a fibreglass composite that is highly puncture-resistant and can mitigate the magnitude of an accident with a passenger train.

bccl

10. Maintaining track conditions

Many countries' railways use advanced instruments to inspect every aspect of track geometry. These technologies can predict the response of trains to any deviations in track geometry, enabling railway systems to determine when a track needs maintenance.

11. Driverless trains

Similar to driverless cars, autonomous trains can bring their own set of advantages. They can reduce human error and manage mass transit in big countries like India. All operations on board a train can be managed by remote technologies, including the ones that track trains and potential hazards.

bccl

In a country as massive as India, these various aspects can work in tandem to improve train and passenger safety to a great extent. After all, saving lives is a priority that should never be compromised with."

Donald Trump’s latest Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy: Not much South Asian comfort,"By Pinaki Bhattacharya

It was touted as the latest US strategy towards South Asia. And, we were told by US Secretary of Defence James Mattis, that the Camp David meeting last weekend was a culmination of many months of review of US policies for the Afghanistan quagmire. So, expectations were high in the four capitals of Kabul, Islamabad, New Delhi and Beijing.

But US President Donald J Trump let South Asia down. He talked about an increased US commitment to Afghanistan — more boots on the ground. There were no numbers mentioned of fresh troop deployment, for that is a potential minefield in hyper-ventilating Washington.

US House of Representative SpeakerPaul Ryan, who was briefed earlier about what to expect from Trump’s current trumpeteering, almost called it prescient that the US President has called the latest strategy to be not time-based but “based on condition” —which means, as Trump explained, “condition on the ground”.

Lessons on conflict resolution state that one needs to divine an acceptable‘ end state’ before one sets the conflict-machine chugging. But it seems that Republican presidencies have not learnt the studied moves of the Nixon-Kissinger team. Instead, they seem as expansive as the Reagan administration that was too busy defeating the Soviet Union, thus making itself hostage to the Chinese economic miracle.

Which meant Ronald Reagan’s successor, George H W Bush, losing his presidency to ‘It’s the economy, stupid!’ rhetoric of Bill Clinton. The burgeoning US public debt that Beijing continued to feed — as reflected in the trade surpluses — shows in the lack of ‘strategic autonomy’ that Washington had enjoyed since World War 2.

George W Bush tried his hand in unilateralism, but ended up going down in American history books as a creator of not one, but two Vietnam wars in Af-Pak and Iraq.

Trump’s speech was devoid of any substance that could stir up the Indian subcontinent’s own ‘studio empire-builders’ to reach for their TV microphones.

And what did Trump tell Pakistan that could make the tinpot generals of Rawalpindi quake in their boots? “In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America’s interests are clear: we must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter.”

Boilerplate words those. Thus, shorn of the finesse of a leader like Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s generals would rather have Beijing continuing its indulgence and play mediator for them.

Trump’s speech does very little for the confidence level of New Delhi, which is watching each muscle of the latest actor on the stage of Indo-US relations. There will be a holding operation that would be launched in New Delhi in the wake of this speech.

Not much extra commitment of India’s foreign exchange dollars will flow that Trump was hopeful of steering to Afghanistan. Of course India wouldbe doing its ‘best’. But that ‘best’ would fall short of Trump’s expectations.

So, this speech was really about the domestic audience: not Trump’s own white- and blue-collar electoral base, but the Establishment, whose leading lights are now firmly in the Indiancamp.

This was evident in the penultimate days of the Barack Obama administration when former Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter got the ‘blank cheque’ of the Defence Authorisation Act passed by the US Congress. That may have evoked some fraught memories. But Pentagon can play around with it, military-industrial complex or no military-industrial complex."
Three cheers for folks who made the 70th bash possible,"On this cusp of another anniversary of Indian independence, I would like us to remember the people who made it possible. The worthies who have made this nation and built its institutions: I mean the leaders of the RSS and the BJP.

Who can forget all of their people who went willingly to jail and spent years there? Long years in isolation, while they wrote terrific texts, like the Discovery of Hindu India. And what sacrifices they made. For example there was that RSS man… actually, he apologised to the Brits and got out of jail. Then there was that other BJP man… wait, he apologised too. Anyway, I am sure a name will come to me soon. There were so many of them who resisted the foreigner while proudly waving the mono-colour.

And of course their contributions continued after Independence. The building of institutions, which we can see all around us and which have benefited Indians for decades. Like the Indian Institutes of Technology, modelled on MIT and founded in 1951 (I believe by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad).

And the Indian Institutes of Management, set up in 1961 by the Bajrang Dal. The IIM is the pride of the middle class that today for some reason spits on its founder. The Sahitya Akademi was founded in 1954, by the Gau Rakshaks, the National Institute of Design in 1961, by the Durga Vahini. And then of course the giants of the public sector.

I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, that it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch that established the public sector companies we call, presumably because they are valuable, the Navratnas. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (1964), Oil and National Gas Commission (1956), National Thermal Power Corporation (1975), Steel Authority of India (1954), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (1964), Indian Oil Corporation (1959). The list goes on. Why were all these set up?

I said to my father: “This is fine and all but ultimately useless. What’s the point of all this socialism? Wasn’t it obvious to them that they should just have privatised everything!”

He said: “You’re right. Except that there was nothing to privatise, beta. Someone thought about and built these things from zero. They were essential for industrialising a poor nation with a peasant economy. And at a time when few Indians had access to capital, and there were no Gujarati billionaires to just hand the stuff over to. It required work from the ground up. Building institutions is not for everyone.”

Nations are not built by speeches, he says, but I am not convinced. All this clinging to institutions smacks of sentimentalism. I was delighted to be informed that this country became a nuclear power, whether the softies like it or not, in 1974, under the BJP and while the opposition was resisting.

Speaking of the good stuff, that is to say hard nationalism, we must turn to our performance in the military field. There was a time when this country could win wars. Real ones with real territory and tens of thousands of captured enemy, not fake ones in TV studios. Today we go into rapture over skirmishes about which no details are revealed. That was not always so and we should thank the BJP for the memories of those victories.

Let us turn to the pragmatic side of the party. On realising that change was needed, we had the economic reforms of the early 1990s. The BJP championed those in the Lok Sabha, if I am not mistaken. And all this while the opposition was resisting modernity. It is for this reason that the 10 years of UPA saw a pathetic 8% growth while the NDA has consistently delivered a majestic 7%. Kitna deti hai? is the question never asked of our economy. But again, who needs data when you are obviously burning with intent to do well?

Most of all I am moved to tears by the BJP’s martyrdoms. The Prime Minister said that three generations had sacrificed themselves so that he could become PM in a Lok Sabha with a BJP majority.

Yes. A lot of sacrificing was done by BJP leaders. One of them died at the hands of her bodyguards, whom she trusted. Another, only a few years later, was killed by assassins he chose to mingle with. Such offerings to the nation which other party has made?

I wonder if those who today accuse the BJP of being anti-national and unpatriotic consider the fact that the history of that party has been written with the blood of its martyred leaders.

I doubt that they do. We are a people for whom it is easy for history to be elastic. We can have Pratap defeat Akbar, we can convert the Taj into a temple. What is a little thing like Independence and what has been achieved since? It is the time of fake news and fake history. We are fortunate that the same people who achieved all those things are still at the helm."
Unsafe as houses: Watch out – your dream home could become a nightmare 😜,"Most Indians dream of owning a home. And, if recent developments are anything to go by, the chances are that their dream home will remain just that: a dream.

Real estate developers – including some really big boys in the business – are collapsing like a house of cards.

Some have declared insolvency as they are unable to repay banks and others whom they’ve borrowed money from. Others have left their projects only partly finished and unfit for occupation.

Indeed, if all the delays in construction across the country were to be totted up they’d probably add up to a time when folks didn’t live in houses, but in caves.

And perhaps the time will come – if it hasn’t already – when people may have to do just that: Wanted for immediate occupation 2 BHK goofa, bijli-pani optional. Brokers welcome.

Many of those who’ve been left literally home-less have invested their life savings in a place to call their own which now seems more remote and out of reach than the surface of another planet.

In fact that unearthly analogy might be only too apt. Because one of the reasons why the real estate sector is in such a mess, that it should more appropriately be redesignated the unreal estate sector, is that many developers got so greedy that they used up all the money they’d collected for Project A to buy up land on which to start Project B, leaving Project A half-finished, if that.

This Operation Landgrab was of such a scale that the recently introduced Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) might well uncover pie-in-the-sky housing projects based on the Moon, or Mars, the Earth having run out of space.

In the meantime, many who’ve put their hard-earned money into owning a home are being made to learn the origin of the phrase to be ‘flat broke’: buy a flat, and become totally broke."

Government must develop its ‘human capital’ akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

This Free Smartphone App Replaces Expensive Hearing Aids For People Suffering From Hearing Loss,"Losing your hearing can be a real problem, and if you’re young it’s twice as embarrassing. It doesn’t matter that it’s a medical condition, no one under the age of 50 would be comfortable being spotted with an earpiece.

And that’s exactly why MobileEars believes there’s a market out there for their unique product. The company markets it as an “affordable and attractive” solution for people with hearing loss, especially those in a younger age bracket.

“More people today will lose their hearing earlier than our ancestors’” says VP of sales and marketing for Listen AS (MobileEars' parent company), Arjun Bhatt. He believes one of the main problems with hearing aids in the market today is that they each cost between Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000. To top it off, hearing loss is not covered by most health insurance plans, and the doctor consults are expensive. Another major issue, is the stigma associated with wearing the earpiece needed to return hearing to the person.

Instead, MobileEars hopes to solve the problem in a cheap, accessible, and subtle fashion. Their app uses the microphone on a user’s smartphone to amplify sounds around them, and feed them back through headphones. The kicker here though is that it isn’t just an amplifier. It uses a form of speech recognition technology to pick up and amplify voices, whether a person speaking in front of you or on TV, and dim out the ambient noise.

MobileEye has also made provisions for variations in user’s extent of hearing loss, based on statistics of the condition. When you start up the app, it collects a few details like your age and gender to optimise the experience, but you can always fine tune it later.

Right now, the app needs a user to have their headphones connected, though the next logical step is improving the hardware, Bhatt says. The idea is to one day replace hearing aids entirely, though that may be a ways off.

For the time being, MobileEars is happy to just be a cheap alternative to expensive medical aids. And by cheap we mean the app is free to use on iOS, with an Android version likely incoming in the near future. It even works offline so you don’t have to worry about your data where your well-being is concerned.

And the company supposedly doesn’t have any revenue plans in the near future. If that does eventually happen, Bhatt believes it’ll either be by adding extra features to a premium version of the app, or by manufacturing companion hardware. “Right now, the focus is on getting the word out,” he says."

Are we judging a Subway sandwich boy by his ability to cook a biryani?,"Test cricket is in contraction mode, has been for some time while the romantics looked the other way but we continue to use those metrics to judge the health of a nation's cricket. © Getty

Nineteen Windies wickets fell in a day of Test cricket in England recently. Sadder than the fact that it actually happened, was the fact that it didn't surprise a lot of people too much. We didn't rub our eyes in disbelief and even the narrative on whether a once great singer was singing terribly off-key is now an old one. As the emotional voice of West Indies cricket, Fazeer Mohammad, keeps telling us, this fall started a long time ago.

I have recently spent a lot of time in Sri Lanka, a place whose cricketers I have admired greatly for their skill and their modesty. Over three Test matches they were competitive for about three quarters of a day and some might say, that shouldn't have surprised me either. Maybe it just saddened me and expressing surprise was a means of lessening the impact.

Since the events have occurred simultaneously, they are a cue for a discussion on the state of test cricket. In England, where more is written about cricket than anywhere else (in India, we speak more about it, often in loud voices when the team loses; for eg. in a World Cup semifinal), there is even greater concern for Test cricket. It is understandable and yet futile. Understandable, because Test cricket still has strong roots in England; and futile, because they might be clamouring for a past that is never to return.

The grim pronouncements surrounding Windies and Sri Lanka leave me wondering if we are using the wrong metrics to judge teams now. It wasn't that long ago that Sri Lanka had mounted an outstanding run chase against India at the Champions Trophy. And the Windies are the only team to have won the World T20 twice. In Andre Russell, Dwayne Bravo and Sunil Narine, they have among the three most wanted players in T20 cricket and it wasn't that long ago that Chris Gayle was the reigning superstar of the format. Towards the end of India's short tour of the Caribbean in June and July, I saw the West Indies take apart a pretty strong Indian team in a T20 international.

The time has come then, some might say with justification that it came long ago, to ask ourselves whether the metrics we use to judge players and teams are still valid. Sanjay Manjrekar bemoans, and rightly so, the first class averages of those playing Test cricket now but maybe in the format they are more suited to play, Test and first-class records aren't the right indicators anymore. Players like Sunil Narine, and Lendl Simmons is actually a better example, have first-class records that you wouldn't glance at a second time but at what they are currently doing, they are invaluable. Dickwella and Gunathillake wouldn't have you up in worry the night before a game but they can trouble you over an hour's play.

Test cricket is in contraction mode, has been for some time while the romantics looked the other way (and, dare I say, shot furtive glances occasionally), but we continue to use those metrics to judge the health of a nation's cricket. Maybe cricket is running the 100 metre dash and we are judging the athletes for their endurance over 5000 metres. We don't ask Usain Bolt if he can run like Mo Farah but we want the Windies, the world champions over T20 cricket, to hang in there and fight grittily till the last man at a game that is ten times longer.

Many years ago, I had suggested that we accept that a slow cooked Hyderabadi biryani will have to live alongside a Subway sandwich. Indeed, we have accepted that but I fear we send the kid at the Subway counter to cook biryanis and bemoan his lack of skill. He might well turn around and say, as many in the Caribbean already are, that the queues outside his shop are longer.

"India@70: Reshaping diets, speeches and even our thoughts","Let’s start with what happened at a madrassa on Independence Day this year. Little boys and girls, neatly dressed and holding paper flags, were seated on a dhurrie, when a reporter strolled in. Mistaking the journalist for a government officer, sent to ‘check’ and report to headquarters, the madrassa teacher hastily assured the hack everything was on track. “The children have just finished singing the national anthem…but they will sing it again for you if you want, sir.” What a telling moment! Doesn’t that innocent reaction say everything? To me, this incident was far more revealing of the sentiments across the country than the superb interview of Hamid Ansari, and the censored television address of Tripura CM Manik Sarkar. Taken as a whole, these unconnected but significant incidents point to just one thing: Paranoia, and a lack of trust. As Hamid Ansari stated, “Overall, the very fact that the Indianness of any citizen is being questioned is a disturbing thought.”

Narendra Modi may have been extra considerate this year, when he made the shortest (56 minutes) Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. As expected, it was peppered with the usual alliterations, and word play with the rather trite ‘golis’ and ‘gaalis’ reference. There was little by way of content to reassure citizens when exactly the elusive ‘acche din’ will finally arrive — if they exist at all. Just a few days earlier, Hamid Ansari had spoken up boldly during an impassioned parting interview, in which he’d gone ahead and addressed the herd of elephants in India’s room. There was shock, awe and admiration when he candidly talked about the “sense of unease among Muslims”, and referred to “a sense of insecurity creeping in”. Was he lying? Exaggerating? Over-dramatising? Of course not! He had hit the bull’s eye. If the underlying truth in what he said didn’t make us flinch, it should have. The Prime Minister had two choices once Ansari’s interview gained momentum: A) He could have ignored Ansari. B) Or, Modi could have equally boldly stated it was time to address these prickly issues head on, since they perturb over 184 million Muslim citizens of India. He did neither. Instead, he picked a third, and very shabby option: he not only mocked the erudite gentleman who had been India’s respected Vice President for two terms (2007-2017) by saying that he had shown his true colours (read: Muslim identity) and advised him to “follow your basic ideology and instinct.” If this is not provocative and divisive, what is? To make it worse, the BJP dubbed Ansari a “mannerless” man.

Chief Minister Manik Sarkar publicly stated his position (outrage!) after being asked to ‘reshape’ his Independence Day speech. That word ‘reshape’ is dangerous and loaded. Today, an elected chief minister of an important, sensitive state is being asked to ‘reshape’ a pre-recorded speech which was found unacceptable by Big Brother (Prasar Bharati). What chance do ordinary citizens have? We will soon be ordered — perhaps at gunpoint — to ‘reshape’ our words, thoughts, even emotions. Our diets have already been ‘reshaped’. This is perhaps the first time in 70 years that a chief minister’s speech has been targeted. Surely, citizens have the right to hear it, regardless of what the Centre feels? Hamid Ansari raised the very pertinent Muslim issue of identity and belonging in today’s India, while Manik Sarkar pointed out that Dalits and minorities are under attack. Are they making it up?

These are but two intelligent, educated, aware men daring to voice what countless citizens fear. Ansari has already withdrawn into a neutral zone after the Prime Minister’s below-the-belt tongue lashing. Let’s see what happens to Manik Sarkar, who has openly accused the Central Government of censorship. When asked what action he planned to take, he answered soberly and thoughtfully, “I have brought this to the notice of the common people of our country. They are the best ones to judge what is going on.”

The problem in placing so much trust in the common people is this: when the Centre controls virtually every bit of what is available for public consumption, the narrative becomes not just one-dimensional and one-sided, but also gets twisted beyond recognition. Who the hell knows what’s going on in India? Not me. Not the average citizen. And that is far scarier than the prospect of a ‘small war’ with China. I am waiting for some brilliant Niti Aayog spokesperson to reshape, recycle and represent our immediate future. The past has been taken care of, thank you."
Donald Trump’s realism and implications for India,"By: Sanjay Pulipaka

The United States President Donald Trump, on Monday,delivered a nuanced speech outlining the new Afghanistan strategy. He did not deviate from the prepared text, and the speech received considerable appreciation from within and outside the United States. While President Trump’s speech focused mostly on the United States (US) policy towards Afghanistan, it also briefly reflected on the domestic politics as well.

After 17 years of military engagement, fatigue has come to characterise the US policy towards Afghanistan. The necessity of the withdrawal defines the public discourse on Afghanistan in the United States. Contrary to his initial impulse, President Trump has stated that victory in Afghanistan is possible and constitutes an “outcome worthy of tremendous sacrifices that have been made.” He also alluded to the possibility that a rapid withdrawal may create a vacuum which will be filled only by the ISIS and Al Qaeda.

In 2009, former President Obama announced deployment 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan and simultaneously enunciated a timetable for the withdrawal commencing from the middle of 2011. This surge-and-withdrawal approach did not yield results,as the Taliban instead of launching offensives merely waited for the draw-down of American forces. Contrary to Obama’s approach, President Trump’s Afghan strategy refrained from clearly specifying the troop levels or defining the timetable. Instead, he stated that the US military posture in Afghanistan will evolve constantly based on ground conditions and the commanders would have greater freedom in terms of deploying various resources.

It appears that the current senior White House staffs, who were involved in the drafting the new strategy, are serious students of noted realist thinker Hans J Morgenthau. The resonance of Morgenthau views was evident when President Trump stated:“we must address the reality of the world as it exists right now.” By repeatedly asserting that the US should be guided by ‘security interests’ and not normative concerns, President Trump declared his preference for a realist framework over a liberal approach. This implies that agenda such as the promotion of democracy and protection of human rights will take a back seat. While the focus on “killing terrorists” is an important objective, Trump’s Afghan strategy seems to be neglecting the need to recognise and contest the political structures and ideological processes that are creating and validating terrorism.

President Trump was sharply critical of Pakistan’s tactic of taking assistance from the US to fight terrorism and providing a haven for terror groups such as the Taliban. While President Trump has called on Pakistan to demonstrate its genuine commitment to combat terrorism, one wonders as to how the US will respond if Pakistan fails to comply. With significant improvement in the bilateral relationship with China, Pakistan will demonstrate considerable reluctance to change the course.Not surprisingly, in less than 24 hours, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson came out in support of Pakistan and pointed out that sacrifices made by Pakistan in fighting terrorism should be recognized.

India will feel vindicated that Pakistan has been recognised for its duplicity in promoting terrorism and simultaneously claimingto be its victim. However, there will be concerns in India on equating the rest of South Asia with developments in the Af-Pak region. Terrorism emanating from the Af-Pak region has its own dynamic, and there is no need to expand the definition of the problem area to the rest of South Asia.

President Trump referred to India’s tireless efforts in Afghanistan and called on India to play a more proactive role in Afghanistan. However, he went on to add that “India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan.” This is the second time that President Trump has deployed the phrase ‘billions of dollars’ referring to India, which conveys an impression of disproportionate and an unfair gain. Earlier, he used a similar phrase while announcing the US withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.

India will also have to carefully examine if Trump is deploying a ‘good terrorist’ and a ‘bad terrorist’ distinction. President Trump stated his objectives are obliterating the ISIS and crushing Al Qaeda. However, concerning Taliban, his goal is to prevent it from taking over Afghanistan. Further, he added that it is “possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban” in Afghanistan. Terrorism is a consequence of regressive social and political ideas propounded by groups such as Taliban. Therefore, incorporating elements of Taliban in the Afghan government and its implications for regional security needs to be mapped out.

Friends, such as India, and allies would have taken note that President Trump started his major foreign policy speech by referring to domestic politics in the US. He reiterated the necessity of transcending race, ethnicity, creed and colour to build a unified country. In a telling statement, he noted: “The young men and women we send to fight our wars abroad deserve to return to a country that is not at war with itself at home.” It is clear that President Trump was responding to the events in Charlottesville and his statements, which elicited a sharp response from across the political spectrum in the US. While analysts will dissect the metaphor of “war” to describe domestic politics, it should be noted that President Trump seems to have made an honest admission of the deep political divide that America needs to transcend. Friends and foes of the US will assess as to whether the current US administration has theenergy to respond to an intense domestic crisis and also pursue robust external posture. Further, the sustainability of the new Afghan strategy, based on principles of realism, will also be contingent on stemming the high attrition rate in the White House.

5 places in the house for a perfect quickie,"Having sex need not be a nocturnal affair every time, and neither does it need to have a fixed time.

We give you five really cool yet off-beat nooks in the house for a quick sex sesh:

On the rug

Against the cupboard

And you thought it was only for storing your clothes? Cupboards make for the perfect backdrop for the irresistible, gotta-do-it-now kind of sex. And guess what! A cupboard with a mirror is an add-on, as the two of you get to watch each other in the act, thus turning up the kink level.

Rocking chair

"As NASA's Mission Voyager-2 Enters Its 40th Year, Indian Classical Music Still Resonates In Space","Forty years on and 11 billion miles from earth in the huge vastness of space there is the sound of India. And how did this happen? As Nasa's ground-breaking Voyager-2 mission enters its 40th year this month, not many are aware that the spacecraft is carrying a golden record with different sounds of earth and international music and one of them are from India.

AFP/Representational Image

Voyager-2 was launched on August 20, 1977, and is the first spacecraft to have flown by all the four outer planets--Saturn, Uranus, Jupiter and Neptune. The music of India is a Hindustani classical composition called ""Jaat Kahan Ho"", rendered by Surshri Kesarbai Kerkar, a noted khayal singer of the second half of the 20th century.

The recording, which lasts for three minutes and 25 seconds, forms part of the 12-inch gold-plated copper disc carried by Voyager-2. Its twin, Voyager-1, launched on September 5, 1977, also carries a similar disc.

Reuters

The Indian music was chosen by a Nasa-appointed committee chaired by Carl Sagan. In the book ""Murmurs Of Earth - The Voyager Interstellar Record"", published in 1978, Ann Druyan, Sagan's wife, recalls that Robert Brown, then executive director for the Centre For World Music in Berkeley placed ""Jaat Kahan Ho"" at the top of his list of world music for outer space.

After a great deal of effort, Druyan finally located the record at a shop in New York.

Brown has stated: ""If I could extend the list, it would include the following: a lively mridangam solo from India in a tala of five beats played by Palghat Mani Iyer who may well be the world's best drummer ...""

AFP

Timothy Ferris, who served as a producer of the Voyager Golden Record, says Kesarbai, who was born in 1893 in Goa, was awarded the title of 'Surshri' in 1938 by Rabindranath Tagore on behalf of the residents of Kolkata.

""One of my favourite transitions on the Voyager record comes when 'Flowing Stream' ends and we are transported, quick as a curtsy, across the Himalayas to the north of India and from the sound of one musical genius, Kuan Ping-hu to another, Surshri Kesarbai Kerkar,"" Ferris says. ""The raga heard on Voyager is formally designated for morning performance, but its popularity has led to its use as a closing number, a kind of encore, for concerts day and night.""

He writes that Kesarbai made this recording when she was past 70. Apart from the music, the record also carries a message in Hindi which when translated means: ""We are citizens of earth: We are greeting you."" The other Indian languages represented in the record are Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Oriya, Telugu and Urdu.

"Founders keepers? Infosys badly hit by internal turbulence, must find a way out in tough environment","The irony of Vishal Sikka’s departure from Infosys is hard to miss. Sikka bravely led the Indian IT industry charge against unpredictable global headwinds in the form of protectionism and disruptive technological changes. But internal turbulence within Infosys proved too difficult to negotiate. When NR Narayana Murthy and the other founder-promoters exited Infosys’s board in 2014, it was hailed as a talismanic moment for corporate governance. After all, it’s not often that Indian promoters turn over their companies to professional managers. Having decided to let go, Murthy should have resisted the temptation to interfere.

Ultimately, Infosys’s stock and Murthy’s reputation took a beating. Sikka was brought in after slowing revenue growth from outsourcing, high attrition rate, and top-level exits dimmed the aura that Murthy and co-promoters assiduously built up over two decades. If the Murthy era focussed on paring down costs to maximise labour arbitrage, Sikka loosened purse strings and utilised cash reserves to fund overseas acquisitions and offer very generous salary and severance packages. Murthy took offence to these changes in corporate culture forcing the Infosys board to play a delicate balancing act between shareholders and its chief executive.

But that restraint ended with the board’s statement accusing Murthy of a “misguided campaign”. After such acrimony Infosys may not attract a top-notch technology leader from outside. Sikka placed his bets on artificial intelligence, automation and cloud computation to improve productivity and sustain Infosys’s edge. This strategy demands a CEO focussed on technology and innovation. The Elon Musks come at a high premium but offer the hope of creating new business and employment opportunities to offset the job losses from AI and automation. Murthy must take a page out of Bill Gates’s playbook. He must allow Infosys to reinvent itself in a changing business and technology environment."
Indians Always Need A Quick Solution For Acidity! This Cool Creative Augmented Reality Show Totally Combats It,"PARTNER

Ever had that weird heartburn which almost scared you into thinking it’s a heart attack or that gassy feeling in the stomach that keeps moving to every part of the body? If there’s one common irritating problem which we Indians face too often, it’s Acidity! Acidity has literally become a lifestyle issue because we are always busy trying to manage our daily routine in the quickest and easiest way possible. We tend to eat late, take too much stress, consume excessive caffeine or alcohol, consume fast-food (read: extra spicy food) and so on. And all this ends up causing that excess secretion of acids in the gastric glands of the stomach. When the secretion is more than usual, we feel, what is commonly known as heartburn (which is normally triggered by consumption of spicy foods, and other lifestyle factors we spoke about).

To combat the evil of heartburn, Eno India came up with Eno Cooling which provides fast relief from acidity with a unique sensation. But the most interesting part was how they introduced Eno Cooling to India. To depict fighting acidity real-time, they used a Cool Augmented Reality Experience across Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai in various malls. The chilly monsters were literally combated by Eno Cooling in an epic battle wherein the participants had to play it LIVE! This innovative AR activity garnered a tremendous response across India. Super-cool isn’t it? Watch the video to virtually experience this cool augmented reality battle with the chilly monsters!"

Govt is bad at running hospitals. Let’s have Modicare instead,"In one of the most macabre and tragic incidents in recent times, 70 children died in BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur in the span of two days. The supplier allegedly cut supply of liquid oxygen after multiple unpaid bills. Many other theories are floating around too. Blame is being ascribed to the government, hospital authorities, the supplier, and some are even saying this isn’t about the oxygen shortage at all. Essentially, everyone involved has found someone to blame.

The children, however, are dead. Their families will have to live with this irreparable loss and immeasurable sorrow all their lives. Making things worse is the knowledge that this was avoidable. This happened because of one reason — utter mismanagement, a hallmark of government-run services in India.

Those who remember the pre-cellphone era days will recall the harrowing experience in obtaining a landline connection. Government-run hotels and airlines are usually of far poorer quality than their private counterparts.

When it comes to the Indian government, one thing is clear — it just can’t do complex services well. When the operations require constant interaction with lots of customers, quick decision-making and a certain amount of quality control, the government is simply terrible at running it.

Of course, mismanagement at MTNL meant you wouldn’t have a phone, and at Air India would mean your flight would be delayed. When things are bungled up in a hospital, you can die, en masse in this case.

The purpose of this article is not government bashing, something enough pieces have done. It is to make the government understand and accept its limitation — it just can’t do complex services well. The reason is simple. Most government staff adopt a ‘cover-their-backside’ approach to work. For government employees, there is no upside for initiative, creativity or improving things. In fact, if their ideas go wrong, they will suffer for it. Hence, the typical babu’s approach is this — do nothing new. Repeat, until retired.

This is why nobody acted on something as basic as oxygen in Gorakhpur. Ideally, the oxygen supplier should be on autopay. The hospital should also have an oxygen inventory system. Any meaningful drops should trigger an order, with automatic payments. Every hospital should have a line of credit for pre-approved emergency items. These are fairly obvious, implementable things. However, who will do this? Anybody suggesting so won’t get a raise, or a promotion or even recognition. However, if for some reason there are hiccups, the person will be blamed and punished (by perhaps a bad transfer or a stalling of his promotion). Hence, do nothing.

The bigger solution is to change this management style — across every government entity. Our government officials need to be empowered or incentivised to improve things.

The government can also take note of its limitations. While it doesn’t do complex services well, it does run fairly decent financial institutions. Money is a simpler product to handle (than, say, liquid oxygen and life-saving medicines) and routine systems are enough to keep things going. LIC is one of India’s top insurers. A better direction for the government would be to improve India’s medical insurance, and be less involved in running hospitals. Do note that some of India’s best doctors are in government hospitals. Talent does get attracted to government jobs and they can stay. However, it is the running of the hospitals —cleanliness, supplies, logistics and payments where the government falters. Get out of that. Insure more people. Give them a good coverage plan. Keep good doctors. And let more private players run the hospitals.

Some efforts like the Rural Health Insurance Scheme have been modestly successful, but have not transformed the medical sector. The insurance coverage given under such schemes is paltry. A new comprehensive medical insurance scheme (and it doesn’t have to be free) that offers Indian’s good medical coverage across the private and public health network may work better than the government running thousands of large hospitals. If there can be Obamacare, why not Modicare?

One also needs to relieve the excess pressure on the public health system. While some fault lies with poor management, some of what happened is due to overstretched healthcare facilities. Whether through insurance or new hospitals, we do need to spend more on healthcare (as a percentage of GDP).

Nothing can lessen the pain of the people who lost their kids. What we can hope is to learn lessons from this horrible incident and reform our healthcare system so Gorakhpur never, ever happens again."
Return To Summit: Rafael Nadal claws his way back to No.1,"In what can only be described as a Herculean effort, Spanish tennis ace Rafael Nadal has returned to the World No.1 ranking beginning his fourth stint at the pinnacle of the men’s game. Rafa’s return to the top nine years after he first made it there is also unprecedented. This after he had to cut short his season last year due to a wrist injury. Plus, before he started his 2017 season, there were doubts about his return to top form. Some so-called experts speculated that Rafa’s battered and bruised body – thanks to his aggressive style of play – was finally giving up on him. They even opined that the game had gone beyond him with a new crop of exciting players such as Dominic Thiem, Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic finally making their mark.

How wrong were they! After incorporating Carlos Moya into his coaching team, Rafa roared into the 2017 season. Not only did he reach the final of the Australian Open – going down to his great rival Roger Federer in another riveting encounter – but he also tore up the clay court season – as Federer had predicted – completing an unprecedented decima (10 titles) each at the Roland Garros, Monte Carlo Masters and the Barcelona Open.

At 31, few will argue that Rafa hasn’t achieved enough. With 15 Grand Slam titles under his belt, Rafa has already etched his name into the annals of tennis history. True, he might no longer be the indomitable force he was in 2008 or 2010. But what Rafa has shown – and younger tennis players need to learn – in the last few years is his incredible ability to adapt his game to what his body can deliver. In this context, Rafa has made his game sharper, taking more risks and chasing down fewer balls on the defence. He has continuously worked on his serve, getting it to eke out that little extra.

Making such adjustments requires a player to constantly assess both his abilities as well as those of his opponents. And it is this desire to improve continuously that sets Rafa apart from the rest. In fact, Rafa today regains the No.1 spot not because he is head and shoulders above the other players on court. He is back at the summit because he is a tireless worker who is unfazed by the injuries and challenges that come his way. In that sense, this ascent of Rafa’s is typical of those matches where he slowly grinds his opponents to dust. Rafa is a warrior who never gives up. He finds a way to win even when the chips are down. And he can be No.1 even when he is not playing in God mode. That’s what is really scary for Rafa’s opponents. May Rafa continue to enthral us for years to come. Vamos Rafa!"
The Congress’s idea of India exposed,"Ashish Kulkarni, an aide to Rahul Gandhi and one of his election managers resigned recently. In his resignation letter, he cited the reasons: The Congress party was seen to be siding with the separatists in Jammu and Kashmir; the party was veering to the far left; it was also perceived to be anti-Hindu; the party catered to outright nepotism and was seen as elitist; finally, there was too much minority appeasement.

In a few short perceptive statements he managed to grasp what Lutyen’s Delhi has not been able to and why Digvijay Singh, Mani Shankar Aiyar and others of the Congress old guard are completely out of touch with India. It is not about nationalism or being Hindu, it is as Jay Panda, very rightfully pointed out at a roundtable discussion, that for decades India has not been governed according to our Constitution.

Every Indian under the constitution is considered equal. There must be a Uniform Civil Code for all Indians. These two mandated guarantees were largely ignored for vote banks and today, Indians are questioning it. That is why Triple Talaq, Love Jihad, Haj subsidies and other such issues are coming out in the open now. Muslim women themselves are demanding that the question of divorce cannot be left to arbitrary Mullahs, where men are allowed to abandon their wives at will. Why should a secular Republic be dictated by rules that are not only archaic but a form of appeasement to minorities?

India at 70 has to move on and by moving on we not only need to give opportunities to each and every young person but we also need to recognize the rights of women under a universal law.

For too long India has been living under the guise of a repressive tolerance. Left leaning socialism with its License Raj where companies could only produce so many cars or so many tons of steel led to massive corruption, high prices and a closed economy. It is a shame that we let go our basic manufacturing industries of electronics to China and helped them become a super power while our population remained poor, jobless and hungry.

It is horrendous that we let the separatists in Kashmir dictate to us how much money they wanted for peace in the valley all the while taking money from Pakistan for disturbing the peace. For decades, the central government was actually conniving, condoning and paying for terror in the valley along with, it seems, Pakistan! For years our police force and army sacrificed their lives for keeping the peace, while the local politicians in Kashmir and Hurriyat leaders were paid off to keep the valley simmering and the youth inflamed.

Recently, Zaroor Ahmed Watali a billionaire businessman, and close aide to Geelani, was found with secret diaries that revealed his ties with Pakistan’s ISI and funding to terrorists. The fact that since 1990 he has been using his businesses as a front for managing funds for the separatists for financing subversive activities in the valley and was arrested in 1990 and imprisoned but then let go, speaks volumes about politicians in Kashmir who grew rich on the blood of its people.

For 27 years Watali was allowed to finance terror in the valley and his businesses flourished in UAE , Europe, Mumbai and Kashmir thanks to political patronage and terror financing. The National Investigative Agency (NAI) is finally closing in on the separatists but we need to go after the politicians who allowed this kind of treason to flourish.

Ashish Kulkarni, has done us a big favour by pointing out that the Congress extended too many favours to the separatists. It is time we found out why?"

"New Afghan Strategy: For it to work, Trump must recalibrate approach to Iran","US President Donald Trump has finally articulated his new Afghanistan strategy that reverses the Obama administration’s focus on withdrawal of American troops. Instead, the new plan seeks to increase troop deployment up to 4,000 additional soldiers who will now work closely with Afghan security forces on the ground. The thinking in Washington today is that Obama’s focus on wrapping up operations in Afghanistan during the final years of his tenure emboldened the Taliban who have slowly clawed back the advantage. Therefore, if the Americans completely pack up now it will be tantamount to handing over Afghanistan to the Taliban.

This assessment is not without merit. The Taliban have proved to be a hardy lot. Plus, there is now a consensus that peace without any participation of the Taliban is impossible. Whether one likes it or not, the Taliban do represent a significant section of the Afghan population. Add to this the fact that the Pashtun group has been cleverly positioning itself as the only force capable of fighting the growing presence of the Islamic State in Afghanistan. Taken together, the Taliban has to be part of the political solution in Afghanistan.

So the question now is: How much space should the Taliban be given in future peace negotiations? Ideally, the US would want to negotiate from a position of strength and create a situation where the Taliban is one of many balancing forces in Afghanistan. This means denying the Taliban an overwhelming role in the future Afghan state structure. And that would require militarily beating the Taliban into an acceptable shape. Hence the focus of the new strategy on boosting American troops.

That said, the part of the equation that the US really needs to solve is Pakistan. There’s no denying the fact that Pakistan has a vested interest in supporting and sustaining the Taliban for strategic depth in Afghanistan. It has been doing this all this while, proffering a dubious ‘Good Taliban, Bad Taliban’ line to keep its own strategic assets intact. Washington’s failure has been its inability to see through Islamabad’s duplicity. While Trump has called out Pakistan for sheltering terrorists and asserted that things can’t remain the same, there’s no clarity on the way forward. Given Afghanistan’s geopolitical reality, Pakistan has a natural influence on Afghanistan. But if this has become a problem for the US, then Washington must look for another country to help actualise Afghan stability.

It’s welcome that Trump has recognised India’s role in security and development of Afghanistan. New Delhi has already done a lot in terms of infrastructure building in that country, as exemplified by the construction of the new Afghan Parliament. Of course, it can do much more. However, given its geographical proximity, Iran too is crucial for ensuring stability in Afghanistan. This is where Trump is missing a trick. If he is serious about putting Pakistan under the cosh, for the sake of Afghanistan he must recalibrate his approach to Iran.

Treating Iran as the enemy, threatening to rescind the Iran nuclear deal, and giving into Saudi insecurities won’t help the US with Afghanistan. If Washington is truly thinking of bypassing Islamabad, it must establish a credible working relationship with Tehran. The latter has enough stakes in the Afghan situation to help the Americans create the right balance between Pashtun and non-Pashtun groups. This approach will dilute Pakistan’s influence on Afghan polity, check the Taliban’s power, and allow countries like India to do more in Afghanistan. Besides, Iran today has a moderate President who is seeking to open up his country and modernise its economy. This is the worst time for Washington to adopt an adversarial position with respect to Tehran. Trump should not allow his foreign policy to be guided by Saudi paranoia."
Merger drama and fragile Tamil dreams,"Two factions of Tamil Nadu’s AIADMK party have come together, attempting to fill a J Jayalalithaa-size hole after her death earlier this year. E K Palaniswami of AIADMK (Amma), the standby incumbent, will continue as chief minister. His rival O Panneerselvam will be accommodated as deputy chief minister. It is common knowledge that the reconciliation was brokered by the BJP, in power at the Centre. The BJP believes that its role as dealmaker between the two factions of AIADMK and support to keep it in power in Chennai, will allow it to get a toehold in the southern state.

Elections for the assembly are due only in 2021. But Lok Sabha polls are due in two years, and Tamil Nadu’s 40 seats, 39 of them now held by the AIADMK, are crucial for the BJP. Its managers like Amit Shah know that an alliance with the AIADMK might enable the party to make inroads into India’s vast southern peninsula. Yet, there are two reasons why the gamble might fail to yield results. One, a third, disgruntled AIADMK faction, led by TTV Dhinakaran, nephew of Jayalalithaa’s aide Sasikala, claims the support of 20 elected lawmakers. Sasikala is behind bars on a case related to disproportionate assets. If Dhinakaran withdraws his lawmakers and sides with the main opposition party DMK, the incumbent government could fall.

Two, even if this does not happen, the BJP is firmly identified as a north-Indian outfit by Tamil voters. For decades now, the latter have consistently voted for Dravidian parties, relegating even the once-powerful Congress to the margins of electoral politics. The BJP cannot be faulted for its attempts to break new ground. But the tremendous uncertainty that has gripped Tamil and AIADMK politics casts a long shadow over administrative stability and governance."

Who divided India? Jinnah or Nehru?,"What led to India’s Partition? Could it have been avoided? If not Partition, the bloodbath that claimed the lives of more than 1 million people?

In a brilliant, must-read effort, noted military historian Barney White-Spunner recounts what happened in 1947, freedom and its aftermath, in 12 riveting chapters, each earmarked for a month from January, in Partition: The Story of Indian Independence And The Creation of Pakistan in 1947 (Published by Simon and Schuster, Pages 419, Price Rs 699).

How much of Mahatma Gandhi’s famed non-violence was a sham or an ineffective ploy could be understood from reading this brutally honest account of Partition. The killings had begun much earlier than August 15, 1947.

It is important to give the background of the author. White-Spunner has commanded British and allied troops at every level from troop to field army, including the elite 16 Air Assault Brigade, whom he took into Kabul in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. He has also led operations in the Balkans and Iraq, as well as Africa and Asia. The robustness of his prose in Partition—clear, sympathetic but unsentimental—is a testament to his qualities as a fighter. He enters where it matters, the end of the Raj.



White-Spunner picks up his pieces from the time Field Marshal Lord Archibald Wavell, Viceroy of India, gets his marching orders from the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee on January 31, 1947. On February 20, Attlee made a statement to the House of Commons announcing that Britain would leave India by a date not later than June 1948. He also announced that Earl Mountbatten would take over from Wavell as viceroy.

White-Spunner offers us a soldier’s perspective. He says it is important to accept that events of August to November 1947 were a terrible tragedy, not just in bloodshed and human misery but in their consequences. Were they avoidable and who was responsible for them?

He says Britain should have handed over power to Indians in 1919 after the end of the first World War as recognition of India’s extraordinary generous contribution to the British war effort, both in the number of men who volunteered and in money. The call for Pakistan had not become shrill or sharper at that time. But White-Spunner points out that Britain’s refusal to leave while not having the resources nor the real willingness to administer and develop India in the way the country so badly needed, was the main cause of the tragedy in 1947. He also says the year 1935 presented another opportunity when the government of India Act offered the logical moment to grant Dominion status but again it was missed. “By 1947 there was little of the Raj still functioning apart from the army. India was disintegrating.”

Many have said, including Pakistani historian Ayesha Jalal, that it was Congress’s hunger for power that led to the Partition. But White-Spunner makes the picture clearer when he writes that Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had their own reasons for rebuffing Muhammad Ali Jinnah. “Had Congress reacted more favourably to Jinnah’s approaches in 1937, then things might have turned out differently but their (Nehru and Patel) experience in the Interim Government had shown them that they were better without the League. For Congress, it was essential to maintain that strong central government without which they feared they could not keep the country together. For Jinnah, whose vision was a federal India with the League sharing power and exercising control over the Muslim majority provinces on the original Palestine model, this was a bitter blow. He never got what he wanted.”

White-Spunner has relied on many sources—books, interviews, newspapers—to write his account of Partition but chief among them is The Transfer of Power papers, a massive twelve-volume compendium of all official correspondence relating to Indian Independence and Partition between 1942-47. Published by the British government between 1970 and 1983, it is a godsend for a historian, gathering as it does all the government documents in one well-edited series. There is no doubt that the strength of White-Spunner’s account is ToP papers.

So instead of blaming Jinnah for the Partition, he says it was Nehru and Patel who decided to get on with it quickly. It may be stunning to know that Nehru, with Mahatma Gandhi’s support, even tried in May to get the British to hand over in June. Congress was impatient for power.

But it was not the rush for power that caused the slaughter but the inability by all the key players to foresee it. Nehru did not believe religion held such sway in India. Jinnah did not understand Punjab. Mountbatten hardly knew India.

White-Spunner says that the only way to prevent the slaughter was to police the Punjab properly. He significantly points out that there is no excuse for not using British and Gurkha troops and deploying alongside them those non-communal units of Indian troops who would not be affected by local affiliations.

Mountbatten was against it. White-Spunner argues that there was ample time to brief and deploy the army, with the accompanying air power in July. He notes that while Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims slaughtered each other in August 1947, over half a million servicemen stood idle.

But there are other views as well. A K Damodaran, the Congress activist and a future Indian diplomat, differed with the view that Mountbatten rushed it. In 1988 he told the BBC that “despite the Calcutta killings, the cosy Delhi elite had an overromantic view of the Punjab. They never expected what happened. We took a very purist Hindu logical view of partition. In retrospect we were being too clever by half.”

So while India had its heroes during its struggle for Independence and during its hour of freedom, it had none during the terrible days of Partition. A tragedy, indeed."
SC issues show cause notice to BCCI top brass,"BCCI VS LODHA REFORMS

SC issues show cause notice to BCCI top brass

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 23 Aug, 2017, 08:53 PM

The Supreme Court, on Wednesday (August 23), issued a show cause notice to the top brass of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, namely acting President CK Khanna, secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry, asking them to personally appear on September 19 (next date of hearing) and offer their explanation to the Committee of Administrators (CoA) for the continued resistance towards the implementation of the Justice RM Lodha panel reforms.

While the CoA reiterated to the apex court that not a single recommendation had been implemented till date, the Supreme Court asked the CoA to prepare the draft constitution in line with the July 24, 2017 order.

However, the apex court didn't heed to the request made by the CoA in its fifth status report regarding their expulsion.

The hearing on the latest status report submitted by the CoA on BCCI's functioning was originally meant to take place last week, before it was adjourned to Wednesday (August 23).

Earlier, in its fifth status report submitted to the Supreme Court, the Vinod Rai-led Committee of Administrators was scathing in its criticism of the BCCI. The CoA had called for the expulsion of the current office bearers of the board for non-compliance of the court's orders to implement the Lodha reforms. Taking into account the court's order dated January 2, that ousted Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke from their positions with the board, the CoA requested the three-member bench for the removal of acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary, treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry and acting president CK Khanna.

The CoA had also noted that in the absence of a working committee, administrators, and not the office-bearers needed to be given the authority to manage the board's affairs. The CoA had also added that the office bearers were limiting the role of the board CEO Rahul Johri.

Incidentally, during the Special General Meeting (SGM) held on July 26 this year, Johri wasn't allowed to partake in the meeting under intriguing circumstances. Choudhary had then observed that the Apex Court in its judgment dated July 24 had ruled only office-bearers with regard to state associations eligible to attend the SGM. Therefore, the board claimed to have been following the order of the Supreme Court ""in letter and spirit"".

The ruling that was taken into account to deny Johri's participation in the meeting was related to CoA's objection about N Srinivasan and Niranjan Shah attending BCCI's meetings. The apex court had stated on July 24 that only the office bearers of the state associations can attend BCCI's meetings.

CoA had also stated in its report that the board was impeding the implementation of the 'new administrative structure' which is based on accountability and clarity. The Supreme Court, on their part, had asked the BCCI to identify those ""exceptional and extremely limited areas of difficulty"" in relation to implementation of the Lodha reforms.

At its Special General Meeting held on July 26, the BCCI had then said the following needed to be re-examined: one state-one vote policy, the number of members in selection committees (which had been reduced to three from five), the concept of associate membership, the segregation in relation to functions executed by office bearers and paid professionals, disqualifications or restrictions on office-bearers in terms of age cap, tenure, cooling-off period and the formation of Apex Council.

The three-member SC bench comprising Justices Deepak Misra, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud had given its nod to reconsider some of the Lodha recommendations which it previously accepted, like the one-state-one-vote, strength of the selection committee and the concept of associate membership.

In its Status report, the CoA, however, had quoted Rai and said, ""the heart, kidney and lungs are being taken out of these reforms"" in relation to the board observing that the crux of the reforms approved by the Supreme Court was ""impracticable.""

Last year, in a landmark judgment on July 18, 2016, the Supreme Court had approved majority of the recommendations put forth by the three committee, led by retired Chief Justice RM Lodha. The board, on the other hand, was given a deadline of six months to implement the accepted reforms.

Neymar Lands In Trouble As Barcelona Demand 8.5 Million Euros From Him Over Contract Breach,"Barcelona are seeking at least 8.5 million euros ($10 million) from Neymar for breach of contract, the club said as the bitter fallout rumbles on from his world record 222-million-euro move to Paris Saint-Germain.

afp

""In this lawsuit, the club demands the amount already paid as a bonus for the renewal of his contract for breach of contract, 8.5 million euros in damages, and an additional 10 percent in interests,"" Barcelona said in a statement.

afp

Neymar signed a new five-year deal with Barca in 2016, but the Catalans were powerless to stop his move to PSG just a year later as the French side met the buyout clause in his contract. Barca added the demand was lodged against Neymar on August 11 with Barcelona's employment court, eight days after his stunning move to Ligue 1.

The Catalan giants have also passed the claim onto FIFA and the French Football Federation via the Spanish Football Federation to take what they see as ""the appropriate legal effects"".

ap

Moreover, Barca urged PSG to pay the amount they are seeking if Neymar -- who is reported to earn 30 million euros after tax for the next five years in Paris -- isn't able to meet their demands.

The club's latest move comes two days after Neymar fiercely criticised Barcelona's under-fire board after scoring twice in a stunning home debut as PSG beat Toulouse 6-2 on Sunday.

""There are people in charge that shouldn't be there,"" Neymar told reporters.

""Barca deserve much more and everyone knows that.""

Barcelona have also withheld a 26 million euro bonus due to Neymar for signing the renewal to his contract last year.

Placebo As Real Remedy,"Your attitude, lifestyle, mental balance and emotional harmony are the best placebos, writes MUKUL SHARMA



Although mentioned in this column earlier, but to reiterate in a revised context, Norman Cousins was a distinguished editor of the Saturday Review for the better part of 40 years, author, professor, political activist and world peace advocate. During the course of his long career he won several accolades including the United Nations Peace Medal, the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism, and Pope John XXIII’s personal medallion. In 1964, however, his life took an unimaginable turn which was to ultimately make him far more famous — and controversial at times too — than he could ever arguably have been otherwise. After returning from a trip to the former USSR, he fell ill and was diagnosed as suffering from a suddenonset case of the crippling connective tissue disease which is also referred to as a collagen disease. Experts at more advanced clinics confirmed this and added a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis as well.He was told he had one chance in 500 to survive and given a few months to live, at that. Now Cousins who dabbled in biochemistry and behavioural medicine from time to time read and discovered that both his disease and the medicines were apparently depleting his body of vitamin C, among other things.



He decided to develop his own recovery programme. Accordingly he did three things. One, he got out of hospital against the advice of his doctors and checked himself into a hotel suite nearby; two, he started watching huge amounts of comedy films like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and Candid Camera; and, three, he began taking daily megadoses of vitamin C — way above the recommended dosages and in life-threatening proportions. But within six months he was back on his feet, and within two years he was able to return to his full-time job at the Saturday Review. He chronicled his experiences in the best-selling 1979 book Anatomy Of An Illness As Perceived By The Patient. When Cousins had a heart attack 15 years following his earlier illness,he wondered whether it would be possible to recover from two life-threatening conditions in one lifetime, but he was determined that he could. As he was brought into the hospital on a stretcher following the attack, he sat up and said, “Gentlemen, I want you to know that you’re looking at the darnedest healing machine that’s ever been wheeled into this hospital.” Once again Cousins recovered fully and wrote The Healing Heart: Antidotes To Panic And Helplessness.



He finally died in 1990, ten years after his first heart attack, sixteen years after his collagen illness, and twenty-six years after his doctors first diagnosed heart disease. So what’s the new context we’re talking about here now? Well, since Norman Cousins’time it has been unequivocally demonstrated by experiment after experiment that taking hefty outsized doses of vitamin C could have had no effect whatsoever on ankylosing spondylitis.And though laughter can help boost the immune system, it can’t possibly do so to such a ridiculous extent. The incredible effects had to be the result of the placebo effect where if the patient sincerely believes in the efficacy of a surreptitiously administered fake medicine — it still works. When Cousins was later confronted by this scientific evidence, he simply said that given another similar health problem, he would do exactly the same even if he knew it was a nonfunctional medication. Turns out he wasn’t wrong. Recent research at the Harvard Medical School has shown that even when people know they’re getting a fake medication — like being told upfront that it’s a placebo — they get better nonetheless and actually prefer it over what physicians would normally prescribe. It seems one’s attitude, lifestyle, outlook,mental balance and emotional harmony make the best placebo of them all.Yoga teachers and Zen masters have been saying the same thing all along.¦"
Here Are 16 Inside Pics Of 'Operating Room-Themed Restaurant' Where 'Doctors' Become Chefs,"An Egyptian restaurant D.

Uttarakhand Assembly Elections 2017,
"This day, 75 years ago: Contrary to dogma RSS did take part in the freedom movement, including Quit India movement","Prime Minister Narendra Modi evoked the significance of the month of August in India’s freedom movement in a recent Mann ki Baat – today, for instance, is the 75th anniversary of the launch of the Quit India movement. True to form, Congress and the Left were quick to taunt him about the role of his parent organisation, RSS, in that movement.

This was expected – political discourse and academic writings, comprising mainly history textbooks, have for decades incessantly slandered RSS for its alleged communal and pro-British role during the anti-colonial movement. History, however, suffers distortion whenever the present is used to contextualise the past guided by ideological predisposition. Facts reveal an altogether different reality from Marxist and Nehruvian historians’ narratives on RSS.

RSS cadre strength was assessed as nearly 1,50,000, spread among various age groups across the country, in the Home Department’s 1939-40 report on volunteer organisations. The British government initiated a recruitment drive for the army, ARP and Civic Guards when World War II broke out. The Hindu Mahasabha and many other Hindu organisations – which included Nathuram Godse’s Hindu Rashtra Sena – viewed this as an opportunity to militarily train their cadres for waging war against the British at an opportune time. They fully cooperated in organising camps and acted as recruiting agents.

RSS, however, rejected this outlook outright, a fact that wasn’t ignored by the regime. In June 1939, the Home Department suggested the Central Provinces government use Section 16 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (XIV of 1908) to ban RSS, by then the strongest outfit in the province. The province’s chief secretary GM Trivedi wrote to the central government on May 22, 1940, that it was not feasible as it would lead to huge protests in the province.

In the 1930s, even the use of softer methods to curb RSS had brought wrath and humiliation upon the government. The Sangh’s decision to participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement erased the government’s delusion that it was a tail of the Hindu Mahasabha. CP & Berar police’s fortnightly report stated that RSS founder Hedgewar’s participation had invigorated the movement. He led thousands of sataygrahis and suffered a year’s rigorous imprisonment.

The Sangh’s anti-British stance now invited suppression by an infuriated government. The Home Department report stated, “Of late, the Sangh has started taking interest in political movements of the country, as a result of which the CP government in their circular letter No 2352-2158 IV; dated 15/16 December 1932, was compelled to issue an order warning government servants of the communal and political nature of the Sangh, and forbidding their becoming members or participating in the organisation’s activities.”

After a two-day discussion on the ideology, organisation and the role of the RSS on March 7-8, 1934, the government was completely isolated and failed to prove RSS involvement in communal activities. House leader Raghvendra Rao failed to answer MS Rahman’s query on any representation by any Muslim individual or organisations against RSS or of any evidence the government had on its communal activities. Rahman and others praised the RSS; the government had to withdraw its circular.

On August 5, 1940 under the Defence of India Rules, the central government promulgated an ordinance prohibiting drills, use of uniforms and exercises. Any idea that this would stymie the Sangh’s mobilisation proved futile. Hundreds of RSS volunteers courted arrest in violation of the order.

RSS participation in the Quit India movement was the proverbial last straw for British rulers. In August that year, in Chimur and Ashti, RSS cadre dominated Congress processions and attacked police stations, with police in these talukas coming forth with the severest repression of the people. Those hanged and awarded life imprisonment were mostly RSS volunteers. The Sangh’s growing integration with the movement created consternation; the government feared an armed coup with RSS and Indian National Army (INA) sharing common sentiments.

British anxiety had good reason. A report warned that RSS volunteers had “infiltrated into various departments of the government such as the army, navy, post & telegraphs, railways and administrative services so that there may be no difficulty in capturing administrative departments when the time comes”. It further stated “the organisation is intensely anti-British and its tone is increasingly becoming militant.”

The noting of Home Department official GA Ahmed, on December 13, 1943, unravels the government’s real intention: “the holding of all camps by any organisation whatever should be prohibited by an order under the Defence of India Rules. This will hit the RSS most, as its main activity is the organisation of camps.” Subsequently, the Sangh’s training camps were raided and literature and arms were seized, besides the arrest of organisers.

RSS participation in Gandhian movements did not annihilate its instinct and ambition to overthrow colonial rule by armed revolution. The Sangh’s weakness is not its absence from the freedom movement, but lack of intellectual rigour among its own academics.

Conversely, communists’ privilege flows not from their participation in any national movement (their treacherous role in the freedom movement is well known), but from a strong contingent of committed academics. We owe it to ourselves not to allow the nation’s history to be circumscribed by ideological dogmas any longer."
Two leaves and a lotus bud,"After AIADMK merger, BJP can say cheers but not uncork the bottle

On Monday morning, festoons welcoming BJP leader Amit Shah flanked Chennai’s Grand Southern Trunk Road and Mount Road all the way from the airport to T Nagar, where the BJP’s state headquarters stand. On most of the posters, at Shah-ji’s feet was the lotus party’s state chief, a vivacious gynaecologist with a broad smile, flashing a ‘thumbs up’. On a few others was another ambitious woman leader doing a more courteous ‘vanakkam.’ In the few remaining vacant spots on the road medians, a certain Mr Naidu, with goggles and all, managed to install his modest hoardings joining the leaders in ushering in Shah: Come, come (varuga, varuga)! Amit Shah didn’t come.

Chennai, meanwhile, was hosting another drama— that of the merger of two AIADMK factions led by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) and his predecessor O Panneerselvam (OPS). OPS now becomes the deputy chief minister with the finance portfolio, and the coordinator of the party steering committee. After J Jayalalithaa’s death in December last year, the party had split into two, then three, the third one led by Jayalalithaa aide V K Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dhinakaran. In a way, the BJP festoons hadn’t gone waste—it was an inadvertent celebration of BJP having successfully orchestrated the reunion of the AIADMK groups.

Tamil Nadu governor C Vidyasagar Rao with O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami after the AIADMK factions merged on Monday

The logic was simple: The BJP wanted the AIADMK, which has 50 members in Parliament, to stay alive at least till the 2019 general elections. The saffron party needed the Tamil Nadu MPs’ support in getting crucial legislation passed and, when the elections came, a regional party to sail with. The withering party of two leaves fitted the bill perfectly. With a menacing stick (the threat of raids by central agencies on AIADMK leaders who refused to fall in line) and a tantalising carrot (a cabinet berth or two when Modi-ji returns to power in 2019, as even opposition leaders admit), Amit Shah tamed the meek AIADMK.

But the circus has just begun. TTV, who went from being an accidental leader to an anarchist in eight months, is plotting his revenge. Despite a much-retweeted sore throat that started around the same time the AIADMK merger happened, TTV ordered some 19 MLAs to the Raj Bhavan, demanding EPS be removed as chief minister. A more optimistic TTV count puts his support base at 27, including three ministers and three legislators who are unattached to the AIADMK, but won on the party symbol.

Time for some math. TTV’s 27 can’t rock the EPS-OPS boat on their own. But if their rebellion has the tacit support of the 89-member DMK, which has indicated its eagerness to introduce a no-confidence motion in the Assembly, the government is in troubled waters. The opposition, including Congress (8) and Indian Union Muslim League (1) has a combined strength of 98 in the 234-member House where Jayalalithaa’s seat remains vacant. If the 19 legislators who called on the governor on Tuesday support a no-confidence motion that the opposition would vote for, the numbers would cross the half mark of 117.

Suddenly, M K Stalin is the star. The DMK working president, who has waited too long for the AIADMK government to collapse under its own contradictions, is under pressure from within his party and outside to pull the rug. A Stalin advisor told me last month that the leader didn’t want to be seen as a destabilising factor, but now he is aware that “people are getting impatient to see this non-performing government go.”

Sooner the better, agree DMK strategists. For, giving more time for the AIADMK would also mean giving the BJP more time to handhold and handshake, and imparting a semblance of acceptance to the government. The BJP could then partake the glory to gain a few electoral points that the saffron brigade so badly needs to complete its footprint which has been sparse in the Dravidian land.

TTV is in a rage. And if Stalin proves to be strategically sound, it may not yet be time for Amit Shah and mitron to uncork the Patanjali brhami sharbat."

3. From Shabana Azmi To Farhan Akhtar, Bollywood Applauds Supreme Court's Ruling On Triple Talaq

“The Supreme Courts against instant triple talaq is a welcome measure. Triple talaq in one go does not have sanction and is patently unjust and anti-women. More than 20 Muslim countries have banned it and it has no place in secular India,” Shabana Azmi told TOI. Farhan Akhtar also expressed his happiness on the same. “The way the society is moving forward, the focus that is there on women’s rights and equality, and the fight for gender equality. It is very healthy that such a decision has been made. Now there is a >six month window to figure out how it should be translated into a law, I hope it happens. Because it is a very archaic practice, it is time for it to go.”

In an interview to Hindustan Times, Toshi said, “Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan don’t know about us. Hamare bachche ke bare mein humein pata hai naah ki hamara bacha kaisa hai! Uska nature hai waisa… Agle hi pal woh khelne chali jaati hai. Agar aap usko chod do toh woh kahengi main mazzak kar rahi thi. Uske nature ki wajah se chod denge toh woh padai bhi nahi kar paayengi.”

In the last episode, the Night King had killed the dragon and turned him into a Wight--the ice dragon. Since then all the discussions are revolving around the Night King, the cold-hearted evil who leads the army of the dead. While fans say they loved Richard Brake more in the role, still Twitter is going gaga over Vladimir Furdik AKA the Night King, who they think is a hottie."
"Open letter to incoming CJI: The most pressing priorities before India’s judiciary, and how to address them","Respected CJI designate,

You are about to head the world’s most populous functioning democracy’s apex court, the planet’s most dynamic judicial institution, a final court with globally the highest degree and scope of judicial review, the global inventor of basic structure theory and PIL and the Indian institution in which maximum faith is reposed by over 1.25 billion Indians. Any wish list for such a powerful and all encompassing institution is bound to be overflowing. I will, due to exigencies of space, limit mine to a few priorities.

Firstly, you and your successor Chief Justices, down to the last known one presently on the bench, should sit down together at least once every two months to create and then monitor the implementation of one, two and five year plans for the entire judiciary, including your court. It is tragic that for the last 70 years such plans have not even been formulated with a minimum perspective of five years, subsuming sub plans for shorter periods.

This is especially vital since most of you have roughly one year (or shorter) Chief Justiceships (with one exception reaching two years). On the many fundamental issues on which the brethren may and do have disagreements, you should agree to disagree and leave them aside to be decided by each incumbent CJI.

Secondly, this agreed five year perspective plan must not be changed for any reason, except fine tuning and calibration for better achievement. Synergistic results are bound to follow. The practice of each CJI anxious to stamp his own brand of policy tends to create transitory and disruptive paradigms, precluding accelerated cumulative consequences.

Thirdly, an example of Thomas Hardy’s admonition “Take care of the small things and the big things will take care of themselves” arises in the case of our collective war on the biggest scourge of judicial arrears and backlog, besmirching the otherwise glorious face of the Indian judiciary. Since your colleagues have now firmly re-established the primacy of the collegium for judicial appointments at all except the district court level, why is it not possible to establish a flow chart which is uniform, unchangeable and institutional (not personal) to expedite appointments? The single biggest reason for backlog is unfulfilled vacancies, reaching a peak of 450 out of a total 1,100 high court judges about a year ago (plus a normal 25-33% vacancy amongst the lower judiciary, where appointments fall within the jurisdiction of the respective HCs).

This flow chart must ensure throwing up names at least six months before a SC or HC vacancy. The process must be managed by a senior non-legal, non-judicial managerial officer whose only job is to see that a judicial replacement is known at least a fortnight before the incumbent’s retirement. The flow chart must factor in that there are serious delays and stalemates amongst yourselves, but that can be taken care of by constantly throwing up names at least three times the number of vacancies.

Irrespective of the merits of the appointment, the rigidity of the “pre-retirement fortnight rule” will ensure that your whole team works to a deadline. It will obviate serious hit wickets and self-goals like the apex court committed while adopting a self-defeating standstill policy of non-meeting of collegium and non-appointment of anyone while the NJAC hearing and judgment process was on for almost 18 months.

Fourthly, having reiterated the exclusive jurisdiction of the apex court regarding judicial appointments, you as a judicial collectivity cannot adopt a policy of “prepared to strike afraid to wound”. If there are deliberate and persistent government-related reasons for delay in clearing files, it is time you began to exercise coercive powers reaching upto and including contempt against secretary and even ministerial level functionaries to ensure timely appointments. There can be no dyarchy of appointment power in practice despite a definitive SC judgment asserting exclusivity of the collegium (this comes from a supporter of the NJAC Bill like me; final SC orders must be final in letter and spirit).

Lastly, it is time that the collegium started adopting a uniform marking system for HC and SC elevations, even if it is destroyed immediately after the event. My wish list would be an equal weightage on quality of judgments written, integrity issues and a residual category of all other factors like temperament, experience, etc. The headings, though important, are less important than the fact that they must be uniform and intergenerationally consistent, forcing the various collegiums to have some uniformity of focus.

Ideally, one of your Committee of CJIs or one amongst the collegium should, like the erstwhile Sultan of folklore, sit in the court of potential appointees, disguised and completely anonymous, and report back. Physical reality is often shockingly different from paper reality! Since that will never happen, a group of 10 senior advocates of each court should be informally consulted.

None of this is rocket science. It arises from the experience of each one of us who have spent a lifetime at the Bar. It presupposes a reasonably bona fide attempt to improve the speed and quality of judicial appointments. It does not presuppose an ideal world without “the politics of the judiciary” or the “politics of the political system” but seeks to accommodate those realities. It is a great opportunity for you to start. I have no doubt that you will get full collegiate support. But even if you do not, it’s is always better to try and fail rather than fail to try."

Fashion Diaries: Here’s Why Our Phones Have Become The Most Important Part Of Our Wardrobe Nowadays,"PARTNER

If there is one thing you literally cannot live without, it is your phone! Throughout the day, our phone accompanies us wherever we go, and even at night, it stays by our pillow-side. It has become our go-to accessory which induces a bag-scrabbling panic if it even momentarily disappears from our sight. Well, of course, because we practically cannot survive without it! But the recent trend on the hotline is that phones are not only meant for calling/texting but have become an essential fashion accessory!

When I came to know about this fashion fad, it was then that I actually started noticing all the fashion-conscious folks around me, and boy was I surprised! Here are some style-bits I gathered about how our phone becomes an important part of our wardrobe (this will help you increase your style quotient too):

The exterior colour of the phone is a super-important criteria nowadays to match one’s fashion sense.

OPPO F3

After asking my techie friends to suggest the best configuration (OS, RAM and other stuff) while zeroing on buying a phone, the last but a very important step of my purchase is deciding the colour. Because, ultimately when we carry our phone for a party or a business meeting, the choice of colour on our phone actually leaves a long-lasting impression! The latest colour that everyone’s going gaga over is Rose Gold. It is classy and sophisticated yet casual and trendy, so even fashionistas like Deepika Padukone are vouching for it big-time.

It has become a dressing-up accessory that is synced up with the entire wardrobe of a trendsetter.

OPPO F3

Just like we match up our accessories with our dress- be it a pair of earrings, neck-piece or even a watch, now even our phone has become that style accessory that adds up an additional note of spark to our entire look.

And the matching game sometimes takes on head-to-toe. Quite literally!

Pinterest

Well, a fashion trailblazer would definitely not leave even a bit of their wardrobe unattended. So, if it’s a Rose Gold phone, then the color theme is set for the entire wardrobe, head-to-toe!

Umpteen times a day, the sleek & handy selfie-camera phone keeps the style-check spot on.

OPPO F3

Well, selfies come handy not just to change display pictures, but when we need to check our pretty faces anywhere, anytime. And if on some days, if we look a bit too extra cute, why not click a selfie and save it too, right? And if you use a Selfie Expert phone, your picture is bound to look even prettier. If you want more, nowadays they even have a beauty mode btw!

And when friends are around, the selfie-game gets even better!

OPPO F3

Because when we are with our favourites, we are always in our happy and cheerful spirits which totally reflects on our pictures too. With a wide-angle group selfie, we can even get a full-length selfie to compare each other's style quotient!

One last word: Our phone's style quotient speaks a lot about our fashion diaries.

Pinterest

That’s why, nowadays people focus not just on the colour of the phone, but even on extra-accessories for it such as phone cases, bedazzlements or extra-customizations. Recently, even Bollywood style-icon Deepika Padukone had customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as the #F3DeepikaEdition.

OPPO F3

She had designed her own icon with OPPO, which has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded along, at the back of the phone and it pretty much signifies her personality, isn’t it? The special Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie, a 16 MP selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

So, dear style-divas if you are planning on buying a new phone, go for a Rose Gold OPPO F3, it’s pretty much going to be your new personal stylist!"

De Villiers gives up ODI captaincy; available to play all three formats

South African batsman AB de Villiers has stepped down as the captain of the One-Day International side with immediate effect. With so much speculation surrounding his Test future, de Villiers also made it clear on Wednesday (August 23) that he will be available to play in all three formats of the game from late September when South Africa begin their home season.

He last led South Africa in ODIs during the Champions Trophy in May-June, which ended in major disappointment as the side couldn't even make it past the Group Stages. Following the tournament, he had to fill in temporarily for Faf du Plessis as the T20I skipper for the series against England.

Making the announcement through a video released on his app, de Villiers felt that it was time for someone else to take over the role. He also pulled his weight behind Faf du Plessis, who has done a good job leading the Test and T20I teams.

Looking forward to a great summer #ProteaFire pic.twitter.com/yojybIrvjZ — AB de Villiers (@ABdeVilliers17) August 23, 2017

""Faf du Plessis has proved to be an outstanding captain of the T20 and Test teams, and bearing this in mind, I've informed Cricket South Africa that I would like to step down as captain of the ODI team,"" de Villiers said. ""It has been an honour to lead the team for the past six years, but it is now time for somebody else to lead the ODI team forward.""

There has been a lot of speculation and even disappointment among fans, about him opting out of Test matches. It has led to much concern over his future in the longest format of the game. De Villiers last played a Test in January 2016, against England, and has since been unavailable due to either injury or workload concerns. Addressing those doubts, de Villiers completely dismissed suggestions that he was putting himself before the team.

""A lot has been said and written over the past 12 months and I feel it is time to make my position absolutely clear,"" de Villiers stated. ""Over the past year or so, I've tried to manage my commitments. I've felt mentally and physically tired. Playing in all three formats ever since 2004 has taken its toll. Together with Cricket South Africa, we've tried to develop a viable schedule which allows me to prolong my career for as long as possible. This strategy has prompted some people to say that I'm picking and choosing when to play for the Proteas and even to suggest I'm somehow putting myself before the team. This is simply not true. Playing for South Africa is and will always be the greatest privilege of my life.

""Following this recent break, I really do feel refreshed and revived. I want to get back on the field and I have assured the national selectors that I'll be available for selection in all three formats of the game during the coming season. There is plenty of hard work ahead in the nets and I must prepare properly. But I'll be ready to play, if required, from the middle of October onwards.""

South Africa's next assignment is against Bangladesh, when they come touring in late September. The tour begins with a two-Test series, followed by three ODIs and two T20Is.

Daughters of India have a new hero and role model: Shayara Bano,"Today the Supreme Court of India found the practice of triple talaq, or talaq-e-biddat, violative of the fundamental right contained in Article 14 of the Constitution, which provides all persons equality before the law – prohibiting discrimination on grounds of religion, caste, sex etc. It’s a momentous judgment in the life of our nation. We can be sure that its implications will unfold in many ways in the years and decades to come – likely empowering not just Muslim women, in fact not just women but also other subjects of discrimination, in their struggle for equality.

While there has long been mainstream consensus that triple talaq brutalizes women, it survived so far in the name of religion. In this it is only one of many practices like nikah halala, polygamy, unequal inheritance rights, unequal guardianship rights, and unequal access to places of worship – where women continue to be subjected to discrimination in the name of religion and tradition. In this sense today’s victory is not the end of the fight but just the beginning.

For a brutalized woman the fight can seem daunting, the rewards uncertain, the journey uphill and sometimes backbreaking. The question she asks herself is, what difference can I make? But what a difference Shayara Bano has made. She was the first petitioner in the case that made history today. Fifteen years of marriage came to an abrupt end for her when in 2015 she was served a talaqnama via Speed Post. To underline, her husband ended the marriage unilaterally and instantaneously, with a letter in which talaq was written thrice. Unlike the millions of other women who have suffered similar injustice in silence, she went to court.

Petitioners Aafreen Rehman, Gulshan Parveen, Ishrat Jahan and Atiya Sabri joined her. Lawyers like Indira Jaising and collectives like Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan and the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board stood like rock next to her. From all over India support poured in from Muslim and Hindu women alike. A solidarity grew where a woman had been abandoned, alone and browbeaten.

Shayara Bano calls pushing triple talaq into history’s dustbin “a milestone on the road to reforms”. It’s a pretty distinguished milestone. It guarantees her a place in tomorrow’s textbooks. She has emerged as a hero of modern India. Her story should now be told to all the daughters of India, to make them stronger and aware of their rights and ready to stand up for them.

As the Attorney General submitted to Supreme Court, “Gender justice [is] a constitutional goal of overwhelming importance and magnitude, without accomplishing the same half of the country’s citizenry would not be able to enjoy to the fullest – their rights, status and opportunities.”

Politicians are trying to hijack today’s victory. But it belongs to the women of India and to everyone who values the fundamental right to equality."

‘In India-China standoff all sides know that going beyond point of no return will cost everyone and destroy all our dreams’,"As China becomes more aggressive in its external posture, the India-China standoff in Doklam is being watched closely across the Asean region. Thailand’s ambassador to India Chutintorn Gongsakdi spoke to Jiby J Kattakayam about how the border confrontation in Bhutan is being perceived in the wider region, India’s Act East policy and why, despite ancient civilisational linkages, it has taken 70 years of Indo-Thai diplomatic ties for trade and cultural exchanges to enter a higher trajectory:

Does the Indo-China standoff in Doklam on the eastern front worry Asean?

It is a standoff where all sides know that going beyond a point of no return is going to cost everyone and is going to destroy all our respective dreams. I believe that people have the good sense to not go beyond a standoff. Coming from an economics background, it does not make any sense to me for any of these flashpoints to explode.

How do you see the atoll-building activities of China in the South China Sea?

We always like to see countries resolving issues on the negotiating table. It is difficult to have black and white outcomes in border issues, but it has been shown in the past that we can live and work amicably and in the spirit of good neighbourliness. It is not in anyone’s interest in the region or outside for potential flashpoints to explode. People have tested each other, but have not come to blows.

Where is the India-Myanmar-Thailand tri-lateral highway at?

While maritime and air connectivity are important, the highway has great symbolism. The political leadership is visualising our people driving and visiting each other by road. Some road stretches still need improvement. Customs and immigration quarantine facilities still need upgrading. I have been to the border. Trucks queue on the road, taking up valuable space and time. As things stand, the borders cannot support the trade we are visualising.

The highway can also connect India to Laos and Cambodia as well. Border posts and truck stops in Europe and in some parts of Asean are like mini cities. Once the highway is ready we cannot have all these trucks parked along the road creating huge roadblocks.

How are Thailand’s relations with China evolving?

We are a small country. We maintain good relations with all the players in the region. We have a longstanding and strategic relationship with the US. We have a long and close friendship with China. India is a more recent player. The relationship with India has more potential to develop. The relationship with China has developed over the years. As nations grow and find their own place in the global stage, the relationship will also reflect that. Our position is to maintain friendly relations with all and to see them play an appropriate and balancing role in the region.

In the World Bank’s ease-of-doing-business index, why is Thailand at 46 and India at 130?

One factor is Centre-state relationships. With GST, India will improve its rank massively next year because it unifies markets. We are unifying the Asean market as well. India is a good example of a government responding to people’s needs through reforms and not protectionism. The other problem which everyone has is corruption. Some Thai businesses ended their investments because of corruption and local people of influence.

We recently had a particularly bad experience with one Indian state. We haven’t given up on that state. The evolving nature of India is such that we do not give up on the country, or a state, but we will return when the state is more ready. We also advise Thai investors to have a local partner. It makes it easier to adapt to local business culture. While there is competition between Indian states, it is important to choose the right state where the chief minister has the attitude and willingness to help business.

How is Indo-Thai trade progressing?

Indo-Thai trade is doing well. It stands at around $7-8 billion per year which appears satisfactory. However, it can improve to $20 billion considering India’s and Asean’s massive markets. Thailand should be seen by India in the context of the Asean market of 600 plus million people. In this context, any country in Asean is a staging point for the whole Asean market.

I find our economies neatly complimenting each other. Manufacturing is our strength and is of interest to India. At the same time, Thailand needs services and information technology where India is ahead. I keep pointing out to Thai stakeholders that India is an emerging power. So my time in India is spent 40% on marketing Asean, 50% on marketing India and 10% on marketing Thailand, because when I am marketing Asean and India, I am serving my country’s interests."
Why Men Are More Likely To Be In A Grumpy Mood At Around 2pm In The Afternoon!,"As a guy, you’re prone to be a little a grumpy in the afternoon as compared to in the morning or evening hours. Not because we assume so because science says so!

cementmarketing.com

A recent study claims that men find their mood most slumped at around 2 pm in the afternoon!

Scientists from the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia came up with this conclusion after taking the brain scans of men during various times of the day.

yamuzhchina.ru

The reason the researchers stated was due to of the activation of the reward-processing brain regions of the brain at different times of the day.

The findings showed that activation of a reward-processing region of the brain peaks in the morning and evening and dips at 2 p.m.

For the study, published in The Journal of Neuroscience, the team compared activation of the brain's reward system in young men during a gambling task at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.

trend.ge

They found that activation in the left putamen was lowest in the early afternoon. This finding may parallel the drop in alertness people tend to feel in mid-afternoon, the researchers said.

""While the left putamen had the greatest activation at 10 a.m. and 7 p.m., it had significantly lowered activation at 2 p.m.,"" Jamie Byrne from the varsity was quoted as saying to Daily Mail.

""The left putamen is particularly responsive to unexpected rewards, so our data suggest that the brain's reward centres might be primed to expect rewards in the early afternoon and be surprised when they appear at the start and end of the day,"" Byrne added.

Understanding how activity in the brain's reward system changes throughout the day could have implications for depression, substance abuse and sleep disturbances, said Greg Murray from the Swinburne University in Australia.

"India Is 8th Most Cyber Attacked Nation In World, With Return Of An Old Deadly Malware In 2017","According to a new security report, India ranks eighth among countries across the world that are targeted by DDoS attacks.

Cloud delivery firm Akamai released its State of the Internet report for Q2 2017, and it shows that India not only suffers Distributed Denial of Service attacks, it’s also the 5th most popular source country for these attacks, with close to 12 million attacks sourced from here between Q3 2016 to Q2 2017.

According to the report, after three quarters showing a decline in the number of global DDos attacks, it rose by 28 percent once more this quarter. In fact, targets around the world are averaging 32 attacks during the quarter, up from 25 last quarter. The target with the highest number of incidents, a gaming company, clocked a whopping 558 attacks this quarter, an average of six times a day.

The US leads the top 10 list of countries most targeted by DDoS attacks, followed by the UK and Brazil. India places 8th on that list, rounded out by China and the Netherlands in the bottom two.

“Events like the Mirai botnet, the exploitation used by WannaCry and Petya, the continued rise of SQLi attacks and the re-emergence of PBot all illustrate how attackers will not only migrate to new tools but also return to old tools that have previously proven highly effective,” Martin McKeay, Senior Security Advocate at Akamai, said in a statement.

India was also a source for 5,224 of those DDoS attacks this quarter, making it the fifth-most popular source country, behind, Egypt, the US, Turkey, and China.

The real luxury in life is doing nothing,"It’s pretty much a foregone conclusion that you’ll brush your teeth tomorrow morning. You don’t squander precious mental space evaluating whether or not brushing your teeth is worth the opportunity cost of let’s say, another five minutes of sleep. The same is true for showering, going to the bathroom, grooming your nails and facial hair. We clean our homes with a myriad of dust-sucking devices and chemical concoctions, or hire people to do so more thoroughly than we can. We even make sure to wash the car every so often.

As a people, we seem to be pretty vigilant about physical hygiene. We clean and cream our bodies, and take them out for a walk, much like we do for our dogs. We do so robotically, without wasting time in evaluating questions like, “Should I take out the trash today?” Even if we don’t do it today, you can bet it’ll be done before the week is out. Sadly, the same cannot be said for our mental hygiene. When was the last time you really cleaned the crevices of your mind?

And in this day and age, boy, do we have dirty minds. Between jobs, responsibilities at home, nights out, baby-talk and toddler tantrums, must-read blogs, email upkeep, spritely posts and timely tweets, we’ve stuffed our minds with more content than it can hold. Our minds run a marathon a minute. We swallow countless videos, movies and entire seasons of television shows with abandon, and these stimulating stories stick to our soft and once-supple consciousness. It’s a more-more-more world and our mind’s had enough. Simply put, we are mentally obese.

And then we wonder why we can’t still our minds and find some semblance of peace. We read self-help manuals, eat more organic greens and practise various forms of sweat-inducing yoga. We buy softer clothes, sniff scented candles, wear noise-canceling headphones and track our daily step count. We run away to exotic islands and true stillness evades us even under the palms.

The ubiquitous sentence we’ve all uttered, heard and repeated is — “I’m so tired”. We keep going like that poor Energizer bunny, but deep inside we feel kind of exhausted. Even the pursuit of higher echelons of fun becomes somewhat tiring by the time you’re thirty-five. And if not by then, by forty-five, for sure. “What’s the point?” we start to wonder.

And this is precisely where meditation saved me. Some people meditate with a mantra from a Master, some listen to meditation music, some watch their breath until they can override mental chatter, while others go for a nature walk. Even big-shot billionaires meditate with requisite meditation apps on TV these days.

The result is the same — in meditation, we do absolutely nothing for a few moments. We achieve nothing, we stop trying so damn hard. And unlike in sleep, we are restfully awake to witness the passage of time. We are completely present for ourselves — for doing absolutely nothing with ourselves — much like we make sure to be present to watch our children play soccer or perform in a school play.

In meditation, we become the witness. We become the one who watches patiently as time marches on, moving and twisting as it does. We don’t react or move an inch. We watch our thoughts go by like trains at a busy train station. We don’t hop on board. Like the statue of Buddha, we learn to embody peace and let go of past and future worries. We are the now. Like rock climbing, scuba diving, skiing, or even learning to read as children — learning to meditate takes some level of dedication and practice.

It’s a skill worth acquiring as soon as humanly possible. Even a momentary brush with wakeful nothingness — doing nothing, being nothing, wanting nothing, all while being there with the Self here and now — is a deep-clean steam shower for our mind. It refreshes us considerably and reminds us that there is more to life than chasing more."
Can Yogi do more for electricity than gau raksha?,"Uttar Pradesh has long been one of the worst administered states. Children’s deaths in Gorakhpur recently hogged the headlines, but are hardly new. Ex-bureaucrat V Ramani has unearthed an RTI response showing that between January 1, 2009 and November 30, 2011, 31,791 children were admitted to the Gorakhpur hospital, and no less than 3,745 died, 1,311 of encephalitis. Half the qualified medical posts and 40% of nursing posts were vacant. Similar problems afflict every sector in UP.

Like many predecessors, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has promised to overhaul governance. During a recent visit to Lucknow, two senior bureaucrats told me the Yogi was more serious than any chief minister for decades, and was not simply a Hindutva fanatic. Yet UP’s history has long been one of broken promises and dismal outcomes. Poor governance is deeply embedded, and will resist overhaul.

There are some green shoots. One of the most difficult areas to reform in any state is electricity. Huge subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers have plunged most state electricity boards deep into the red. Chief ministers need to bite the bullet and push through major tariff hikes and reductions in theft.

The Yogi has bitten the bullet. The state has proposed tariff hikes of up to 360% for different categories of rural and urban domestic consumers, the average hike being 22.6%. Industry rates have not been raised at all — the state wants to attract industry, and its rates are already high. This is the very opposite of the populism typical of a new chief minister.

Can UP follow the Gujarat model? There, companies in generation, transmission and distribution all show profits. As Chief Minister, Modi cracked down on power theft, raised tariffs, metered and supplied power to almost all villages, and bifurcated electric feeders to villages. This enabled him to supply 24×7 power for domestic use and six hours per day for agricultural pumps.

Profitable industrial and commercial consumers account for 52% of consumption in Gujarat, against only 30% in UP, which cannot therefore depend on cross-subsidies from industry for farmers. It currently loses Rs 2.07 on every unit of power supplied. Apart from subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers, power theft and corruption are rampant. The state’s Aggregate Commercial and Technical (ACT) losses average 31% across its distribution companies. The Yogi seeks to slash this to 23% in a year, a huge challenge.

Technical losses in transmission should not exceed 8-9% of supply. Anything more represents theft and corruption. ACT loss is a whopping 60% in Meerut, where politically powerful vote banks and industries have long siphoned off power in collusion with corrupt electricity officials.

Checking theft requires strong police support. But police stations in UP are under-staffed and fully occupied with major crimes and public order. They have no time or staff to check electricity theft: unfilled vacancies for constables exceed one lakh.

Yogi’s radical reform proposal is to create one new police station in every district dedicated to checking electricity theft. That can be a game changer. A senior official says, “This is the first government in my time to say we should go after all thieves without exceptions or mercy.” Brave words, but implementation has never been the state’s strong point.

Following court orders, exams are being held to hire one lakh constables. These will be based largely on objective questions in a written exam, not school marks, since cheating is so rampant that school marks mean nothing.

The state’s ‘Electricity For All’ scheme aims to electrify every household by October 2018. That means doubling the current number of connections: an additional 1.12 crore rural and 15 lakh urban consumers are to be covered. Up to 10 lakh diesel gensets of farmers will also be converted to electricity. The Yogi claims rural power supply is up from 12 to 18 hours per day. Grassroots reports suggest substantial improvement though not to the extent claimed. Critics, including buffalo traders and meat processors, say the Yogi is keener on cow protection than electricity.

Officials claim that in four months, the BJP government has metered 3.25 lakh unmetered connections, and provided 12.5 lakh new connections. They say in the April-June quarter, electricity supply rose 18% while revenue jumped 30%, reflecting better collection.

Will this be sustained? Will the BJP resist the temptation to waive rural electricity dues when the next election approaches? Is the Yogi serious enough, and bureaucracy honest and efficient enough, to stop power theft and collect bills? Let’s see. The Yogi’s power reforms have started well, but have miles to go."
Narendra Modi’s black money claim from Red Fort at variance with Finance Ministry,"One of the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech was his solid defence of demonetisation coupled with claims of having unearthed huge amounts of black money from the system. But data available in the public domain suggests that Modi’s claims need to be taken with a pinch of salt. As per Modi, demonetisation has resulted in almost Rs two lakh crore of black money finding its way back to the banking system.

But this claim is at variance with multiple public statements issued by Finance minister Arun Jaitley and his junior minister Santosh Gangwar between December 2016 and August 1, 2017 which together show that government had no clear estimate of black money in this period. So, either the PM has received new information since or there is a contradiction in claims made by Finance Ministry and PMO.

Here is what Finance Ministry has been saying on black money estimates so far before Modi’s Red Fort speech:

1. August 1, 2017: Minister of State for Finance, Santosh Gangwar said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha that there was no official estimation of quantum of black money in India. The reply mentions that demonetisation was introduced with a view to curbing financing of terrorism through the proceeds of fake Indian currency notes.

2. July 21, 2017: In a written reply to Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley mentioned there is no official estimation of quantum of black money stashed by Indians in foreign countries or foreign banks. On unaccounted wealth, his statement mentions that the government has commissioned a study on estimation of unaccounted wealth and income which will be conducted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM).

3. April 7, 2017: Gangwar said in Lok Sabha that there is no official estimation of the amount of black money in form of old Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 that have not been deposited during the course of the demonetisation drive. This means that the government is not in a position to say if the money that has not come in after demonetisation is illegitimately earned or otherwise.

"Despite Jab Harry Met Sejal's Failure, Imtiaz Ali Stands By His Film & Says It's Not Regressive","They say criticism is the best teacher but for many of us, it doesn't go down too well. For directors, a film is like their baby and nothing can hit you more than it tanking at the box-office.

For Imtiaz Ali, box-office success has never mattered much. Apart from Jab We Met and Rockstar, none of his films proved out to hit but that in no way has fizzled out his love for Cinema. People love him for his thought-process, his flawed love stories and the way his erratic love stories turn out.

His latest film Jab Harry Met Sejal became a fragile victim of online bullying and wrath of people. From calling him out for sketching regressive characters to claiming that it is his weakest film till date, people went overboard with their criticism this time.

Red Chillis

But for Imtiaz, his craft and heart matter to him more than anything else. Apart from standing by his film, he accepts that he might have failed this time but he also asked the audience to have faith in him.

Just a few days ago, he shared his picture with a beautiful message. He thanked people for liking and disliking his film and he wrote how he is looking forward to making better films.

And yesterday, he chose FB live to interact with the fans and followers. The live-session lasted for one hour and he patiently chose to answer all the accusations, criticism and questions people had about his latest offering that failed to leave a mark.

From explaining Sejal‘s desperation to be ‘worthy’ of Harry to the scene where Sejal refers to herself as not a ‘ghatiya‘ woman who runs away with his Tour-guide, Imtiaz patiently answered the questions and defended his work.

1. He went on to explain why SRK didn't come with any superstar baggage. Rather, he was one of the easiest actors he has worked with. He said,

Viral Bhayani

""Shah Rukh is a very easy person to work with since he's a theatre actor. I don't have to change anything because of his persona but I do change a lot of things as I go along. There were things that changed but not because Shah Rukh imposed it on me.""

2. He also spoke about the flak that the film received online. Talking about all the nasty things that people have written and said about his film, he said,

Red Chillies

""I have never received an overwhelmingly positive review of any. I am old enough to not take criticism negatively even if the criticism is negative. I believe a lot is achieved by constructive criticism than say, dishonest praise. I do stand by Jab Harry Met Sejal. This is the movie I wanted to make. Don't worry too much about critics. Sometimes they say valuable things which we must acknowledge. I am sure it'll help me make better films as I always find a way of benefitting from criticism. ""

3. And then he decided to talk about the pink elephant in the room-Sejal's character and obsessive behaviour on getting sexual validation from Harry. Many pointed out that it is one of the most regressive characters Imtiaz has ever written. Defending his character, he said,

Red Chillis

""That's a question Anushka has asked me often. I feel that when girls grow up, they, through some ways that are not even nice, get to know about their worth in terms of a physical being – whether they are attractive, beautiful, sexy and so on. And even now, there aren't any ways where a girl can know if she is attractive to a man. Even now we find all of that (probably referring to a woman's sexuality) as a taboo in Indian society and perhaps rightly so (?). For Anushka's character, she meets a man who she doesn't know and is not going to spend a lifetime with, or so she thinks. And he's honest about talking about himself and so she decides to ask him about her latent insecurities – which are about the way she appears.""

Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

NASA Predicts That A 4 Kilometer Wide Asteroid Will Zip Past Earth On 1 September,"Asteroids are whizzing past Earth all the time, though they don’t come too close to hitting us. NASA has now predicted another fly by the incident to occur next month, but it’s slightly different.

For one thing, the space agency is saying the rock that’ll hurtle past us is the largest near-Earth object (NEO) we’ve seen since we began tracking them 20 years ago.

Measuring 4.4 km across, asteroid Florence, as it’s called, is more than large enough to cause massive destruction, were it to hit Earth. Even the 20 m wide Chelyabinsk meteorite that made contact in 2013 wrought havoc, and any object larger than 1 km impacting Earth could cause a global extinction. And NASA has tracked over 880 such NEOs in our vicinity.

But, though asteroid Florence is about making its closest pass of Earth at a distance of 7 million km, the space agency there’s no chance of a collision anytime in the next 500 years.

“While many known asteroids have passed by closer to Earth than Florence will on September 1, all of those were estimated to be smaller,” says Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS). “Florence is the largest asteroid to pass by our planet this close since the NASA program to detect and track near-Earth asteroids began.”

The rock will zip past our planet on September 1, and will be visible to small telescopes for a few nights from late August to early September.

Astronauts' Urine Might Help In Getting Humans To Mars And Beyond,"When Matt Damon was stranded alone on the Red Planet in the movie ‘The Martian’, he used his own faeces mixed in with the dirt to fertilize the potatoes he was trying to grow. Of course, Matt Damon wasn’t the real astronaut, but it seems he had the right idea when it came to using human excrement for other purposes.

Yarrowia lipolytica cells under a microscope - Wikimedia Commons

Researchers from Clemson University are currently working on a way to convert astronauts’ sweat and urine into plastics that can be used to build tools on board a spacecraft.

The team is researching a strain of yeast called Yarrowia Lipolytica, one that astronauts would theoretically be able to imbue with carbon and nitrogen found in their excrements. The yeast would then act as a natural recycler, generating oils and fats that could be turned into bioplastics. The Clemson team are presenting their work at the 254th National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS).

If the process works according to plan, the yeast can be tweaked to create polyester, a material commonly used in clothing. However, instead of crafting uncomfortable urine shirts, the polyester can instead be fed into 3D printers, which could use the plastic to craft tools the astronauts need, whenever required.

This sort of research is crucial for deep space missions, where astronauts would be confined to a spacecraft for long periods of time with no chance of a resupply mission from Earth. The amount of cargo they could carry in that situation would be limited by the fuel reserves, so it would be easier to recycle trash to build new items than carrying spares.

In fact, astronauts on board the International Space Station already do that to a small extent. The spacefarers recycle their sweat and urine on board the ISS and purify it to make drinking water

But if those same astronauts can just visit the bathroom whenever a crucial tool breaks and make a new one, the possibilities are almost endless.

I've been threatening and creating chances: Broad,"BREAKING RECORDS

I've been threatening and creating chances: Broad

• Last updated on Mon, 21 Aug, 2017, 09:47 AM Rob Johnston in Birmingham

Stuart Broad admitted that it was a special feeling to become England's second-highest Test wicket-taker on the final day of the first Test against Windies at Edgbaston. When Broad bowled Shane Dowrich in the evening session of the final day with a ball that nipped back sharply, he moved to 384 Test wickets, overtaking Sir Ian Botham in the list of England's highest Test wicket-takers. James Anderson, Broad's great friend and opening partner, leads the list with 492 Test wickets.

""It's a really special day,"" Broad said on Saturday (August 19). ""I felt really good in that little spell of bowling [on the final evening]. It was probably the best 40 minutes of bowling I've had this summer."" After a frustrating start to Windies' innings - he had two catches dropped on the second evening - Broad's rewards came quickly as he took the five wickets he needed to overtake Botham across two of the visitors' innings on the third day.

It was, Broad admitted, extra special to have moved passed Botham, one of his boyhood heroes and one of the best cricketers England has ever produced. ""He's someone who has been a big influence on me, playing with my Dad, watching some of his performances against Australia,"" he said. ""He is a huge legend of English cricket but someone who has given back to this team. I was fortunate to get my first cap off him in 2007.

""In the past couple of years, he's spent more and more time in the changing room and guys really listen to him. He's someone who's passionate about English cricket and wants us to do well. I could tell he was genuinely proud and delighted that I've managed to go past him. That's testament to him,"" he added.

Broad has bowled well this summer without the rewards to show for it. He took just 11 wickets against South Africa but looked in good rhythm throughout that series and had not been unduly worried about his form. ""I feel like I've been threatening and creating chances,"" Broad said. ""If I save all my wickets for Australia I don't mind,"" he said.

On the third day in Birmingham, he picked up two wickets in the Windies' first innings and three in the second, bowling a full length at good pace. He took 3-17 in a seven-over spell in the final session which was somewhat reminiscent of some of the magical spells Broad has delivered during his Test career to date.

After dismissing Roston Chase and captain Jason Holder in successive balls, leaving him in joint second place with Botham, Broad could have gone passed the former all-rounder in style. The Edgbaston crowd willed him on but Broad's hat-trick ball was resolutely blocked by Kemar Roach although Dowrich was dismissed soon after.

Broad, who has played 107 Tests, is probably not given the credit he deserves for his exploits. His 384 wickets have come at the impressive average of 28.47 and he has taken 15 five-wicket hauls and two ten-fors. He will go down as one of England's finest-ever fast bowlers and it is perhaps his misfortune that his career has coincided with that of Anderson. Had it not, he may have got even more plaudits.

At 31, Broad will have plenty of opportunity to add to his haul. His injury record has been generally good and provided he stays fit and is managed well, achieving 500 Test wickets is by no means out of the question. ""I still feel like I've got quite a lot of cricket left in me,"" he said. ""I'm really enjoying being a part of this team at the moment. I'd certainly hope that my performances will keep improving so I'd be part of that 2019 Ashes. I'm not someone who looks too far ahead because I think it slows you down as a performer. You don't know if you'll have the luck with injuries.

""I play cricket for the competitive side of it. I love that feeling of being in a battle, that feeling with the new ball, getting an opening batsman out and they're desperate to

survive. That's the reason I play. I'll play as long as that drive is there. It's still within me now. As soon as that goes, I'll know that I'm gone.""

Broad is best known for the magic spells that have defined his career; his 8-15 against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2015, 6-17 against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2016, 5-37 against Australia at the Oval in 2009. Perhaps because of those standout performances, his consistency is often overlooked. Not since 2012 has he averaged more than 30 runs per wicket in a calendar year.

""My career has always been a little bit like that,"" Broad said. ""Pick up a two-fer, a two-fer and then get a six-fer out of nowhere."" Can he sense when he is on the cusp of one of those spells? ""I sort of can. I do feel light in my run-up. I make the batsmen play every ball. When I don't get it quite right, I get pushed in to fifth stump and get left. I really don't like being left, it feels like a waste of a run-up. I love batsmen playing forward defensives at me because if I get any sort of nibble, it brings both sides in.""

Broad will be a key player for England in this winter's Ashes, a series he thinks is going to be ""a belter"". Although, if England's management are considering resting him from one of the next two Tests against Windies to save him for Australia, they might have to think again. ""I will be politely suggesting that I will have sufficient rest in September and October to be available for the next two Tests against West Indies,"" he said.

"Triple Talaq: Time to divorce religion from inequality, exploitation and discrimination","The verdict of a five-member bench of the Supreme Court – the members representing five different faiths – marks a milestone in India’s legal history and has been widely hailed by all those who acknowledge that inequality, exploitation and discrimination, on the basis of gender or religion or social mores, has no place in a society which proudly proclaims itself to be the world’s most populous democracy.

The judgment, delivered by a 3:2 majority, ruled that triple talaq was open to ‘arbitrary and whimsical’ misuse and violated Muslim women’s constitutional right to equality.

Though two of the five judges recorded dissenting remarks – citing Article 25 of the Constitution which guarantees the fundamental right to religious freedom – it was deemed that triple talaq, whereby a man can divorce his wife by merely repeating the word ‘talaq’ three times, was not an integral part of Islam and as such could not be defended on the grounds of the liberty to follow the faith of one’s choice. Indeed, Islamic states like Pakistan and Bangladesh have abolished the practice.

The government is said to be unlikely to ban triple talaq, but in individual cases the matter can be taken up courts of law.

The SC ruling comes as a political plus point for the BJP government, and could prove to be a stepping stone to introducing a uniform civil code, which has long been on the lotus party’s agenda.

Even those who disagree with the BJP’s saffron ideology will agree that a common civil code, which doesn’t discriminate between religions, is not only appropriate but necessary in a polity which deems itself to be a secular republic.

While a consensus about a common code needs to evolve within the Muslim community, the debate should not be restricted to those of that particular faith but should involve all citizens of our diverse society which is bedrocked on the right to universal equality.

A common civil code is – or ought to be – above partisan politics. Because the right to equality is – or ought to be – common to us all, irrespective of faith or ideological hue."

PCB chairman confirms World XI tour in September

While World XI is set to play a three-match T20 series in September, West Indies will play three T20Is in late November. © Getty

Najam Sethi, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, put to rest all speculations regarding the World XI tour to Pakistan, confirming on Monday (August 21), a three-match Twenty20 series against Pakistan in Lahore, starting September 10. A 15-member squad led by former Zimbabwe great Andy Flower will take part in a seven-day long camp in Dubai before heading to Lahore for the series. However, the bigger news is Windies is set to tour the cricket-starved nation for a three-match T20I series in Lahore in late November.

Sethi also stated that the three games against World XI will be played across four days, but refused to divulge the dates citing security reasons.

""CWI and PCB are advancing discussions that will see the West Indies play three T20I matches in Lahore in late November,"" read the statement. ""In September, October and November, we'll have the World XI, we'll have Sri Lankan team and then the West Indies (come play in Pakistan).

""We just hope that the security we've promised, we'll keep it up. Sri Lanka have said they'll come after the World XI, provided the security is fine. It will be fine, Punjab government has indicated that the preparation are in full swing. At the end of this month, ICC's security team is also arriving. So far all signals are good,"" Sethi added. He also stated that talks with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) were still on over the number of games to be played.

While the Punjab Government approved 'Presidential level security' for the week-long World XI series in Lahore, Sethi expressed his desire to host a few games in the other cities too, notably Karachi. ""I have the desire to take some games out of Lahore and host them in Karachi, but everyone I speak to reject that idea. They tell me that we've succeeded in hosting something well in Lahore (PSL 2 final) so keep that going. First host the PSL in Karachi, then we will come there.""

Pakistan, who haven't hosted any high-profile international cricket ever since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009, lost their share of cricket matches during the 2011 World Cup which was co-hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The only teams who travelled to Pakistan in this period were Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. The peaceful hosting of the Pakistan Super League 2017 final in Lahore painted a positive image in their bid towards bringing international cricket back to their country.

""This is my objective. I had given myself a mission statement - to organise PSL, to bring it to Pakistan, to bring international cricket to Pakistan. Game development needs to be done, fund raising needs to be done - and all that we're going to do slowly. And I also want to try to professionalise PCB,"" Sethi said.

"Age Of Empires IV Is Confirmed! It's Been 12 Years Since Last Game, Coming To A PC Very Soon!","Sorry StarCraft fans, but the mother of all real-time-strategy games is coming out of hibernation!

Microsoft announced at Gamescom 2017 yesterday that it’s resurrecting a classic strategy game. The company has revealed that a new Age of Empires game will be coming to PC, developed by Relic Entertainment, the makers of the Dawn of War series.

The Age of Empires IV trailer released alongside depicts battles across the world through different stages of history, from the Roman Empire at the peak of its power, to Spanish conquistadors, tribals, revolutionaries, and samurai.

This is the first sequel to the game in 12 years, ever since Age of Empires III was launched in 2005. The original developers, Ensembles Studios, released the first Age of Empires way back in 1997. They were then later acquired by Microsoft in 2001, where it operated internally until 2009.

Despite the studio eventually being shut down that year, the Age of Empires brand has lived on as both a nostalgia title in gamers’ memories, and a source for spinoff games.

Prior to the trailer unveiling, Microsoft confirmed that Age of Empires II and III would also be receiving Definitive Editions, along the lines of the upcoming remaster of the first game in the series.

Age of Empires IV still doesn’t have a release date. However, Microsoft has announced that the series will also be receiving Definitive Editions, which are likely to drop sooner than the latest sequel."

This Drug Can Save Lakhs Of Mother's Lives During Child Birth & It's Been Lost For 50 Years!,"Way back in the 1960s, a female Japanese doctor developed a potent drug to help mothers who hemorrhage during childbirth. Not only was it affordable to to make and safe, it was also the perfect way to quickly stop bleeding and help clotting.

Dr Utako Okamoto hoped that her drug, tranexamic acid, would be used to save pregnant women’s lives in childbirth, but the formula went relatively unused for decades. That is, until now.

Researchers from the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, led by Haleema Shakur, have now demonstrated that tranexamic acid can decrease the risk of death from blood loss during childbirth by a third. The results are huge as it’s estimated that about 100,000 die of blood loss every year, soon after their baby is born.

The study also showed that the drug has no serious side effects, and doesn’t cause risks in the case of any other medical conditions. The researchers tested more than 20,000 women for the drug in nearly 200 hospitals across 21 countries, including well off ones like the UK, and poorer regions like Pakistan and Nigeria.

Most importantly, the drug is really cheap, and costs only about $3 in the UK (approximately Rs 192), and a quarter of that amount in Pakistan. “If you can save a life for approximately $3, then I believe that's worth doing,” Shakur told NPR.

The only question now, is how doctors can make the drug available to women in poor countries, in the remotest parts of the globe."
"NASA Is Working On A Plan To Prevent Supervolcano Eruption, Which Could've Devastated Our Climate","Scientists at NASA are working on plans and strategies to prevent the reputation of a supervolcano, that's believed to be residing underneath Yellowstone National Park.

Scientists believe that this eruption could have had devastated effects on our climate, which is why it was necessary to take certain measures. They think that by drilling hole in one of the most dangerous supervolcanoes, they will subdue the effects.

High-pressure water jets would be pumped into cool it down, releasing heat from the magma chamber and preventing it exploding, but everything needs to be done with a lot of safety. NASA plans to drill a hole 10km into Yellowstone and pump in water which would be slowly extracted.

The cost of the project is in the region of £2.69bn.

“If you drill into the top of the magma chamber and try and cool it from there, this would be very risky,” said Brian Wilcox of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology, reports BBC.

“This could make the cap over the magma chamber more brittle and prone to fracture. And you might trigger the release of harmful volatile gases in the magma at the top of the chamber which would otherwise not be released.”

He further claimed that supervolcano threat is bigger than the asteroid or comet threat. An eruption of this size could cause long-term effects on the planet, altering the climate conditions to a point of no return.

If such a condition arises, the world will sweep into a starvation epidemic, with food reserves only lasting just for 74 days.

Buoyant India aim to extend dominance

• Last updated on Wed, 23 Aug, 2017, 06:49 PM Gokul Gopal in Pallekele

Malinga's form hasn't helped Sri Lanka either. © AFP

The one-sided nature of the India-Sri Lanka contests, which resulted in the hosts being clean swept in the Test series, extended into the first ODI as Virat Kohli's side registered a record victory in Dambulla, chasing down 217 with more than 20 overs to spare. The stage now shifts to Pallekele, the same venue where India registered their first overseas Test whitewash, for the second and the third ODIs, and going by how the series has progressed so far another huge Indian victory would only be a fair prediction.

It wasn't that Sri Lanka did not show any fight in the first ODI. Just that they couldn't capitalise on a good start and threw their wickets away causing much anger among the fans who resorted to protesting and shouting slogans against the team soon after the game. At 139 for 1, Sri Lanka had reached a solid position before crashing to 216 all out. Four out of the top five managed to cross 30 but only Niroshan Dickwella managed a half-century while the rest failed to convert their promising starts. Their bowling too was no match for India's batting might as the visitors raced to the target, registering a nine wicket victory.

Shikhar Dhawan, who scored an unbeaten 132, summed it up by saying that Sri Lanka is a young side going through a transitional phase. However, this phase has been going on for a long time now and what isn't also helping the team is that the selectors are trigger-happy. ""For me, if we were left alone and you could work with this group of players, you could get some stability and consistency over a period of six months,"" said interim head coach Nic Pothas, urging the selectors to show some patience. But the lack of it has had a cascading effect on the team, whose performances only seems to be getting worse.

Batting, fielding, catching, bowling - nothing has gone right for the Sri Lankans in this series, with a fair share of injuries further depleting the resources. The hosts also haven't been helped by the fact that Lasith Malinga, their pace spearhead over the years, has been a pale shadow of his former self. Having not seen any ODI action since November 2015, Malinga returned to the squad for the ICC Champions Trophy. In the nine games that he has played since June 2017, Malinga has picked up seven wickets while going at close to six an over with a bowling average of 61.71. The 33-year-old might be on borrowed time and unless he can justify his place in the team, Sri Lanka might have to look at different options.

Meanwhile, everything has been rosy in the Indian camp ever since they set foot in Sri Lanka. One dominating performance after another, contributions coming in from all corners, emphasis on fitness and a proposed rotation policy keeping everyone on their toes, the Indian team is in a happy place at the moment. There are, however, a few concerns which might have been masked by their towering performance in the last game. The quick bowlers erred on either side of the wicket and were finding it difficult to hit the right lengths, thus contributing a major share of the 10 wides that were bowled in the first ODI. Bowling coach Bharat Arun stressed on the importance of assessing the conditions beforehand and adapting to it. Whether the practice sessions leading up to the game have given them a fair idea remains to be seen.

The other immediate issue that India needs to address is the running between the wickets. Rohit Sharma did not appear too agile in the first game and was involved in a few mix-ups with Dhawan. Clearer calling and better judgement are imperative and the onus is on Rohit as well as Dhawan to figure out what works for them best. These apart, India pretty much have covered all bases and will head into the game with their confidence meter running in surplus.

When: Sri Lanka vs India, 2nd ODI - Thursday, August 24 at 2:30 PM Local Time

Where: Pallekele International Cricket Stadium

What to expect: Totals in excess of 300 have been limited in Pallekele, only three in 18 completed matches here, as the pitch offers a good balance between bat and ball. The last time India played at this venue was in August 2012 when they defended a total of 294. It is expected to be cloudy for the entire duration of the game with a high of 30 degree Celsius.

Team news:

Sri Lanka: Thisara Perera, Lakshan Sandakan and Wanidu Hasaranga failed to impress in the last game and they are likely to be out of the eleven for the second ODI. Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara and Dushmantha Chameera are the ones likely to replace them.

Probable XI: Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Upul Tharanga (c), Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedara, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Dushmantha Chameera, Lasith Malinga, Vishwa Fernando

India: Unless the nature of the wicket forces a change in combination or a late injury, the visitors are likely to stick to the same eleven that took the field at Dambulla.

Probable XI: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (c), Lokesh Rahul, MS Dhoni (wk), Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal

Did you know?

- Rohit Sharma's last seven outings in ODIs in Sri Lanka read 5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 4 and 4. He is one single-figure dismissal away from breaking Sanath Jayasuriya's record of most such dismissals in succession.

- Chamara Kapugedara has scored 162 runs from his last 15 ODI innings at 11.57, with a highest of 62. The other 14 innings have fetched him a mere 100 runs.

- MS Dhoni is one short of equalling Kumar Sangakkara's world record of 99 stumpings in ODIs. Dhoni has so far affected 98 stumpings and has taken 278 catches behind the wickets.

What they said:

""In 2014, India were in the same situation when you got new players and new support staff. It takes time for everyone to get used to each other. I don't know what the time-frames are but all I know is that if we keep doing what we are doing at the moment you'll see results pretty soon"" - Nic Pothas, Sri Lanka coach, remains optimistic about his team's chances.

""If the wicket is similar to Dambulla I don't see any reason to change the team just after one game. It was a perfect game for us because we came back into the game beautifully, we did well with the bat and were really sharp in the field. Very happy with how it went in the first game"" - Virat Kohli, India captain, hints at an unchanged line-up.

Lamborghini's Ultra Luxury Android Smartphone Is Worth Far Less Than Its Rs 1.57 Lakh Price Tag,"There are a lot of people who prefer the iPhone for its UI, or its premium look and feel, but there are some for whom it’s just a status symbol. Buying expensive sub-Rs 1 lakh phones is one thing, but what do you call someone who buys a smartphone at the price of a small car?

Behold with thine eyes, the face of stupid purchases.

Insane. The word you’re looking for is insane. But, apparently, some brands don’t think the same way.

Lamborghini has just launched a premium Android smartphone they’re calling the Alpha-One. Billed as the “perfect fusion of Italian design and the most luxurious technology”, it’s an exercise in excess, except where it matters.

The smartphone features a 5.5-inch QHD (1440x2560) display with a 20MP rear camera and a 8MP front camera. It packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of RAM, and 64GB internal storage, expandable up to 128 GB. The device also has a fingerprint scanner, dual SIM support, and runs Android Nougat.

And that’s it...

Yes, for the same kind of hardware you could purchase at a significantly cheaper price, Lamborghini is selling the Alpha-One for $2,4,50 (approximately Rs 1,57,100). Pretty much all you’re paying for is the leather casing and the Lamborghini brand, stamped front and center at the bottom of the panel. But if you’re rich enough (and willing to throw your money away), the device is available starting today in the UK and UAE."
Supreme Court has done right to quash triple talaq,"The Supreme Court’s majority verdict declaring triple, or instant, talaq unconstitutional is an important, albeit limited, victory for Muslim women in India. It aligns India’s Muslim personal law, in this regard, with the law in most large Islamic nations that have already outlawed triple talaq, including Pakistan and Bangladesh. It opens the door for a serious engagement towards creating a civil legal code based on the principle of equality.

For women of Muslim faith in this country, the judgement marks a first important step. But there is still a long way to go. The judgement focused on a single issue, the triple instant talaq, or talaq-e-biddat, a frequent method of divorce among Sunni Muslims in India. It does not address issues like polygamy or nikah halala, or even the unilateral privileging of men in two other routes of divorce: talaq-e-ahsan and talaq-e-hasan. Personal laws of other religious communities, Hindus and Christians, have gone through renditions to address some concerns relating to gender equality in matters of inheritance and polygamy. Despite the gains, gender equality does not permeate all aspects of civil law. The triple talaq judgement presents an opportunity to initiate a debate on putting in place a uniform civil code that brings equality — across faiths and gender. The government should ask the Law Commission to review all personal/civil laws to ensure that these do not violate the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution. In doing so, care must be taken to strengthen democracy, rather than weaken it.

If any attempt to modify personal laws is seen not through the prism of gender equality and inter-community parity, but from a perspective of imposing the majority’s will over minorities, that would vitiate democracy. This depends not just on the modifications proposed in personal law but on the overall developments in the polity. Political parties would do well to not stoke sectarian passions in the name of personal laws. Ridding laws and practices of patriarchal privilege is not easy, but essential to move towards a more wholesome democracy."
Going to Gorakhpur’s root: Here are some simple steps that would turn around and restore vibrancy to government hospitals,"The Gorakhpur tragedy has exposed the weakness of the public health system. Instead of finding a scapegoat, let us look at how India’s broken public health system can be mended. There are three main problems with Indian public health, and none of them have to do with lack of money. The problems are (i) acute shortage of medical specialists; (ii) lack of career progression for nurses; and (iii) accountability.

Shortage of medical specialists is evident even in a state like Karnataka which has the largest number of medical colleges. Yet there are over 1,200 vacancies for specialists in government hospitals. Unlike in the past, an MBBS doctor with adequate training but without a post graduate degree is legally barred today from performing a caesarean section, an anaesthetic procedure, an ultrasound or interpreting a chest X-ray.

The top 10 causes of death in India cannot be treated by an MBBS doctor. In simple terms, even a brilliant MBBS doctor cannot do anything more legally than what a housewife is permitted to do. These rigid regulations were created by the Medical Council and upheld by the Supreme Court for patient safety.

Unfortunately, we also have an acute shortage of post graduate seats needed to convert existing two lakh MBBS doctors into specialists. Because of the shortage of specialists, Indian maternal and infant mortality rates are worse than some sub-Saharan African countries.

The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery recommends preparedness for “bellwether procedures”, ie emergency caesarean section, laparotomy and surgery for open fractures at community health centres – of which there are 5,500 in India – as an indicator of an efficient public health system. Today, 60% of deaths are due to non-infectious diseases. According to the commission, while only 3.83 million people die globally due to malaria, HIV and TB, 16.9 million people die due to lack of access to safe surgery every year.

India needs 65 million surgeries annually, but only 26 million are performed and the rest suffer and die. Legally, only specialists can perform surgeries and treat non-communicable diseases. This is the reason a hospital without adequate number of specialists is of no use for the patient and the community.

Ten years ago, maternal mortality rate (MMR) of Maharashtra was as bad as in the rest of the prosperous south Indian states. In 2009, Maharashtra’s health ministry recognised diplomas from the then 96-year-old College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS) to convert MBBS doctors into specialists. Today, nearly a thousand specialist medical officers working for Maharashtra health service are not MD or MS but diploma holders from CPS. By 2013, these diploma holders had produced a Maharashtra miracle: they dramatically reduced its MMR from 144 to 68, half of Karnataka’s MMR. Very soon, Maharashtra will be challenging Kerala for the number one spot.

Fortunately, the Union health ministry is considering recognising CPS diplomas across India. National Board of Examinations is also converting large government hospitals as teaching institutes to train medical specialists. With trained and certified gynaecologists, paediatricians, anaesthetists and radiologists, community health centres and taluka and district hospitals will become the most vibrant hospitals.

Second, the nursing profession is in crisis in India. In the US, 67% of anaesthesia procedures are administered by nurse anaesthetists. In India, a nurse who worked in an ICU for 20 years is legally not allowed to prescribe even a painkiller. The younger generation will never take up a profession where there is no career progression. Recently, the health ministry and Indian Nursing Council launched the nurse practitioner course, which will be a turning point in Indian nursing profession. Nurse practitioners can reduce doctors’ workload in government and private hospitals, improving clinical outcomes.

Third, the accountability question. People need hospitals only for the procedures. Health ministry should monitor hospitals on just four parameters for every government hospital – outpatient numbers, number of diagnostic tests, number and outcomes of surgeries and number and outcomes in critical care service. This data should be uploaded real time to a cloud-based app. Based on this data the ministry can grade every government hospital, plan budgetary allocation, increments and promotions of staff. Real time data in public domain will hold the mirror for policy makers to reflect on. We believe in god, but the rest is data.

When i was growing up, government hospitals were the most vibrant institutions and government doctors were our heroes. My brother, a doctor himself, insisted on my getting a tonsillectomy in a government hospital. If there were 20 full-time paediatricians working at Gorakhpur’s BRD hospital, tragedy would have been averted.

Medical specialists are always at the highest level of the government pecking order. Young and qualified medical specialists will insist on improvement of infrastructure to practice their newly acquired skill and build their reputation. As always happens in India, one of the 20 paediatricians would be taking care of a senior minister’s or politician’s grandchild, thus having access to the state’s power centre.

Maharashtra’s experience has convinced us to believe that recognition of CPS diploma courses across the country will be a turning point in the history of vibrancy of government hospitals, along with empowering nurses and digital accountability tools. I am convinced, after spending my entire professional life in managing hospitals, that private enterprise cannot replace government hospitals for rural healthcare. If you think government is not capable of managing hospitals look at Jayadeva Institute of Cardiac Sciences Bangalore, UN Mehta Heart Institute Ahmedabad and ILBS Delhi which make India proud."
This Lady Ran A Marathon In Sari To Promote Handloom And Encourage Women,"20,000 people ran the 42-km-long Hyderabad marathon on Sunday. They tried their best to finish the race. Most of them did and eventually grabbed the spotlight. But Jayanthi Sampath Kumar had drawn everyone's attention much before crossing the finish line. Only because she ran the marathon wearing a sari. And not just that, she also managed to cover the entire 42-km stretch.

Twitter

In an exclusive interview with Deccan Chronicle, Kumar spoke about her experience and said, “It was a great experience! And yes, many were curious. They wanted to take selfies with me.”

So who is Jayanthi Sampath Kumar after all? What is she up to? Why did she run in a sari?

“I want to promote handloom and encourage women. This is a statement of my support. I am a cyclist and ride very often, and notice a lot of plastic pollution happening around us. I am keen to curb that and want to use this platform to oppose it. For that, maybe I should run in a sari made of plastic wrappers people throw,” she said.

These Sportstars Are Also Popular For Making One Mistake That Changed Their Lives Forever,"You associate 100 hundreds with Sachin Tendulkar, two triple-hundreds with Virender Sehwag, 260 Premier League goals with Alan Shearer. Then there's Michael Jordan, who is generally regarded as the greatest basketball player on earth.

But there are some sportstars known for that one distinct moment and not for an otherwise illustrious record or achievements.

Allan Donald - 1999 World Cup Semi-Final Run Out

South Africa vs Australia. 1999 World Cup semi-final. South Africa were just a run away from reaching the final. Lance Klusener was on strike. And Donald was at the other end. Klusener pushed the ball down the ground and Donald was as good as stoned. The match was eventually tied and Australia scraped through for finishing higher on the Super Six table.

Jasprit Bumrah - 2017 Champions Trophy Final

Jasprit Bumrah had dismissed Fakhar Zaman for three in the final. The Pakistani batsman had edged the ball to keeper MS Dhoni. The umpire signaled a no-ball. And Zaman went on to make a century in the match. Even worse, India lost the match to Pakistan.

Chetan Sharma - Last ball Six During AustralAsia Cup final

Chetan Sharma wouldn't have seen this even in his worst dreams. It was the AustralAsia Cup final between India and Pakistan. Pakistan required four of the last delivery and Sharma ended up bowling a full toss to Javed Miandad. And what could have Miandad done? He swung it over the ropes for a six!

Herschelle Gibbs - Dropping Steve Waugh's Catch

South Africa again. But this time this wasn't Allan Donald. It was Herschelle Gibbs. After blasting his way to a 101 in the first innings, and then in the 31st over of Australian innings, dropped Steve Waugh at mid-wicket. It was out of sheer excitement that he dropped the ball soon after catching it. Yes, he'd dropped the world cup.

Beckham was the poster boy of English football. And this was the big stage. And his screwed it up by getting red-carded by the referee for fouling Diego Simeone in a harsh manner. Beckham's exit immediately put England on the backfoot as they were down to ten men. The match ended in a 2-2 draw and the Argentina won the match in penalties.

Diego Maradona - The Hand Of God - 1986 Football World Cup

Everyone knows about it. And you must have been wondering why wasn't this mentioned earlier in the list. Maradona became a controversial figure soon after this game. It was the quarter-final match against England, where Maradona jumped inside the box to head the ball in. But his hand touched the ball and the Argentine legend celebrated the most controversial goal in soccer history."
Privacy as fundamental right: Minding our business,"By Smriti Parsheera

The Supreme Court’s upcoming verdict on whether we have a fundamental right to privacy will be one of the most momentous decisions of our times. It is, however, inopportune that this vital issue has arisen as an offshoot to the Aadhaar litigation.

Both sides are alive to the fact that the decision will take them a step closer or further from proving their stance in the main petition. This has undeniably coloured the arguments in court. The real implications of the nine-judge decision will, however, run much deeper than the immediate questions of Aadhaar.

The term ‘privacy’, while not expressly spelt out under the Constitution, forms the crux of what it means to live a dignified life in a liberal democracy. The concept of a secret ballot, for instance, finds its origin in the need for ‘political privacy’, our ability to vote anonymously, without the promise of reward or fear of persecution. Section 94 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, codifies this right by providing that a person cannot be mandated to disclose for whom she has voted, not even before a court of law.

Then there’s ‘physical privacy’ that guards a person’s body and physical space from unwelcome intrusions. ‘Behavioural privacy’ gives us the freedom to keep private our religious practices, sexual orientation and associations. ‘Informational privacy’ deals with the expectation of privacy in the collection, storage and use of personally identifiable information. ‘Cognitive privacy’ calls for new thinking about the use of technologies that can decipher thoughts and brain activities.

Some of these rights are already covered by existing constitutional provisions, some have been protected under laws, while others are still waiting to be born. A legal right can, however, not be a substitute for a fundamental right. Legal rights can be conferred and withdrawn at will and their validity rests on conformity with the Constitution.

The declaration of privacy as a fundamental right will not imply that it will become an unassailable, paramount right, which can never be undone. The contours of privacy, and the limitations on its scope, will have to evolve through jurisprudence developed by the courts. Even until recently, when we believed privacy to be an integral part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21, the Supreme Court had pointed on several occasions that privacy is not an absolute right.

For instance, in Mr X vs Hospital Z ((1998) 8 SCC 296), while dealing with the right to confidentiality of an HIV patient, the court held that in case of a conflict between right to privacy and right to health of another, the latter prevails. In another case, ordering a person to undergo a medical examination was not regarded as being violative of the person’s right to privacy where the test was necessary to determine unsoundness of mind, a recognised ground for divorce. The person could still refuse the medical examination, allowing the court to draw an adverse inference (Sharda vs Dharmpal, AIR 2003 SC 3450).

Conferring privacy with the status of afundamental right will achieve two key goals. One, it will offer a guaranteed constitutional framework to test against ingressions into the various dimensions of privacy. Two, it will provide courts with greater confidence when comparing the tradeoffs between privacy and other constitutional protections.

The separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary demands that courts cannot question the wisdom of legislative actions. So, any law, no matter how odious it may appear, cannot be struck down by a court unless covered by certain specific grounds. These grounds, as stated most recently in the Aadhaar-PAN case (WP Civil No. 247 of 2017), are that the legislature did not have the competence to make the law; or the law is void for being in violation of any of the fundamental rights or any other constitutional provisions.

If privacy is not to be a fundamental right, what protection would we have against future transgressions of this right by various laws? Always having to derive this right from other provisions in the Constitution would dilute its efficacy. Relying on political processes to solve the issue would be too little, too late.

The key challenge, therefore, is not just about the privacy implications of the Aadhaar Act, or any other legislation, but the unforeseen laws and practices of the days to come. A few years ago, the Bombay High Court directed the UIDAI to share the biometric information of Aadhaar holders in Goa to aid the CBI in a rape investigation. The UIDAI challenged this before the court on grounds of privacy, which was accepted by the court.

The passage of the Aadhaar Act has now closed the door on such speculative searches, at least so far as biometric data is concerned. If the law were to be subsequently amended to allow biometric data to be shared for investigation and surveillance purposes, one would like to believe that the supporters of the Aadhaar architecture will join the detractors in opposing such a move. What we will need then is a fundamental right to privacy against which the actions of the legislature can be tested.

A Riot Of Vegetables,"The vibrant colours of vegetables bring out the artist in me. It makes me internally happy, French chef ALAIN PASSARD says to RANJENI A SINGH



Till the year 2000, he cooked meat. Then began his love affair with vegetables,thanks to the garden he created in 2001. Since then, French chef Alain Passard has been dishing out vegetarian fare, with each plate turning out as a piece de resistance. Just like an artist who contemplates his palette before he paints the first stroke on the canvas, Passard takes a long look at the colours of vegetables — “a mauve, yellow, a marbly white, celadon green, a pearly orange,” to quote him — for inspiration before getting into the technical aspects of cooking.And when he is not cooking, Passard is sculpting crabs and hedgehogs in bronze or making collages. The three Michelin star chef,known as the greatest vegetarian cook in the world,says,“When I saw the vegetables in the garden, I wanted to change professions, to renew my senses,change my hand. It wasn’t so much killing animals that made me change but the excitement of travelling on a different kind of fabric.”He says that nature,too,does not like the same routine — that is why she created seasons and seasonal vegetables to fire the imagination and you can,therefore,cook up something new every day. About his relationship with his garden, Passard says,“They definitely make me a better chef.



It’s made my cuisine better, and gives value to farmers, because a garden is a playground for culinary creation.”To not let refrigeration or any such thing meddle with the natural flavour of the vegetables, his lovingly tendered vegetables are transported from his garden — located in the Eure and the Sarthe regions of France — to his kitchen in Paris, in time to make meals. And when the vegetables of a particular season are over, the produce of the next season takes over. Such is his love for vegetables that his restaurant,Arpege, also sells organically grown vegetable baskets every morning.Six gardeners work at the vegetable garden in Fille sur Sarthe.Three people look after the vegetable garden in Bois-Giroult.The latest one,the garden of Porteaux, located opposite the Mont St Michel bay, has its own orchard. For the wellbeing of the gardens as well as the earth, there are two donkeys, two foals, as well as cows, chickens, and a goat that live there.Call it total communion with nature! Passard is proud of his prized possession: His vegetable garden. And he declares on his website,“I grow my own vegetables to be able to tell a story from the grain to the plate…and to be able to combine the chef ’s touch with that of the gardener,two passionate professions.Through these gardens, I have trusted nature with my creativity;it is nature that dictates my actions. The most beautiful cookery book was written by nature itself.”



The shift from meat to vegetables has changed his perspective.“Spiritually, it brought me a lot of happiness.I reconnected with painting thanks to the immeasurable amount of colours that vegetables can offer, and this gave me a completely new perspective on what being a chef means.It helped me realise that cooking vegetables was more artistic,” says Passard and adds, “I think it’s very personal. For me, there are different kinds of cooks: one that will nourish his inspiration through colours and seasons, the shapes and colours of vegetables, and one who doesn’t have that sensitivity and who will inevitably see his cuisine as a job, not as a passion, and a source of creativity.” He likes to listen to what is cooking, hearing the subtleness of the crackling,for he says, the sound of tomatoes cooking isn’t the same as the sound of beetroot cooking. “Taste is a combination of two or three flavours and it is linked to textures,and what gets on the plate is strong,yet delicate.” Does he agree with eastern wisdom that says,‘You are what you eat’? He prefers to change the maxim to ‘You eat what you want’.“That says even more about a person, because it is a personal choice. By eating what you want, you accept your tastes, and through the effort you put into it, you can know whether you like the art of the table or not,” says the chef. Is food all about cooking up a great dish and savouring it,or is it something more? “Of course! Cooking and savouring are decisive steps, but before they can even begin to exist, you have to think.Think about what it is you want, who you would like to share it with, what techniques and touches will you use? It all revolves around your senses, and they are moments you linger and long for,moments you cherish and that lead up to cooking, then serving. It’s such a sensitive space, so large....” And in this celebration of food, the family plays a key role. Passard believes that family meals are the richest of these moments.“You share dishes,ideas,a moment where you discuss your past,your future, because a family bond is timeless. It’s an opportunity to connect through classical dishes that everyone identifies with”. (Alain Passard interacted via email).

5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. 🌼 A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

Baby boy 👦💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It’s time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibe💤 A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you’re a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you’re not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime 💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."
"Mr Murthy, Walk away before you further destroy your reputation and debilitate Infosys","By Omkar Goswami

Dear Mr Murthy,

I have known and admired you for over two decades, been an independent director of Infosys for 15 years, and still serve as a board member of Infosys BPO. Unfortunately, I am obliged to write this formal and public letter to you.

Formal, because the events that have occurred involving you, your supporters and Infosys — starting from November 2016 and culminating in Vishal Sikka’s resignation on August 18 — need a formal response. And public, because it is no longer a private matter between you and the board of the company.

I, and each ex-independent director that I’ve known, held you in high regard when you invited us to join in your vision of reinventing India’s boardrooms and building a thriving institution that would survive us all. Today, each of us is deeply upset by your public conduct, and of your two ex-Infoscion supporters.

Your actions have de facto created a crisis that has forced the exit of a CEO, led to a stupendous 9.6 per cent drop in the share price, and a loss in market capitalisation of over Rs 22,600 crore in one trading day, and initiated the process of class-action suits in the US. Despite my friendship with you and the tradition that most directors strive to follow where board matters remain within the board, I have finally decided to come out in the open.

Let me broadly recapitulate the events. In October-November 2016, you and some other ex-directors of Infosys, including I, were disturbed by the board agreeing to a huge severance pay to its ex-CFO, Rajiv Bansal. This had never occurred before, not even to executive directors who left the company. You sent a letter to the Infosys board to that effect — one where I played a minor role in redrafting.

The board responded, admittedly belatedly, by freezing Bansal’s remuneration to what was actually paid out, which was 70 per cent less than what it had agreed to. It also asked David Kennedy, the legal counsel, to resign at his pre-contracted, pre-joining severance pay.

You also wanted the chairman and two other directors to quit, and the board to induct another independent director from your list. After discussions with you, the board appointed an ex-Infoscion, D N Prahlad. For the record, I sit with Prahlad on the Infosys BPO board and respect his fiduciary qualities.

It didn’t end there. Following a whistle-blower complaint in February, you started publicly pressurising the company’s board to conduct a legal-cumforensic investigation on the $200 million acquisition of the Israeli software firm, Panaya, and then to disclose the entire report on the company’s website. An investigation was done by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP, a reputed US law firm, for which you, too, were interviewed.

The Panaya report absolved the management of wrongdoings, and its basic conclusions were disseminated to the public. My first question: would you have posted the full report if you were running Infosys? You wouldn’t, as you didn’t in instances that needed detailed investigation.

You then wanted a co-chairman who met with your approval. Here, too, the board complied by elevating Ravi Venkatesan. By accommodating you, it created a fiduciary eccentricity of three different people at the top: a chair, a co-chair and a managing director and CEO.

Why did the board agree to so many of your demands, all played out in public fora? A generous interpretation is that it respected you and wanted to arrive at a middle ground. But it appears that you have not played your part, and have publicly leveraged your lionised position to constantly shift that middle ground for extracting more concessions.

Truth be told, the board was collectively timid. So, here’s my next question: if you were at the helm, and a person representing a small proportion of Infosys’ share capital did what you have done, how would you have reacted? You would have blasted him out of the water with no quarters given.

It didn’t end there. You and your two colleagues in this war complained about Sikka’s pay, though it was performance-linked and backloaded.

You praised U B Pravin Rao, but criticised his pay as well. The list is too long to accommodate here.

What does this mean for Infosys? The company was lagging behind industry when Vishal took over. It is now in the top quartile. Per-capita revenue has grown for six successive quarters. In an extremely difficult competitive milieu, Infosys had started increasing its margins while undertaking a profound change in business from leveraging labour costs to offering all-inclusive solutions to clients. Vishal’s task was far from complete when you entered the fray. And now, thanks to you, he is leaving.

How can Infosys strengthen employee morale under these circumstances? How can it find a worthwhile replacement for Vishal with you sniping at the wings?

How can it get away from this sapping, deleterious war that has got it lower valuation and titters from the competition? How can it focus on doing business if you are readying to rearm your weapons?

You will claim that it is all for corporate governance. But why don’t I, your corporate governance disciple, believe this any more? Nor does any other ex-independent director that I have spoken to, each of whom you respect.

Enough is enough. You have drawn first blood. Do not mortally wound the organisation by persisting in your actions. Let Infosys get on with its business, heal itself from the injuries that you have inflicted and again grow shareholder value. Learn to walk away, as you had promised when handing the reins to Vishal. The corporate governance halo that was conferred upon you is shrinking. Let it not disappear.

I have respected you more than many others in the corporate world. So, pardon me for this missive. How I wish it weren’t needed.

Omkar

Thinning of hair

Unlike the common loss of hair strands, you’ll find you hairline thinning and losing out hair in chunks. Some or the other part of your scalp will lose its hold on the hair and would start showing up. That’s your first signs."
