Ruthless England hand Windies a thrashing

Windies lost 19 wickets at Edgbaston on Saturday (August 19) in a horror display which allowed England to wrap up a three-day victory and take a 1-0 lead in the three-match rubber. It was about as poor a display of Test match batting as you could see from the tourists and their innings and 209-run defeat does not bode well for the competitiveness of the rest of the series.

A lack of basic discipline and patience, some might even say fight, resulted in a disproportionate number of poor shots from the Windies batsmen, eight of whom were dismissed twice in the day. On what was still a good pitch for batting, the visitors' capitulation, for that is what it was, within 93 overs across both innings should elicit plenty of stern words from coach Stuart Law. Despite their inexperience, this simply wasn't good enough.

It was England's third Test victory in a row, the first time since the summer of 2014 against India that they have won three successive matches. It will not, however, have told them much they didn't already know about their team and unless the Windies improve markedly in the next two Tests, England will have learned little ahead of the Ashes series.

James Anderson, who took four wickets in the day, was probably the pick of England's bowlers - it took the visitors 21 deliveries before they scored a run off him today - but Stuart Broad was equally impressive. When he dismissed Shane Dowrich in the final session, Broad overtook Sir Ian Botham to become England's second-highest Test wicket taker. At 31, there's plenty of time to add to his 384 victims.

Resuming on 44 for 1 this afternoon, the Windies lost the remaining nine wickets in their first innings for 124 runs to be bowled out for 168 just after the lunch interval. They were 346 runs behind England and with plenty of time left in the day, Joe Root enforced the follow-on perhaps more in hope than expectation of wrapping things up today. As it was, the visitors were bowled out for 137 second time round, losing six wickets for 61 runs after tea, and the win was sealed at 8.56 pm.

The day's rout had been started by Anderson, who dismissed Kyle Hope and Roston Chase without conceding a run and then ran out Keiran Powell by two yards from mid-off for good measure. The ball to dismiss Hope was a beauty, jumping from a good length to take the shoulder of the bat to Ben Stokes in the gully. The one to Chase was less spectacular but no-less effective as the batsman chopped a good length ball on to off-stump with an angled bat. Powell's attempted run was suicidal.

He was not the only batsman to be complicit in their own downfall. Shai Hope drove expansively and loosely at Roland-Jones and played on for 15 before Shane Dowrich swiped across a full delivery from the same bowler and was plumb LBW. Captain Jason Holder swished unconvincingly a number of times outside off-stump before finally edging Moeen Ali behind for 11. With his side in trouble, it was a poor show from the captain.

When all was going to pot around him, Jermaine Blackwood at least stood firm. He finished with 79 not out from just 76 balls and took full advantage of the width offered to him early on, in particular by Stokes. It was a fighting innings which included two sixes but the number six found little support. Broad bowled Kemar Roach and dismissed Alzzari Joseph LBW before Miguel Cummins was run out by Tom Westley as Blackwood tried to steal the strike. It rather summed up the tourists' innings.

It cannot have taken much time for Root to decide to enforce the follow-on given his bowlers had only got through 47 overs worth of work and the shambolic nature of the opposition's batting. Within five overs, Anderson had his 491st Test wicket when Powell played away from his body to a ball angled across him and edged to Alastair Cook at first slip.

Kyle Hope was next to go LBW to Roland-Jones and Shai Hope followed shortly after wafting at a rising delivery from Stokes and edging to Joe Root. They were two more poor shots to add to the list. Kraigg Brathwaite, the only front-line batsman not to be dismissed twice in the day, battled gamely for 40 before missing a turning ball from Moeen on the stroke of Tea which was given out LBW on review.

That left England with six wickets to get in the final session which they did in less than 20 overs. Blackwood was the first to go, stumped off Moeen, rather undoing his good work of the first innings, and Chase was LBW to Broad from a ball which kept low. Holder was dismissed next ball, caught at second slip, and although Roach kept out the hat-trick ball, England were not to be denied. The last three wickets fell soon enough, Broad finishing with 3 for 34, which put the Windes out of their misery and sent a raucous Edgbaston crowd home happy.

Brief scores: England 514/8 decl. (Alastair Cook 243, Joe Root 136; Roston Chase 4-113) beat Windies 168 (Jermaine Blackwood 79*; James Anderson 3-34) & 138 (f/o) (Kraigg Brathwaite 40; Stuart Broad 3-34) by an innings and 209 runs.

India should offer permanent residency to skilled foreign workers,"By Neeraj Kaushal

Steve Jobs, it is said, advised President Barack Obama that colleges in the US should staple green cards to the diplomas of graduating foreigners. Bill Gates made a similar recommendation in an article in The New York Times sometime back. Alas, President Donald Trump is unlikely to heed their advice. But the Indian government should.

India should offer permanent residency to skilled foreign workers and students graduating from Indian colleges. India is more deficient in skilled workers, relative to its needs, than almost any major country. The most recent Manpower Talent Shortage Survey reported that almost two-thirds of Indian employers surveyed experienced difficulties in finding workers with required skills.

Expat’s Got Talent

The only other country where employers reported greater difficulties in finding required skills was Japan whose working-age population has been shrinking for a quarter century. Meanwhile, India is awaiting a demographic dividend, which requires substantial investments in education and training.

Let immigration policy not be an obstacle in attracting talent. It is likely that the welcome mat to foreign students will not immediately attract many from East Asia, Southeast Asia or Latin America. Our neighbours —Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka —will be the most immediate source of talent. We should offer to give residency permits to graduating foreign students and skilled workers, including those from South Asia.

For security reasons, Pakistani students may have to be kept out. But we have the potential to make India a highly attractive place of learning and work to the most talented students from Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Initiatives to proactively recruit the best PhDs, Indian or foreign, in Indian universities would make them more attractive to foreign students.

We get a large number of African students, who prefer India to the US or Europe. They find Indian universities academically strong without being prohibitively expensive. But they face racism and discrimination simply account of the colour of their skin. The best of Africa are as good as the best of anywhere in the world. We have the potential to attract the best from Africa, train them for Indian needs, offer them permanent residency and a path to citizenship.

In western countries, a substantial proportion of scientists and skilled professionals are foreign-born. Switzerland tops the list with 57% of the scientists, working and studying, in the country being foreigners, according to the GlobSci Survey of 2011. The corresponding figure is 46% in Canada, 45% in Australia, 38% in the US, 33% in Britain, 23% in Germany, and 17% in France. The proportion of foreign scientists working or studying in India, in comparison, is negligible: less than 1%.

Critics would argue that liberal immigration of foreign talent would adversely affect Indian skilled workers. In 2000, similar sentiments sent domestic politics in Germany on fire with the ‘Kinder statt Inder’ (Children not Indians) slogan in response to the government’s policy to allow foreign-born computer specialists. Talent shortages continued, and five years later, the German government announced an even more liberal immigration policy.

Critics might also say that India has its own millions to educate. Why should it use its resources on foreigners? International scientists, professionals and entrepreneurs make the rich world rich. If India wants to get rich, it needs to create policies and build institutions that attract foreign talent to supplement its skill requirements. China also has its millions to educate. But it has recognised the importance of mobile foreign talent.

Going for the Skill

Its leaders openly acknowledge that the biggest obstacle to future growth in China is talent. For this reason, it has been aggressively wooing foreign talent and sending its own youth to acquire state-of-the art skills abroad. In 2008, the Chinese government announced the ‘thousand-talents’ programme.

Highly talented research scientists and entrepreneurs are lured to this programme from around the world. It has launched a China Green Card, a permit for permanent residency, for certain groups of skilled foreigners and Chinese expats in Shanghai and Beijing.

The contribution of foreigners in raising innovative potential and economic prosperity is most visible in the US, where one of every five doctors is foreign-born, as are two of every five medical scientists, one of every five computer specialists, one of every six persons in engineering or science occupations, one of every four astronomers, physicists, chemical and material scientists, and one of every six biological scientists.

Since 1990, academics associated with US institutions and universities have won close to 65% of all Nobel prizes in chemistry, medicine, economics and physics. But less than half of the recipients were born in the US. Many European countries have been trying, rather unsuccessfully, to compete with the US for foreign talent. This is an opportune moment for these countries to roll out the welcome mat to foreign talent.

Foreign students who feel harassed by the US Department of Homeland Security could move to other countries with more liberal immigration regimes. India should join the race and offer easy residency to skilled foreign workers and students graduating from Indian colleges.

Such a progressive, growth-oriented immigration policy goes well with the philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva kutumbakam’ (the world is one family) laid out in the Upanishads.

KL Rahul could be the answer to Team India’s long-term No.4 riddle,"By Chetan Narula

In the last season or so, India’s ODI record has wavered. They played just eight at home, all in preparation for the 2017 Champions Trophy, winning 5-3 against New Zealand and England. For what it’s worth, they did finish runners-up in the quadrennial event. And whatever plans the team management charted for that tournament worked — barring Pakistan in the final, of course.

Yet they have to redraw the plans for the 2019 ODI World Cup and the team management has identified the wobbly No 4 spot as the weakest link. And with two years remaining, now is a good time to start working on it. “KL Rahul will bat at No 4 in the ODI series against Sri Lanka. He is too good a player to be left out of the playing eleven at this time,” said coach MSK Prasad this past week.

Rahul has climbed the charts very quickly in the last year or so, and has gained immense confidence from the dressing room in his abilities across formats. As such there are two ways to look at Prasad’s comments.

One, the Indian team has decided upon its opening combination for the near future. Rohit Sharma is steadfast at one end, while Shikhar Dhawan — with three international hundreds (and another four half-centuries across formats) since June — has bought himself more time.

And it is the continued inclusion of Ajinkya Rahane that confirms Rahul’s future batting spot. The latter had missed out on the New Zealand series last October due to a hamstring injury, and scored only 24 runs in three matches as he opened against England early this year. He was then unfit for the 2017 IPL and missed the Champions Trophy, both due to a shoulder injury. This resulted in Rahane being chosen as the back-up opener for the Champions Trophy.

Prasad was clear that Rahane would not be a middle-order choice as Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik were picked. When Rahane opened in the Caribbean (as Rohit was rested), the debate was sealed — he is no longer seen as a No 4 option. Second, Rahane came into the ODI side as an opener and it was the same line of thought — that he was too good a player to be left out — by then-skipper MS Dhoni that saw him shunted up and down the batting order over the years. The result has been an unstable No 4.

There is no denying that Rahul has climbed the charts with great efficiency, and whilst doing so, has shown a sense of adventurism in his game. When he burst onto the scene in 2014-15, he was seen as a compact opener for Test cricket. Over the next year or so, he added various dimensions — mostly attacking stroke play — to his game. The result was easy to see in the 2016 IPL — he scored 397 runs in 12 innings at an average of 44.11 and a strike rate of 146.49.

The point is that he scored those runs batting in the middle-order and complementing the likes of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers. Rahul was afforded the opportunity to make his ODI debut thereafter and he scored 100*, 33 and 63* in his first three ODIs (albeit in Zimbabwe).

That was nearly 15 months ago, and much has changed since, including Rahul’s own improved ability to score runs.

There is no doubt that he merits a run in the ODI format and yet this move leaves room for doubt. Rahul moving down to No 4 will only be a repeat of the Rahane experiment.

It gives rise to further questions. How long will they persist with Rahul in the middle order if he is not successful? And what does this mean for Manish Pandey, who has been waiting for a way back into the ODI eleven since autumn last year?

It’s a coin toss for now. Heads, they win and Rahul solves India’s long-standing problems at the No 4 spot. Tails, they go back to the drawing board. At the least they have two years to figure it out."
Four Sanitation Workers Die After Inhaling Toxic Gas While Cleaning A Tank In South Delhi,"Four sanitation workers died while cleaning a septic tank in Ghittorni area of South Delhi. The toxic gas that was emanating from the tank is the cause behind their death.

“The tank was originally meant for rain water harvesting and was filled with dirt and sewage. Anil, Balwinder, Deepu, Swarn Singh and Jaspal Singh entered the tank one after the other. While Anil, Balwinder, Swarn and Deepu were declared brought dead, Jaspal was sent home after treatment”, reports India Today.

The workers arrived at the tank to clean it on July 15. Anil entered the tank but stopped responding. Balwinder, worrying about his co-worker went inside the tank and soon stopped answering to other's calls within a few minutes.

After five men went in one after the other and stopped responding, the sixth man stepped towards the tank. The gas coming out from the tank made him unconscious.

Soon, police rushed towards the spot with two fire engines. The bodies were pulled out during the day.

A case has been registered against the owner of the tank, JK Mehta under under Sections 304 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

"‘Last new antibiotic molecule was introduced in 1970’, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NAGPUR: Despite being in place for the last five years many states are yet to implement the national antibiotic policy which advices the judicious use of antibiotics by medical practitioners. This is inspite of the fact that the country has the highest drug resistance rate in the world.This information was given by Dr Abdul Ghafur, committee member for the national antibiotic policy, who is also a consultant for infectious diseases at Apollo Cancer Hospital in Chennai. He further said that for the implementation of the policy, the central government is launching a comprehensive surveillance system to monitor drug resistance. National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has been recently appointed as a nodal agency for the project.“Under the project, all the big hospitals generating data for drug resistance will be submitting the same to NCDC every month,” said Ghafur. He was present in the city to attend ‘ CIDSCON ’, the annual conference of National Clinical Infectious Diseases Society (CIDS). Dr V Ramasubramanian is the organizing chairman, while Dr Ashwini Tayade is the organizing secretary of the conference.Ghafur added, “To execute the project, government will need good manpower, a giant software system and thereby will need to spend a lot of money. My suggestion to the ministry is to ask all the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers ( NABH ) accredited hospitals, who are already supposed to generate this data, to mail it to NCDC. There are over 500 NABH accredited hospitals in India. It’s a better option than trying to find hospitals across the country who happen to generate this specific data.”Ramasubramanian said, “Drug resistance has reached such an extent that we are falling short of antibiotics to treat infection. Whenever new antibiotics come into the market, bacteria develop resistance to them within two or three years.”He added that since 1970, when a new antibiotic molecule was introduced, nothing new has been done.“Since then we are introducing only minor modifications of the existing molecule. The problem is that the drug manufacturers are not finding much profit in investing in antibiotics research. Antibiotics are used for infections which are for short term. If you have some heart problem, I will give you a medicine and it will continue for 30 years, if you have a psychiatric disease, your medication lasts for 20-30 years. While antibiotics, you take only for 10 days. Hence, the big companies are not doing much research in antibiotics.” he said.To deal with the situation in the best way, he said that they were looking at ways to use the currently available antibiotics in a better fashion. “Like how do we modify the doze or use different combinations of dosage,” he said."

Footballer Paulinho Gives His Driver Surprise Gift Before Joining Barcelona,"Paulinho just left a lasting impression in China before moving to Barcelona. He's just not a smooth midfielder, he's also a generous heart. Soon after bidding goodbye to his Chinese club Ghuangzhou Evergrande, he gifted his Mercedes Benz to his driver.

Twitter

It is after a two-year gap that Paulinho is moving back to Europe. Before Evergrande, the Brazilian was with Tottenham Hotspur and that's one stint he'd love to forget.

Before he left China, Paulinho gave his driver the keys to his Mercedes. Apparently he offered his shoes too, but the driver said he was ok. pic.twitter.com/Oxz3z0lUkI — Matthew Stanger (@MatthewStanger) August 17, 2017

He is moving to Barcelona for €40 million.

On this, Paulinho's Brazilian contemporary Neymar said, “He is reluctant to receive any money, instead, he loves giving. For example, he gave his pair of Beats headphones and [Mercedes-Benz] car to his driver. His gesture of goodwill is not determined by his high salary. There are tons of people who are richer than Paulinho, but few are as generous and broadminded as him.”"

26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you’ve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with “addiction of online binge watching”.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

giphy

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."
Can Yogi do more for electricity than gau raksha?,"Uttar Pradesh has long been one of the worst administered states. Children’s deaths in Gorakhpur recently hogged the headlines, but are hardly new. Ex-bureaucrat V Ramani has unearthed an RTI response showing that between January 1, 2009 and November 30, 2011, 31,791 children were admitted to the Gorakhpur hospital, and no less than 3,745 died, 1,311 of encephalitis. Half the qualified medical posts and 40% of nursing posts were vacant. Similar problems afflict every sector in UP.

Like many predecessors, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has promised to overhaul governance. During a recent visit to Lucknow, two senior bureaucrats told me the Yogi was more serious than any chief minister for decades, and was not simply a Hindutva fanatic. Yet UP’s history has long been one of broken promises and dismal outcomes. Poor governance is deeply embedded, and will resist overhaul.

There are some green shoots. One of the most difficult areas to reform in any state is electricity. Huge subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers have plunged most state electricity boards deep into the red. Chief ministers need to bite the bullet and push through major tariff hikes and reductions in theft.

The Yogi has bitten the bullet. The state has proposed tariff hikes of up to 360% for different categories of rural and urban domestic consumers, the average hike being 22.6%. Industry rates have not been raised at all — the state wants to attract industry, and its rates are already high. This is the very opposite of the populism typical of a new chief minister.

Can UP follow the Gujarat model? There, companies in generation, transmission and distribution all show profits. As Chief Minister, Modi cracked down on power theft, raised tariffs, metered and supplied power to almost all villages, and bifurcated electric feeders to villages. This enabled him to supply 24×7 power for domestic use and six hours per day for agricultural pumps.

Profitable industrial and commercial consumers account for 52% of consumption in Gujarat, against only 30% in UP, which cannot therefore depend on cross-subsidies from industry for farmers. It currently loses Rs 2.07 on every unit of power supplied. Apart from subsidies for rural and urban domestic consumers, power theft and corruption are rampant. The state’s Aggregate Commercial and Technical (ACT) losses average 31% across its distribution companies. The Yogi seeks to slash this to 23% in a year, a huge challenge.

Technical losses in transmission should not exceed 8-9% of supply. Anything more represents theft and corruption. ACT loss is a whopping 60% in Meerut, where politically powerful vote banks and industries have long siphoned off power in collusion with corrupt electricity officials.

Checking theft requires strong police support. But police stations in UP are under-staffed and fully occupied with major crimes and public order. They have no time or staff to check electricity theft: unfilled vacancies for constables exceed one lakh.

Yogi’s radical reform proposal is to create one new police station in every district dedicated to checking electricity theft. That can be a game changer. A senior official says, “This is the first government in my time to say we should go after all thieves without exceptions or mercy.” Brave words, but implementation has never been the state’s strong point.

Following court orders, exams are being held to hire one lakh constables. These will be based largely on objective questions in a written exam, not school marks, since cheating is so rampant that school marks mean nothing.

The state’s ‘Electricity For All’ scheme aims to electrify every household by October 2018. That means doubling the current number of connections: an additional 1.12 crore rural and 15 lakh urban consumers are to be covered. Up to 10 lakh diesel gensets of farmers will also be converted to electricity. The Yogi claims rural power supply is up from 12 to 18 hours per day. Grassroots reports suggest substantial improvement though not to the extent claimed. Critics, including buffalo traders and meat processors, say the Yogi is keener on cow protection than electricity.

Officials claim that in four months, the BJP government has metered 3.25 lakh unmetered connections, and provided 12.5 lakh new connections. They say in the April-June quarter, electricity supply rose 18% while revenue jumped 30%, reflecting better collection.

Will this be sustained? Will the BJP resist the temptation to waive rural electricity dues when the next election approaches? Is the Yogi serious enough, and bureaucracy honest and efficient enough, to stop power theft and collect bills? Let’s see. The Yogi’s power reforms have started well, but have miles to go."
"Nuclear medical generators stuck at airports, PMO concerned, Health News, ET HealthWorld","MUMBAI: Reacting to a TOI report on the scarcity of nuclear generators affecting diagnosis at the country’s leading hospitals, the prime minister’s office asked doctors from AIIMS , New Delhi, on Monday to brief its officials about the issue. Over 90 technetium-99m generators, which could have helped perform nearly 10,000 life-saving scans, have been languishing at Mumbai and New Delhi international airports since August 6 and are close to expiry.TOI had reported the previous Saturday how the generators with a maximum shelf life of 14 days are stuck at airports because one of the major importers could not complete the paperwork for a new licence in time. As a result, thousands of scans to be carried out at nuclear medicine centres for cancer, heart, renal diseases had to be cancelled.Dr Chetan Patel, who heads the nuclear cardiology unit at AIIMS, said the PMO has promised to look into the matter and expedite the process of getting approvals. “Currently, we have cut down the volume of tests by 40%,” he said. The hospital has approached the government’s Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology for the key radioactive material but is yet to receive supply.Currently, in most of the 200-odd nuclear medicine centres in the country, scans have either been completely stopped or drastically reduced. “The crisis will worsen as we have been told there will be no supply in the coming weeks,” said Dr B R Mittal, head of nuclear medicine, PGIMER Chandigarh, which normally performs at least 100 scans every day. “We are forced to turn away patients,” he added.While the generators have been coming to the country since the past 30 years, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) imposed quality control last October, making it mandatory for importers to obtain fresh licences. However, an order asking the customs to restrict their import has disrupted the supply of generators since one of the importers is yet to get the registration certificate. Drug Controller General of India Dr G N Singh had previously told TOI that importers were given five to six extensions since last year to complete the formalities.A bigger hazard looming now is that of radiation exposure at the two key airports. Even if the generators become useless for medical consumption, they cannot be discarded like regular medical waste. Hospitals store them for two to three months before they become non-radioactive and are safe to be discarded. “Since airports don’t have any such facility, there is a risk of radiation exposure, even if minimal,” said Dr Anshu Sharma, president, Society of Nuclear Medicine (India). “The Atomic Energy Regulation Board (AERB) has stringent regulations for discarding of radioactive materials. How will airports follow these regulations?” he said.Vishat Diagnostics, the largest importer of technetium-99m generators that supplies to 80% of the hospitals, said they won’t import generators till they get the registration certificate. Ajith Kumar from Vishat said, “We have incurred losses to the tune of Rs 15 lakh because of the government’s stance. We will not be importing any more generators till we have all the papers.”Meanwhile, patients have been badly hit. Patang Khandekar (65), who was asked to undergo a full-body scan, was turned back from a Marol hospital on Monday. “It is sad that we have wasted precious radioactive material that our nuclear reactors don’t manufacture,” said Dr G Mahapatra from SevenHills Hospital."

Here are the edited excerpts:The biopharmaceutical sector in India, comprising therapies, vaccines, diagnostics and devices, is currently valued at nearly $20 billion and accounts for the lion’s share of the $35 billion Indian BioEconomy. With the Indian BioEconomy projected to grow to $100 billion by 2025, the biopharma industry could grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 16% in the next eight years.Biocon has pioneered the biotechnology sector in India, starting off as an enzymes company in 1978 and then transitioning into a biopharmaceutical company in the early 2000s. We were the first biotech company of India to be publicly listed in 2004. We are also the first company globally to commercialize recombinant human insulin (rh-insulin) manufactured through Pichia fermentation technology. Today, we rank among the top 3 biosimilar players globally for insulins. We launched India's first indigenously produced novel monoclonal antibody for head and neck cancer, BIOMAb EGFR, in 2006 and the world's first novel anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb for chronic plaque psoriasis in 2013. When we introduced CANMAb in India in 2014, it was the first biosimilar Trastuzumab to be approved for sale anywhere in the world. Patients in India and several emerging markets are benefiting from our affordable novel biologics, generic insulins and biosimilar antibodies. Recently, the US FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended our biosimilar Trastuzumab for approval, which is a significant milestone as it paves the way for the final approval of this affordable cancer drug in the US. Biocon has not only put India on the global biotechnology map, we are today considered among the world-beating innovators in biopharmaceuticals.After dominating the traditional generic drugs industry for decades, many Indian companies are now in the race to create generic versions of biologic drugs or biosimilars, which are far more complex to make but offer a large global opportunity.Since 2008, the Indian biosimilar industry has been growing at a CAGR of 30%. There are around 25 Indian companies operating in the biosimilar space, marketing close to 50 products in the Indian market. Today, Indian patients have access to some of the biosimilars like Insulins, Insulin analogues, Filgrastim, Trastuzumab, Rituximab, Adalimumab etc. This early experience with developing biosimilars is paving the way for Indian players to capitalize on the unfolding global opportunity. The global biosimilars market in 2020 is projected to be between $25 billion and $35 billion.The biotech industry in India faces a gamut of challenges that include a time-consuming approval process, sub-optimal infrastructure, high regulatory barriers, lack of funding avenues, little or no incentives and a shortage of highly skilled talent, among others.Having said this, I would like to point out that the situation is improving. The government is synchronising its resources, plans, policies and priorities with a vision to enable a biotech industry that will create a $100 billion bio-economy by 2025.India in 2016 announced draft guidelines for ""similar biologics"" that will enable such drugs to be developed and brought to the market in an affordable and expeditious manner, whilst ensuring quality, safety and efficacy. The government's ‘Start-Up India’ initiative is creating an enabling ecosystem through a number of policies that include seed and venture funding to support biotech entrepreneurs, incubators and accelerators. India has also recently unveiled the National Biopharma Mission, which is an industry-academia collaborative mission for accelerating discovery and early development of biopharmaceuticals.Biocon is developing a portfolio of 10 biosimilars spanning insulins, monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant proteins that collectively target a global market opportunity of over $60 billion.As early movers in the biosimilars space, we have introduced some of our key biosimilars in several emerging markets and are now looking to take these high quality products to developed markets. Three of our advanced biosimilar assets, namely Trastuzumab, Pegfilgrastim and Insulin Glargine, are on track for anticipated regulatory approvals in developed markets. In 2016, a ready-to-use, disposable, prefilled Insulin Glargine pen developed at our devices facility in Bengaluru was launched in Japan, which is also the first biosimilar product from India. Our Malaysia insulins manufacturing facility, which is the largest in Asia and was built at an investment of over $250 million, started commercial supply of insulins this year. Moreover, our rh-insulin became Malaysia’s first locally manufactured biosimilar product to be sold in the Southeast Asian nation under a three-year, MYR 300 million ($70 million) Malaysian government contract.Recently, the unanimous recommendation to the US FDA for the approval of our biosimilar Trastuzumab by the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee endorsed the quality of our biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency in comparison to the reference product. Along with our partner, Mylan, we now look forward to engage with the US FDA to seek final approval for bringing this affordable biosimilar to patients of HER2-positive breast cancers in the US.In India, we have also received approval for our biosimilar Bevacizumab developed as an affordable alternative for patients suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer and lung cancer.We have been able to transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare to address critical unmet needs. We have built a very interesting pipeline and continue to invest in our actively progressing novel assets through ongoing clinical trials to address local as well as global unmet medical needs in the areas of diabetes, autoimmune/inflammation and oncology. So far, we have successfully taken seven biologics, novels and biosimilars, from ‘lab to market’ in India and continue to invest 12-15% of our revenue in R&D.Our insulin Tregopil, a ‘first-in-class’ oral prandial insulin under development, promises to transform diabetes management. In the autoimmune diseases space, our novel first-in-class anti-CD6 humanized monoclonal antibody ALZUMAb (Itolizumab) is widely accepted in India for treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. We are progressing a subcutaneous form of Itolizumab through key clinical studies for global markets. We are also pursuing the exciting space of siRNA-based (small interfering RNA) therapeutics in collaboration with Quark Pharma for a rare ophthalmology indication."

India willing to be bold through World Cup metamorphosis

'Experimenting' is a word that's being thrown around in Indian ODI cricket of late, with the focus on building a core group ahead of the World Cup in 2019. As part of the experiment, KL Rahul has been confirmed as India's latest No. 4 in the 50-over format, with the selectors of the opinion that he is ""too good a player"" to be left out. After being sidelined for the IPL, Champions Trophy and the series in the Caribbean, Rahul has returned to the Indian ODI side, having recently fared well in the Tests.

The number four hasn't been a permanent spot for a player from the Indian team in the last two years, with as many as nine having batted at that position since January 2015. Ajinkya Rahane, Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni, who've batted the most number of times at two-drop, have decent numbers. But the only remarkable performance came from Yuvraj's bat when he scored 150 against England in Cuttack in January this year, apart from Manish Pandey's unbeaten 104 against Australia in January 2016. However, Yuvraj failed to do justice to the spot in the innings to follow, which was also the case with Pandey, forcing the selectors to take a punt on Rahul.

Among the contenders in the current Indian team for the No. 4 spot are Rahane and Pandey, but the fact that they aren't guaranteed spots in the eleven, let alone the number 4, puts the spotlight on Rahul. Only an injury to one of the openers might prompt the Indian team management to elevate Rahul to the top of the order again, opening up spots in the middle order. But as of now, one middle-order position has been reserved for Rahul, as confirmed by the captain himself.

""We have players who have the ability to strike at 200, same players have the ability to play for 35 overs for you in a one-day game. It all depends on what you decide to do as a team and then move forward in that direction,"" Kohli said on the eve of the the opening ODI in Dambulla. And in Rahul, India appeared to have identified a batsman in the middle-order capable of seamlessly shifting gears between a consolidator and an aggressor.

Whether Rahul would get a long rope even if he fails in this series, remains to be seen. But it has left both Rahane and Pandey out of the current framework - a familiar situation for both as they'll again warm the benches and wait for a stamp of approval, unless the management deems an immediate change is necessary.

The series offers India a chance to experiment but it's the 'time-frame' and not the 'opposition' that will be the focus for Kohli and his team. One of those experiments is the current position offered to Rahul, assigning him a definite role to play. The other is the inclusion of a talented, but a relatively-new, spin attack which offers the exuberance of youth as against the experience of R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.

Having gone in with the traditional finger spinners for sometime now, there seems to be a shift in the thought process of the selectors and the team-management, who now perhaps think wrist spin is the way forward. Among the top-wicket taking spinners since 2015, the top-three are leg-break bowlers - Imran Tahir, Adil Rashid and Rashid Khan - while Ashwin barely makes it to the 10, and Jadeja much lower.

""If you give 30 in 10 overs and don't take wickets, last 10 overs that's going to be covered up,"" said Kohli, emphasizing that economy rates do not matter as much as wickets. In Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal, India have two quality options and variety, with the former's chinaman complementing the latter's leg-breaks. Even if Axar Patel's traditional left-arm spin is preferred, in a bid to hold one end up, India have at least one wrist spin bowler at the other end whose wicket-taking abilities would prove crucial.

For Kohli, it's the time-frame that matters and not the opposition when it comes to experimenting. Embracing new challenges with a view of the long-term goals of the team, the Indian captain is willing to risk losing a few matches along the way and accept the criticism that'll come with it.

""If you want to be world beaters and win everywhere in the world, you need to do certain things that are out of the box. So we're all ready to embrace that,"" said Kohli, not afraid to enforce changes. The next 12 months will be the time for certain experiments and how they turn out remains to be seen. But change seems to be the new mantra for the Indian ODI team.

Vaghela’s exit an opportunity for Cong to take a stand in Gujarat,"Shankarsinh Vaghela has quit the Congress party. As a Gujarati, I thank whatever gods may be. There is a larger point to be made and I’ll come to that in a bit.

Vaghela was a dedicated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man who should never have been made head of the Gujarat Congress in the first instance. Hindutva has brutalised the state and permanently divided its people and ghettoised its minorities (an act of extreme anti-nationalism).

Congress should have stepped in to recover the truth in Gujarat’s culture of pacifism and mercantilism and pragmatism and progress. Instead, in appointing the Hindutvawadi Vaghela, the party continued the political lie that Hindus and Muslims are permanently at war and communal politics is inevitable. Rubbish.

There are those who say that with Vaghela’s exit the Congress will lose the assembly elections coming in that state in the next six months.

However, it should be pointed out to such geniuses that in his 20 years (he joined hands with the Congress in 1997) the party anyway saw defeat in every single assembly and Lok Sabha election. What great victories was this compromise with first principles bringing the Congress? Not one.

For my parents in Surat, all these years, the option inside the polling booth was always between endorsing an RSS Congress leader or an RSS BJP leader. That’s not really a choice.

If the Congress says it stands for Nehruvian secularism, then the first place that must show is in the people who speak for it and the second in what they say. The same rule applies to my friend Sanjay Nirupam, who heads the Congress in Mumbai. A pleasant fellow but a former Shiv Sainik. I believe in redemption and the idea of reformation, but such people as Vaghela and Nirupam, who jump from leadership position to leadership position without demonstrating their devotion to first principles are unfit.

To the larger point now. What will the 2019 general election be fought on? Given the damage Hindutva is doing to India and Indians, it is clear that it must be fought on an uncompromising anti-Hindutva platform. This should be accompanied by specific things, like the opposition to genius strokes like demonetisation. But the underlying narrative must be carried on the back of an Indian inclusivism that is natural to us and that we can see all around us.

The fact is that the image of India that Hindutva’s supporters hold is not apparent. We are a unified culture being deliberately and mischievously divided. How tough can it then be for the Congress to sell reality? My slogan: ‘Indians are one people. Stop dividing us through Hindutva’.

My colleague Salil Shetty has observed that we are living in a time of democratic authoritarianism, when the sort of mischief that only dictators pursued is today practised by elected despots.

His other observation is that among such ‘strongmen’ type leaders, there are those who use violent and unhinged language, like the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and American president Donald Trump. And then there are people like Narendra Modi who speak softly but who have others do the speaking for them.

VP Singh said that to know what Hindutva stood for, do not listen to its leaders, but the people below. The poison that is being spread by Hindutva cannot be gleaned from the Prime Minister’s Twitter feed.

It can be understood by what is being done under him. Gujarat has already passed a law punishing cattle slaughter with life imprisonment, while Chhattisgarh’s CM has pushed for the death penalty. Modi’s criticism of vigilantes should start with attacking or sacking his party’s leaders who encourage the lynchings. But he won’t and that is the plan.

I am told often that many Indians conflate Hindutva with Hinduism. That is dangerous nonsense. Hindutva, a word of recent coinage, is a set of three specific political demands.

First, Musims must surrender their mosque (‘Ram Janmabhoomi’). Second, Muslims must surrender their personal law (‘Uniform Civil Code’). Third, Muslims must surrender their constitutional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir (‘Article 370’).

After taking power, a fourth political demand has been pushed: Muslims must surrender their dietary habits (‘cattle slaughter ban’). Hindutva is negative, sullen, passive-aggressive (observe the joyless faces of those who peddle it).

What links any of its demands with Hinduism the faith? Not a thing. It is anti-India in the worst way possible: it pushes an idiot nationalism that is ranged not at some enemy but against other Indians. Because of this, in my opinion, it borders on treason. It has to be resisted. Civil society will do what it can but the domain of this resistance is primarily politics.

The saying goes: if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything. For two decades the Congress has fallen for soft communalism in Gujarat. The opportunity has come for it to stand."

Hare Krishna!,"RADHANATH SWAMI helps us understand how Krishna can appear within us once we purify ourselves with sadhana



Krishna was born on Janmashtami day. It is also the day when he appeared in this world. As everyone knows, God is not born.He is beginning-less and endless but just as the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening,he appears to our vision at a certain time and that is called his birth. He then disappears from our vision which is called his disappearance.In fact, Krishna is the shining light of mercy. You all know that Devaki and Vasudev were married by an arrangement of Garga Muni and after the wedding ceremony, King Kamsa brought his sister Devaki to Vasudev’s kingdom. The demigods were anxious that Krishna should arrive soon on earth. So they spoke and their voice reverberated in the sky, “You (Kamsa) are a fool; the eighth son of your sister, Devaki, will kill you.” Kamsa,a demon,had conquered the whole universe. On hearing from the demigods that the eighth son of Devaki would kill him,Kamsa was afraid for his life and he thought, what is the use of conquering the whole universe if he was not able to enjoy it,as he would get killed by Devaki’s eighth son. He then became ready to kill his own sister and grabbed her by the hair and drew his sword to sever her head,but Vasudev intervened and requested him to spare Devaki,saying,Kamsa had a threat from Devaki’s eighth son, and not Devaki herself. Vasudev promised Kamsa, saying, “You have nothing to fear from your sister Devaki; it is her sons. I promise you, I will bring you each and every one of those sons and you can do as you like with them”. The first son born to Devaki and Vasudev was Kirtiman.Kamsa thought when the child was brought to him: I have nothing to worry for this first son, it is the eighth.“So you take this son back,”he told Vasudev.Then Kamsa returned to his ministers and friends who were all terribly materialistic and demoniac. Somehow,they convinced him that ‘any of these sons can be the cause of great trouble’. Narada Muni,in order to speed up the appearance of Krishna on earth, also added a few words of encouragement to Kamsa. So Kamsa called Vasudev and Devaki back and killed the first son ruthlessly and then put them in prison. During the next year, the second son was born and Kamsa killed him, too, and then the third son. One by one, he killed the first six children of Devaki. Now, there are many ways of perceiving what we are meant to learn through the killing of these six children. But we have to search deeply in the Bhagavatam and in the commentaries of great souls to understand what this means. So, after these six children were killed by Kamsa, Balarama appeared within the womb of Devaki.He was sent there to prepare the way for Krishna. Balarama’s job was to make that womb a very comfortable place for Krishna to appear. Balarama is the original guru. The spiritual master,who is God’s representative; he teaches us how to kill the six enemies — lust, anger, envy, pride, greed and illusion — but even after they have been extinguished in our hearts, we still require the help of a spiritual master to prepare our mind and our consciousness in such a way that it is a pleasing place for Krishna to appear. So Balarama prepared Devaki’s womb and then he was transferred to the womb of Rohini,who was actually his eternal mother and then Krishna appeared within the womb of Devaki. When he appeared, Devaki became effulgent; so beautiful, in fact, that the entire prison cell lit up with her aura. Devaki herself became the embodiment of such beauty that Kamsa and everyone knew in their hearts that now, Vishnu had appeared. They were simply waiting for the moment when they will have to meet face-to-face with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Janmashtami means not just the historial,astrological time when Krishna appeared in this world,but it means to us that we should understand the process by which Krishna can appear in our own lives. For that to happen, we must purify our hearts. Unless our hearts are pure, we cannot understand Krishna’s appearance and his activities and we cannot be free from suffering.We can take to a religion, we can affiliate with a particular congregation, we can perform many rituals, but ultimately, we must purify our hearts and that is the whole purpose of the association of devotees. It is actually the only purpose — of taking to a process of religion or performing any ritual or doing any sadhana in order to become pure.



Greater Strength



We should not think that religion is simply meant to live a better life in this world; in fact you will get that if you live religiously. But whatever nice arrangements you make in this world will culminate in death,old age,disease; you cannot avoid it. Real religion is to reawaken our eternal consciousness and that comes through purification of the mind and heart and through unalloyed, motivated devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Krishna cannot be impressed by what we can do,how much money we can give,how many austerities we perform, how many days we can fast,how many hours we can stand on the tips of our toes,whether we can stand on our heads, how wonderfully we can chant mantras or memorise scriptures.We do all these things not to gain recognition, but to become purified from within. When we are purified, when we develop humility and sincerity, this is what real religion means.Krishna is only attracted to purity,humility and sincerity. So that is why Srila Prabhupada, Iskcon’s founder, insisted — as all the great acharyas also insisted — that one must follow four regulative principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat eating. Because, when we are doing our sadhana, we are being purified. If you engage in these activities, you will further pollute yourself.We want to overcome these enemies; we do not want to give them strength.Every time you give in to meaningless rituals, you are giving the enemies within your mind, greater strength and longevity, and they will overcome you. Ultimately, Krishna killed Kamsa. He appeared in this world, directly, in his original personal transcendental form,5,000 years ago through his wonderful pastimes which are revealed in the Srimad Bhagvatam and the Puranas, through his teachings of Bhagwad Gita, through his holy names: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,Krishna Krishna,Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

5 Simple Ways To Help You Get Exactly What You Want In Bed,"It’s the weekend and you’re in the mood for some steamy sensual sex with your dream man or woman. The only problem is that as much you want things to come spontaneously rarely does your partner tune into your desires from the word go; especially if you guys are in the initial phases courtship.

universityprimetime.com

Phrases like “can you go down on me” or “can you squeeze me here” are often at the tips of your lips but seem so hard to let out—disrupting that mind-blowing sex you so desire. Here are some ways your work around some of the most common reasons that might be blockading your path to fulfilling sex.

#1. Make sure you know what you want

Some of you may realise and some may not, but if you’re not sure what turns you on under the sheets either you’ll be making the wrong request or end up never knowing what really excites you.

lmt-lss.com

What to do: Get curious about what you prefer by exploring your body by yourself. During your next sexual encounter try and figure out what feels or what you think feels more pleasurable by experimenting without holding back.

#2. Communication is the key even in the bedroom

The fact that you might upset your partner may be at the back of your mind but if you don’t communicate what you prefer in bed, how do you expect your partner to know?

medicalpress.es

What to do: Start with small compliments like “ I love it when you touch me there” in a sweet and straightforward tone and see how your partner responds. There’s more likelihood of you getting a better response so you can ask for bigger requests.

#3. Be his/her guide while you’re in the act

Some of us have our fantasies, fetishes, likes and dislikes well scripted in our mind. Use this information to your advantage by showing your partner what you like.

Don't Miss 4.4 K SHARES 6.5 K SHARES 5.7 K SHARES 1.8 K SHARES 935 SHARES 410 SHARES 253 SHARES 256 SHARES 3.2 K SHARES 550 SHARES

sexlovepizza.com

What to do: If you know that you like being touched in a certain area for instance either spell it out or guide his/her hand to area or spot you want to caress. Tell your partner what you want while you’re doing so to make your request even more specific.

#4. Use sensual video footage or erotica’s to build arousal

This is ideal for people who are not fans of physically or mentally expressing their desires since arousal starts in your brain anyway.

luaquebrada24x7.blogspot.in

What to do: Have your partner read an erotic scene from a movie/book or role-playing a character from a bondage, dominance, submission and masochism film (if you're kinky in the head) might be just what you need to spice things up.

#5. Never fake it if you want pleasure in the long run

You’ve been faking an orgasm because you feel the need to please or not to hurt your partner somehow. Unfortunately, this may only get your partner to think that he or she has figured the secret code out and it may be hard to change correctly that behaviour.

femeia.ro

What to do: Be honest and first be frank about the fact that you faked it because you were too embarrassed to share your what you originally felt and then state what you really are into. If you don’t want to mention the fact that you’ve been faking it you can try and squeeze in the fact that you would like to explore and experiment with new techniques. That should set the ball rolling."
"Merck CEO quits Trump panel: Far-right clashes: Merck CEO quits Trump panel, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Kenneth Frazier the Chairman and CEO of pharmaceutical company Merck & Co (AP photo)

CHARLOTTESVILLE: US President Donald Trump faced renewed pressure on Monday to respond more forcefully to a violent white-nationalist rally in Virginia, after drawing a storm of criticism when he avoided explicit condemnation of far-right groups.In a strong rebuke to the president, the CEO of one of the world's largest pharmaceutical firms resigned from a business panel led by Trump. Merck & Co Inc CEO Kenneth Frazier cited a need for leadership countering bigotry .The president has been assailed by Republicans and Democrats alike over his handling of Saturday's violence in Charlottesville, in which a woman was killed when a man drove his car into a group of counter-protesters. James Alex Fields Jr, the driver, was denied bond on Monday .Trump met top law enforcement officials at the White House to discuss the issue.Critics said Trump waited too long to address the violence, and slammed him for stating when he did that “many sides“ were involved, rather than explicitly condemning white-supremacist marchers.Merck's Frazier, who is black, did not name Trump or criticise him directly in a statement posted on the drug company's Twitter account, but the rebuke was implicit. “America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy , which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,“ he said.Trump immediately hit back, but made no reference to Frazier's comments on values, instead revisiting a longstanding gripe about expensive medicines. “Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!“ Trump said in a Twitter post.In his comments on Saturday, Trump denounced what he called “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.“Authorities said Heyer, 32, was killed when Fields' car slammed into a crowd of antiracism activists confronting neo-Nazis and KKK sympathisers, capping a day of bloody street brawls between the two sides in the Virginia town.Attorney General Jeff Sessions tried to defend the president in TV interviews on Monday in which he stressed the administration was taking a robust approach to investigations.The attack on counterprotesters “does meet the definition of domestic terrorism,“ Sessions said."
"Knee surgery: After cardiac stents, government now caps knee implants price, cuts prices by up to 69%, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: After coronary stents, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has wielded its powers of price control on knee implants — devices used to replace parts of the knee joints that are damaged. The difference this time is that the regulator has exercised its own emergency powers to do so, instead of waiting for the government to bring the devices under the National List of Essential Medicines as it did on stents.The drug pricing watchdog slashed the prices of total knee replacement systems and their individual components by as much as 69%, an NPPA notification issued on Wednesday evening showed.This decision is expected to lead to a saving of Rs 1,500 crore per year for the people of India, union minister for chemicals and fertilizers Ananth Kumar said. According to him, 1-1.5 lakh orthopaedic knee procedures are done in India annually.Industry bodies representing manufacturers said they were reviewing the order and would take their suggestions to the regulator for its effective implementation.The price of total knee implants made of cobalt chromium has now been capped at Rs 54,720, down 65% from its average maximum retail price of Rs 1.58 lakh, data from the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers showed. These are the most widely used complete knee implants, it said.Total knee implants made of special metals like titanium and oxidized zirconium can be priced at a maximum of Rs 76,600, or 69% lower than the original average MRP. High-flexibility implants have also seen a similar reduction in the maximum price to Rs 56,490. Revision implants, used in repeat procedures when the initial knee implant has failed, is capped 59% lower at Rs 1.14 lakh, down from an average of Rs 2.77 lakh.Special knee implants for cancer or tumours will follow the prices of revision knee implants, NPPA said.These prices are exclusive of goods and services tax, but take trade margins for manufacturers or importers, distributors and hospitals into account, NPPA said.The regulator's latest order specifically highlights the ceiling prices of each component used in a knee replacement procedure, such as femoral, tibial, insert and patellas. In most cases, the ceiling prices of these components have been set according to the materials used, but in the case of certain components, these have been fixed regardless of the materials used.NPPA's order comes around six months after it slashed the prices of coronary stents by up to 85%.Unlike stents, the government did not put knee implants on the essential medicines list. Usually, the Department of Pharmaceuticals notifies products for price control and NPPA caps the prices after the health ministry puts it on this list.Out of 1.5-2 crore patients who require arthroplasty interventions, only around a lakh are in a position to pay for the procedure every year, NPPA stated. Citing a World Health Organization bulletin from 2003, it said osteoarthritis could become the fourth leading cause of disability by 2020. India is likely to be one of the leading countries of such immobilized citizens in terms of numbers.""As the public is aware, prices remain too high for devices across the board. We would like this to be the start for NPPA to systematically fix prices of all other devices on which data was collected in public interest,"" said Malini Aisola of patient group All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN). ""The price reductions still need study and it will not be successful without a check on the hospital rates,"" she added.According to some knee implant manufacturers, the order has left a lot of issues unresolved without which the price cuts might not be possible. One of the companies that ET spoke to said a knee implant device has a number of components, and without fixing the prices of those components, it would be difficult to gauge the price cut.The Association of Indian Medical Devices Industry (AiMeD) is expected to meet the drug regulator asking for time in implementing these price cuts. The Medical Technology Association of India, another body that represents knee implant makers like Johnson & Johnson, Stryker, Zimmer Biomet and Smith & Nephew, said it is currently reviewing the order and will respond with suggestions to NPPA to ensure practicality of its decision.“Prices are reasonable and we are with the government. We believe this price cap will help every person of the country who needs implants,” stated Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator, AiMeD."

It has always made its presence felt in top ranks with some of the best value-for-money offerings. However, from time to time one needs to keep growing its product portfolio and HP has done just that this year, at least in India.After expanding its Omen range of gaming laptops and PCs in the country, the US-based PC-maker recently refreshed its 'Pavillion' laptop series with the x360 hybrid-laptop. You'll have to shell out Rs 40,290 for its base model (11-inch screen variant). The most powerful variant goes for Rs 80,000 and upwards. With the Pavilion x360, HP aims to bring a powerful yet good looking computing machine, rounding off the hybrid-laptop as a complete package.We assessed the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX), which is priced at Rs 72,290 and have loads to talk about its performance and design. Curious if it comes with all the hallmarks of an all-in-one laptop? The review below might help you contemplate the decision.HP, since last year, started focussing more towards the design of its laptops and hybrid laptops rather than concentrating only on the performance. While its high-end 'Spectre' range was already visually appealing, a major shift in the overall laptop design strategy across other sub-brands was seen ever since the launch of the HP Spectre, which still remains one of the thinnest laptop ever.The Pavilion x360 plays on the same idea and brings a spin of ""premiumness"" with it. The 2-in-1 laptop looks elegant as it is complimented by a brushed metal look from all sides. The HP logo comes with a mix of mirror finish and so do the laptop hinges, all of which look decent when teamed up in a single package. Although negligible, the power button on the side and the rim enclosing the touchpad also sport the same shiny metallic look.The backlit keyboard adopts the same brushed metal appearance, making the design profile stable across the board. The speaker grille is placed above the keyboard layout. Although we'll talk about the audio quality later, what may bother few users is the placement of the speaker itself. Given the 2-in-1 design of the laptop, the dual speakers, while using the x360 in certain modes, throw the sound in completely opposite direction. For instance, when using in the tent mode you'll notice the speaker facing outwards, which is not much appreciated.The laptop is neither extremely slim, nor is it extremely light-weight. It is thick but not like your regular laptops. The device weighs 1.32 kg, which is considerably low as compared to some chunky workstations out there.HP has made sure that its Pavilion x360 doesn't excise on anything when it comes to connectivity. Majority of the left side of the Pavilion x360 is taken by the exhaust grille along with the power button on the corner, 3.5mm headphone slot and volume controllers. On the right, there is a charging slot, two USB 3.0 slots, a mini HDMI slot, a USB 2.0 Type-C slot and a card reader, all of which are used on a daily basis.Coming to the screen, the review unit we received (HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX) sported a 14-inch display with support for touch for easy use. The resolution carried here is 1080x1920 pixels (full HD), which in our opinion is decent enough for a 14-incher. QHD displays do add to the clarity and soar the pixel density, but for an everyday user full HD seems appropriate.At any point in time you can switch from traditional typing to touch screen without even folding the 2-in-1 to activate the tablet mode. Like we've seen with almost all the Windows 10 hybrid laptops, the Pavilion x360 too automatically changes the layout of the apps and the home screen as soon as it crosses the 180-degree folding angle.The usual options to tweak the brightness and dimness of the screen, activating Bluelight filter, changing fonts, text sizes, screen resolution and screen orientation are present. In the tablet mode, the screen auto rotates based on how you are holding the device, something which is common with nearly all the hybrid laptops. Watching movies and TV shows online was a delight. Watching 4K videos on the full HD screen won't make a difference in your viewing experience.The HP Pavilion x360 unit we received is one of the high-end variants in the series. Other variants come with different processor, RAM and screen size combinations. Our unit, the one which runs quad-core Intel Core i5 - 7200U ('Kaby Lake' 7th generation) processor, slid across apps like a hot knife on butter, giving zero lags at any given point of time. The processing power is complemented with 8GB RAM, which is once again, pretty decent for everyday use. With 1TB hard drive, you can store a bunch of TV shows and movies as well.Playing games, editing documents, videos and images were smooth and so was browsing through social media apps like Facebook, Messenger, Mails and more, courtesy Intel HD Graphics 620 and Nvidia GeForce 940MX GPU with dedicated 2GB DDR3 memory.Changing the laptop mode to tablet mode is also swift. Like it's the case with almost all hybrid laptops, you can use the Pavilion x360 in Stand Mode, Tent Mode, Tablet Mode and the usual Laptop mode. Binge watching movies and TV shows are something you will appreciate on the Pavilion x360 as the full HD display works in tandem with Bang & Olufsen-tuned speakers. However, the screen is reflective more than usual, so using it with artificial lights around could prove to be a hassle.The laptop scores 4250 on PC Mark and P8 194 on 3D Mark, both of which are pretty decent given the latest processor, 8GB RAM and the Nvidia-powered GPU.The device's user experience comes festooned with Windows 10 Home which is fast and comes with usual set of features, including Cortana. Some pre-installed apps however, can spoil the essence of an impressive user experience. HP Pavilion x360, above and beyond Windows 10, packs bloatware with some unwanted apps such as Agoda.com, WildTangent Games app, Minecraft and Solitaire. There are some HP-made apps as well like HP AudioSwitch, HP Orbit, HP Pen Control.Talking about the HP Pen Control, the laptop comes with a stylus. The stylus definitely bumps up the productivity of a user but is not as fluid as you would expect. The HP Pen Control app you can assign different actions to the stylus' two buttons. You would also have to change the single-cell AAAA battery that goes inside the stylus.As for the apps and services, HP Pavilion x360n also includes MS Office Home & Student 2016 Lifetime full version worth Rs 5999.You won't face any heating issues with the Pavilion x360 no matter you run 4K videos, play games, stream content online or perform all these actions while keeping the hybrid laptop plugged into a charging point.Video chatting is nothing but smooth sailing with the Pavilion x360. The images clicked by the webcam are in HD resolution and the videos shoot in the same resolution at 30 frames per second, something that makes it just enough to make the cut when it comes video calling.The history of battery performance with hybrid laptops have been pretty average and somewhat consistent since last couple of years. Most of them work for a few hours, given the heavy processing of apps. With the HP Pavilion x360 the case is slightly unusual. The laptop, as HP says, has a 'liberating' battery life as it can run for up to 9 hours and 15 minutes on a single charge. However, this is in ideal conditions. In our day-to-day usage, the device ran for around 7 hours before giving up.Heavy usage, which includes streaming videos, playing 4K movies and playing heavy games may result in even quicker drainage of battery.The HP Pavilion x360 certainly raises the level of game every other PC maker is playing when it comes to mid-range laptops in India. The sub-brand, which once was known for offering mid-range laptops, although is moving towards more premium price bracket, it still takes some cues from other sub-brands as well such as the Spectre in terms of design and HP Envy in terms of performance.The device is an amalgamation of one of the best processors along with impressive speakers, decent screen, an average battery life, all encapsulated in a good-looking design. There are no such features that are either egregious or garish with the Pavilion x360.At Rs 72,290, the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX) is neither for heavy gaming nor for hardcore tasks. Instead, this hybrid laptop is something which could prove to be a hit not only with multimedia consumers but with young generation graphic designers as well who don't want their laptops to be extremely high-end ones with beefy innards and chunky look. They want a well performing laptop that looks good and can also be used casually. And HP seems to have hit that very nerve with the Pavilion x360."

"Unit Tariff: Solar tariffs at Rs 3 a unit may be the new normal: NTPC CMD Gurdeep Singh, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: NTPC chairman Gurdeep Singh said Rs 3-3.20 a unit tariff for solar power may be the new normal and can be achieved without the support of “cheap funds or cheap panels"", which have been a concern for the industry.Solar and wind energy units generate less than 10% of the global electricity output and have remained on the side-lines historically as these projects were taken up to fulfill a social responsibility towards clean energy But these green energy sources have seen a decline in prices making them comparable to conventional energy and causing a disruption in the power sector. India too has rapidly scaled up its renewable energy capacity , led by solar power in the last few years. But the steep fall in tariff has triggered concerns over project viability.“We should be happy with lower solar bids, especially when the process is done in such a transparent manner. In the current environment, solar power tariff would be Rs 3-3.20 a unit without relying on cheap funds or compromising on quality,"" Singh said.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on energy gave critical feedback on the solar energy sector, asking the government to help developers raise funds but has also raised concerns over the viability of these projects given the steep fall in tariff as a result of aggressive bids by developers.The solar power tariff plummeted to its lowest level in May at Rs 2.44 per unit energy in the auction for 500 megawatt (mw) of projects in Rajasthan. The tariff was about Rs 11 seven years ago.While Singh did not comment on the viability of project that are offering solar power at Rs 2.44, he said solar energy would play an important role in incremental capacity addition in the country but coal based-power would continue to be necessary to ensure cheap and continuous power supply to consumers.“We are aligning our business such that our incremental capacity is more in renewable and less in coal. We are quite confident of adding 25 gigawatts for renewable energy,“ Singh said.NTPC has commissioned 847 MW or renewable energy capacity , has 73 MW under execution and another 1,275 MW under tendering process. The company's target is to develop 10 GW of renewable energy as a commitment to the government. It is also developing another 15 GW under National Solar Mission (Phase 2).NTPC is the only power generator investing in conventional energy and its orders are being chased by power equipment majors like BHEL and L&T."
GOD’S OWN CITY,"As GUSTASP and JEROO IRANI stroll along Mathura’s alleys and ghats, they sway to the bhajans in a collective tide of devotion as they hail Krishna on his birthday



The man with a flowing grey beard was the third person to suggest that we remove our glasses as we ambled down the narrow street that led to the river ghats of the holy city of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh.Our curiosity was peaked.“Monkeys.They are chashma chor — spectacle stealing thieves,” he explained.The troop that patrolled this stretch of waterway had figured out that humans were willing to trade food for their stolen glasses...cell phones,purses, wallets and whatever else they could get their grubby hands on.Then smiling, he added:“You can’t blame them: Krishna was a makhan chor,the one who steals butter.He even made off with the clothes of gopis while they were bathing in the river.” We realised that Mathura revolved around Krishna.Like the time we came across a group of women attired in vividly coloured ghagra-cholis at the Gita Temple.Two young ladies broke free of the group, crossed the threshold of the rust-red temple and started to dance.They swayed to the rhythm of the silent music that stirred within their inner being. Then they stopped as suddenly as they had started.The ritual over, they ran to rejoin their companions who took turns to bend over and press their feet. Our driver-guide said that the two women probably saw themselves as gopis dancing as Krishna played the flute.Suddenly it fell into place: Mathura was a living tradition whose origins went back to the mythological time when Krishna, author of the Bhagwad Gita,grew up in the region. Born here under compelling circumstances, the child who would later drive Arjuna’s chariot in the Mahabharata wars, delighted in teasing the gopis who only seemed to love him all the more for his antics.



In Mathura,all roads eventually lead to the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple complex that commemorates the place where Krishna was born.Security police, armed with metal detectors, checked everyone — holy men, devotees and tourists — entering the complex. The reason for the high security was apparent: for beyond the soaring temple spires,the dome of the city’s Jami Masjid,built in 1661 by Abd-un-Nabir Khan,was clearly visible.The two shrines share a common compound wall. The central hub of the Janmbhoomi complex, however, was an unpretentious structure,quite unlike any temple building, where Krishna was born. A narrow tunnel-like passageway led to the central altar where the incarnation of Vishnu entered the world in miraculous circumstances.The story oft retold is that when the evil king Kansa learned that one of his Prime Minister’s offspring would eventually destroy him, he imprisoned the man and his wife.Over the years, as each child was born to the couple, the king entered their prison cell and killed it.



Standing in front of the altar,we felt the anguish of the parents with the loss of each child. And just when the pain seemed unbearable, the script was drastically altered for the birth of the eighth child.The heavens applauded his arrival with lightning and thunder;the chains that bound his father fell off, prison gates flew open and the guards fell into a deep stupor.The terrified father grabbed the opportunity to save his baby.Taking the infant in his arms, he walked past the sleeping guards, out of the palace complex and swam across the River Yamuna to neighbouring Vrindavan, where he swapped his son for a daughter born that very moment to one of his kin. Retracing his steps, he returned to the prison cell when suddenly the chains clamped back on him, the doors closed and the guards awoke. The next morning,the king entered to slay the newborn child,but even as he lifted it to slam it on the floor, it slipped from his grasp and soared up to the heavens.The king knew that the gods had conspired against him. In a desperate bid to stay the inevitable, he deputed a rakshas to masquerade as a woman and kill all newborn males in the kingdom by getting them to suckle at his poisoned milk breasts.The scheme came to naught when baby Krishna attached his mouth to the demon and sucked the life out of his body. The playful young lad grew up and eventually fulfilled his destiny by slaying the evil king.His mission complete, he went down to the banks of the Yamuna and rested at what is today known as Vishram Ghat.And that was where we were headed. We descended a flight of steps that led to the water and climbed into a canopied boat for a fascinating 15- minute cruise down the river.The liquid avenue fielded the reflections of the buildings — temples, shrines, a mosque, ancient havelis... that lined its banks. Back on the ghats, we joined the swell of pilgrims to take part in the evening river aarti.



As the sun set, five young priests stepped up onto a marble platform facing the river.At a given signal, they set fire to the multiple wicks of their many-layered oil lamps. Bells tolled as the priests launched into a choreographed fire dance,swirling the flaming lamps to the rhythm of bhajans. We rode the tide of collective devotion that surged across the river like a tidal wave before surging up to the heavens. By sundown,the temple deities had retired for the night so that they could rise fresh the following morning and shower blessings on their devotees with rejuvenated vigour.We too were up early to catch the first ray of the sun as it hit the steps that rose out of the river. Our final darshan was at Dwarikadhish Mandir, on a narrow street behind the ghats.The temple, built in 1815 by Seth Gokuldas Parikh,treasurer of the state of Gwalior, is dedicated to Krishna.We entered the temple minutes before the main deity was to be unveiled.The place was brimming with devotees. Competing bhajans wove into each other to create a rich tapestry of music. The din rose to a crescendo as the minute hand on the clock edged towards the appointed time.Seconds before the fateful moment,a hush fell over the gathering.The next moment,a pujari drew aside the curtain in front of the main deity.The lord was welcomed with a cry of devotion that exploded like a thunderclap of unadulterated admiration. We added our voice to the chorus that soared up to the heavens in prayer.We emerged from the crowded temple onto the streets of a city awash with the aroma of deep-fried savouries. It was going to be a perfect day.

Shikhar Dhawan's Blitzkrieg Propels India To First Win Of The ODI Series Against Sri Lanka,"Shikhar Dhawan is currently walking the best patch of his cricketing career. After a phenomenal Test stint against Sri Lanka, he has now roared against them in the ODIs as well. As Sri Lanka posted a paltry target of 217 runs, India were poised to win the match. But Dhawan made it look all-the-more easy.

Twitter

He blasted the Sri Lankan bowling and made his fastest century in the ODI format. He scored 132 runs off 90 deliveries. His 100 came up in just 71 deliveries.

Twitter

He also became the fastest centurion from India on Sri Lankan soil.

"Varian Medical Systems: Today we need to build trust that comes through transparency and credibility in engagement with patients: Ashok Kakkar, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Co-chair, FICCI Health Services Community andManaging Director,, Mumbai, talks about the highlight of FICCI HEAL Conference 2017 and shares his views on the recent healthcare amendments. Edited excerpts:If you look at the Indian healthcare scenario today, there are some excellent examples of patient centricity and excellence in care. Today India ranks almost at par with Western models when it comes to quality healthcare at affordable cost. Yet we also hear almost on a daily basis that today the Indian healthcare scenario lacks trust and the way the patients and the general consumers perceive especially the private healthcare with lot of suspicion. So I think, first and foremost what the sector needs to do and what the Indian hospitals need to do, is to build trust which comes through transparency and credibility in their engagement with their patients. The second piece, which again is corollary to the first one is how does hospitals today empower patients, whether it is through technology or otherwise and make them participate in the decision-making in the health decision-making and not treat it as a transaction or an episodial situation when a patient comes to the hospital he is discharged and then, you know, it’s all done with. It’s very important to ensure that the followships-survivorships are closely linked and patient remains in the center of the decision-making.FICCI is an excellent platform for exchange of ideas, where thought leaders both from public as well as private sectors engage and work towards betterment of the industry, and in this case in Healthcare sector. FICCI has very actively worked on issues of industry, working with the government whether it was related to taxation, custom duties, penetration of healthcare insurance in this country, and now we will look at the scenario around price-controls or standard treatment guidelines, public-private partnerships. So there are bunch of areas where FICCI has, and the teams, and the taskforces which FICCI creates, so that to ensure that there is inclusive approach in working on these subjects.I believe GST is good for the country, as well as for the healthcare sector, because it rationalizes and simplifies the environment. Having said that, and given the fact that healthcare services are exempt from GST, but, there could be an increase in input costs because lot of things that the hospitals buy, whether its medical equipment or other infrastructure, the impact of GST could be different, for example medical equipment especially capital equipment because of GST there is an increase in the custom-duty by two-two and a half points, so those will lead to increase in input costs for the hospitals. And given that, they cannot use this to set off, because there is no on-the-end GST, it make some increase in the cost but I think overall hospitals will have to find ways to be more productive and I don’t foresee that it would increase patient cost or the patient treatment channel.The pricing policy unfortunately has added a lot of confusion in this sector, while the intent may be good on part of the government to ensure that the patients are not exploited, because there have been cases around that. But what is very important is, for all the stakeholders again, government as well as the hospital providers to keep the entire care continuum and the costs around the care continuum in mind because it’s not just the device cost which is important, one has to look at the entire treatment, at what cost it can be delivered, say Angioplasty, at what price the Angioplasty gets delivered in the end to the patient is critical, is not just the cost of the stent for instant and I think, the government should've engaged the private sectors and the medical technology companies and the hospital providers in a manner that ultimately the patient would benefit, which unfortunately has not happened and that's where the confusion is.I believe there is a huge opportunity around public-private participation and the good news is that the government at the center is supporting it. The NITI Aayog had already been tasked to build models and NITI Aayog very actively has sought inputs from FICCI as an industry forum, they have invited even World Bank to help them build those models. We have done lot of PPPs in U.K and other parts of the world so we are helping t he government to create models which can then be adopted by the state governments. So that there is template available, and no one has to reinvent the wheel as far as PPPs are concerned because PPPs in healthcare can be very complex, and it’s important that in the end we build a model which is win-win and in the interest of patients at the large.When we talk about public-private participation or even private - private participation, example especially in the oncology space of private - private participation given the space in oncology is a little difficult the incubation is very long it requires a lot of regulatory approvals from AERB and so on. You will find some of the oncology chains in India going and setting up Oncology departments in existing hospitals. For instance, DMC in Ludhiana is a very good hospital run for several years doing excellent patient care but they had no oncology department so they invited a group called CTSI, Cancer Treatment Services International who run hospitals in Hyderabad to come and setup the Onco department and run it, so this is also a public private-private participation, it's not a public-private so we see these kind of models especially in oncology getting stronger there are companies like CTSI, Healthcare global, International Oncology, many of them who specialized in oncology. I see it’s a good step because building a hospital is not easy.Traditionally in India, it has been a doctor and his son and they will setup or a wife, to setup a hospital, but then it would normally be a one hospital phenomenon they would provide good service but they would not be able to expand because it requires huge amount of capital. So given now all the groups are coming in big corporates like this Apollo, Fortis, Max and they are expanding private equity funding which is coming in. CTSI got funded through TPG capital for instance so that gives them the breath and the muscle to then expand and reach out even to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where there is a dearth of a good hospitals."

As much as the craze for Game of Thrones is building up like crazy, people are getting impatient to know what happens in the next episode. Waiting for one week seems too long and that is perhaps, one of the reasons why one after the other, episodes of season 7 have been leaking like wildfire. The sixth episode was aired on TV “by mistake” and it is said that the seventh has also been leaked.

Twitter

Now, it is said that hacked have warned HBO that they will leak the finale episode as well, and much ahead of its air date.

Furthermore, it is said that the group is the same one which earlier had claimed that it has hacked 1.5 terabytes of HBO’s data that included Game of Thrones. They claimed that they have login credentials of HBO’s social media accounts.

Well, if that's the case then this is going to cause a lot of damage!

"Unhappy With Ministers' Lavish Lifestyle, PM Modi Tells Them To Avoid 5-Star Hotels & PSU Perks","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cautioned his ministers against staying in five-star hotels and availing of any benefit from public sector undertakings attached to their ministries, including using their cars.

BCCL

Shortly after a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, PM Modi is understood to have said that he was extremely unhappy with the recent tendency of some ministers' preference to stay in five-star hotels instead of accommodation that the government provides.

The PM made it clear to the ministers that they should stick to government accommodation while on official duty and not give into the ""temptation"" of staying in five star hotels, sources said.

He also told his ministers that he was unhappy with reports of some of them using vehicles from public sector undertakings under their ministries. The PM made it clear that he would not tolerate any misuse of vehicles of PSUs, either by ministers or their families.

Representational Image

PM Modi is learnt to have minced few words as he expressed concern over the signs that some ministers may have begun to use the perks of office. This has created a commotion with several ministers instructing their staff to ensure that no vehicles from PSUs are included for personal use. The ministers have also asked their personal staff to ensure that no ""perks"" from PSUs are entertained for personal use.

The PM is learnt to have made it clear that he will brook no compromise with his 'zero tolerance to corruption' stance. With two years to go for the 2019 general elections, the PM should be keen to ensure to maintain the ""scam-free"" image of the government.

"BRD ex-principal's wife under lens, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Lucknow: The UP government has initiated a probe into the bribery charges against the wife of suspended principal of Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College in Gorakhpur where 30 kids died amid disruption of oxygen supply. Among the allegations being probed is that Purnima Shukla, wife of the suspended principal Dr R K Mishra, took 10-12% commission in oxygen procurement.

According to a government notification of August 13, a copy of which is with TOI, a three-member committee of Ayush department will probe four serious charges against Mishra’s wife. Shukla, who served as homeopathic doctor at Gola block of Gorakhpur district, was removed from her position on Friday. The notification says Shukla held an additional charge of clinical trial unit of Central Council for Research in Homeopathy.

Sources in Ayush department told TOI that charges regarding anomalies in procurement of liquid oxygen from Pushpa Sales as well as oxygen cylinders from three suppliers — Modi Gas, Imperial Gas and Mayur Gas — will also be probed.

The notification also says that charges of Shukla’s interference in postings, transfers, appointment of staff and procurement of equipment will also be probed. Besides, charges of harassment of staff at BRD will be looked into, the note says.

The charges come at a time when 14 doctors at BRD hospital are already under scrutiny for allegedly running private clinics either within the college campus or outside. Sources in both BRD College and UP government said allegations of diversion of oxygen cylinders from the hospital to private clinics will be probed as well. Each cylinder costs Rs 233-270."

"Gulf project awards slumped in H1 but will pick up: MEED study, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","By Andrew Torchia

DUBAI: Contracts awarded to build economic projects in the Gulf's rich Arab oil exporting states slumped in the first half of this year but are expected to pick up in the second half, a data service tracking the industry said on Saturday.

Awards in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council dropped to $56.1 billion in the January-June period from $69.3 billion a year earlier, according to MEED Projects. Low oil prices have forced governments in the region into tough austerity policies.

With the exception of Saudi Arabia, where contract awards rose 12 percent from a year ago to $15.8 billion as the government showed signs of spending a little more freely with a modest improvement in its budget position, awards fell in every GCC state.

Kuwait saw a 46 percent drop to $6.9 billion and awards in Bahrain plunged 84 percent to $917 million. Even Dubai experienced a slight fall, MEED said; awards in the United Arab Emirates dropped 13 percent to $21.3 billion.

However, MEED forecast $61 billion of project awards in the GCC during the second half of this year, bringing the total for 2017 to about $117 billion, roughly the same as in 2016.

""There's no doubt that the past two years have been tough for the projects supply chain as government spending has slowed,"" said Ed James, director of content and analysis at MEED Projects.

""But with construction companies now more efficient, the private sector more active and the number of public-private partnership projects growing by the week, there is cause for optimism.""

This year's total is expected to be boosted by Oman, where the venture planning a 230,000 barrel of oil per day refinery at Duqm said in early August that it was likely to award over $5 billion of engineering, procurement and construction contracts to Petrofac , Samsung Engineering , Technicas Reunidas , Daewoo Engineering and Construction and Saipem .

In Saudi Arabia, sources told Reuters this week that the government was preparing to restart work on projects that are important to its drive to boost Islamic tourism, including expansion of the Grand Mosque in Mecca and a $3.5 billion hotel complex in that city.

James said there were over $2 trillion of known, active projects in the pipeline across the GCC.

""The majority of these are infrastructure schemes that are essential to the future prosperity of the region, job creation and economic diversification,"" he said.

""While inevitably not all will come to fruition, we can be confident that there is still a large amount of work to come regardless of the oil price."""
मृत्यु से पहले और दाह संस्कार के समय शव का सिर किस दिशा की ओर होना चाहिए?,
The Congress’s idea of India exposed,"Ashish Kulkarni, an aide to Rahul Gandhi and one of his election managers resigned recently. In his resignation letter, he cited the reasons: The Congress party was seen to be siding with the separatists in Jammu and Kashmir; the party was veering to the far left; it was also perceived to be anti-Hindu; the party catered to outright nepotism and was seen as elitist; finally, there was too much minority appeasement.

In a few short perceptive statements he managed to grasp what Lutyen’s Delhi has not been able to and why Digvijay Singh, Mani Shankar Aiyar and others of the Congress old guard are completely out of touch with India. It is not about nationalism or being Hindu, it is as Jay Panda, very rightfully pointed out at a roundtable discussion, that for decades India has not been governed according to our Constitution.

Every Indian under the constitution is considered equal. There must be a Uniform Civil Code for all Indians. These two mandated guarantees were largely ignored for vote banks and today, Indians are questioning it. That is why Triple Talaq, Love Jihad, Haj subsidies and other such issues are coming out in the open now. Muslim women themselves are demanding that the question of divorce cannot be left to arbitrary Mullahs, where men are allowed to abandon their wives at will. Why should a secular Republic be dictated by rules that are not only archaic but a form of appeasement to minorities?

India at 70 has to move on and by moving on we not only need to give opportunities to each and every young person but we also need to recognize the rights of women under a universal law.

For too long India has been living under the guise of a repressive tolerance. Left leaning socialism with its License Raj where companies could only produce so many cars or so many tons of steel led to massive corruption, high prices and a closed economy. It is a shame that we let go our basic manufacturing industries of electronics to China and helped them become a super power while our population remained poor, jobless and hungry.

It is horrendous that we let the separatists in Kashmir dictate to us how much money they wanted for peace in the valley all the while taking money from Pakistan for disturbing the peace. For decades, the central government was actually conniving, condoning and paying for terror in the valley along with, it seems, Pakistan! For years our police force and army sacrificed their lives for keeping the peace, while the local politicians in Kashmir and Hurriyat leaders were paid off to keep the valley simmering and the youth inflamed.

Recently, Zaroor Ahmed Watali a billionaire businessman, and close aide to Geelani, was found with secret diaries that revealed his ties with Pakistan’s ISI and funding to terrorists. The fact that since 1990 he has been using his businesses as a front for managing funds for the separatists for financing subversive activities in the valley and was arrested in 1990 and imprisoned but then let go, speaks volumes about politicians in Kashmir who grew rich on the blood of its people.

For 27 years Watali was allowed to finance terror in the valley and his businesses flourished in UAE , Europe, Mumbai and Kashmir thanks to political patronage and terror financing. The National Investigative Agency (NAI) is finally closing in on the separatists but we need to go after the politicians who allowed this kind of treason to flourish.

Ashish Kulkarni, has done us a big favour by pointing out that the Congress extended too many favours to the separatists. It is time we found out why?"

"Chandigarh CREST society resumes installing solar power plants, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Chandigarh: After UT electricity department started giving gross-meter connections, Chandigarh Renewal Energy, Science and Technology Promotion Society ( CREST ) has started the process of installing solar power plants.CREST is going to install rooftop solar power plants (SPV) of total capacity of 2350 kilowatt peak (kWp) at two different locations. The society intends to install an SPV of 1250 kWp at Sector 32 water works at estimated cost of Rs 7.82 crore, while 1100 kWp plant will be installed at Sector 37 water works at a cost of Rs 6.91 crore. CREST has already floated tenders for hiring a firm for installing the solar power plant.Earlier, UT electricity department had taken a stand not to issue no-objection certificates (NOC) for gross-meter solar power connections and was at the logger heads with the CREST over the issue. The department had also turned down around 15 applications moved by residents for installing solar-power plants of capacity between 300 and 500 kilowatt on gross metering.The stand-off between electricity department and CREST has delayed solar projects of around 6 megawatt capacity. It was only after UT adviser Parimal Rai intervened, the power department resumed giving the connections.Net metering is an agreement that allows a consumer to sell excess solar energy to the utility, while in gross metering total solar power generated is exported to grid.Chandigarh has been selected by the central government to be developed as a ‘model solar city’ and has set an ambitious target of generating 50MW of solar energy -both residential and government- by 2022.CREST is struggling due to shortage of space in the city, which is spread in an area of just 114sqkm. The society has done well by installing solar plants in 159 government buildings. The response from private sectors has not been impressive so far despite various initiatives taken by the administration.On a request by CREST, JERC enhanced cumulative capacity to 50% of the distribution capacity of a transformer, which was earlier restricted to 30%. Last year, CREST had also framed building bylaws making installation of solar power plant on new private buildings mandatory.In the past three years, CREST has generated 20.36 million units (MU), equivalent to reduction of 1,410 metric tonne of CO2 and planting a total of 15.3 lakh trees. Of 20.36 MU, bulk of power has been produced by plants on government buildings."

A final version is expected soon.Tentatively named the "" Prevention of Cut Practices in Healthcare Services Act, 2017"", the legislation is being framed to clamp down on unnecessary referral of patients by a doctor, hospital or a diagnostic centre. A doctor or medical institution will face an inquiry by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) if a complaint is lodged against them under section 3 of the law that defines the offences of ""cut practice"".The ACB is expected to check the veracity of the complaint and complete the investigation within three months. It can seek additional time of three months. A provision of fining bogus complainants has been made. After a probe, the ACB will file a complaint before the sessions court, which will try the case under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Till the inquiry is complete, anyone trying to malign the reputation of the doctor or the healthcare service provider shall be liable to one month's jail (see box).The draft rules also call for simultaneous action from the respective medical council under which the doctor or the hospital is registered. ""If a medical professional or a hospital is found guilty, the council shall take cognizance of such offence and initiate an inquiry into the case within six months of the receipt of the FIR,"" it says. It should take appropriate legal action and may also suspend the guilty for at least three months.Former DGP Praveen Dixit , who is heading the nine-member committee, said the draft will take into account public opinion.

StarSewer Story: Death Of Sanitation Workers In Delhi Exposes The Hypocrisy & Failure Of Govt,"Every day hundreds of men descend into the putrid, foul smelling gutters of the national capital without any safety gear. The number is staggering for the rest of the country. Those who die during the duty are replaced by others, waiting to put their lives in danger just to earn a living for themselves and their families.

Every week young men line up for Rs 200 that they get to clean 20-25 gutters. They do this each day of a week, till they fall sick due to poisonous gasses in sewers or die of asphyxiation.

While sewage cleaning has become mechanised in some parts of the country, the government figures suggest nearly 8,00,000 people still work as sewage cleaners.

In Delhi, sewage travels across 5,600- kilometre long sewer lines at the speed of one metre per second. There are more than 1.5 lakh manholes for the effluents released by the Capital’s close to 19 million people.

Reports suggest that nearly 23,000 men and women die in India every year doing various kinds of sanitation work.

A research at Tata Institute of Social Sciences has found that 80% of the sewage cleaners die before age 60 because of work-related health problems. In Mumbai, an average of 20 sewer workers die each month from accidents, suffocation or exposure to toxic gases, the study found.

Recent spate of deaths in the capital

Rajesh, one of the survivors of the Lajpat Nagar sewage cleaning fiasco, which turned fatal for three, is left with severe injuries and is jobless for the last 10 days after he descended into a sewer and fell unconscious, only to be pulled up the last member after he stopped responding.

bccl

Hailing from Uttar Pradesh, he has a wife and an 18-year-old daughter to look after. Rajesh, with his family, is currently in hiding. He has been constantly receiving death threats from the members of his community who question his survival.

“You know our work is dirty. Filth and human excreta are obvious, sometimes we even come across dead animals like dogs, cats and rats. Broken bottles lurking in darkness mark our bodies with scars and cuts.”

The incident comes weeks after four sanitation workers died of asphyxiation while cleaning a septic tank in Ghitorni. Nine sanitation workers have died in Delhi in 2017, so far.

Toxic sewage gases claimed two more lives when two sanitation workers entered a septic tank without any safety gear at a mall in Anand Vihar on August 12.

Government & civic bodies in denial mode

In stark contrast to reports, Delhi Jal Board says that the task of sewage cleaning is completely mechanised and that manual scavenging has not been in practice for almost a decade now in the capital.

“We get regular complaints of sewer blockage in the area but all the tasks are completely mechanised. We use manual labour only to open shallow lines which are two feet deep. We have all the safety gear including gum boots, masks, jackets etc, for workers in case it is required”, says Ravikant, a Delhi Jal Board Employee in North Delhi, while pointing at some sticks and rods kept in a corner of an ill-kept office.

“We use only machines to do the cleaning. We do not allow men to enter the sewers”, he adds.

Delhi Commission for Safai Karamcharies, the top authority for the welfare of sanitation workers in Delhi, works towards the rehabilitation of such workers and addresses the issues affecting their socioeconomic and working conditions. The four municipal bodies in Delhi employs around 20,000 sanitation workers to keep the city clean.

On March 2014, a landmark ruling from the Supreme Court said sewer workers should also be included in laws abolishing manual scavenging as they have to handle human excreta under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions while cleaning sewer lines, often without any protective gear.

“Employing manual labour to clean sewage systems is a clear violation of the Supreme Court’s ruling. It is extremely disheartening that in such modern times, everyday cases of deaths of sanitation workers are reported. We have sent a consolidated report about the recent deaths to the government requesting them to start an awareness camp against such practices,” said Sant Lal Chawariya, Chairman, Delhi Commission for Safai Karamcharies.

“While we know that manual scavenging has been abolished the by the law, there is no question of providing safety gear to men. Why are we still talking about safety equipment when manual scavenging has been abolished? We demand provision for punishment of employers who employee manual scavengers. As soon as a sanitation worker is employed to clean a sewer, the law is violated their itself,” he added.

The compensation to family members of the deceased as fixed by the apex court is Rs 10 lakh. Without protests and waiting for months, the family members do not receive a single penny.

""Swachh Bharat a failure""

The authorities say they are working towards the rehabilitation of such workers providing them better jobs like giving auto and taxi permits and assisting their children to get admission in schools for better education opportunities. However, much remains only on paper and is used to make hollow promises. Rehabilitation seems to be a distant dream for sanitation workers.

Bezwada Wilson, founder of Safai Karamchari Andolan and a recipient of Ramon Magsaysay Award, says: “Unfortunately, the government always goes into a mode of denial and believe it is not necessary to hear to the grievances of the sanitation workers. In March 2014, the Supreme Court directed the government to compile a list of deceased manual scavengers from 1993 and work towards the rehabilitation of their families. Till date, there has been zero effort from the government in this direction.”

bccl

Wilson believes the major issue with the government is that it does not consider organisations working towards the welfare of sanitation workers as a collective entity. Instead, it sees such bodies as a threat working against the government.

Criticising the Swachh Bharat Mission without mincing any words, Wilson says the pilot project of the Prime Minister of India has done nothing towards the welfare of sanitation workers. “Constructing new toilets without dismantling dry toilets is a directionless effort. The government is silent on this issue and is only highlighting the goal to construct 21 crore new toilets in the country. Swachh Bharat is about business. It is merely a corporate programme,” he adds.

More than 95 per cent of sewer workers are from India’s lowest social class, the Dalits, once known as “untouchables”. The job still exists because of the widespread apathy towards the Dalits, who form the most deprived community in the country despite efforts to end caste-based discrimination.

The government has failed to enforce The Employment of Manual Scavenging and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 2013, that made it illegal to employ manual scavengers. However, the law in itself is contradictory because it also outlines tests that must be conducted before a worker enters a sewer. It is a clear indication that the government itself cannot outlaw a job that employs a certain community, who would otherwise lack alternative work.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared the eradication of manual scavenging by 2019, the ground reality is starkly contrasting and chances of the fulfilment of the PM’s promise look grim."
Samsung May Launch The 1st Smartphone In The World That Could Tell You If You're Drunk!,"What if your smartphone could accurately tell you how drunk you were? Only a little drunk, well below the legal driving limit, or smash drunk, where the tiniest movement could result in your face meeting the floor?

REUTERS

Samsung may well be on its way to putting anxious drivers out of their misery, when they stop at the watering hole before driving back home on a weeknight.

Samsung has already launched the Galaxy S8, and it's due to launch the Galaxy Note 8 before the end of the year. While the former sported one of the best displays ever seen on smartphones, the latter could feature the world's first stylus with a built-in breathalyzer which is able to accurately determine the user's blood alcohol levels.

""Samsung filed a patent application for the S Pen that can measure the user's blood alcohol content in June 2016. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office approved it last month,"" according to a Korea Times report quoting a Samsung official. S Pen is the stylus that comes with Samsung's Galaxy Note series of devices.

Reuters

According to the patent, the S Pen doubles up as a breathalyzer and microphone, and when a user holds it in their hand a small part of S Pen bends almost 90 degrees, exposing a couple of sensors inside the tool to measure the alcohol level in the blood, all while the user is busy talking on the phone.

It is still not certain whether this breathalyzer S Pen will debut with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, scheduled to launch later this year. It's unusual for patents to be implemented immediately before extensive testing, but after the Galaxy Note 7 debacle last year, something tells us that Samsung will leave no stone unturned to ensure the Galaxy Note 8 is a smash hit.

Cheers to that, eh?"

Govt is bad at running hospitals. Let’s have Modicare instead,"In one of the most macabre and tragic incidents in recent times, 70 children died in BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur in the span of two days. The supplier allegedly cut supply of liquid oxygen after multiple unpaid bills. Many other theories are floating around too. Blame is being ascribed to the government, hospital authorities, the supplier, and some are even saying this isn’t about the oxygen shortage at all. Essentially, everyone involved has found someone to blame.

The children, however, are dead. Their families will have to live with this irreparable loss and immeasurable sorrow all their lives. Making things worse is the knowledge that this was avoidable. This happened because of one reason — utter mismanagement, a hallmark of government-run services in India.

Those who remember the pre-cellphone era days will recall the harrowing experience in obtaining a landline connection. Government-run hotels and airlines are usually of far poorer quality than their private counterparts.

When it comes to the Indian government, one thing is clear — it just can’t do complex services well. When the operations require constant interaction with lots of customers, quick decision-making and a certain amount of quality control, the government is simply terrible at running it.

Of course, mismanagement at MTNL meant you wouldn’t have a phone, and at Air India would mean your flight would be delayed. When things are bungled up in a hospital, you can die, en masse in this case.

The purpose of this article is not government bashing, something enough pieces have done. It is to make the government understand and accept its limitation — it just can’t do complex services well. The reason is simple. Most government staff adopt a ‘cover-their-backside’ approach to work. For government employees, there is no upside for initiative, creativity or improving things. In fact, if their ideas go wrong, they will suffer for it. Hence, the typical babu’s approach is this — do nothing new. Repeat, until retired.

This is why nobody acted on something as basic as oxygen in Gorakhpur. Ideally, the oxygen supplier should be on autopay. The hospital should also have an oxygen inventory system. Any meaningful drops should trigger an order, with automatic payments. Every hospital should have a line of credit for pre-approved emergency items. These are fairly obvious, implementable things. However, who will do this? Anybody suggesting so won’t get a raise, or a promotion or even recognition. However, if for some reason there are hiccups, the person will be blamed and punished (by perhaps a bad transfer or a stalling of his promotion). Hence, do nothing.

The bigger solution is to change this management style — across every government entity. Our government officials need to be empowered or incentivised to improve things.

The government can also take note of its limitations. While it doesn’t do complex services well, it does run fairly decent financial institutions. Money is a simpler product to handle (than, say, liquid oxygen and life-saving medicines) and routine systems are enough to keep things going. LIC is one of India’s top insurers. A better direction for the government would be to improve India’s medical insurance, and be less involved in running hospitals. Do note that some of India’s best doctors are in government hospitals. Talent does get attracted to government jobs and they can stay. However, it is the running of the hospitals —cleanliness, supplies, logistics and payments where the government falters. Get out of that. Insure more people. Give them a good coverage plan. Keep good doctors. And let more private players run the hospitals.

Some efforts like the Rural Health Insurance Scheme have been modestly successful, but have not transformed the medical sector. The insurance coverage given under such schemes is paltry. A new comprehensive medical insurance scheme (and it doesn’t have to be free) that offers Indian’s good medical coverage across the private and public health network may work better than the government running thousands of large hospitals. If there can be Obamacare, why not Modicare?

One also needs to relieve the excess pressure on the public health system. While some fault lies with poor management, some of what happened is due to overstretched healthcare facilities. Whether through insurance or new hospitals, we do need to spend more on healthcare (as a percentage of GDP).

Nothing can lessen the pain of the people who lost their kids. What we can hope is to learn lessons from this horrible incident and reform our healthcare system so Gorakhpur never, ever happens again."

"Construction of Rs 200 crore super speciality hospital to begin soon in Indore, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Representational image

INDORE: A tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Centre, MGM and construction agency will be signed on Monday to begin construction of long-pending super specialty hospital in the city.

The general manager of Bridge & Roof Co (India) Ltd Gurmukh Singh said the same in a meeting held by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Friday to finalize the land and discuss other important aspects of the proposed medical facility. After analyzing availability of land, its approach from main road, connectivity with MY Hospital and MGM and other important aspects, the concerned authorities agreed to establish super specialty hospital on a land available behind Cancer Hospital.

Divisional commissioner Sanjay Dubey, MGM in-charge dean Dr Salil Bhargava, nodal officer Dr Sumit Shukla and officials from PWD department were at the meeting.

During the meeting, the option of constructing the proposed hospital on a land available in front of Chacha Nehru Hospital was also discussed. The idea was later dropped due to some staff quarters and fully-grown trees on the land that may delay the project.

The central and state government has agreed to spend Rs 200 crore in a ratio of 60:40 per cent to start 15 super specialty facilities at the proposed hospital. The building will be parking + 8 floors. A discussion with the officials of construction agency regarding the construction works, installation of medical equipment and maintenance of the proposed building for a particular period of time was also held.

Singh informed the meeting of completing the construction work by December, 2018. A corridor between MY Hospital and new OPD building to the proposed hospital building will be constructed to ferry the patients through ambulances.

MGM dean also informed the gathering about sending a proposal to the state government to assign the work of procuring and carryout maintenance works of the medical equipment through HLL (Hindustan Latex Limited) Lifecare Limited."

The safe and effective measles vaccine costs about US $ 1 and it can save one life, he added. Bill Gates appreciated Lions support to Measles, he added.2000 students of the St. Peters Public School were vaccinated on the occasion.Measles Rubella Campaign is launched all over India in partnership with WHO & UNICEF as well, in addition to the Ministry of Health and Family welfare and other authorities. In Telangana, the MR campaign launched on Thursday will continue till the 25th September, 2017, with a target of reaching 90 Lakh Students aged between 9 months and 15 years.The campaign marks the introduction of the Rubella Vaccine in India’s childhood immunisaiton program for the first time. Measles Rubella is a highly contagious. It spreads through coughing and sneezing. Of the 1,34, 200 measles death globally in 2015, around 49,200 occurred in India—nearly 36 per cent.Lions of Telangana through their Mutliple District 320 and LCIF, will be promoting the campaign through their respective Districts and Clubs. They also planned a massive publicity drive to create awareness. According to R. Sunil Kumar, the past international director, they plan to spend rupees one crore on this publicity drive.The campaign is launched through the 7 Lions Districts and 450 Clubs of Lions Clubs International Multiple District(MD) 320, covering 31 Revenue Districts of Telangana State. The campaign encourages everyone to go for the vaccination. MD 320 has a membership of about 16,000 members including families of Lions and youth.In partnership with the Gates Foundation and GAVI (the international alliance for vaccination and immunization) this huge contribution further multiplies and makes it useful for the world in its battle to eliminate measles."

---------------------------------

Virat Kohli (2/2): ""I feel we need to start planning for the 2019 World Cup around 24 months in advance, try to experiment a bit here and there. We are taking that as a challenge and are looking to try out different things, things we wouldn't do usually. You can see a lot of surprises over the next few games. All the guys have bought into it and I am very excited. We thought Axar was a gun fielder and he brings his batting into play; and felt that one wrist spinner is enough. Also, Axar is a power-hitting batsman capable of hitting the big shots and that helps us. If we get a dry wicket we could go in with three spinners and a fast bowling all-rounder. At the start of a series we need to up our batting and Axar brings that balance for us as a team.""

Virat Kohli (1/2): ""They got off to a very good start. We thought we'd be chasing something close to 300; it was a brilliant wicket for batting. The whole idea of winning the toss and bowling first was hoping that the wicket would be slightly slow in the day. The ball was coming onto the bat like a dream under lights and Shikhar and me enjoyed batting together. At 129/1 we had a few things to think about but the bowlers came back superbly. The last three months have been a great time for Shikhar. The good thing is that he is capitalizing on his purple patch. He can win you games with the way he bats and we would be looking to keep him in that zone for as long as we can. He is feeling good about his game and is hitting the ball well. When he plays like this he is a match-winner and even in Tests he can win you games with the bat."""

Akshay Kumar Has A Strong Message For People Who Are Calling Him Out For Doing Propaganda Films,"Akshay Kumar is one of the most bankable actors in Bollywood today. Apart from doing a smart mix of comedy, socially-relevant films, he for sure understands his duties as a responsible citizen.

This year, he has laid hands on some of the most relevant topics that include sanitation and menstruation. However, some people are calling out Kumar for doing propaganda films.

Pinterest

Akshay Kumar’s latest Toilet: Ek Prem Katha has been tagged as a ‘propaganda film’ by some sections but the actor today said there is nothing wrong in raising relevant issues, which even the government is concerned about, through cinema.

screen grab/youtube

Directed by Shree Narayan Singh, the film stars Akshay in the lead role of a man, who tries to win back his wife by building a toilet at his home.

However, the criticism didn't go down too well with Akshay and he went onto defend his film and choices. He said,

“If the government is saying the same thing which is good and if you call that a propaganda, then okay we are doing propaganda. I believe building a toilet is extremely important, especially for women.""

screen grab/youtube

Akshay also spoke about his upcoming film Padman and explained why it's an important film. He said,

“I am talking about sanitary pads in ‘Padman’ and you’ll be sad to know that 91 per cent of women don’t use it because they can’t afford it. To talk about such things and bring them in the forefront isn’t propaganda. You want such issues to be highlighted and talked about,” said Akshay in a press conference via Skype from London.

Toilet is one of the most commercially successful films of the year but Akshay explained how it's not about numbers anymore. Instead, all he wants is people to watch his film that has an important message.

“At a lot of places the government is screening it. In Haryana, the CM is trying to show the film to the head of villages. Even in some villages in UP, it is being shown. I just got to know even Doordarshan wants to show the film soon because they have a big reach. My idea is to grab more eyeballs and not money. That was the whole idea behind the film.”

Though Akshay has been a part of socially-relevant films be it Airlift, Baby to Toilet…', he also defended his choices as an actor and explained why it's not right to typecast him. He added,

"India@70: Reshaping diets, speeches and even our thoughts","Let’s start with what happened at a madrassa on Independence Day this year. Little boys and girls, neatly dressed and holding paper flags, were seated on a dhurrie, when a reporter strolled in. Mistaking the journalist for a government officer, sent to ‘check’ and report to headquarters, the madrassa teacher hastily assured the hack everything was on track. “The children have just finished singing the national anthem…but they will sing it again for you if you want, sir.” What a telling moment! Doesn’t that innocent reaction say everything? To me, this incident was far more revealing of the sentiments across the country than the superb interview of Hamid Ansari, and the censored television address of Tripura CM Manik Sarkar. Taken as a whole, these unconnected but significant incidents point to just one thing: Paranoia, and a lack of trust. As Hamid Ansari stated, “Overall, the very fact that the Indianness of any citizen is being questioned is a disturbing thought.”

Narendra Modi may have been extra considerate this year, when he made the shortest (56 minutes) Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. As expected, it was peppered with the usual alliterations, and word play with the rather trite ‘golis’ and ‘gaalis’ reference. There was little by way of content to reassure citizens when exactly the elusive ‘acche din’ will finally arrive — if they exist at all. Just a few days earlier, Hamid Ansari had spoken up boldly during an impassioned parting interview, in which he’d gone ahead and addressed the herd of elephants in India’s room. There was shock, awe and admiration when he candidly talked about the “sense of unease among Muslims”, and referred to “a sense of insecurity creeping in”. Was he lying? Exaggerating? Over-dramatising? Of course not! He had hit the bull’s eye. If the underlying truth in what he said didn’t make us flinch, it should have. The Prime Minister had two choices once Ansari’s interview gained momentum: A) He could have ignored Ansari. B) Or, Modi could have equally boldly stated it was time to address these prickly issues head on, since they perturb over 184 million Muslim citizens of India. He did neither. Instead, he picked a third, and very shabby option: he not only mocked the erudite gentleman who had been India’s respected Vice President for two terms (2007-2017) by saying that he had shown his true colours (read: Muslim identity) and advised him to “follow your basic ideology and instinct.” If this is not provocative and divisive, what is? To make it worse, the BJP dubbed Ansari a “mannerless” man.

Chief Minister Manik Sarkar publicly stated his position (outrage!) after being asked to ‘reshape’ his Independence Day speech. That word ‘reshape’ is dangerous and loaded. Today, an elected chief minister of an important, sensitive state is being asked to ‘reshape’ a pre-recorded speech which was found unacceptable by Big Brother (Prasar Bharati). What chance do ordinary citizens have? We will soon be ordered — perhaps at gunpoint — to ‘reshape’ our words, thoughts, even emotions. Our diets have already been ‘reshaped’. This is perhaps the first time in 70 years that a chief minister’s speech has been targeted. Surely, citizens have the right to hear it, regardless of what the Centre feels? Hamid Ansari raised the very pertinent Muslim issue of identity and belonging in today’s India, while Manik Sarkar pointed out that Dalits and minorities are under attack. Are they making it up?

These are but two intelligent, educated, aware men daring to voice what countless citizens fear. Ansari has already withdrawn into a neutral zone after the Prime Minister’s below-the-belt tongue lashing. Let’s see what happens to Manik Sarkar, who has openly accused the Central Government of censorship. When asked what action he planned to take, he answered soberly and thoughtfully, “I have brought this to the notice of the common people of our country. They are the best ones to judge what is going on.”

The problem in placing so much trust in the common people is this: when the Centre controls virtually every bit of what is available for public consumption, the narrative becomes not just one-dimensional and one-sided, but also gets twisted beyond recognition. Who the hell knows what’s going on in India? Not me. Not the average citizen. And that is far scarier than the prospect of a ‘small war’ with China. I am waiting for some brilliant Niti Aayog spokesperson to reshape, recycle and represent our immediate future. The past has been taken care of, thank you."
Squash Champion Harinder Pal Sandhu Is Upset After Not Being Named In The Arjuna Award List,"Country's leading squash player Harinder Pal Sandhu, the 2014 Asian Games team gold medalist, has been left dejected after being ignored by the Arjuna awards selection panel for the third time.

""I was pretty confident that I would be chosen for the honour this time. It is deeply disappointing when you are not picked despite being a deserving candidate,"" Sandhu said.

BCCL/Representational Image

The 28-year-old is left with no other option than to apply for the award next year with the sports ministry confirming the recipients list yesterday.

Sandhu, a winner of nine titles on the pro tour PSA, had played a big role in India winning its maiden squash gold at the Asian Games. He teamed up with Saurav Ghosal to beat a fancied Malaysia in the gold medal match in Incheon.

Ghosal, who has been India's number one male squash player for a long time, has also come out in support of Sandhu saying he was a lot more deserving for the Arjuna than someone like an Anaka Alankamony, who controversially received the honour in 2014.

BCCL

""If benchmarks used for Harry (Sandhu) and Anaka were the same, then Harry should have got the award ahead of her. There is no doubt about that. Harry has also won a national title while Anaka never won one,"" said Ghosal, who lost to Sandhu in the 2015 Nationals before regaining the title the following year.

The famous Indian squash trio of Ghosal, Joshna Chinappa and Dipika Pallikal have all been rewarded with an Arjuna.

However, Sandhu is yet to win an individual medal at the Asian or Commonwealth level and it might have affected his chances. He, though, has always been an important member in team events.

BCCL

Sandhu is disheartened with the snub but remains determined to make a stronger case for Arjuna next year.

""We have the Asian and Commonwealth Games next year and will try to win a medal in both the events. I am sure, after I win medals there, it will become more difficult for the committee to ignore me,"" said the world number 65, who recently won a couple of PSA 5K titles in Australia, taking his overall tally to nine.

"A Village In Andhra Pradesh Is Striving To Achieve 100% Sanitation In 1,000 Days","It takes a foreign trip for an Indian to realise the kind of filth and litter we have on our roads. It almost feels like we pay thousands and lakhs just to be in cleaner place, considering that India is as beautiful as any other country out there- we have mountains, rivers, cascading waterfalls, pristine beaches and everything sans cleanliness.

dna/ A Picture Of Versova Beach After The Clean Drive

This social awakening about keeping surroundings clean came to India 3 years ago, with Modi's promising and aspiring 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'.

Around this time, public anguish turned into several private projects governed by individuals, institutes, committees, groups of people and sometimes an entire village.

One such village is Challapalli village in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, that began a campaign titled, ‘Swachh Challapalli’.

swachhindia

The campaign aims to achieve at 100 per cent sanitation and cleanliness within 1000 days, August 7 being the 1000th day. Today, on June 29, it is the 961st day and the village is almost nearing its target.

This initiative was a brainchild of Katta Padmavathi, Sarpanch of Challapalli village, who also collaborated with Manakosam Manam Trust (MMT) for the complete eradication the atrocities of waste management, cleanliness levels, open defecation and waste segregation.

swachhindia

The village is now going under a massive behavioural change, where they take care of their own belongings and vicinity. They've also set up underground drainage systems and composting unit to fight it thoroughly.

swachhindia

Out of 4850 households, nearly 520 didn’t own a toilet, but during this drive, 520 new toilets were built. Other than that, the village is already bearing the responsibility of building public toilets, individual septic latrines, a well-connected sewage system, and drains.

“There were awareness campaigns led by the panchayat committee in collaboration with the foundation to educate people about waste segregation. Within a few months, every household of Challapalli started to separate dry and wet waste,” said Mr Bollineni, added Prasad Bollineni, Panchayat Secretary.

The initiative has inspired a lot of nearby villages and has subsequently contributed in building awareness about a healthy surrounding."

"There are many projects in India to sequence human genomes: Brenda J Andrews, Health News, ET HealthWorld",", Professor and Director,, Canada, talks to ETHealthworld about the growth of functional genomics and their collaboration with India. Edited excerpts:The difference between genomics and functional genomics is that “genomics” is the science of determining a genome sequence. We can determine genome sequences now in any organism in a very short period of time for little money. Functional genomics is the science of trying to understand the information and that requires us to manipulate it in some way to see what the consequences are of perturbing certain genes and certain sequences in the genome. There is no technology of doing that in all systems. Doing a focussed experiment is a major challenge which will require huge investments by labs around the world, to try to really understand what each gene in the human genome is doing and how the genomes work together to make the cells function the way they do. We need to understand how these genes basically are wired together in order to make a certain outcome. We are getting there in some of the projects that are ongoing in our centre which involve trying to perturb genes by themselves or in combination of trying to figure out what happens to the cells. I hope over the next few years a lot of current methods will be developed such as genome engineering methods that have come out in the last few years. Those can be further developed so that we can do functional genomics experiment much faster and interpret them better.The Donnelly Centre was established about 10 years ago with the idea of setting up centre for biology and the idea was to make rapid progress in functional genomics. Mainly we need to put scientists with different expertise together in the same place. We are at the University of Toronto, it has a great computer science department, a great chemistry department, big faculty of medicine but those people never use to talk to each other. So we thought to put them together in the same space and then new science will emerge. The building opened in 2006, our scientists in the building were from applied sciences in engineering, people that were experts in stem cell engineering, other people from the chemistry department and a lot of computer scientists cause you need a lot of computer scientists to interpret genome information. In the last 10 years we also requited new people into the building which filled the gaps in our expertise and now we have many ongoing projects that involve collaborations between at least 5-6 different scientists in the centre and their trainees. So we consider that our bigger success that is our project has started because of who we are and where we are together, in the same building and that probably wouldn’t have happened if we were scattered across other buildings.The partnering with India that is ongoing at the moment was set up largely by Sachdev Sidhu who is a professor in the Donnelly Centre. He was recruited to the centre from genetics in the United States where he developed platforms for doing a technical platform called Phage Display and this allowed him to engineer proteins. So these are the building blocks or protein that were encoded by the DNA to engineer proteins to do basically what he wanted them to do and the specialty is antibodies which are one of the largest growing drug sectors in the world. So they have setup this platform at the Donnelly centre and has been collaborating to try to think about how we might together make new antibodies that are largely oncology targets together.It is hard to predict because five years ago if you asked me how I see the future I would have been completely wrong. The reasons are two: DNA sequencing got a lot cheaper and we have got better methods for genome engineering. So the CRISPR Cas9 system can now be used to precisely engineer the human genome and that wasn’t available 5 years ago. It is hard to predict if you can’t even imagine what techniques might come so that makes it a challenging but also a very exciting time in biomedicine. I certainly think that we might have huge amounts of genome sequencing information. I know that there are many projects here in India to sequence human genomes. There are projects like that around the world and I think we will get way better in understanding it; our computational methods will get better so I think the flow of information 5 years from now will be much smoother and much valuable."

Remove BCCI's current office bearers: CoA to SC

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 05:39 PM

The CoA is unhappy with the ouster of CEO Rahul Johri from the BCCI meeting © AFP

In its fifth status report submitted to the Supreme Court, the Committee of Administrators (CoA) has asked for the removal of the current office bearers of the BCCI for the non-compliance of the court's orders to adopt the Lodha reforms. The CoA cited the court's January 2 ruling that ousted Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke from their BCCI posts, for the eviction of acting president CK Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary.

""The Committee of Administrators submits that since the then President and Secretary of the BCCI had been removed because the BCCI failed to implement the reforms mandated by the Judgement despite a period of six months having passed, it is only fair that the current office bearers be treated in the same manner because a further period of six months have elapsed since the said office bearers submitted their undertakings and the reforms mandated by this Hon'ble Court have still not been implemented,"" the report stated.

The report has been submitted two days ahead of the July 18 hearing, wherein the three-member SC bench comprising Justices Deepak Misra, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud will reconsider some of the Lodha recommendations which it previously accepted, like the one-state-one-vote, strength of the selection committee and the concept of associate membership. Earlier in an SGM held on July 26, BCCI had decided to selectively adopt the Lodha reforms, leaving out five of them.

It was during the same SGM on July 26, when BCCI CEO Rahul Johri was asked to leave. The latest report by CoA, claims that the office-bearers deliberately misconstrued the SC order and ousted Johri from the SGM.

""After the attendance register was signed, the CEO and the other administrative staff including the legal team of the BCCI was asked to leave the meeting on the purported basis that the order dated July 24, 2017 passed by this hon'ble Court only permits office bearers to attend the same""

The CoA further wrote that this was a pre-planned and orchestrated move by the BCCI and explained the 'obvious' motive behind the same. ""The motivations of such a clever manoeuvre are fairly obvious. The presence of the CEO in the previous SGM held on June 26, 2017 had enabled the Comittee of Administrators to receive first-hand account of the proceedings and bring conduct of certain specific individuals to the attention of this Hon'ble Court. The absence of CEO from the July 26 SGM would make (and has made) that task very difficult.""

The CoA brought to SC's notice that the BCCI had failed to adopt a new fund disbursement policy which was formulated by Deloitte in line with the Lodha reforms. ""Adoption of the new fund disbursment policy by BCCI is one such reform aimed at ensuring proper allocation of funds to the State Associations based on need/requirement and with appropriate checks in place to ensure proper utlization and reporting by State associations.""

The report conveyed to the SC, BCCI's failure to appoint a new Ombudsman, despite the position being left vacant since September 2016 after the Justice (retd.) AP Shah stepped down. He had been roped in to address the conflict of interest issues prevalent within Indian cricket. The CoA also noted that the BCCI failed to adopt the new BCCI conflict of interest rules during the SGM in July, despite being handed the copy of the same through email more than a month prior to the meeting. Since the BCCI did not list new conflict of interest rules as one of the five reforms it was against, there was no justifiable reason for BCCI to not adopt the same.

Did You Know That According To Science The Best Way To Drink Whiskey Is To Dilute It With Water?,"A religious whiskey drinker may insist having his drink on the rocks or with a dash of water added to it. Well, it turns out there’s good reason for that and it's one that now even science backs.

alkotraz.ru

Researchers at the Linnaeus University in Sweden carried out a test to examine how compounds such as guaiacol in whiskey moved around with the presence of water in it.

They concurred that adding water to your drink frees guaiacol from its entrapments and enhances its smell and taste!

The flavour in whiskey comes from the molecule called guaiacol, which is what gives whiskey its smoky, spicy and peaty flavour. It resembles other compounds such as vanillin (a compound that tastes like vanilla).

majesticwinespiritspa.com

The study published in the journal Scientific Reports was conducted to simulate what happens to guaiacol in different concentrations of water.

Since water and ethanol don't mix that well drinks contain clusters of ethanol, which trap aromatic compounds such as guaiacol, hampering what the drink should ideally taste like.

Whisky is distilled at concentrations of alcohol above 59 percent. But whiskeys like Jack Daniels come bottled at a dilution of 40 to 45 percent where the ethanol and guaiacol accumulate at the surface.

shayorepublic.com

Diluting it to around 27 percent overall alcohol by adding a dash of water allows the guaiacol to ‘aerosolize’ and dispersed away from the surface, which allows the fragrant compounds to waft into your nose and keep your spirits high and holding on to your favourite drink!

hellorf.com

Since the taste, smell and flavour of your drink go hand-in-hand and the fact that the right amount of water is what is needed to enhance the flavour, it makes you wonder why whiskey isn’t manufactured at lower concentrations?

I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."
The Economic Times,"A short list of upcoming solar eclipses India can see A total solar eclipse is a celestial showstopper and an event that is as rare as it gets, so much so that US has had to wait for 99 years for something like this. No wonder then that hordes of Americans are making plans to catch the August 21 total solar eclipse in US. Indians won't get to witness a total solar eclipse till 2034, but there’s an annular eclipse waiting for us right in 2019. Here's a look at upcoming solar eclipses and where they will be visible:

Scientists to capture sunspot images during solar eclipse New York, Aug 19 (IANS) During the upcoming total solar eclipse on August 21, a team of solar physicists are planning to capture high-resolution sunspots -- the visible concentrations of magnetic fields on the Sun's surface -- at microwave radio wavelengths.

"Charlottesville Fallout: In drawing equivalence between far-right groups and liberals, Trump is undermining American democratic values","The raging turmoil in the US following the Charlottesville racist attack is being stoked by none other than President Donald Trump. Instead of condemning the attack – which saw a suspected white supremacist ram his car into a crowd of protesters opposing a rally of far-right organisations – in unequivocal terms, Trump has sought to draw equivalence between the two groups and blamed both for the violence. If this weren’t enough, Trump has now criticised the nationwide movement of removing statues and memorials dedicated to pro-slavery Confederate figures from America’s civil war. He has described these statutes and memorials as part of American history and adding to the beauty of the cities and parks they are located in.

Needless to say this is total hogwash. America’s evolution as a democracy has long rejected racism and provided a beacon for emancipation and human rights. Of course, this process is ongoing as exemplified by the prevalence of racist incidents even today in the US. But in official political discourse racist thought, ideas and spirit have been totally rejected.

Trump, however, is seeking to overturn this. It’s clear now that white supremacists and the alt-right comprise his core constituency. And it is to send subtle messages of solidarity to this group that Trump is using sophisticated language that appears to project neutrality in readings of history. This is nothing but another clever ploy by right-wing groups across the world to gain political traction. Under the garb of objectivity, these groups are trying to bring back in vogue dark figures of history. In doing so they are sanitising chapters of the past that ought to shock and revolt. Somehow, objectivity is becoming the rallying cry of the most obscurantist forces in society.

Saying that public statutes and memorials of controversial figures from the American civil war should be left alone because they are part of history is unacceptable. These monuments offend the sensibilities of a majority of American people, not just the African-American community. As a counterfactual, if the Confederates had won the American civil war, US democracy wouldn’t have evolved the way it did and Barack Obama would never have become a president. But that’s not what happened and most American people are proud that the US is considered as a leader of plural democracy. Hence, to ascribe equivalence to an alternative right-wing narrative of US history is specious – that narrative was defeated and rejected.

Similarly, Trump criticising the removal of statues and memorials of Confederate figures by saying that tomorrow it could lead to removal of monuments dedicated to the country’s founding fathers who were slave owners is again trickery to fool people. America’s founding fathers stood for anti-colonialism and republicanism. They belonged to a time when, unfortunately, overall human and political consciousness hadn’t evolved to the point of recognising the inherent injustice of slavery. But that isn’t the case with Confederate figures from the Civil War who fought to preserve the way of life in the American South, including slavery.

America’s founding fathers are celebrated for fighting for liberty and self-determination, not for preserving slavery. But Confederate figures actually fought to protect the slave economy of the American South. Hence, there’s a huge difference between the two groups. Ultimately, people who read and interpret history do need to take sides and make qualitative judgments. Slavery was bad. Nazism was bad. The Holocaust was bad. One simply can’t treat these dark chapters of the past as normal historical incidents. If we do that, how are we ever going to learn from history and stop repeating mistakes of the past?"

The battle against cancer is heating up,"India’s battle against cancer has never been on a high but the scenario could now change, thanks to an unique effort from a corporate honcho and a seasoned cancer physician who are keen to highlight why cancer is on the rise across the world and pose a particular threat in many low- and middle-income countries.

Their efforts are making many sit up and take notice. The war against cancer, thanks to the duo, has reached a new level. Indians are understanding why cancer deaths globally far exceed those from such devastating infectious diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. International health agencies admit that global mortality from those three diseases has, in fact, been cut substantially — by nearly half in the case of malaria — over the past decade, but cancer is a different, difficult disease to handle, the two and their friends have explained.

R Venkataramanan, a suave corporate manager who always wears white, starched shirt and black trousers like a lawyer, and Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, and their band of friends are asking Indians to cut down on tobacco consumption because it – sooner or later – leads to cancer.

Those who argue against them are asked by Venkataramanan to visit the Tata Memorial Cancer hospital at 0800 hours when new patients walk in for admissions. It is, by any means, a horrible sight to see patients in total despair, hoping to live and not die.

“Seeing is believing, a bomb is ticking away and Indians are still not realising the gravity of the situation,” says Venkataramanan, who insists that he should not be addressed as project manager at Tata Trusts. It is his war, and that of his friends like Sumitra Pednekar, whose husband Satish Pednekar, a former home and labour minister in Maharashtra, died of throat cancer and some doctors from Tata Memorial Hospital whose PIL in the Bombay high court against the government and state-run insurers, including LIC, for holding shares in Kolkata-based cigarette maker ITC, has made many sit up and take notice.

The petition is being heard and seasoned lawyers – expectedly – have lined up to defend the tobacco major. But that, claims Venkataramanan, should not take the sting out of the fight against cancer. The duo have figures from the International Agency for Research on Cancer to back their claim.

IARC says cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases in 2012. In two decades, the number of new cases is expected to rise by about 70 percent. Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and was responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2015. Globally, nearly 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer. “The most commonly diagnosed cancers were lung, breast and colorectal cancers such as lung, mouth and throat are attributable to tobacco habits,” says Dr Chaturvedi. Less-developed regions of the world accounted for more than half of all new cancer cases and almost two-thirds of all cancer deaths.

The debate is growing stronger by the day. Those against cancer argue if nothing is done to reduce smoking, smokers will soar across the world. Hence, it’s imperative that international trade agreements uphold the ability of individual countries to regulate the sale and marketing of tobacco products within their borders. But the tobacco industry – flushed with cash – argues that this would restrict free trade. Analysts call it a frivolous argument, little more than an effort by tobacco companies to bully their way into emerging markets.

Venkataramanan says from a health perspective, it is also dangerously irresponsible. He argues tobacco control efforts have been credited with preventing about eight million premature deaths. Yet tobacco control in many countries across the world is quite weak. And India is one of them.

Worse, only about a third of the world prohibit smoking in public places, and very few countries follow the World Health Organization recommendation to tax cigarettes at 75 percent of the retail price. There are other issues as well. Cancer scientists always focus on only cigarettes in their analysis, leaving out cancers caused by secondhand smoke, pipes, hookahs, beedis, cigars, smokeless tobacco and electronic nicotine, delivery systems

Venkatramanan wants some serious conversations around cancer because tobacco is responsible for nearly 50 percent cancers in India and 90 percent of mouth cancer patients die within 12 months of diagnosis.

For strange reasons, everyone wants to avoid the debate.

The insurance companies, along with UTI, argue they are trying to get the best return on their investments and that they are not promoting use of tobacco or even the company in any way. Together, they hold 32 percent stake in ITC, worth Rs 1.07 trillion.

India’s biggest argument over what many claim is the biggest life-threatening disease, has just begun. Eventually, someone will have to take a call, to invest or not invest."

"Bengaluru To Soon Have India's First Heli Taxi, Will Fly You To The Airport At The Cost Of A Cab","There's this one joke that always cracks me up about Bengaluru's traffic. A guy left for the airport to pick his girlfriend up, who was coming from Pune and they both left at the same time.

Faking News

As joke-worthy all these stories may seem, the traffic in India's hottest metropolitan city can be a real pain for those who live there. Imagine taking hours to cover a meagre distance or spending more than half your salary just on petrol.

Amid this crisis, the news of heli-taxi comes as an overdue respite. Folks in Bangalore will now have a cheaper and quicker alternative to fight the city's notorious traffic.

jagranjosh

India's first chopper taxi service was announced earlier this month and Bengaluru is the city to have these operations commence by December 2017. Authorities at the Bengaluru International Airport Ltd. (BIAL) have tied up a deal with the Thumby Aviation, a Kerala based helicopter service to facilitate the heli-taxi service.

The service will shuttle the passengers from city to the airport on demand and at a price equivalent to that of taxis. For instance, a ride from Electronic City, Bengaluru to Kempegowda International Airport will take 15 minutes on average, a fraction of the 90-150 minutes it can take by road.

Initially, the one six seaters Bell 407 chopper will operate on the routes, but it will soon be expanded to Whitefield and the HAL airport in the near future. That said, city's 90 helipads will now come alive to serve people who'd flown from different locations.

How will Chinese use of force in Doklam manifest?,"In competitive conflict among nations, when faced with the threat of use of force by an adversary and if you set out to confront him and call his bluff, Plan A is generally based on the premise that the adversary will not actually use force due to political, economic and military compulsions. However, Plan B is also prepared to actually deal with the threat if it manifests itself. The handling of the two month long standoff in Doklam and recurring Chinese incursions elsewhere are still based on Plan A.

This, of course, is based on post 1962 War and 1967 Nathu La experience, notably the standoffs at Sumdrong Chu 1986-87, Depsang 2013 and Chumar 2014. Thus, on the ground, we see Indian and Chinese soldiers are physically confronting each other below Doka La with neither side using “force” except for the “jostling” in the initial stages. There is no let-up in Chinese jingoistic rhetoric and threats. Diplomacy does not seem to have made much headway. The mood in Delhi is “jung nahin hogi”. Except for the Indian Army moving for the annual summer “operational alert” there are no reports of any large scale mobilisation by either side. Is the current standoff going the way of the previous prolonged “peaceful” standoffs?

In this backdrop, let us look at Plan B on both sides. Before this, an obvious point must be made. Nations armed with nuclear weapons do not, and I dare say, cannot fight a full scale conventional war that causes major loss of territory, large scale casualties and destruction of economic infrastructure. The probability of even a limited war in multiple sectors along the LAC is relatively low. The probability of a limited war in the area of confrontation is much higher. The moot question is what form will it take?

The Indian Army’s Plan B is that all along the LAC and particularly in Sikkim, we hold dominating heights in high altitude terrain. Our defences are “hardened” and are backed by adequate fire power, including missiles carrying Precision Guided Munitions (PGM). We have adequate reserve for counter attack and we also have tactical counter offensive capability in each theatre. Along the LAC and in Tibet the IAF has an edge. It can carry out a strategic air campaign to target the PLA centres of gravity in Tibet, namely, command and control centres, military infrastructure and troop concentrations. Indian Navy is capable of strategic interdiction of sea lanes through the Indian Ocean. We also have the option of preempting the PLA with an operational level preemptive offensive, before it mobilises in Ladakh, Chumbi Valley and North Sikkim.

In a nutshell, we are looking to fight a low end third generation war to give the PLA a bloody nose. My take is that if the limited war whether in multiple sectors or in the Sikkim Sector, takes this form, we will stalemate the Chinese which is defeat for them.

The question that arises is why would China initiate a war where its defeat is ordained? Or does it have a more imaginative Plan B that teaches India a lesson? The PLA has adopted and adapted to the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) for the last two decades, particularly in the field of cyber warfare and PGM technology. It is now only second to the USA in high-end military technology. My assessment is that the Chinese will neutralise our strategy by not getting involved in “close infantry combat” over unfavourable terrain. If at all it chooses to use force, its strategy will be based on technological warfare with overwhelming use of PGM and cyber warfare. It will restrict its initial offensive to the Doklam and Sikkim Sector, but would be prepared for escalation to other sectors.

Such an attack will come in the winter, when conventional ground operations are severely restricted. PLA will carry out minimal mobilisation to cater to the unlikely tactical offensive by India in the winter. A massive PGM attack will be launched on our troops at Doklam and Doka La using cruise missiles and artillery after pulling out its own troops to safety.

Simultaneously, a massive cyber attack will be launched to neutralize our command and control systems and our fire power means. The strike will be with a declared limited aim of evicting us from Doklam. Depending upon our strategic and operational response, the PLA will escalate with similar attacks on more defensive positions in Sikkim and other sectors.

Are we prepared for such an attack? Are our defences sufficiently “hardened” and “tunnelled” to withstand a massive PGM attack? What is our progress in implementing the RMA? Do we have missile interception means? Are we trained and prepared for a winter offensive to make territorial gains? Do we have adequate counter attack capabilities using cyber warfare and PGMs?

I have no doubts that our Armed Forces have catered for such an eventuality. What measures, we can and should take will be discussed in the next column.

"Quality drug test: Bad Medicine! Pfizer, Cipla, DRL, other 63 drug firms fail quality test, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: Pfizer Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Cipla are among 66 drug makers that have some of their products failing quality tests carried out by the country’s drug regulator.Samples tested from these companies were found to be not of standard quality during a drug survey carried out through the National Institute of Biologicals over two years, according to a Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation ( CDSCO ) notification posted on its website. At least five samples of drugs from these companies failed the tests during the 2014-2016 survey, CDSCO said.According to the notification, 25 samples by Pfizer, nine each by Dr Reddy’s and Alembic, seven by Cipla and six by Zydus Healthcare were found to be not of standard quality. It didn’t specify the drugs that failed the tests.A Pfizer spokesperson said the company was unable to confirm authenticity of products picked for the tests, or the evidence of the alleged deficiencies “as the due process of providing a sealed market sample was not followed"".Samples of the company's products were found to be fully compliant with all required specifications during tests at independent FDA-approved laboratories, the spokesperson said, adding that this was communicated to the regulatory authorities and no further action was recommended.“Pfizer places the utmost importance on product quality and patient safety. All Pfizer products released in the market meet every national and international testing specification,” the spokesperson said.Other companies ET contacted for comment did not respond until press time Friday.The survey, conducted to check the proportion of substandard drugs in the country, had tested 47,012 samples from 1,719 manufacturing units, CDSCO said. Around 3.16% of these samples were found to be not of standard quality, while 0.02% were spurious.India expects to bring down the proportion of its substandard drugs to 2% over the next three years to match global standards.

"FM Jaitely urges states to reduce VAT on petroleum products used for making goods, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today urged state governments to reduce Value Added Tax ( VAT ) on petroleum products used for making goods which attract Goods and Service Tax ( GST ), an official statement said. The move is aimed at easing tax burden on manufacturing sectors using petroleum products.The GST regime rolled out on 1 July excludes crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel and jet fuel while other products such as kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha are included in GST. In the pre-GST regime, both petroleum products and final goods produced attracted VAT and hence input tax credit of petroleum products used as inputs by manufacturers was allowed to varying extent by different states.However, in the post-GST regime, the manufactured goods attract GST while the inputs of petroleum products like natural gas, petrol and diesel used in manufacturing of the products attract VAT which leads to stranded taxes and cascading of taxes.“In view of this, in the pre GST regime certain States had lower rate of 5% VAT on Compressed Natural Gas used for manufacturing of goods. Some States also had lower rate of VAT on diesel being used for manufacturing sector. Thus the FM has requested other states also to explore the possibility of having lower VAT on petroleum products used for manufacturing items on which there is GST, so that there is minimum disruption in the costing of goods,” the statement said.At least one analyst told ETEnergyWorld VAT reduction on petroleum products used in manufacturing would reduce tax disadvantage currently suffered by City Gas Distribution (CGD) Companies as well as Piped Natural Gas (PNG) consumers along with the power, Ceramics, Glass, Chemicals, Pharma, Dairy, Steel and Engineering industry.“Currently CGD companies face a significant disadvantage when they sell PNG (Industrial and Commercial) as it continues to attract VAT on which input tax credit cannot be availed by its consumers who would be under GST. On the other hand, if they were to use liquid fuels such as Fuel Oil, Diesel, Naphtha, LPG, input tax credit is available because these products come under GST. If the states were to reduce VAT on PNG, that will reduce the tax disadvantage suffered by CGD companies and some of their consumers,” K Ravichandran, Senior Vice President at ICRA told ETEnergyWorld .He also added sectors such as ceramics, glass, chemicals, pharma, dairy, steel and engineering will be benefited as many of them use PNG. If the VAT were to be lower, under recoveries of companies operating in these sectors on taxes will be lower, which will improve their cost structure.Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), the statistical arm of the oil ministry has projected the natural gas demand for the financial year 2017-2018 to be 494 Million Metric Standard Cubic Meter Per Day (MMSCMD). Of which the power industry would require 225 MMSCMD followed by the fertilizer industry requiring 113 MMSCMD, city gas distribution 47 MMSCMD and Industrial requirement of 28 MMSCMD among others. Sanjiv Singh , Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ), the country’s largest fuel retailer, had recently said the firm is in talks with state governments for deferring levy of VAT on petrol, diesel, Aviation Turbine Fuel and crude oil to reduce the tax impact of these products as they are outside the ambit of GST."

"Indian thrust on renewables will affect thermal projects: CEA, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Overemphasis on renewable energy would result in reducing viability of coal-fired thermal power plants in India, adding to the massive non-performing assets (NPAs) of state-run lenders, Chief Economic Adviser ( CEA Arvind Subramanian said on Thursday.""Rapid changes in technology are promising to help realize the promise of renewables, which is an eminently desirable development. At the same time, these changes need to be seen in the context of India's current economic situation and its enormous endowments of coal, which is still a very cheap way of providing energy to hundreds of millions who are still energy-deprived,"" he said at the 16th Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture here organised by The Energy and Resources Institute ( TERI ).Noting that both coal and renewable sources should be the focus of power generation, Subramanian said that ""for India today, the social cost of renewables is higher than that of thermal power, and it is highly unlikely for the converse to be true, at least for some time"".""Over-expansion, fuelled by the growth optimism of the mid-2000s, combined with stresses in the discoms and slowdown in the economy has led to a plummeting plant load factors, declining profitability, the spectre of large amounts of stranded power assets, and consequentially stranded coal assets as well.""All this can have a detrimental effect on the health of the banking sector, especially the public sector banks, in the country, which in turn can adversely impact the health of the Indian economy, already afflicted by the 'twin balance sheet' challenge,"" the CEA said.The declining viability of thermal power plants and the rising NPAs of state-run banks, which have lent to power companies ""seems a double whammy for the government,"" he said.For India, which is struggling to provide basic electricity to about 25 per cent of its population, coal will provide about 60 per cent of the country's power needs until 2030, he addedIndia's total renewable generation capacity has crossed 57 gigawatts (GW), with an increase of 24.5 per cent being registered in the last fiscal year.

"China's solar power panels shine spotlight on North Korea trade, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Dandong, China : Traders from North Korea visit Yuan Huan's shop in the Chinese border city of Dandong several times a month to place orders, bringing their own translators and wads of cash.

Yuan, manager of Sangle Solar Power, said sales to North Koreans have soared in the past two years, one of the border businesses still thriving despite growing US pressure for China to limit commerce with the Stalinist regime.

Since North Korea mostly relies on outdated generators, blackouts are common and solar panels are prized for their role as backup power.

Berkeley-based researchers at the Nautilus Institute estimated that at the end of 2014, about two percent of North Korea's population had acquired solar panels.

And despite new United Nations sanctions further narrowing the categories of goods that can be traded with the hermit state this month, solar panels have remained off the growing blacklist.

Yuan's shop offers a window into how Chinese traders do business with North Korea, a country with few allies and whose economy relies heavily on China's patronage.

Every day, trucks filled with cargo cross the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge that connects Dandong to the North Korean city of Sinuiju.

After receiving orders from North Korean customers, Yuan drops off packages at a riverside depot, and a Chinese logistics company takes care of transport across the waterway.

Some of her North Korean customers place orders by phone, but most prefer to make arrangements in person, she said.

""It is actually quite easy for traders to go back and forth. Some buy over 20 units at a time,"" Yuan told AFP.

Several North Korean solar energy research and assembly plants have begun operation in recent years, according to domestic media reports, but Chinese panels appear to remain in high demand.

Last year, China exported 466,248 solar panels across the border, according to official figures from Beijing.

- Immune from sanctions? -

China on Tuesday started banning imports of iron, iron ore and seafood from North Korea as it implements the new UN sanctions, which could cost Pyongyang $1 billion per year and were imposed after its two intercontinental ballistic missile tests.

But in Dandong, where some 70 percent of trade between China and North Korea flows, solar panel merchants remain unfazed.

""It seems that overall, there are fewer North Korean traders coming over recently, but we're not affected by what's happening politically,"" said Shi Zhiyong, manager of the Huang Ming Solar Power shop.

""In 2009, I started seeing more North Korean traders coming to the store and their numbers have only gone up since,"" Shi told AFP.

Both Yuan and Shi said their best-selling items are rooftop units that provide hot water supply. These cost between 2,700 and 14,000 yuan ($400 and $2,060).

The purchases by households, offices and factories show that many urban residents have adequate disposable income, Johns Hopkins University researcher Curtis Melvin told AFP.

""Aside from a few high-profile cases, such as the increase in fuel prices in North Korea or temporary suspension of coal exports to China, we haven't seen much evidence that (previous) sanctions have had a tremendously negative effect on North Korea's economy,"" Melvin added.

- Dried ants -

Sino-US relations have soured as President Donald Trump has pressed Beijing to step up pressure on North Korea, complaining about their continuing trade.

In the first half, trade between China and North Korea increased 10.5 percent to $2.5 billion, compared to the same period last year.

The Chinese government has defended its trade with North Korea, noting that the UN sanctions do not apply to all commerce -- though AFP journalists recently visited Dandong shops that sold jewellery made with banned North Korean gold.

An array of goods flow both ways.

Shops along Dandong's waterfront offer North Korean ginseng, dried mushrooms and even dried ants, which are meant to be good for joint pain, according to traditional Chinese medicine.

Marc Lanteigne, senior lecturer at Massey University Center for Defence and Security Studies, said China has frequently ""drawn connections between peace-building and combating poverty, and stressed that complete economic isolation of North Korea is both counter-productive and dangerous."""
"Meet Faketoken, A New Android Malware Which Steals Your Data From Popular Cab-Hailing Apps","Next time you hail a taxi through a smartphone app, someone may be snooping on your activity.

A new modification of notorious mobile banking Trojan ""Faketoken"" has resurfaced which is able to steal credentials from popular taxi applications and ride-sharing apps, Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab said on Friday.

Representational Image

""The new version of 'Faketoken' performs live tracking of apps and, when the user runs a specified app, overlays this with its phishing window to steal the bank card details of the victim,"" Kaspersky Lab said in a statement.

The trojan virus has an identical interface, with the same colour schemes and logos, which creates an instant and completely invisible overlay.

""The fact that cybercriminals have expanded their activities from financial applications to other areas, including taxi and ride-sharing services, means that the developers of these services may want to start paying more attention to the protection of their users,"" said Viktor Chebyshev, security expert at Kaspersky Lab.

Representational Image

""The banking industry is already familiar with fraud schemes and tricks, and its previous response involved the implementation of security technologies in apps that significantly reduced the risk of theft of critical financial data,"" Chebyshev added.

According to Kaspersky Lab, the new version of ""Faketoken"" targets mostly Russian users but they believe the geography of attacks could easily be extended in the future.

The ""Faketoken"" modification steals all incoming SMS messages by redirecting them to its command and control servers, allowing criminals to get access to one-time verification passwords sent by a bank, or other messages sent by taxi and ride-sharing services.

Representational Image

Among other things, the malware also monitor users' calls, records them and transmits the data to the command and control servers.

Kaspersky researchers have also detected 'Faketoken' attacks on other popular mobile applications, such as travel and hotel booking apps, apps for traffic fine payments, Android Pay and the Google Play Market."

Fitter Pandey returns to familiar bridesmaidshire

• Last updated on Fri, 18 Aug, 2017, 09:36 PM Gokul Gopal in Dambulla

Pandey batted at No. 4 during his impressive 81-ball 104* against Australia in Sydney. © Getty

The rain was playing hide and seek with the Indian team during their practice session at the Rangiri Dambulla International stadium, two days ahead of the first ODI of the five-match series. The multiple interruptions was an irritant, especially for Manish Pandey. Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya were the first ones to bat, taking their turns in the three different nets, facing up against pace, spin and throw-downs. The next three that occupied the nets were skipper Virat Kohli, former captain MS Dhoni and India's latest No. 4 in the upcoming ODI series - KL Rahul. Waiting for his turn, Pandey was in a sombre mood and the rain didn't make things any better for the Karnataka right-hander.

Here he was, returning from an injury break and fresh off fruitful outings in the tri-nation series in South Africa featuring the 'A' teams. Pandey was keen to impress upon Ravi Shastri and the rest of the team-management that he was back and raring to go. The order that India followed while batting in the nets, more or less, summed up the potential batting order for the opening ODI. Dhawan and Rohit opening, Kohli at No. 3 and Rahul at 4. With Dhoni and Pandya slotted down, only one spot was remaining - No. 5.

That position appeared a direct toss up between Pandey, Ajinkya Rahane and Kedar Jadhav - who were the last set of batsmen to hit the nets on Friday (August 18). Rahane, the highest run-getter for India in the ODI series in the West Indies, appeared compact in the nets facing up against the pacers. Jadhav had his fair share of hits and misses against the spinners, and appeared to be enjoying his light-hearted banter with Yuzvendra Chahal.

Pandey, meanwhile, displayed a varied hue of emotions facing up against the slingy bullets from throw-down specialist - Raghavindraa. He grimaced whenever he missed the short deliveries outside-off, admonishing himself for every nick and miss, but at the same time oozed confidence driving on the up and flicking with disdain the deliveries that were strayed. All the while, Shastri was having a keen look at what was going on, focusing his attention on Pandey while keeping an eye on the rest batting in the two other nets. What was going through his mind, and through the minds of the ones literally batting for one spot?

More than a year back, an innings of 104 not-out against Australia brought Pandey into the spotlight. Leading his side over the line in a chase of 331, showcasing a steely nerve in a trying situation, Pandey's stocks rose as India had unearthed a player who would take up the No. 4 mantle. But a below-par series against New Zealand at home, batting lower down the order, resulted in Pandey no longer remaining part of the pecking order, and a side strain later putting paid to his Champions Trophy hopes.

""It's (injuries) really tough. Sometimes, when you are not in form it doesn't really hurt as much as when you're doing well and suddenly get injured. But I think you take it in the stride and that's the time when you get to learn what's the weak part of your body and where you have to work. I had enough time, about six weeks, to work on myself and a couple of things I had to do. It was good for me in a way but yeah, obviously a little disappointed about the time it happened but it's always good to come back. I had a good India A series; the team did really well, so I'm pretty happy.

""Honestly, I've waited a long time to come to the Indian side that I'm used to it now. IPL was going good for me - 10 games, about 400 runs - and then I missed those crucial two games. But it's part of the game, that's what you do (wait for your opportunity) and I've played the waiting game really well so far and it's okay for me. Whatever the management decides on the batting order, we would go with it,"" he adds.

With Rahul confirmed as the No. 4 batsman for the ODIs, Pandey will have to manage with whatever spot he's asked to bat at, only if he gets the nod ahead of Jadhav who can also offer his bits with the ball. Having batted at the No. 4 position for most parts of his career, an adjustment is the need of the hour for Pandey to stay relevant to the requirements of the Indian team, let alone cement a spot.

""The game I played in Australia, I batted No.4, that's where I normally bat, and that's where I know how many overs I have to play. That's where I have batted my entire career. Batting at No. 6 or No. 5 was a bit new for me during the New Zealand series, and I think it took me some time to get used to that situation with only 15-odd overs left in the game. You can't settle in from that position, you just need to go out and go at everything from ball one. I think I have adapted to that situation well. Let's see how it goes,"" says Pandey, reflecting on where things went downhill.

""That's where I bat (at No. 4), the middle-order. That's somewhere I have been batting for long time. But if the team thinks somebody else can do that role really well - KL has been batting really well in Tests - I would love to see that happen. It does change the middle order a little bit but that's just one or two changes. We agree with what the management has to say. We abide by that,"" he says, while remaining hopeful of getting a spot.

Waiting on the sidelines isn't anything new to Pandey, who's willing to go through the grind all over again. But being in the selectors' radar and getting sufficient time during practice sessions with the Indian team is proof of the confidence that the team has in the 27-year-old. How he repays the faith is a story that is yet to unfold.

All You Need To Know About The Exhilarating Jazzercise And Why It Can Burn A Hell Of A Lot Calories While You Have Fun!,"In a fitness industry-driven by the latest trends, a lot of us are devotees to the fancy moves that Zumba has to offer or the rigours that a CrossFit box puts you through. Indeed, the fitness industry has come a long way innovating itself through any opportunity it sees.

cincinnati.citymomsblog.com

Although fitness trends have come a long way since their inception there’s one that’s making a comeback with a bang. This blast from the past is called ‘Jazzercise’'! Originally a rage in the 80’s, around the time Jane Fonda made Aerobics synonymous with the word fitness with the video empire she created on it, it makes a strong re-appearance in it's newly outfitted lively variant.

Jazzercise all began as a “just for fun” warm-up of sorts

Judi Sheppard created Jazzercise while she was studying at the Northwestern University as a student when she saw a high number of dropout rates while she taught at a dance studio because the classes were too technical. Sheppard decided to turn the class from a technical to fun experience that included revolved around dance aerobics.

cdandlp.com

What initially started off as fitness classes that were designed “just for fun” to retain clients is now a full-blown hundred-million-dollar-per-year company that ranks in the top 50 franchise list in Entrepreneur with more than 8,000 franchisees in over 30 countries.

So what is Jazzercise all about?

remzavibes.com

It’s exactly what it sounds like jazz and exercise combined together. Back in the day, it used to be based on dance aerobics, while today Jazzercise boasts of multiple different elements. The classes integrate strength training using resistance tubes and weights helping women build muscle and bone density, boost metabolism, which helps them accelerate weight loss.

Is Jazzercise similar to Zumba?

mob.beautyme.meitu.com

The only thing that’s common between the two is the fact that they both combine dance with a component of exercise. The key difference is that Zumba primarily focuses on your cardiovascular fitness, while Jazzercise focuses on not just aerobics as well as strength training. Apart from moving around using dance are your central theme you will work on your entire body by even getting into strength training movements such as push-ups, bicep curl, crunches and so on.

Why is Jazzercise one of the most ass-kicking workout you can give yourself?

Jazzercise is a functional HIIT type workout. That means that unlike an activity like running or swimming to move in directions, it uses your body in ways that these activities cannot by working on different muscle groups, making it very functional and effective to improve your overall fitness. The constant acceleration and deceleration you put your body through ups your heart rate and burns up 600 calories or more in an hour.

Jazzercise is a great workout for your mind as well!

sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com

Every 10 weeks or so your instructor is most likely to shuffle in new music along with a variety of routines and steps to learn; forcing your mind to adapt and learn as you go. Learning new skills gives your memory a boost and betters your cognitive functioning—ensuring protection from mental deterioration over time.

Who is Jazzercise ideally best suited for?

trabajoendeporte.es

Well, if you’re someone who gets bored of performing the same moves or exercises repeatedly the progressive Jazzercise could be a format you might want to explore. If the dynamic style of training, the ever-evolving routines alongside varied music, meeting new people and being part of a community, and the fact that you get to get to learn a few dance-like moves while getting in a good workout excites you in anyway, you may want to consider a 60-minute class for starters."

"Selling LEDs at petrol pumps a major step in boosting oil companies’ non-fuel retail business: Pradhan, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government’s latest move to make LED bulbs and other energy-efficient appliances available for sale at petrol pumps will give a major fillip to oil companies ’ business arising from segments other than fuel retail, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.The retail fuel outlets of Oil Marketing Companies witness a total footfall of over 35 million every day. “In order to take advantage of this to enhance the non-fuel retail energy business, LED bulbs and other energy efficient appliances from EESL will be sold at ROs. The Ministry had recently taken the decision on daily pricing of fuel to prevent huge distortions in margins in the retail business. This step of selling LED bulbs will also help in the margins of retail outlets ,” Pradhan said.The minister was speaking at a ceremony marking an initial pact between the three OMCs – Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) – and Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) under the power ministry for selling of LED bulbs and other energy-efficient appliances at over 55,000 pumps across the country.Pradhan urged EESL and OMCs to develop a viable business model for the retail outlets in the next six months. The oil companies will help in branding and marketing of the UJALA Scheme – the government’s flagship initiative to promote LED bulbs -- at all their retail outlets thereby making petrol pumps attractive to customers. “The RO dealers will directly conduct business with EESL and would get around 10 per cent margin,” Pradhan said.The OMCs have been tying up with other stakeholders, too, to develop their non-fuel retail business at retail outlets. A pilot launch of tie-up with Mother Dairy Safal outlets has been carried out in Bhubaneshwar in Odisha under which customers are expected to get fresh and quality vegetables and fruits at affordable rates at the petrol stations.BPCL has also entered into a tie-up with In & Out retail chain at their ROs. HPCL is also in the process of tying up with retail chains of the market to expand their business at ROs. Pradhan said the Janaushadhi Stores under the Department of Pharmaceuticals under the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers will also be opened at ROs in the future.Apart from this, Common Service Centre (CSC) concept of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is also being explored to be brought to the petrol pumps. Under CSC, citizens will be able to avail many Government-to-Citizen and Business-to-Citizen services including PAN, E-Aadhaar Cards, utility bill Payments, banking solutions and Agri Services."

But Sreesanth now has a different story. In an interview with Wisden, he explains why he tucked in the towel.

""They said Jiju (Janardhan) apparently said I would either keep an armband or towel or vermilion or something like that. I used to do all that because I love Allan Donald.”

“I have done that before too. I would even wear plenty of zinc oxide on my face, like Donald. Does that mean those matches were fixed too? Is it a crime to be superstitious? I believed that wearing those things would help me when I was going through a bad phase in my bowling. In fact, in the first over I asked Kumar Dharmasena (the umpire) if it was okay if I kept a towel. Surely, the stump microphones picked that up. I did that only because it made me feel like Donald.”

As of now, Sreesanth is looking forward to representing India in the 2019 World Cup."

"States take over Rs 2 lakh crore debt of power discoms under UDAY scheme, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: States participating in the government’s Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana ( UDAY ) scheme have taken over the targeted debt of Rs. 2.09 lakh crore of their distribution firms, the power ministry said in a statement.The states have taken over the debt under the borrowing exemption from the Fiscal Responsibility & Budget Management (FRBM) Act given in UDAY for the previous two financial years.“The process of states taking over the targeted debts and issuing them as state development loans ( SDL ) bonds has now been completed. As of now, the participating DISCOMs have to issue bonds worth approximately Rs 37,000 crore,” the statement said. It added since the rest of the debt with discoms is mostly in the nature of capital expenditure debt it is not required to be taken over by the states.Participating DISCOMs have achieved net savings of approximately Rs. 15,000 crore till March, 2017 under the scheme. ”In the participating states, the Average Cost of Supply (ACS) - Average Revenue Realized (ARR) gaps has come down by almost 14 paise per unit and the AT&C losses have reduced by almost 1 percent in financial years 2016-17,”the statement said.As per the provisions of the UDAY Scheme, which has completed one year, the states would start taking over losses of DISCOMs in a graded manner from now on, starting with taking over 5 percent of the losses of 2016-17 from the current financial year."

"Roving surgical robot to tour four key Andhra Pradesh cities, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Visakhapatnam: Cancer is a relentless disease. Damaging organs and tissues in its wake, cancer can be insidious in its onset, hiding malignant cells and tumours in the most unreachable parts of the body.

Early detection is a daunting challenge. Once detected, patients find it hard to accept its presence spending time in exploring alternative methods to banish cancer.

Eventually calling for surgery, medication and a combination of radiation and chemotherapy.

But there is one hope on the horizon for sufferers of this most devastating of conditions. Robotic surgery methods can allow for hugely magnified views of the damaged tissue and provide very fine and precise instruments needed to get access to them inside the body and bring relief.

The da Vinci robot is no autonomous machine, performing surgery on a helpless patient with minimal interference from the surgeon. In fact, a trained surgeon is in charge every second of the way.

The da Vinci surgical robot that combines the best of science and medicine, is a whole 1000 kilos of hardware. Its brains are equivalent to software packed in several PCs. It includes 2250 plus patents with 1550 more pending and so is filled to the brim with innovation. What the robot adds is a way of seeing better and four flexible arms that enter the human body through tiny incisions can be guided to make the repair needed. It is the next breakthrough step in minimally invasive surgery and a major step up from laparoscopic procedures.

Dr T Subramanyeshwar Rao, Medical Director and Chief Surgical Oncologist, Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital, Hyderabad says, ""The distinct advantages of robotic assistance are high resolution 3-dimensional visuals and 10-fold magnification, wristed instruments with seven degrees of freedom of movement, filtration of tremors of surgeon's hands and motion scaling to suit the speed and experience of a surgeon.""

When working with a da Vinci, the surgeon, a specialist not only in the use of the machine but also in her own field of surgery, sits at a console controlling the robotic arms and sending the right instrument to remove or repair tissue. Because it is so precise, there is less chance of collateral damage. And since the cuts and incisions needed to send the robotic arms are so tiny, the patient doesn't have to suffer the trauma of traditional open surgery. A huge relief to just about anyone. It means negligible blood loss, less pain, quick recovery and shorter hospital stay.

Spelling out advantages of Robotic Surgery over laparoscopic surgery Dr C. Mallikarjuna, Managing Director and Senior Urologist, Asian Institute of Nephrology and Urology, Hyderabad says, ""Laparoscopic surgery is an extremely difficult field to practice. To perfect you need a lot of training, mentorship, and clinical practice. To excel it needs a lot of time and perseverance. da Vinci Robot makes that learning curve easy so that the expertise can come earlier. It literally means technology helps you get better in shorter time.""

Robotic surgery works best in areas involving soft tissue. It is certainly proving better than traditional surgery in many gynaecological cancers, head, and neck and thoracic surgery, removal of organs such as the kidney, liver, pancreas, thyroid, prostate, and uterus, urology ailments and even organ transplants. Robotic surgery is also being used more and more for paediatric patients. In this form of surgery, suturing is flawless.

The Vattikuti Foundation, Vattikuti Technologies and Intuitive Surgical Inc. have instituted a 'Roving Robot' project in which the surgical robot is being taken around the country for surgeons, hospital managements and local physicians to touch and feel a Surgical Robot and listen to one of the accomplished robotic surgeons in the country to share her experience and the benefits to patients.

""The 'Roving Robot' will help surgeons experience the capabilities of a da Vinci surgical robot in removing cancerous tissue while retaining healthy tissue,"" says Gopal Chakravarthy, CEO, Vattikuti Technologies that distributes the da Vinci robot created by US-based Intuitive Surgical Inc., USA.

The Vattikuti Foundation and Vattikuti Technologies have helped expand robotic surgery to 47 hospitals in 20 Indian cities, in the past six years, while creating a ground swell of trained robotic surgeons. Vattikuti Foundation began promoting Robotic Surgery in the US in 1997 and has since played a stellar role in spreading it across the USA, Europe, and India.

In the next leg of its country-wide march, the Roving Robot is Southward bound to four cities in Andhra Pradesh. The da Vinci will be showcased in Vishakhapatnam (Care Hospital Aug 18; Apollo Hospital Health City, Arilova, Aug 19; Pinnacle Hospital Health City, Arilova Aug 21-22), in Rajahmundry (GSL Medical College, Aug 26), Vijayawada (Prashanth Hospital Aug 28, Aayush Hospital Aug 29 and Ramesh Hospital Aug 30) and in Tirupati (SVIMS Sep 2-3).

Eminent surgical-oncologist Dr Jagdishwar Goud from Hyderabad's Yashoda Hospital will highlight the benefits of robotic surgery in an interactive session with surgeons from Vishkhapatnam and neighbouring towns on Aug 23.

Vattikuti Technologies and surgical robot maker Intuitive Surgical Inc., USA will offer hospitals the da Vinci robot along with instruments and maintenance required for the next three years at a special price point.

Currently, Andhra Pradesh has surgical robots at Apollo Hospital, Asian Institute of Nephrology & Urology, Basavatarakam Indo American Hospital, Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences and Yashoda Hospital in Hyderabad and Vizag Hospital and Cancer Institute in Vishakhapatnam.

Part of the Foundation's mission is also to offer 100 paid fellowships to super specialist surgeons, over the next five years, so they can become robotic surgeons. In this, they are making good progress. Vattikuti Foundation also organizes Robotic Surgeons conference every six months.

At the recent Robotic Surgeons' conferences hosted by the Foundation, over 100-125 robotic surgeons participated and shared their experience and techniques with others to encourage further appropriate use of this form of surgery.

Vattikuti Technologies has been making available da Vinci Robotic Surgery System from Intuitive Surgical Inc., USA. The da Vinci Surgery is considered the gold standard in minimally invasive surgery.

In 2016, over 750,000 procedures were performed worldwide using over 4000 da Vinci robotic surgical systems world-wide. The da Vinci system has brought about a paradigm shift by making it possible to have almost all complex procedures done with minimal access. Over 4 million da Vinci procedures have been carried out so far.

Since 2011 Vattikuti Technologies has partnered with several hospitals in drawing a roadmap for success of the robotic program as well as supporting training of surgeons besides ensuring high uptime for the system through its trained clinical support and service team.

Large corporate hospitals; Government hospitals and Trust hospitals in 20 Indian cities are using the da Vinci Surgical Robots. (ANI-Businesswire India)"
"GlaxoSmithKline: Pharma reps should be motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than sales: Annaswamy Vaidheesh, GSK, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Vice President,, VP, South Asia & Managing Director, India,Pharmaceuticals, talks about the importance of code of ethics in healthcare industry. Edited excerpts:GSK as part of their global values believes in the concept of a patient- centric approach to doing business. Most of the decisions that GSK has been taking and will be taking in the future is always towards the patient. One of the areas we felt is that the sales people- they are the frontline people who are interacting with doctors and play a very big role in transferring knowledge to our doctors.At the end of the day, the patient gets the treatment done if the doctor is knowledgeable and well- endowed with the right approach to treating the disease. After a long research, we found out that the behaviour of the sales reps play a very big role. One of the areas that we decided to incentivize and change is the behaviour of our frontline sales people; to recognise them on lead indicators rather than on the lag indicators. Sales is a lag indicator; the lead indicators are the kind of knowledge the rep is ready or is well versed with; how well he or she communicates the knowledge to the doctor and how well he pursues the doctors to use the knowledge in making a well- informed decision.That is the reason why GSK decided to remove the sales target, on a global basis. We don’t want them to be focusing on lag and instead we decided to recognise them on the lead indicators. Now we have put a fixed system in place where they can be recognised and motivated to focus on knowledge transfer rather than focusing on sales which is far more mundane.I think what the National Health Policy has done is fantastic. Healthcare financing is a very important component of a good healthcare system and is followed in most parts of the world. Only in India the healthcare financing is very small when compared to the financing by the other forces rather than the patient himself or herself paying out of pocket. Having 70-75% of the expenses as out-of-pocket, in my opinion, is not a right approach to managing healthcare in a country where the patients tend to sub-optimally purchase healthcare if he/she has to pay out-of-pocket.So what the Government is trying to do is to put the money in the hands of the people who want to consume healthcare so that when the patient is in a compromised state, either physically or emotionally, the person should not be worrying about finance and in fact be worrying about how he is going to get well rather than finding out how am I going to get the money to take care of my health.I think the Government has done a fantastic job, particularly the poor people below the poverty line, will get addressed. However, the middle- class population of the country is the one which is sandwiched- where their aspirations are high- educating their children or wanting to move up the social ladder. And one episode of healthcare will put them back, in terms of bankruptcy. So if we or the Government can come up with an innovative insurance programme where minimum INR 50,000 insurance cover can be given by the Government of India by partnering with various insurance companies, because, if they integrate the demand of 200 billion middle class people, the insurance can be purchased very cheap to the extent of 300-400 INR p.a. and that can be given to the middle class population so that even if they want to top up they can or should be able to add on whatever they want to add up to say INR 1 lakh or INR 2 lakhs of extra insurance cover. So, I believe that somewhere down the line we need to take care of the middle- class population of this country through our insurance programme.But what the Government has done for the lower strata of the society or the people with limited resources, I think has been well addressed. I would encourage the Government to take care of the middle- class population of this country that is bulging quite a bit in size as we go forward.Our new CEO Ms Emma Walmsley, in her own right, is an outstanding leader. She has a phenomenal track record of being a great leader within GSK and outside also. It so happens that she also represents the gender which is not well represented in the boardroom. To that extent she sets an example.Her strategic approach to driving the growth agenda of the company; her focus on innovation; her focus on performance and building the reputation of the company, are the key thoughts that she has been driving through the early parts of her time as CEO.We believe that GSK is in for a good decade of great leadership under Ms Emma Walmsley and she can be an inspiring leader just not for women but also for the men who want to learn a lot of leadership lessons.I am quite sure that most companies have some form of an ethical code. What is important is that we are part of the ecosystem which is supporting the doctor and patient. And being a responsible member in the ecosystem, we should make sure that we don’t interfere in this very pure, nice and holy approach to patient care. If we start dwindling around with the decision making of the doctor and what treatment to give, what drugs to give, what medical process that the patient has to follow, the patient will get compromised.So, the way in which we execute our code of conduct is to make sure that what we say and the way we follow, is well implemented and we spare no chance for anyone to not follow the code of conduct. So, implementation of the code is important, in GSK we strongly believe that if anybody does not follow the code of conduct we take a great offence to their behaviour. Even if their sales performance or business performance is good but if their ethics are compromised we do not allow them to continue with our company. So that’s the kind of standard we keep, ourselves.At the end of the day, the patient is important. The doctors’ well- informed decision related to patient treatment is very important to us and that is why we pride ourselves as being a good executer of the code of conduct."
Why Skipping Breakfast Makes Your Child Undernourished,"If your child is in the habit of skipping breakfast regularly he or she may be falling well short of the daily required amounts of nutrients that are essential for their growth and development, claim the researchers of a recent study.

Reuters/representational image

The findings showed that 31.5 per cent of children who skipped breakfast did not meet even the lower recommended nutrient intake (LRNI) of iron.

While 19 per cent did not meet LRNI for calcium, 21.5 per cent did not meet lower levels of iodine and 7.3 per cent had a folate intake below their recommended nutrient intake level.

Reuters/representational image

On the other hand, children who ate breakfast every day were found to have higher daily intakes of key nutrients such as folate—important for the development of genetic material–, calcium, iron and iodine—key in the development of thyroid function.

“This study provides evidence that breakfast is key for parents to ensure that their children are getting the nutrition they need,” said Gerda Pot, a lecturer at the King’s College London.

For the study, published in the British Journal of Nutrition, the team included 802 children aged from four to 10 years and 884 children aged 11 to 18 years.

Reuters/representational image

Breakfast was considered as consumption of over 100 calories between 6 and 9 a.m.

The study also showed that, in younger children (four to 10 years old), on days when breakfast was consumed, children had higher intakes of folate, calcium, vitamin C and iodine compared to their breakfast-skipping days.

Out of these same nutrients, for older children (11-18 years old) only calcium intakes were higher on breakfast-consuming days.

Seventy Years Of Freedom?,"Jesus taught that true freedom is to experience mukti within, writes DANIEL THEJUS





The idea of freedom resonates with the idea of release — to be free. It has been 70 years since India became independent.The shackles of the British Raj fell.We have achieved release in one very important sense. However, have we experienced release internally? We are tangled by several pressures. The pressure at work to prove yourself. The pressure to live up to your neighbour’s standards. Somehow ‘comfort zone’ has become a bad thing. In other words, we are all seeking happiness by running away from it the moment we find it. Dissatisfaction, the enemy of contentment, thrusts us further into this quagmire. This bondage that we experience excuses us of all our real responsibilities and somehow justifies a life lived purely for ourselves. In the midst of all this pressure, we have forgotten our dharma. We have forgotten our responsibility to family, society and in turn to ourselves.When everyone begins to forget their duty to one another,we end up living in a fractured world. Submersed in a world that is fractured, we do not know any better. Nevertheless, we realise something is amiss and we seek freedom.There is an unseen pull towards release from this selfish monotony. Now,instead of looking for release at the end of our life’s journey, it is possible to experience it within the monotonous struggles of daily life. Jesus offers us a solution he says we can experience in the here and now.We can experience death and rebirth every day. This experience of death and rebirth in the here and now purifies us and eventually releases us into eternity.



He says,‘until a seed falls into the ground and dies it will never live again.’ Jesus invites us into him to experience death, rebirth and release within our lifetime. We can enjoy rest in the present moment.And living every moment restfully is to live eternally. The logic that Jesus is propounding is practical. His invitation should not strike us as strange, we see it happening all the time in the plant world. He is now asking us to experience what Mother Nature knows all too well.Like a plant we have to die in order that we might live again.If we refuse to die, we will remain dead. If we accept this death,we will live again. If the seed is the ‘I’,the soil into which it is buried is God — the ultimate reality.When the self is buried in the divine; divinity surrounds it,nurtures it and nourishes it.What sprouts out is a renewed life with new motivations,new possibilities and a spark of divinity reignited in us.The first attempt of this process might be the hardest but consecutive procedures will be motivated by the positive love that we experienced with the divine. This experience sets us free.We will experience mukti internally and to offer this to others becomes our dharma.This experience of freedom makes us: Responsible citizens of this world;love our neighbour and enemy as ourselves,renders every moment as joy despite unhappy circumstances; brings the Divine closer than we expected — into us.■

"Concerns over stalled hydro power projects despite bailout plan, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Kolkata: Despite a proposed bailout plan for the hydro power sector, concerns remain on the roll-out of the stalled hydro power projects, an official of the Central Electricity Authority said.

""Uncertainty remains about success even with the proposed bailout package due to various factors. So, we are currently targeting at projects which are in advanced stage say 70-80 per cent complete,"" the Central Electricity Authority official told .

There had been decline in interest from private investors in the hydro power projects given environmental hurdles, better alternatives like solar power, tariff of which has plummeted drastically to below Rs 3 a unit, sources said.

RP Sanjiv Goenka group chairman Sanjiv Goenka had recently said they will not pursue new hydro projects and will review their existing hydro projects highlighting numerous hurdles.

There are some 14 stalled hydro power projects in the country involving 10,000 MW with around Rs 26,000 crore in these projects.

Beside offering fiscal benefits, the government was contemplating to offer 'renewable' status to all hydro power projects irrespective of their size in the proposed bailout plan.

The percentage of hydro power has come down from 45 per cent in 1970 to 14 per cent in 2016 which is too less to have an efficient and balanced grid for operation, the sources added. BSM RG"

"Invest in R&D of e-cars, not imports","The Centre has invited global bids for 10,000 electric cars for use by government departments in the national capital region. We certainly need to accelerate usage of electric vehicles. However, the best way to spend money to this end is in solid research in battery technology, new materials to make car bodies lighter and stronger, self-driving technology and other subsystems, with the aim of securing for Indian industry a sizeable presence in the new breed of automobiles that would replace the traditional car.

Policy is needed to speedily replace the internal combustion engine, given to energy-wasting environmental damage, besides to breakdowns.

For India, the petroleum fuel in such engines is mostly imported, at huge and rising costs. Their replacement with electricity, even if generated with coal, would both save foreign exchange and use up less energy overall.

However, e-vehicles would mean massive societal and business dislocation, and total transformation of the huge auto ancillary sector. What’s required is proactive policy that enables the thriving auto ancillary clusters pan-India to have the chance to reconfigure their products and services for e-vehicles, or find entirely new niches of demand.

The conventional automobile engine has umpteen parts and ancillaries, which need to be regularly serviced, overhauled and repaired, providing a large employment opportunity.

e-Vehicles, with far fewer parts, would disrupt today’s auto sector. The projection is that e-vehicle usage will see exponential growth early in the next decade.

Already, one global auto major has announced that two-thirds of its cars would be electric or hybrids by 2020. The auto industry here needs gearing up as well. And the change must be driven by indigenous capacity, built through research."
"Bengaluru reports 37% of dengue cases in Karnataka, Health News, ET HealthWorld","(Representative image)

BENGALURU: The city seems to be in a viral grip of dengue -every third person who tests positive for dengue in Karnataka is from Bengaluru. The city has seen 4,280 dengue cases since January this year. That's 36.9% of the total dengue cases reported across Karnataka -11,610 as of August 16, 2017.Alarmed by the spurt in dengue cases, a team of experts from the Union health ministry is currently on a visit in the state. They are taking stock of the public health scenario, especially that of vector-borne diseases and their control measures. The team visited a private hospital in north Bengaluru on Saturday and had been to Tumakuru on Friday.The numbers, however, haven't shaken the BBMP even a bit. According to BBMP chief medical officer (public health) Dr Lokesh MN, the number of dengue cases in Bengaluru should be analysed in the context of the city's population. “Detecting 4,280 dengue cases for a population of one crore in eight months is not an alarming data. We have taken precautions to prevent mosquito breeding through household surveys and the same has been explained to the central team. There is no need to panic,“ Dr Lokesh said.With 1,262 cases, east zone has seen the highest dengue incidence in the city.Hospitals in Bengaluru have so far handled 969 dengue cases referred from neighbouring districts and taluks for treatment. Even as BBMP health officials remain in a denial mode on the high incidence of dengue cases in Bengaluru, hospitals in the city are seeing a steady rise in the number of patients seeking treatment for viral illnesses. Some of the multi-speciality hospitals admitted that since the beds are always full, they are forced to refer patients with dengue-like symptoms to other hospitals.“We get no less than 60 patients with viral illnesses every day. At least twenty beds are always occupied by patients with dengue-like illnesses. These numbers are unusually high. In fact, half of the calls I get every day are requests for a hospital bed for suspected dengue patients,“ said Dr H Sudarshan Ballal , chairman, Manipal hospitals . “It's not the hour for blame game. The government, doctors and the public have to work together to curb the mosquito menace,“ Dr Ballal reminded. At Manipal, 10% of the total beds are currently filled with patients with dengue-like symptoms.M S Ramaiah Hospital is handling at least 10-15 viral infection cases daily in its outpatient blocks. “There is certainly a rise in the number of viral fever cases and certainly not all would be dengue. Most of our hospital beds are allocated to people suffering from dengue-like illnesses,“ said Dr Naresh Shetty, president, Ramaiah Hospital.Currently, it's impossible to draw a parallel with last year's dengue incidence since the BBMP doesn't have a comprehensive number explaining the 2016 scenario. “Last year, during August, we witnessed only 91 cases through NIV centres.The reportage of dengue from most city hospitals was not regular and many hospitals did not have the access or avoided informing BBMP about positive dengue cases,“ claimed BBMP chief medical officer (public health) Dr Lokesh M N. “This year, the number of cases appears to be more because of the higher reportage of dengue from all city hospitals and also because of a new software that we have launched, enabling hospitals to update the number of dengue patients admitted or diagnosed.“Tackling dengue is not rocket science. We know the cause and we know the preventive measures that need to be taken. Yet, the disease strikes with alarming regularity and Bengaluru city has had a high number of cases this year. While there obviously needs to be prevention at the individual and family level, the BBMP and health department must ensure fumigation of stagnant pools of water and open drains, which are potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes, is done regularly. The debilitating effects of dengue can be long-lasting but there seems to be no urgency to put an end to this menace."

Battle over quit India: Modi boisterously appropriates what Congress believes to be its family heirloom,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been thinking on his feet, as it were, on the issue of hitching his party to the bandwagon of freedom struggle. He is celebrating, with all the fervour that he can muster, the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement of 1942, the 70th anniversary of India’s independence, and he is planning grand celebrations for the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019 and the 75th anniversary of India’s independence in 2022.

It has become clear by now that Modi believes hugely in atmospherics. The main opposition party, Congress, feels left out and more than a little peeved by the PM’s boisterous appropriation of the freedom struggle, which the grand old party of India believes to be its family heirloom.

Congress leaders have always been contemptuous of the Hindu right-wing and they have forever taunted their ideological adversaries for having never taken part in the freedom struggle. Of course, the charge is unfair in historical terms. There were many who did not believe in the politics of agitation popularised by Mahatma Gandhi from 1920 onwards which placed the Congress party in the lead position, but who had been looking at other ways of gaining independence from British suzerainty.

The Muslim League was never part of the agitational approach of Gandhi’s Congress, and neither were many other sections like the Zamindars, the Unionist Party in Punjab, the Justice Party in the Madras presidency and the Krishak Samaj Party in Bengal. One of the prominent leaders who did not accept Gandhi’s extra-constitutional approach was BR Ambedkar.

So, if the case is to be argued as to whether people who did not court prison and raise anti-British slogans did not fight for freedom from the British, then it would be an argument that would be difficult to sustain. There were different political groups and each dealt with the British keeping in mind what they believed to be their own interests. There is little doubt that Congress had a broader viewpoint than all the others put together. It claimed to speak for the whole country, for all the groups and all the regions. The others contested the Congress claim to be representing all.

This was specially so in the case of Muslim League. The Hindu right-wingers were indeed in a quandary because they could not say that Congress did not represent the Hindu majority. As a matter of fact, the League dubbed the Congress as the party of the Hindus. There was no room in the arena for other Hindu sectional interests. Hindu Mahasabha leaders like MR Jayakar and Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya continued to exert influence in Congress. In a way, communal Hindu elements found a voice within Congress. Nehru and others were aware of this and greatly resented their presence.

Modi has turned the argument over whether one participated in the freedom struggle on its head by asserting that present day India ruled by BJP derives inspiration from the 1942 Quit India Movement to transform India. In contrast, all that Congress president Sonia Gandhi could bring herself to say was that it was Jawaharlal Nehru who had moved the Quit India resolution on August 9, 1942. Sonia was clutching a twig of history, while Modi took upon himself the burden of carrying the spirit of Quit India Movement, at least by way of rhetoric, to transform India of today.

Congress has now been reduced to a party which clings to memories of the past, invoking its heroism of long ago to seek solace in its bleak present and infuriated by the Modi strategy of appropriating the heritage of the freedom movement for BJP with much panache. It can be said that Modi’s words and gestures sound hollow because he does not really believe in the Gandhian morality of loving the adversary. And most importantly, he is not able to come to terms with Gandhi’s proclaimed political heir, Nehru.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee had no hesitation in looking up to the Nehruvian legacy because Vajpayee had greater self-confidence than Modi does. The prime minister’s belligerence in what he says and what he does not say betrays a brittle sense of his own self. But he is moving in the right direction by acknowledging loudly and clearly events like the Quit India Movement which was essentially a Congress ploy.

It can be seen in retrospect that the Quit India Movement was a historical blunder because the Muslim League and others became stronger between 1942 and 1945. Many Congress leaders, including Nehru, were not comfortable with Gandhi’s decision. Though it was a tactical blunder, Gandhi was right in going ahead with it because all the Congress leaders were imprisoned, and when they came out of prison at the end of the war, they were burnished heroes who had paid the price for refusing to go with the British war effort.

But no Congress leader of the day ever showed any resentment towards the bureaucracy, towards the Indian armed forces who participated in World War II, nor with the industrialists and many others from different walks of life who were not in the Quit India Movement. Congress in 1945 carried everyone else with it. Modi seems to be trying to appropriate the legacy of the freedom struggle with barely a nod towards Congress. Congress’s anger is palpable."
IIT Madras Builds Particle Detector On Campus To Help CERN Unravel The Mysteries Of Dark Matter,"Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-M) is setting up an exclusive centre on its premises for research, and to develop a silicon tracker detector that will go into upgrading the massive 14,000 tonne CMS (compact muon solenoid) detector, which is studying a wide range of physics including the dark matter that makes up the universe.

IITM

The CMS detector is installed by CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, in France.

The dedicated Silicon Detector Research and Development and Application Centre to be set up at IIT Madras at a cost of Rs 6 crore, will be part of India-CMS collaboration. The Centre is expected to be operational by end of 2018.

“The main purpose of this centre is to work with other Indian collaborating institutes to build a ‘2000 silicon detector module’ that will be part of the CMS detector at CERN,” said Prafulla Kumar Behera, associate professor, department of physics, IIT-Madras.

Representational Image

The main CMS detector in France will undergo upgradation in 2025 when the existing silicon tracker detector dies out. The silicon tracker detector is one of the four subdetectors in the main CMS detector. Data from the main detector installed 100m below ground may help scientists understand the evolution of the universe better.

Prof Behera said the centre not only aims at conducting cutting-edge research with advanced machine tools but will also train students in the process. “IIT-Madras is also offering summer internships at CERN for our undergraduate students since 2015,” he said.

Scientists said the sensor that goes into the detector a technology for which is available only in a few countries has several potential spinoff applications like medical imaging that can help the Indian healthcare sector. “If we could get such technologies, may be in the future we can use them if we are going to build such detectors in our country,” Behera said.

IIT-M became the first IIT to be made a full member of the CMS experiment at CERN in 2014. India became as associate member of CERN in 2016.

One Man Is A Serious Threat To Sachin Tendulkar's Record Of Most Runs In Tests And That Is Alastair Cook,"When Sachin Tendulkar hung up his boots, his final tally of Test runs was 15,921.

AFP

Four years on he still holds the records for the most runs in the format, but one man is closing in. That person is none other then England's opening mainstay Alastair Cook.

Cook is currently on 11,478 and needs 4444 to go past Sachin.

AFP

Certain factors are in his favour. The southpaw has the highest run-getter among active Test players. The man is in good form, and at 32 has a lot of time on his side. Not to mention the fact England play around 15 Tests a year which gives him all the more opportunity.

Cook only plays Test cricket as he is no longer part of the shorter versions for quite some time now. This means he has more time to focus on his game and in the next four to five years could easily go past the Master Blaster.

AFP

Of course there is still a long way to go. Variables like fitness issues, injury or dip in form may come into play. While time will determine if he breaks Sachin's record, he is, for the moment, certainly a threat.

"Pradhan meets Odisha CM Patnaik to resolve Paradip refinery tax issue, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today met Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik here and discussed an ongoing tax issue between Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ), the nation’s largest fuel retailer, and the state government over the latter withdrawing tax incentives provided for setting up the Paradip refinery project in 2004.“Discussion happened in positive environment and both sides displayed the willingness to come to a mutually benefitting and agreeable solution,” Pradhan said in a tweet following the meet.The Odisha government had in February this year sent a notice to IOC stating it is withdrawing the promised 11-year tax deferment on payment of sales tax on Paradip refinery products sold in the state.The state government had originally offered the tax incentives to IOC and its then partner Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) in December 1998 to invest in setting up a refinery in the state. These investments were withdrawn in February 2000, leading to the company shelving the project.The state later restored the incentives and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with IOC in February 2004 for providing a set of eight sops. The state government had reportedly withdrawn the tax incentives in ""public interest"", citing 6-year delay in commissioning of the project that was larger in capacity than originally planned 9 million tonne plant.IOC, however, pointed out the February 2004 MoU clearly allowed change in design, capacity and configuration of the project and that the Odisha government was informed about the change in capacity and the delay in construction caused by cyclone, land acquisition and law and order problems, according to a report.As per the MoU, IOC was to commission the refinery in 2009, but actually did it in November 2015 and the state government allowed IOC to avail of construction-related sops totalling Rs 550 crore all through the six years.The foundation stone of the Paradip refinery was originally laid by the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in May 2000."
"Mission possible: A new India: PM is using India’s high-quality, low-cost technology to lift 400 million out of poverty by 2022","On 15 February this year, Isro placed 104 satellites into orbit using only a single launch of one vehicle, PSLV-C37. The video of the event, available easily enough on the net, shows the familiar zoom of a rocket entering space, and then little flicks chase one another into the deep distance until the mission is completed. Only three satellites were Indian; 96 were commissioned by two American companies, Planet Laks and Spire Global.

The acceleration in space, impressive as it is, might be less spectacular than the change taking place on the ground. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has initiated a transformation towards a new India in which historic burdens such as poverty and corruption have been eliminated, and inheritance ills like communalism and casteism are only bad memory. His mission has a calendar; the deadline is 2022, when India celebrates its 75th year of independence.

Transformative change needs radical thinking. The economic empowerment of women is being used as a principal cure for poverty. Under Mudra, the PM’s signature project for those at the base of the economic pyramid, loans worth Rs 3,55,590 crore have been disbursed. Remarkably, 78% of those taking these loans are women.

The PM’s housing plan, for the impoverished, is an equally big story in gender emancipation. A woman can take this home loan as sole owner; but a man needs a woman as co-owner unless he is a widower or bachelor. This is a fundamental shift in the balance of power within a family. Over 25 million women who thought that a gas cylinder was a privilege of the middle class or rich, are now in smokeless kitchens. Swachh Bharat is a means to dignity and better health for women. The list is long.

The objective is to lift about 400 million out of harsh poverty in five years by ensuring that the first fruits and largest share of economic growth go to those who need it most. In a complementary initiative, the PM is using India’s proven capability in high-quality, low-cost technology to create efficient, sustainable and corruption-free delivery systems for direct benefits to the poor on an unprecedented scale.

Jan Dhan was an essential first step. In 2015, within three months, banks opened 300 million accounts for those who had never crossed the doors of a bank before. Critics sneered that these were “cashless”. Unsurprisingly, they had missed the point: banks were now serving those without money, rather than those with.

Use of technology for transparency has also become mandatory in the bidding process for government contracts. In a country where, particularly during the long decade between 2004 and 2014, contracts became synonymous with corruption, the change is a virtual revolution, leaving sections of the old political-industrial complex frustrated, angry and desperate to restore the previous order.

New India is being fashioned from embers of the old. Sceptics who cannot fathom why Narendra Modi has become the most popular PM in memory need look no further than his comprehensive assault on poverty and corruption.

It surely cannot be anyone’s case that through some twirl of a magic wand, India should suddenly become free of all ills. Among our difficult legacies is the politics of Hindu-Muslim differences, a tragedy that has simmered and often bubbled into conflict. One long-standing dispute has been over the cow, held sacred in Hinduism. Mahatma Gandhi urged an end to cow slaughter; and the lead architect of our Constitution, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, included this as a guiding tenet of our Constitution. Beef was banned in most states by Congress governments.

Of late, cow vigilantes have attacked Muslims and Dalits on suspicion of eating or transporting beef. Two incidents attracted wide, and understandable, media coverage: of Pehlu Khan in Rajasthan and Junaid in Haryana.

No government can prevent crime. A government’s bona fides are tested by what it does in pursuit of the criminal. In Rajasthan, seven suspects have been charged with murder. The state’s chief minister Vasundhara Raje has dismissed as malicious the allegation that her administration was biased and argued the same in this newspaper, in an oped piece headlined ‘Mob violence is unacceptable’ (27 July). Comparisons are not an answer, but she pointed out that murders and mob violence took a higher tally in Rajasthan in 2012, when Congress was in power. In Haryana, five were arrested but the main suspect escaped. Police traced him to Sakri, in Maharashtra, where he thought he had found safety in obscurity. He has now confessed to stabbing Junaid.

On 29 June, PM Modi expressed his anguish during the centenary event of Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, wondering how much pain Gandhi himself would have felt. Gandhi had offered to die for the cow, but never advocated violence in its name. Finance minister Arun Jaitley has described the incidents as barbaric.

Both voters and politicians are increasingly dismissive of the motivated and fraying narrative of extended guilt. Nitish Kumar, for instance, refused to buy this false propaganda of Congress, whose only electoral crutch now is the alleged insecurity of minorities.

In 2013, there was an assassination attempt on Narendra Modi during a rally in Patna. At that critical, volatile moment, he said that Hindus and Muslims had a choice: they could either fight each other, or they could unite to fight the true enemy, poverty. Fraternity and prosperity of all Indians is the only creed of Narendra Modi."

Bruised and battered, Windies stare at a steep learning curve

• Last updated on Sun, 20 Aug, 2017, 02:55 AM Rob Johnston in Birmingham

Jermaine Blackwood was the only bright spark in a forgettable batting display for WI. © Getty

It was a catastrophic third day at Edgbaston for the Windies. Ill-disciplined and lacking in both skill and fight, the tourists were outgunned by a far stronger England team. The visitors lost 19 wickets, a feeble batting display to go with their slapdash bowling in the first innings. It has not been good watching.

Nor has their capitulation been a surprise. The Windies are ranked eighth in the world in Test cricket and England are third. The men from the Caribbean have not won a Test series since 2014 and have won just five Tests away from home in the last ten years, three of which came against Bangladesh before the Asian side's recent improvement. It has been a long time - too long - since West Indies were a Test match force.

The current group to don the maroon caps are young and inexperienced. They have just one player, Kraigg Brathwaite, who has played more than 100 first-class games. In contrast, only one player, Toby Roland-Jones, has not reached the three-figure mark for England. Just two of this Windies team have played Test cricket in England before and six of them have played 12 Tests or less.

Which makes their performance in this match, as disappointing as it was, somewhat understandable. The players are learning the game at the highest level, trying to compete against seasoned internationals when they barely know their own games. An example: Alzzari Joseph, with just 21 first-class matches, has been pitted against Alastair Cook, England's highest ever Test run scorer and a man who may become the leading run scorer in Test history. Good luck with that, Alzzari.

Somehow, the most talented young West Indians have to play more tough first-class cricket before they get in the Test team. Only then can the batsmen learn more discipline and patience, knowing when to attack and when to defend. Only then can the bowlers develop more consistency of line and length. Only then will these players develop. At the moment, this is a team ill-equipped for Test cricket.

How they get more first-class exposure is the difficult question. The domestic competition in the Caribbean is lacking quality and depth and many of the region's better and more experienced players are plying their trade in T20 tournaments around the world. When Miguel Cummins goes back to play domestic cricket, he's not bowling to Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo or Keiron Pollard. He's bowling to lesser players and getting away with the type of loose balls that Cook and Joe Root gorged on in England's first innings.

Away from the Test team, West Indies 'A' have played just nine first-class matches since 2012, which has meant the likes of Joseph have been plucked straight from the Under-19 team in to Test cricket. It is not an impossible jump to make successfully but it happens rarely and a regular programme of 'A' team cricket would expose these cricketers to more intense first-class cricket. Cricket West Indies have recognized this and have scheduled three 'Tests' against Sri Lanka 'A' and three against England Lions in the next six months.

There is talent in this team. Kraigg Brathwaite, who already has a Test double hundred, has made a decent start to his career and coach Stuart Law, a good judge of a batsman, reckons Shai Hope has the talent to become one of the world's best. Jermaine Blackwood's fighting spirit, on show during his 79 not out today, has been evident many times before and Shannon Gabriel, when fit, is a real handful with the ball. Twenty-year-old Joseph has plenty of potential, too.

Cricket West Indies must do all it can to nurture this talent. Law's appointment is a good one for he will bring some hardnosed street smarts to this young team and he needs to address his players' technical flaws and make them more consistent. An increase in funding from the ICC should help the board do more with 'A' team cricket and the domestic structure and the in-fighting that has dogged West Indian cricket for a decade has to stop. The appointment of Johnny Grave as chief executive holds promise in that regard.

There will be short-term pain like here at Edgbaston while these players develop but Law will expect at least more application than his side showed in this match. Given some improvement, it is still unlikely that there are the raw materials in the Caribbean to develop a world beating side but they will hope to develop a more competitive team over the next 18 months or so. A good place to start would be at Headingley next week.

China moves its gears to Integrated Strategic Deterrence,"China getting frustrated at the Dokalm stand-off is moving its war propaganda machinery from “Three Warfares” to the next higher level in its “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” doctrine against India to achieve its objective of withdrawal of the Indian troops. It has opened other fronts at the border to project that it could raise the level of the present stand-off to a full-fledged war. Stone pelting incident at the Pangong Tso on the 15th August is a testimony of this stratagem.

In the above context, it is important to understand what the Chinese objective behind such acts is. Strategically speaking, China is in expansionist mode. Since 1949, China in accordance with its well-crafted strategy is expanding its territory. After consolidating itself through the demographic changes in Tibet and brutally crushing the Tibetan autonomy supporters resulting in the suicide of several monks, it has decided to annex more and more territory in the periphery.

Since the Xi’s coming into power, China has adopted an aggressive policy to acquire territories in its periphery in three areas- South China Sea, East China Sea and at the Sino-Indian border in accordance with its 18th Century expansionist mind-set. The Chinese strategy has several steps to achieve its objective of acquiring territories without firing a bullet in line with Sun Tzu’s advice that supreme art of war is to subdue enemy without fighting. Overall the strategy is “Integrated Strategic Deterrence”.

This has the aim of achieving strategic deterrence by non-fighting means or fighting a small war. Several military and non-military capabilities like nuclear, conventional, space and information warfare, economic, diplomatic, scientific and technological as also the collective will of the nation constitute the ‘Integrated Strategic Deterrence’. This demands the following three components-

1. Possession and projection of an adequate credible military force.

2. The will and determination to use that force.

3. Communication using different means to the adversary that such a force can be actually used.

For the above purpose, China has evolved the Three Warfares. This has three elements. The first is the psychological campaign aimed at building the psychological pressure to scare, demoralise and deter its adversaries. The second is media warfare aimed at projecting that it is an injured nation to build international opinion in its favour and to ‘expose’ the weaknesses of adversaries. This is also used for convincing its domestic audience of the righteousness of its stance. The main theme is project that it lost its territories to the forces of colonialism and imperialism and it must work to retrieve its lost territories and past greatness. This was projected as the ‘Chinese dream’ in 2014. The third is the fabricated legal arguments to justify its stand. The cartographic aggression forms an essential element of this process. The Three Warfares is based on use of its official media and exploitation of social media platforms. Its projections are based on disinformation and mendacity.

The aggressive behaviour is thus a function of its ‘rise’ and ‘dream’ aimed at changing the strategic environment in its favour in line with its expansionist policy. Since India has not been deterred by the use of means of Three Warfares, China has begun using other tactics to deter India. This suggests that China could launch an extensive cyber-attack and intrude at other points along the Sino-Indian border to deter India. To project its intentions of using force, the Chinese deployment of force may also be increased.

The problem is also partly domestic for China. Having raised the level of propaganda to this level Xi cannot withdraw without a loss of face. With Congress likely to meet in November, any withdrawal will project Xi in a weaker position. While second tern for him is not going to be a problem, the criticism against his policies is increasing. There are persons who think that Xi is incapable of handling the Chinese economic problems.

As far as India is concerned, it cannot accept unilateral changes at the border. The Chines arguments are hollow. China does not take into account the agreements reached in 1988 and 1998 with Bhutan and in 2012 with India. It also does not take into account that Bhutan was not a party to 1890 treaty. The Sikkim documents prove that the current position of tri-junction is in accordance with the treaty of 1890. China is also unhappy over India’s stand on the Belt Road Initiative and on the South China Sea. India has exposed the Chinese neo-colonial policy behind the Belt Road Initiative which has the objective of placing smaller nations into debt traps and controlling their policies to its advantage. India’s stand on the South China Sea is also being disliked by China. India has supported the implementation of the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s Ruling that has declared the Chinese claims of the region in the nine-dash lines as illegal, unacceptable and unjustified.

India’s calm reaction coupled with firmness at the Doklam is unnerving the Chinese authorities. As a reaction China has intensified its false propaganda. The more it indulges in falsehood the more it exposes its weaknesses in arguments. India without getting provoked has reflected that it is not going to be deterred by the escalation of level of deterrence by China.

The Chinese authorities should see that in the 21st Century it cannot deter nations like India. It should also realise that if India is further pushed, it can stop or reduce trade with China which will be disastrous for the latter. That would make Xi’s position very weak before the Congress meet of the Chinese Communist party. Xi should take advantage of India’s initiative to resolve the issue peacefully and through negotiations. Indian PM’s initiative to attend the BRICS meeting in the Chinese city of Xiamen ‘in the interest of all nations’ should be utilised by Xi to diffuse the tension at the border."
"200 Gujarat Families Transport Human Waste, 'Swachh Bharat' Built Toilets But No Sewerage Lines","Champa Vaghela, who discontinued studies after class 12, and a neighbour carry waste from her house in Vejalpur to be dumped in the open.

As Swachch Bharat campaign picks up momentum and the Gujarat government tom-toms the record number of toilets it has built across the state, around 200 families in Vejalpur and Thaltej are literally forced to carry their own excreta and dispose it off daily. The reason: the government has built toilets for them but not provided sewerage lines to dispose it off.

According to the Swachch Bharat Mission website, 87.41 per cent of households in the state have been provided with toilets till now.

TOI/Representational Image

As Amdavadis line up plans to celebrate the New Year, 150 families in Vejalpur and another 75 in Thaltej have more pertinent problems to deal with. The families, mostly from Dalit and Valmiki communities who earn less than Rs 10,000 per month, are forced to shell out Rs 2,000 on resurfacing the cesspits. To ease their burden, they dispose it of themselves before the cesspit gets filled up. This has been their daily routine for the past one year. Numerous representations and repeated pleas to the civic body have failed to improve their condition.

While Vejalpur councillor Panna Rao claims there is no such problem in her area, Thaltej councillor says gutter connection has been provided. What residents say At 18, Champa Vaghela was forced to stop studying after clearing class 12. Her daily ritual now is to empty an open sink behind the toilet, fill up the waste in a container and throw it out. She belongs to a family of six who reside in Vejalpur.

""We have had a toilet for a year, but all the waste gets collected outside which we empty every day. The smell is so strong that our heads start reeling, but we have no solution. Nobody other than us will clean it,"" said Champa.

Kiritbhai Kabira has been living in Thaltej for the past 20 years. It was only last year that his family of seven was provided with a toilet under the government's scheme. Only half the cost was shared by the government, but there is no sewerage connection.

""We have been told by civic officials who visit us often that our houses will be demolished for redevelopment and so the sewage line has not been provided. But we cannot control our bowel till we get a connection.""

TOI/Representational Image

Kabira further shared his agony, ""The cesspit adds 2,000 rupees to our expenses when we open it to remove the waste and get it resurfaced. Other additional problems include absence of streetlights and no pucca road. Development just seems a long way away.""

Dashrathbhai is worried about the diseases that his family of six and others will have to face due to the unhygienic conditions created by the open dumping of the waste. Champa Purabia who stays with her grandchildren has a lake full of waste behind her oneroom house. The 55-year-old woman is unaware as to who built the toilet at her place, ""It may be an organisation or government. I was happy that after residing here for more than a decade, I would be free from queueing up outside the Sulabh Sauchalaya. However, that is not to be. Only my two grandchildren use the toilet, otherwise the cesspit will be filled up and we will have to spend money to get it resurfaced. I still stand in the Sulabh line since 5 am to relieve myself and after dark it is open defecation.""

Purshottam Vaghela, director of Manav Garima, an NGO that works for the benefit of manhole workers said, ""Laws have been made and rules have been framed that makes such work illegal, but it continues unabated. The government's toilet scheme is just a show off as the toilets have been without the basic gutter connection.""

What officials say Vejalpur councillor Panna Rao claims she is a regular visitor to the area, but has not found such a problem in the area.

""Nobody has ever brought this to my notice. But now I will personally check the situation.""

Thaltej councillor Laxmi Chaudhary too is unaware of such a situation in her ward. ""Cesspit is a long lost system. I have visited families doorto- door, but have not noticed such a problem. And as per government scheme, along with the toilet, gutter connection is also provided. I am amazed to know this.""

AP

Lalsinh Thakore, BJP whip and Thaltej councillor said, ""There is a procedure to follow before providing any facility to slum dwellers. Paying tax to AMC is nothing new, we need to check if their stay is legal or illegal or they are just temporary dwellers.""

When Mirror questioned that if the dwellers were staying illegally, then why they were provided the toilets under the government scheme, to which Thakore said, ""There is no logic behind providing toilets and no sewerage connection. The metro work is in full swing and the area will be redeveloped, so if sewerage connection is provided and if we pull down their slums, then the game of allegation will start.""

In the past one and half years, AMC has built 22,000 individual toilets, 24 pay-and-use toilets and 41 public toilets in the entire city.

Deputy Municipal Commissioner C R Kharsan claims that 90 per cent of toilets have sewerage connection.

Kharsan said, ""Such problem prevails only in four or five areas which account for over 1,000 toilets in the city that don't have a sewerage connection. Each area has a septic tank which directly sucks the waste so the question of cesspit does not arise.""

He added, ""One reason why these slums have not been provided the sewerage connection is because of development. Under the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), the slums will be redeveloped and they will be given a flat instead, so keeping this in mind sewerage connection might not have been provided.""

"UP government slashes medical education budget by 50%, Health News, ET HealthWorld","LUCKNOW: As the death of 23 children in a single day in Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) grabs national headlines, a sharp cut by the Aditya Nath Yogi government in the budgetary allocation for medical education this year is raising questions. That's because this is the head under which the BRDMC, like other state-run colleges, receives funds.The budgetary allocation for 14 such medical colleges and their associated teaching hospitals has been pared to less than half from Rs 2,344 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 1,148 crore for 2017-18. The allocation for BRDMC followed the pattern, plunging from Rs 15.9 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 7.8 crore for 2017-18. More specifically, its allocation for machines/equipment was slashed from Rs 3 crore to just Rs 75 lakh.The budgetary allocation fell across all medical colleges. For example, the medical colleges in Kanpur and Allahabad saw their allocations come down from Rs 15.9 crore each to Rs 3.3 crore and Rs 4.2 crore, respectively."

"Tesla: Tesla’s India plans: Challenges and hurdles that they must face, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","We know for sure that the Model 3 will be Tesla’s first electric car for India. When the car actually makes its way to showrooms in India is still up in the air. Mid 2019 seems like a likely date – but why the delay?According to Tesla’s official statement, “Every country has its own set of rules and regulations, which means that we effectively must build a different car for different markets.”These 480 Volt DC charging stations are essential for Tesla’s to be able to complete cross country trips. It’s estimated that each Supercharger station can cost between US$ 150,000 to 200,000 to build. Those costs may possibly be lower in India.Components can only be waived if Tesla sets up manufacturing plant India. This will obviously take time and a great deal of investment. Discussions for duty waivers are on but it also seems like Tesla is keener to manufacture in Shanghai rather than India.It aims to electrify all passenger vehicles in India by 2032 seems out of sync with current import fee structure for completely built (CBU) electric cars. For cars that cost up to US$ 40,000, import duties are in the range of 60 per cent which makes them unviable.Even though the model 3 is Tesla’s most affordable electric car, it looks like prices in India could translate into roughly Rs 40 lakh for the entry-level (after taking into account current import duties).

4 Students From Bangalore Develop An App That Alerts You When You're Sleepy While Driving A Car,"Next time, when you yawn while steering your car, just slow down, stop and check where the nearest coffee shop is on your mobile phone with the help of this app.

Representational Image

According to a story done by BS, this app is made by four engineering students of Bengaluru's PES University.

Akshay Kumar, Saahil Kamath, Rahul B Prakash and Aviral Joshi who weren't college friends but met during an internship project at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore thought why can't technology be used to reduce accidents on the road. As a result, they made an app which alerts the driver if he or she yawns while driving.

The already patented image recognition and artificial intelligence based system will be available nearly 80 percent cheaper to the similar services available in high-end cars. The system for the individual car will be available between Rs 9000-12000."
"For Digital India to really reap benefits, some key technology-related issues need to be resolved","By Kala S Sridhar & V Sridhar

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has argued for making the country digital, and paved the way for electronic payments and receipts through applications such as the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and online wallets. GoI intends to offer higher cashbacks if digital modes of payment are adopted. This has the potential to make India a country with low degree of corruption and black money, given that all transactions will be accounted for.

But there’s a flip side. Psychologically, cash brings with it responsibility. By extension, cashless transactions imply irresponsibility. When we swipe a debit or credit card, it doesn’t really pinch. But when we pay for something in cash, it makes us think several times, since we need to go to the ATM or bank regularly to get cash. So, what are the disadvantages of ‘digital’ spending? At the macro level, saving takes a hit, and the economy may be deprived of much-needed investment and capital accumulation in infrastructure and in other sectors required to boost the rate of economic growth.

At the micro level, the spending spree enabled by cashless transactions will imply less liquidity, and less saving for future generations. According to the Institute of Management Development’s World Competitiveness Centre, tech-savvy countries most digitally ready are Singapore, Sweden, the US, Finland and Denmark. The scores are based on the country’s ability to adopt digital technologies, leading to changes in government practices, business approaches and society in general. India is ranked 51st here. While the average domestic savings rate in the most tech-savvy countries is at 29%, and only at 15% in the least techsavvy ones, the future trajectory of the ‘savings and digital’ relationship is clear.

India’s domestic savings rate for 2015, according to the World Bank, is 31%, much higher than that of tech-savvy and digital Finland (21%), and of the US (17%) in 2015.

Further, Brazil and South Africa with higher digitisation are at only 16% and 20% domestic savings rate respectively, lending credence to the inverse relationship between digital payments and savings.

Don’t Have Right Connection

Also, is India prepared for digital transactions? This is a country with low information and communication technology (ICT) penetration. ‘There is a problem with the system’, ‘servers are slow’ or ‘OTP is not sent’ are constant refrains.

Digital payments require the user to be internet- and mobile-savvy. One has to remember at least two factors of authentication before completing each transaction. The two-factor authentication, while improving security, is not very user-friendly and, in most cases, depends on the telecommunication infrastructure.

According to the World Economic Forum Global Information Technology Report 2016, India is ranked 114 (out of 139 countries) in network infrastructure sub-index. The recent State of the Internet Connectivity 2017 by Akamai Technologies indicates that India is ranked 89th in internet connection speed. The poor broadband infrastructure and associated quality of services affect the timely and successful completion of electronic transactions.

Further, the digitally illiterate depend on middlemen to perform their digital transactions. As old habits die hard, the middlemen, now armed with technological skills, extract rent from the user. These tech-savvy middlemen have access to the passwords and account details of their customers, and, hence, can do irreparable financial damages and invade consumer’s financial privacy.

The accountability and liability of the different service providers — such as the telecom operators, payment gateway providers and app providers — in case the digital transactions fail, are not specified in any regulation. In most cases, it is left to the poor user/consumer to fight it out. Most often, the blame game on each other leaves the customer empty handed and with his or her financial privacy at risk.

It may well be the case that cash or digital payments do not really determine the degree, and pace, of consumer spending. But this much is for sure: if we accept rational human behaviour, digital payments are needed in an era of slow growth, when effortless consumer spending is needed for pump-priming the economy.

On the other hand, when the economy is inflationary, it is preferable that cash transactions are made, enabling consumer restraint. The promise of cashback for a digital payment is counterproductive.

A Tech-tonic Shift

In the interests of freeing the country of corruption that it promises, digital payments should be encouraged, understanding their effects on consumer spending. After all, as a country’s income keeps increasing, it will become more, not less, technologically advanced.

Hence, to facilitate digital transactions, regulations should be formulated regarding the onus and liability of different players in the digital economy, such that consumer interests are protected.

"The king is dead, long live the king","Infosys is going through an internal convulsion, beating down its stock and contributing to the fall of the overall market index. When a palace coup happens, who falls and who rises is a matter of vital interest to a small number of people who form the dramatis personae. For the country as a whole, what matters, once shedding a ceremonial tear for the fallen and hailing the victor are done, is that whoever is the new ruler should keep the country stable and improve the quality of governance. The same principle applies to Infosys.

It is natural for Infosys insiders to work up a passion over the rights and wrongs of Narayana Murthy’s constant sniping at Vishal Sikka and Sikka’s failure to counter that guerrilla action, leading to his eventual ouster. For investors in the company and for the rest of the information technology sector, what matters is that the transformation in the business model initiated by Sikka, leading to steady rise in revenue per employee, should continue. The information technology sector is ripe for disruption. It must adapt to the new environment in which automation and artificial intelligence would take over a lot of the customary work done by legions of coders.

Instead of falling victim, India’s information technology needs to drive the change. Vishal Sikka and the current Infosys board that supported him recognised the challenge and set in motion a process of change. This is all to the good. But the process of change has been accompanied by a cultural clash, between austere conservatism and expensive flamboyance, which has led to much heartburn among the old guard.

Their backlash has been strong enough to oust the torchbearer of change. Whoever comes in next would have to be culturally more compatible but no less insistent on the need for change than Sikka has been.

Narayana Murthy’s return from corporate self-exile to activism raises serious questions. Should a founder retire at all, unless other shareholders find him a hindrance to growth? Having handed over the wheel to someone else, why do backseat driving? But the real challenge is to keep Infosys growing and evolving."

During his presence at the event, Dr Alvin C Powers shared with ETHealthworld insights on latest advances in drug and technologies in diabetes care. An edited excerpt:Insulin infusion devices or insulin pumps are now being coupled with devices that frequently measure the blood glucose level without a finger prick (or with a very few finger pricks).New types of diabetes drugs are mainly for use in type-2 diabetes. In addition to drugs like metformin and DPP-IV inhibitors that are widely used, there are now drugs that reduce the blood glucose in other ways such as promoting the excretion of glucose in the urine. There are also new types of insulin that act more rapidly or last longer than those currently in use.New findings help in understanding how the human pancreatic islet, which produces several hormones like insulin and glucagon, works and how it is destroyed in type-1 diabetes or becomes dysfunctional in type-2 diabetes. For example, we now know of many individuals with type-1 diabetes who continue to take small amount of insulin dosage for many years after the onset of diabetes.Continuous glucose monitoring allows the individual with diabetes to monitor his or her glucose level and then adjust the insulin dose. If not perfect, this gives a person with diabetes, especially type-1 diabetes, the ability to regulate the blood glucose and better avoid hypoglycaemia or low blood glucose."
"Centre pledges its full support for Startup Inc, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","BENGALURU: Key central ministers pledged the wholehearted support of the Narendra Modi administration for startups and announced measures to help entrepreneurs innovate in areas of national priority and overcome eligibility barriers in government contracts.Under the new General Financial Rules, the government will give priority to products from startups in official procurement, said Ravi Shankar Prasad , Union minister for electronics & information technology and law & justice, at the ET Startups Awards 2017 on Friday.The announcement addresses a long-standing demand of startup entrepreneurs, who feel stringent eligibility criteria prevent them from participating in government contracts. This will also help government get access to new innovations and ideas developed by startups to solve critical problems.“This is just the beginning of the hand holding of the government (for startups); money will not be a problem,” said Prasad, who also announced that the government will open 100,000 or more data sets of citizen-related information for startups to use for innovation on a licence but without a fee. The government will also give a Challenge Grant of Rs 5 crore each for companies innovating in the fields of health, agriculture and cybersecurity, Prasad announced. Piyush Goyal , Union minister of state for power , coal, renewable energy and mines, promised all out support for startups.“Whatever help we can do as government, we would be delighted to do. We would like to partner with your initiatives,” he said.“We would like to support your efforts, be a part of this new ecosystem, learn from you what can be done better; engage with you and your ideas to achieve the vision of a new India,” Goyal told a gathering of more than 400 entrepreneurs, investors and others at the glittering ceremony.“Government doesn’t have a monopoly on ideas... We believe that the more youngsters in this country are given an opportunity to engage with the government, we will be able to connect new ideas with the needs of the society,” Goyal said in course of a panel discussion. Goyal also highlighted the pivotal role of startup entrepreneurs in creating jobs as large entities alone cannot generate adequate employment in the age of robotisation and artificial intelligence.Prasad invited startups to adopt 18-20 villages each and provide innovative solutions in areas of virtual health solutions and education. “We are also launching 1,000 digital villages, which will provide solar power, virtual education, virtual health, etc.,” he said. Rajan Anandan, vice-president, South-East Asia and India, Google, participating in a second panel discussion at the Awards, said the present government is doing more for startups than any other government.

"Disrupted Gut Microbiome makes children more susceptible to amoebic dysentry, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Children with lower diversity of microbial species in their intestines are more susceptible to severe infection with the Entamoeba histolytica parasite , according to a new study published in PLOS Pathogens E. histolytica is an amoeba that typically spreads via food, water, or hands that have been contaminated with feces. Some infected people have no symptoms, but others experience symptoms of varying severity, from mild abdominal symptoms to life-threatening disease. The factors that influence severity are unclear, but previous studies suggest an important role for the gut microbiome In the new study, Koji Watanabe of the University of Virginia and colleagues collected and analyzed stool samples from children in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. They found that children who experienced colon inflammation because of E. histolytica infection had lower diversity of microbes in their stool than children with asymptomatic infection.To better understand these findings, the researchers used antibiotics to disrupt the gut microbiome in mice. They then exposed the mice to E. histolytica to see whether they were more susceptible to infection. The researchers found that mice treated with antibiotics had more severe colon inflammation than untreated mice.Mouse tissue and gene expression analysis showed that disruption of the gut microbiome decreased the activity of infection-fighting white blood cells known as neutrophils. The surface of neutrophils in these mice had lower amounts of a protein known as CXCR2 than in untreated mice. CXCR2 plays a role in the recruitment of neutrophils to fight infection in the gut, so decreased CXCR2 levels likely resulted in the observed decreased neutrophil activity.The analysis also showed that disruption of the mouse gut microbiome decreased production of a protein known as interleukin-25, which aids the function of the mucosal barrier that acts as the intestine’s first line of defense against infection.These findings suggest a molecular mechanism by which disruption of the gut microbiome increases severity of E. histolytica infection, but further research will be needed to determine if similar molecular effects occur in humans. Meanwhile, the finding that disruption of the mouse gut microbiome can interfere with neutrophil activity may be of broader interest in research of other infectious diseases."
"Knee implants: Claims of superiority by ‘new and improved’ brands of knee implants have little basis: NPPA, Health News, ET HealthWorld","(File Photo used for representation only.)

NEW DELHI: Claims of superiority by ‘new and improved’ brands of knee implants over existing ones have little basis, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority has concluded after examining studies published in international medical journals and consulting orthopaedic surgeons.Based on this, it feels that there is a “need to sensitize patients about limitations of these hyped technologies” and to moderate their prices – typically much higher than those for older, established implants. This emerges from the minutes of the NPPA ’s deliberations into price fixation for knee implants.It has decided to request the Indian Orthopaedic Association , Indian Medical Association and Association of Healthcare Providers (India) to sensitize orthopaedic surgeons not to push so called ‘new technologies’ with unproven claims of superiority over standard implants. The authority noted that even where patients could afford to pay the extra cost, they ought to be briefed about both the benefits and limitations of the ‘latest’ technology in comparison with the established one.One study of five widely used device technologies, including two ‘innovative’ knee implants - high flexion knee replacement and gender specific knee replacement -- concluded that none of the innovations improved functional or patient-reported outcomes.The study based on data collected from pre-market application and mandated post-market studies at the US Food and Drug Administration noted that existing devices may be safer to use in total hip or knee replacement. “Improved regulation and professional society oversight are necessary to prevent patients from being further exposed to these and future innovations introduced without proper evidence of improved clinical efficacy and safety,” stated the study published in the British Medical Journal in 2014.The NPPA examined the various types of implants based on their construction material, application and other technological aspects as the authority knew from its earlier experience with price capping for cardiac stents that hospitals, industry and surgeons would raise the issue of ‘new generation technology’ when it came to fixing a ceiling price.The NPPA noted that companies were promoting ‘high flexion knee’ implants in India claiming they have higher flexibility in day-to-day active life and sitting postures required for performing several religious and cultural practices. However, an analysis of trials suggested that “no clinically relevant or statistically significant improvement was obtained in flexion with the high flex prostheses”.“These high flexions are being sold in India at a premium in spite of the fact that its clinical long term superiority is not yet established even after a period of 20 years,” observed the NPPA.The NPPA also looked into the comparative merits of knee implants made from alloys of cobalt chromium, titanium and zirconium. The Authority found that the oldest, most widely used and clinically proven technology is implants made from alloy of cobalt-chromium (CoCr). CoCr’s limitation it that it releases tiny particles (metal ions) in the body which may cause allergic reactions in some individuals.However, titanium alloy which has superior biocompatibility and enhanced erosion resistance, was found to have poor shear strength and resistance to wear. And though oxidised zirconium was shown to have less wear and tear compared to CoCr, there were a larger proportion of revision surgeries to replace or compensate for failed implants with oxidised zirconium than with CoCr.The NPPA also noted that studies and senior surgeons had found that the claimed clinical edge of un-cemented implants was yet to be established."

"Dilip Shanghvi: Billionaire Dilip Shanghvi offers mea culpa after Sun Pharma loss, Health News, ET HealthWorld","The billionaire founder of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. pledged that the drugmaker would do better after reporting its first loss in at least 12 years amid regulatory headaches and a weakening market for generic drugs.“The reason why we are suffering is our inability to execute,” Dilip Shanghvi said on a conference call with analysts after the results were released. “The only solution is our focus on improving execution.“India’s biggest drugmaker posted a total loss of $66.3 million in the three months ended June 30, the Mumbai-based company said in a filing. That compares with a profit estimate of about Rs 1180 , on average, among 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The swing into the red came largely on the back of a Rs 951 crore US antitrust settlement. Generic drugmakers have seen their U.S. businesses deteriorate as regulators there step up product approvals, ushering in new competition and prompting a steady erosion in prices. Consolidation among the biggest pharmacies has also limited manufacturers’ pricing power.U.S. generic-drug giant Mylan NV lowered a long-targeted profit goal this week and Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world’s largest generic drug maker, said last week that it would pull back from 45 markets and cut jobs. Sun Pharma’s Israel-based unit Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. said it expects pricing pressure to continue.India’s pharma companies started reporting quarterly results two weeks ago, with many showing double-digit declines in revenue or profit. Over that span the stock index tracking the industry has plunged more than 11 percent. Sun Pharma’s stock has fallen more than 18 percent in that time to Rs 450 a share.Sun Pharma is particularly exposed to a squeeze on prices in the U.S., which accounts for about half its revenue, because its ability to offset falling prices with new products is hampered by a Food and Drug Administration sanction over manufacturing deficiencies at its factory at Halol in western India. Despite costly remediation efforts the company has been unable to shake off the sanction since 2015.Shanghvi said on Friday that Sun has completed additional remediation demanded by the FDA after its latest inspection last year and asked the regulator to inspect the plan again.Shanghvi reiterated guidance that Sun’s consolidated revenue would likely decline this fiscal year, though margins on its earnings before taxes and various items would likely improve to 22 percent in the second half from a low of 17 percent in the first quarter.Sun was tipped into a loss this quarter after it agreed in July to pay plaintiffs including Canadian rival Apotex Inc. to settle a U.S. antitrust lawsuit over sleep-disorder drug modafinil, according to the filing. Excluding the settlement, Sun’s profit was still down 74 percent from the same period last year to Rs 530 crore amid slower sales in both India and the U.S.Sun’s U.S. sales were down 42 percent from the previous year to $351 million, though the earlier period included exclusive rights to sell generic versions of Novartis AG’s blockbuster cancer drug Gleevec that expired in July of last year, the company said in its press release.“Going forward they will face problems because in the U.S. market there will not be clarity for at least another two quarters” as pricing pressures will remain, Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst at Centrum Broking Pvt., said before the results announcement. “The U.S. FDA is giving approvals much faster so smaller companies are coming into the fray and competing with larger companies.”As prices for simple generic drugs fall in the U.S. Sun Pharma has been investing in the development of more complex therapies as well as completely new ones to fend off competition.The company’s leading candidate is a novel treatment for the skin condition psoriasis, which it has said should be ready in the year ending March 31, 2019. The treatment could provide a valuable new revenue stream for Sun Pharma, according to Kapadia."

"11th edition of FICCI gets under way, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI, August 17, 2017. C K Mishra , Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, today underlined the need for investing two-thirds of the spending in primary healthcare and enhancing preventive care to keep the requirement of diagnostic care and admission to hospitals in check. As financial resources are limited, it is essential to invest in the right place for optimal results, he said while inaugurating the 11th edition of FICCI HEAL on the theme ‘ Indian Healthcare : A Patient’s View’.Mr. Mishra said that infrastructure in remote areas was weak and only government establishments were functional in such places; therefore active private sector participation was needed to make quality and affordable healthcare accessible to all.He said that the new National Health Policy 2017 with the three pillars of accessibility, affordability and quality of care are in line with a patient’s needs. He added that there was a need to customize care and value the choices of a patient.Recognising FICCI’s efforts in the health care space, Mr. Mishra said that the industry had been forthcoming with policy and reform suggestions, which enabled the government to strengthen its policies. He urged FICCI to develop a framework in conjunction with the government to step the country’s healthcare delivery system.On the occasion, Mr. Mishra released a Knowledge Paper ‘The healthcare consumer: Understanding expectations & experiences in the patients journey’ prepared by FICCI in collaboration with KANTAR-IMRB . The report is based on interviews with over 5000 patients pan-India from both public and private hospitals. Some key findings show that 61% of the patients rated their overall experience in private hospitals positively as compared to 45% for government hospitals. The report delves on the experiences and expectations of the patient and provides recommendations for the government and healthcare providers.Mr. Pankaj Patel, President, FICCI, said that the government’s intent to increase the public health spend to 2.5%, efforts should be made to increase it to 4% of GDP to meet the universal healthcare goals of the country. He added that long-term financing options from banks are still not available to healthcare providers and this was hampering the penetration of private healthcare in the country. He said that while retention of healthcare services in the tax exemption list under the GST regime is thoughtful and will enable flow of seamless tax credit and improve overall tax compliance, the services rendered by the hospital are exempted from taxes, several input services are subject to GST, which will result in increase in overall cost of care for the patient. Mr. Patel said that FICCI assures the government, its complete support for achieving affordable, accessible and quality healthcare to all Indians."
Nepal PM’s Visit: Kathmandu can be an interlocutor between New Delhi and Beijing,"Nepal’s Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba is embarking on a visit to India from August 23. The visit comes against the backdrop of the ongoing standoff between India and China over Doklam. And as a country surrounded by the two Asian giants, Nepal is bound to be affected by the ebb and flow of the India-China relationship. This is even more of a fact today as Nepal is seeking to come out of its geopolitical shell. Therefore, how the Doklam standoff pans out is as important for Kathmandu as it is for New Delhi and Beijing.

Needless to say, conflict between India and China would be disastrous for the trans-Himalayan region. Nepal, which is still recovering from the 2015 Giant Earthquake and is yet to fully operationalise its new Constitution, would not want India-China tensions over Doklam to escalate. It is absolutely imperative for Nepal to have peace in its neighbourhood so that it can conclude provincial and national elections by January 2018. Failure to do so would create yet another constitutional crisis in the Himalayan nation and delay development projects further.

In this respect, it’s understandable that Nepal needs both India and China for its development and prosperity. Nepal has already signed on to China’s flagship ‘One Belt One Road’ project of transnational connectivity. This is bound to give infrastructure building in Nepal a substantial boost. However, Nepal’s historic, geographic, political, ethnic, religious and cultural connections with India are far deeper. Kathmandu’s links with New Delhi go way beyond money and investments. Therefore, for durable peace and development in Nepal, Kathmandu simply can’t ignore its ties with New Delhi.

Given this scenario, Nepal is uniquely placed to mediate between India and China. Of course, such mediation must be done quietly and behind closed doors. Nevertheless, Kathmandu can be trusted with this task as it is in its own interest to bring New Delhi and Beijing on the same page. All three countries are immediate neighbours. And when two neighbours have a dispute, it is the responsibility of other neighbours to encourage and facilitate resolution.

Allowing Kathmandu to serve as an interlocutor also makes sense for India-Nepal relations. For far too long there has been an impression that New Delhi interferes in Nepal’s internal matters. Such an impression isn’t good for the future of India-Nepal ties. As highlighted by the five-month-long Madhesi blockade in 2015-16, suspicion of Indian interference can dent New Delhi’s credibility in Nepal overnight. Hence, the last thing that India should do is give the impression it is holding Nepal on a tight leash. In this context, having Nepal mediate between India and China will enhance Kathmandu’s independent geopolitical profile.

Besides, India has nothing to fear from this. As I mentioned before, India has deep ties with Nepal that no country can replace. Thus, New Delhi should see PM Deuba’s India visit as an opportunity to assert the concept of equal partnership between the two countries. Such an approach will take India-Nepal relations to heights rivalling the Himalayas."

"By creative policy, not rigid rules","Is the central government wrong to mandate private participation in any metro rail project it part-finances? Metro-man E Sreedharan thinks so, emphatically. He can list a number of instances of failed private participation in India and abroad. Rigid rules on the nature of ownership of infrastructure projects do not make sense, whether for or against private participation. The Centre can limit its participation in a project put up for co-financing to a level it thinks fair, given the size of the population of the city the metro seeks to serve. Beyond that, how the concerned state or local government seeks to finance it is not the Centre’s business. Malayalis who work in West Asia have funded airports in Kerala on considerations other than financial returns. That said, it does not make sense to bar private investment in any kind of infrastructure.

The bulk of the trillions of dollars of global savings seeking profitable deployment anywhere secure comprises non-state funds. It makes eminent sense to draw them into creating much-needed new infrastructure in the developing world, whose economic returns would be significant. If commercial returns do not capture the full extent of economic returns in a particular project, deterring private investment, the government can remedy that in many ways.

An outright subsidy is one option. More desirable would be measures such as levying a carbon tax on petro-fuels and congestion charges on road use that would make the fares needed to make a metro commercially attractive seem perfectly acceptable in comparison with travel by road. Would this not be a big burden on the common man?

Cheap transport for the urban commuter ultimately subsidises the business that employs that commuter. If this subsidy is removed, the costs and revenues of the business would reconfigure, that is all. Clean transport would improve health and lower healthcare costs as well.

Simply mandating a private role in infrastructure would not work. Supplementary action is required to make it attractive for the private sector to invest in infrastructure. That calls for policy innovation, not diktat."
"P.D. Hinduja Hospital: Screening is not a viable tool for detecting cancer in India: Dr. Sachin Almel, Health News, ET HealthWorld","In an interview with ETHealthworld,, Consultant Medical Oncologist,, talks about the cancer scenario in India. Edited excerpts:Cancer is definitely becoming one of the major killers as far as the incidence and other things are concerned. But in India, it still remains second or third on the list as we have other diseases which are probably the major killers. Compared to the Western world, I think cancer still has not caught up as yet, though the incidence in our country is increasing.If you’re asking me about whether we have adequate facilities for the treatment, the answer is no, because majority of these so called good treatment facilities or treatment centers are restricted to only the urban cities or urban areas of our country. And you have to understand that majority of our population resides in small towns and villages where they probably are not able to avail these facilities. So as of today, I feel we still don’t have enough facilities to cater to this burden of cancer which is ever increasing.As far as India is concerned, compared to the Western population, yes, the cancer incidence is definitely increasing. It is not the same as it’s seen in the Western population, but we are catching up definitely. There is an important difference in the kind of cancers which are increasing in our country viz-a-viz the Western population. For example- in Western countries, breast cancer in women is supposedly the leading cancer. But if you consider our country, we still know that cancer of cervix is the leading cancer in women. If you take into account the urban cities, urban areas, there the breast cancer has over-taken cervix as the major cancer in women. Likewise, the highest number of men suffering from prostate cancer and the incidence is increasing in our country. The difference is that cancer of the prostate is not the leading cancer in our country. In our country, we still have cancers of the tongue, head and neck region which remain one of the major cancers in men.If you look at the urban centers, yes we have adequate facilities. All the people living in the cities are able to avail these facilities. I must also admit that the facilities which are offered in many of these centers are at par with what you get in any of the top hospitals in the Western world. But, the problem lies in the fact that majority of the population of India are based out of towns and villages and there, the facilities are definitely very inadequate. There are not many centers which cater to that group of patients, and therefore, if you look at it as a whole, the facilities in our country are not adequate as yet, but things are improving. Lot of these major NGO’s and major organizations like Tata Memorial Hospital, Gujarat Cancer Research Institutes have their outreach centers at various places which cater to these kind of populations which don’t have an easy access to medical facilities. The awareness regarding this disease has also increased. So that also adds to the fact that the incidence of cancer is increasing and more importantly diagnosing a cancer does not end the matter for us, we need to treat it and that’s where the challenge lies. We don’t have enough facilities to treat those cancers as yet.Screening has been a debatable issue all over the world. Few years back it was said that screening is mandatory. Then came a time when people started talking about whether it is really helping in bringing down the incidence, the cost-benefit ratio was talked about, the amount of money that you spend to screen a large population of patients and at the end of it you are diagnosing say only a minuscule number of cancers. Then it is not a viable option for many of the countries. If you apply that to our country I feel screening is not a good tool for our country, because the population that needs to be screened is huge, so there would be a lot of wastage of revenue and at the end of it, the number of cancers that may be diagnosed or may be caught, is not going to be enough to actually make a difference. Plus the other important thing is the screening strategies which have been the guidelines for screening all over the world. Screening has made a difference in diagnosing cases of breast cancer, like mamograph for breast cancer and pap smear for cervical cancer in women, and PSA with digital rectal examination and to some extend fecal occult blood. These are some of the tests which have been advocated or they have said that these are the ones which should be done if someone wants to adopt a screening programme. Whereas for various other cancers, there are not proper screening programmes available, and therefore also it is a big debate whether we as a country, a third world country, whether we should even think about this. More importantly, we would rather want to propagate the message that prevention of cancer would probably be a better idea, other than just screening the cancer. We need to increase the number of treatment centers and improve the facilities which could be made available to the common man.Hinduja was one of the pioneers which came up with a proper day care center for medical oncology and oncology as a sub-specialty many years back. In those days probably, cancer was considered to be a disease in which there were no patients who would survive and all patients used to succumb to the disease sooner or later. But things have changed over the last few years. Hinduja day care center was one of the first ones, dedicated only for those patients who were receiving chemotherapy in a very conducive kind of atmosphere. Hinduja took an initiative, we had a programme in which many of our nurses were sent abroad to get trained in a proper oncology day care center, medical oncology day care center abroad. We had a tie up with Mass General Hospital Massachusetts, General Hospital and Boston. Our hospital looks into developing this support group for the cancer patients. We have a good up and running support group and in fact, just recently we had a lymphedema care which was conducted by the support group and the occupational therapist attached to our hospital. Another initiative, which is an initiative all over the country is the Pinkathon, but in Bombay the Pinkathon which is done, Hinduja Hospital plays a major role in it and we encourage all our patients, the survivors, those who are undergoing treatment and everyone to be a part of the Pinkathon, and we were represented by lot many patients from our hospital. So that is another initiative which we are very proud of."

Hope to learn from the India series: Steven Smith

• Last updated on Sat, 19 Aug, 2017, 06:56 PM Atif Azam in Dhaka

Australian skipper Steven Smith believes that spin and reverse swing will be key ingredients of the upcoming two-match Test series against Bangladesh.

""Spin will play a big part throughout this series. Reverse swing will be expected because the wicket will be abrasive,"" Smith said on Saturday (August 19).

Smith said that he expects a tough challenge from the hosts, who have recently been on the rise in Test cricket. Bangladesh drew with England in their last home series, winning one of the Tests, and also beat Sri Lanka at home to mark their 100th Test match.

""It will be a challenging series,"" said Smith. ""Bangladesh have played some brilliant cricket here. They beat England in a Test match here not too long ago. I think they have played some very good cricket here of late.

""Conditions are always foreign to us when we are in the subcontinent. The wickets are always not what we get at home.""

Smith said that he is expecting his boys to deliver, taking a cue from what they learned from the last Test series against India, as the weather and the conditions are going to be quite similar.

""I hope we can learn from the last Test series in India. I expect we will come across some pretty similar wickets, similar amount of spin. Hopefully we can learn from what we did there.""

Smith played safe when questioned about the favorites tag Australia seem to carry into the series. ""I am not picking a favourite,"" he said.

""We have to be confident in our skill set and hopefully we can get our processes right and have a really good series.""

The right-handed batsman added that he is on a mission to change the fortune of the Aussies in the subcontinent. ""Australia have won only two Test matches in the last 10 years in the subcontinent, courtesy their victories over India and Sri Lanka. Now it is an opportunity for us to change that. I thought we did some things really well in India.

""We just needed to do it for little bit longer, and consistently. This is another opportunity to showcase our skills, show what we learned over there and hopefully give our best foot forward.""

Australian team arrived at Dhaka on Friday (August 18) and will play two Test matches that are scheduled to be hosted in Dhaka and Chittagong.

Weather is set to be a concern for cricket though the last two days have been sunny. Smith seemed well aware of the weather that awaits him and his team.

""Hopefully the weather holds off and we can get some good cricket in the series,"" Smith said. ""There is some rain around. We don't know how much time curators gonna get to give to the wicket. We will have to adapt to whatever wicket we come up against on the first morning of the Test match.""

"India's coal imports declined 6.3 per cent to 192 million tonne last financial year, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: Import of coal saw a decline of 6.37 per cent to 191.95 million tonnes (MT) in 2016-17 on higher production by CIL that saw the country move to a regime of surplus coal.

Comparatively, in 2015-16 fiscal, coal imports stood at 203.95 MT, as per official data by the government.

""On enhanced production by Coal India (CIL), the country has moved from a regime of coal scarcity to a coal surplus situation,"" the document said.

As against the demand of 884.87 MT of coal, the total domestic production stood at 659.27 MT, it said.

The Centre has announced plans to boost CIL's annual production to the level of 1 billion tonnes by 2019 to meet the growing fuel demand.

Under the provisions of the Coal Mines (Special Provisional) Act, 2015, 30 mines have been allocated to private sector companies by way of auction for specified end uses till date.

The ongoing fiscal also shows a declining trend, especially of thermal coal.

Thermal and steam coal imports have fallen 17.37 per cent at the top 12 major ports to 29.82 MT during April-July this fiscal, according to the Indian Ports Association (IPA).

The ports, under the control of the Centre, had handled 36.09 MT of thermal and steam coal during the same period of the previous fiscal.

Thermal coal is the mainstay of India's energy programme as 70 per cent of power generation is dependent on the dry fuel.

Handling of coking coal, used mainly in steel-making, has also dipped 4.45 per cent to 16.51 MT, as per the latest data released by the IPA.

These ports had handled 17.27 MT of coking coal in April-July period of 2016-17.

Together, they handled 46.33 MT coal during April-July this fiscal as against 53.36 MT in the same period of the previous year.

India is the third-largest producer of coal after China and the US and has 299 billion tonnes of resources and 123 billion tonnes of proven reserves, which may last for over 100 years.

The country has 12 major ports - Kandla, Mumbai, JNPT, Marmugao, New Mangalore, Cochin, Chennai, Ennore, V.O. Chidambarnar, Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Kolkata (including Haldia) which handle approximately 65 per cent of the country's total cargo traffic."

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‘nationalist’ mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India’s ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism’s about freedom for the mind and democracy’s about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It’s time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar’s vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP’s madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don’t these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‘golf-playing Macaulayputra’, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities – of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation – feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn’t call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that’s why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler’s supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent’s ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That’s because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other’s shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It’s really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That’s why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament – the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet – the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism’s unobtrusive ‘soft power’, one that’s created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It’s time to change the goal of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to the more inclusive ‘Indian Rashtra.’ The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."

"Sharad Yadav eyes Mandal 2.0, but can he overcome Modi-Shah hurdle?","Sharad Yadav’s convention last week, ‘Sanjhi Virasat’, to preserve the ‘composite culture of India’, was better attended than expected. Interestingly, many opposition leaders who attended the meeting referred to Yadav as the new ‘sutradhar’ (the one who holds the threads) of opposition unity.

Looking at his long-standing experience in public life, understanding of caste politics and of Machiavellian back-room manoeuvres, he is probably best-suited to play that role.

It was Yadav who had nudged V P Singh in 1990 to suggest the implementation of the Mandal Commission’s report, giving 27% reservation to OBCs in government jobs, thereby bringing about a paradigm shift in north Indian politics.

Today, the Opposition is looking at Yadav once again to catalyse a new front to take on Narendra Modi in 2019. It is going to be a long haul.

The BJP has already rubbished Yadav’s convention as an effort by scared men. While there were 16 parties present, none came from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). Lalu Yadav, who has otherwise championed Opposition unity, sent a spokesperson. Surprisingly, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was not invited. But the meeting saw new terminologies come to the fore.

For starters, speakers at the convention avoided words such as ‘secularism’ that created a backlash in the past from among a section of Hindus, which had otherwise brought Opposition parties together before.

Second, speakers made a distinction between ‘Hindutva’ and ‘Manuvad’. Grandson of B R Ambedkar and Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh leader Prakash Ambedkar emphasised that their battle was against the imposition of ‘Manuvad’, which the BJP wants to impose, ultimately giving primacy to the upper castes.

Third, and taking this theme forward, Yadav said it was not a question about ‘minorities, but about the majority’, which was made up of Dalits, tribals, the backward classes, all the ‘vanchit’ (deprived classes) “who add up to 80% of the country’s population”. It was about their share in the power set-up. Interestingly, the only picture at the entrance of the convention and inside the hall was that of B R Ambedkar.

Yadav especially lauded Chhotubhai Vasava, the six times JD(U) tribal MLA from Gujarat, who despite allurements, voted for Ahmed Patel in the recent Rajya Sabha elections, his vote ensuring the Congress leader’s victory.

Yadav also applauded the ‘moral fibre’ of the tribals who were taking care of “our jal, jungal, zameen”. Vasava has recently launched his own party with aview to fighting the Gujarat elections in December.

There was also a subtle change in the language used by opposition leaders at the meeting. Ali Anwar, JD(U) Rajya Sabha MP, who has been suspended by Nitish Kumar and was anchoring the meeting, repeatedly referred to CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury as ‘Sita and Ram rolled into one’, and Bihar leader Ramai Ram as a fusion of ‘two Rams’.

Sharad Yadav’s eyes are now set on moving towards Mandal 2.0 to bring together tribals, Dalits, OBCs and minorities, even though he did not mention anything about Muslims. But this is not going to be easy going.

The BJP under Modi and Amit Shah has assiduouslywooed — and won over — large sections of Dalits, tribals, OBCs, extremely backward castes and a section of the poor. The attempt has been to marry caste identity with Hindutva.

The ‘Kamandal versus Mandal’ conundrum of the 1990s, which spawned backward-class leaders like Lalu Yadav, Nitish Kumar and Mulayam Singh Yadav — and also led to the rise of the BJP — is now giving way to a ‘Mandal plus Kamandal’ politics pursued by the ‘new BJP’ under Modi-Shah.

Even as many a leader, including the Congress’ Rahul Gandhi, spoke of the need to forge an opposition unity, the real challenge for Sharad Yadav will not just be to get the opposition parties on a common platform but to create one-on-one contests between the NDA and the Opposition in constituency after constituency in states where the Opposition parties have a presence.

The wheel has come full circle for Sharad Yadav personally. He started off as being the United Janata candidate from Jabalpur in 1974, the first test of Opposition unity, which prefaced the popular movements in Bihar and Gujarat, leading to an upsurge led by Jayaprakash Narayan, which had dethroned Indira Gandhi in 1977.

Will he choose to be 2017’s Harkishen Singh Surjeet, the late CPI(M) leader who brought the opposition together time and again? Like Surjeet, it is Yadav’s strength that he has the potential of being the sutradhar without becoming the Opposition’s face, leaving it to popular sentiment — or events — to determine the choice of the leader."
"Nice Move: BSF Adopts 'Wellness Quotient Assessment Test' To Curb Suicide, Depression In Jawans","The incident of a jawan posting a video of lack of amenities and bad quality of food given to them had gone viral, showing the miserable way of life they live in despite protecting the borders of the nation.

In order to address this issue, BSF Director General K K Sharma, in an interview to PTI, said he has initiated the projects with a concern to reduce such instances in the force on a priority basis.

In order to keep both - the jawans’ mental and physical health in check, a ‘wellness quotient assessment’ test will be added in their annual medical check up. ""We are doing some new things now, so that there is an early identification of such personnel (who are in stress or in trouble) and such instances are reduced to the best extent possible,"" the BSF DG said.

The jawans, are deployed for long spans of time at inhospitable climate along the Indo-Pak and Indo-Bangla borders, where they are unable to meet or communicate with their families.

What we have launched recently is a 'wellness quotient assessment test', the DG said, adding it is a multi-point questionnaire which is being ""linked"" to the annual medical test of jawans and officers. Sharma, a 1982-batch IPS officer, said under this pilot project, troops will have to reply to a variety of questions relating to a various life situations, challenges and conditions and these questions have been prepared by expert mental counsellors and doctors.

The test is aimed to identify those troops who need help psychologically by counseling. The records have stated that while in 2014 there were 46 suicides in the BSF, these numbers reduced to 27 in 2015 and 24 in the last year.

Another pilot project launched in the BSF in this context is called the 'mentor-mentee' system.

""There are people who are natural counselors. We are identifying such troops in the force. Such personnel can be further groomed to act as counselors and experts who would identify a buddy in trouble, help him or her and seek help of superiors to bring comfort to them,"" he said.



In 90 per cent cases, the BSF boss said, the trooper came back from leave and in the next 10-15 days they took the drastic step. It has been found that the tension and stress which the victim had, was of domestic nature.

Home-grown Nationalism,"

Rabindra Sangeet exponent REBA SOM focuses on Sister Nivedita, her nationalism and patriotism in the wake of her 150th birth anniversary. “She was an audacious woman who could hold her own,” she tells SONAL SRIVASTAVA





Margaret Elizabeth Noble aka Sister Nivedita set sail for India in 1898. Inspired by Swami Vivekananda — who initiated her in brahmacharini vows — Margot, as she was known to family and friends,made India her home. After her initiation,Swami Vivekananda called her ‘Nivedita,’ one who has dedicated her life to God.“She was a remarkable person.I don’t think we have focused enough on her,”says Reba Som, historian and Rabindra Sangeet exponent, who has written a book titled Margot: Sister Nivedita Of Vivekananda. Her book explores the life and beliefs of Sister Nivedita,including her views on nationalism and patriotism. Som frames Sister Nivedita’s life in the context of the pristine master-disciple relationship that Nivedita shared with her master, Swami Vivekananda. Often through her writings,she would present her master’s views.Encouraged by him,she gave a lecture on Kali worship at Calcutta’s Albert Hall, at a time when idol worship was looked down upon by Calcutta’s elite.However,Margot was also a rebel but one who could hold her own among illustrious personalities of Calcutta such as Abanindranath Tagore,Jagadish Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore and even her own master, Swami Vivekananda.



Som says that it is important to focus on the brave, sincere, and committed woman,who was audacious enough to have left her home in England at a young age and come to India,especially, since 2017 happens to be Nivedita’s 150th birth anniversary. Nivedita did not come to India with the withdrawn air of a curious foreigner;she came committed to adopting and judging India from her own inherited civilisational values, and not from western norms.” Nivedita had compassion,tolerance and a sense of inclusiveness.This sense of inclusiveness was strengthened by her acceptance of the Vedantic paradigm of Universal Oneness. Nivedita embodies assimilation and all-inclusiveness in many ways.“Swami Vivekananda had said that it’s not a question of tolerating other religions.The word toleration implies condescension. It’s a question of accepting them as Truth. You accept all religions as Truth,but you follow your own religion,” says Som, underlining it as a marvellous thought and stressing the need to accept other religions as Truth as one would perhaps accept his own. “Nivedita talks a lot about Islam and Buddhism. Buddhism for both Swamiji and Nivedita was full of high ideals. Nivedita never lost her Christian faith; she may have been a Hindu in the larger sense,yet she celebrated Christmas.There was something catholic, in the sense of a wide-embracing concept that was there in her and her master,” elaborates Som pointing to the magnanimous nature of Swami Vivekananda and his disciples. Nivedita had very strong political views that were unsettling for some.



She would voice her opinion with aplomb thanks to her upbringing by her grandfather who was an active participant in the Irish Freedom movement.“ She was a devoted disciple of Vivekananda; she also could not but be aware of the rumblings in the political life of the country at that time. Vivekananda did not want to be drawn into politics. He had his mission — Ramakrishna Mission.He was on a man-making mission. Nivedita wanted to go a step further.When Vivekananda died, she was not totally lost. On the other hand, she was able to reinvent herself with a new purpose.And that purpose was nationalism. She had her own definition of nationalism. She did not see the nation as a western construct or as a homogeneous identity that people like Rabindranath Tagore had problems accepting.” “Her nationalism was home grown, drawing from the civilisational unity of the country, from the epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,both great cohesive factors in India’s identity,” explains Som,juxtaposing Nivedita’s sense of nationalism to the current nationalistic fervour. “Patriotism at that time had a different context; it was national struggle for freedom. But her concept of nationalism goes beyond;it’s about instilling pride in yourself, but not in a narrow- minded,sectarian way.Even Swami Vivekananda was a Vedantist, but if he felt the need to worship Kali, he did it.Vivekananda explained that it’s not a question of either/or; it can be both. Again,we come to this inclusiveness.” In The Web Of Indian Life,Nivedita forms — from her extensive travels across the country — her sympathy for the nationalist endeavours of young people. She was Irish; she became anti-British when she saw the racial prejudices of the government.



Som quotes Nivedita in her book:“India must be observed by this great conception.Hindu and Mohammedan must become one in it with passionate admiration of each other. It means new views of history, of custom, and it means assimilation of the whole Ramakrishna- Vivekananda ideal in Religion — the synthesis of all religious ideas. It means a final understanding of the fact that the political process and the economic disaster are only side-issues, that the one essential fact is realisation of her own Nationality by the Nation.” Nivedita followed tradition, but at the same time also pursued religious reform. In the school that she started for girls, she not only wanted to teach young girls, but also young widows.Som says that tradition is not always moribund, outdated, archaic and no longer valid. Vivekananda had also lashed out against ritual worship prevalent at that time.“Tradition as underlined in our concepts is something to treasure, but we have to move on.The entire cultural heritage belongs to us.For Nivedita, her heroes were Akbar as well as Ashoka, she also talked about Prithviraj. That is our strength. And because she comes from the west, she is able to relate and correlate. She would keep comparing civilisations.So it’s not about this and not that. It’s about inclusive Vedantic theory,” says Som. At the end of the book, Som translates from Rabindranath Tagore’s Bangla obituary that he wrote when Nivedita died.“One had to respect her not because she was a Hindu,but because she was an outstanding human being.One had to salute her not for being like the rest of us, but for being better than us. She could claim pride from all not because of her Hindutva but because of her humanism.”

"‘Look, I’m so secular!’ The rise of virtue signallers on social media","The rise of social media in the past few years has meant that a lot of public opinion is debated, discussed and shaped on forums like Twitter and Facebook, and even thousands of local WhatsApp groups. One would imagine these powerful tools that connect millions can enable us to distill the best opinions on an issue, which can then shape our response to them.

However, there is a huge problem. These discussion forums are public. And in public, a lot of people are fake. They want to be seen as good, proper, balanced, modern and progressive. Most of all, they want to be seen as virtuous. If I can come across as a person who has these wonderful qualities to my 200-odd Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp friends, it is more valuable than actually saying what I feel on the issue.

In this context, a term called ‘virtue signalling’ has become popular on the internet recently, although it was used in a few articles several years ago. But it is only now that you see virtue signalling on full display.

Try this. Mention that “I don’t feel safe sending my parents on Amarnath Yatra after Muslim terrorists killed Hindu pilgrims.” Chances are several people out there will scream ‘communal! communal!’ to your statement before you even understand what on earth happened.

You see, these people have to show that they are so virtuous, so noble, and so good that they sense something is communal even when others don’t. Of course, there is nothing wrong in your original statement, as you are stating a fear based on an incident that has occurred.

However, the virtuous lot on the internet will demand that a) you don’t mention any religion at all ever, b) as Hindus are in majority, we must never raise an issue that affects Hindus because that makes us majoritarians and c) a truly virtuous person will not see this as an act against Hindus, but merely some bad people trying to hurt some good people and that is all that needs to be mentioned.

Of course, that is not how the human mind works or thinks. The fact remains that many Hindus will now think twice about sending their elderly parents to pilgrimage sites, particularly in Kashmir. However unsavoury, this needs to be discussed. How can we have a country where the majority of people feel unsafe about going to their places of worship? Is it communal to discuss this issue and come up with solutions?

According to the virtue signallers, it is. Your mentioning the word Hindu, let alone an issue that affects only Hindus, will brand you as communal. This is because by doing so, they come across as virtuous. When they attack you in anger, they are saying, ‘Look, I am such a secular person that the mere mention of the word Hindu makes me mad. Look, I am so good and secular that any hint of a Hindu issue makes me seethe with anger. And now that I have shown I am more virtuous, I have the right to attack the others. My goodness gives me sanction to abuse, insult and be rude to anyone else who isn’t that virtuous.’

We sometimes mistakenly refer to these people in India as fake-liberals, pseudo-seculars or elitists. All they are doing is virtue signalling, showing how modern and progressive they are — so they look good to their virtual peers.

Hence, take a statement like, “Although we must have laws to protect women, some men are suffering due to fake domestic violence or fake harassment cases because some people are abusing the laws (something any lawyer or policeman dealing in such cases will attest).” Virtue signallers will jump on this and feast all day, calling it ‘sexist, anti-women, backward or whatever else’ because when you say that, you show that you are so equality-conscious.

Virtue signallers operate in many other arenas. They show their support for women’s cricket in their social feeds (though chances are they have never watched a women’s cricket match on TV in their lives).

Virtue signallers want to promote independent cinema over commercial cinema (though they don’t go and watch independent cinema in theatres). Virtue signallers want to show that they care about Dalits and Muslims, not because they actually care about Dalits and Muslims or do anything about it, but because stating so makes you look good on social media.

Beware of such utterly fake people, and avoid engaging in debate with them. They will tire and bore you to death with statements that don’t answer the issue at hand, but merely make them look good.

Virtue signalling is a reality of today’s social media. Because whenever we feel judged by a lot of people, we hide our true self and try to look good. It’s noise on the internet and, like trolls, must be ignored. We must debate issues by saying things as they are, for only then can a solution be found."

Healthy Food Or Naughty Snack? Fitness Blogger Debunks Claims About Some Of Our Favourite Grub,"Lucy Mountain would have been just another fitness blogger, but she isn't that ordinary. Her stories and blogs are serving as the gospel truth to everyone who is obsessed with the food they eat.

With the recent health awakening of the world, it almost seems like everyone wants to know what they are eating, the calorie intake, the protein intake and other rudiments associated with it. In this rush, people often forget how they're being conned by big brands or social coercion.

Lucy's website is all about comparing foods and doing a visual food comparisons to prove her point.

1. Check out the calorie similarities between a hand full of almonds and fruit pastels.

Both snacks have the same calories. Which one would you pick?⠀ ⠀

""Many would choose the almonds for the nutritional value or the flavour - which is totally fine. Many would choose the almonds because even though they'd prefer Fruit Pastels, almonds would make them feel more ‘on track’ mentally - which again, is totally fine "" she wrote, explaining the difference.

""When the majority of my diet has consisted of well-balanced food that’s full of micronutrients, I have no issue eating something that’s less so just because I love the taste of it. This is just a personal choice… ‘Healthy’ to me is exactly what I make it. And Fruit Pastels (in moderation) make me happy which I believe contributes largely to my overall health.”

5. White Americano versus flat white

“It’s often surprising how many calories are in coffees and hot drinks – a large Starbucks Flat White is 290 calories and a latte is 300. If weight-loss is your goal, a simple swap like ordering a white Americano instead will save you 250 calories.”

8. Fat loss food versus fattening food

“No single food will cause weight-gain. Eating more calories than you’re expending constantly over a period of time will do this. Equally, no single food will cause weight-loss. Eating less calories than you’re expending constantly over a period of time will do this.”

The Economic Times,"Why bitcoins are headed for a rough ride The notoriously volatile cryptocurrency, whose 160 percent surge this year has captivated everyone from Wall Street bankers to Chinese grandmothers, could be headed for one of its most turbulent stretches yet. Blame the bitcoin civil war. After two years of largely behind-the-scenes bickering, rival factions of computer whizzes who play key roles in bitcoin’s upkeep are poised to adopt two competing software updates at the end of the month. That has raised the possibility that bitcoin will split in two, an unprecedented event that would send shockwaves through the $41 billion market.

"Chinese firms may feel CEA power pinch, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: Away from the high Himalayas, where Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a face-off over border dispute, the government appears to be gearing up to tighten the screws in an area where the ‘dragon’ may feel the pinch – electrical equipment supplies.The Central Electricity Authority is drafting a roadmap for securing India’s power stations and smart grid systems against cyber attacks with conditions that could make it difficult for Chinese companies to compete for contracts.The move comes within three months of power minister Piyush Goyal saying the government would invoke the principle of reciprocity when awarding future contracts. Though he did not name China , the industry read it as an inference to the Chinese classifying power as a strategic sector to keep foreign companies out.On Friday, CEA chairman R K Verma told TOI the authority was working on a report to secure the country’s power systems but stressed “it is not aimed against any particular country”. “Securing the country’s electrical system against tampering is our main concern. We are in the final stage of preparing the report. It is not against any one country but against all those who want to harm or tamper with our system,” he said.Verma declined to comment on the conditions CEA is prescribing. But a Reuters report said the conditions could require companies to have been present in India for 10 years, have Indian citizens at the top and certain period of Indian domicile for employees. Companies may also be asked to disclose source of inputs for transmission systems and mandatory tests for malware.These conditions, if they finally pass the government’s muster, are unlikely to hurt most of the European or US companies since most of them have been around for long, either with a subsidiary or through joint ventures. But the conditions can also be open to challenge at WTO.Chinese power gear makers have enjoyed a good run so far, taking advantage of low domestic manufacturing capacity to bag major contracts as India went on a spree to build power plants. While import of Chinese generation equipment has levelled out, cyber security has emerged as a key concern after Chinese companies bagged smart grid contracts for 18 cities and are competing for many others as first reported by TOI on January 21.A concerned Centre ordered countrywide cyber security audit of power distribution and generation systems as state grids and plants increasingly turned smarter with large-scale deployment of digital technology, as first reported by TOI on May 8."
"Single use medical devices: Mumbai: FIRs against 37 hospitals for reusing devices, patients to be reimbursed, Health News, ET HealthWorld","MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has filed complaints against 37 hospitals across the state for reusing single-use medical devices and overcharging patients, said minister for consumer protection Girish Bapat . The government is also working on ways to refund patients who were unfairly charged for reused devices, he announced in the legislative council on Tuesday.Moreover, to prevent such incidents from recurring in hospitals, the state government plans to develop a web portal that will record every medical device’s journey—right from its purchase to use and re-use.“The web portal will keep a track of each medical device from the moment it is purchased, the medical institute it is sold to, and its use,” said Bapat, replying to a query raised by Congress MLC Satej Patil during question hour. The minister added that discussions with the Medical Council of India, the Drug Council of India and secretary of the public health department on the issue are in the final stages.The announcement follows special investigations by the state Food and Drug Administration in May-June that showed many private hospitals charged premium charges from patients for reused cardiac catheters and guidewires; most of these devices are only meant for single use.In April, the state FDA had found three city hospitals guilty of not only reusing medical devices meant for single use, but also charging multiple patients for the same. Fortis Hospital in Mulund, Hiranandani Hospital in Vashi, which is managed by the Fortis group, and BSES Hospital in Andheri were later issued show-cause notices for violating the Drug and Cosmetics Act.On Tuesday, when Patil pointed out that a few hospitals have already reused implant devices and cheated patients, the minister assured him that the government would get information about such cases and refund those patients."

"Now, energy efficient appliances to be available at petrol pumps, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: In a bid to boost the government’s Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All (UJALA) scheme, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) under the ministry of power today signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Oil Marketing Companies ( OMCs ) for distribution of energy-efficient appliances across petrol pumps.According to the agreement, the distribution of energy efficient appliances including LED bulbs , LED tube lights and energy efficient fans will be taken up at select retail outlets of Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ), Hindustan Petroleum Corp ( HPCL ) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation ( BPCL ).“Both UJALA & Ujjwala are clean energy movements aimed at making lives of poor easier. The MoU between EESL and OMCs is a partnership for the smart people who want to save electricity,” Power, coal, renewable energy and mines minister Piyush Goyal said at the signing ceremony.Goyal also added India would be the first country in the world to shift 100 per cent to using LEDs for its lighting needs by 2019. As part of the pact, EESL will make the entire upfront investment for ensuring availability of the products at the outlets and no upfront capital cost will be borne by OMCs barring manpower and space, EESL said in a statement.“The consumer can purchase high quality 9 Watt LED bulbs for Rs 70, 20 Watt LED tube light for Rs 220 and five-star rated ceiling fans for Rs 1,200,” EESL said. The power ministry aims to use the vast network of the three-public sector OMCs of over 54,500 petrol Retail Outlets (ROs) throughout India.Currently, over 255 million LED bulbs, over 3.6 million LED tubelights and around 1.15 million energy efficient fans have been distributed in the country under the UJALA scheme . This has resulted in annual energy savings of over 33,400 million units of power and avoided peak demand of 6,725 MW, the statement added.According to EESL, the scheme is estimated to lead to cumulative cost reduction in bills of consumers of over Rs 13,346 crore annually apart from reduction of around 27 million tonne of carbon emissions every year."

Stats: India's towering presence against out-of-form Sri Lanka

Deepu Narayanan • Last updated on Sat, 19 Aug, 2017, 12:15 PM

The league stage encounter between India and Sri Lanka at the Kennington Oval in the recently concluded Champions Trophy had a special significance attached to it - India and Sri Lanka became the first sides to play against each other in 150 ODIs. Such has been the profusion of India-Sri Lanka ODIs since the 2000s - 88 of them - that at one point in Virat Kohli's career, more than half of his games were against the island nation.

Though the two sides have locked horns more than any other sides in the recent past, the contests on the field haven't lived up to the expectations. While Sri Lanka have a slight edge over India in the multi-nation tournaments, it has been a one-way traffic in the bilateral meets. Consider this stat - the last time Sri Lanka won a bilateral ODI series against India (3-0 at home in 1997), Mahela Jayawardene was yet to make his ODI debut (he finished with 448 ODI caps, second most by any player in history).

India - SL ODIs post 2000

India won seven out of the eight bilateral rubbers against Sri Lanka post-2005 with the other one ending in a 0-0 draw with rain playing spoilsport. Not only have they won the series, India's domination in this period has been so overriding that Sri Lanka have won more than one match in a series, only once (win margins for India being 6-1, 2-1, 3-2, 4-1, 3-1, 4-1 and 5-0). Things haven't been that different in Sri Lanka as well, as India's win-loss record of 11-4 in Sri Lanka in the last ten years indicate the same.

Sri Lanka average over 47 with the ball against India in bilateral ODIs, nearly 19 points higher than what they average with the willow against them. The difference of 18.85 between Sri Lanka's bowling and batting average is the second highest in bilateral series among top eight teams since 2005. The only higher difference in bilateral ODIs is the one between South Africa and West Indies - 30.71. The next worst for Sri Lanka against an opposition is 13.82, against South Africa (batting average 27.76 and bowling average 41.58).

Out of the 16 times in the 37 ODIs India batted first, eight times they crossed 300. Spin bowling, considered the backbone of the Sri Lankan bowling attack over the years and the way Indian batsmen subjugated them, dictated the results in India's favour. Barring Ajantha Mendis who weaved a web over the Indian batsmen when he initially burst onto the scene, no other Sri Lankan spinner averaged less than 35 against India - the great Muttiah Muralitharan averaged 35 in bilateral ODIs against the familiar foes.

Lasith Malinga is all set to play his 200th ODI and he is just two scalps away from the 300-wicket mark. However, the problem for the hosts is the inexperience of the other bowlers in the squad - all the 14 have a combined 291 ODI wickets, seven less than Malinga's individual tally. Angelo Mathews and Thisara Perera have contributed 240 of those and it's a welcome news for Sri Lanka that he will bowl in this series.

The challenge for Malinga will be that he will be up against the two batsmen who have dominated him the most in limited-overs cricket - Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. Kohli has scored 180 off 169 balls off him, getting dismissed just once, while Dhoni has 186 off 167 deliveries against three dismissals. As a result, Malinga's overall ODI numbers against India are few notches below his overall numbers - averages 41.92 against India in comparison to 28.39 in his career.

Apart from Kohli and Dhoni who average 54.59 and 61.40 against Sri Lanka, Shikhar Dhawan has been another thorn in the eye for them. In nine innings against Sri Lanka, he averages 69.44 with two hundreds and four fifties including a 125 which came during their recent Champions Trophy clash. Angelo Mathews is one Sri Lankan batsman who has done remarkably well against India, scoring 935 runs from 28 innings at 46.75 and a strike rate in excess of 90. However, their skipper Upul Tharanga averages only 29.62 against India.

Sri Lanka have won only one out of the nine bilateral series against Full Member sides since the start of 2015 - against a weak West Indies side at home in 2015. The nine rubbers include a series loss to Zimbabwe and a shared trophy against Bangladesh - two oppositions Sri Lanka used to steamroll on their heydays from the past. With at least two wins needed to secure a direct qualification for the 2019 World Cup, Sri Lanka will have their task cut out against their bogey opposition from the recent past.

"Solar eclipse presents first major test of power grid in renewable era, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","By Ruthy Munoz

HOUSTON: As Monday's total solar eclipse sweeps from Oregon to South Carolina, U.S. electric power and grid operators will be glued to their monitoring systems in what for them represents the biggest test of the renewable energy era.

Utilities and grid operators have been planning for the event for years, calculating the timing and drop in output from solar, running simulations of the potential impact on demand, and lining up standby power sources. It promises a critical test of their ability to manage a sizeable swing in renewable power.

Solar energy now accounts for more than 42,600 megawatts (MW), about 5 percent of the U.S.'s peak demand, up from 5 MW in 2000, according to the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), a group formed to improve the nation's power system in the wake of a 1964 blackout. When the next eclipse comes to the United States in 2024, solar will account for 14 percent of the nation's power, estimates NERC.

For utilities and solar farms, the eclipse represents an opportunity to see how well prepared their systems are to respond to rapid swings in an era where variable energy sources such as solar and wind are climbing in scale and importance.

Power companies view Monday's event as a ""test bed"" on how power systems can manage a major change in supply, said John Moura, director of reliability assessment and system analysis at the North American Electric Reliability Corp.

""It has been tested before, just not at this magnitude,"" adds Steven Greenlee, a spokesman for the California Independent System Operator (CISO), which controls routing power in the nation's most populous state.

CISO estimates that at the peak of the eclipse, the state's normal solar output of about 8,800 MW will be reduced to 3,100 MW and then surge to more than 9,000 MW when the sun returns.

CISO's preparation includes studying how German utilities dealt with a 2015 eclipse in that country. Its review prompted the grid overseer to add an additional 200 MW to its normal 250 MW power reserves.

""We've calculated that during the eclipse, that solar will ramp off at about 70 MW per minute,"" said Greenlee. ""And then we'll see the solar rolling back at about 90 MW per minute or more.""

Power utilities say the focus will be on managing a rapid drop off and accommodate the solar surge post the eclipse. Utility executives say they do not expect any interruption in service, but are prepared to ask customers to pare usage if a problem arises.""We want to assure our customers that we have secured enough resources to meet their energy needs, even with significantly less solar generation on hand,"" said Caroline Winn, chief operating officer at utility San Diego Gas & Electric Co.

In the Eastern United States, utilities will have more time to watch the results of their Western counterparts. PJM Interconnection, which coordinates electricity transmission among 13 states from Michigan to North Carolina, says non-solar sources such as hydro and fossil fuel can easily supplant the 400 MW to 2,500 MW solar loss, depending on the cloud cover.

For small-scale solar providers, the eclipse is a drop in the revenue bucket. Ron Strom, a North Carolina real estate developer, sells the power from a 58 kilovolt system atop a commercial property in Chapel Hill to Duke Energy.

""The event may cost me eighteen cents or thereabouts if my panels don't produce solar for three hours,"" said Strom."

Australia recall Faulkner, Coulter-Nile for India tour

Australia have recalled all-rounder James Faulkner and pacer Nathan Coulter-Nile for their upcoming tour of India. While Faulkner makes his way back to the ODI squad, Coulter-Nile finds a place in squads of both the limited-overs formats. The T20I squad also includes uncapped left-arm pacer Jason Beherendorff, who averages 19.47 for his 53 scalps in 38 T20s.

Left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Starc, meanwhile, continues his recovery from an injury to his right foot away from the game. The spearhead of Australia's bowling attack sustained the injury midway through Australia's Test tour of India early this year. He played the Champions Trophy but has been given more time to return to his best.

With the upcoming Ashes series in mind, Starc has not been included in Australia's two-Test tour of Bangladesh (starting from August 27) as well as the India tour.

Australian team physiotherapist David Beakley explained that that the fast bowler's recovery has been slower than expected: ""We have recently reviewed the progress of Mitchell's right foot injury and the healing process has been slower than we would have liked.""

""Consequently, in order to ensure his best possible preparation for the Ashes, he will be unavailable for the Tour of India and will continue his rehab in Australia with an aim to have him play for New South Wales in the domestic one-day cup.""

Australia are scheduled to play five ODIs and three T20Is in India during the months of September and October this year.

ODI squad: Steve Smith, David Warner, Aaron Finch, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Travis Head, Matthew Wade, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, James Faulkner, Josh Hazlewood, Ashton Agar, Hilton Cartwright, Adam Zampa T20I squad: Steve Smith, David Warner, Jason Behrendorff, Daniel Christian, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, Aaron Finch, Travis Head, Moises Henriques, Glenn Maxwell, Tim Paine, Kane Richardson, Adam Zampa

After constantly being laid low by injuries, Coulter-Nile found success while representing Kolkata Knight Riders during IPL 2017. The fast bowler, who bagged 15 wickets in eight games for KKR, is expected to make a big impression during the India tour. Cricket Australia selector Trevor Hohns talked up Coulter-Nile's return while also praising all-rounder Faulkner's familiarity with the sub-continent.

""Nathan brings raw pace to the side with good variation. It is great to see him back from injury and we are hopeful he will have a big impact in this series. ""James Faulkner is a solid One-Day campaigner and is very familiar with sub-continent conditions, coming off a very good tour of Sri Lanka last year. We hope that he will take his chance in returning to the one-day side,"" Hohns said.

Cricket Australia have also invested some amount of faith in Western Australia all-rounder Hilton Cartwright, picking him in both the squads. Cartwright, who made his Test debut for Australia earlier this year, comes with the reputation of being a big-hitter and is expected to slot into the shorter format with ease.

""Hilton is an aggressive striker of the ball and we think his game will be well suited to the transition to short-form cricket,"" Hohns opined.

While wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Paine has kept his T20I spot despite poor outings with the bat during the home series against Sri Lanka in February, all-rounder Daniel Christian braces himself for a return to the national side after more than three years.

It is a standard procedure for the group to follow international competitive bidding (ICD) route for major capital expenditures to ensure transparency and competitiveness in the process,” the company said.Maken said on February 5, 2013, the UPA government initiated an inquiry into the practice of over-invoicing on import of electrical equipment/ machinery by a subsidiary of the Adani Enterprises Ltd . On the basis of the probe, a 97-page showcause notice was issued to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Ltd, he said.The report submitted by DRI has been put in public domain and a recent expose by a reputed international publication makes it clear that the DRI report names the Adani Group, he said.Maken alleged the NDA government “decided to go slow on this important matter, and as a result, till today, the investigation has not reached its logical end.”"

Tirunelveli stands second at 15.16%, South Chennai has 13.99% loss and North Chennai 11.50%.These are the findings of the first-ever region-wise analysis of power distribution loss in the state. Distribution loss occurs owing to old meters, old cables as well as power theft. The total distribution loss in Tamil Nadu is estimated to be 12.91%. With the changing of old meters with digital ones, the loss is likely to reduce in the coming years.Trichy region comprises Cauvery delta region and Karur district.""Farmers' connections in delta districts don't have meters and most of them use higher horse power pumps. For example, if a farmer has been permitted to use a 5 horse power pump, he would be using a 10 horse power pump. The extra power used is accounted for as distribution loss,"" a senior Tangedco official told TOI.Tangedco estimates that farm power connections could be the main reason for Trichy region topping the distribution loss chart.In urban areas, the loss is owing to old cables and meters.""We have a target to lower the distribution loss in urban areas to single digit percentage, but in rural areas we hope to bring it down to 4%,"" said the official. In urban areas, apart from digital meters, the discom will also set up modern sub-stations to reduce distribution loss.""Though the investment to set up modern sub-stations like gas insulated switchgear (GIS) is high, such infrastructure needs less land and it will also lower distribution loss.

By Barbara Lewis

LONDON: Anglo American is placing a contrarian bet on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as it tries to squeeze more profit from its platinum reserves, but risks being left behind as rival miners look to cash in on battery-powered cars.

A push, particularly in Europe and China, for lower-emission transport raises the prospect of weaker demand for platinum, whose biggest industrial use is in diesel vehicles.

Other big miners are positioning themselves for the shift away from the combustion engine by betting on lithium and cobalt, both used in electric vehicle batteries.

Glencore signed a major deal last October to sell 20,000 tonnes of cobalt products, a hitherto niche material whose production it dominates, while Rio Tinto is sitting on a large deposit of lithium.

As the world's top supplier of platinum, Anglo American is left with little choice but to remain committed to the metal. But it sees strength in what others may perceive as a weakness.



""Platinum and palladium will long play a critical air quality role in the global vehicle fleet, including in heavy commercial vehicles, hybrids and the emerging hydrogen fuel cell electric technology,"" CEO Mark Cutifani told Reuters.

The firm has modernised operations, aiming to mechanise at least 70 percent of its platinum mining to boost efficiency. Cutifani is relentlessly pursuing a target of 15 percent return on capital, up from 4 percent in the first half of this year.

It has also invested $110 million on encouraging technologies that use platinum, setting up partnerships with innovators, and lobbying governments to provide more infrastructure for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

Instead of relying on a battery, such vehicles convert hydrogen into electricity using a fuel cell, in which platinum acts as a catalyst. Water is the only emission.

Each vehicle would need between 10-15 grams of platinum, Anglo estimates, compared with around 7 grams in the catalytic converters of an average diesel car.

WILL THE BET PAY OFF?

China has set a target of 1 million hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2030, which Anglo says would require 300,000 troy ounces of platinum, about 10 percent of current auto demand and a chunk of its annual production of more than 2 million ounces.

But so far the take-up of hydrogen vehicles is tiny, and industry experts say their wider use is years away at best, with high purchase prices and a lack of refuelling stations the major barriers.

Anglo says its lobbying is nonetheless paying off.

Britain, for example, announced a 23 million pound ($30 million) fund to accelerate the take-up of hydrogen vehicles and has pledged to expand the refuelling network from a dozen stations nationwide so far.

Cutifani meanwhile joined forces with CEOs from the motor, chemical and oil industries who launched the Hydrogen Council lobbying group at the start of this year.

Toyota, which backs fuel cells because it does not want to be dependent on a single technology, was among those represented.



The Japanese car maker sees advantages in hydrogen vehicles' greater range and faster refuelling compared with battery power, although it has said it expects the technology to reach the mainstream only by the mid-to-late 2020s.

It is also seeking to reduce the amount of platinum needed to keep down costs.

Volumes of platinum used in fuel cells per car have been falling for the last 10 years, Toyota's director of advanced technologies Craig Scott told Reuters, and are likely to drop further through technology or the use of alternative metals.

BOTTOM LINE

At the height of the platinum market around a decade ago, when prices soared above $2,000 an ounce, the metal accounted for nearly 30 percent of Anglo's core earnings (EBITDA).

That share has fallen to less than 10 percent as the price of platinum has dropped to around $980 an ounce. Anglo has cut costs and reorganised its portfolio, selling off some assets including its Rustenburg platinum mine in South Africa, a flashpoint of union violence.

Cutifani said there were no plans to expand the platinum business. But it is a significant contributor to earnings that could boost shareholder returns in the event of a platinum rally.

That may be a long wait.

Frances Hudson, an investment director at Aberdeen Standard, which holds Anglo American shares, said the short-term consensus was for weak prices for most of the commodities the firm holds.

""But the company's portfolio of long-life and mainly low cost assets (diamonds, copper and platinum) should be fine on a three-to-five year outlook as supplies tighten,"" she said.

Anglo is focused in the meantime on raising the value of every ounce of platinum it mines. Investors are waiting to see whether it is a bet that pays off.

""The market believes in electric vehicles. The market is sceptical about fuel cells. Anglo could be right, but the market has yet to be convinced,"" said Chris LaFemina, a managing director specialised in mining at Jefferies bank.

"NPPA may lose absolute power to fix drug prices under new policy, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: The government proposes to revamp the country’s drug pricing regulator, allowing it to set prices of only essential medicines.The latest draft proposals suggest amendments to the drug pricing policy and inducting advisory body of experts in a move to strengthen the regulatory body, but at the same time may take away its absolute power to fix drug prices in public interest.Last year, Niti Aayog , the health ministry and the Department of Pharmaceuticals ( DoP ) were engaged in discussions to dissolve NPPA in its current form and reallocate it within the department. This proposal did not materialise.NPPA presently functions as an autonomous body that regulates prices of medicines under the National List of Essential Medicines and also monitors the prices of those that are not on the list. DoP’s latest draft pharma policy suggested that NPPA can cap prices of only those drugs included in the NLEM. The NPPA should lay down and enforce price ceilings of “selected medicines” and ensure that “adequate quantities” of the drugs are available.“National List of Essential Medicines will remain the basis of the medicines to be brought under price regulation… the Department of Pharmaceuticals will prepare the list of medicines for price regulation and transmit them to the NPPA for fixing the price ceilings,” according to the latest draft of the pharmaceuticals policy, a copy of which ET has seen.Appeals against NPPA’s decisions will lie with the government, while appeals against the government’s decisions will be decided by the judiciary.“On pricing, it seems to propose broad changes to the functions and processes of NPPA. The draft appears to impose greater oversight on NPPA such as review of all its decisions, which could mean greater say over NPPA’s ability to cap prices in public interest also,” said Malini Aisola, a member of the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), a civil society group. Some groups said the proposals would dilute the powers of NPPA.The draft may encourage profiteering if implemented as it proposes to weaken the powers of NPPA, Swadeshi Jagran Manch national co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan told ET. The Manch is an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. It said the proposed provisions and amendments shift several important decisions to the Central government.The draft policy, circulated for stakeholder views, suggests amending the drug pricing policy and inducting an advisory body of experts to strengthen the regulatory body. It seeks to improve access to affordable medicines, reduce dependence on other countries including China for raw material, improve manufacturing quality and create an ecosystem to support innovative new drugs.One recommendation is to reorient the Drug (Prices Control) Order, 2013, which NPPA currently follows for its pricing decisions, to shift focus from price control to monitoring of drug prices, their availability and accessibility.The Department of Pharmaceuticals will be able to direct usage of emergency powers under Para 19 of the DPCO to regulate prices of patented medicines that are not under compulsory licensing.NPPA used powers under Para 19 on Wednesday to slash prices of knee implants by up to 69%, citing “extraordinary circumstances” as the devices were not on the list of essential medicines and hadn’t been notified for price control.“Language of DPCO should be made more definitive. There should not be much scope for different interpretations,” according to the draft.Apart from civil society, industry and government representatives, the draft proposes that NPPA’s advisory body for pricing should consist of doctors, pharmacists and other experts. While NPPA won’t have to accept the recommendations of this body, it will be required to assign reasons in writing for modifying or rejecting them.Civil society groups such as AIDAN said they are studying the draft. “While on the one hand the draft has some positive initiatives to improve access to affordable medicines, in some instances it seems to push towards deregulation,” said Aisola.The Swadeshi Jagran Manch wrote to Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers Ananth Kumar on Wednesday, alleging that the Department of Pharmaceuticals is “working against” the stated objectives of the Prime Minister and the chemicals and fertilizers ministry."
"power sector: Loan sanctions have jumped 150 per cent in the first quarter: PV Ramesh, CMD, REC, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","In a chat with ET Now, PV Rames, CMD of Rural Electrification Corporation Limited, talks about his company's margins.

Coming to the margins, yes there has been a marginal decline in the margins. However,they continue to remain above 4% as far as NIM is concerned.t is one of the Lanco power projects. We have an overall exposure of about Rs 500 crore. but we are not the sole lenders. There are several other lenders. Our exposure as a proportion of the overall exposure is about 15%. We have made an appropriate provision as mandated by Reserve Bank of India and our gross NPA as proportion of our loan book is less than 2.6% and in net NPA it is sub 2%. Ours is a financial institution with a sole exposure to power sector which has the lowest NPAs among all the peers.Let me say categorically that we are grateful to the observations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General. We have carefully studied them and have taken note of those observations. It needs to be abundantly clarified that this is a joint report and pertains to our sister concern PFC. CAG has made pointed comments relating to REC and to PFC. In those observations that have been made, which have been erroneously in my view presented by some of the media outlets, says that we did not adhere to the RBI norms. But in the the same report CAG has stated that REC has adhered to the RBI norms."

Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story,"SPOTLIGHT Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story Vishaal Loganathan Share Tweet Share

All of 15 when the tsunami hit, Dinesh Chandimal saw, lost, won and lived through it, as he intends to do the same for Sri Lankan cricket now © Getty

As a 15-year-old, Dinesh Chandimal sat at home and watched on TV as Sri Lanka were handed a hammering by New Zealand in Auckland. More than 10000 kilometers away, in Ambalangoda, Chandimal was watching intently hoping to gather whatever points he could. He had to. Chandimal had packed his bags and his cricketing gear the day earlier. He had been called up for the trials for the Sri Lankan Under-15 team. It was to be one of the first steps towards realising a lifelong goal.

It was a poya, full moon day, and as usual the house was being cleaned. Chandimal's mother had stepped out to clear the garbage. Moments later, he heard a screech from his mother. ""Actually, we thought it was a snake or something,"" says Chandimal. But it was the tsunami, or 'The Devil', as Chandimal constantly says.

Ambalangoda was one of the worst hit areas. The waves were more than 15 feet high and came in at a rapid pace. After the first wave had hit the village, the waters drew back, before coming back stronger and more menacingly. The devastation left thousands homeless, hopeless, hungry and frightened. It killed as many, if not more.

""We went there and saw, and one of the uncles in our village, he came and saw for just five seconds and said 'the tsunami has come as a devil'. He said to us 'Please run with your children.' He shouted to us. Then, we ran. Ran for, I think, 200-300 meters. Fortunately, there was a hill. So we ran to that hill and we stayed there. From there, we saw our home and everything going like foam.""

""The tsunami came as the devil,"" Chandimal repeatedly says while talking about that fateful day. Until then, he hadn't even heard the word 'tsunami'. The incidents and memories of that day are fresh and vivid in his mind, and the pain in his voice is all too apparent. He watched his house, his recently-packed kit bag and everything he and his family owned being washed away by the sea. It swallowed up everything, but it also left in its wake a swathe of dead bodies, people Chandimal would've known. Chandimal could only watch on helpless from atop a hill. He and his family were safe, for now.

In the aftermath of the tsunami, a shaken Chandimal went hunting for his kit bag. He had to travel to Colombo for the trials. He found his bag more than two kilometers away, wet and useless. Chandimal wasn't stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea, here the devil was the deep blue sea.

It left him and his family with mental scars that won't easily be erased. ""Of course, it's always at the back of our minds. After tsunami, we went to the sea only twice. That much we were scared as a family. But you know that's the way life goes...""

The events of December 26, 2004, strengthened Chandimal. His family was now without a house, without any clothes or food. It made him resolute, his family's well-being became his main focus and he ensured he reached his goal through cricket.

""One time, in 2004, we didn't have a house to stay. This is a hotel,"" he says, looking around the swanky MovenPick Hotel in Colombo. ""My parents and my family and myself, we put a lot of hard work for me to become a player and a captain. The word is hard work.""

""We were affected by tsunami. We lost everything. Tsunami came as the devil and broke everything. So actually that (motivated me) to become an international cricketer and become a good cricketer. So that was the strength I think, after the tsunami. Then I was thinking I have to stick to my cricket, then I put some target - I want to be this, I want to be this man, this player and stuff.

""One or two months, we struggled as a family. We didn't have a place to stay. (We had) food issues, some clothes issues... So, but I think that gave me really good (motivation) to become a good cricketer.""

So when the opportunity to take his cricket to the next level came calling, Chandimal accepted it, albeit with a heavy heart. The current Test captain was the star of his team, Dharmasoka College, with both bat and behind the wickets. ""My wicketkeeping was superb in that time, I was flying to take catches. No mistakes! Like now,"" he laughs.

Against Ananda College, he was the only player to show some fight, scoring 77 not out as the team folded for 120. The coach of Ananda College, Udayananda Perera, was soon at his house, asking his parents to send him to Colombo.

""Actually, my parents pushed me to go to Ananda College. I didn't want to go. Because in Dharmasoka College, it was my first school and I loved playing there, in my home town. My parents told me, 'If you're there (Ananda College), at least you can get a good job. So then, I said 'Okay, I should go now because we have so many family problems.' We didn't have a good home, actually. For six months, we stayed at the government apartments. We were there for six months. So then I felt 'Okay, I should go, I should come to Colombo and play cricket'.

At Ananda College, Chandimal put in the hard yards. His days in the hostel were far from a breeze. He was not with his family, and the food was not to his liking. But he ensured he always put on a smile when his family asked about him.

""I didn't know (anyone in Colombo). I stayed at the hostel, Ananda hostel, for 3-4 years. And I used to eat that hostel food. It's always tough (laughs). Sometimes my parents called me and asked 'Son, are you okay with the food? Are you okay with the stay?' But sometimes, I'm not okay with the food, sometimes I didn't take my breakfast because breakfast was not good to eat. But I didn't say anything to them. I said, 'Yes, I am fine'. And so that's the way I was there at the hostel.""

But it was not all gloom, either. Chandimal maintained a good relationship with everyone at the college, and he was repaid with kindness. He is not sure why, but ventures that maybe it was because of his good behaviour.

""There were the workers, they gave a lot of help to me. Sometimes, when I am not there, when I am out for practice, they make my food, and when I come to the hostel, they bring it to my room. They took care of me really well. I just love to talk the right things with the good people. I feel that's why they loved me.""

From running for his life to now running the country's Test team, Chandimal's life has been a ride full of ups and downs.

Even as captain of the Sri Lankan Test team, Chandimal goes through the bumps regularly. He was handed over the side after Angelo Mathews decided he could not handle captaincy any more. Soon after, he watched as his side suffered a whitewash at home to India. He still has utmost confidence in his team, and says it has the right ingredients. Now his focus is on ensuring all the players play with freedom, to rid his team of any fears, or problems.

""It's really an honour and a privilege to be the captain of Sri Lanka cricket team. I came with a really hard youth, tough times. I had tough times, good times. As a captain and a player, I just want to give the good things for my players. I just want to take care of them as my brothers. If something happens on the outside, I just want to control that and give good freedom to the youngsters to perform well.

""I just want to, as a captain, take the responsibility or blame. Anything from the outside and I'll get that as a captain. I just want to be relaxed and not put any pressure on my players. That is what I wanted to do. Because I know the hard times, when it comes to you. Actually, once I got my Test captaincy, I said to the players, 'I just want unity first, then attitude, focus, discipline and passion'. That's what I am always discussing with players and staff.""

Just like he did with his family, Chandimal always puts his team first. It's what he did when he was first made the captain too, in 2013.

""To be honest, I was struggling in 2014 with the pressure. Then after that I learnt a lot from that. How to handle the pressure. How to handle the people. How to handle players, how they're thinking and stuff. That gave me a lot of learning. Now, I can take more pressure, and give freedom to my players. 2013 was a tough time to captain the side, because in that time there were experienced players with a young side. I feel I handled it well. The thing is I didn't perform as a player, because I batted at number 6. In T20s, if you bat at number 6, you get only 2-3 overs. So you can't score big runs. You can get only 10-20 runs. As a captain, I had to open or bat at number 3, but I didn't want to do that.

""Because at that time, there was Kusal Janith (Perera). He was playing outstanding (cricket). So then I thought it is better to play Kusal as opener with Dilshan, there's a left-right hand opening combination. Then we had Mahela, then Sangakkara, then Angelo. I wanted to put the most experienced players in the first 10-15 overs. Then, myself at 6. I didn't think about myself, I just thought about the team. How to win. How to lift the World Cup for my mother country. So that's what I always think as a captain. I don't care about my performance, I don't care about my position. That's my first experience as captain in 2013-14.

Now Chandimal captains the Test side without any of the big names who were around in 2013. He's left shouldering the nation's hopes alongside an oft-injured and probably mentally-drained Mathews, and the ageing Rangana Herath. With the team failing to put up a fight, the task has only gotten harder for Chandimal.

""It's always hard, mate. Specially when you're losing games. There are so many questions, but if you're winning - no questions. When you are doing the right things, I feel we are doing so many bad mistakes. When we are not doing well, we don't do any mistakes. It's always tough. Maybe at the moment, we are like that. We are looking forward to get the good results in the future, within six months or one year.

""If you're playing international cricket, as a player, mental toughness is very important because these days, there's so much media and social media (pressure). Someone doesn't like you and they shout at you and stuff. As a player, you have to keep yourself mentally right and at the same time, you have to do your homework as a batsman or bowler.""

In 2004, Dinesh Chandimal stood on a hill and watched in horror his house being flooded and then being washed away. He resolved to fight for his family and take care of them. He did that through his cricket. Even now, when he speaks to his parents, they credit him for putting them back on their feet. ""They tell me every time I meet them, 'now we are in a good position, that's because of you.' And I say, 'No, not because of me, because of we all put our hard work in as a family. That's why we are here, not only because of me.'""

Now his goals have changed. In 2017, he stands as Sri Lanka's captain and watches as his side slips in one shocking performance after another. He again resolves to fight for his team, and take care of them. He must be the right man to take them forward. Because when you've seen, lost, won and lived through what he's seen, lost, won and lived through, fighting and succeeding is in your blood.

A Miracle! Saints Injured In Utkal Express Derailment Thank Muslims For Saving Their Lives,"The derailment of Utkal Express near Muzaffarnagar took 23 lives and left many injured, but the accident paved way for an exemplary episode of communal harmony where people helped one another. One example of it came to fore when saints travelling in the train was rescued by local Muslims.

""I remember my head bumping into the seat in front of me, throwing me at least two feet forward. I was in pain and could her screams from all directions. Honestly, if it hadn't been for Muslims in the area who rushed to the spot and pulled us out of the train's coach, we might not have survived,"" said Bhagwan Das Maharaj, a saint with a saffron cloth tied around his neck. He was travelling with six other ascetics who had boarded the Utkal Express from Morana in Madhya Pradesh and were going to Haridwar to take a holy dip in Ganga.

""They brought us water, khaats and arranged for a private doctor for us. We will never forget this gesture,"" he added. Three saints from the group were injured and were rushed to Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College in Meerut for treatment.

""We believe in God and we saw his power soon after the accident. There are times when people politicize Hindu-Muslim ties, but there has always been love between the two communities,"" said Morni Das, another saint.

Soon after 14 coaches of Haridwar-bound Kalinga Utkal Express derailed near Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar, government and private hospitals in Meerut were put on alert and emergency wards were set up for the accident victims. ""There were many women and children in our coach. All of us were chit-chatting and suddenly our coach overturned. Initially, we didn't realize what had happened,"" said another saint Hakim Das.

Dr Raj Kumar Chaudhary, Meerut's chief medical officer, said, ""As many as 23 people have been taken to different hospitals in Meerut and are being given treatment. Also, 26 government ambulances and 26 private ambulances were rushed to the accident site to take the victims to hospitals.""

How to help bankrupt realtor’s customers,"Insolvency proceedings against debt-ridden Jaypee Infratech have left over 30,000 home buyers in the lurch. They need more than state sympathy. Home buyers have been advised to file a claim with the Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal. However, as unsecured claimants, home buyers have limited rights under the bankruptcy code. They are akin to customers who have placed orders and paid advances to a manufacturing company that goes under liquidation. In the pecking order of rights, the code allows the proceeds from the sale of assets to be distributed to secured lenders (read: banks), to pay off workmen’s dues for a period of 24 months before the liquidation commencement date, to pay wages and any unpaid dues owed to employees other than workmen, and to clear financial debts owed to unsecured creditors.

How can home buyers who have made payment in full or in part be given their homes? The assets now belong to the banks. If the liquidation proceeds are large enough to pay off secured creditors and employees and still have enough left over to repay home buyers their infructuous advances, well and good. Suppose that is not the case. What incentive do the banks or the IRP have to invest fresh funds to complete the construction of homes, payments for which have gone to the bankrupt firm and will not come to the new owner?

Why should banks part with assets that they have taken possession of under the law, to recover their unpaid dues? Bankers are unlikely to be moved by home buyers’ tears: the CBI might raid them for causing an avoidable loss.

There is one way out: raise the floor area ratio for the project, build and sell additional homes to generate the funds needed to complete stalled construction."

The dilemma that Charlottesville poses for us,"Most of us may not know where Charlottesville is in the United States. I have no hesitation in admitting I didn’t till the events of 12th August rocked not just that country, but the rest of the world as well. More than the events themselves, it was the Trump response and the reactions to that, which has lessons for us here at home.

The Charlottesville incident involved an ISIS style attack by a lone 20 year old white nationalist who deliberately mowed down a group of counter protesters with his car. They were confronting Neo- Nazi White Supremacists holding a rally objecting to the shifting of a statue of General Robert E Lee from a public park. It resulted in the death of 32 year old woman, Heather D Heyer, and injuries to nineteen others. That apart, there were fist fights aplenty between both sides as well as against the Police that was attempting to control the outbreak of violence.

General Lee headed the Confederate Armies from June 1861 till his surrender to General Ulysses S Grant in April 1865 that resulted in the collapse of the South and end to the Civil War. Ironically, while he may have now become a rallying point for the ‘Alt Right’ he famously wrote to his wife in 1856, years before the Civil War that “In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country.”[i] Though, it must be added that he did, by no means, actively oppose slavery and in fact owned hundreds of slaves on his wife’s Plantation, Arlington. Interestingly, he was also opposed to the idea of Confederate monuments writing a year before his death in 1870 that “not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife.”[ii]

Obviously, Trump with little understanding or knowledge of the Civil War and its consequences has been foolish enough to equate the actions of the Neo-Nazis to those who opposed them. That his actions have earned him much opprobrium, not just from those politically opposed to him, but also from leaders of his own Republican Party, as well as from members of the international community. Indeed, it appears there has now been a general realization among vast swathes of American society, including those of Indian origin, they may have voted the wrong guy in. They did this in their earnestness to oppose the perceived ill-effects of globalization and the actions of the liberal left leaning establishment that appeared to be favouring minorities and others at the cost of Middle America. Little did they realize that they may have voted in an unstable egotistic racist bigot with an extremely narrow world view. He appears to be bent on feathering his own nest with little or no moral qualms and completely uncaring as to the consequences of his actions. While speaking on the unfortunate incident, he even had the temerity to plug his own winery located there!

By his present actions, and even his statements given during campaigning, he has emboldened White Supremacists and other Alt-Right groups, his core electoral base, which has resulted in increasing attacks on religious and ethnic minorities. In the process he has also put his closest aides in the White House and members of his Cabinet on the horns of a moral dilemma. Should they continue to work for him in the hope that they would be able to control his most destructive actions or should they adopt a more honest and moral line and resign? The saving grace, however, has been the fact that there have been some in Government and from his Party who have refused to be bullied and have called him out. We even have had the Armed Forces Chiefs forthrightly condemn the Neo Nazis, though they have taken care not to embarrass their Commander-in-Chief by naming him, something completely unimaginable here.

Strident attacks by hardline right wing groups is not a phenomenon restricted just to the United States but has impacted most corners of the globe. In our own Nation we are witness to rising intolerance on the part of the Hindutva Brigade that is reflected in the increasing attacks on minorities and Dalits as well as restrictions on what we can wear, eat or watch. That vigilantism is supported, if not encouraged, by the establishment in some of the States only adds to our problems. Other than ineffectual statements Mr. Modi has done little to control the upsurge of violence. That our politicians lack empathy for the marginalized is clearly seen from the manner in which the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh devoted himself to organizing a religious festival at the time his State was reeling from the most terrible of tragedies, the death of seventy children at a Government Hospital in Gorakhpur leaves one speechless.

Even in Sierra Leone, which is still recovering from decades of brutal civil war, the Government was prompt in declaring a week of national mourning after mud slides wiped away villages and killed hundreds. That is how civilized governments react to tragedy, something that seems to have escaped our political leadership here. They seem to be capable of only engaging in verbal jousts with each other over insignificant issues and have no interest in dealing with the difficult business of governance which allowed for this horrendous breach of faith.

If just seven months of a Trump Presidency can tear holes into a 241 year old democracy, just think as to how vulnerable and fragile our democracy is after just seventy years of Independence. Unlike Trump Prime Minister Modi is far more restrained and mature but there are similarities in the manner that they have handled the violent acts indulged in by members of the nationalist far right who seem to revel in the politics of exclusion. The end result of their actions is not difficult to foresee as it can only add to existing fissiparous tendencies and further vitiate an already difficult internal security situation.

Finally, it creates a dilemma for the average liberal voter who may have supported Mr. Modi in the last General Elections. In 2019 he will be faced with a Hobson’s choice, given that the opposition has failed to deal with the twin abominations of dynastic politics and corruption. There also appear to be none within the establishment who would be willing to challenge those who are deliberately supporting forces of hate and pseudo nationalism. That can hardly bode well for either our democratic institutions or our future.

"Need to blend healthcare and technology for the hospital, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Technology enabled care is growing rapidly today

ByDirector Operations, Primecare INDIA, Bangalore mobile devices , and related technologies are presenting new opportunities in health care to better diagnose, monitor, and manage patients and treatment. Many providers employ these technologies along a continuum of wellness and prevention, to therapeutic remedies and treatments for illness. Some examples of current innovations include:Thanks to rapid advances in technology, today our doctors can diagnose, monitor and consult a patient from a distance through advanced telemedicine technology, videoconferencing, remote monitoring and other methods.Adoption of EMR (Electronic Medical Records) system has enabled the hospital and doctors to share patient health records such as prescriptions, lab reports, X-rays, CT, MRIs, Medical information through e-report by just a click.With the help of Electronic Medical Record/Electronic Health Records (EMR/HER) all risk factors such as loss of critical information, mismanagement of health records are ruled out. Patient files or patient records are being kept in databases securely. This is keeping with the best practices which have become a norm for doctors and hospitals today.“We live in an age in which every moment counts heavily and the price of delay is human lives.”At Hospital usage of technology advancements in Lab & Radiology diagnostics has substantially assisted in patient management. The technological advancements in the field of Radiology have transformed diagnosis interpretation. Earlier, the results used to take three to five days to reach the ordering physician but now it reaches within a short period of just thirty minutes. This advancement is of great gain because now, the interpreted report will reach the ordering physician quick enough to treat the patient in a shorter time span. All of this will prevent diseases from spreading to others’ and in turn save many lives. Due to advancement in technology, comprehensive information helps in accurate diagnosis and enables physicians to create an effective treatment plan and gain control over patients’ health during critical stages is much more accurate and fast. Following best practices have become a norm for doctors and hospitals today. Hospital Health Information System (HIS) technology focuses mainly on the administrational needs of the hospital. HIS is another integrated information system implemented in hospitals to manage all aspects of hospital’s operations like appointment scheduling, patient billing, financial accounting, patient visits for outpatient care, in an emergency, admission either a short stay or long in duration, medication therapy evaluation in inpatients care settings, OT management, Lab information system (LIS), pharmacy management, inventory management, resource management and corresponding processing of services is efficiently managed with the help of HIS. Hospital generate a wealth of data round the clock, 365 days a year, all of which needs to be well managed to ensure efficient functioning of hospital. Thanks to the IT for making healthcare look more organized and professional.We certainly can’t deny the benefits of technology in healthcare. Among the advantages of technology in healthcare we can also count the decline in preventable death cases, along with a general improvement of patients’ well-being. Treatment and recovery time have been reduced significantly. Medical technology doesn’t only affect patient’s quality of life; it also affects the lives of thousands of medical professionals and students spend time in training to become medical experts.From a bigger perspective, innovative health technology is helping us grow the world economy. More and more entrepreneurs and business owners have started to invest in medical technology today. If we are to widely consider the question, how has technology changed healthcare? There is no straightforward response since it’s an ongoing process. All we know is that it’s becoming a huge focus on world economies."

"Lights out: Solar Eclipse to have big impact on California power, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","SACRAMENTO: When the moon passes in front of the sun during Monday's eclipse California will lose enough solar energy to power more than 1.5 million homes.

The figure underscores the state's growing reliance on energy from the sun. For about three hours Monday, there will be diminished solar power available.

California has rapidly deployed renewable energy and now produces 40 percent of the nation's solar power. The eclipse presents an unusual challenge for those who manage the state's power grid because the solar energy will drop off and re-emerge more quickly than during usual conditions involving clouds or nightfall.

Grid managers say they've been preparing extensively for more than a year and are confident nobody will lose power. They'll ramp up other sources of power, mainly hydroelectric and natural gas."

"NABH: Medical association wants NABH accreditation for government hospitals, Health News, ET HealthWorld","AURANGABAD: In the wake of Gorakhpur tragedy where around 30 children died at a state-run hospital in a day, the Indian Medical Association ( IMA ) has recommended National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Provider ( NABH ) accreditation for government hospitals across the country on the lines of private hospital.Highlighting that the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority ( IRDA ) has made it mandatory for all private hospitals to get certification from the NABH, the IMA has pressed that the same should be extended to all government hospitals as well.A constituent board of Quality Council of India — set up to establish and operate accreditation programme for healthcare organisations — the NABH is also an institutional member as well as a board member of the International Society for Quality in Health Care (lSQua).IMA national president K K Aggarwal could not be reached for comments. Jayesh Lele, immediate past president of IMA, Maharashtra, said the government hospitals should go for at least the entry-level accreditation.“The NABH has three-layer certification process, of which entry-level certification was introduced around a year ago to ensure small and medium-sized hospitals follow a set of minimum required norms for offering effective health care services. The government should prevail upon state-run health facilities to opt for this basic certification to avoid serious incidents like one reported in Gorakhpur,” he said.Stressing that proper documentation was one of the thrust areas of the NABH evaluation, Lele said it could in turn automatically take care of key aspects of functioning of health establishment, including maintaining adequate drug inventory.The IMA, according to authorities, have encouraged around 700 private hospitals to go for entry-level certification of the NABH.Jagdish Prasad, director general of health services with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, was not available for comments. An official mail sent to his office seeking views on IMA recommendations remained unanswered till late Friday evening.Among other recommendations, the IMA has also stressed that all hospitals should have a backup of one-week supply of all essential drugs and oxygen and all payments for healthcare services should be made either in advance or in time.“All patients denied treatment at government hospitals should be reimbursed for the cost of treatment in the private sector at pre-defined rates. Also, essential drugs and investigations, non-essential drugs and tests, should constitute the bulk of the expenditure of the allocated budget to reduce the cost of treatment,” the IMA has suggested.At least 30 children died in a span 48 hours at Baba Raghav Das Medical College's Nehru Hospital on August 10 and 11. The oxygen supply remained disrupted on August 10 evening though the state government has said this was not the reason for the deaths. A committee has been formed to ascertain the cause of deaths."

Does Our Faith Define Us? This Incredible Video About A Temple Will Make You Think Otherwise,"PARTNER

Can faith move mountains? It sure can, if only, you believe in the right thing. Faith is generally defined by the caste or religion that we belong to, but faith is not just about being a Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Sikh. Faith is believing in each other, it is believing in something that gives you hope and brings you happiness. Faith is about being united even when our so called caste and religion tries to divide us.

This incredible video by United Colors of Benetton, is based on a true story. It is based on the life of a man in Lucknow who gave a part of his house to make a temple. Every day he visits the temple with milk and garlands, not because his faith demands so, but because seeing people still holding on to their hopes and dreams gives him happiness. What is his caste you may ask? Pat comes the reply, he is an Indian. For him, the happiness of the people around him is more important than the caste he belongs to. Known for their strong stand to unite one and all, United Colors of Benetton strongly believe in the ideology of unity. In this video, they bring alive the incredible story of this man in Lucknow and exemplifies how we all can be #UnitedByFaith."

15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."
"India to seek investments for oil and gas auctions at mega hydrocarbon event in UK, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","New Delhi: The government will seek global investor participation for its ongoing mega oil and gas auction during the international Society of Petroleum Engineers ( SPE ) Offshore Europe conference to take place in Aberdeen, UK next month.The four day-conference that will begin on 5 September will include technical sessions, conferences, workshops, exhibitions from industry players across the value chain of the oil and gas sector and include a special event by the Indian government on Open Acreage Licensing Programme ( OALP ), National Data Repository (NDR) and the latest investment opportunities in the Indian oil and gas sector.“In order to showcase investment opportunities in upstream Oil & Gas sector in India and recent policy reforms – OALP, Hydrocarbon Exploration & Licensing Policy ( HELP ) and National Data Repository, the government is organising an event at SPE Offshore Europe-2017 at Aberdeen,” upstream regulator Directorate General of Hydrocarbons ( DGH ) said in a notice today.The SPE Offshore Europe Conference is expected to witness participation from oil and gas giants including Schlumberger Limited, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Wood Group, Petrobas, GE and leading E&P professionals from across the world.Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan had called upon the global investor community to participate in India's current oil and gas bidding round at the World Petroleum Congress (WPC) held in Istanbul, Turkey last month.

Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here’s How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let’s learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let’s say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here’s how you can too:

The I-Can’t-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

Click selfies with a lot of people around. They make you feel happier and prettier.

Twitter

Somehow group selfies are awesome, especially when it’s with people who love you to the core. There are a whole bunch of smiles, and when you are all dressed in your best, it’s got to be awesome. Deepika swears by this too, since most of the times she clicks group selfies with her adoring fans.

Portray You as You!

Let your all-purpose phone speak out your personality and define you as a person.

OPPO F3

Afterall, this gadget is literally close to your heart at all times. From the external design to the internal configuration, it’s got to describe you in a second to an unknown person passing by. Whether you are an hard-core techie or a fashionista like Deepika, your phone should be able to portray you in the right light.

Customize it to speak out your mind.

OPPO F3

Since outward appearances speak out louder, customize the exterior according to what’s on your mind. Bedazzle it, hard-case it or if you don’t vouch for it, you can customize the interior too! Deepika has customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as #F3DeepikaEdition.

She has designed her own icon with OPPO, that’s etched on the back of the phone. The icon has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded on it. Sweet isn’t? The unique Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie. A 16-megapixel selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

Fashionistas and DP fans, want to watch the lovely Deepika talking about her #F3DeepikaEdition? Watch this video right here and book one already!"
Government must develop its ‘human capital’ akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

Bangladesh cricket is not all about Mominul: Hathurusinghe,"AUSTRALIA TOUR OF BANGLADESH, 2017

Bangladesh cricket is not all about Mominul: Hathurusinghe

• Last updated on Sat, 19 Aug, 2017, 07:46 PM Atif Azam in Dhaka

Bangladesh head coach Chandika Hathurusinghe believes fairness was maintained during the selection of the 14-member squad for the opening game of the upcoming two-match Test series against Australia.

The omission of Mominul Haque from the opening game, first time since his debut when he was left out of the squad, looked to be the biggest talking point in the heated presser at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday (August 19). Although chief selector Minhajul Abedin tackled most of the bouncers bowled at the panel comprising of the selectors with Hathurusinghe and Habibul Bashar, the Sri Lankan did not got away unscratched.

When asked what responsibility he held as a coach for not being able to turn things around for Mominul, who appeared to be the best batsman in the longer-version, his eyes blinked in sheer disbelief. Hathurusinghe, who happens to hold a very special power in country's cricket periphery, thanks to his success, did manage to come up with a solid defence.

""As a coach, you have a responsibility,"" Hathurusinghe said. ""But the player also knows what he has to do. They are working very hard on it.

""Somebody is going to go out of the team when they are not performing. Those players not in the squad, they are still practicing. Confidence comes when we communicate with the player. There is no rule but fairness is applied for everybody,"" he said pointing out that everyone was picked factoring in their form, adding that consistency was maintained in the selection process being part of the selection committee.

""Bangladesh cricket is not all about Mominul,"" he said. ""Selection is done by consistency. Some of the guys were dropped for our last Test. I won't mention name because the team is more important.

""Consistent selection gives a lot of confidence to players who perform. We have reason to make good calls because we have been consistent on selection,"" he added.

Regarding the omission of Mahmudullah, Hathurusinghe said that he did not have much of a choice after the replacement did his job quite well in the last Test against Sri Lanka. ""The guys who played in the last game after losing the first Test came back and did well. Although the other guys are doing well in limited-overs cricket, unfortunately they have to wait for their time,"" he said. ""Good thing is we are in a rich vein of form in the last few series. Players who got dropped have to wait.

""Everyone is aware of where they stand: why they are in the team or dropped. They are working hard on what they have to do,"" he concluded.

"Blood cancer: Vitamin C may help genes to kill blood cancer stem cells, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Representational image

Washington D.C. : A study has recently revealed that vitamin C may tell faulty stem cells in the bone marrow to mature and die normally, instead of multiplying to cause blood cancers.

According to researchers, certain genetic changes are known to reduce the ability of an enzyme called TET2 to encourage stem cells to become mature blood cells, which eventually die, in many patients with certain kinds of leukemia.

The new study found that vitamin C activated TET2 function in mice engineered to be deficient in the enzyme.

Corresponding study author Benjamin G. Neel said, ""We're excited by the prospect that high-dose vitamin C might become a safe treatment for blood diseases caused by TET2-deficient leukemia stem cells, most likely in combination with other targeted therapies.""

The results suggested that changes in the genetic code (mutations) that reduce TET2 function are found in 10 percent of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 30 percent of those with a form of pre-leukemia called myelodysplastic syndrome, and in nearly 50 percent of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

The study results revolve around the relationship between TET2 and cytosine, one of the four nucleic acid ""letters"" that comprise the DNA code in genes.

To determine the effect of mutations that reduce TET2 function in abnormal stem cells, the team genetically engineered mice such that the scientists could switch the TET2 gene on or off.

The findings indicated that vitamin C did the same thing as restoring TET2 function genetically. By promoting DNA demethylation, high-dose vitamin C treatment induced stem cells to mature, and also suppressed the growth of leukemia cancer stem cells from human patients implanted in mice.

""Interestingly, we also found that vitamin C treatment had an effect on leukemic stem cells that resembled damage to their DNA,"" said first study author Luisa Cimmino.

""For this reason, we decided to combine vitamin C with a PARP inhibitor, a drug type known to cause cancer cell death by blocking the repair of DNA damage, and already approved for treating certain patients with ovarian cancer,"" Cimmino added.

The findings appear in journal Cell."
"Hadiya gets a raw deal, but it is not too late to make amends","Most of us have grown up with the belief that an adult wishing to marry or embrace religion can approach the courts to surmount roadblocks placed by family and society. Perhaps, it is time to let go of the notion. The Kerala High Court and Supreme Court have implicitly introduced a new element besides informed consent and free will: the role of socio-political groups in helping such individuals convert or marry. The Supreme Court’s order directing the National Investigation Agency to probe the conversion of Hadiya, previously Akhila Asokan, and her subsequent marriage to Shefin Jahan, after the Centre told the court that a “pattern” (based on just two other cases) seems to exist, gives grist to the “love jihad” rumours about certain radical Muslim outfits having a vested interest in such conversions. I am not opposed to a probe on the so-called “love jihad” but that can be taken up separately. It is important to conclusively get to the bottom of “love jihad” so that the State can answer authoritatively to those fomenting communal tensions, whether they are aligned with extremist Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Sikh groups.

My disillusionment is with the attempt to deny an adult citizen her right to choose her faith and partner simply because some organisations and individuals with allegedly radical views are providing support to her. It has the effect of choking individual freedoms that essentially lie in the private sphere that no State must intrude into. Non-governmental organisations exist the world over to support individuals and society. Here, the organisations that are under the scanner are not brainwashing an individual to become a terrorist. What could be more peaceful than becoming religious and deciding to marry? But it is important to put this case in its correct socio-political context. One, we are living in a time when Muslim groups and conservative Muslims are insecure and are looked upon with suspicion. Two, recall that 22 Malayalis, some of them Hindu and Christian converts to Islam, took refuge with the ISIS in Afghanistan.

Take note of this paragraph from the May 2017 judgment of a division bench of the Kerala High Court that annulled Shefin’s marriage to Hadiya, sent her to live with her parents, and ordered the Kerala Police DGP to conduct a probe into the organisations that have supported Hadiya. “Her conduct cannot be accepted as that of a person who is possessed of her faculties. She has no idea as to what she wants in life. She appears to be under the control of someone else. It is evident that she has been indoctrinated and influenced by persons whose identities have not been ascertained.” The conduct referred to is Hadiya’s decision to marry Shefin instead of proceeding to undertake her house surgeoncy to complete her Bachelors in Homeopathy course.

However, what may have disrupted Hadiya’s education is the legal battle over her custody that is being fought by her parents since January 2016. Another bench of the high court had rejected a previous habeas corpus petition moved by Hadiya’s father in January 2016 and found that she was under no coercion. Even if Hadiya has been “indoctrinated and influenced” it is not in the pursuit of anything illegal. But then the court notes that its interaction with Hadiya gave the judges the “impression that, she is only an ordinary girl of moderate intellectual capacity.” The court also felt that Hadiya did not appear to be “capable of taking a firm and independent decision on her own”.

It must be remembered that Hadiya is a person who finished 13 years of schooling and was on the verge of completing a bachelor’s course in a country where just 3% women are graduates. The judgment records that Hadiya chose to leave her hostel because of poor quality food and chose to live in rented accommodation with four other students in Salem, Tamil Nadu, far from her native home in Vaikom, Kerala. None of these appears to be the hallmark of a girl without intellectual capacity or ability to take firm and independent decisions. It is plausible that her marriage in between the legal proceedings without intimating the court was a calculated defiance of the court by Hadiya and those backing her for entertaining the second habeas corpus petition after another court had rejected the first petition. If a single woman’s desire to go her own way was finding no acceptance, it is hardly a surprise that the patriarchal organisations purportedly backing her suggested the option of marriage and becoming a wife to win “social respect” and end the repeated intrusion.

There are technical grounds, of course, to annul the marriage. Her name is misspelt in the marriage registration documents thereby endangering her ability to claim alimony in case the marriage sours. But the judges had other problems too with the marriage. “It is clear that Shafin Jahan is only a stooge who has been assigned to play the role of going through a marriage ceremony. The alleged marriage is only a sham and is of no consequence. The same was intended only to force the hands of this court and to scuttle the proceedings in this case that were progressing. The same was intended only to take Ms.Akhila out of reach of this Court and her parents.” The inference that external elements are scripting the drama is hard to miss. Elsewhere, the court notes that though Hadiya and her benefactor, a woman named Sainaba, have limited sources of income a senior advocate of the Kerala high court, S Sreekumar was representing her in the case. The court wondered where they found the means to hire such an expensive lawyer. If Muslim community groups wish to hire the best legal help to fight what they see as a prestige battle or a fight over constitutional rights, I wouldn’t be surprised. I would assume that the RSS and the Catholic Church would similarly defend converts to the Hindu or Catholic fold.

The court also makes this observation about Hadiya’s decision to follow Islam. “In the first place, it is not normal for a young girl in her early 20s, pursuing a professional course, to abandon her studies and to set out in pursuit of learning an alien faith and religion. The normal youth is indifferent towards religion and religious studies. Though the possibility of genuine interest in the study of religion on the part of any person cannot be ruled out, such inclination is in the first place out of the ordinary. Though the alleged detenue in this case is stated to have set out to study Islam, her study has been confined to merely attending a course of two months duration conducted by the 6th respondent. She does not appear to have conducted any study thereafter.”

What qualifies judges to make such profound observations about human behaviour? Should young women abandon studies only to marry or elope with their lovers? Are religious pursuits beyond their abilities? Is a professional course everything in life? How does the court decide that normal youth are indifferent to religion and religious studies? Why should everyone be reduced to the normative? Where does it say that adopting religion requires extensive study?

When the judgment is done with questioning Hadiya’s behaviour, it turns its attention to Shefin and his criminal antecedents. It notes that Shefin is an accused in a 2013 case involving charges of Sections 143, 147, 341, 323, 294(b) read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code. It is a case of unlawful assembly and some related charges. Shefin is a member of the SDPI, a political party which fights elections, but which has been accused of following a radical Islamist agenda and whose members have been accused of conducting weapon training camps. While the rest of us may be dismayed at the existence of such parties, the fact is that radical right-wing groups hold sway among both Muslims and Hindus. For groups like SDPI their existence is a double-edged sword: if they stay out of electoral politics they are seen as subversive, but if they join the mainstream, they are seen merely as front organisations offering a political cover.

Not surprisingly, the court cites a single judge bench order of 2009 in a bail matter which called into question the alleged “functioning of radical organizations pursuing activities of converting young girls of Hindu religion to Islam on the pretext of love”. Interpreting this as a fact the court says: “The fact remains that such activities are going on around us in our society. Therefore, it is only appropriate that the petitioner and his wife, who are the parents, are given custody of Ms.Akhila.” Returning to Shefin, if a criminal case of unlawful assembly against a political activist would be a disqualification for marriage, 95% of Kerala’s politicians would remain bachelors.

I am a firm believer in the idea that an adult must take responsibility for his or her decisions and their outcome. Here, Hadiya, all of 24 years, and on the verge of completing her bachelors in homoeopathy has repeatedly and fervently stated that she embraced Islam with her free will and after imbibing sufficient knowledge. She has also asserted her desire to live with Shefin. But this is what Justices K Surendra Mohan and Abraham Mathew of Kerala high court writes: “A girl aged 24 years is weak and vulnerable, capable of being exploited in many ways. This Court exercising parens patriae jurisdiction is concerned with the welfare of a girl of her age.” The court’s “concern” should have ended when Hadiya spoke her mind, but the decision to annul her marriage and send her to live with her parents is not parens patriae (“parent of the nation”). Rather, it becomes an intrusion into a citizen’s private life. At 24, if a “girl” (not a woman yet?) is weak and vulnerable, I wonder when a woman can be strong and indestructible. Perhaps, in her ripe old age.

Despite all this talk about faith, the judgment clarifies that “it is not our concern or attempt to decide whether Ms.Akhila should follow Islamic faith or the Hindu faith”. The judgment adds: “The question of faith and religion are matters of personal conviction and this court does not consider it necessary to interfere in such matters that are personal to Ms. Akhila. However, what concerns this Court is the decision of hers that, she does not want to live with her parents.” Elsewhere the court notes the anguish of her parents. “There are no other persons in this world, who would consider the welfare and well-being of their daughter to be of paramount importance than her parents. Nature provides numerous examples of even animals taking care of and protecting their progeny sacrificing their very lives for the purpose. The Homo Sapien is no exception. The forces operating from behind the curtains have succeeded in creating a hostility in the mind of Ms.Akhila towards her parents.”

The court has cited one legal precedent that recognised parental authority over even a female who has attained majority. But there would be hundreds of other judgments rejecting parental authority over majors. When the court says that “marriage being the most important decision in her life, can also be taken only with the active involvement of her parents” it does great disservice to generations of women who have fought hard to reclaim their agency and autonomy. Hadiya’s fight opens these closed chapters again but she must now deal with new challenges like “national interest” while becoming another pawn in the ongoing “war against terror”.

If I were a judge I would leave these beautiful lines from Kahlil Gibran’s Prophet in the poem “On Children” for Hadiya’s parents.

Your children are not your children.

They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.

They come through you but not from you,

And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts,

For they have their own thoughts.

You may house their bodies but not their souls,

For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,

which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.

You may strive to be like them,

but seek not to make them like you.

For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

In the end, let us face some hard facts about Indian families. Religious conversion and inter-caste and inter-religion marriage are stigmatised and often meet violent ends. The court may believe that it has done its paternalistic duty to “ensure the safety of at least the girls who are brought before it can be discharged only by ensuring that Ms.Akhila is in safe hands”. But the high court and the Supreme Court’s rejection of Hadiya’s testimony because of the lurking fear that it is a case of illegal conversion and love jihad disrupts cherished constitutional and human ideals like adult franchise, right to marry, and the right to adopt any religion of one’s choice. Hadiya and Shefin can claim to have got a raw deal from the courts. But it is not too late. Allow Hadiya the freedom to make her choices. Let us, as society, as courts, as police, as individual citizens, watch her and every citizen, not to judge them or intrude into their privacy, but to ensure their safety and security in a society that is turning increasingly insular and suspicious of the other."
"petrol pumps: Petrol pump racket: Accused visited 25 nations to study tricks to rig machines, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","Mumbai: The man at the centre of the investigations into tampering of fuel dispensers made several trips aboard to study technology and methods for rigging machines at petrol pumps , cops have learned.Prakash Nulkar, 56, who previously worked at a manufacturer of fuel dispensers, visited 25 countries, including China, Japan, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa between 1998 and 2017. He finally decided to import components such as microchips from China and altered them to suit local specifications, said an officer with the Thane Crime Branch The chips were inserted into fuel dispensing units, which then pumped less fuel than what customers paid for. The method helped dishonest petrol station owners skim hundreds of litres of fuel every day.“Nulkar was the biggest supplier of tampered machines and parts to petrol stations across the country. He revealed many details during interrogation,” said the officer, who has been part of the probe from the start.On June 16, the Thane Crime Branch inspected a petrol station in Manpada and found that its dispensing units had been altered to secretly pump less fuel. Several petrol stations were subsequently raided in Mumbai, Thane district and other parts of the state and more instances of cheating came to light.Nulkar was arrested from Hubli Karnataka , on July 11. He apparently wanted to set up an operations control centre in China. Investigators are reviewing his international transactions and trying to identify suspects located outside India.One of his main associates in the country was Vivek Shetye, a 47-yearold software engineer from Dombivali. He was arrested earlier. The Crime Branch officer said multiple teams tracked Nulkar’s movements for close to a month before finally nabbing him.In all, he made 40 trips abroad. Singapore, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Madagascar, Bahrain, Myanmar, Malaysia are among the countries he visited. “Nulkar conducted a detailed study before starting the racket. All his foreign trips and the people he met there are under scrutiny. This could be just the tip of the iceberg,” said deputy police commissioner (crime) Abhishek Trimukhe.So far, evidence of tampering has been found at 125 petrol pumps across the state."

"Gorakhpur deaths: Gorakhpur tragedy: IMA gives clean chit to doctors over allegations of medical negligence, Health News, ET HealthWorld","AGRA: A fact finding committee of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to assess the reasons for the Gorakhpur hospital tragedy has given a clean chit to Dr Rajiv Mishra and Dr Kafeel Khan , as far as medical negligence is concerned but hasn't ruled out administrative lapses on their part.The committee has recommended that administrative inquiry and action could be initiated against the two doctors. The inquiry has also revealed that oxygen supply was interrupted for a short time on the night of August 10, as the supplier had failed to replenish stocks due to non-payment of his dues for the last 5-6 months. The report also reveals that the hospital was handling cases of patients needing oxygen supply more than its capacity.Talking to TOI, President of IMA, Dr KK Agarwal said that the report had been sent, along with recommendations to the UP government .He said that according to the fact finding report no evidence of medical negligence found against the then principal Dr RK Mishra and head of children’s encephalitis ward at the hospital, Dr Kafeel Khan, who was sacked by the government on Sunday.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) appointed a team of three members to inquire into the death of nearly 70 children at a hospital in Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur city. The report states that no alert was issued by the hospital administration regarding shortage of oxygen and treating doctors should have been alerted in advance about the shortage.The report also states that cleanliness of hospital and the wards was unsatisfactory, besides presence of dogs and rats in the premises. The report states that such standards are not acceptable.The report also points out that there are no facilities in Gorakhpur and nearby districts to manage encephalitis and ICUs in 10 districts of Purvanchal area are not functioning due to lack of staff and other resources.At least 30 children died in 48 hours at BRD Medical College on August 10 and 11. Many of the deaths were alleged to have been caused because of shortage of oxygen, a claim dismissed by the Uttar Pradesh government.IMA has suggested certain measures to avoid similar situation in the future. These include a state policy to airlift such critically ill patients in a timely manner to nearby best facilities, all payments for health care services of such cases should be made either in advance or in time, hospitals should have backup of one week supply of all essential drugs and oxygen.Also, patients who are denied treatment at government hospitals should be reimbursed for the cost of treatment in the private sector at predefined rates, need to make distinction between clinical medical and administrative negligence."
"Being in a Sports Club is Good for the Soul, Health News, ET HealthWorld","Vienna/Alpbach, 16 August 2017 : While so-called social networks are booming and Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp have millions of users in Austria, ""real"" social contacts are perceptibly declining. Together with the Austrian Federal Sports Organisation (BSO), scientists from MedUni Vienna's Division of Environmental Hygiene and Environmental Medicine headed up by Hans-Peter Hutter have now investigated the effect that being an active member of a sports club has on our health. Apart from the beneficial effect of regular exercise, the main finding of the meta-study is: active membership has a positive effect upon mental health . Hans-Peter Hutter will present the study this coming Tuesday (22 August, 16-17:30 hrs, Flora Hall) as part of a partner session at the European Forum Alpbach under the title ""The sports club as a health driver "".The main health impacts from the 1,685 reviewed papers on the subject of ""Sports Clubs and Health"" are as follows:* Being an active member of a sports club during adolescence helps to integrate a person into society ""and helps to stop young people from going down the wrong path,"" says Hutter.* Active membership of a sports club increases a young person’s self-confidence – ""especially in the case of girls"".* Active membership of a sports club has a beneficial effect upon well-being and mental health (e.g. vitality). Says Hutter: ""These effects are much greater than those resulting from individually organised sporting activities.""* Members of sports clubs are generally (more) content with their lives.* Being an active member of a sports club is fun and also provides socialisation. This in turn leads to more regular sporting activities.The beneficial health impacts of the social aspect of sports clubs were observed in all age groups and in both genders.According to the authors (Hans-Peter Hutter and Peter Wallner from MedUni Vienna, Anna Wanka from Vienna University; Christian Gormász, Anna-Maria Wiesner and Rainer Rößlhuber from BSO), medicine often underestimates social aspects and rarely mentions their positive impact upon health – and this equally applies to sport.Finally, recent studies have also indicated that an active social life is beneficial in the prevention of dementia. Says Hutter: ""Social contacts keep you vital, because you have to respond to your opposite number. This improves your cognitive abilities. Playing sport in a club has general psychosocial benefits – that is also a unique feature of a group activity.""Being in a Sports Club is Good for the Soul"

"Tracking and treating Hepatitis B and C, Health News, ET HealthWorld","About one million Indians are at risk of acquiring HBV infection and about 10,000 die from the virus every year.

ByDevare,Director of Diagnostics Research, Abbott, IllinoisThere’s a war of epic proportions going on right now between the human immune system and a plethora of infectious diseases such as HIV, Dengue, Chikungunya, Swine Flu, Malaria, Tuberculosis (TB), and Hepatitis . Are we losing this battle? We could if we don’t keep up with these viruses as they tend to mutate rapidly, outpacing diagnostics. The ways to address these evolving challenges are to continue to strengthen our virus surveillance efforts and develop tests to track and detect these viruses.Hepatitis is caused by aggressive viruses that have resulted in worldwide epidemics. In 2015, deaths due to viral hepatitis were higher than those due to HIV, TB and Malaria. Hepatitis is a disease characterized by inflammation of the liver. Over time, this inflammation in the liver results in scarring, chronic liver damage (also called cirrhosis) and even liver cancer. At the point of cirrhosis, the liver is unable to heal itself.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in India, 40 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 6 to 12 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). In addition to HBV and HCV, there are three other hepatitis viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis D virus (HDV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV). HBV, HCV and HDV are transmitted through exposure to infected bodily fluids including shared toothbrushes and razors; shared drug needles, sexual transmission, unscreened blood transfusions and non-sterilized medical equipment. HAV and HEV are transmitted by ingesting contaminated food or water. Most acute liver failures diagnosed in India are due to hepatitis E infection. Children are most susceptible to hepatitis A as it’s associated with poor sanitation and hygiene. Unlike HBV and HCV, HAV infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but in rare situations, it can cause debilitating symptoms and acute liver failure. Globally, HBV and HCV are given priority as they are a leading cause of death .India is one of the 11 countries which carry almost 50 percent of the global burden of chronic hepatitis. While HBV and HCV cause chronic infections, HAV and HEV are not chronic. HAV and HEV could be effectively dealt with by public education, improving sanitation and hygiene. To eliminate hepatitis in India, it is important to screen and diagnose those infected with the virus. About one million Indians are at risk of acquiring HBV infection and about 10,000 die from the virus every year. Anti-viral drugs for treatment of HBV infected people are helpful to help suppress the disease, but because the treatment does not cure HBV infection, most people who start treatment must continue it for life. Vaccination at birth is the most effective avenue for protection from HBV infection. For HCV elimination, it is important to use diagnostic tests to identify people with active infection and treat them with anti-viral drugs now available in India. A 12 to 24 weeks anti-HCV treatment leads to cure in over 95% of infected people.To align with the WHO’s 2030 goal of hepatitis elimination, many countries, including India, have embarked on national plans investing in screenings for earlier detection and paving the way for people to have access treatment. Recently on World Hepatitis Day, India’s Union Minister of Health – Dr JP Nadda announced the National Action Plan for Hepatitis C, which will be completed by December 2017 and rolled out subsequently next year. Funded fully by the government, the plan will focus on three key aspects – prevention, screening and surveillance.While with the collective push from the WHO and local health authorities, and the awareness about treatment has increased, the incidence continues to rise. As per the WHO, in 2015, 1.75 million adults were newly infected with HCV largely due to injection drug use and due to unsafe injections in health care settings in some countries. Therefore, in addition to monitoring incidence of viral outbreaks, India’s focus should be on populations with high-risk of viral infections – such as patients who receive multiple blood transfusions because they have inherited blood disorders, such as thalassemia (abnormal haemoglobin production) and sickle cell anaemia (a group of disorders caused by deformed red blood cells to break down); haemodialysis patients (whose kidneys do not work normally and depend on a dialysis process for purifying the blood), intravenous drug users, prison inmates, and emergency unit patients.The weakest link in gauging the ongoing impact of the hepatitis virus is the availability of incidence data. India should build a national hepatitis surveillance hub that tracks the strains over the years across various communities. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a strategy to screen all people born between years 1945 to 1965 for HCV as this population accounted for 73 per cent of all HCV-associated deaths. A similar approach could be implemented to identify population groups greatly impacted by hepatitis viruses in India. Since most people living with hepatitis are not aware of the infection, public education, screening, diagnosis and treatment are the critical steps in eliminating hepatitis. The WHO goal to eliminate hepatitis by 2030 is ambitious, and its success will depend of the global effort from high-burden countries.Diagnosis is the first step for identifying the presence of an infection. HIV and hepatitis viruses evolve to produce diverse strains. Increasing diversity and the ever-changing distribution of these viruses continue to present a challenge to diagnostic and monitoring tests. The way to ensure that diagnostic tools keep pace with these viruses is to remain committed to ongoing research. It is of utmost importance to monitor viral evolution and track new strains around the world by establishing global surveillance programs and warrant that all viral infections are efficiently detected by diagnostic tests despite of wide genetic diversity.The WHO estimates that 257 million people were living with HBV and 71 million living with HCV infections in 2015. The majority of these people were not diagnosed, and only less than one tenth of the HBV and HCV infected people who were diagnosed were on treatment in 2015. What’s unique about HCV is that it operates on the sly, 80 percent of people with an acute HCV infection show no apparent symptoms, with many people progressing to chronic infection. Because so many are not aware of an HCV infection, the condition may go unnoticed for decades, often until permanent damage has been done to the liver. So, how can you detect a virus that rarely, outwardly shows its face? First, understanding the genetic diversity of the virus is a key factor to building the right strategy.With advances in testing and treatments, it is possible to eliminate hepatitis C with patient proactivity - if you have not been tested for HCV, please talk to your doctor about getting tested so you know your status. Anti-viral treatment is available to eliminate HCV and get cured from the viral infection."

"Government seeks caps on drug trade margins, Health News, ET HealthWorld","NEW DELHI: The government plans to cap trade margins to make drugs cheaper, replace brand names with salt names for generic drugs , clamp down on unfair marketing practices and boost local manufacturing to reduce dependence on imports, according to government's draft national pharmaceutical policy.The draft, prepared by the pharmaceuticals department, also suggests restructuring of the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority to strengthen the price regulatory mechanism.It highlights the high trade margins and bonus offers by stockists, distributors and retailers, which hit the industry and consumers.The draft policy said, ""After detailed stakeholder consultations, the level of trade margins will be prescribed to create a level playing field for the Industry and to bring down prices.""""Institutions receiving supplies directly from manufacturers/distributors or retailers will also be covered under the trade margin reforms,"" it said.In its effort to promote generic medicines, the draft proposes that public procurement and dispensing of medicines to be of generic drugs in salt names. ""Giving brand names to generic drugs hampers real innovation and shall be discouraged... To facilitate this, the government will pursue the policy of sale of single ingredient drugs by their pharmacopeial name/salt name. To keep the identity of the manufacturer, the manufacturer would be allowed to stamp its name on the drug package. For patented drugs and Fixed Dose Combination (FDCs) drugs, brand names may be used. However here, the principle of 'one company-one drug-one brand name-one price' would be implemented,"" it said.It also proposes e-prescription to aid and assist the registered medical practitioners in prescribing medicines in the generic names. E-prescriptions will be put into operation whereby the prescriptions will be computerised and the medicine name will be picked up from a drop down menu of salt names.Once implemented, the proposed policy is expected to address the current challenges of the pharmaceutical industry and make essential medicines more affordable. It is also likely to give more powers to the government on deciding price of medicines over the pricing regulator NPPA As per the draft policy, the government will decide on the drugs to be subjected under price control, while NPPA will be responsible for laying down the price ceilings of selected medicines, enforcement of those price ceilings and ensuring that medicines are available in the market in adequate quantities.Prices once fixed by the NPPA shall not be revised by the regulator unless directed specifically by the government or a higher court to do so, according to the draft.Strengthening the regulatory mechanism, it suggests NPPA be assisted by an advisory body for pricing, nominated by the government. ""The body will consist of doctors, pharmacists, other experts, civil society representatives, industry representatives and government representatives. The advice of this body will be recommendatory and the NPPA may accept or modify the advice rendered. While modifying/rejecting its advice, the NPPA will assign reasons in writing for doing so,"" the draft said.""The regulator and the government would be two distinct agencies. The government shall not be the regulator and the regulator shall not be the government,"" the draft policy said.The draft policy also laid down several other policy prescriptions that include enhancing quality standards, reining in unfair trade practices, faster approvals, boosting indigenous manufacturing and encouraging research and development.The department has sought comments from the industry on the draft, after which it will be tabled before the Cabinet."

"Piyush Goyal: Centre rejigs PPA, takes the wind out of state power discom bullies, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld","NEW DELHI: The Centre has taken a stern view of state distribution companies violating contracts by bullying solar and wind power developers to cut prices, which bankers say will discourage lenders and investors.The minister for power, coal, renewable energy and mines, Piyush Goyal , has expressed concern at the development and has opposed violation of contracts that have already been signed. Goyal is spearheading India’s massive expansion of renewable energy capacity, which has made India a world leader in growth of wind and solar generation.“The government view is very clear that the legal framework has to be respected.All PPAs, whatever the legal terms are, they will be respected. But if a PPA has a mutual negotiation clause, and somebody is willing to do it, then what can be done?” he told ET.Fierce competition in solar and wind power auctions along with falling prices of equipment have helped tariffs tumble to record lows, making older projects look very costly. This has prompted many state discoms to ask project developers to sell electricity at the lowest available rate even if the contract for a particular plant was signed when costs were much higher.A government official said the Centre was considering sending an advisory to states, cautioning them about the adverse implications of their efforts to arm-twist companies to cut rates. The Indian Banks Association has also written to the power and finance ministries saying that the action by states was threatening the viability of projects, which in turn would make their loans risky.States where project developers are being pressured to cut tariffs include Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, UP and Jharkhand. Government officials said that renewable energy projects are a key part of India’s efforts to meet its climate commitments and to reduce the use of polluting fossil fuels, and the effort to promote clean energy has the strong backing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At a recent meeting with the wind developers and state nodal agencies for renewable energy, newly appointed secretary of the renewable energy ministry, Anand Kumar, expressed great surprise at the deluge of complaints from developers. Most of them related to state discoms trying to go back on their commitments on wind energy.He promised to do something about the matter and also told them to keep filing petitions before the appropriate forums. Subsequently, there has been a meeting of state regulators with MNRE officials at which issues raised by developers were discussed with them. Thereafter MNRE has also been in touch with the power secretaries of different states pointing out the problems that have arisen and urging them to get their discoms to behave and honour commitments.Kumar also wants power purchase agreements to be honoured unless there is an issue of irregularity or corruption."
No More Complicated Guesswork: This App Can Definitely Tell If Your Partner Is Cheating On You!,"In the times when everything is digital, even finding a date can be just as easy as finding a recipe of your favourite dish.

Look at apps like Tinder, for example, which let you can swipe through potential conquests to your heart's content and your partner will never know.

But if you've been using Tinder whilst in a relationship, whether to physically cheat on your partner or just have a few swipes to see if you've still got what it takes to play the game, you could be in trouble.

According to The Independent, a new app named Swipebuster allows you to search for someone on Tinder and see when they last swiped. One can possibly tell their partner that they just did not deleted their profile, but this app takes care of that too.

This app will also show when someone was last active on the dating app.

Swipebuster costs about Rs 500 for three searches and all you have to do is put in the first name, age and likely location of your suspect. The app insists that it only presents information that is public on Tinder.

No more cheating and getting away with it, folks. Beware! So best not to even think about it, no matter how smart you think you are."
"At last, India gets genuinely serious about companies flouting mining and environment laws","By Himangshu Watts

The landmark judgement of the Supreme Court imposing penalties of an estimated Rs 25,000 crore on illegal mining merits serious reading by the entire corporate sector, and not just by those who extract mineral wealth.

Two aspects of the verdict stand out. First, the verdict takes environmental law enforcement by the Centre and the highest judicial authority to anew high, which is a very strong deterrent against such practices in the future. This strong message will protect the environment and clean up the poisonous air in cities more effectively than some outrageous, controversial and ill-conceived steps taken by various authorities in recent years.

Second, the court has ordered heavy expenditure for the welfare of tribal people in affected areas. This reinforces the GoI’s declared strategy of targeting and extracting ill-gotten wealth to help the poor, whether by demonetisation of high-value currency notes, or with the goods and services tax (GST).

A crucial aspect of the court case that needs to be highlighted is the fact that the mines ministry, after Piyush Goyal took charge of its affairs, dramatically changed the relatively lenient position that the previous government had taken in the matter of companies violating green laws applicable to the sector. In doing this, GoI showed its determination to resist strong pressures.

Conventionally, mining was deemed illegal only if ores were extracted without a mining lease. Under the mining law, the penalty was equal to the entire output from such an operation. However, once the lease was obtained, even if the mining operation ravaged forests, made the air unbreathable and degraded the environment to make thousands of crores, the penalty under the environment law was a laughable Rs 50,000. This built a very strong business case to start mining without waiting for green clearances.

The government argued before the Supreme Court in January that extracting minerals without the necessary green clearance should be deemed illegal not just under the environmental law but also under the mining law that imposes back-breaking penalties for default. The Supreme Court has upheld this view.

It’s Mine, Not Yours

This means that even if you have a mining lease, any extraction without forest and environment clearance is illegal and the state must recover the value of the entire output from the defaulter.

Further, the court has ordered that the hefty penalty must be used very transparently for the development of tribal areas where the mines are located. It has ordered that the “very large amounts” that will flow to Odisha after the verdict must be kept in a special purpose vehicle (SPV). To ensure that the funds are used for the benefits of tribal people in affected areas, it has asked the state’s chief secretary to file an affidavit stating the work done and audited accounts of the SPV.

For those who think they can make millions without caring for the environment, the court did not mince words. It delivered the message in the first paragraph of the judgement, “Lessees… in Odisha have rapaciously mined iron ore and manganese ore, apparently destroyed the environment and forests and perhaps caused untold misery to the tribals in the area.” Some steps taken to help the local people, the court said, seemed “not more than a drop in the ocean —also too little, too late”.

The stern words from the highest judicial authority in the country are abreath of fresh air in the otherwise polluted approach toward green issues some authorities have demonstrated in recent years.

On top of the hall of shame is the Delhi government’s ill-conceived oddeven scheme that banned half the cars in the city on alternate days, but had no problems with smoky and noisy diesel generators or smoke-spewing, overloaded trucks.

Then there was the ban on 10-yearold diesel cars, which were sold in full compliance of the prevailing emission norms and a declaration to customers that these cars will be legally allowed for 15 years. It didn’t matter to the authorities that a newer car that is not properly maintained will pollute the air much more. Or that the actual emission is more important than the age.

The problem with such steps is that it creates mass public ill-will towards the noble cause of environmental protection simply because some authority has caused severe hardship with steps that scientists know wouldn’t clean the air. Such orders actually damage the environment because they make it difficult for political authorities to protect the environment when the common man thinks he is being short-changed.

Green and Bear It

In contrast, the Supreme Court’s latest verdict on mining, and GoI’s submission early this year, is a concrete step that will help the environment, even as some mining companies have genuine grievances.

The mining industry fears the verdict will disrupt business and that some mines may shut down. There are some legitimate grouses. It takes ages to get environmental clearances. Often, land is not available for compensatory afforestation. At times, clearances are not renewed even if there is no change in mining operations or output.

Legitimate concerns must be addressed. But for the crooks who ravage the environment, the message from the Supreme Court and the government is clear: if abiding by the law means shutting down your business, so be it."
5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. 🌼 A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

Baby boy 👦💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It’s time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibe💤 A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you’re a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you’re not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime 💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."

As the world’s largest zero-subsidy government LED distribution programme, this is an extraordinary example of successful energy efficiency programmes that we believe should be replicated in Melaka, ”Chief Minister of Melaka, Malaysia, Datuk Seri Utama Ir. Haji Idris bin Haron, said in a statement released by EESL on Friday.Being the Chairman of the Green Growth Asia Advisory Committee, he also is keen on collaborating with EESL in other programmes in addition to the UJALA scheme , the statement added.The UJALA scheme implemented by EESL has now become a global case study, whereby we have been approached by the governments of many countries to seek assistance for implementation of similar interventions in the energy efficiency space, with the Government of Melaka being the latest addition. In line with this, we have already commenced talks with the Green Growth Asia Advisory Committee soon to assess their requirements.” Raj Kumar Rakhra, National Programme Manager (UJALA), EESL, said.Currently, over 255 million LED bulbs, over 3.6 million LED tubelights and around 1.15 million energy efficient fans have been distributed in the country under the UJALA scheme, according to the ministry of power The scheme has resulted in annual energy savings of over 33,400 million units of power and avoided peak demand of 6,725 MW.According to EESL, the scheme is estimated to lead to cumulative cost reduction in bills of consumers of over Rs 13,346 crore annually apart from reduction of around 27 million tonne of carbon emissions every year."

Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.
