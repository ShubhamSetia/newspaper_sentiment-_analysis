Shahid Afridi blasts 42-ball century in Natwest T20,"Shahid Afridi scored his first T20 century during NatWest T20 Blast match. Shahid Afridi scored his first T20 century during NatWest T20 Blast match.

Former Pakistan skipper Shahid Afridi scored 101 from 43 balls in the NatWest t20 Blast match while playing for Hampshire against Derbyshire that included ten boundaries and seven maximums. The right-hander scored his first T20 hundred in 256 matches that came in 42 deliveries. The Derbyshire skipper Gary Wilson after winning the toss elected to bowl first.

Afridi along with wicket-keeper batsman Calvin Dickinson scored 43 for the first wicket before Dickinson was out for 18 by Ben Cotton. The fall of wicket didn‚Äôt really effect Afridi‚Äôs scoring rate as he continued to hammer Derbyshire bowlers all around the park.

Afridi then stitched a partnership of 97 runs with captain James Vince for second wicket.

The former Pakistan cricketer‚Äôs innings was put to an end by New Zealand fast bowler Matt Henry after he pulled a short delivery only to give a catch to Ben Cotton at deep fine leg area.

Hampshire went on to compile a total of 249/8 in 20 overs which is the highest T20 score in Derbyshire. Skipper Vince too chipped in with a fifty during their innings.

Afridi has always been known as one of the most aggressive batsmen in world cricket and the right-hander displayed his abilities in the very first innings that he played in 1996 against Sri Lanka.

The right-hander scored the then fastest hundred in limited overs which came off just 37 balls. His long-standing record was later broken by Corey Anderson in 2014 who completed hundred runs in 36 balls.

An year later, the record was grabbed by South Africa‚Äôs AB de Villiers who smacked a ton in 31 balls against West Indies in 2015.

"After Barcelona attack, Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull calls for designs to prevent vehicle attacks","Turnbull said the government was concerned about a young Australian who remains unaccounted for following the Barcelona attack. (Source: Reuters) Turnbull said the government was concerned about a young Australian who remains unaccounted for following the Barcelona attack. (Source: Reuters)

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called on Sunday for developers to incorporate safety features into their projects to prevent militant attacks with vehicles and other weapons as he announced new plans to protect the public. Turnbull unveiled Australia‚Äôs first national strategy to protect crowded places, which he said was initiated after an Islamist militant drove a truck into crowds in the French city of Nice in last year, killing 84 people.

It comes days after a similar attack in the Spanish city of Barcelona killed 13 and injuring more than 100, and follows a string of similar vehicle attacks around the world. Turnbull told reporters the plan was designed for councils, businesses and venue operators to stop attacks with vehicles as well as with guns, knives, bombs or chemical devices. Steps include the installation of bollards along main streets, and at shopping centres and outside sporting grounds.

Turnbull said while sites would be better protected, developers had to incorporate safety features into new projects on the drawing board. ‚ÄúThe best mitigation are done at the design,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe most important thing is that, as you get new developments, new plans, that security measures are put in place at that time.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe threat is constantly evolving, and so what we have to do is make sure that we too are constantly improving and updating the measures we have to keep Australians safe.‚Äù Australia, a staunch U.S. ally that has sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, has been on alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, or their supporters.

There have been several ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù attacks and officials say 13 significant plots have been foiled in the past few years. In January, a man drove into pedestrians in the city of Melbourne, killing four and injuring more than 20. Police said that incident was not terrorism-related but the city has put up about 140 concrete bollards around its centre.

Turnbull said the government was concerned about a young Australian who remains unaccounted for following the Barcelona attack. The seven-year-old boy, Julian Cadman, who British media says has British and Australian nationality, was separated from his mother who was taken to hospital in serious condition ‚ÄúWe pray that little boy will be found and be restored alive to his parents,‚Äù he said.

Doklam foretold,"Representational Image Representational Image

The Doklam stand-off was inevitable. It may be resolved peacefully but it is a manifestation of the larger geopolitical contest that is playing out in Asia between India and China. How do we respond? Economically, it is a no-contest because it is only in 2030 that India will reach the size of China‚Äôs 2014 GDP. Perhaps the answers lie in geography. Expanding from its peripheries, China has economically secured its borders.

Trade with the five Central Asian republics has risen from $1.8 billion in 2000 to $50 billion in 2013. Northward, the Han Chinese have moved into inner Mongolia and invested heavily in underground metals in Mongolia. About 90 per cent of Mongolian exports go to China. The Chinese population in its Northeast region is also slowly creeping across the border into the Russian Far East. In Southeast Asia, the economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are closely tied to China. The total trade volume of ASEAN with China is projected to increase to $1 trillion by 2020.

Chinese presence in Afghanistan and its massive investment in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor has enabled China to effectively skirt the Himalayan barrier and come to India‚Äôs northwest, a region to which India has been historically sensitive because it was the main invasion route into the Subcontinent. Moving into South Asia, China has become the largest trading partner of Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is developing the Gwadar port in Pakistan, has taken over the operation of Hambantota in Sri Lanka and operationalised the gas and oil pipelines from Myanmar‚Äôs Kyaukpyu port to Kunming. However, the Chinese also have major geographical weaknesses in the maritime domain.

Along its Pacific coast, China is hemmed in by Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Indonesia. The East China Sea and South China Sea are bitterly contested and there is a strong US Navy presence with its ‚ÄúFreedom of Navigation‚Äù operations. China has not been a traditional naval power but clearly understands that it can no longer remain continental. This is reflected in the shift in China‚Äôs strategy to also encompass ‚Äúfar seas‚Äù protection in addition to ‚Äúnear sea‚Äù defence. The primary ‚Äúfar sea‚Äù is the Indian Ocean, across which flow not only Chinese oil but raw materials sourced from Sub-Saharan Africa. India is also constrained by geography. It is hemmed in from the north by the Himalayas and the west by a hostile Pakistan. East and south are the only natural gateways and that should dictate our strategy.

A serious push has to be given to India‚Äôs ‚ÄúAct East‚Äù policy. The Chinese influence in Southeast Asia looks extremely strong but there are signs of cracks due to a rising anti-China sentiment. Ethnic tensions have led to the Chinese leaving Malaysia. According to the home minister of Malaysia, of the 56,576 Malaysians who renounced their citizenship between 2006 and 2016, 49,864 were Chinese. Tiny Singapore, fearful of Chinese domination, has the highest military expenditure in ASEAN. Infrastructure projects in Myanmar and Thailand have been stalled or delayed on environmental concerns. There are maritime disputes in the South China Sea with the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.

With confusion about Trump‚Äôs strategic focus and uncertainty over the US rebalance to Asia, ASEAN countries are going to look towards India and Japan to provide a counterweight to China. However, to be considered a serious player in this region, India must enhance its credibility. The India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway, conceived in 2002, has already missed its scheduled date and is now expected to be completed by 2020. The Imphal-Mandalay bus service, which had a trial run in 2015, has not started because of poor road connectivity. Such instances don‚Äôt inspire confidence in Indian capability. It could be argued that India stepping into China‚Äôs area of influence could exacerbate tensions but it is clear that the seriousness of India-China rivalry is a reality and has to be faced. In any event, with China showing little concern to Indian sensitivities in South Asia, there is little need to defer to China.

The Indian Ocean is another area where India and China will vie for supremacy. The Indian Navy needs to be significantly strengthened. We should turn the Indian map upside down and look more towards the Indian Ocean where, unlike China, there is no neighbour to contest Indian supremacy. The three services also need to put aside their differences and provide sufficient resources to the Andaman and Nicobar Command, which will be in the frontline of future Indian strategy.

A flashpoint along the Himalayan border is not impossible. We could see military action but the difficulties of geography rule out a decisive engagement in this area. Of course, the poor infrastructure along the border needs immediate attention if we are not to be distracted in our geostrategic approach with Depsang, Chumar and Doklam type of incidents. The air force needs strengthening, not only with aircraft but radars for warning and a strong air defence cover, both of which are almost absent along the northern borders.

With the establishment of the Strategic Support Force in late 2015 it is clear that the PLA is set on integrating space and cyber tools as an integral part of warfighting. We have to immediately put in place structures and capabilities to counter this threat. An almost total reliance on foreign hardware and software, lot of it Chinese, puts us at grave risk.

All this will require a long-term strategic push and an enhancement in defence expenditure. According to the IHS Jane report of 2015, China‚Äôs defence expenditure could grow to $233 billion by 2020 while Indian projections are at $64 billion. With major military shortfalls in almost all areas, the current allocations are just not sufficient. India‚Äôs future global status will be determined by its competition with China. A successful trading relationship cannot overcome the reality of this competition. India must not only secure her troubled borders but also be ready to challenge China in those areas that offer opportunities to us. This will require both a clear geopolitical vision and resources to convert this vision to reality.

Geoffrey Boycott apologises after racist remarks,"Geoffrey Boycott, arguably the best defensive batsman of his generation, played for Yorkshire from 1962-1986 and had a stint as county captain. (Source: Express File) Geoffrey Boycott, arguably the best defensive batsman of his generation, played for Yorkshire from 1962-1986 and had a stint as county captain. (Source: Express File)

Former England legendary batsman Geoffrey Boycott has apologised after making racist remarks where he suggested he needed to ‚Äòblack up‚Äô to get a knighthood. He made the crass comment to VIP guests at the day-night Test against West Indies in Edgbaston. But he has since apologised on Twitter by ‚Äòapologise unreservedly‚Äô for his comments. Among the 11 West Indian cricketers knighted are Sir Curtly Ambrose, Sir Garfield Sobers and Sir Viv Richards.

At a Q&A session during a break in play at Edgbaston on Saturday, the BCC Test Match Special Commentator said knighthoods were handed out like ‚Äúconfetti‚Äù to West Indies greats.

Boycott told Sky Sports presenter Gary Newbon, hosting the session: ‚ÄúMine‚Äôs been turned down twice. I‚Äôd better black me face.‚Äù It was followed by an uneasy silence at a gathering in Birmingham where diners, including several black guests, had paid nearly ¬£300 each for a luxury hospitality package.

Waheed Saleem, who was in the audience of the Q&A when Boycott made the remarks, told BBC Sport: ‚ÄúI was completely disgusted. I don‚Äôt think anyone saw it as a light-hearted joke. I was absolutely gobsmacked.‚Äù

Following the condemnation, Boycott tweeted, ‚ÄúSpeaking at an informal gathering I was asked a question and I realise my answer was unacceptable. I meant no offence but what I said was clearly wrong and I apologise unreservedly. I have loved West Indian cricket my whole life and have the utmost respect for its players,‚Äù he wrote in three part tweets.

Beware the Trump effect,"For a feel for the Trump effect on regional tensions, let‚Äôs fast-forward to his first foreign visit: Saudi Arabia. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar) For a feel for the Trump effect on regional tensions, let‚Äôs fast-forward to his first foreign visit: Saudi Arabia. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)

This is a tale of two septuagenarians; I hope they never meet. One is the country of India as an independent democratic nation. The other is the American president, a reminder that independent democracy provides no guarantee for its product. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Washington DC, he extended an invitation to the Trump parivaar to visit India. Ivanka Trump accepted right away and recently the details of her visit have been re-confirmed by the official medium of this White House ‚Äî over a tweet. While Ivanka‚Äôs appearance would be harmless enough, it would be best if Daddy chooses to stay away.

Daddy‚Äôs appearances elsewhere have followed a worrisome pattern: Wherever principles of tolerance and civility are already under attack, Daddy‚Äôs appearance tips the balance, making a bad situation worse. The craziest elements feel empowered to do crazier things. Given that the kettle of intolerance is coming to a boil in India, a Trump senior visit would not be a good thing. Consider three theatres of activity: America, Saudi Arabia and Poland. Each is a country where civil society was already under siege before Trump stepped on to the stage.

In keeping with the slogan, consider America first. The US has been struggling with growing tensions involving race relations, deep political divisions and anti-Islamic rhetoric, and much of it had been nearing a tipping point in the years since Obama‚Äôs election. Enter Trump; his election rallies unleashed the beast within. Hateful speech and action became de rigueur at Trump rallies. Intolerance has mushroomed around the country. A telling statistic comes from Trump‚Äôs home base, New York City, right after his election.

In an interview last November, New York‚Äôs police commissioner cited a 31 per cent increase in hate crimes when compared to the same time from the previous year. He specifically pointed out that crimes directed at Muslims more than doubled, while anti-Semitic crimes had gone up by 9 per cent. In recent days, the historic college-town of Charlottesville, Virginia, was the scene of white supremacists running amok, emboldened by the ascendance of Trumpism; of course, the fact that Trump took his own sweet time to lay the blame squarely on racist bigotry helped re-affirm to the bigots that he has their backs.

For a feel for the Trump effect on regional tensions, let‚Äôs fast-forward to his first foreign visit: Saudi Arabia. The itinerary is marked by much bonhomie and revelry, including a traditional Arab ardah, a dance with sabres in which Trump participated but seemed out of step with his hosts given the unfamiliar rhythm. However, the synchronicity returned with the real sabre-rattling that followed. Saudi Arabia along with several other countries, including the UAE, Yemen, Egypt and Bahrain got busy after the visit to cut ties with Qatar, precipitating a crisis in a region that is in no need of fresh crises.

The UAE Foreign Minister confirmed that Trump‚Äôs visit was the trigger. To show, no doubt, that he was dancing in step, Trump tweeted a day later: ‚ÄúDuring my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar ‚Äî look!‚Äù

Fast-forward again. We are now a month into the Qatar crisis, Trump is in a different part of the world, Poland, where the populist Law and Justice party mastermind, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, shares his fondness for authoritarianism. The party has also bussed-in people to ensure a rapturous crowd for Trump‚Äôs speech in Warsaw‚Äôs iconic Krasinski Square. Trump reads his tele-prompted speech pitting the West against the barbarians everywhere else, moves on and the party autocrats move in: The government passes legislation that would give politicians absolute control over the judicial system. Supreme Court judges would be required to step down, giving the justice minister the power to decide who should stay on; politicians would control who sits on the council that nominates Supreme Court judges; the justice minister would select and dismiss judges in lower courts at will. The catalyst? Once again, the rascals pointed to Trump and his professed admiration for the ruling party‚Äôs autocratic ways.

Now let‚Äôs talk about India. It has been 70 years of the Indian experiment and, sadly, there has been a resurgence of the intolerance that accompanied India‚Äôs Independence. Far from ‚ÄúIncredible India‚Äù, news headlines internationally suggest ‚Äúinedible India‚Äù: The worst aspects of humanity or its lack thereof that were on full display during Partition are slowly but surely making their way back into the mainstream. Today, the traces of that historic inhumanity are still evident as stories of beef lynchings and mob attacks on Muslims have taken the place of stories that should be about an emerging nation with the greatest potential for growth in its history.

The Modi administration has presided over more than 60 incidents of cow-related mob violence. While there has been some tsk-tsk-ing from the prime minister‚Äôs office about this, what is one to make of the elevation of the warrior-priest, Yogi Adityanath, according to whom India‚Äôs more than 170 million Muslims are ‚Äúa crop of two-legged animals that has to be stopped‚Äù?

It has been 70 years of freedom from colonial rule, but freedom of expression appears to be back on the endangered list. The raid on the NDTV founders, ostensibly, for an unpaid bank loan, is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. The documentary, The Argumentative Indian, featuring the Nobel laureate who shall not go quietly into the night, has words such as ‚Äúcow‚Äù and ‚ÄúGujarat‚Äù deemed a tad too argumentative by the censors. Of course, not all expression is suppressed by Indian authorities. BJP MP and actor, Paresh Rawal, can attest to that after being forced to delete a tweet suggesting that Arundhati Roy, novelist and b√™te noire of Hindu chauvinism, be tied to the bonnet of a jeep.

It has been 70 years since India‚Äôs tryst with destiny; yet today India ranks fourth out of 198 countries on a ‚ÄúSocial Hostilities Index‚Äù created by the Pew Research Center that analyses many indicators, including crimes motivated by religious hatred, mob and communal violence, religion-related terrorist groups, using force against certain religious groups, the harassment of women for violating religious dress codes and violence over conversion.

To be sure, it takes far more than a mere 70 years to eradicate intolerance and bigotry and social division. After all, these have all been part and parcel of the complex history of the Subcontinent for millennia. It is frustrating to note that the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù of India as promised back in 1947 as a secular democracy dreamt of by idealists has been transformed into a new normalisation of intolerance.

Now imagine a visit from Donald Trump, maybe even a speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. Imagine crowds bussed in from Yogi Adityanath‚Äôs UP ‚Äî borrowing a page from the Polish playbook ‚Äî and ceremonial sabre-rattling dances with tridents instead of Arab swords, with due credit for the idea to the Saudis, despite the fact that the tridents would probably be pointed at their fellow Muslims. Just imagine the licence the Trumpian imprimatur would provide to those who are already itching to do more mischief, much like what just transpired with white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Trump and independent India might share a 70 years-plus life span. However, the latter can still right itself; it is on track to soon be home to the world‚Äôs youngest population, and one can hope that the youth can transcend history and dream of a different ‚Äî truly tolerant and secular ‚Äî future, one with more opportunities for social and economic mobility. Let the young democracy celebrate its 70 years free from the 70 year-olds, Trump and other poisoned politicians, who carry the burden of bigotry of the past with them. If Ivanka ‚Äî and even her hapless brothers ‚Äî visit, I think that would be just about as many Trumps that India can currently handle.

"Donald Trump‚Äôs harsh words for Pakistan reflects US government‚Äôs frustration, says former AS Nisha Desai Biswal","President Donald Trump speaks at Fort Myer in Arlington during a Presidential Address to the Nation. (Source: Reuters) President Donald Trump speaks at Fort Myer in Arlington during a Presidential Address to the Nation. (Source: Reuters)

President Donald Trump‚Äôs harsh words for Pakistan while announcing his Afghanistan and South Asia strategy reflects the growing frustration within the US government over Islamabad‚Äôs continued support for cross-border terrorism, a former American diplomat said. Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to the nation as commander-in-chief, warned Pakistan of consequences for providing safe havens to terrorists and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. He ruled out a hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to end America‚Äôs longest war. ‚ÄúPresident Trump tonight presented the nation with his strategy for Afghanistan ‚Äî a strategy that largely continued the approach of the previous administration, with a few key distinctions,‚Äù former Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia in the Obama administration Nisha Desai Biswal.

‚ÄúFirst let me say ‚Äî the most dramatic shifts were not in US policy towards Afghanistan but in the attitude of the president himself‚Äîgoing from the withdrawal he had advocated during the campaign to essentially continuing, and even augmenting the troop levels for the foreseeable future,‚Äù she told PTI. In announcing the strategy, she said Trump acknowledged the potential vacuum, and instability that would result from a precipitous withdrawal. ‚ÄúContinued US presence at current or near current levels,while not enough to stabilise Afghanistan, can at least keep it from collapsing entirely. The president‚Äôs announcement will provide some reassurances to the region which feared a US vacuum,‚Äù she said. Biswal said Trump seemed to focus almost entirely on the counter-terrorism mission, again pointing to a narrow mission aimed not at building a stable and viable Afghanistan but merely on preventing deterioration and preventing threats to the American homeland.

‚ÄúA military strategy without an accompanying diplomatic and development strategy can at best be a band-aid to stop the bleeding but it will not address the underlying problems. To be fair, the two prior administrations also failed to successfully address the underlying challenges,‚Äù she said. The president‚Äôs harsh language for Pakistan reflect the‚Äùgrowing frustration‚Äù within the US government ‚Äîincluding in military and intelligence circles‚Äîwith Pakistan‚Äôs continued support for terror groups carrying out attacks in Afghanistan and India and its diminishing cooperation with the US, Biswal said. ‚ÄúWhile the tougher stance may be warranted, I have not seen high-level diplomatic engagement to manage there actions,‚Äù said the former top American diplomat.

The president also prioritised India as a partner that can play a larger role, she said. ‚ÄúWhile India has provided significant economic assistance to Afghanistan, it has not played a larger political or military role. That has largely been a mutually supported decision ‚Äî the US, sensitive to Pakistani reactions, did not want Indian boots on the ground, and India for its part also did not want to put its troops into Afghanistan,‚Äù she noted. However, with the US patience with Pakistan wearing thinner by the day, there is less heed being paid to Pakistan sensitivities and a greater expectation that India, with much at stake, should take on a greater share of the burden, Biswal said. And there is much India can do, without taking on a kinetic role. It can provide training and equipment to the Afghan military and provide more substantial support for the Afghan trust fund, she said.

‚ÄúWhile many will take issue with the president‚Äôs blunt language linking trade and burden sharing, I already seee fforts by State and Department of Defence to soften the approach to India,‚Äù she said. However, for Afghanistan to be successful, stable and economically viable, there must be a robust regional diplomatic strategy, she added.

Gerard Deulofeu stars for Barcelona in shadow of terror attack,"Gerard Deulofeu played well enough against Real Betis. (Source: Reuters) Gerard Deulofeu played well enough against Real Betis. (Source: Reuters)

Barcelona got off to a winning start in La Liga on Sunday, beating Real Betis 2-0 in a subdued atmosphere at the Nou Camp after the deadly attacks in the Catalan capital and the town of Cambrils.

Rivals Real Madrid began their pursuit of back-to-back league titles for the first time since 2008 with a 3-0 win at Deportivo La Coruna with goals from Gareth Bale, Casemiro and Toni Kroos, although captain Sergio Ramos was sent off in the dying seconds, earning a 23rd career red card.

Betis defender Alin Tosca diverted a cross from the lively Gerard Deulofeu into his own net to put Barca ahead in the 36th minute, while the former Everton forward, who returned to his boyhood club this summer, also laid on the pass for the second goal which was smashed in by Sergi Roberto in the 39th.

Lionel Messi was the fulcrum of most of Barca‚Äôs creativity and more responsibility was placed on his shoulders due to the absence of Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta.

But the Argentine was denied a goal, hitting the woodwork three times. There was a solemn feeling at the Nou Camp before and during the game with only 56,480 supporters at the 99,000-capacity arena. The club announced it had granted fans‚Äô requests to return tickets in the wake of Thursday‚Äôs attacks, which killed 14 people and injured more than 100.

‚ÄúIt was a moving tribute, we wanted to celebrate this victory and I dedicated the (first) goal to the victims and their families,‚Äù Deulofeu told reporters. ‚ÄúWhat happened was terrible, we hope something like this never happens again. We are not afraid but this needs to stop. This victory was for them.‚Äù

RUTHLESS REAL

In Coruna, Deportivo made a flying start against Real but wasted three early chances to surprise the champions. The first two fell to Romanian striker Florin Andone, who was twice foiled by Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Real, by contrast, were utterly ruthless.

Isco and Marcelo drove Zinedine Zidane‚Äôs side forward from the left and moved the ball for Luka Modric to shoot at goal. The Croatian‚Äôs tame shot slipped out of the hands of goalkeeper Ruben Martinez to the feet of Karim Benzema, who rolled the ball across for Bale to nudge home. Real then showed their class with their second goal after a long period of possession, with Marcelo sliding the ball to the far post where Casemiro was waiting to tuck into the unguarded net, completing a move involving 44 passes.

‚ÄúWe aspire to play like this and we know we have the players to do it and we have worked very hard to score a goal like the second and we are all delighted with it,‚Äù Zidane told reporters. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very happy with how the game went although not with what happened to Sergio. In general we‚Äôre happy because this isn‚Äôt an easy place to go, Deportivo can cause you problems and they had their chances today.‚Äù Toni Kroos met a Bale cutback to strike Real‚Äôs third in the 62nd minute while Deportivo striker Florin Andone completed a miserable night by squandering a late penalty.

Spain centre back Ramos, who has never been sent off in 143 games for his country, earned a second yellow card in injury time, joining Pablo Alfaro and Xavi Aguado on a La Liga record of 18 red cards.

Negotiators from the US, Canada and Mexico have concluded the first round of the North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) talks here to redo the three-nation trade pact, the media reported. Representatives from the three countries said on Sunday that negotiations will continue at a ‚Äúrapid pace‚Äù, adding that ‚Äúa great deal of effort and negotiation will be required in the coming months‚Äù, reports CNN.

The countries ‚Äúare committed to an accelerated and comprehensive negotiation process‚Äù that will establish ‚Äú21st century standards‚Äù that benefit citizens, they said in a statement. Round two of the NAFTA talks are set to be held for September 1-5 in Mexico City. The third: late September in Ottawa and round four will be held in Washington, D.C. in October.

In total, seven rounds are expected through December, CNN reported. However, a US official cautioned that December was not a firm deadline and that talks could stretch into early 2018. The round one of talks included each of the three sides discussing their expectations about the ‚Äúrules of origins‚Äù issue, according to a Mexican government official.

No firm proposals were made. Meanwhile, since his campaign days, US President Donald Trump has slammed NAFTA, which took effect in 1994, as detrimental to American interests and pledged to withdraw Washington from the deal unless it can be revised.

Trump said the agreement has led to massive US job losses, provided incentives for companies to relocate their operations to Mexico in search of cheaper labour and caused Washington‚Äôs trade deficit with its southern neighbour to soar.

Tripura Cricket Association will build a world-class cricket stadium, with a seating capacity of 25,000, in collaboration with BCCI at Narsinghgarh near Tripura.

‚ÄúIt is a Rs 200 crore project of which 50 per cent would be borne by BCCI and the rest by TCA,‚Äù TCA secretary Tapas Dey told reporters today.

It will be a modern stadium having all facilities and will be capable of holding all types of international matches, he said. Chief Minister Manik Sarkar yesterday laid the foundation stone of the stadium, which will be the second largest cricket stadium in the north-east after the stadium in Guwahati.

Sarkar said, ‚ÄúIt is a good initiative by the TCA and will provide further opportunity to young cricket players in the state.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have no dearth of sports talent in the state but we need to train them properly,‚Äù Sarkar said.

The club house will be a seven-storied building and will have good lifts, modern gymnasium and electronic score boards.

Ragan Smith rolls to US gymnastics title,"Ragan Smith‚Äôs 57.850 total in the finals was the best in the 16-woman all-around field by nearly two points. (Source: Reuters) Ragan Smith‚Äôs 57.850 total in the finals was the best in the 16-woman all-around field by nearly two points. (Source: Reuters)

Ragan Smith embraced the role of heavy favorite coming into the U.S. gymnastics championships. Thrust into the spotlight for the first time in her career, the 17-year-old Smith hardly appeared intimidated by the stage. Smith pulled away from the field to claim her first national title Sunday, posting a score of 115.250, more than three points clear of Jordan Chiles in second place and Riley McCusker in third.

Smith opened up a 1.3-point lead over McCusker in the opening round Friday but admitted afterward she wasn‚Äôt particularly impressed by her own performance. She was considerably sharper less than 48 hours later, her 57.850 total in the finals was the best in the 16-woman all-around field by nearly two points.

Smith is one of the few holdovers from the 2016 Olympic cycle, serving as an alternate for the ‚ÄúFinal Five‚Äù team that won half of the available medals in Rio de Janeiro last fall. Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, Aly Raisman, Madison Kocian and Laurie Hernandez are taking breaks or have moved on, leaving Smith as the standard bearer for new national team coordinator Valeri Liukin.

The program appears to be in solid hands. Smith ditched ‚ÄúThe Addams Family‚Äù themed floor routine she used last year for something a little more mature. It‚Äôs not the only part of her gymnastics that has grown up. Smith finished first on floor and beam and tied for third on bars.

Smith will be in the mix for the all-around title at the world championships in Montreal, where she‚Äôll have a chance to extend the U.S.‚Äôs dominance. An American woman has won the world or Olympic title each of the last six years. Barring injury, Smith should be right there.

Liukin said he wasn‚Äôt alarmed following an uneven performance by the field in preliminaries, calling it a positive step for a group lacking in experience. The gymnastics were markedly improved in the finals.

Chiles slipped by McCusker into second thanks to a fabulous save on beam in which she turned a near disaster into something decidedly artful. Chiles was in the middle of ‚Äúwolf turn‚Äù (basically spinning on one foot while in a crouch on a 4-inch wide piece of wood) when she nearly fell over. Instead she rose to her feet, kept rotating, and went right into the next part of her routine as if it was planned all along.

Chiles‚Äô steadiness gives Liukin another option as he tries to put together the rest of the four-woman team that will join Smith in Montreal. McCusker, only recently recovered from foot and wrist injuries, tried to keep the heat on Smith but stepped out of bounds following the last tumbling pass on her floor routine. McCusker finished first on bars her legs practically magnetized together as she went from bar to bar to win the event with ease.

Ashton Locklear, like Smith an alternate last summer, wound up second on bars with a watered down routine as he makes her way back from her own injury issues and should have time to install upgrades before Montreal.

Whoever heads to Canada in October will go with the usual expectations for what has become the sport‚Äôs most dominant program.

"Test cricket desperately needs a new structure, and now","England spanked West Indies by an innings and 209 runs in the first match of the series. (Source: Reuters) England spanked West Indies by an innings and 209 runs in the first match of the series. (Source: Reuters)

‚ÄúWest Indies were embarrassing and pathetic‚Ä¶ they just threw in the towel,‚Äù wrote Curtly Ambrose in his column for Daily after West Indies‚Äô demoralising loss to England in the first game of the three-Test series. West Indies were thrashed by an innings and 209 runs by England at Edgbaston in a dismal show that saw 19 West Indies wickets fall on the third day. This continued West Indies‚Äô dismal run of 17 years of not winning a Test in England.

As one West Indies wicket fell after another, much like dominoes, not only did England inch towards yet another home win ‚Äì after winning 3-1 against South Africa ‚Äì it made brutally clear that not only West Indies cricket but the sport itself needs a change.

Earlier this month, Sri Lanka were swept aside by India on their home soil. Both with bat and ball, Sri Lanka failed to match their opposition and surrendered without putting up a fight. From a 304-run defeat to two innings defeats in consecutive Tests, Sri Lanka were outplayed in conditions they call home. Sri Lanka are only one step above West Indies in the current ICC Test rankings (seven with 90 rating points).

Even South Africa‚Äôs tour of England saw massive victory margins ‚Äì 211 runs, 239 runs and 177 runs ‚Äì between the second and third ranked teams. Beyond anything, it highlighted England‚Äôs dominance at home and the ability to make the most of it in terms of results. And it also highlighted how most teams, in last two years, have struggled to replicate home success away.

However, what the sport needs is a division system to bring in some context. There are multiple bi-lateral series which mean nothing unless there is some context to it ‚Äì history, background, rivalry and/or above everything, something that is riding on each game.

‚ÄúI was telling one of the broadcasters about a plan for the World Test championship. Ten teams have to be divided into two divisions and they play four matches each. If it‚Äôs a four-day match with 100 overs a day, the tournament can be done and dusted in 50 days. If a team scores more than 300, you get four batting points. If you get all 10 wickets before 100 overs, you get your bowling points. So teams will be aggressive in their approach. In the mid 90s, county cricket in England had this format when I was playing there. I think the current Futures Tour Programme (FTP) gets over in June 2019. If ICC works out a plan for a World Test championship, three out of every four years we will have a major tournament. That will be good for the sport,‚Äù said Dean Jones as a measure to promote Test cricket with numbers dwindling.

While this method, or any other method, needs to be ratified by the ICC and other member Test nations, it is a step in the right direction if the game is to move forward in the right direction. Barring the Ashes, India vs Australia and the now disbarred India-Pakistan series, none of the other bi-lateral competitions have substance to them. Introduce a five team two-tier system and you make every game count and matter.

But the biggest challenge in this system is that of getting the full time members such as Sri Lanka or West Indies to vote to drop to Tier-2 where the money will be lesser. It is no surprise that teams earn more when they play the likes of India or Australia in their backyard, take that away and the lucrative TV money contracts and advertising revenues suffer.

In lieu, another approach would be to have a league structure involving the ten teams with everyone playing one and another in a home and away format. The eventual toppers are crowned winners and the championship is held for a stipulated time period.

If not, statements such as ‚ÄúThere is no one there to teach them (West Indies). I really fear that this series (against England) could be one of the saddest for Test cricket‚Äù by Michael Vaughan would be made more frequently and you wouldn‚Äôt be too far off from the truth.

Alastair Cook remains threat to Sachin Tendulkar‚Äôs record,"Alastair Cook scored 243 in first Test against West Indies. (Source: Reuters) Alastair Cook scored 243 in first Test against West Indies. (Source: Reuters)

Sachin Tendulkar‚Äôs record of most Test runs and most Test matches played are something (of many!) that put him apart. His absolute awe inspiring numbers of playing 200 Tests and then calling it a day in a splendid career spanning 24 years will leave anyone‚Äôs jaw dropped. His Test runs tally of 15,921 with 51 centuries at an average of 53.78 only add to the legend of the Master Blaster and the herculean task it must have been to dismiss him.

There are many more legends of the sport behind him ‚Äì Ricky Ponting (13,378 runs), Jacques Kallis (13,289 runs), Rahul Dravid (13,288 runs), Kumar Sangakkara (12,400 runs), Brian Lara (11,953 runs), Shivnarine Chanderpaul (11,867 runs), Mahela Jayawardene (11,814 runs) and then comes the only player who can surpass Tendulkar‚Äôs record ‚Äì Alastair Cook (11,568 runs). Only Cook is the player who is still around and playing the sport. And he remains the only threat to Sachin‚Äôs record which was set four years back when the Indian batsman played his last against West Indies.

With the current numbers, Cook stands 4,353 runs behind Sachin‚Äôs tally and given the England batsman‚Äôs propensity to hit the bowlers around, the odds of the total being surpassed don‚Äôt look too grim. There are multiple things that go in Cook‚Äôs favour ‚Äì he is 32 years old and comes up to bat at the top of the order. He gave a perfect example of what he can do to mediocre bowling by scoring 243 runs against West Indies in the opening day-night Test at Edgbaston. Further, England play at least 15 Tests in a single calendar year (they played 17 in 2016) which gives lots of room to breach the tally.

Additionally, Cook has his sight firmly focused on Test matches. His last T20I came in 2009 and ODI in 2014. His intention is clear ‚Äì keep an eye on the longest format of the game. Should Cook play for four or five more years, which is expected given how long cricketers play for, he can quite easily surpass Sachin‚Äôs record.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau marched in Montreal‚Äôs Gay Pride parade, joined by Ireland‚Äôs first openly gay leader Leo Varadkar. Sporting white jeans and a casual light blue button-up,Trudeau waved a rainbow flag with Indian-origin Varadkar at his side as they participated in the annual event where several thousand people had gathered.

Earlier in the day at a joint press conference Trudeau vowed ‚Äústrength through diversity‚Äù in the face of recent attacks in Spain and Burkina Faso. ‚ÄúThese recent acts of terror are despicable,‚Äù the Canadian leader said. ‚ÄúThey seek to divide the global community, aiming to pit neighbour against neighbour. ‚ÄúBut these cowards will not win,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe will continue to do as we have done, standing united and stronger in the face of hatred. ‚ÄúWe will be emboldened in our values, values of love, acceptance, and strength through diversity.‚Äù

Prime Minister Varadkar, who took office in June, is the first foreign head of government to join a Canadian pride celebration. He said Canada and Ireland must work in tandem to advance equal rights, particularly in places where they are threatened. ‚ÄúWhat we have most in common is that we are countries that understand that diversity is our strength and our differences make us better,‚Äù Varadkar said.

Petra Kvitova‚Äôs final tuneup for the U.S. Open ended with a 6-2, 6-1 loss to Shuai Zhang of China in the first round of the Connecticut Open.

Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion and a three-time champion in New Haven, is just 4-4 on hard courts this season. The Czech player returned to the tour at the French Open in May after she was stabbed during a home invasion in December, leaving her dominant left hand seriously injured.

Zhang, ranked 29th, was playing her first match in the United States since April. ‚ÄúI just arrived in New Haven last night, coming straight from China,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big change. It‚Äôs 12 hours‚Äô time difference. Before the match I was still sleeping.‚Äù

"Micromax Canvas Infinity first impressions: Infinity display at a budget, but will it be a hit?","Micromax Canvas Infinity has been launched, but is it any good? Here are our first impressions. Micromax Canvas Infinity has been launched, but is it any good? Here are our first impressions.

Over the past couple of quarters Micromax has been struggling to make a dent in the Indian smartphone market, which it held with a vice-like grip for many years. Micromax did try to revamp its portfolio and offer a high-end Dual 5, but the phone did not get the desired traction. This look towards the top was necessitated by the fact that at the entry-level, it has been beaten by Chinese brands offering better value for money for the user. Micromax badly needs a hit and it hopes the Canvas Infinity will be the success it needs.

Micromax Canvas Infinity should be seen as a departure from the company‚Äôs previous smartphones. What‚Äôs different about the Canvas Infinity is that it puts a massive screen inside a compact body, offering the 18:9 aspect ratio. The company is confident about the Canvas Infinity, although the competition has already got stiffer with the launch of the LG Q6, which comes with many of the design aesthetics and features of the G6 at a lower price.

Micromax is the first Indian company to come with the phone with an aspect ratio of 18:9, but is it any good? We‚Äôve been using the phone much before the launch, and here‚Äôs our first impressions.

Micromax Canvas Infinity Design, Display

Even though the Canvas Infinity has a 5.7-inch screen, people with small hands will feel comfortable to handle the phone properly. This is because the Canvas Infinity has minimal bezels, and like LG and Samsung opted for a taller phone to accommodate the 18:9 aspect ratio.

Micromax Canvas Infinity‚Äôs back pops off to reveal a battery, two separate SIM slots, and a microSD slot. Micromax Canvas Infinity‚Äôs back pops off to reveal a battery, two separate SIM slots, and a microSD slot.

The metal frame surrounds the phone, with 2.5D curved glass dominating the front. The screen has rounded corners with a thin bezel over the top and bottom. Flip over and the Canvas Infinity reveals a single camera lens, a fingerprint scanner and the mono speaker. Unlike other unibody, metal clad devices, the Canvas Infinity‚Äôs back pops off to reveal a battery, two separate SIM slots and a microSD slot.

The Canvas Infinity is constructed out of metal, but the back is removable like the Moto G5. The bottom of the smartphone houses a USB 2.0 connector with the headphone jack located at the top of the phone.

Micromax Canvas Infinity‚Äôs display measures 5.7-inch size, and boasting a resolution of 1440 x 720p. Micromax Canvas Infinity‚Äôs display measures 5.7-inch size, and boasting a resolution of 1440 x 720p.

Canvas Infinity‚Äôs display measures 5.7-inch size, and boasting a resolution of 1440 x 720p. The screen is taller than the other phones with the same size, like we saw in case of the Galaxy S8. Although the phone‚Äôs resolution is on the lower side, details are sharp and viewing angles are good. But I found that there is a big problem with the video content that is not fit for an 18:9 aspect ratio.

When watching a video on YouTube, you get black bars on the sides of the video. At the moment, there‚Äôs a limited amount of 18:9 content online, but it will eventually grow with the acceptability of devices like the Canvas Infinity.

Micromax Canvas Infinity Processor, Software

Under the hood, the Canvas Infinity uses a Snapdragon 425 processor coupled with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal memory. There‚Äôs a room to expand the internal storage via a microSD card slot. In my short time spent with the Canvas Infinity, I was able to open web pages, load apps, and play games like Super Mario Run without the device stuttering. The overall performance of the Canvas Infinity was fine.

But yes, many will complaint about the choice of the processor used by the makers. Frankly that doesn‚Äôt matter, because this isn‚Äôt a handset projected to be the one to handle the most graphically-demanding games that we could find in the Play Store.

The overall performance of the Canvas Infinity, in the short time I had it, was fine. The overall performance of the Canvas Infinity, in the short time I had it, was fine.

Inside the Canvas Infinity is a 2,900mAh battery, which should get a full day without any issue. Since I have started using the phone, it‚Äôs hard to pass on the final verdict with limited testing.

Micromax Canvas Infinity comes loaded with the latest Android 7.1 Nougat and the user interface has been kept close to stock Android, which results in faster loading of apps. There are no pre-installed apps from third-party developers, with the exception of Narendra Modi app and basic default apps. The phone comes with some smart settings like One-handed mode, Smart Gestures, and Smart Action. You can also double-tap to wake the screen on the Canvas Infinity.

Micromax Canvas Infinity Camera

There‚Äôs a single 13-megapixel camera lens on the rear, and it has an f/2.0 aperture. While the initial results were fairly decent, I don‚Äôt really see the camera being a selling point of the device. The camera app launched quickly and snapped photos in seconds. Even though, the phone does not feature dual cameras on the back, it uses some software work to give you the option to blur the background while keeping the foreground subject in focus.

Camera sample from Micromax Canvas Infinity. (Image resized for web) Camera sample from Micromax Canvas Infinity. (Image resized for web)

The forward facing 16-megapixel camera is rather interesting. It took nice shots ‚Äì even in low light conditions. Like many smartphones, the Canvas Infinity too comes with a front facing flash. But there‚Äôs one feature that really shines. When you take a selfie in low light, the front facing camera detects the surroundings and automatically turns on. I was impressed by how precise the feature was during my testing. Plus, the selfie camera has a ‚Äúbokeh‚Äù mode that works reasonably well.

Micromax Canvas Infinity first impressions conclusion

There‚Äôs no denying that Micromax Canvas Infinity is the company‚Äôs biggest gamble till date. It features a design that no other Indian smartphone manufacturer has tried before. In fact, many of its key competitors like Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo are still repeating the same designs over and over again. Overall, Micromax has upped its game with the Canvas Infinity. Now, to see if this impresses the buyers.

Saina Nehwal: The Unbreakable,"Saina Nehwal will be an underdog but writing her off will be naive. (Source: File) Saina Nehwal will be an underdog but writing her off will be naive. (Source: File)

Saina Nehwal is still battling the effects of a debilitating knee injury and at 27 is the oldest among the Top-20 in the world. At the Glasgow World Championships, Indian badminton‚Äôs trailblazer will be an underdog but writing her off will be naive. Indian Express argues why Nehwal remains a force.

Saina Nehwal is about to embark on yet another round of beat ‚Äôem ups. Her buddy of many years, Parupalli Kashyap, is gloating he‚Äôs won every single turn of Mortal Kombat, whenever Saina drops by in Hyderabad and the group of friends hit the consoles at one of the guys‚Äô homes. It‚Äôs an unchanged routine ‚Äì a day before she flies out for tournaments from her home city, arriving from her training base Bangalore. No amount of losses have taken the edge off Saina‚Äôs fierce fervour to win this fighting game some day. On the eve of heading out to the World Championships, that competitive buzz is stinging the air again. ‚ÄúShe wants that ‚Äòchampion‚Äô thing now,‚Äù says Kashyap, though he isn‚Äôt talking of Mortal Kombat here. He meant in good ol‚Äô badminton.

Two years ago, the monkey was off her back ‚Äì Saina had ended a frustrating run of four quarterfinal losses at the World Championships, to clinch a silver behind Carolina Marin at Jakarta. Earlier in the season, she had medalled at the All England ‚Äì a silver again behind the Spaniard. ‚ÄúIf she had won those titles in 2015, it would‚Äôve been different. I don‚Äôt see her simply competing, saying I‚Äôve achieved all that I could. Probably, the burden of making the podium at the big events is off, but she badly wants those medals again. She wants the ‚Äòchampion‚Äô thing now,‚Äù Kashyap repeats. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs super-duper hungry for title wins.‚Äù

Saina is far away from the spotlight that will obsessively follow the largest Indian contingent at the World Championships at Glasgow starting Monday. Saina, at 27 the oldest amongst the world‚Äôs current Top 20, plays a sport that isn‚Äôt sympathetic to those with aging limbs and dimming reflexes. Modern badminton is a young woman‚Äôs sport, at the Worlds every shuttler in the Top 10 is below 25.

The Haryanvi from Hyderabad had hobbled off the Rio Olympics ‚Äì even as PV Sindhu stunningly and speedily took her spot on the pedestal. It‚Äôs the first agonising anniversary of the ACL trouble ‚Äì a neat, dispassionate acronym for her knee having chipped into two. Her recent results too haven‚Äôt been encouraging. A Tier 3 title in Malaysia and many fragmented failures have probably been worse for her confidence than those bodily bruises. There aren‚Äôt many who are expecting miracles from the World No 15 ‚Äì yes, the ranking‚Äôs spilled out of the hallowed Top 10 as well.

But because it‚Äôs Saina ‚Äì none‚Äôs writing her off either. Even the clinical skeptics ‚Äì who see waves and troughs coming from a mile, and suspect an imminent down-slide here based on her form and fitness ‚Äì paint pictures of enthusiastic epilogues to Saina‚Äôs career, and how it can‚Äôt be resurrected. Kashyap had no doubts though. ‚ÄúWhen she returned from surgery to play in Macau, China and Hong Kong, I knew she‚Äôs going to come back and told her we were happy she‚Äôs playing again,‚Äù Kashyap recalls the November of last year. Saina hadn‚Äôt been content though. ‚ÄúHer very first tournament ‚Äì she was hoping to win the title already!‚Äù

A one-act ‚Äòcomeback‚Äô script though doesn‚Äôt make for the most engaging drama. Even Saina‚Äôs sporting hero Roger Federer took five years to regain his Grand Slam winning prowess. 2017 has seen him pick two Slam titles. The year has also witnessed the return of Rafael Nadal to World No 1. Saina picked up a racquet in Hissar where she was called Steffi Saina as a child. She would turn a Federer faithful as soon as he‚Äôd won Wimbledon in 2003. It‚Äôs the Federer-Nadal narratives that the massive tennis fan will routinely dig into for inspiration, though opinion is divided over how she ought to go about her comeback.

Her inner circle believes she will amp up what she‚Äôs been doing these last few years with a tweak here and an upgrade there. And there are others who reckon it‚Äôs time for an overhaul. No one‚Äôs quite rushing to call time on her career though ‚Äì and the two F-words ‚Äì Federer and fighter, keep popping up in conversations, summing up Saina ahead of a World Championship, where she‚Äôs firmly an underdog.

At some point in their three-year-long journey as coach, Vimal found the right subject for small-talk with Saina. The two threadbared tennis and talked a lot about Federer, an athlete they both love. It was while watching Federer‚Äôs backhand slice having morphed into a whipping weapon, that Vimal had realised that Nehwal 2.0 was going to need similar tweaks. What had been a defensive shot was turned into an attacking kill. The Swiss legend, by driving through the backhand, would cut down on the rallies, thus putting less strain on his back and knee.

‚ÄúEarlier Federer used to mistime it, now he has winners under pressure on that backhand. Saina too needs to add variations to her strokes. It‚Äôs not so much of learning a new stroke, as shot-making from different positions,‚Äù Vimal says. In Australia, Saina‚Äôs last outing, she had been guilty of returning to mindless attacking as her fall-back mode, even when she had varied choices of shots at her disposal. The plan was to mix the deceptive clears with drops and smashes but she would keep switching to her favourite hyper-attacking template. The tactical bungle would be instrumental in denying her the chance to defend her title Down Under. ‚ÄúFrom Federer she can also learn how to remain focussed and wriggle out of tough situations. Her game is more like Nadal‚Äôs, but Federer is what we need to follow on picking which tournaments to play and when to take a break, and finally not get bogged down by rankings,‚Äù the coach adds.

Saina isn‚Äôt likely to jaunt off to Nilgiris like Federer went skiing in the Swiss Alps. However, the tennis legend‚Äôs shortened clay season and smart breaks are pointers that Saina‚Äôs team will riff off from. The fitness and intensity ‚Äì just enough ‚Äì that Federer maintained in those strategic breaks, is what legends across the world are attempting to figure out.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not always about working hard, but working smart. We were all saying Federer‚Äôs career is over, but look how he‚Äôs back,‚Äù says Heath Matthews who worked with Saina in the months post her surgery. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt prescribe heavy workloads to her because muscle tissues have to heal. Her travelling physio Aravind Nigam too has struck a balance where we push her to the absolute bare minimum to take her to 100 percent. Once she reaches that point, not one repetition extra,‚Äù he says. While shuttle legends Lee Chong Wei and Lin Dan will be closely watched to see if they can use the Roger code to stretch their careers upto Tokyo 2020, in women‚Äôs singles, Saina is the most likely to dip into the Federer formula.

The depths of her dark days will be consigned to history the moment Saina strikes a title, though those close to her are simply happy to see where she is a year after the Rio catastrophe. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt tell you how much it had hurt her,‚Äù Kashyap remembers, though he himself had realised three months before the Games that his own Olympics pursuit was over owing to a spate of injuries. ‚ÄúAt least I had time to make peace with what had happened and tell myself inane stuff like ‚Äòit‚Äôs not written for you.‚Äù In Saina‚Äôs case, two weeks before the Olympics, the pain started. It was horrible and she would cry on the days when it didn‚Äôt go down. Then she desperately took the cortisone injection and hoped that somehow the pain would subside.

‚ÄúHer pain threshold was crazy, because the doctor there was shocked and asked how the hell did she even step on court, when a piece of the bone was pricking her every second,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúShe expected till the last day that she would be able to play, but ..‚Äù Her leg had been in tumult. Lunging on the knee a 100 times a day in practice typically leads to a pull on the bone. The bone in self-preservation strengthens itself ‚Äì except in Saina‚Äôs case it grew more than it should have and literally chipped off inside the knee. ‚ÄúPeople casually said she was under pressure and she choked. It was a torrid time,‚Äù Kashyap recalls. Fitness levels in badminton have gone through the roof, matches are routinely 1 hour-long and the taxing schedule means no one‚Äôs immune to walking wounded on shuttle courts in women‚Äôs singles.

Saina was uncharacteristically not prone to injury in her first few years ‚Äì leading to 10 Super Series titles and medals at every major. The entire Chinese pack too was felled by injuries in Olympics year. Carolina Marin, Xuerui Li, Ratchanok have all faced injury troubles ‚Äì most others play with both knees strapped at all times. Nehwal had played the 2015 World Championship finals with a groin strain ‚Äì another painful episode, though Heath Matthews has never heard her reel off an excuse of injury after a loss.

‚ÄúFor a professional athlete, Olympics is the pinnacle and Saina had been World No 1 in between the two Games, and was looking forward to Rio. She tried to play through it, but it came as a big blow. But there‚Äôs nothing she loves more than badminton, and though her character has been tested this last one year and she‚Äôs lost close matches to players she can‚Äôt tangibly understand how, and kept her belief through a long rehab, there‚Äôs not a doubt that she‚Äôs on the cusp of a good year now,‚Äù Matthews says.

Some unconventional resistance work has gone into improving her speed, which will paper over the age-obstacle that‚Äôll get thrown at her often. ‚Äú27 is not old, and I‚Äôm not considering her age at all. She‚Äôs moving much better now, and we are going to take her speed to a level where she puts her younger opponents under time pressure,‚Äù he adds.

Saina somewhat specialised in rattling her opponents even when she first entered the circuit at 16 ‚Äì though her chosen weapon was power. It‚Äôs the speed that they plan to prop up now. Saina‚Äôs team is keen that she doesn‚Äôt alter her game drastically to compensate for her surgery, and she‚Äôs begun pushing her knee as confidence has returned to her lunging stride. While Vimal insists that her tactics and shot selection leave much to be desired ‚Äì the last year has indeed been a learning curve in dealing with the reality that it‚Äôs not easy to return and resume winning like before. With much grieving of losses, he insists that Saina realised she‚Äôs far away from getting to the top again, though the enjoyment she derived from court sessions remained undiminished.

Viren Rasquinha, whose OGQ have backed her all these years, was in Bangalore in Saina‚Äôs last week of training. Though he‚Äôs noticed the beginnings of an ability to switch on-switch off ‚Äì rare for the intense athlete who‚Äôs always had to be pulled back from over-training ‚Äì he was pleased with the familiar Saina sight. ‚ÄúAfter a 3-hour-long session, everyone was bending down exhausted, hands on hips. She walked up to Vimal Sir and asked ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äô‚Äù

One key reason why Saina‚Äôs team believes she‚Äôs still some time away from entirely reinventing her game is because she is yet to see the results of playing with 100 percent fitness. They reckon she‚Äôs been operating at 80 per cent, and once she hits the high notes, she‚Äôll be able to regain her lost form. Saina herself is believed to still feel the rush when she moves freely and when she can train without getting tired, though the losses have hurt.

‚ÄúIf you reach peak fitness and still the game‚Äôs not working for you, then we can start thinking of reinventing,‚Äù says a key member of her support staff. Saina needs to learn a couple of difficult don‚Äôts ‚Äì don‚Äôt worry about rankings, don‚Äôt peak for smaller tournaments. ‚ÄúSome people find it tough to hold back. But she‚Äôs smart enough to learn this eventually,‚Äù Kashyap says.

There‚Äôs a sneaking feeling amongst those detached from her immediate circle that she‚Äôs looking for luck, hoping something external conspires to make things work again. ‚ÄúShe needs a couple of changes to her team. What she‚Äôs doing isn‚Äôt working entirely. Even their best intention might not prove good enough,‚Äù says a former player, who adds that though motivation is never a problem with her, the small details are not in place to reach the top of the world again. Some others believe that the time is right for her to go easy on herself. ‚ÄúShe needs to chill a bit, tweak a few things, but stop comparing her to herself of some years ago,‚Äù says former international Aparna Popat.

‚ÄúShe has nothing to prove to anyone. Someone needs to tell her that nobody can take away what she‚Äôs achieved and she will always be considered the path-breaker. What we now want to see is Saina enjoying herself on court. She‚Äôs taken the burden for 10 years, now if she can play freely, she‚Äôll win much more,‚Äù she says. There‚Äôs those that believe that anything from now is a bonus and Saina will never be able to win solely on ‚Äòfitness‚Äô again, hence the need to revamp her game like Federer, and then there‚Äôs others who feel that urgency is important in addressing her fitness program, because it‚Äôs only going to get tougher from here. For every

Federer dream run, there‚Äôs the Usain Bolt stumble for those pushing their luck. There‚Äôs consensus that Saina doesn‚Äôt need to charge into all 12 Super Series with the intent of winning them all and should pace herself for the big titles. No one spoken to for this story, expressed a single doubt that Saina ever lacks in commitment when in training or in a match. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy for all of us to tell her. But Saina hates losing and wants to play well at all times. I dont want to change that mentality. Though I don‚Äôt want her to have major ambitions for the next 6 months, she should know she can win titles and beat anybody,‚Äù Vimal says. Some combats are set up for sporting immortals.

Sweet shops down shutters as part of day-long strike to protest 5 per cent GST,"A shut K C Das at Esplanade in Kolkata on Monday. (Express photo by Partha Paul) A shut K C Das at Esplanade in Kolkata on Monday. (Express photo by Partha Paul)

Lakhs of sweet shops across the state remained shut on Monday, following a 24-hour strike called by Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsayee Samiti, demanding the rollback of the 5 per cent Goods and Service Tax (GST) on sweets. ‚ÄúWe have received immense response from sweet sellers across the state. Almost all sweet shops downed their shutters. We do not have the infrastructure to cope up with the new tax regime. Government kept paneer and other perishable items out of GST but imposed 5 per cent GST on sweets,‚Äù said Jagannath Ghosh, the Joint Secretary of Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsayee Samiti, Kolkata unit.

‚ÄúIt is not possible for sweet sellers to file so many returns. They (Centre) have kept two schemes for us. In one scheme, tax return has to be filed quarterly, and in another we need to file tax return 38 times in one year. We want the government to rollback its decision and keep sweets industry out of GST,‚Äù said Ghosh.

According to sweet sellers, the sweets industry registers over Rs 1,000 crore turnover annually, and has about 10 lakh employees. In one day‚Äôs strike, the industry would incur a loss of Rs 10 lakh, they said. According to Ghosh, sweet sellers also plan to intensify their protest and sit for a relay hunger strike from August 24 to September 26.

‚ÄúWe have paid VAT on raw materials, but there has been no tax on sweets, and we want the government to understand the core matters of our industry. Those who sell sweets are not computer-friendly, and it is a headache for them to file tax returns. Is it possible to give a printed bill to each customer for one rosogulla or one sandesh?‚Äù asked a sweet seller.

GST on sweets will also increase cost of the product, which will be an extra burden for customers. ‚ÄúHere in Bengal, we don‚Äôt need occasions to buy sweets. Having sweets is like a daily affair for us. An increase in its cost will definitely affect us,‚Äù said Rita Bhattacharya, a housewife. Most of the sweet shops in the state don‚Äôt issue bills to their customers. They sell sweets and pay VAT on raw materials. There has been no tax on sweets for many years. ‚ÄúWith GST, we have to keep track of number of items sold and issue bills, for which we need a computer and someone to operate it. The infrastructure we require to pay GST is costly,‚Äù added Ram Babu, a sweet shop owner at VIP Road who has been running his shop for the last 20 years.

"Red ball or pink, West Indies plumb to new depths","West Indies are yet to win a Test match in England since 2000. (Source: Reuters) West Indies are yet to win a Test match in England since 2000. (Source: Reuters)

It was an all too familiar story that played out at Edgbaston in the first ever day/night Test in England. West Indies lost 19 wickets in a day to lose by an innings, batting for a combined duration of six and a half hours. But the most damning fact is that this sort of capitulation was not entirely unexpected. The West Indies have been lurching from one disaster to the next for a long time. They drew with England in their last series, in the Caribbean in April-May 2015, but it has been mostly downhill ever since.

Diminishing returns

West Indies have won just two Tests in their last 18, losing 13 of those games. Clearly, while they are not winning, they don‚Äôt even seem to have the ability to hold on for a draw. Recently, their No.11 batsman Shannon Gabriel got out playing a big shot when only one over remained to be negotiated to ensure a drawn series against Pakistan.

Minus 200

In eight of their Tests over this period, the West Indies have conceded a lead of over 200 on first innings, showing the gulf of class between them and most of the other teams. They have managed to be in front on first innings in only one match out of their last 18.

Too few 5-wicket hauls

Bowlers win matches. The likes of Shannon Gabriel, Devendra Bishoo, Jason Holder and Miguel Cummins have impressed with the ball off and on, but they have not done it consistently enough or as a unit to have the desired impact. The West Indians have had 9 five-wicket hauls in the last 18 Tests, but they have translated into only two victories. Opposition bowlers have had 14 of them in the same period.

Centurions of wrong kind

Test cricket is a battle of attrition, with quality batsmen forcing opposition bowlers to a hard graft, forcing them to bowl a lot of overs and conceding a lot of runs. West Indies bowlers have conceded over a 100 runs in an innings as many as 20 times in the last 18 Tests, while their own batsmen have forced opposition bowlers to do so on just six occasions.

Different fortunes in T20

While their Test team flounders, the West Indies are an irresistible force in Twenty20 cricket. They have won two of the last three World Cups in the shortest format, in which their most famous stars join hands. They have a successful Caribbean Premier League which attracts a lot of spectators while the Test team plays in front of sparse crowds as nobody wants to pay to see their team lurch from one seemingly inevitable defeat to another.

Speaking of disaster

‚ÄúThis lot are the worst Test team I have seen in more than 50 years of watching, playing and commentating on cricket. They can‚Äôt bat, can‚Äôt bowl. I take no pleasure out of saying this as I played against some of the greatest players the world has ever seen wearing the maroon cap of the West Indies.‚Äù

‚Äì Geoffrey Boycott

‚ÄúI talked with Sir Viv Richards and Sir Andy Roberts before and during the Test about how we used to dominate world cricket, about pride and passion. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs lacking. People feel sad for us and that‚Äôs just not right.‚Äù

‚Äì Curtly Ambrose

6 ‚Äì Number of centuries West Indian batsmen have scored since their home series against England more than two years ago. Of these three have been by Roston Chase. In stark contrast, opposition batsmen have feasted on their mediocre bowling, helping themselves to 22 hundreds in the last 18 Tests.

Neymar targets improvement after phenomenal home debut,"The result moved PSG to the top of the table on goal difference, with champions Monaco. (Source: AP) The result moved PSG to the top of the table on goal difference, with champions Monaco. (Source: AP)

Neymar said he was already feeling at home at Paris St Germain after scoring twice in a dazzling display in his second match for the French club following his record transfer from Barcelona.

In addition to his two goals in his first match at Parc des Princes, Neymar set up two more and won a penalty as 10-man PSG trounced Toulouse 6-2 to go top of Ligue 1 on Sunday.

‚ÄúI already feel at home here,‚Äù he told local media. ‚ÄúThe team plays in the Brazilian style and this helps my integration. ‚ÄúI love the atmosphere of the Parc des Princes. The fans supported us until the last minute. They made a lot of noise.

‚ÄúNow I want to adapt quicker‚Ä¶ I think I can improve.‚Äù Neymar, who moved from Barcelona for 222 million euros ($260.61 million) earlier this month, has now scored three goals in two matches for his new club after opening his account on debut against Guingamp last week.

The 25-year-old left his best until last on Sunday, showing brilliant control, and benefiting from a bit of luck, as he danced around five defenders before planting the ball in the back of the net in stoppage time.

‚ÄúI do not really remember what happened on my second goal, the most important thing is that it went into the back of the net,‚Äù he said.

Toulouse striker Andy Delort, whose foul on the Brazilian led to the penalty converted by Edinson Cavani, compared Neymar‚Äôs skills to those of another Brazilian who made his mark at Barcelona and PSG.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a phenomenon, an artist,‚Äù he told L‚ÄôEquipe. ‚ÄúIt was like Ronaldinho, we never knew what to expect when he got the ball. I do not know if there‚Äôs a way to stop him.

‚ÄúThe only positive thing is that we have only have to face him once more in the championship.‚Äù

The result moved PSG to the top of the table on goal difference, with champions Monaco and Saint-Etienne also maintaining their 100 percent records with three wins each.

PSG, last year‚Äôs runners-up, host Saint-Etienne next weekend in their fourth match of the season.

"Junior cricketing structure in India is probably the best in the world, says WV Raman","WV Raman has praised the Indian u-19 side for its commendable performances. (Source: Express Photo) WV Raman has praised the Indian u-19 side for its commendable performances. (Source: Express Photo)

The Indian U-19 side has put in a string of good performances over the past year. In the recently concluded series against England, India dominated their opposition to register a clean sweep. Comparing the Indian side with its counterparts, WV Raman, who was the India coach in the youth series, stated that the team is way ahead.

While speaking to TOI, Raman said, ‚ÄúThe junior cricketing structure in India is probably the best in the world. It also includes the Under-16 category. These boys get to play numerous matches and that too at very good venues. They are well supported by the system.Thus, these players are definitely at an advantage as compared to the boys in the same age group from other countries.‚Äù.

‚ÄúMost of them start playing for the state Under-16 or zonal sides. Their skills are developed in the off-season camps.They not only gain experience playing a lot of matches but these camps help them repeat their skills more often and gain proficiency. That‚Äôs why these boys are far superior to those from the other countries,‚Äù he added.

Singling out Prithvi Shaw and applauding him for his efforts, Raman said, ‚ÄúPrithvi is fearless, dominating and confident. He has a special ability to get runs quickly. In another two years, he will find out a way on how to be aggressive consistently for long periods.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe heartening thing is it wasn‚Äôt just about a couple of individual performances. Our bowlers chipped in with the bat under pressure, guys who flew in for the ODIs hit the mark straight away under pressure moments. That was the highlight of the tour for me,‚Äù he concluded.

"Ahead of verdict, officials meet Dera representatives","Rapid Action Force personnel at district court in Panchkula Monday. (Jaipal Singh) Rapid Action Force personnel at district court in Panchkula Monday. (Jaipal Singh)

DAYS AHEAD of the verdict in a rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, deputy commissioners and SSPs held meetings with representatives of the Dera and officials of various departments across the state on Monday. Representatives from BSF, Armed Battalion, Rapid Action Force, Punjab Commandos and CRPF also took part in the meetings. Besides, a flag march is also being conducted in all the districts.

Security has already been stepped up near Naam Charcha Ghar of the Dera across the state and the district administrations, SSPs have appealed to the people on Monday to maintain peace and not to fall prey to rumours. Malwa Punjab has a large base of Dera followers and there are over 500 deras of the Sacha Sauda in the state out of which a majority are in Malwa region only. In Muktsar, DC Sumit Jarangal and SSP Sushil Kumar had called a meeting with the local representatives of the Dera in which Rajesh Kumar, Sunil Kumar, Harji Ram, Amarjit Singh and few others from Malaut and Lambi blocks of the Dera took part. ‚ÄúThe Dera representatives have assured us of maintaining peace and stated that one should be aware of antisocial elements,‚Äù said Jarangal.

Meanwhile, Ram Singh, member of the political arm of the Dera Sacha Sauda, told The Indian Express, ‚ÄúWe have got no instructions from the Dera and hence we are organising our regular satsangs at Nam Charcha ghars across the state. These are our regular features.‚Äù Moreover, Naam Charcha Ghars are observing August as the month to celebrate the birthday of the Dera chief.

At the meeting in Sangrur, representatives of BSF, CRPF, Punjab commandos, etc, also took part, said SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu. Meetings also took place in Fazilka, Ferozepur and Bathinda as well. Officials even visited the local deras. Police and district administrations have asked people not to post anything provocative on social media and that no one should try to hurt the sentiments of other religions.

The verdict on the Dera head‚Äôs case will be declared on August 25 and it has been learnt that the Dera followers have already started gathering in Panchkula and Sirsa. The Dera head is to appear in court in person on August 25. However, it is all quiet at Salabatpura, the largest Naam Charcha Ghar of the Dera after Sirsa, and all other Naam Charcha Ghars, though followers these days are meeting for daily satsangs and even holding them at home as well.

PV Sindhu, who will lead India‚Äôs challenge at Badminton World Championships, said she is determined to change the colour of her previous two bronze medals.

‚ÄúI think it has been two months since Australia Open, so I got enough time to practice. Form wise, I am perfectly all right, so I hope I give my best and do well,‚Äù Rio 2016 Olympics silver medallist Sindhu told reporters in Glasgow.

‚ÄúI am definitely looking for a medal here and hopefully, better one than bronze this time, I also want to change the colour, so will fight for that,‚Äù added the 22-year-old.

Much before her medal at Rio 2016 Olympics and triumphs at China Open and 2017 India Open, Sindhu grabbed the limelight for her bronze medals at 2013 and 2014 editions of the World Championships. After getting a bye in the opening round, she will either face Korea‚Äôs Kim Hyo Min or Egypt‚Äôs Hadia Hosny in the second round.

Sindhu lost to Spain‚Äôs Carolina Marin in the Rio final but had her revenge when the Indian beat her in the Indian Open final earlier this year.

‚ÄúIt was important for me to win the India Open. It was good to win in front of the home crowd ‚Äì there were a lot of people in India who couldn‚Äôt make it to Rio and were excited to be there,‚Äù said Sindhu.

‚ÄòDelhi is no longer about any one kind of food‚Äô: Sadia Dehlvi,"‚ÄúMy earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta,‚Äù Sadia Dehlvi says. ‚ÄúMy earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta,‚Äù Sadia Dehlvi says.

Through the streets of Shahajahanabad, into the kitchen of some of the oldest families of Delhi, Sadia Dehlvi looks at the shape-shifter of a city that Delhi has come to be in her recent book Jasmine and Jinns. She talks of growing up in an extended Dilli family that lived in Shama Kothi on Sardar Patel Marg, the changes in the city‚Äôs palate over the years and giving Delhi one of its culinary stars ‚Äì Al Kauser. Excerpts:

In the book, you trace your childhood through seasons and recipes telling us about a Delhi that once was. How did you narrow down on the idea?

Delhi has distinct seasons, and once upon a time lifestyles revolved around the weather. I would hear stories of how shopkeepers pulled down their shutters when the first rains arrived and went to Mehrauli for picnics with their families. Special dishes were made in the monsoon like Harimirch Qeema, Besani Roti and fresh Mango Chutney. Nihari was always associated with winter, and was eaten nihar muh, that is on an empty stomach. In winters, at home, every Sunday was ‚Äònihari day.‚Äô We had it as early breakfast. Now people eat nihari all through the year and usually for lunch or dinner. It was traditionally referred to as gharib aadmi ka khana, and never served at weddings. Now nihari is a part of festive cuisine, even for us Dilliwalas.

In the summer, very little spice was used and I remember a variety of sherbets being made at home. These were mixed with barley water to keep us hydrated. Special chutneys were made with raw mango to save us from the severe heat. People in Delhi are exceedingly particular about taseer ‚Äî inherent food properties and their effects on the body. I grew up relating to food in terms of halka (light), bhaari (heavy), garam (warm), or thanda (cold). Spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and peppercorns are believed to have garam taseer, and dishes which have these as ingredients are cooked mostly in winter. There is a hidden wisdom in such beliefs.

What are your first and most enduring memories of food?

My earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta. In those days, ready to use spices were not used in most homes. When large parties were held at home, I recall professional cooks coming to the house, cooking in deghs with the meat and spices provided to them. Tandoors were dug in the house for fresh rotis. There was a separate area in the house of kuchi mitti for this kind of cooking. My grandfather was a gracious host, and Shama Kothi acquired the reputation of serving the city‚Äôs finest cuisine.

How did you choose the recipes for the book?

Most of these dishes are cooked in my home and in the kitchens of most Dilliwalas. Except for recipes of a few specialties cooked on festivals and weddings, the rest of the dishes are really a part of our day to day cooking. One does not require some exotic spices to make them. And since our food is dominated by seasons, that‚Äôs how I have divided the food sections. We usually cook almost all seasonal vegetables with meat. It‚Äôs not just a good way to balance the intake of meat and vegetables, but also to create a variety of wonderful dishes.

Shami Kebabs Shami Kebabs

You mention how Delhi‚Äôs palate changed with the arrival of the Mughals and then with the British. What are the changes you notice in Delhi‚Äôs food culture today?

The Mughal cuisine, that is Indo Persian, is probably the cuisine that best defines Delhi‚Äôs traditional non-vegetarian cuisine. Chillies were added to Delhi food in the 18th century on the advise of the city‚Äôs hakims after the water in the canal that ran through Chandni Chowk got polluted. It was a way to purge toxins from the body. This is what led to the creation of Delhi‚Äôs popular chaat. Delhi‚Äôs cuisine once comprised Jain, Bania and Muslim food. Then the British influenced the eating habits of the elite. More changes came after Partition, with the arrival of the Punjabis. Tandoori chicken, butter chicken, choley bhaturey and dal makhani, came to typify Delhi food. But even that has changed, Delhi is no longer about any one kind of food. People from all over the country have made Delhi their home. So it‚Äôs now as much about dosa, momos, noodles as it is about biryani and qorma.

In the book, you mention how your mother wasn‚Äôt interested in kitchen chores. How do you think women‚Äôs relationship with food has changed?

My mother resented kitchen chores, because in those days women‚Äôs lives seemed to revolve around cooking. She rebelled against that idea and, luckily, she never really had to cook. She did other things and didn‚Äôt encourage me to cook either. Even now, she can‚Äôt understand my obsession with cooking. She tells me not to waste too much time in the kitchen. With so many women working, I think now cooking is not really looked at in a regressive way. Young working couples seem to order in or eat out so often. More and more young people are into health, and one has to cook right to eat right. With the internet, world cuisine has opened up and I meet so many young women who are experimenting with cooking various types of food. If you don‚Äôt look at cooking as a boring chore, it can be so much fun.

Family recipes were not shared earlier. But you believe in sharing them.

In older days, women or professional cooks never shared recipes. If they did, they would leave out a main ingredient so one could never get it right. I share family recipes because it gladdens my heart that they‚Äôll bring cheer to people‚Äôs tables. Many of these have never travelled out of traditional Dilli homes. When friends come home for meals, they are surprised at the unusual combinations such as karela qeema, gajar salan, chuqandar gosht, bhindi salan that are regular fare for us.

How did Al Kauser come about?

I began Al Kauser with my mother in 1979. It was a small kiosk just opposite our house. After having lived a year in New York, I was very taken with the idea of street food. In those days, Delhi just had five star hotels and a few good restaurants, mostly in Connaught Place. Other than these, one had to go to old Delhi to eat kebabs. Al Kauser was the first road side kebab shop in New Delhi. It became quite a rage in the ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s. The kitchen was in our house. Entertaining in those years became so easy, as I could literally order a plate of kebab from my room. Now, street food is so much a part of Delhi culture.

Tell us the story behind the book‚Äôs title and the cover design.

Jasmine is the fragrance from my childhood. It was my grandmother‚Äôs favourite flower. We had jasmine shrubs in our gardens and I would help amma pluck them. In the summer, when we slept on the terrace, these were put on the charpais of the elders. The girls of the house were not allowed to wear jasmine flowers because amma said that jinns were attracted to young girls who wore jasmine. I also believe we had jinns that lived with us. In the evening, just before sunset, we had to stop playing in the gardens as amma said it was the time jinns ventured out. Throughout the 50 years we lived at Shama Kothi, we heard strange noises every night. So I guess my childhood was about Jasmine and Jinns. The cover idea by Shaaz Ahmed is old style story telling, with various elements from my childhood.

US and South Korean troops start drills amid North Korea standoff,"A US Air Force U-2 spy plane takes off on the runway at the Osan US Air Base in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, Monday, August 21, 2017. (Source: AP) A US Air Force U-2 spy plane takes off on the runway at the Osan US Air Base in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, Monday, August 21, 2017. (Source: AP)

US and South Korean troops kicked off their annual drills on Monday that come after President Donald Trump and North Korea exchanged warlike rhetoric in the wake of the North‚Äôs two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month. The Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills are largely computer-simulated war games held every summer and have drawn furious responses from North Korea, which views them as an invasion rehearsal.

Pyongyang‚Äôs state media yesterday called this year‚Äôs drills a ‚Äúreckless‚Äù move that could trigger the ‚Äúuncontrollable phase of a nuclear war.‚Äù Despite the threat, US and South Korean militaries launched this year‚Äôs 11-day training today morning as scheduled.

The exercise involves 17,500 American troops and 50,000 South Korean soldiers, according to the US military command in South Korea and Seoul‚Äôs Defense Ministry. No field training like live-fire exercises or tank maneuvering is involved in the Ulchi drills, in which alliance officers sit at computers to practice how they engage in battles and hone their decision-making capabilities. The allies have said the drills are defensive in nature.

South Korea‚Äôs President Moon Jae-in said Monday that North Korea must not use the drills as a pretext to launch fresh provocation, saying the training is held regularly because of repeated provocations by North Korea.

North Korea typically responds to South Korea-US military exercises with weapons tests and a string of belligerent rhetoric. During last year‚Äôs Ulchi drills, North Korea test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile that flew about 500 kilometers (310 miles) in the longest flight by that type of weapon. Days after the drills, the North carried out its fifth and biggest nuclear test to date.

Last month North Korea test-launched two ICBMs at highly lofted angles, and outside experts say those missiles can reach some US parts like Alaska, Los Angeles or Chicago if fired at normal, flattened trajectories. Analysts say it would be only a matter of time for the North to achieve its long-stated goal of acquiring a nuclear missile that can strike anywhere in the United States.

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump pledged to answer North Korean aggression with ‚Äúfire and fury.‚Äù North Korea, for its part, threatened to launch missiles toward the American territory of Guam before its leader Kim Jong Un backed off saying he would first watch how Washington acts before going ahead with the missile launch plans.

Boko Haram use of kids as ‚Äòhuman bombs‚Äô soars in 2017: UN,"The UN estimates the insurgency has displaced 1.7 million people and left an estimated 20,000 people dead since 2009. The UN estimates the insurgency has displaced 1.7 million people and left an estimated 20,000 people dead since 2009.

UNICEF is reporting a fourfold increase in the use of children as ‚Äúhuman bombs‚Äù by the radical Boko Haram group in northeastern Nigeria already this year compared to all of 2016. UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado says she has no explanation for the increase in 83 such ‚Äúhuman bomb‚Äù children, two-thirds of them girls, compared to 19 total children last year.

She said Boko Haram does not always claim responsibility for such attacks typically against civilian targets, but no other groups are known to use the tactic. A side-effect is that ‚Äúmany children who have managed to get away from captivity face rejection when they try to reintegrate into their communities.‚Äù

The UN estimates the insurgency has displaced 1.7 million people and left an estimated 20,000 people dead since 2009.

Boston march against hate speech avoids Charlottesville chaos,"Counter protesters clash with Boston Police outside of the Boston Commons and the Boston Free Speech Rally in Boston. (Source: Reuters) Counter protesters clash with Boston Police outside of the Boston Commons and the Boston Free Speech Rally in Boston. (Source: Reuters)

Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Boston on Saturday to protest a ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù rally featuring far-right speakers a week after a woman was killed at a Virginia white-supremacist demonstration. Rally organizers had invited several far-right speakers who were confined to a small pen that police set up in the historic Boston Common park to keep the two sides separate. The city avoided a repeat of last weekend‚Äôs bloody street battles in Charlottesville, Virginia, where one woman was killed.

Police estimated that as many as 40,000 people packed into the streets around the nation‚Äôs oldest park. Officials had spent a week planning security for the event, mobilizing 500 police officers, including many on bikes, and placing barricades and large white dump trucks on streets along the park, aiming to deter car-based attacks like those seen in Charlottesville and Europe. The rally never numbered more than a few dozen people, and its speakers could not be heard due to the shouts of those protesting it and the wide security cordon between the two sides. It wrapped up about an hour earlier than planned.

Protesters surrounded people leaving the rally, shouting ‚Äúshame‚Äù and ‚Äúgo home‚Äù and occasionally throwing plastic water bottles. Police escorted several rally participants through the crowds, sometimes struggling against protesters who tried to stop them. Some people dressed in black with covered faces several times swarmed rally attendees, including two men wearing the ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù caps from President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign.

The violence in Charlottesville triggered the biggest domestic crisis yet for Trump, who provoked ire across the political spectrum for not immediately condemning white nationalists and for praising ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù on both sides of the fight. On Saturday, Trump on Twitter praised the Boston protesters. ‚ÄúI want to applaud the many protestors in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate. Our country will soon come together as one!‚Äù Trump tweeted. ‚ÄúOur great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heal, & we will heal, & be stronger than ever before!‚Äù

ARRESTS, TENSIONS

Thirty-three people were arrested, largely for scuffles in which some protesters threw rocks and bottles of urine at police dressed in riot gear, the Boston Police Department said. ‚ÄúThere was a little bit of a confrontation,‚Äù Police Commissioner William Evans told reporters, adding that ‚Äú99.9 percent of the people who were here were here for the right reasons.‚Äù Several protesters said they were unsurprised that the ‚ÄúFree Speech‚Äù event broke up early. ‚ÄúThey heard our message loud and clear: Boston will not tolerate hate,‚Äù said Owen Toney, a 58-year-old community activist who attended the anti-racism protest. ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôll think again about coming here.‚Äù

US tensions over hate speech have ratcheted up sharply after the Charlottesville clashes during the latest in a series of white supremacist marches.

White nationalists had converged in the Southern university city to defend a statue of Robert E. Lee, who led the pro-slavery Confederacy‚Äôs army during the Civil War, which ended in 1865. A growing number of U.S. political leaders have called for the removal of statues honoring the Confederacy, with civil rights activists charging that they promote racism. Advocates of the statues contend they are a reminder of their heritage.

Organizers of Saturday‚Äôs rally in Boston denounced the white supremacist message and violence of Charlottesville and said their event would be peaceful.

Republican US Senate candidate Shiva Ayyadurai spoke at the rally, surrounded by supporters holding ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù signs. ‚ÄúWe have a full spectrum of people here,‚Äù Ayyadurai said in a video of his speech posted on Twitter. ‚ÄúWe have people from the Green Party here, we have Bernie (Sanders) supporters here, we‚Äôve got people who believe in nationalism.‚Äù Protesters also began gathering on Saturday evening in Texas, with the Houston chapter of Black Lives Matter holding a rally to remove a ‚ÄúSpirit of the Confederacy‚Äù monument from a park. In Dallas, where a Lee statue was vandalized overnight, about 1,000 people gathered near City Hall to demonstrate against white supremacy.

A man who appeared waving a Confederate flag was quickly surrounded by at least 100 demonstrators. ‚ÄúShame on you,‚Äù they chanted. Police officers escorted the man out of the plaza a few minutes later as the crowd cheered. While Boston has a reputation as one of the nation‚Äôs most liberal cities, it also has a history of racist outbursts, most notably riots against the desegregation of schools in the 1970s. Karla Venegas, a 22-year-old who recently moved to Boston from California, said she was not surprised that the Free Speech rally petered out so quickly. ‚ÄúThey were probably scared away by the large crowd,‚Äù Venegas said.

Demolition drive: Displaced Vadodara families restart stir,"Protest outside VMC office. Bhupendra Rana Protest outside VMC office. Bhupendra Rana

Close to 550 families, displaced in a November 2014 demolition drive undertaken by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation, restarted their agitation against the civic body on Friday, almost six months after the construction of their in-situ rehabilitation project was discontinued following the VMC ‚Äòexhausting‚Äô its funds.

The families, mostly Muslims, rejected the proposal of alternate relocation to Tandalja since they do not want to be ‚Äúghettoized‚Äù. The VMC said that it has discontinued the rental compensation as the families have the option of accepting the new homes.

The families marched in a protest rally to VMC headquarters, holding placards with questions like ‚ÄúWhy is the VMC turning back on its promise?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy should poor beneficiary families suffer the corruption of the VMC?‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWe want our homes‚Äù.

Led by Professor JS Bandukwala, Congress corporator Farid Cutpiece and other representatives, the residents submitted a memorandum to VMC Commissioner Vinod Rao, stating that VMC had breached its promise of relocating the families in Kalyannagar.

The memorandum said, ‚ÄúThe corporation says that it cannot go ahead with construction because it has run out of funds. The fact is that they had appointed a consultant for the project, CEPT. Later, it changed the consultant to WAPCOS, which said that the project cost would rise. VMC went ahead with the project aware of the rise in cost. Now, it has abandoned the project saying it is out of funds.‚Äù

Rao said that disbursement of the monthly rental was stopped as the families were offered homes in Tandalja. Speaking of the deadlock, he said, ‚ÄúThere are many people who want to shift to Tandalja. And there are many who have refused.‚Äù

He said, ‚ÄúThere is no need to send proposals to the Standing Committee for change of this allotment as it is within the powers of the Commissioner to do so. We are hopeful that in the days to come, through talks the families will accept the offer as it is in their best interest.‚Äù

A representative of the agitating families said, ‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is that the VMC has deliberately stalled the in-situ rehabilitation as the current land of Kalyannagar is now a prime property. We have also learnt that just like Sayajipura and Kalali in 2015, the VMC is facing pressure from a lobby to shift Muslims out of this developing area. Therefore, the VMC has stopped the construction and also the rental disbursement to build pressure on these poor families to resign to their fate and shift to the Muslim ghetto of Tandalja. The VMC is aware that the poor families will not be able to pull an agitation without rental compensations as they have been paying heavy fees for their makeshift homes since they were displaced.‚Äù

Raise issues of national interest while in India: KP Sharma Oli to Sher Bahadur Deuba,"KP Sharma Oli. (Reuters photo) KP Sharma Oli. (Reuters photo)

Main opposition leader KP Sharma Oli urged Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to discuss the issues of Nepal‚Äôs national interest during his India visit, including the problem of floods in border areas, energy development and the 1950 bilateral treaty. Deuba, who took over from Prachanda as the prime minister of Nepal in a power-sharing deal in June, will be on a five- day visit to India from tomorrow on his first official trip abroad.

Oli, the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal-Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), underlined the need for Deuba to inform the people about the reasons behind his visit to India at a time when the House session was underway. Addressing the addressing the parliament, Oli said Nepal has been badly hit by floods and landslides, which have killed nearly 150 people and rendered another 10,000 homeless.

‚ÄúAt this moment, extensive talks and discussions about the matters should be held with the neighbour during the visit so as to seek permanent solutions to frequent problems of floods caused by border rivers in the Terai region,‚Äù he said. He said the bilateral energy policy unveiled by India recently was not in Nepal‚Äôs interest and ‚Äúwould contribute nothing‚Äù to promote the Himalayan country‚Äôs energy sector.

He said Nepal as the current chair of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation should play an important role to de-escalate geopolitical and other regional tensions. Oli also asked Deuba to discuss the 1950 Peace and Friendship Treaty with India. The treaty establishing a close strategic bilateral relationship has often been criticised by some political parties here as being skewed in India‚Äôs favour.

On the demands by Madhesi people for a Constitution amendment to give more political powers the community, Oli said his party could have supported it had the proposal come through an ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù channel and was based on consensus. Nepal‚Äôs parliament yesterday failed to pass the Constitution amendment bill, aimed at addressing the two main demands of the Madhesi people ‚Äì more representation in the Parliament and redrawing of provincial boundaries.

Madhesis, mostly of Indian-origin, launched a prolonged agitation between September 2015 and February last year against the implementation of the new Constitution which they felt marginalised the Terai community.

"Disha Patani, Esha Gupta, Malaika Arora, et al add Bollywood bling to LFW ramp","There's no denying that the stellar designer collections are what the Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 are all about, but the Bollywood showstoppers had that additional bling - a cherry on top, if you please.

It's kind of unusual to mix a corset top, shorts and a sheer dress together to create an outfit, but it's ace designer Ritu Kumar we are talking about. We thinks she pulled it off beautifully. The stylists did a brilliant job too by giving Patani lovely tousled hair and sun-kissed make-up. (Source: Express photo by Amit Chakravarty)

"Raksha Bandhan 2017: Know the Importance, History and Significance of Raksha Bandhan Festival in India","There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother‚Äôs wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia) There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother‚Äôs wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia)

India as we know has a rich cultural heritage and while there are many festivals observed throughout the year, Raksha Bandhan holds a special place. It is the time when siblings celebrate the special bond of love between them. Sisters tie a thread/band around their brother‚Äôs wrist for his long life and happiness and in exchange he promises to protect his sibling from all evils. This year, Raksha Bandhan will be observed on August 7.

Origin of Raksha Bandhan

The exact origin of the festival that is celebrated joyously in India and Nepal is unknown, but there are are many interesting stories associated with it. The most popular one is from the Mahabharata and it acknowledges the relationship between Lord Krishna and Draupadi. According to the epic, one morning, when Lord Krishna was flying a kite, he cut his finger on the abrasive string. Draupadi, who was nearby, saw him bleeding profusely and ran to him. She then tore a piece from her sari and tied it around his finger. Lord Krishna was so touched that in return he promised to protect her from all evil, forever. And he did protect her all along, especially during her ‚Äòcheerharan‚Äô by the Kauravas.

There‚Äôs another interesting story involving Emperor Humayun and Rani Karnavati of Mewar. When Mewar was attacked twice by Bahadur Shah Zafar in the mid 16th century, she sent a letter with a rakhi to Humayun as a last resort, to help her. The emperor was so touched by the gesture that he immediately left the military campaign he was then involved in to protect her.

Interesting rituals

There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother‚Äôs wrist. In some parts of India, families draw figures and symbols on the walls of their homes and worship them with offerings of vermilion and kheer. Palm imprints are also used to decorate the entrance of a household where rakhis are stuck.

In the penultimate match of the evening, WWE Champion Jinder Mahal defeated Shinsuke Nakamura to retain the gold and continue his reign as the Maharaja. But once again it was the Singh brothers who made a timely intervention to help Jinder wave of a strong challenge by Nakamura.

It is a medium to serve the society and country,‚Äù said Mahajan, who has been representing the Indore Lok Sabha seat continuously since 1989.

Last week, BJP president Amit Shah had stated during his Madhya Pradesh visit that there was no rule or tradition in his party that those above 75 do not get a post or election ticket. ‚ÄúThere is a need to change the outlook towards politics. It is not a medium to serve personal agenda, it is a medium to serve the society and country,‚Äù Mahajan said, speaking to reporters in Indore.

‚ÄúAge is irrelevant if the person is mentally and physically fit,‚Äù she said. When asked if she would stand for election in 2019, Mahajan said she was working with full vigour to serve people and working more than an ordinary MP. However, she clarified that she could not say how her physical condition would be after two years. ‚ÄúI will decide after two years whether I would be able to remain active (as a politician) as per the voters‚Äô expectations,‚Äù she said.

Rob Quiney announces retirement,"Rob Quiney has played a couple of Tests for the national side Rob Quiney has played a couple of Tests for the national side

Veteran Australian batsman, Rob Quiney has announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. This was after he was not handed an extension of his contract for the upcoming season. It may be recalled here that Quiney has played a couple of Tests for the national side and made his debut in 2007.

Confirming his retirement, Shaun Graf, Cricket Victoria‚Äôs general manager of cricket, said, ‚ÄúRob Quiney has been a tremendous figure in Victorian cricket throughout his highly decorated career. He embodies all of Victoria‚Äôs values and it‚Äôs a testament to his skill and character that he‚Äôs been able to achieve so much success as a player, particularly playing in our five most recent Sheffield Shield titles including the three-peat.‚Äù

Although we‚Äôve lost some senior experience for this season, we‚Äôre fortunate to have a number of our younger players having gained valuable experience over the last two years and they know what it takes to be successful at first-class level,‚Äù Graf said and added, ‚ÄúAdd young stars Will Pucovski and Will Sutherland to that mix and it‚Äôs an exciting time for Victorian cricket ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to think of a time when we‚Äôve been in a stronger, more successful position in the state‚Äôs history,‚Äù he concluded.

Meanwhile, Peter Handscomb will lead Victoria as he replaces wicketkeeper Matthew Wade.

Three infants die in Raipur govt hospital,"Ten days after deaths of more than 60 children were reported at a Gorakhpur hospital, allegedly due to lack of oxygen supply, three infants have died at Raipur‚Äôs biggest state-run hospital, their deaths coinciding with a critical drop in the oxygen storage unit for the neo-natal ward.

Government officials have claimed the drop in oxygen levels in the storage unit had no effect on oxygen supply to the ward. Speaking to reporters at Bhimrao Ambedkar Hospital Monday, Subrat Sahu, Principal Secretary, Health, said that between 5 and 5.30 pm on Saturday, a doctor at the neo-natal unit noticed that the indicator on the oxygen reservoir had dropped. ‚ÄúThe doctor then called the operator, Ravi Chandra, but he did not answer his phone. He has been suspended and arrested, as he was found asleep and inebriated on duty. The doctor then checked the storage unit and the situation was brought back to normal,‚Äù Sahu said.

Sahu, however, said the drop in oxygen level in the reservoir did not mean any obstruction in oxygen supply to the ward. ‚ÄúThe oxygen supply has two parallel systems, and none of those were affected. There was absolutely no effect on the oxygen supply to the wards,‚Äù he said.

Sahu said two of the three children died hours before 5 pm. While one child died at 12.30 pm following complications of early delivery and low birth weight, another died at 1.20 pm because of meconium aspiration, he said. The third child, who died at 1 am, was suffering from a heart ailment, said Sahu.

Prakash Vishwakarma, father of one of the children, said they had come from Balaghat in MP. ‚ÄúIn Balaghat, they told us that my daughter had a hole in her heart. We went to Gondia in Maharashtra, but they told us to go to hospitals in Raipur. The first one we went to was shut, and on Saturday, we admitted her here. They say she died last night but we were only told in the morning, and we have not been told why. She was only five days old. We hadn‚Äôt even named her,‚Äù he said.

Despite government officials insisting that the drop in oxygen levels did not affect operations in the neo-natal ward, questions abound. Asked why conclusions were being drawn without post-mortem on any of the three children, officials said the operation was not routine practice in ‚Äúnatural deaths‚Äù.

The state government issued a statement, saying that CM Raman Singh has ordered an enquiry into the incident.

The Opposition has alleged that the government was attempting to cover up the deaths.

After missing ODI cricket for a long time due to an impasses with the board, Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels are set to play in the fifty-over format for their country as they were picked in the Jason Holder-led squad for the ODI series in England. While Gayle last played an ODI in March, 2015, Samuels‚Äô last appearance came back in October, 2016.

The duo‚Äôs return to the squad is after a relaxation in Cricket West Indies‚Äô eligibility criteria for selection. Earlier, to play a format, players had to be available in domestic tournament corresponding the same. There was a change in policy in July this year and the players were offered an amnesty.

‚ÄúWith regards to the selection of the ODI squad, the panel welcomes back Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels, who will both add value to our batting and help with the nurturing of the young batsmen in the team,‚Äù chairman of selectors Courtney Browne was quoted by Cricinfo. ‚ÄúBoth Sunil Narine and Darren Bravo have declined to be considered for ODIs in England. Narine has however confirmed his desire to play 50-over cricket again but has asked to play in our Regional Super50 before he is considered and Darren said he was not available for selection. Dwayne Bravo said he is still not 100% fit, but is looking at a possible return to international cricket next year.‚Äù

Apprenticeship Rules: DIPP requests MSDE to extend self-certification duration for start-ups,"The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has requested the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) to extend the duration of the self-certification system for start-ups, which shows that they are in compliance with Apprenticeship Rules, 1992, from one year to five years.

Currently, start-ups that hire apprentices or interns do not have to undergo inspection in the first year of their existence by the apprenticeship officials of either state or the Centre. Such start-ups have to just submit a self-declaration stating that they are in compliance with the Apprenticeship Rules, 1992. This step was taken to

incentivise start-ups to engage more and more apprentices.

On May 17 this year, DIPP secretary Ramesh Abhishek wrote a letter to cabinet secretary P K Sinha wherein he stated: ‚ÄúThe DIPP has requested the MSDE for extension of tenure for self-certification of compliance with the Apprenticeship Rules from one year to five years.‚Äù

Abhishek wrote the letter to Sinha to give details about the implementation of the Startup India programme, which

was launched by the Prime Minister on January 16, 2016, to provide impetus to start-ups across the country.

According to the Apprenticeship Rules, 1992, any establishment may be inspected by an officer, who must not be below the rank of assistant apprenticeship advisor, after prior approval of the Central or the state apprenticeship advisor.

On January 15, 2016, the MSDE had issued an advisory, wherein it stated: ‚ÄúIn the first year of setting up of start-ups,

inspection be completely dispensed with against self-declaration. From the second year onward up to the next three years, start-ups may be taken up for inspection only when very credible and verifiable compliant of violation has been filed in writing and the approval has been obtained from the apprenticeship advisor.‚Äù

The MSDE, which sent this advisory to apprenticeship advisors across the country and all Regional Directors of Apprenticeship Training, added: ‚ÄúYou are, therefore, requested to direct concerned departments in your state/UT (union territory) to regulate the inspection of start-ups, as suggested above, wherever applicable.‚Äù

According to the MSDE, the Apprentices Act, 1961 was amended on December 22, 2014, to make it more ‚Äúuser-friendly to industry as well as to the youth‚Äù. The ministry stated in the advisory: ‚ÄúEstablishment has been allowed for selection of trades and self-regulation of engagement of apprentices in a band of minimum 2.5 per cent to maximum 10 per cent of the total strength of establishment including contract workers. The procedure for

furnishing regular information through returns have been simplified by providing them through apprenticeship portal.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office (PMO) has also directed the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE) to ensure that all states have established a system under which start-ups are allowed self-certification with regard to six labour laws, for a period of five years.

The six labour laws under which self certification is advised are: The Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996; The Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979; The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970; The Employees‚Äô Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952; The Employees‚Äô State Insurance Act, 1948; The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.

On May 17, 2017, Abhishek told Sinha, : ‚ÄúThe MoLE has been directed by the principal secretary to PM to ensure that all states ensure compliance (of this advisory) at the earliest.‚Äù The MoLE, in its advisory dated January 12, 2016, suggested the states to not inspect the start-ups, during first three years of their existence, under these

six labour laws. Instead, the states were advised to ask the start-ups to submit an online self-declaration annually for three years. Later on, the MoLE said that this period should be extended from three years to five years. Currently, approximately 12 states, including Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand have implemented this advisory.

India hails Donald Trump‚Äôs tough line on Pakistan,"US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

WITHIN HOURS of US President Donald Trump spelling out his administration‚Äôs strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia, 16 years after the US launched its war on terror, New Delhi ‚Äúwelcomed‚Äù his ‚Äúdetermination‚Äù to confront the issues of safe havens and other forms of cross-border support enjoyed by terrorists ‚Äî an apparent reference to Pakistan.

Warning Pakistan against the continued support to terror networks, Trump said: ‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond‚Ä¶ Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists.‚Äù

Shortly after Trump‚Äôs speech, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), in a statement, said, ‚ÄúWe welcome President Trump‚Äôs determination to enhance efforts to overcome the challenges facing Afghanistan and confronting issues of safe havens and other forms of cross-border support enjoyed by terrorists. India shares these concerns and objectives‚Äù.

Sources said that US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called up External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj before Trump‚Äôs speech to give the Indian government a ‚Äúheads up‚Äù on the broad elements of the US strategy.

This, sources said, will form one of the core areas of bilateral conversation between India and the US in the coming months, especially in the new 2+2 dialogue format between Defence and External Affairs Ministers of both countries. This new format is going to replace the Obama administration‚Äôs Strategic and Commercial Dialogue (S&CD) between Foreign and Commerce Cinisters.

The MEA also reiterated India‚Äôs commitment to remain engaged in achieving a stable and strong Afghanistan. ‚ÄúWe are committed to supporting the government and the people of Afghanistan in their efforts to bring peace, security, stability and prosperity in their country. We have been steadfast in extending reconstruction and development assistance to Afghanistan in keeping with our traditional friendship with its people. We will continue these efforts, including in partnership with other countries,‚Äù it said.

The MEA‚Äôs statement was in response to Trump reaching out to India in his speech. ‚ÄúWe appreciate India‚Äôs important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development,‚Äù said the US President.

From New Delhi‚Äôs perspective, Trump‚Äôs statement has been broken down into two parts. First is the six-month-old US government‚Äôs ‚Äúclear and robust‚Äù language on terrorist safe havens in Pakistan. ‚ÄúThis is a much-needed acknowledgement and change in the US approach,‚Äù said an Indian diplomat.

Indian officials are particularly enthused by Trump‚Äôs reference to Pakistan when he said, ‚ÄúFor its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and terror‚Ä¶ Pakistan has also sheltered the same organisations that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars, at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country‚Äôs harboring of militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace.‚Äù

This, sources said, is a much stronger statement than the US President Barack Obama‚Äôs statement in 2009. ‚ÄúWe will strengthen Pakistan‚Äôs capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known and whose intentions are clear. America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan‚Äôs democracy and development,‚Äù he had said.

Officials said what needs to be seen is the follow-up action against Pakistan-based groups by the Trump administration. ‚ÄúEarly signs like listing Hizbul Mujahideen and Syed Salahuddin have been quite encouraging. It needs to be seen whether the US government keeps the heat on through measures,‚Äù said the Indian government official.

The other aspect, that is important from New Delhi‚Äôs perspective is Trump urging India to step up its engagement.

According to Delhi, its commitment of US$ 3 billion is a significant contribution. Officials here said that India is the fifth-largest aid provider to Afghanistan, 4,000 Afghan officers are trained in Indian defence and police academies, India has given attack helicopters to Afghan security forces, 16,000 Afghan students are studying in India. And on the infrastructure front, India has constructed the Afghan parliament, the Salma Dam, and the Zaranj Delaram highway.

‚ÄúWhen the US President says that India needs to do more‚Ä¶ it is an under-appreciation of India‚Äôs contribution in the hostile conditions created by Pakistan-sponsored and fuelled groups. We are a bit confused, but that is definitely going to be discussed between our leaders during the 2+2 dialogue or other bilateral meetings. Let‚Äôs see what they have in mind,‚Äù said an Indian diplomat. He, however, added that India is ready to do more, and will continue to do more. ‚ÄúWhat sometimes goes unnoticed are the small development projects that the Indian government does, which is extremely need-based of Afghan people‚Ä¶and they are not big bang projects,‚Äù said the diplomat.

Asked about Trump‚Äôs reference to India making ‚Äúbillions of dollars in trade‚Äù with US, the official quipped, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs his typical style to put transactional ideas, prefacing any demand. We have seen it earlier during Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs visit, not to be worried about.‚Äù

For Delhi, what is also important is that it does not want to get drawn into the equivalence and hyphenation as was proposed during the Obama administration, when it appointed Richard Holbrooke who tried to link India and Pakistan‚Äôs bilateral issues in Kashmir with Afghanistan‚Äôs problems.

So, some in Delhi expressed a sense of trepidation at Trump‚Äôs statement that ‚Äúthe threat is worse because Pakistan and India are two nuclear-armed states whose tense relations threaten to spiral into conflict. And that could happen.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe last thing we want is being drawn into an India-Pakistan hyphenation when it comes to US strategy in Afghanistan‚Ä¶ but we understand this is a reference about South Asia. But we will have to keep a hawk‚Äôs eye on where this is going,‚Äù said the Indian official.

"After Charlottesville, Boston aims to avert violence at ‚ÄòFree Speech‚Äô rally","A large crowd of people march towards the Boston Commons to protest the Boston Free Speech Rally in Boston, MA, U.S., August 19, 2017. (Source: Reuters) A large crowd of people march towards the Boston Commons to protest the Boston Free Speech Rally in Boston, MA, U.S., August 19, 2017. (Source: Reuters)

Hundreds of police officers will hit the streets of Boston on Saturday to deter violence at a ‚ÄúFree Speech‚Äù rally with right-wing speakers a week after a woman was killed at a Virginia white-supremacist protest. At least 500 police officers, many on bicycles, aim to keep the expected crowd of a few hundred people at the ‚ÄúFree Speech‚Äù rally separate from thousands attending a counter-protest by people who believe the event could become a platform for racist propaganda.

Authorities will close streets to avert car attacks like the deadly one carried out in Charlottesville, Virginia, by a man said to have neo-Nazi sympathies against counter-protesters and a similar spate of attacks by Islamist extremists in Europe, most recently Barcelona. After Charlottesville‚Äôs bloody street battles, Boston outlawed weapons of any kind ‚Äì including sticks used to hold signs ‚Äì in the protest area and ordered food vendors out of Boston Common, the nation‚Äôs oldest park.

The violent clashes in Charlottesville, in which one woman was killed in the car rampage, ratcheted up racial tensions already inflamed by white supremacist groups marching more openly in rallies across the United States. White nationalists had converged in the Southern university city to defend a statue of Robert E. Lee, who led the army of the pro-slavery Confederacy during the Civil War, which ended in 1865.

A growing number of U.S. political leaders have called for statues honoring the Confederacy to be taken down, with civil rights activists charging that they promote racism. Advocates of the statues contend they are a reminder of their heritage. Last weekend‚Äôs violence sparked the biggest domestic crisis yet for U.S. President Donald Trump, who provoked ire across the political spectrum for not immediately condemning white nationalists and for praising ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù on both sides of the fight.

Beyond the Boston rally and counter-march, protests are also expected on Saturday in Texas, with the Houston chapter of Black Lives Matter holding a rally to remove a ‚ÄúSpirit of the Confederacy‚Äù monument from a park and civil rights activists in Dallas planning a rally against white supremacy.

COUNTER-PROTESTERS REJECT PLEA

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh on Friday asked counter-protesters to avoid Boston Common, saying their presence would draw more attention to the far-right activists. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre urging everyone to stay away,‚Äù Walsh said. Monica Cannon, an organizer of the ‚ÄúFight White Supremacy‚Äù march, rejected that call. ‚ÄúIgnoring a problem has never solved it,‚Äù Cannon said in a phone interview. ‚ÄúWe cannot continue to ignore racism, ignore white supremacism, ignore neo-Nazis and pretend it‚Äôs not a problem.‚Äù

Organizers of the ‚ÄúFree Speech‚Äù rally denounced the violence and racist chants of the Charlottesville ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù protest. ‚ÄúWe are a coalition of libertarians, progressives, conservatives, and independents and we welcome all individuals and organizations from any political affiliations that are willing to peaceably engage in open dialogue about the threats to, and importance of, free speech and civil liberties,‚Äù the group said on Facebook.

The event‚Äôs scheduled speakers include Kyle Chapman, a California activist who was arrested at a Berkeley rally earlier this year that turned violent, and Joe Biggs, formerly of the right-wing conspiracy site Infowars.

"Italy, France and Germany ask European Union to boost powers to block foreign acquisitions: Reports","‚ÄúIt is not a form of protectionism but rather giving a chance of monitoring operations that are incompatible with European rules,‚Äù Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda was quoted as saying in La Stampa. (Representative Image) ‚ÄúIt is not a form of protectionism but rather giving a chance of monitoring operations that are incompatible with European rules,‚Äù Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda was quoted as saying in La Stampa. (Representative Image)

Italy, France and Germany have asked the European Commission to reinforce existing regulations that allow EU states to block foreign acquisitions of European companies, two Italian dailies reported on Tuesday. The request cited the ‚Äògolden powers‚Äô to bar or set conditions for would-be buyers ‚Äúthat operate with rules that do not follow the market and that do not respect rules of reciprocity for acquisitions,‚Äù Il Sole 24 Ore and La Stampa reported, citing a leaked letter. European Union leaders agreed in June to consider screening investments by state-owned Chinese firms, and France, Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments.

The letter was sent to the Commission on July 28 and follows a similar one in February. Although it mentions no countries or firms by name, it appears to have been motivated by recent takeovers by Beijing in Europe. The powers would be reinforced for all target companies viewed as strategic and in cases of takeovers financed by state funds or agencies, says the ten-page document cited by the newspapers.

‚ÄúIt is not a form of protectionism but rather giving a chance of monitoring operations that are incompatible with European rules,‚Äù Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda was quoted as saying in La Stampa.

The three countries recommended that under the new regulations, which should not replace national rules, member states should notify the Commission every six months of all corporate investments from outside the bloc, except those in the defence sector.

Bollywood actress Diana Penty walked the ramp for Hyderabad-based designer Shriya Bhupal who unveiled her collection ‚ÄòVignette Vista‚Äô under her label Shriya Som on Sunday.

The designer narrated a tale of wilderness with elegance that was suave, which was clearly visible in the detailed presentation.



Diana Penty looked radiantly stunning as she strutted down the ramp in a structured, ball-room worthy, floral, ivory gown with intricate detail.

The garments were conventional yet trendy; and ranged from body-con creations, shifts, and midi dresses with ruffle detail to cropped top, power suits, exaggerated gowns, power-shoulder top teamed with a fish tail skirt, faux fur jackets.

Experimentation in pastel hues was seen with the use of ivory, blush pink and tones of grey to bring the attires alive. Feathers incorporated with bugle and minute beads, stones, sequins, crystals and fine silk thread composed exquisite and exaggerated motifs served as the soul of this ingenious composition.

Designer Sonaakshi Raaj's collection spells ultra-glam looks on the ramp and the designer‚Äôs latest offering ‚ÄòSkin‚Äô at Lakm√© Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 was just that. It was a modern yet slightly whimsical look as the designer presented a peep show with the very unconventionally embellished PVC.

The colour palette spoke glamour, from rose gold, crimson to champagne, smoke grey and charcoal black. And showstopper Pooja Hegde walked the ramp in an embellished gold jumpsuit with a trail, looking like an absolute diva while doing it.

The show opened with Indian singer and multi-instrumentalist Raghav Sachar who performed some foot-tapping songs and grooved around the models with music that elevated the mood on the runway with soulful trumpet melodies.



Making a strong fashion statement on the catwalk was the one-shoulder, black asymmetric drape teamed wonderfully with a white corset and tantalizing sheer yoke.

The seductive drapes wove magic around the graceful models‚Äô figures as tulle, blended georgette; fringing and ornate embellishments were the cynosure of the garments.



Using PVC in a truly innovative style, Sonaakshi ensured that the ‚ÄòSkin‚Äô collection was a m√©lange of various genres of fashion. Moving from street wear to high fashion accents, the ensembles were ideal for all style setters.

The all-black dhoti inspired sari with a matching cropped blouse offered a PVC peep show at the hem. Grecian drama appeared for the one-sleeved asymmetric white pant/gown while dazzle was the focal point for the off-shoulder sleek maxi with floor length cape sleeves.

At Lakm√© Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017, ‚ÄòAiyana‚Äô (ever blooming) presented by Amoh by Jade was their take on reviving the cult fashion of the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs eras, with a rather inventive approach in terms of construction and presentation.

Bollywood debutant Nidhi Agerwal of ‚ÄòMunna Michael‚Äô fame opened the show in a embroidered lehenga with a backless cropped blouse and pleasantly surprised the audience. While pop- culture, youth icon, Ananya Birla took the stage, while sporting a look from the collection and performed her hit number ‚ÄòMeant to Be‚Äô alongside the models and received the loudest cheer from the crowd.

The silhouettes ranged from well-tailored corsets and capes to floor length sheer jackets with scallop detail teamed with flared skirts and inventive drapes with cowl detailing. The bold palette consisting of tangerine, royal blue, ox-blood, mauve, chestnut, bottle green and a hint of gold elevated the collection.

Monica and Karishma of Jade portrayed the various layers of a woman‚Äôs personality, defining her flaws and depth with grace and artistry through their extremely innovative pieces for their collection ‚ÄòAiyana‚Äô.

The ensembles were delicately ornamented with beads, stones in intricate patterns and motifs, which highlighted the regal essence of the sharply conceived line.

The sustainable fabrics were used to create these majestic attires with added textures (ruffles, pleats) that enhanced the oomph factor.

Inspired by the colours and fashion of the Byzantine period, which was seen during the Roman Empire, designer Jayanti Reddy brought the razzle-dazzle of the past onto the catwalk. The ensembles worked wonders in accentuating women‚Äôs curves with fitted and flared shapes.

Aditi Rao Hydari turned showstopper for her in a black full-flared lehenga, maxi Anarkali style jacket, soft gold bandeau blouse and dupatta, all embroidered in golden hues and looked like a Byzantine period princess.

The rich fabrics like silks, velvets and tulles were ideal for the creations but it was the construction and the colours that were the focal point of the garments. Deep hues of smoky grey, rich mustard, royal blue, elegant mauve, hot pink, pastel teal and dramatic black, gave intense style directions to the garments.

There was a variety of silhouettes with lehengas, jackets, shararas, blouses, shawls, tunics and pants. Numerous blouses offered a fashion twist - either asymmetric hemline, peplum fits or were teamed with full-length jackets. Heavy ruffles and exaggerated tassels added to the royal element in the collection.

Divya Reddy made a strong fashion statement when she declared ‚Äògreen‚Äô as the new black, at 6Degree Studio during Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Gearing her designs to ethical, ecological, sustainable fashion, her collection ‚ÄòSage‚Äô projected a harmonious peaceful vibe.

In true show stopper fashion, the critically acclaimed actress, Tapsee Pannu wore the hottest shade of pink. Wearing a stunning floor-length, long-sleeved, intricately, embellished jacket over a sheer delicately embroidered piece, her outfit was a definite trendsetter for women who want to make their mark in the crowd and look glamorous.

The USP of Divya‚Äôs collection was the fabric, which had a great fashion story. The Kolam tribe in the Kawal forest collected the cocoons after the flight of the butterflies. These were turned into exquisite silk, spun by using double spun technique, where the broken strands are double spun and stuck together to create strong silk yarn with a slubby nature called Madhepur Tussar. The deep moss green hue was a constant for most ensembles.

ayered, frilled, maxi skirts were worn with matching body-hugging, long-sleeved, embroidered cholis with flouncy cuffs; while the modern version of the lehenga with abstract work and graduating yellow, brown, blue, maroon, striped, hemline looked stunning with an embellished fan-sleeved cropped top. Sheer and bell-sleeves teamed with heavy oxidised pieces of chunky jewellery gave the silhouettes that extra touch of perfection.

Kusum and Karishma Luharuwal for their label Faabiiana presented a m√©lange of unconventional textiles with their collection ‚ÄúDesert Rose‚Äù at the Lakm√© Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Bringing the glow in the dark elements, the silhouettes were inspired by moody, moonlit florals mesmerizingly blended with hues of ash rose and blush to show the lighter side of the day.

The lovely Dia Mirza left the audience in awe when she walked the ramp in a fully embroidered deep ‚ÄòV‚Äô neck, floor-length Chikankari jacket and ghaghra with perfect Gota work.

Grandeur and glamour came alive on the ramp as breathtaking supreme craftsmanship was entwined with the garments that spoke a language of the Rajasthani royalty and its magnificence. Offering the New Age woman a fashion option that was experimental yet timeless were unconventional, understated yet classic silhouettes that added a tinge of romanticism to the designs.

Fashion took an interesting path as delicate zardosi was intricately fused with Mukaish, Chikankari, Gota, Aari work to showcase a pleasant blend of fashion and earthly glamour. The colours merged seamlessly as dusty shades of ash rose; blush came alive with olive green and slate grey.

Highlighting the similarities between the ensembles and the season the idea showed ‚Äúgrowth and fall‚Äù in a mesmerizing manner, Ruchi Roongta and Rashi Agarwal for their label ‚ÄòRuceru‚Äô offered a collection ‚ÄúThe Fallen Leaves‚Äù that was flamboyant yet eccentric on Day 5.

The classy Bollywood actor from the hit movie ‚ÄòToilet‚Äô Bhumi Pednekar graced the ramp in a red floral, embroidered Ghaghra. The merger of the sleeve with the bodice and honey combed embroidery along the hem, complemented the ensemble.

Putting embellishments to a minimal so as to allow each piece to stand out as a work of art by itself, the designers opted for fluid fabrics like silk, tissue, Chanderi, Habutai, raw silks and silk organza. Fabrics were dyed in autumn colour palette like beige, brown, olive and warm red that gave the garments an edgy and intriguing appeal.

An interesting and unique concept was the blending of the sleeves with the bodice, dupatta and lehenga. Honey combed embroidery and fringes on the silhouettes spoke of a trend setting look. Deriving its surface development techniques along with its colour palette from nature, the range aimed to depict emotions ‚Äì raw and unaltered by using silhouettes for a canvas.

Nancy Luharuwalla‚Äôs label ‚ÄòDe Belle‚Äô presented an exciting and innovative but totally wearable women‚Äôs wear collection ‚ÄúAllure By De Belle‚Äù at the 6Degree Studio. Inspired from an early era of 1950‚Äôs, the line aimed at making the woman of today as beautiful as she envisaged it.

Blending western and Indian designs with textile fabrics were a range of silhouettes with tenderness and softness in them to make them look glamorous. The gorgeous Bollywood actor, Illeana D‚ÄôCruz graced the ramp in a black off- shoulder, full-flared dress with floor-kissing sleeves. Bold floral motifs mesmerizingly added the right touches of glamour.

A touch of the retro revolution was witnessed as trench coats, short jackets with puff sleeves, boleros, waistcoats and extreme shoulders with oxidized embroidery made their classy and bold attempt on the ramp.

Enthralling the audience with her stunning fashion offerings, the fabrics used were raw silk and cr√™pe alongside a treasure trove of sari jackets that derived their inspiration from great Ancient history. The silhouettes came alive in a riot of pastel colours ranging from aqua marine, baby pink and moving onto darker shades like forest green and deep wine.

Hardika Gulati presented a line of silhouettes with high-octane creativity that will set the look for the coming season with its mystical yet dramatic appeal.



Inspired by mythological characters, specifically the human traits of love, courage, valour, righteousness, hatred, revenge and violence, the collection, focused on ‚ÄúSita‚Äù and ‚ÄúDraupadi‚Äù renowned as the icons of Indian womanhood.

Gorgeous Kiara Advani from the blockbuster film ‚ÄòM S Dhoni‚Äô, wore a black fitted dress with a layered, textured and structured bodice. The floor - length cape sleeves were a perfect addition to this fierce yet mesmerizingly appealing silhouette.

With silhouettes inspired by the 1960‚Äôs the range showcased striking ensembles that matched the Avant-garde look. Creating a blend of new techniques and classics, were suiting textured fabrics like checks with a woollen blend progressing to Neoprene."

(Source: File) In his career, Marcelinho has represented Atletico Madrid ‚ÄòB‚Äô, Getafe ‚ÄòB‚Äô, Greek clubs like Skoda Xanthi FC. (Source: File)

Indian Super League side FC Pune City on Tuesday announced the roping in of the last edition golden boot winner Marcelo Pereira for the upcoming season.

The Brazilian winger, who has plied his trade in Spain, Greece and Italy, represented Delhi Dynamos FC last season. In his 15 appearances, Marcelinho scored 10 goals and made five assists.

FC Pune City CEO Gaurav Modwel was excited on the new addition to his team. ‚ÄúMarcelinho has a great appetite for scoring and caused

some serious damage to other teams‚Äô defence in ISL last season. He is a busy player on the pitch, always in the thick of things ‚Äî setting the pace, assisting and finding the back of the net. I know our fans really wanted him to don the FC Pune City jersey! Welcome Marcelinho,‚Äù he said.

In his career spanning almost a decade now, Marcelinho has represented Atletico Madrid ‚ÄòB‚Äô, Getafe ‚ÄòB‚Äô, Greek clubs like Skoda Xanthi FC, Atromitos Athens, Kalamata among others.

Head coach Antonio Habas said, ‚ÄúMarcelinho is one of the most accomplished attackers we have seen in ISL. He has the versatility to play on wings as well as in front of the net along with great pace to match his abilities. These qualities will be of great help to the team and hope we can achieve results that we aim for in the coming season.‚Äù

On donning the orange and purple jersey this time, Marcelinho said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exciting times ahead as I join FC Pune City. Antonio Habas is a great coach to work with and his vision for the club is something that got me excited. I will give my 100 % and ensure my stint with FC Pune City gives the Orange Army many reasons to celebrate.‚Äù

People reposed faith in development work: CM Devendra Fadnavis,"Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also attributed the success in the satellite town to team work. (File) Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also attributed the success in the satellite town to team work. (File)

Following its victory in the Mira-Bhayander civic polls, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday gave credit to the government‚Äôs development plank for successive electoral victories in the municipal corporations, zilla parishads and municipal councils across Maharashtra. ‚ÄúThe Mira-Bhayander victory is the trust people have reposed in development works of the government. It is a mandate for vikas and vishwas. My government is committed to fulfill the aspirations of people by expediting the development projects,‚Äù Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said. He also attributed the success in the satellite town to team work.

The victory in Mira-Bhayander has established the ruling BJP as a leading political force in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) encompassing nine civic bodies including Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivali, Panvel, Ulhasnagar, Navi Mumbai, Bhiwandi, Thane and Vasai-Virar. The party has edged out the political dominance of the Shiv Sena, which is left with a majority in only Thane.

Apart from Mira-Bhayander, BJP has majority in Panvel and Ulhasnagar (along with a local party). The BJP, in alliance with the Sena, is in power in Kalyan-Dombivali and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. However, the Shiv Sena had supported the Congress in Navi Mumbai. In Vasai Virar the leading party is the Bahujan Vikas Party. The BJP, which is planning to contest the assembly elections alone in 2019, believes the consolidation of party in the MMR would help them in the assembly elections.

BJP political managers said, ‚ÄúIf we look at all the elections held in the last 34 months in zilla parishads and municipal corporations across Maharashtra, Fadnavis has struck to the development plank. The paradigm shift in politics has helped the BJP to connect to the generation next voters giving the party huge leads.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn Mira-Bhayander, two projects that turned the tide in favour of BJP was the Metro and Surya dam. It concerned drinking water and transport issues, most crucial for people in the township,‚Äù said the party‚Äôs political managers.

Another significant point cited was that the development plank has helped the party in new-age social engineering to get people across caste, community and religion to its fold. The 60 seats would not have been possible without the support of Christians, the party believes. So far, the BJP has in its kitty almost all major civic bodies including Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Solapur, Nashik, Akola, Amravati, and Nagpur. In elections to zilla parishads too, the BJP tally reveals a threefold increase.

US targets Chinese and Russia entities over North Korea,"The Trump administration is still hoping China will pressure North Korea.(Source: AP Photo) The Trump administration is still hoping China will pressure North Korea.(Source: AP Photo)

The United States is imposing new North Korea-related sanctions, targeting Chinese and Russian firms and individuals for supporting Pyongyang‚Äôs weapons programs, US officials announced on Tuesday, but stopped short of an anticipated focus on Chinese banks.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control designated six Chinese-owned entities, one Russian, one North Korean and two based in Singapore. They included a Namibia-based subsidiary of a Chinese company and a North Korean entity operating in Namibia. Six individuals including four Russians, one Chinese and one North Korean were targeted, the Treasury Department said.

The move follows toughened United Nations sanctions agreed this month after North Korea tested its first two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. The Treasury Department said the new sanctions targeted those helping already-designated individuals supporting North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its energy trade. They included three Chinese coal importers.

The steps also targeted those helping North Korea send workers abroad and enabling sanctioned North Korea entities to get access to the US and international financial system. ‚ÄúTreasury will continue to increase pressure on North Korea by targeting those who support the advancement of nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and isolating them from the American financial system,‚Äù Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said in a statement.

‚ÄúIt is unacceptable for individuals and companies in China, Russia, and elsewhere to enable North Korea to generate income used to develop weapons of mass destruction.‚Äù A new round of US sanctions had been expected, but Washington appeared to delay them while securing Chinese and Russian support for tougher UN steps.

US officials and UN diplomats say the threat of US ‚Äúsecondary sanctions‚Äù against Chinese firms with North Korean ties and trade pressure helped persuade China to drop opposition to the UN sanctions. The latest steps stopped short of targeting Chinese financial institutions dealing with North Korea, a step that would have greatly angered Beijing. The Trump administration is still hoping China will pressure Pyongyang.

‚ÄúThe sanctions target a range of North Korea‚Äôs illicit activities and the focus on Chinese facilitators is another message to Beijing,‚Äù said Anthony Ruggiero, a Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior fellow and former US Treasury official. ‚ÄúHowever, there are missing elements. There‚Äôs no focus on the efforts of Chinese banks that facilitate these transactions. In addition, these Chinese networks likely have additional front companies operating on behalf of the network and those were not sanctioned.‚Äù

China is North Korea‚Äôs neighbor and main trading partner and US foreign policy experts say Chinese companies have long had a key role in financing Pyongyang. The Chinese and Russians embassies in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. China has said in the past it is strongly opposed to unilateral sanctions outside the U.N. framework, and has accused the United States of using ‚Äúlong-arm‚Äù jurisdiction in targeting Chinese entities.

China warns US ahead of Taiwan defence minister‚Äôs brief visit,"Taiwan Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan attends a parliamentary session at Legislative Yuan in Taipei. (Source: Reuters) Taiwan Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan attends a parliamentary session at Legislative Yuan in Taipei. (Source: Reuters)

China warned the United States on Tuesday against any military contacts with Taiwan ahead of brief visits by the self-ruled island‚Äôs defence minister to the United States on his way to and from Central American allies. The United States is Taiwan‚Äôs main source of weapons and Taiwan has been pressing for sales of more advanced equipment to deal with the rapidly modernising military of China, which claims Taiwan as its own.

Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan would make brief transit stops in New York and Los Angeles on his Aug 23-Sept. 8 trip, and had nothing else on his agenda in the United States, the ministry said.

Feng would visit Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic to ‚Äúfurther deepen bilateral friendly relations‚Äù, the ministry said in a statement.

Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had noted the reports. ‚ÄúChina consistently insists on using the ‚Äòone China‚Äô principle in handling the issue of the Taiwan region‚Äôs exchanges, and firmly opposes country‚Äôs with which China has established relations conducting any type of official contact or military exchanges with Taiwan,‚Äù Hua told reporters.

‚ÄúOur position is clear and consistent. I believe the United States is extremely clear on this.‚Äù

Taiwan presidents and other senior officials frequently stop over in the United States while visiting Taiwan‚Äôs dwindling number of allies in Latin America and the Caribbean, always drawing China‚Äôs ire.

China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and has stepped up military drills around the island in recent months. Proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China.

Taiwan now only has official diplomatic ties with 20 countries. Panama dropped its diplomatic ties with Taiwan to instead recognise China in June. China says Taiwan is merely a province with no right to diplomatic ties with other countries.

The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, acknowledging that China takes the position that there is ‚Äúone China‚Äù and Taiwan is part of it. But the United States is also duty-bound by legislation to help the island defend itself.

"We have reasons to be happy, says Manchester United‚Äôs Juan Mata","Manchester United‚Äôs Juan Mata passes the ball as West Ham United‚Äôs Winston Reid challenges (Source: Reuters) Manchester United‚Äôs Juan Mata passes the ball as West Ham United‚Äôs Winston Reid challenges (Source: Reuters)

Despite a great start to the new season of the English Premier League after a rather lackluster season, Manchester United‚Äôs midfielder Juan Mata said that they would not read too much into it yet.

Jose Mourinho‚Äôs men currently stand on top of the table with six points and most number of goals. They faced West Ham and Swansea City in 2017-18 season, defeating both the teams by 4-0. Mata, in his weekly blog wrote, ‚ÄúIn terms of football, the week ends with a very good feeling again, following another convincing victory, although perhaps the score was too high.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne thing is for sure, we have reasons to be happy with the confidence and determination that we are showing on the pitch, but we also know that this is just the beginning.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe next weekend we have a new opportunity to keep gaining momentum, this time against Leicester, always a tough opponent,‚Äù said the Spaniard. ‚ÄúIt would be great to take the first international break of the season with nine points out of nine.‚Äù

New signing from Everton has impressed critics and fans alike with his performance, having scored a brace in his debut.

In recent reports, Zlatan Ibrahimovic is expected to sign a new contract with the Old Trafford side. He was the leading goal-scorer of last season, despite missing most of the second half due to injury.

"EU Commission starts in-depth probe of Bayer, Monsanto deal","FILE ‚Äì In this May 23, 2016 file picture the Bayer AG corporate logo is displayed on a building of the German drug and chemicals company in Berlin, Germany.

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber,file)

The European Commission has started an in-depth investigation of Bayer‚Äôs planned $66 billion takeover of US seeds group Monsanto, saying it was worried about competition in pesticide and seeds markets. The merger would create the world‚Äôs largest integrated pesticides and seeds company, the Commission said, adding this limited the amount of competitors selling herbicides and vegetable seeds in Europe.

‚ÄúThe Commission has preliminary concerns that the proposed acquisition could reduce competition in a number of different markets resulting in higher prices, lower quality, less choice and less innovation,‚Äù the European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday. Germany‚Äôs Bayer said it still aimed to have the transaction approved by the end of the year.

‚ÄúBayer looks forward to continuing to work constructively with the Commission with a view to obtaining the Commission‚Äôs approval,‚Äù the company said in a statement. Bayer had previously offered commitments aimed at easing the EU‚Äôs antitrust concerns over the deal with Monsanto, but the company declined to say what was proposed.

If approved, the deal would be the third large tie-up in the agrochemicals sector but other companies also had to offer concessions to win over regulators. Dow secured regulatory clearance to acquire DuPont only after pledging to sell key research and development activities and other major assets.

And ChemChina had to sell a large chunk of its subsidiary Adama‚Äôs pesticide, herbicides and insecticides business, its seed treatment products for cereals and sugar beet and a substantial part of its plant growth regulator business for cereals to win EU approval to buy Syngenta. The Commission said it was working with regulators in other markets, such as the Unted States, Australia and Brazil to vet the Bayer-Monsanto deal.

Bayer offered to sell its Liberty crop chemical, also known as glufosinate, and canola and cotton seeds that resist the chemical‚Äôs plant-killing effect to get approval for the deal from South African regulators. The proposed tie-up has also hit a raw nerve with some environmental activists who fear such a combination would hurt farmers and consumers.

US based campaign group Avaaz said it had submitted a petition with one million signatures to Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, calling on her to block the deal. ‚ÄúOver a million people are calling on her to block the merger from hell,‚Äù said Avaaz legal director Nick Flynn. The Commission said it would asses the deal only from a competition perspective.

U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will not attend the Kennedy Center Honors in December, the White House announced on Saturday, after several honorees said they would boycott a White House reception before the show. The Kennedy Center also said in a statement the White House reception ‚Äúwill no longer take place.‚Äù The White House said the president and first lady would not take part in the Kennedy Center Honors ‚Äúto allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction.‚Äù

The announcement came after television producer Norman Lear, singer Lionel Richie and dancer Carmen de Lavallade said they would not attend the White House reception that was set to take place prior to the Dec. 3 annual gala event. The other honorees are singer Gloria Estefan and rapper LL Cool J. The awards are presented each year in December to recognize honorees for their lifetime contributions to the arts. All five honorees are expected to attend a Dec. 2 dinner and awards ceremony at the State Department, the Kennedy Center‚Äôs chairman, David Rubenstein, and its president, Deborah Rutter, in a statement.

The Kennedy Center ‚Äúrespects‚Äù the decision made by the Trumps, they said. ‚ÄúIn choosing not to participate in this year‚Äôs Honors activities, the administration graciously signaled its respect for the Kennedy Center and ensures the Honors gala remains a deservingly special moment for the honorees,‚Äù Rubenstein and Rutter said. De Lavallade, an African-American actress, dancer and choreographer, said in a statement on her website that she was honored to receive the award and would attend the show.

But, she said that she would not go to the White House ‚Äúin light of the socially divisive and morally caustic narrative that our existing leadership is choosing to engage in.‚Äù Her comments come after the president blamed ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù for violence that erupted last week between counter-demonstrators and neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and white nationalists holding a ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù rally in Charlottesville, Va.

Trump‚Äôs comments prompted a slew of resignations from presidential councils, including all 17 members of the President‚Äôs Committee on the Arts and Humanities. In a New York Times article on Aug. 3, Lear was quoted as saying that he would forgo the White House reception because, ‚ÄúThis is a presidency that has chosen to neglect totally the arts and humanities ‚Äî deliberately defund them ‚Äî and that doesn‚Äôt rest pleasantly with me.‚Äù

The Kennedy Center Honors is the second annual Washington event that Trump decided not to attend. The president, who called the U.S. news media as ‚Äúenemies of the American people,‚Äù also withdrew from the annual White House Correspondents Dinner.

"Maldives: Army occupies parliament to block no-confidence vote, opposition MPs roughed up","Opposition lawmakers say military siege was an attempt to block no-confidence motion in Parliament. Opposition lawmakers say military siege was an attempt to block no-confidence motion in Parliament.

Maldives‚Äô opposition lawmakers said on Tuesday that the military locked down the nation‚Äôs Parliament in an attempt to block a no-confidence motion to impeach the speaker of the house. They were also allegedly roughed up by military personnel.

Lawmaker Imithiyaz Fahmy from opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) tweeted saying military in plainclothes blocked MPs entering chamber. ‚ÄúSaid MPs cannot enter before 8:55 am. Proceedings begin at 9:00, surrounded by military,‚Äù tweeted Fahmy.

Eva Abdulla, another lawmaker from MDP, said that although the MPs were eventually allowed inside, the Speaker of the house was surrounded by military in plainclothes.

Madlives President Abdulla Yameen has been accused in the past of attempting to reverse democratic progress in a country that became a multiparty democracy relatively recently in 2008. President Yameen had ordered military to barricade the Parliament last month, with reports of frequent scuffle between troops and opposition MPs have taken place in a bid to prevent lawmakers from entering. Also Read: What is happening in the Maldives: All you need to know

Only last month, in an attempt to prevent impeachment, the Maldives military locked the gates of parliament with opposition saying it had majority of votes. While some MPs barged in through the barriers, others were forcibly thrown out. In a statement to the media, the opposition MDP termed President Yameen‚Äôs action as ‚Äúdesperate, illegal and unconstitutional‚Äù.

In July this year, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had urged the government in the Maldives to lift a blockade of parliament and refrain from all acts that result in the harassment and intimidation of lawmakers, civil society and the media.

Guterres voiced concern over ‚Äúgradual erosion of basic democratic norms and principles‚Äù in the country and has urged a dialogue. He called on the government in Maldives ‚Äúto uphold the constitutionally guaranteed rights of speech and assembly‚Äù.

China Construction Bank raising $15 billion in funding for Belt and Road deals,"Chinese President Xi Jinping in May pledged a 4 billion funding boost to help his plan to build a modern Silk Road. (File Photo) Chinese President Xi Jinping in May pledged a 4 billion funding boost to help his plan to build a modern Silk Road. (File Photo)

China Construction Bank Corp (CCB) is raising at least 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) for a fund to finance investments related to Beijing‚Äôs Belt and Road initiative, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The people said China‚Äôs second-biggest bank by assets was raising cash onshore and offshore, and has already been running roadshows with prospective investors. They could not be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.

CCB did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese President Xi Jinping in May pledged a $124 billion funding boost to help his plan to build a modern Silk Road, connecting China with new and old trading partners. He also said China would encourage financial institutions to expand their overseas yuan fund businesses. Beijing is trying to contain overseas deals after some extravagant purchases in recent years, but acquisitions by Chinese companies in countries that are part of the Belt and Road initiative are soaring, totalling $33 billion as of mid-August. That compares with a $31 billion tally for all of 2016, showed Thomson Reuters data.

The people said CCB would raise U.S. dollars for the offshore portion of the fund and yuan from onshore investors. Some of the onshore capital could be used for Belt and Road deals overseas, two of the people said.

"All free to celebrate festivals, but within ambit of law: Yogi Adityanath","The CM went on to say that even if holidays are not declared on festival dates, people will still celebrate Diwali, Raksha Bandhan, Vijaya Dashmi, Christmas, Eid and observe the month of Moharram. (File Photo) The CM went on to say that even if holidays are not declared on festival dates, people will still celebrate Diwali, Raksha Bandhan, Vijaya Dashmi, Christmas, Eid and observe the month of Moharram. (File Photo)

Days after he remarked that if he can‚Äôt stop the offering of namaz on roads during Eid, he had no right to stop celebration of Janmashtami in police stations, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said the state government will give every caste and community complete freedom to celebrate their festivals, provided they do so within the purview of the Constitution and the law.

Addressing a gathering in Saharanpur district, which had recently witnessed caste violence, Adityanath said, ‚ÄúEid ke samay namaz padhne ki baat aayi. Bahut saare logon ne kaha sadkon par Eid padhne denge? Humne kaha, nahi, jo paramparagat roop se padhta aa raha hai usko padhne do..kanoon ke daayre mein reh kar ke jo bhi karya karega koi rok-tok nahi hogi. Hum log samman ke saath har jaati, har mat, har mazhab ko apne parva aur tyoharon ko manane ki puri swatantrata denge, basharte wah kanoon aur samvidhan ke daayre me reh kar ke unko manata hai.‚Äù (Many people asked, will people be allowed to read namaz on the roads during Eid? We said no, let those who read namaz as per tradition do so‚Ä¶we will not stop anyone who stays within the ambit of the law. We will give complete freedom to all castes, communities and religions to celebrate their festials as long as they do so within the purview of the Constitution and the law.)

Reacting to Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav‚Äôs recent statement that when SP comes to power, Rs 5 lakh will be given to each police station to celebrate all festivals, the CM said that those who had ‚Äúbanned‚Äù celebration of festivals are promising monetary support for the same.

Adityanath further said it would have been better had Rs 5 lakh then been given to the public for medical facilities, roads and houses. ‚ÄúThose who looted the state to build their own houses and memorials are preaching to me today,‚Äù he added.

The CM went on to say that even if holidays are not declared on festival dates, people will still celebrate Diwali, Raksha Bandhan, Vijaya Dashmi, Christmas, Eid and observe the month of Moharram. Claiming that his government was providing benefits of schemes to the poor and needy without asking their caste and religion, he said, ‚ÄúWe believe that every citizen living in India is an Indian who has a right on every scheme of the country, provided he learns to behave according to the Indian constitution.‚Äù

Thanking the people of western UP for the ‚Äúsuccessful completion‚Äù of the kanwar yatra, Adityanath said no disturbance was reported while four crore kanwar yatris were on the roads from Saharanpur to Ghaziabad. ‚ÄúThey have set an example of peacefully celebrating festivals,‚Äù he added.

Stating that he was aware of the problems in Saharanpur and adjoining areas, the CM said that the mining and land mafia had ruled this area in the past. He also asked the local administration to ensure that illegal slaughterhouses, if any were still functional, be closed down.

Adityanath said that when the new government was formed, there were 4.32 crore ration cards in the state, of which 25 lakh cards were found to be bogus during the verification process. He alleged that in the past, ration cards were distributed on the basis of ‚Äúpersonal relations‚Äù and not provided to the needy. He was in the district to distribute certificates to beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and ‚Äúfree‚Äù electricity connections.

Wu Lei‚Äôs double puts Shanghai SIPG on verge of Asian Champions League semis,"Wu Lei scored twice as Shanghai SIPG comfortably defeated two-time Asian Champions League winners Guangzhou Evergrande 4-0 on Tuesday in the first leg of their all-Chinese Super League quarter-final of the continental club championship.

Playing for the first time in the Asian Champions League since the departure of Brazilian midfielder Paulinho in a 40 million euro ($47 million) transfer to Barcelona last week, Evergrande were torn apart by Andre Villas-Boas‚Äô side, who are now one game away from their first appearance in the semi-finals of the competition.

‚ÄúSIPG deserved the win,‚Äù said Evergrande coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, whose team lead SIPG by eight points in the domestic standings.

‚ÄúWe paid the price for the tight and intensive match schedule. We also paid the price for the absence of Paulinho, Huang Bowen and Mei Fang and we were playing against such a strong opponent.‚Äù

SIPG controlled the opening half hour, but were only able to find a breakthrough in the 38th minute when Hulk scored from the penalty spot after Zhang Linpeng had bundled Wu Lei over in the area.

A minute into first half stoppage time, SIPG doubled their lead when Wang Shenchao was left unattended from close range to head in Hulk‚Äôs curling cross from the left.

Wu claimed his first goal of the game in the 62nd minute after linking up with substitute Elkeson, who heeled a return ball into the path of the China international who then fired his shot past Guangzhou goalkeeper Zeng Cheng.

Two minutes later, Wu struck again to leave Evergrande with a mountain to climb when the teams meet on September 12, as he finished off a rapid break led by Hulk.

‚ÄúOur players deserved the win,‚Äù said Villas-Boas.

‚ÄúWe have had a very difficult time in the Chinese Super League but today we overcame lots of obstacles and had an excellent game. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been chasing Evergrande all the time. We have to keep in mind that there is the away game to go. Evergrande is a team that keeps winning games all the time.‚Äù

In the western half of the draw, last year‚Äôs runners-up Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates were held to a 0-0 draw by Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Al Hilal in their quarter-final first leg.

The two teams will face each other again on September 11, with the winner meeting either Iran‚Äôs Persepolis or Al Ahli, also of Saudi Arabia.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to say who is closer,‚Äù said Al Ain head coach Zoran Mamic after the draw in front of his club‚Äôs own fans. ‚ÄúWe are satisfied with this result.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt concede a goal, which is very important. And after three weeks I‚Äôm sure my team will be much more ready.‚Äù

Islamic State claims stabbing attack in Russia,"Police work on the site of a knife attack in the center of Surgut, Russia, on Aug. 19, 2017. (Xinhua/Sputnik/IANS) Police work on the site of a knife attack in the center of Surgut, Russia, on Aug. 19, 2017. (Xinhua/Sputnik/IANS)

The Islamic State (IS) terrorist group has claimed responsibility for a knife attack that left seven persons injured in the Russian city of Surgut, media reports said. ‚ÄúThe attacker in the Russian city of Surgut is an Islamic State soldier,‚Äù the group said via its official Amaq news agency on Saturday. Russian authorities have not commented so far, Xinhua news agency reported.

A man, who apparently stabbed passersby on the street at random, was shot dead by police. The attack happened at about 11.20 a.m. The injured were taken to hospital and two of them were in a critical condition, the state-owned RIA Novosti news agency reported.

Russia‚Äôs Investigations Committee said it had identified the attacker and was checking his psychological history. He was a local resident born in 1994, it said. No motive has been established yet. A criminal case has been launched, and investigators are verifying information on the attacker‚Äôs mental disorders, the committee said.

Gabba curator Kevin Mitchell to pull up stumps after Ashes,"The Brisbane venue has long been acclaimed for the quality of its pitches, which invariably offer pace and bounce for fast bowlers. (Source: Twitter) The Brisbane venue has long been acclaimed for the quality of its pitches, which invariably offer pace and bounce for fast bowlers. (Source: Twitter)

Long-serving Gabba curator Kevin Mitchell, who has prepared pitches at the Australian cricket fortress for over 30 years, has said he will step down after the series-opening Ashes test.

The Brisbane venue has long been acclaimed for the quality of its pitches, which invariably offer pace and bounce for fast bowlers, turn for spinners and the possibility of big totals for batting sides.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd taken a step back from the physical side of work and engaged in more of a guidance role with the team to see out my contract while helping to recruit my successor,‚Äù Mitchell told Brisbane‚Äôs Courier Mail.

‚ÄúI want to thank the grounds team for their continual efforts to meet the high standards required and maintaining the culture of having great pride in producing quality playing surfaces.‚Äù

Queensland sports minister Mick de Brenni paid tribute to Mitchell for laying the foundation for some of Australia‚Äôs most dominant performances.

‚ÄúKevin truly is an icon, and to have kept producing an absolute world-class deck on a ground that‚Äôs used all year round has taken a particular talent. So, absolutely, very, very big shoes to fill,‚Äù he said.

Mitchell learned under the wing of his father and former head groundsman Kevin Mitchell Snr, who tended the grounds from 1975-89 before being succeeded by his son.

‚ÄúThe great West Indies side were out in those days with the four big quicks and Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards and the like‚Ä¶ and I just thought, ‚Äòwhat a great place to work,'‚Äù Mitchell said in comments published by state broadcaster ABC.

‚ÄúThe Gabba is a famous, iconic, historic stadium, and you feel that responsibility to create something that Queenslanders are proud of. You have to love the job ‚Äî it‚Äôs a big part of your life.‚Äù

Australia have not lost a test at the Gabba since 1988, when they were beaten by West Indies, and only two of the last 13 matches have been draws.

Australia play the Ashes series opener on Nov. 23, four years after thrashing England at the same venue by 381 runs when left-arm seamer Mitchell Johnson took nine wickets.

England opening batsman Jonathan Trott‚Äôs struggles against the short ball at the Gabba saw him promptly exit the tour with a stress-related illness and Australia went on to whitewash England 5-0.

Andhra Pradesh first to implement Bharat QR digital payments to make Vizag less-cash city,"Bharat QR is a secure, network-agnostic interface that enables customers to use their smartphones to make payments without divulging information like card numbers and CVV. Bharat QR is a secure, network-agnostic interface that enables customers to use their smartphones to make payments without divulging information like card numbers and CVV.

Andhra Pradesh‚Äôs Eastern Power Distribution Company Ltd (EPDCL) and the Southern Power Distribution Corporation of AP Ltd (SPDCL) have become the first state-owned distribution companies in India to accept payments through Bharat QR, the world‚Äôs first interoperable quick response code acceptance solution launched by the Reserve Bank of India. As part of the ‚ÄòVizag less‚Äìcash city‚Äô initiative underway between Visa and the Andhra Pradesh government, the state has witnessed a slew of initiatives aimed at increasing the rate of digital payment adoption across the masses, Nara Lokesh, Minister of IT and Rural Development, told The Indian Express today evening.

‚ÄúWe are proud to have EPDCL and SPDCL as the flagbearers of Chief Minister Naidu‚Äôs vision to make Vizag, India‚Äôs first less‚Äìcash city and the FinTech Valley of India. Andhra Pradesh power distribution companies are setting an impressive example for discoms across India to adopt similar systems. Further, in keeping with the promotion of digital payments, we are exploring the possibility of abolishing surcharge levied to consumers on digital payments. Digitization of transactions will ultimately lead to a reduction of costs for all stakeholders involved,‚Äù he said.

T R Ramachandran, Group Country Manager, Visa, India and South Asia, said, ‚ÄúVisa got a good opportunity to steer the launch of BharatQR, that can help achieve India‚Äôs less-cash vision. A low cost acceptance solution, BharatQR has the potential to drive payment digitization at scale, and be a convenient way to pay and get paid for both consumers and merchants alike. Further, digitization of such citizen to government payments at scale, would significantly help reduce India‚Äôs net cost of cash estimated to be 1.7% of its GDP, while accelerating the country‚Äôs economic growth.‚Äù

Visa and the Government of Andhra Pradesh through the less-cash initiative, Vizag Digital Dan Sankalp, have identified electricity bill payments as an important use case for payment digitisation. Given their wide reach, recurring nature of transactions and low ticket sizes,such payments are expected to drive shift in consumer behaviour towards digital payments; in particular, among first-time users.

Bharat QR is a secure, network-agnostic interface that enables customers to use their smartphones to make payments without divulging information like card numbers and CVV. To use Bharat QR to pay their electricity bills, customers will simply need to log in to their bank‚Äôs app, and scan the QR code displayed on their electricity bill, enabling instant payment. Alternately, customers may enter their unique Customer IDs online and generate a QR code that can be scanned using their bank app.

The Vizag Digital Dhan Sankalp project is an initiative spearheaded by the Government of Andhra Pradesh and Visa, to develop Visakhapatnam into India‚Äôs first ‚Äúless‚Äìcash‚Äù city. Visa and bank partners will focus on driving the digitization for a range of key use cases determined to significantly boost the rates of cashless payments.

The initiative will aim to drive access, awareness and adoption of payments focusing on underserved merchant and consumer segments, such as small merchants and women, to educate them on the benefits of digital payments. This program is designed to enable open loop, widely scalable and non‚Äìproprietary payment solutions across state organizations to assist them in the adoption of digital payment mechanisms, and lead to cost reduction. The less cash Vizag initiative aims to transform Visakhapatnam into the FinTech Valley of India, and to serve as a dynamic example of a digitized city, on a global scale, said Lokesh Naidu.

Delhi airport to expand capacity; new runway by 2021,"The number of entry gates would be increased to 13 from 8 while the parking stands would go up to 82 from 71, among others. The number of entry gates would be increased to 13 from 8 while the parking stands would go up to 82 from 71, among others.

With rising traffic, Delhi airport operator DIAL on Tuesday said it will expand the passenger handling capacity of two operational terminals, recommission operations at terminal-2 and build a new runway by 2021. As it prepares to implement the long-term master plan that mainly focuses on meeting growing passenger numbers, DIAL has also asked airlines operating from T1 to partially shift their operations to T2 from October.

No-frills airline IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir operate from T1, which handled around 24 million passengers in 2016-17 whereas its rated capacity is 20 million passengers per annum. ‚ÄúWe have planned to increase the capacity of T1 and T3 and build a fourth runway in due course of time,‚Äù Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) CEO I Prabhakara Rao said.

As per the master plan, the capacity of T1 will be increased from 20 million to 40 million and the capacity of T3 will be increased from 34 million to 45 million, he said in a statement. Departure terminal T1D would be merged with arriving terminal T1C and then expanded to accommodate 40 million passengers per annum. A fourth runway would be constructed by 2021. ‚ÄúThis will ease out future pressure on other runways and will be constructed parallel to runway 11/29,‚Äù DIAL said.

At present, there are three runways ‚Äî 11/29, 10/28 and 9/27. The Indira Gandhi International Airport is the busiest in the country, handling 57.7 million passengers and more than 8.57 lakh tonnes of cargo in 2016-17. Taking into consideration rising passenger numbers, Rao said, ‚ÄúWe have asked the airlines operating from T1 for part shifting of operations to T2 from October‚Äù.

There is an immediate need to decongest T1 and one-third of operations need to be shifted to T2, which has been revamped with an investment of around Rs 100 crore, Rao said. Operations at T2 were stopped in 2010. Once the work is completed, operations from T2 would be shifted back to T1. After that, T2 would be demolished and a new terminal T4 will come up there, he said.

Currently, there are two operational terminals at the airport here ‚Äî T1 and T3. ‚ÄúIn the last eight months, multiple (rounds of) discussions have happened and finally, we decided that one- third of traffic should have to move to T2,‚Äù Rao said. The airlines have to decide which routes they want to offer from T2, he told reporters here, adding that shifting has to be done by October.

T3 and T2 would cater to the growing traffic in the next three to four years by which time T1 expansion project would be completed, he added. There would be a ‚Äúhuge transformation‚Äù for T1, Rao said, adding that there would be metro rail connectivity to the terminal.

Under T1 expansion plan, the area would be increased to 1,69,000 square metres from 60,000 sqm. The number of entry gates would be increased to 13 from 8 while the parking stands would go up to 82 from 71, among others. An Eastern Cross Taxiway would also be developed that would help in reducing the occupancy of the runways. This would in turn help increase the number of flight movements.

Without divulging financial details about the proposed expansion plans, Rao said work at T1 is expected to start by March next year. At present, the airport sees an average of 1,200 flight movements every day. The expansion activities are part of the master plan, which would be implemented in three phases starting from 2018 -2021 period.

The work in the second and the third phases would be done during 2021-2025 and 2026 onwards, respectively. After the 2006 master plan, there have been changes in operating conditions, including the growth of low cost carriers, growth of transfer traffic at the airport and increase in volumes of belly cargo.

Belly cargo refers to the cargo carried in the belly of an aircraft. ‚ÄúKeeping in view the unprecedented growth at Delhi airport and future infrastructure requirements, master plan 2016 has been reviewed and accordingly revised master plan 2016 has been developed,‚Äù DIAL said. DIAL is a consortium led by the GMR group. Other stakeholders are government-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Germany‚Äôs Fraport.

North Korea accuses Japan of planning cyberspace war,"North Korea Flag (File) North Korea Flag (File)

North Korea accused Japan of building a cyberspace attack force in its military under the pretext of self-defence, the media reported.

Official newspaper Rodong Sinmun on Saturday said the Japanese Defence Ministry is planning to boost the size and capability of its cyber unit under the excuse of self-defence against hackers. The members of the cyber unit will be drastically increased and a department for specializing in cyber attack capability will be set up, Xinhua news agency reported.

‚ÄúTheir cyber unit is not for merely protecting the computer system of the Self-Defence Forces (SDF) from hacking, but for attacking the computer systems of its rivals,‚Äù said the newspaper, adding that once the unit has the capability to attack, the SDF will ‚Äúcompletely turn into the force in attack formation‚Äù.

‚ÄúIf they are engrossed in war hysteria for re-invasion (of the Korean peninsula) while talking about the improvement of the so-called attacking capability, far from drawing a lesson from their crimes-woven past history, they will follow in the footsteps of their defeated predecessors,‚Äù it said.

The Japanese Defence Ministry was mulling increasing the number of soldiers in its cyber defence unit from the current 110 to 1,000, and a new working group to study cyber warfare techniques will also be established, according to media reports last month.

The initiative is part of the Japanese government‚Äôs plan to boost its cyber defence capabilities ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games.

"‚ÄòPoets are self-motivated souls, poetry is compulsion‚Äô: Kiriti Sengupta","‚ÄúYou have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words‚Äù, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) ‚ÄúYou have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words‚Äù, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)

Of all romanticism associated with poetry, the ethereal and carefree life of a poet is perhaps the most adored. But is this ‚Äî the state of a poet‚Äôs being ‚Äî the reason for the existence of poetry, and, more so, what is a poem‚Äôs purpose?

There are no wars to be won through poetry, no great intentions behind a poem‚Äôs composition and it is more of a compulsion for self-motivated souls than a mere hobby, says Kiriti Sengupta, a gifted Indian poet, who has more than 17 books of poetry to his credit.

‚ÄúI think writing poetry cannot be defined as a favourite pastime for a writer. An honest poet writes poetry out of sheer compulsion. Poets write poetry when they think it will do justice to their thoughts or expressions. There are several other ways for conveying messages, observations,and experiences, but poetry is written only when poets think they can do no better without indulging in this genre of literature,‚Äù Sengupta told IANS in an interview.

Elaborating, the much-acclaimed poet from West Bengal said that he had no ‚Äúgreat intention‚Äù when he started composing poetry and even now he does not entertain ideas of ‚Äúchanging the society‚Äù through his poems. ‚ÄúPoetry does not change anything. It does not initiate a change either. Poetry makes you think, makes you aware, and it makes you revisit your concerns, which may include your agonies as well,‚Äù he added.

Sengupta‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy Glass of Wine‚Äù is almost autobiographical and is now a part of India‚Äôs first poetry trilogy, ‚ÄúDreams of the Sacred and Ephemeral‚Äù, which also bears two other works, ‚ÄúThe Reverse Tree‚Äù and ‚ÄúHealing Waters Floating Lamps‚Äù. In the first two collections, one finds verses placed alongside prose. Sengupta stressed on the fact that he wanted to eliminate the apathy of a common reader towards poetry and thus a mix of prose and poetry was the immediate option.

But poetry is considered to be one of the finest expressions of literature and, even today, it is widely read and adored. How fulfilling is the experience of a poet then?

‚ÄúYou have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words. Whatever be your objective, if you do it well, you are happy at the end of the day. Prose writing is generally more time-consuming, but then, there are poems that, no matter if they are long or short, take days and even weeks to write and finish,‚Äù quipped the poet.

And then there is the writer‚Äôs bloc. Like all creative people, a poet is no stranger to this rather depressing phenomenon, but Sengupta says that one has to live with it as it is a part of the journey.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve my share of non-productive days when I fail to write. After publishing more than 17 books I don‚Äôt find it stressful or alarming any more. I just feel bad about it, but it is only when I read other poets‚Äô work. See, it is extremely important to keep abreast of the latest happenings in the field of poetry, especially when someone is seriously engaged in it,‚Äù he maintained.

Sengupta also contested the idea that poetry has taken a backseat in recent years and said that the reality is actually contrary to popular belief. There has been a rise in poetry consciousness across India, he said, and we have more than one organisation in every city promoting poetry among new readers, especially youngsters. It is, however, debatable whether they promote quality work and enhance the availability of quality work.

He also emphasised that it is indeed impossible ‚Äúto earn a living from writing poetry‚Äù in India. ‚ÄúPoets are self-motivated souls who write poems for the joy derived from creating a work of art,‚Äù said the poet, whose upcoming chapbook of verses is titled ‚ÄúSolitary Stillness‚Äù and is due to be published in August.

CAT 2017: This is how you need to start preparing for exam to get admission in IIMs,"CAT 2017: IIM Lucknow will be conducting the entrance examination CAT 2017: IIM Lucknow will be conducting the entrance examination

CAT 2017, which is going to be held on November 26, is now just three months away. CAT consists of three sections which are Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI & LR) and Quantitative Ability (QA). Each of these sections is allotted one hour and there are 100 questions altogether.

Important topics in each section

Quantitative Ability (QA): In QA, the majority of the questions come from algebra, number system and permutation and combination. Make sure that these topics are covered thoroughly by solving as many questions as possible from them. Getting comfortable with these topics would help you in boosting your confidence. Questions from geometry mostly have a short-cut method to solve them. Try to learn different short-cut methods to solve them while giving sectional tests.

Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC): In VARC, the majority of questions come from para-jumbles and Reading Comprehension (RC). Try to solve RC of different domains like psychology, science, economics, medicine. Getting comfortable while reading those passages from unfamiliar domains would help you in brushing up your understanding skills and help you prepare better.

Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DI & LR): LR & DI is all about practising and increasing your speed of solving. Try to sharpen up your mind by solving as many diverse questions as possible.

Keep these tips in mind while preparing for CAT 2017

Study regularly: In case you started your preparation recently, you need not worry. Instead, just focus on your preparation, without getting stressed out. Make sure that you study on a regular basis. It is important to study a minimum of 3-4 hours per day. In case you are doing a job along with your preparation, try to cut down on your sleep at night and study during that period.

Balance speed and accuracy: CAT is about balancing accuracy and speed at the same time which can be achieved only through maximum practice. In the initial phase of your preparation, try to focus more on accuracy rather than speed. Gradually, with time, try to increase your speed keeping your accuracy constant. Do not just focus on one section and prepare for that. It is important to solve questions of every section on a daily basis. It helps in keeping the speed and comfort with all the topics intact.

Cover all topics: Leaving out certain topics for CAT might not be a good strategy. You may lose out on an opportunity to score easy marks. In case you want to leave any topic during preparation, make sure that the topic should is not a very important one, for example, para-jumbles or permutation & combination.

Understand your strong and weak areas by giving sectional mocks: Since every section has its own cut-off, therefore it is important to know your strong and weak areas. In case you have just started your preparation, for the next couple of weeks, work on your concepts and understand them thoroughly. Also, give sectional mocks of these topics to understand how well acquainted you are with those topics. Just giving sectional mocks won‚Äôt help you a lot. It is even more important to see the solutions and analyse your performance and learn from your mistakes.

Attempt full-length mocks: The same thing goes for full-length mocks as well, where just giving too many mocks isn‚Äôt the best way to prepare. A substantial amount of time should be given to the analysis of those mocks. Also, the learning from those mocks should be absorbed and they should be carried forward into the next mock. You can practice sectional and full-length mocks on the gradeup app.

Look for the simplest method: At times, there are multiple ways to solve the same question. Try to solve the question by the shortest method using tricks and short-cuts. Make sure that you keep those tricks in mind for future use. Just solving a question by using a long method doesn‚Äôt do any good.

Take small breaks in between: It is sometimes necessary to take breaks in-between study while practising. This helps you to freshen up your mind and improve your efficiency.

Make a weekly study plan: Make a thirteen-week study plan in which the first six weeks should focus more on concept building and giving sectional mocks. The next seven weeks should focus more on giving full-length mocks and analysing them in detail. This would include working on your weak areas and making sure that you develop a certain level of comfort with those topics.

Sincere and dedicated efforts along with a smart study plan during these 3 months will surely help you get a seat in your dream B-school.

Major realty projects to get environment nod in Mumbai,"Separate from an environment department which studied environmental problems ‚Äî and was discarded by the BMC last year ‚Äî this cell will only look at ECs. Separate from an environment department which studied environmental problems ‚Äî and was discarded by the BMC last year ‚Äî this cell will only look at ECs.

Major real estate projects in Mumbai will now get environment clearance (EC) in Mumbai itself. The newly set up environment cell of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will grant EC to real estate projects admeasuring 20,000 square metre to 1,50,000 square metres.

Prior to this, a State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), constituted by the Centre under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, was responsible for the environment impact assessment (EIA) notification and take decisions on ECs. Now, this will be manned by the BMC‚Äôs environment cell, only for Mumbai.

No-objection certificates (NOCs) or clearances are required under environment impact notification (required for projects spanning over 20,000 square metres to 1,50,000 square metre), which takes around seven to nine months, and the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance that takes four to six months. The process will now be faster, claim BMC officials.

The Centre last year issued a notification allowing local bodies to process building proposals for environment clearances, as part of the ‚Äòease of doing business‚Äô initiative.‚ÄúThe cell will assess and appraise environmental concerns of the area under its jurisdiction. It will monitor the environment audit process by auditors and carry out random checks to verify compliance with environmental conditions,‚Äù said Sanjay Darade, chief engineer, development Plan department.

Separate from an environment department which studied environmental problems ‚Äî and was discarded by the BMC last year ‚Äî this cell will only look at ECs. The cell consists of three BMC officers who are experts in waste management (solid and liquid), water conservation and management, and transport planning and management. Three other members of the cell are former BMC officers. They will focus on fields such as environment planning including air quality management, energy efficiency, and resource efficiency including building materials.

Eyeing her third title at Badminton World Championships, Carolina Marin said she is better prepared than Rio 2016 Olympics, where she won gold after beating India‚Äôs PV Sindhu in the final, and will fight for gold in Glasgow.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been two months of preparation; I‚Äôve prepared better than I had before the Rio Olympics,‚Äù Marin told reporters in Glasgow.

‚ÄúMy main aim is to fight for gold. I have some tough matches coming up but I‚Äôm not thinking of the title defence. I will take it match by match.‚Äù

After the Rio high, Marin had to deal with thigh injury and conceded two walkovers during the period. She failed to win a title and saw her ranking dip to the number four position.

‚ÄúThe Olympics was a year ago. I have to forget that. After the Olympics, I had some injuries and couldn‚Äôt do well and it was frustrating. Now I‚Äôm playing well again,‚Äù said the former World No. 1.

Seeded third at Badminton World Championships, the Spaniard got a bye in the opening round and will commence her campaign against the winner of the match between Hong Kong‚Äôs Yip Pui Yin and Russia‚Äôs Natalia Perminova in the second round.

UK to release tranche of Brexit position papers,"Britain‚Äôs Brexit department said on Sunday it would issue two formal position papers this week along with a batch of proposals for discussions on future relations ahead of the next round of negotiations scheduled for later this month. Britain‚Äôs Brexit department said on Sunday it would issue two formal position papers this week along with a batch of proposals for discussions on future relations ahead of the next round of negotiations scheduled for later this month.

Britain will issue a cluster of new papers this week to outline its strategy positions in divorce talks with the European Union, ranging from regulation of goods to data protection, the UK‚Äôs Brexit department said on Sunday. Prime Minister Theresa May‚Äôs government wants to push discussions with the EU beyond a focus on settling divorce arrangements to its future relationship with the bloc to bring clarity to anxious businesses, citizens and investors.

Last week, Britain issued proposals for a future customs agreement with the EU and a solution for Northern Ireland to avoid a return of border posts with the Republic of Ireland which might inflame tensions. Britain‚Äôs Brexit department said on Sunday it would issue two formal position papers this week along with a batch of proposals for discussions on future relations ahead of the next round of negotiations scheduled for later this month.

‚ÄúIn the coming days we will demonstrate our thinking even further, with five new papers ‚Äì all part of our work to drive the talks forward, and make sure we can show beyond doubt that we have made sufficient progress on withdrawal issues by October so that we can move on to discuss our future relationship,‚Äù Britain‚Äôs Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement.

TIGHT TIMETABLE

In July, the EU‚Äôs top Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said talks on future relations had become less likely to start in October because of a lack of progress on issues such as how much Britain should pay to leave the EU, the future rights of British and EU citizens, and how to manage a land border in Ireland.

EU officials said progress had been difficult because Britain had no position at all on many issues and that an already-tight timetable could be delayed ahead of the scheduled March 2019 exit. The release of a swathe of papers this week underlines Britain‚Äôs desire to counter that criticism.

One will be a technical paper dealing with services associated with the production, sale and distribution of goods, along with their operation and repair, which Britain‚Äôs Brexit department said should form part of the exit negotiations.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically about ensuring that when we leave there isn‚Äôt a situation where goods on the market that have been validated and checked, all of sudden we have a need for businesses to have to go through compliance checks,‚Äù a spokesman said.

In another, the government will say it is important to establish a framework on confidentiality to ensure the current system for exchanging official documents is protected.

Further papers on the future relationship will be released outlining the UK‚Äôs plans for civil judicial cooperation with the EU, dispute resolution in light of Britain‚Äôs intention to end the European Court of Justice‚Äôs jurisdiction over British matters, and on data protection.

Millions of Americans to gaze upon Monday‚Äôs once-in-a-lifetime solar eclipse,"Fourth graders at Clardy Elementary School in Kansas City, Mo. practice the proper use of their eclipse glasses in anticipation of Monday‚Äôs solar eclipse.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)

Twilight will fall at midday on Monday, stars will glimmer and birds will roost in an eerie stillness as millions of Americans and visitors witness the first total solar eclipse to traverse the United States from coast to coast in 99 years. The sight of the moon‚Äôs shadow passing directly in front of the sun, blotting out all but the halo-like solar corona, may draw the largest live audience for a celestial event in human history. When those watching via broadcast and online media are factored into the mix, the spectacle will likely smash records. ‚ÄúIt will certainly be the most observed total eclipse in history,‚Äù astronomer Rick Fienberg of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) said last week.

The eclipse begins its cross-country trajectory over the Pacific Coast of Oregon in late morning. It will reach South Carolina‚Äôs Atlantic shore some 90 minutes later. The total eclipse of the sun is considered one of the most spell-binding phenomena in nature but it rarely occurs over a wide swath of land, let alone one of the world‚Äôs most heavily populated countries at the height of summer. In terms of audience potential, it is hard to top the United States, with its mobile and affluent population, even though the direct path is mostly over rural areas, towns and small cities. The largest is Nashville, Tennessee, a city of 660,000 residents.

Even so the advent of social media and inexpensive high-tech optics have boosted public awareness, assuring what many U.S. experts predict will be unprecedented viewership for the so-called ‚ÄúGreat American Eclipse.‚Äù Some might take issue with that prediction, citing a solar eclipse visible over parts of India, Nepal, Bangladesh and central China in July 2009. National Geographic estimated 30 million people in Shanghai and Hangzhou alone were in its path that day.

On Monday, the deepest part of the shadow, or umbra, cast by the moon will fall over a 70-mile-wide (113-km-wide), 2,500-mile-long (4,000-km-long) ‚Äúpath of totality‚Äù traversing 14 states. The 12 million people who live there can view the eclipse at its fullest merely by walking outside and looking up, weather permitting. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2fNQHFb)

LIVESTREAMING AND PRICE-GOUGING

Some 200 million Americans reside within a day‚Äôs drive of the totality zone, and as many as 7 million, experts say, are expected to converge on towns and campgrounds along the narrow corridor for the event. Many are attending multiday festivals featuring music, yoga and astronomy lectures. Millions more could potentially watch in real time as the eclipse is captured by video cameras mounted on 50 high-altitude balloons and streamed online in a joint project between NASA and Montana State University. A partial eclipse will appear throughout North America.

Adding further to the excitement is the wide availability of affordable solar-safe sunglasses produced by the millions and selling so fast that suppliers were running out of stock. The owner of one leading manufacturer reported price gouging by second-hand dealers who were buying up large supplies and reselling them over the internet at a huge mark-up.

Not all the hoopla will unfold on dry land. Welsh pop singer Bonnie Tyler is slated to perform her 1983s hit single ‚ÄúTotal Eclipse of the Heart‚Äù aboard a cruise liner as the vessel sails into the path of totality from Florida on Monday. Back on the ground, forest rangers, police and city managers in the total eclipse zone are bracing for a crush of travelers they fear will cause epic traffic jams and heighten wildfire hazards.

‚ÄúImagine 20 Woodstock festivals occurring simultaneously across the nation,‚Äù Michael Zeiler, an AAS advisory panel member wrote on his website, GreatAmericanEclipse.com, referring to the famously chaotic 1969 outdoor rock extravaganza in upstate New York. Hundreds of residents in a prime-viewing area in Oregon had to evacuate on Saturday under threat from a wildfire raging in the Deschutes National Forest, according to InciWeb fire-tracking website.

The so-called Milli Fire, which has scorched more than 7,8OO acres (3,162 hectare), is one of seven burning in Oregon, Montana and Idaho, three of the states crossed by the totality path. Zeiler, an avowed ‚Äúeclipse chaser‚Äù who made the 650-mile (1,046-km) drive from his New Mexico home to Wyoming for a choice view, said South Carolina is likely to see the greatest influx as the destination state closest to the entire U.S. Eastern seaboard. Monday‚Äôs event will be the first total solar eclipse spanning the entire continental United States since 1918 and the first visible anywhere in the lower 48 states in 38 years. The next one over North America is due in just seven years, in April 2024.

Henrik Stenson closes with 64 to win at Wyndham Championship,"Henrik Stenson earned ,044,000 and 500 FedEx Cup points for his sixth win on tour. (Source: AP) Henrik Stenson earned ,044,000 and 500 FedEx Cup points for his sixth win on tour. (Source: AP)

Henrik Stenson kept making birdies on the back nine Sunday at the Wyndham Championship. They added up to a tournament record and his first victory of the year.

Stenson closed with a 6-under 64 for a one-stroke victory in the final event of the PGA Tour regular season. The 2013 FedEx Cup champion finished at 22-under 258 at Sedgefield Country Club, breaking the course‚Äôs 72-hole record set by Carl Pettersson in 2008 and matched last year by Si Woo Kim.

The Swede earned $1,044,000 and 500 FedEx Cup points for his sixth win on tour and his first since the 2016 British Open. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly a good time to start firing,‚Äù Stenson said. ‚ÄúWe know the kind of damage you can do in the playoffs. ‚Ä¶ If you get hot and keep on playing well, you have a chance to challenge.‚Äù

Stenson said he left his driver in his locker all week ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a little anxious to get out there and start getting some air time next week,‚Äù he quipped of the club and certainly didn‚Äôt need it on the par-70 Sedgefield course.

For the second straight day, he had four birdies in a five-hole stretch of the back nine. Ollie Schniederjans shot a 64 to finish second. Webb Simpson was 18 under after a 67.‚Äù

‚ÄúI had to keep on making birdies,‚Äù Stenson said, ‚Äúbecause Ollie was surely not backing down.

Stenson had three consecutive birdies on Nos. 15-17 leaving a 20-foot eagle putt on the 15th hole about a foot short after he and Schniederjans were both at 19 under.

Stenson‚Äôs 30-foot birdie putt on No. 17 moved him to 22 under. He needed it, because Schniederjans kept the pressure on him. The 24-year-old former Georgia Tech player made a 40-foot birdie putt on No. 17 and added another birdie on the par-4 18th hole after placing his second shot 2 feet from the pin.

‚ÄúI thought I had a two-shot cushion ‚Ä¶ and as I walked over (to the 18th hole and) looked around, `Oh, OK, (Schniederjans) birdied it as well,‚Äù Stenson said. ‚ÄúSo I better scramble a par here to get the win.‚Äù

With Schniederjans watching the television broadcast and hoping for a tie, Stenson rolled a 35-foot birdie putt on No. 18 off the right edge of the cup, then made a 3-footer to end it.

‚ÄúWhen I stuffed it (on No. 18), I thought that‚Äôs probably going to be a playoff,‚Äù Schniederjans said. ‚ÄúAnd he birdied 17 and got par on 18. Hat‚Äôs off to him he had a great finish, too. Just one short.‚Äù

Low scores and tight leaderboards once again were the norm at Sedgefield. With seven holes left for the final pairing, four players Stenson, Schniederjans, Ryan Armour and Kevin Na shared the lead at 18 under.

‚ÄúIt was anyone‚Äôs tournament on the back nine,‚Äù Stenson said. Stenson moved to 19 under with a birdie on the 13th and Schniederjans joined him with a remarkable recovery for birdie on the 15th. His second shot careened off a canopy covering the gallery and landed in a greenside bunker, but he chipped to 2 feet of the flagstick and converted the putt.

The other subplot at Sedgefield was the push by the bubble players to qualify for the playoffs that start next week at The Northern Trust for the top 125 on the points list. Geoff Ogilvy, who was at No. 125, finished at 11 under and earned enough points to move to No. 116.

And Martin Flores, who started at No. 139, jumped to No. 118 and made the playoffs for the first time since 2014 after a 63 highlighted by a hole-in-one on the par-3 16th. J.J. Henry, Harold Varner III and Rory Sabbatini also played their way into the top 125.

‚ÄúI was very aware of where I was all day but I knew that I needed to be somewhere inside the top 10, have to,‚Äù Flores said. ‚ÄúSo I was able to get off to a great start and I was able to just keep it going all day.‚Äù

DIVOTS: Ben Crane was the first player this week to ace the 16th hole, earning 1 million rewards points from the tournament‚Äôs title sponsor. ‚ÄúBilly Horschel and I did a lot of choreography work beforehand and nailed it, did the right high fives,‚Äù Crane said about his post-ace celebration.

"Nineties, Unplugged!","Alisha Chinai rose to fame with her song ‚ÄúMade In India‚Äù, which is still remembered by fans everywhere. Alisha Chinai rose to fame with her song ‚ÄúMade In India‚Äù, which is still remembered by fans everywhere.

In november 2015, of the 60,000 people who had gathered at London‚Äôs Wembley Stadium to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a rally-cum-reception, many didn‚Äôt recognise the singer dressed in an ivory lehenga, who came on stage just ahead of the PM‚Äôs address. But they soon did. As composer Biddu‚Äôs popular synth prelude began playing and the artiste began to croon, the crowd erupted in loud cheer and chants of ‚ÄúEk dil chahiye that‚Äôs made in India‚Äù. It was then that Alisha Chinai, pop icon of the Nineties, knew that she was far from forgotten. ‚ÄúThat song has been my identity for a really long time.

All I need to do is sing ‚ÄòMade in India‚Äô and people follow,‚Äù says the singer, with a laugh over a telephone conversation from her south Mumbai apartment. Chinai, among the earliest of Indipop stars in the country, burst on to the scene in 1995, on the back of her successful playback stint in Bollywood ‚Äî Kate nahi kat te for Shekhar Kapur‚Äôs Mr India ‚Äî with a music video that featured supermodel Milind Soman. Made in India married western beats to Indian sounds, creating a fusion that was both different and catchy. Chinai would be dubbed the Indian Madonna and go on to spawn a generation of pop artistes who aspired to make music differently. ‚ÄúPeople still listened to international stars such as Michael Jackson, Backstreet Boys and Aqua, but now, there were a bunch of musicians singing of our experiences in Hindi and that appealed to people,‚Äù says musician Leslie Lewis, 58, who had composed many pop songs of the time.

The Nineties were an interesting time to be a musician in India. After liberalisation, the scope of private and foreign investments scaled up, paving the way for the entry of foreign broadcasters such as MTV and Channel V in the country. These gave people a taste of contemporary music from across the world, from a range of artists such as Madonna, Whigfield and bands like Shakespears Sister and Michael Learns to Rock. There was an explosion of choices and a talented bunch of artistes grasped it with both hands. Suneeta Rao, known for her song Pari Hoon Main (1991), says, ‚ÄúWe all knocked on the doors of music producers, but we wanted to do more than just playback music. Bollywood didn‚Äôt have space for people who thought clearly and boldly and wanted to do something different. That industry only wanted a certain kind of voice, a particular pitch. It was either for a heroine or a vamp, nothing in between,‚Äù says Mumbai-based Rao, who now does live shows and writes music.

The Nineties were also a time to experiment. There was Shweta Shetty dressed in a man‚Äôs suit, singing about Johnny Joker, her red lipstick as unmistakable as her deep, husky voice, in a Ken Ghosh video. Daler Mehendi gave bhangra a twist and got his audience to go Tara rara with him. While Jasbir Jassi, a young wedding singer from a pind in Punjab, sang of being thrilled about his heart being stolen by a girl from Gujarat (Dil le gayi kudi), Bally Sagoo was adding slick beats to Malkit Singh‚Äôs Aaja nach le and Gud naal ishq mittha, a song that still brings back memories of the Malaika Arora and Jas Arora video. If Colonial Cousins, comprising Hariharan and Lewis, were introducing pop to us with a touch of the classical, Shubha Mudgal‚Äôs Ab ke saawan was taking classical music to the masses. Falguni Pathak found success with Yaad piya ki aane lagi, a folk-based pop album, and, would go on to become a staple at dandiyas, while Anamika Grover turned an RD Burman ditty, Kahin karta hoga, into bubblegum pop. If Mehnaz aspired to be a beauty queen in Banoongi main Miss India, the Aryans sang of teenage love with songs such as Aankhon mein tera hi chehra.

The foundation of this success, however, was laid a decade ago ‚Äî when the Pakistani brother-sister duo Nazia and Zoheb Hassan became the toast of South Asia with Disco Deewane (1981). ‚ÄúDisco Deewane sold 100,000 records within a day of its release in Mumbai. Without any internet, without the kind of marketing systems that exist today, it was a paradigm shift for the music industry. People were interested in music that was hip and their own pop by virtue of being in their own language,‚Äù says Zoheb in a conversation from London, where he settled down after the death of his sister in 2000.

This new sound was also markedly different from what Bollywood was producing at the time. Apart from AR Rahman (Roja, Dil Se) and a few soundtracks from Jatin-Lalit (Lamhe, Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge), Bollywood, says British-Indian music producer Bally Sagoo, ‚Äúwas producing really mediocre stuff and that‚Äôs why there was such a spurt in interesting non-film music‚Äù. Sagoo, who began making music in Birmingham after being inspired by hip hop and reggae, was among the earliest to cash in on the trend. Merging Western beats with Punjabi folk, he came up with upbeat numbers that have become staple at clubs and wedding parties. ‚ÄúFor the first time, people realised that you could have a music video and it didn‚Äôt have to be attached to a film. That awareness, and consequently, the investments in music videos and the presentation of the artistes that followed changed how one perceived singers. They became performers,‚Äù says Sagoo, 53, who is remembered for a reworked version of Asha Bhosle‚Äôs Chura liya hai (1996),the Punjabi pop hit Aaja nach le (1998) and for his remix of Lata Mangeshkar‚Äôs Noorie for Gurinder Chaddha‚Äôs Bend It Like Beckham (2002). His compositions and remixes were also in Mira Nair‚Äôs Monsoon Wedding (2001) and Mistress of Spices (2005). Now, primarily, a music producer for the UK and US markets, Sagoo was presented the inaugural trophy for outstanding achievement by Spice Girls at UK Asian Awards, 2003.

By the mid-2000s, however, Indipop‚Äôs glory days were fading and the focus was shifting once again to Bollywood. ‚ÄúIt was hard to keep up with Bollywood. They had the infrastructure and the resources. Once they caught on to the formula, everything and everyone eventually got absorbed by it. Those who couldn‚Äôt keep up, left and looked for alternate careers,‚Äù says 47-year-old Jasbir Jassi. Sonu Nigam, who had delivered a brilliant album like Deewana (2003) and Shaan, a Tanha Dil (2000), went on to have successful careers as playback singers. ‚ÄúIt was necessary to adapt to Bollywood‚Äôs ways because either you toed the line or they would hire someone else to replace you,‚Äù says Jassi.

Bollywood‚Äôs ascendancy would also spell bad news for music companies such as Magnasound and Polygram that had been launch pads for so many pop artistes. The record labels had begun investing more than they could chew. ‚ÄúI heard that for Daler Mehendi, who was paid Rs 2 lakh for his first successful album (Bolo Ta Ra Ra, 1995) that sold almost 75 lakh copies, the amount was increased to Rs 2 crore for the next one. It ended up with approximately 50 lakh copies sold. The profits weren‚Äôt as big and the companies began to lose money,‚Äù says Jai Walia of the Aryans.

The arrival of the internet would sound an emphatic death knell for Indipop. Most music companies couldn‚Äôt keep up and went out of business. ‚ÄúMusic labels tried to create paid content for a while for musicians who wanted to find a footing in Bollywood. Many of these artistes were musicians who had had their moment, but for music channels and record labels to survive, they needed more than that,‚Äù says yesteryear pop star Anaida of Nazuk Nazuk fame. It was only a matter of time before MTV‚Äôs content would be dominated by reality shows such as Roadies and Splitsvilla. While Channel V veered away from music, MTV India had a brief moment of rejuvenation with Coke Studio India, MTV Unplugged and MTV Indies, but it was too little too late.

The internet may have hit the industry hard, but, over time, it has also helped some artistes turn their fortunes around. Chinai after having delivered monster hits such as Kajrare from the 2007 film Bunty Aur Babli and a forgettable outing with Krishh 2 (2013), is now trying to harness the power of the social media to release a couple of songs on YouTube. ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôve had my head buried in the sand, but, as an artiste, I am clear that one can‚Äôt die with the song inside. I don‚Äôt believe in numbers. I want to do quality work and perform once in a while. That way, one doesn‚Äôt get burnt out. That‚Äôs probably part of the reason that every time I come back, there is a certain amount of freshness. I‚Äôm known to be a hitmaker,‚Äù says Chinai, who says her fight for royalties in Bollywood has left her far from satisfied.

Shweta Shetty, another Magnasound artiste, worked as a playback artiste for a while before marriage took her to Germany in 1997. Shetty has spent the last decade learning the ropes of opera while travelling with English classical soprano and actor, Sarah Brightman (known for her productions Cats and Phantom of the Opera). When the two met, Brightman was married to musical theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber and had collaborated with Shetty in the album Harem (2004), a combination of operatic vocals and Middle-eastern sounds. Shetty returned to India last year and unsurprisingly, played a man‚Äôs role ‚Äî Shylock ‚Äî in a version of The Merchant of Venice, called Reth ‚Äî Songs of the Sand, directed by Satyabrata Rout. ‚ÄúI want to cater to an audience that does not know of my existence. This young audience is well travelled, intelligent, has access to various genres of music. I think they are ready for the opera,‚Äù says Shetty, 48.

Anaida, the half-Indian and half-Iranian singer who came under the spotlight at 15 with her teen album, Hotline, has turned chef and entertainment consultant. ‚ÄúI got out of pop music when the scene got a little crazy and when Bollywood and the internet began edging Indipop out. I had the first mover‚Äôs advantage and I wanted to harness my interest and expertise in food to profitable ends,‚Äù says the 37-year-old, who is the chef/partner at SodaBottleOpenerwala in Mumbai‚Äôs Powai and focuses on authentic Persian cuisine. ‚ÄúThe digitisation of music has actually helped people like me. Some days, I write and compose five trance/dance tracks. My Swedish producers put it online the same day and likeminded people just follow it. You don‚Äôt even have to advertise,‚Äù says Anaida, who has recently completed an album on Rumi, that is being mixed in LA by Grammy-nominated producer Luigie Gonzales. Like her, Walia, too, is preparing to launch his cafe in Delhi‚Äôs Punjabi Bagh, where he will have a live music space for struggling musicians. He has also moved completely away from pop, choosing instead to cut an album of ghazals that will be released soon online.

Anamika Grover, who shot to fame with her remixes, is planning to follow in Chinai‚Äôs footsteps and release a Punjabi album titled Chak De Dhol online. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a record company anymore as long as you create your own music and put yourself out there,‚Äù she says. The internet‚Äôs already given her a fan following in the north Indian wedding market and the NRI crowd ‚Äî Grover spends a few months every year overseas, performing at NRI weddings and at Navratri celebrations, where her chartbusters Kala sha kala and Kahin karta hoga still remain the most requested numbers. Does she miss the kind of popularity she once commandeered? ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say I am disillusioned. My fans are spread across the globe. I am making good money. It‚Äôs only how I work that has changed,‚Äù she says.

Tune into the popular soundscape online and among the handful of Indian ‚Äúpop‚Äù videos floating around on YouTube, very few make the cut. Neha Bhasin‚Äôs work, in particular, her modern takes on Punjabi folk songs of Surinder and Prakash Kaur, however, touch a chord. ‚ÄúI have grown up watching Indipop. That was why I participated in a reality music competition to form the first girl band in India (Viva). Now, more than anything else, I want to be a pop icon for my personal satisfaction. They say internet killed the pop stars, now I am trying to use it to set myself up as one. It‚Äôs time to get the swagger back,‚Äù says Bhasin.

Iran, accused of supporting Shiite Huthi rebels in Yemen, ‚Äúis part of the problem, not the solution‚Äù when it comes to ending conflict in the war-torn nation, Yemen‚Äôs top diplomat has said.

‚ÄúIran is the cause of the problem, Iran continues to support the Huthis, Iranian arms are smuggled. Iran is part of the problem, not the solution,‚Äù Foreign Minister Abdulmalik al-Mekhlafi said when asked if Tehran could contribute to a political solution in Yemen. He was speaking at UN headquarters after a major luncheon hosted by Yemen and Saudi Arabia with the majority of diplomatic missions to the United Nations.

‚ÄúIran has no role to play in the region,‚Äù echoed the Saudi ambassador to the United Nations, Abdallah Al-Mouallimi. Saudi humanitarian aid to Yemen is estimated to top 8.2 billion dollars.The Saudi-led military coalition largely controls the country‚Äôs airspace, although US drones also carry out strikes on suspected Al-Qaeda bases there. More than 8,300 people have been killed and 44,000 wounded since the Saudi-led coalition entered the Yemen war in 2015.

Close to 2,000 Yemenis have also died of cholera since April and another 600,000 are expected to contract the infection this year.

Out of this number, 488 qualified and 991 students remained unsuccessful. (Representational Image)

SEVERAL students who excelled in PSEB‚Äôs Class 10 exam have failed to clear the entrance test for Punjab‚Äôs prestigious nine Meritorious Schools despite being given a second change. The first entrance test was held in June, and the second in August first week. In the second entrance exam, 1442 seats, which were left after first entrance result, were to be filled. Total 1479 students took the exam on August 2, majority of them re-appearing for the test. Out of this number, 488 qualified and 991 students remained unsuccessful. The total seats vacant in these schools this year now stand at 954. Only students scoring more than 80 per cent marks in Class X are eligible to sit in CET (Combined Entrance Test).

The schools were opened by the previous SAD-BJP government in 2014, and seats have remained vacant since the very first batch (2014-15). Former Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal had called these schools his dream project where free senior secondary education to poor meritorious students is provided along with facilities, including hostel, food, books, uniforms and free extra coaching for competitive exams.

Barring the first year, clearing the entrance exam has been a must to get admission in these schools. Last year more than 400 seats had remained vacant. This year for 4100 seats, total 4919 students appeared during ‚Äòfirst entrance‚Äô held in June, out of which 2658 students cracked the exam, while 2261 students remained unsuccessful to score 50 per cent marks in aggregate and 33 per cent in individual subjects to needed to qualify. The test was conducted for three subjects including English, Math and Science, based on Class 10 syllabus. For 4100 seats, around 10,000 students of government schools were eligible for CET this year.

A Meritorious School principal said that the result revealed the state of education in government schools. He also pointed out use of unfair means to score better in Class X exams. ‚ÄúSetting up of big schools would not take us to anywhere,‚Äù said renowned educationist and retired Circle Education Officer (CEO), BS Bhatia. Vice President BEd Teacher Front Punjab, Chander Shekhar, said: ‚ÄúMeritorious schools are good because they provide good platform to the students. Several students are getting selected in prestigious engineering exams too, but same level of education must be provided in all the government schools of the state.‚Äù

When contacted, Director General School Education (DGSE) Parshant Goyal, admitted that seats remain vacant in these schools every year despite large number of meritorious students from Class 10 qualifying for entrance test.

‚ÄúWe are checking entire process and will make necessary changes from next academic session as there is no point of leaving hundreds of seats vacants in these schools,‚Äù he said. Six Meritorious Schools were opened in 2014-15 in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Mohali, Patiala, Bathinda and Amritsar with 3,000 seats ‚Äì 500 each for Class 11 and 12 in Non-medical, medical and commerce streams. Currently, the number these schools is nine.

"Libya‚Äôs former PM Ali Zeidan kidnapped in Tripoli, say family members","Since Kadhafi‚Äôs fall, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have been obliged to depend on rival militias that are battling for control of the North African country. Since Kadhafi‚Äôs fall, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have been obliged to depend on rival militias that are battling for control of the North African country.

Libya‚Äôs former prime minister Ali Zeidan has been kidnapped by an armed group in war-torn Tripoli and not been heard from in nine days, family members and friends said today. Zeidan, who became premier in November 2012, was dismissed by Libya‚Äôs parliament in March 2014 amid accusations that public funds had been embezzled. He left the country soon afterwards, in defiance of a travel ban issued by the attorney general.

Zeidan had returned to Libya in early August for the first time since his dismissal and was planning a Tripoli press conference to respond to his critics, according to Karam Khaled, a friend who accompanied him. He said the former premier‚Äôs visit had been coordinated with Fayez al-Sarraj, premier in the country‚Äôs United Nations-backed Government of National Accord.

‚ÄúIt was the GNA that prepared the visit, including protocol at the airport and the hotel reservation,‚Äù Khaled said. He said an armed group‚Äôs first attempt to seize Zeidan on August 12 was foiled by hotel guards.

He said the gunmen were from the GNA-linked Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade, a militia of former rebels from the NATO-backed 2011 uprising that led to the overthrow and killing of longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi. ‚ÄúGunmen from the same group returned the next day and we were obliged to hand them Zeidan,‚Äù Khaled said.

‚ÄúSince then, we have had no information on where he is being held or his condition,‚Äù he said, criticising the ‚Äúsilence‚Äù of the unity government. The ex-prime minister‚Äôs son Zeidan Zeidan said the family had no news of his father‚Äôs whereabouts. ‚ÄúWe have nothing so far,‚Äù he said by phone from the United Arab Emirates, where he lives.

He said his father‚Äôs lawyer had told him no court cases had been brought against the former premier. ‚ÄúThis was indeed a kidnapping and not an arrest,‚Äù he said, adding that the family is worried for the health of his father, who is 67.

In October 2013, gunmen seized the then premier from Tripoli‚Äôs luxury Corinthia Hotel, but he was released after several hours. Since Kadhafi‚Äôs fall, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have been obliged to depend on rival militias that are battling for control of the North African country.

Young entrepreneurs must become ‚Äòsoldiers of development‚Äô: PM Modi,"PM Modi addressing CEOs and Start ups in the national capital. PM Modi addressing CEOs and Start ups in the national capital.

Calling young entrepreneurs to become ‚Äòsoldiers of development‚Äô, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged people to work towards country‚Äôs growth. Addressing CEOs and Start ups at Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra in Delhi, Modi said, for a government, the welfare and happiness of people is supreme. ‚ÄúIn Government, the welfare of the people and the happiness of citizens is supreme. Every citizen must have a feeling that this country is mine and I have to work for the country, I want to add something towards its growth,‚Äù said Modi.

He mentioned Mahatama Gandhi‚Äôs freedom struggle that united the nation and said India needs a movement like the one started by Father of Nation. ‚ÄúMahatma Gandhi turned the freedom struggle into a mass movement and we saw the results. Every person wanted India to be free but Gandhi ji did something unique. He made every person feel he or she is working for the nation. In the same spirit as what Mahatma Gandhi did for the freedom struggle, we need to make India‚Äôs development a mass movement,‚Äù said Modi.

Stressing that India needs to move towards becoming a less cash society, he asked the CEOs to encourage the use of BHIM app for cashless transactions and ensure by 2022 that employees working for them go cashless. He also asked them to distribute Khadi coupons as Diwali gifts.

Referring to tourism and enormous potential in job creations, Modi said: ‚ÄúWe Indians don‚Äôt take pride in our rich heritage. If we begin talking about it with pride, the world will desperate to visit India.‚Äù He said he was looking at end-to-end solutions for India. ‚ÄúIf this generation thinks of feasible solutions to our unique problems, markets and jobs will automatically be created,‚Äù he added.

On various initiatives of his government, Modi talked about GeM (Government-e-Market) portal which was introduced recently to increase transparency in government purchases. He said even small suppliers can sell their products to the government through the portal.

As many as 28,000 small suppliers have sold their products to government worth Rs 1,000 crore through the portal in the last 4-6 months.

Calling the young CEOs as his team, Modi said India‚Äôs development must be made a mass movement and entrepreneurs should think of what more they can do for the country‚Äôs growth and for the poor.

He asked them to provide policy inputs and be the harbinger for change. For the government, he said, welfare of its citizens and their happiness is supreme.

The Prime Minister stressed on the need to focus on export oriented agri products, saying that innovative ideas like cultivating timber on fringes of farm land would help achieve the goal of doubling farmers‚Äô income.

He regretted that around Rs 1 lakh crore of agri products ‚Äì from fruits to vegetables ‚Äì go waste because of lack of infrastructure. Creating infrastructure in itself is a business opportunity, he added.

IIMC deemed university status idea to be studied by new UGC panel,"The IIMC has expanded from two campuses in Delhi and Dhenkanal to six campuses across the country. The IIMC has expanded from two campuses in Delhi and Dhenkanal to six campuses across the country.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) has set up a panel to study a proposal to grant deemed university status to the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC). The IIMC, one of the prestigious journalism schools in the country which functions under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, offers diploma courses in journalism, advertising and public relations.

According to a senior HRD Ministry official, the four- member committee, which will analyse the proposal by the IIMC, will be headed by BK Kuthiala, the vice-chancellor of Makhanlal Chaturvedi University, Bhopal.

‚ÄúThe other members are Sanjay Wadwalkar, Chairman of Panjab University‚Äôs School of Communication; G Ravindran ‚Äì HOD of the University of Madras‚Äô School of Journalism and Sunita Siwach from the UGC,‚Äù the official said.

The panel will submit its recommendation after examining the proposal and the UGC will then form another committee which will conduct site visits, the official added. The idea to grant deemed university status to the IIMC is not a new one. The Information and Broadcasting Ministry had also approved the plan last year.

‚ÄúUGC forming a committee to study the idea is an indicator that things are moving steadily. Once the university status is granted, the institution will also expand in the academic sector rather than just being an industry oriented school,‚Äù IIMC Director General KG Suresh said.

The IIMC has expanded from two campuses in Delhi and Dhenkanal to six campuses across the country ‚Äî Jammu, Amravati, Kottayam and Aizawl being the new ones ‚Äî over the last five years. During a review of higher education institutes by the Niti Aayog in June, it was recommended that the IIMC be merged with either Jawaharlal Nehru University‚Äôa Centre for Media Studies or Jamia Millia Islamia‚Äôs AJK Mass Communication Research Centre.

However, the institute as well as the Information and Broadcasting and HRD ministries had rejected the idea.

Aaron Mooy strikes as buoyant Huddersfield edge Newcastle,"Aaron Mooy scored for Huddersfield in the 50th minute. (Source: Reuters) Aaron Mooy scored for Huddersfield in the 50th minute. (Source: Reuters)

Promoted Huddersfield Town made it two wins out of two in the Premier League as a superb Aaron Mooy strike gave them a 1-0 home win over Newcastle United on Sunday.

The hosts built on last week‚Äôs 3-0 win over Crystal Palace, which marked their return to the top flight after a 45-year absence, when Australian Mooy grabbed the winner in the 50th minute.

Newcastle, who also won promotion from the Championship last season, should have equalised in the 68th minute but Ayoze Perez wasted a chance from close range.

Rafa Benitez‚Äôs Newcastle remain without a point following their home loss to Tottenham Hotspur last week.

There was a buzz of anticipation around the John Smith‚Äôs Stadium as Huddersfield, three times champions in the 1920‚Äôs, prepared to welcome England‚Äôs elite once more.

German manager David Wagner, whose team won promotion through the playoffs, has energised the Yorkshire town, injecting optimism and excitement into a club that had been struggling in the second tier Championship when he took over in November, 2015.

Signs of ‚ÄòWe are Premier League‚Äô were proudly displayed outside the ground and former players, such as ex-England international Frank Worthington, savoured the occasion in the stands.

A series of new signings, mainly from Europe, during the off-season has given Huddersfield a fighting chance of survival and their opening-day win at Palace only added to the optimism of the Terriers faithful.

Not surprisingly in such an atmosphere, Huddersfield attacked from the outset but there were few clear chances and a Tom Ince snap-shot in the 13th minute was their first real effort on goal.

A minute later, Newcastle threatened with their Scottish international winger Matt Ritchie forcing a fine diving save out of home keeper Jonas Lossl.

Huddersfield took the lead in outstanding fashion five minutes after the break with Australian midfielder Mooy playing a neat one-two with Elias Kachunga and then curling a fine shot past the helpless Rob Elliot.

Benitez took off the ineffective Dwight Gayle, replacing him with Spanish forward Joselu, and that, combined with greater urgency, saw Newcastle apply some pressure.

Perez should have brought Newcastle level in the 68th minute when he fired over the bar from five metres out and although Newcastle battled hard at the end, they lacked craft and ingenuity.

A massive roar greeted the final whistle from the home fans who know that every point is likely to matter if they are to remain in the Premier League at the end of the season.

"At BMC meeting, BJP, Sena spar over dustbins","BJP councillors attacked Shiv Sena corporators over the issue in the general body meeting of BMC. BJP councillors attacked Shiv Sena corporators over the issue in the general body meeting of BMC.

At a time when the city is preparing for waste segregation amid shortage of dustbins, a few Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) councillors have allegedly stocked up unused dustbins that they were supposed to distribute to citizens in their respective wards. BJP councillors attacked Shiv Sena corporators over the issue in the general body meeting of BMC.

The matter came to light on Friday after BJP councillor from ward 16 (Gorai) Anjali Khedekar reported that the previous corporator of the ward, Shiv Sena‚Äôs Sandhya Doshi, had stocked up dustbins at Kranti Maidan since last year. The matter reached police station with both Doshi, sitting corporator of ward 17 and Khedekar registering cross complaints against each other at Borivali police station.

The reason for not distributing the dustbins is ‚Äúsilly‚Äù according to BMC officials. A senior BMC official said, ‚ÄúFollowing delimitation, many candidates contested from other wards, while many lost the elections. The new corporators do not wish to distribute dustbins carrying stickers of pictures of previous corporators. Hence the dustbins are lying unused. They do not want to hand it over to BMC ward offices as they can use it for their own publicity.‚Äù

Doshi said there was a delay in supply of dustbins by the civic body, hence some dustbins could not be distributed. ‚ÄúBy the time dustbins reached us the model code of conduct was in place, hence a few dustbins were left and we kept them to be distributed later. What can we do with those dustbins? Those are meant for the citizens and will be given to them,‚Äù added Doshi.

Another Shiv Sena corporator Kishori Pednekar allegedly hoarded dustbins that she had purchased during her previous term. Pednekar was then the corporator of ward 191 which is mentioned on all the dustbins along with her name, while currently Pednekar is corporator of ward 199. Pednekar could not be contacted. In 2015, under Swacch Bharat Abhiyan, the civic body purchased nearly three lakh dustbins in December 2015. In November last year BMC allowed corporators to purchase dustbins from their funds.

Kumkum Bhagya full episode written update 22nd August 2017 full episode written update: Aaliya says even she can do anything for Purab, then why can‚Äôt he marry her.

Mitali tells Tanu and Aaliya that Abhi is the one who convinced both of them and asks them to follow the plan while Aaliya pushes the chair and it falls on Mitali‚Äôs foot. There Munni is going to get ready when Abhi stops her midway and puts his arms around her neck and says he has a surprise for her. Munni says it‚Äôs a thing of sanity to help two lovers to unite. She feels a bit awkward.

Next we see Abhi helping Purab to get ready while Munni is helping Disha. She says she can see the glow on her face that reflects Purab‚Äôs love. Disha says the same to Munni and she feels shy. Meanwhile Aaliya comes there and asks Munni what she was doing. Munni says she is helping Disha and when Aaliya stares at her, she says Dadi had asked her to do so. Aaliya asks her to go downstairs as Abhi needs her help with the caterers but Munni says she has seen it all. Aaliya signals her to go and she says she‚Äôll just come. Aaliya sits on the chair near the dressing while Disha is sitting by the bed. Aaliya introduces herself as Abhi‚Äôs sister and Disha says she didn‚Äôt recognise as they haven‚Äôt met before.

Aaliya reminisces when she told Mitali that she‚Äôll do the same with Disha as she did to Bulbul. She‚Äôll make it look like a suicide. Aaliya puts chlorophyll on a handkerchief and goes behind Disha while Disha is checking her phone. Dadi peeks in the room and is shocked to see Aaliya there, she goes in and holds her hand while Disha turns back and Dadi says she had some work with Aaliya so she came to call her. Dadi takes her out of the room and warns her to stay away from Disha or else she‚Äôll tell Abhi and then instead of going to Purab‚Äôs home she‚Äôll rather not get to stay in this house. Aaliya says her dream of marrying Purab will be fulfilled and no one can stop that. She warns Dadi to stop the wedding or else she‚Äôll do something she can‚Äôt even imagine.

Sangram Singh is in Mumbai and his goons ask him to go to Abhi‚Äôs house directly instead of roaming around but he says this is Mumbai and not Haryana to break into anyone‚Äôs house. They see two college boys around and Sangram Singh asks the driver to reach out to them. The driver pulls the break at the guy‚Äôs foot and he gets furious at him and asks him to pay attention on the road. Sangram Singh shows him the gun and he apologises to him. Sangram Singh asks his friend if he knows where Abhi lives and he tells him the way.

The stage is set for a performance and everyone enjoys the performance, meanwhile Aaliya asks Purab how he agreed to marry Disha and how he changed his opinion of living with Bulbul‚Äôs memories. She asks if he or Disha did some mistake that made him marry her and then she says even she can do anything for him then why he can‚Äôt marry her. She asks him for an answer but Purab says she can answer her but to understand that she doesn‚Äôt have a heart. Purab goes from there and Aaliya says she has a heart that loves him and takes her drink bottoms up.

"Triple Talaq: RSS praises PM Modi, welcomes SC ruling","Addressing a press conference in Delhi, another national executive committee member Indresh Kumar said that today ‚Äúis the most significant day for women in Indian history‚Äù. Addressing a press conference in Delhi, another national executive committee member Indresh Kumar said that today ‚Äúis the most significant day for women in Indian history‚Äù.

Welcoming the SC judgment on Triple Talaq and giving credit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the development, the RSS has termed it the beginning of a new era and end of ‚Äúold secularism‚Äù. Praising Modi for the ruling, Veteran Pracharak and RSS national executive committee member J Nandakumar tweeted that ‚ÄúNaMo raised the 3ple Talaq issue not only during political campaigns even in Independence day Address‚Äù.

Addressing a press conference in Delhi, another national executive committee member Indresh Kumar said that today ‚Äúis the most significant day for women in Indian history‚Äù. ‚Äú8-9 crore Indian women, who followed Islamic religion, were facing a huge social problem of Triple Talaq. They were tortured in the name of religion. Even God disliked it. God himself termed it a crime‚Ä¶SC has freed these women from torture and injustice,‚Äù he said.

He added that the ‚Äúfundamentalists who wrongly interpreted Koran‚Äù, have now been ‚Äúsilenced‚Äù. ‚ÄúMuslims have now realized that for the sake of politics and religion some leaders took them even away from Koran,‚Äù said Kumar.

RSS ideologue Rakesh Sinha termed it the end of ‚Äúold secularism‚Äù. ‚ÄúOld secularism meant connecting Hindus with terrorism, protecting Muslim obscurantism,abusing @RSSorg .The end of era now,‚Äù he tweeted.

He said that ‚ÄúIndian Muslim women realise the worth of secularism as a higher value than uncodified & medieval personal laws‚Äù. Several RSS leaders and RSS-affiliated journals like Panchjanya and Organiser have repeatedly taken the issue of Triple Talaq in the last few years.

Kumar said that ‚Äúthis is the day of women‚Äôs freedom from torture, of women‚Äôs respect and empowerment‚Äù.

About what kind of law he now wants, he said: ‚ÄúSC has delivered a judgment. The government will study it. There should not be any compromise with women‚Äôs respect.‚Äù

‚ÄúLakhs of Muslim women have already submitted their appeals to the government in this regard. The government should make the appropriate laws to ensure that women‚Äôs respect and participation is ensured,‚Äù he said.

Kumar termed that ‚Äúthose who oppose this judgment are anti-India and against fraternity‚Äù. ‚ÄúThey are evil forces. Therefore, I appeal 126 crore people to not to listen those who provoke,‚Äù he said.

Advocating for the Uniform Civil Code, he said that the Indian constitution ‚Äúrecognizes rules and customs‚Äù of several communities and religions, but India also ‚Äúhas a national law‚Äù. ‚ÄúThose who confront this national law on the ground of religion, they need to be changed and reformed,‚Äù he said.

Downbeat Rafa Benitez in the dark about Newcastle United signings,"Rafa Benitez rued Newcastle United‚Äôs lack of activity in the transfer market. (Source: Reuters) Rafa Benitez rued Newcastle United‚Äôs lack of activity in the transfer market. (Source: Reuters)

Newcastle United manager Rafael Benitez offered little hope to the club‚Äôs fans after a second straight loss in the Premier League, having made no secret of his disappointment at the club‚Äôs failure to make significant moves in the transfer market.

Newcastle fell to a 1-0 defeat at Huddersfield Town on Sunday in a meeting of two promoted clubs, having also lost at home to Tottenham Hotspur last week.

While Huddersfield are clearly riding the wave of their promotion through the playoffs, Newcastle who won the second tier Championship last season, finishing 13 points ahead of the Yorkshire club, appear to have none of that buzz.

‚ÄúIt was a long time ago,‚Äù was all Spaniard Benitez would say when asked if the momentum of promotion had been lost.

In the build up to the game he had talked, yet again, about his unhappiness with the club‚Äôs lack of activity in the transfer market.

It has been the issue that has surrounded United‚Äôs return to the top flight and their lack of invention and craft against David Wagner‚Äôs side served only to emphasise even further their need for some new additions.

Asked directly if that game had highlighted that requirement, Benitez replied: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù and he offered little extra when pushed.

‚ÄúNo news. I haven‚Äôt read the newspapers, we will have to wait. Obviously we are working behind the scenes trying to do things but I don‚Äôt know what our position is at the moment,‚Äù he said.

The club‚Äôs former striker Alan Shearer had tweeted after the match that on the evidence of the first two games it was going to be a long, hard season for Newcastle.

Benitez did not disagree but said he felt there would be an improvement as his team got used to playing in the top flight again and that they would be good enough to survive.

‚ÄúHopefully yes because I think we will improve‚Ä¶ we will need time but we will improve,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe have to keep working as hard as we did today and to play better if we can. It is something we have to learn every week,‚Äù he added.

The former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager spoke with little enthusiasm and asked about his mood had another short response: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not happy because we have lost two games.‚Äù

"I don‚Äôt want others to learn patience the way I have, says Sanjay Dutt","Sanjay Dutt opens up about his life, his movies and his relationship with directors before the release of his comeback film Bhoomi. Sanjay Dutt opens up about his life, his movies and his relationship with directors before the release of his comeback film Bhoomi.

The vastness of a star-lit sky finally reassured Sanjay Dutt that he was ‚Äúfree‚Äù. On the night of February 25, 2016, having been released from Pune‚Äôs Yerwada Central Jail after serving a six-year sentence, the actor went up to the terrace of Imperial Heights, his 14-storied family home in Mumbai‚Äôs Pali Hill. ‚ÄúI lay down on the terrace and looked at the sky above. That made me realise that there were no bars around me anymore,‚Äù says the actor. Dutt was embroiled in a long legal battle since his arrest on April 19, 1993 under TADA and the Arms Act for his alleged role in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts. He was convicted in 2013 for illegal possession of weapons.

With the 23-year tryst with law behind him, Dutt is making a ‚Äúcomeback‚Äù with Bhoomi, a film directed by Omung Kumar, which releases on September 22. The years spent in dealing with his drug habit, courtrooms, and prison life, he says, has brought about a big change. ‚ÄúI am a much more patient man. It takes a long time for me to lose my temper. I tell myself, jaane do (let it go). I was very short-tempered. Very rash. But I don‚Äôt want others to learn patience the way I have,‚Äù he says, when we meet in a glass-enclosed room in Imperial Heights.

The 58-year-old actor is wearing a pair of jeans, a black T-shirt and printed leather shoes. His well-toned body sports multiple tattoos, while his hair and beard are carefully clipped and dyed. Dutt chose Bhoomi, a film about a father‚Äôs search for justice for his raped daughter, because of its ‚Äústrong message‚Äù. ‚ÄúBhoomi is a story of a father and daughter from a lower middle-class background living in a small town. When the daughter is raped, it shows how the family deals with it,‚Äù says the actor, who is also father to six-year-old twins Iqra and Shahraan, and Trishala, from an earlier marriage. He claims to be ‚Äúas protective as any father‚Äù can get. ‚ÄúAccording to me, a girl is a blessing not a burden. I‚Äôm all for beti bachao and women‚Äôs empowerment,‚Äù he says.

As an interviewee, Dutt is known to give short answers. He lives up to that reputation, even though he does not dodge any question or shy away from talking about his past. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anyone to go through the same ordeal. One has to be balanced and focussed to be able to do that. However, the best part is to learn from it and forget about it.‚Äù Has forgetting been easy? ‚ÄúNo. But you have to move on in life. I want to work. I want to spend time with my kids and family,‚Äù he says.

Actor Ranbir Kapoor, who is playing the character of Dutt in a biopic directed by Rajkumar Hirani, had called his story ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù. ‚ÄúSanjay Dutt is so controversial and yet loved. The biopic is an honest take on an ordinary man, his mistakes as well as his relationship with his father and friends,‚Äù he had said in an earlier interview. Dutt has gone through the script of the film and visited its sets a couple of times. ‚ÄúThe film does not glorify me. It depicts the truth,‚Äù he says.

Dutt has an impressive line-up of releases in the next two years ‚Äî Sanjay Leela Bhansali-directed Padmavati, Abhishek Varman‚Äôs Shiddat with Alia Bhatt and Sridevi as co-actors; and Hasmukh Pighal Gaya, directed by Sejal Shah. He is also supposed to feature in Malang, produced by his old associate Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Dutt is also likely to feature in the future projects of Tigmanshu Dhulia, Mahesh Manjrekar and Anubhav Sinha. ‚ÄúI believe in commercial cinema. I am here to entertain people,‚Äù says the actor. While choosing a film, he goes by the character, screenplay and script. ‚ÄúMy choice also depends on who is directing the film,‚Äù he adds.

One of the key factors that has sustained Dutt in the industry for 36 years is the affection and goodwill he enjoys, and the strong bonds he has with directors. Hirani and Chopra swear by him while Kumar wants to do another film with him. ‚ÄúI enjoy working with them and they enjoy working with me. Till the time I have a good bonding with the directors, I can‚Äôt work. That is very important. My relationship with them goes beyond the sets,‚Äù he says. Kumar vouches for his affability. ‚ÄúBefore the making of Bhoomi, I did not know him well. Today, I feel I have known him for years,‚Äù he says.

Both Kumar and Karan Malhotra, who directed Agneepath (2012), are impressed by Dutt‚Äôs trust in his directors; he never checks the rushes after giving a shot. According to Malhotra, he is like a ‚Äúlamb‚Äù on the sets and does what the director wants. While shooting for Agneepath in the 40-degree summer temperatures of Diu, Malhotra was struggling to maintain Dutt‚Äôs bald look, created through prosthetics. Dutt solved the problem by shaving off his hair. ‚ÄúIt is this accommodating nature that has sustained his popularity,‚Äù says Malhotra.

It has also helped that Dutt is his father‚Äôs son. Sunil Dutt was an immensely loved and respected actor and Congress politician, with friends across the political spectrum. ‚ÄúMy father used to tell me, ‚ÄòUltimately, you have to be a nice human being, whether you are up or down in life‚Äô,‚Äù he says. Dutt was 22 when his mother, the actor Nargis, died of cancer. His father became his biggest source of strength. Sunil stood by his side all through, whether it was when he had to check into rehab for his addiction or during the TADA trials.

Despite a rough ride, Dutt considers himself ‚Äúlucky‚Äù. ‚ÄúPeople believed in my work and the directors believed that the role in Khal Nayak (1993) or Vaastav (1996) was perfect for me,‚Äù he says. The actor, who made his debut in Rocky (1981), directed by his father, also counts Naam (1986), Sadak (1991), Munnabhai MBBS (2003), Shabd (2005) and Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006) as some of his best films.

There is another side of Dutt, which is rarely spoken about. He grew up in a multi-faith household; Nargis was a Muslim and his father Hindu. In jail, he says, he read texts of many religions. ‚ÄúI respect all religions. My parents never told me to choose any particular religion. However, I believe in Hinduism and my god is Lord Shiva. I love him. I follow Bholenath‚Äôs path,‚Äù says Dutt. His reading, he says, has led him to conclude that ‚Äúall religions talk of peace‚Äù.

After being an actor and producer for over three decades, Dutt eventually wants to direct movies. ‚ÄúBut not now. My dad directed some fantastic movies like Yaadein and Reshma Aur Shera.

But I would like to make commercial movies. I wish to entertain the audience,‚Äù he says.

"No exemption from NEET for Tamil Nadu, Supreme Court directs government to start counselling process","Supreme Court (Files) Supreme Court (Files)

In a major blow to the Tamil Nadu government, the Supreme Court today asked the state to follow National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) after the Centre said the state cannot be exempted. The apex court also directed the Tamil Nadu government to start counselling process immediately and finish it by September 4.

As The Indian Express reported yesterday, the attorney general has said that the ordinance, sent by the Tamil Nadu government on the exemption of NEET, is not good in law.

Tamil Nadu has been against the implementation of NEET ‚Äì common medical exam as it argued that the test favours CBSE students over other state boards. Also, students from rural parts and belonging to weaker sections would lose seats in the medical colleges. You can read here what the AG said about NEET ordinance

The health ministry‚Äôs contended that if Tamil Nadu‚Äôs demand for exemption would be accepted then other states will have similar demands too.

The Tamil Nadu government has twice sent the ordinance to get an exemption. The ordinance was cleared by both the law and the Human Resource Development ministries. However, when it came to the health ministry, it was referred back to the attorney general KK Venugopal with some additional facts and past judgements of the apex court on the issue. It was in response to these additional facts that the A-G has revised his opinion, say top government sources.

NEET was made mandatory last year for admission in medical and dental colleges across India.

Tough for plus-size people to find work in the glamour industry: Anjali Anand,"It is tough for people to accept a big girl on the poster,‚Äù says Anjali Anand, who is known for her TV show ‚ÄúDhhai Kilo Prem‚Äù. It is tough for people to accept a big girl on the poster,‚Äù says Anjali Anand, who is known for her TV show ‚ÄúDhhai Kilo Prem‚Äù.

Actor-model Anjali Anand said plus-size people are still not accepted by the entertainment and glamour industry. Anjali, who walked the ramp for the all Primero collection by Wendell Rodricks at the Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017, said initially in her career, she faced a lot of difficulty to find work. ‚ÄúIt is a sad thing that we don‚Äôt have plus size models in India. Plus size people don‚Äôt get work in modelling or acting as much as normal people do. Finding work in glamour industry is tough.

‚ÄúWhen I started modelling as a plus size, I always thought I will not get the job in this country. People saw me on the posters and were shocked. It is tough for people to accept a big girl on the poster. I feel we should be happy about what we are. We have to be comfortable in whatever we are wearing,‚Äù she said. The actor, however, is happy that the mindset is slowly changing and things have become better for her post her TV show ‚ÄúDhhai Kilo Prem.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs view is changing. I did modelling and then did a show and now people have started looking at me differently. It motivates me.‚Äù

Rodricks‚Äô collection was a rule breaker starting with the colours ‚Äì white, which has been taboo for too long where plus sizes are concerned. Then it was neutrals, grey and clothes with great volume. The designer said he has always designed for voluptuous women as he believes it is unfair to ignore a major section of the society just because they don‚Äôt fit in the ‚Äúperfect body‚Äù bracket.

‚ÄúWe have plus size concept all over the world but nothing was there for Indian women. We wanted to create something for Indian women. Plus size women feel they are completely out of the purview of the fashion. 60 per cent of the population falls in this category, so we tried to break the myth. ‚ÄúFor me that was a personal accomplishment of sorts. This was the real show for me, this was the best show for me.‚Äù

Varonica Campabell, India‚Äôs first transgender plus size model walked for the show along with 20 other plus size models, who were selected through an audition held in June. While the women‚Äôs wear was a kaleidoscope of colours and included layered tunics, asymmetric gowns, winging dresses, capes and kaftans, the menswear featured deconstructed plackets, mull bundies, tunics, and twill cotton.

The lycra shirts with contrast stitch details, poly knits, silver speck foil prints, crush pleated poly georgette and pewter shine stripes completed the extensive fabrics and detailing choices.

Petitioner against Art. 35A says she has ‚Äòanecdotal‚Äô proof that she is from Kashmir,"Representational Image/ PTI Representational Image/ PTI

THE petitioner behind the second challenge to Article 35A of the Constitution, which accords special rights and privileges to residents of Jammu and Kashmir, says she has ‚Äúanecdotal evidence‚Äù to suggest her family is originally from Kashmir, and that they had left it 200 years ago. Charu Wali Khanna, a lawyer and former member of the National Commission for Women, filed the petition against Article 35A in the Supreme Court after the J&K government refused to identify her as a permanent resident because she didn‚Äôt have any documentary evidence to prove her claim. The apex court has clubbed her plea with a petition challenging the constitutional validity of the provision.

Admitting she doesn‚Äôt have any documentary proof to suggest her family is from Kashmir, only ‚Äúanecdotal‚Äù, Khanna says, ‚ÄúBut I am telling them (the J&K government) why are you questioning me, questioning my identity. It is impossible for me to trace what happened 200 years ago. My father is 98‚Ä¶ Madan Mohan Kishan Wali. He has anecdotal evidence.‚Äù The petition that Khanna has filed at the Supreme Court says, ‚ÄúBeing a Kashmiri Pandit woman by ancestry (Khanna) desires to build a home in J&K, in order to re-discover her roots, but due to the peculiar discriminatory laws, is unable to purchase property in J&K being a Non Permanent Resident.‚Äù

Khanna has filed the petition along with a Kashmiri Pandit doctor, Seema Razdan Bhargav. The two have also challenged Article 35A on grounds of ‚Äúblatant gender discrimination‚Äù. In her representation to Governor N N Vohra on permanent resident status, Khanna said, ‚ÄúThe history and genealogy of my ancestors is a mix of myths and oral tradition which is more than 11,000 years old.

I have been told that the Aryan Saraswat Brahmans, who used to live on the banks of the Saraswati river, migrated to the Kashmir Valley‚Ä¶ came to be known as ‚ÄòBhattas‚Äô‚Ä¶ Kashmiri Pandits or the Aryan Saraswat Brahmans of Kashmir, who believe in the mystic combination of Shaivism, Kali Bhakti, Shakti worship and Tantra.‚Äù

Of her own family, she said, ‚ÄúI have been told that my ancestors were part of the 6th exodus (during Afghan rule 1753-1819) who migrated from Kashmir to escape the reign of brutal tyranny‚Ä¶ According to anecdotal evidence, they went down the west coast of Maharashtra and Goa (possibly by the river route) and some went to Uttar Pradesh where the Nawabs of Oudh of Shia Persian dynasty provided them a congenial environment‚Ä¶ My maternal title ‚ÄòWali (meaning a Muslim saint)‚Äô was given to an ancestor by the Pushtun Durrani Empire Sultan, whom he cured of disease by perambulating his bed.‚Äù The state of Jammu and Kashmir was only formed in 1846.

Questioning the J&K government‚Äôs right to ask for proof for her family‚Äôs antecedents and for documents to prove her ancestors lived in the state, she says, ‚ÄúMy whole existence is at stake. If you are going to ask me to prove my identity, how will I do that? I am not interested in history, I am interested in today. I have a Kashmiri ethnic identity. ‚ÄúI am questioning how can they create a separate citizen category for J&K. I was born in Madhya Pradesh. So tomorrow, if someone questions me that because I am not born in Delhi I can‚Äôt work here, I cannot live here‚Ä¶ If the same logic is going to apply, what then?‚Ä¶ We need to do away with these laws.‚Äù

Khanna argues that since ‚ÄúArticle 35A was introduced through a presidential order in 1954, it is unconstitutional‚Äù. When it is pointed out that striking down the 1954 order would mean the subsequent orders that extend to a majority of the constitutional provisions in J&K will also go, she says, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong in that?‚Äù

Article 35A empowers the J&K Constitution to define ‚Äúpermanent residents‚Äù of the state, and was added through ‚ÄúConstitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954‚Äù, issued by the President under Article 370. It replicates a state subject law promulgated by Dogra king Maharaja Hari Singh in 1927, following a strong campaign by Kashmiri Pandits who were opposed to the hiring of civil servants from Punjab.

The BJP government has the numbers to act, Khanna adds. ‚ÄúThey have their own President, they can do anything. If something wrong has been happening, that must go.‚Äù Khanna dismisses talk of ‚ÄúKashmiriyat and syncretism‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere have been atrocities, genocide, that is why there has been migration‚Ä¶ A whole generation has grown up with the concept of azadi. It isn‚Äôt their fault. It is because of lack of governance that they took the wrong path‚Ä¶ The radicalisation has also been created.‚Äù

"IARI soil-testing technology tweaked, private firm has monopoly","Since December, Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Agro Chemicals Private Limited has sold over 5,000 kits and refills worth Rs 83 crore through NAFED alone, without any tender. (Representational Image) Since December, Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Agro Chemicals Private Limited has sold over 5,000 kits and refills worth Rs 83 crore through NAFED alone, without any tender. (Representational Image)

Despite objections raised by senior officers, a low-cost digital soil-testing technology developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), has been tweaked by a sister ICAR institute and the licence for its manufacture and sale given to a sole private company.

Since December last year, the private company, Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Agro Chemicals Private Limited (NACPL), has sold over 5,000 kits and refills worth Rs 83 crore through NAFED alone, without any tender.

Records accessed by The Indian Express show that in 2009, Delhi-based IARI invented the ‚ÄúDigital Soil Test Fertiliser Recommendation (STFR)‚Äù technology ‚Äî under which a farmer could, using an electronic device, test seven soil parameters and obtain specific fertiliser recommendations. This opened up the possibilities of taking soil-testing facilities, traditionally limited to a handful of institutional laboratories, to the grassroots.

The IARI filed a patent application for STFR in 2011 and started issuing licences for its commercialisation in 2012. In July 2014, NACPL was among several companies that obtained a licence from IARI for commercialising this STFR technology. The next month, the company tied up with another ICAR lab, the Indian Institute of Soil Science (IISS) in Bhopal, to ostensibly improve on the STFR technology.

A day before the Prime Minister launched the nationwide Soil Health Card scheme on February 19, 2015, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh unveiled Mridaparikshak/mini lab developed by IISS in collaboration with NACPL. Despite IARI‚Äôs protestations ‚Äî ‚Äúa case of copying of Pusa STFR patented technology with a few more elements and parameters added‚Äù ‚Äî the company secured exclusive rights for commercialising the ‚Äúproprietary item‚Äù.

The IISS formally launched Mridaparikshak/mini lab, which could test 10 soil parameters, on April 7, 2015. The same day, K V Prabhu, Joint Director (Research), IARI, wrote to the ICAR Director General, claiming that NACPL violated intellectual property rights by ‚Äúunauthorised modification and disclosure‚Äù of technology to IISS.

In his letter, Prabhu stated that the IARI would have taken action had a sister ICAR institute (IISS) not been involved. ‚ÄúAn urgent action is solicited before the same situation extends to independent private-public collaboration based on ICAR technology,‚Äù he wrote.

Yet in May 2015, ICAR allowed IISS to apply for a patent for its Mridaparikshak/mini lab and its commercialisation by NACPL alone.

As both IARI and IISS continued refining their respective products, procurement under the soil health card scheme gathered steam when the government sanctioned setting up over 6,000 mini labs in 2016-2017.

In March 2016, the IARI offered an improved STFR technology to its licencees which could analyse 10 of 12 parameters required for the government‚Äôs soil health card, and set a December 2016 deadline for adding the two missing parameters which were already available in Mridaparikshak/mini lab of IISS.

As IARI offered those two parameters, NACPL in November lodged a series of complaints with ICAR against other STFR licencees, accusing them of copying the features from IISS Mridaparikshak. Acting on these complaints, the ICAR on February 7 this year handed over the allegations made by NACPL against the licensees to the vigilance section for ‚Äúnecessary action‚Äù and stopped further licensing of STFR pending the inquiry.

On February 1, 2017, ICAR director Trilochan Mohapatra wrote to all ICAR institutes to ‚Äúmake use‚Äù of Mridaparikshak/mini lab developed by IISS, describing the product as ‚Äúa proprietary item with exclusive rights of manufacturing and distribution presents with NACPL Agro Chemicals Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad‚Äù.

Result: Mini lab remains the only digital soil-tester with 12 mandatory parameters in the market and NACPL continues to enjoy a virtual market monopoly selling the device at a price ‚Äî Rs 86,000 (plus Rs 17,000 for each refill of chemicals) without tax ‚Äî fixed by IISS.

IARI scientist emeritus S C Datta, who conceived the STFR idea in 2005, said he was not authorised to comment on administrative issues. ‚ÄúAll I can say is that the STFR technology is unique in its electronic aspects which make it a programmable digital colorimeter. Adding as many parameters as required is only a matter of details and such tweaking cannot hijack a patent-applied-for technology,‚Äù he said.

For over a week until his retirement on July 31, J S Sandhu, Deputy Director General, ICAR and Acting Director, IARI, did not respond to phone calls and emails for comment.

IARI Joint Director (Research) K V Prabhu said he was hopeful that the ‚Äúvalidation process will be completed soon and commercialisation of all parameters of STFR will be made possible‚Äù.

IISS director A K Patra declined comment on the charge of modifying the STFR technology into a proprietary item. ‚ÄúMridaparikshak technology has been applied for IP protection. mini lab has been commercialised as per ICAR guidelines,‚Äù he said in an email.

Mukund Maheshwari, Managing Director, NACPL, rejected the allegations: ‚ÄúNACPL is the market leader because we are in this business since 2003 when we started using the technology obtained from A P Agricultural University. I went to IISS with the STFR technology only when IARI refused, verbally, to improve it.‚Äù

ICAR Director General Trilochan Mohapatra did not respond to emails and phone calls.

Iraqi security forces launched on Sunday an offensive to take back the city of Tal Afar, their next objective in the US-backed campaign to defeat Islamic State (IS) militants, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said. ‚ÄúYou either surrender, or die,‚Äù Abadi said in a televised speech announcing the offensive, addressing the militants.

A longtime stronghold of hardline Sunni insurgents, Tal Afar, 50 miles (80 km) west of Mosul, was cut off from the rest of the Islamic State-held territory in June.

The city is surrounded by Iraqi government troops and Shi‚Äôite volunteers in the south, and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in the north. About 2,000 battle-hardened militants remain in the city, according to US and Iraqi military commanders. Islamic State‚Äôs self-proclaimed ‚Äúcaliphate‚Äù effectively collapsed last month, when US-backed Iraqi forces completed the takeover of the militants‚Äô capital in Iraq, Mosul, after a nine-month campaign.

Annabelle Creation movie review: This Conjuring spin-off disappoints,"Annabelle Creation movie review: The questions we want answered are never asked in the movie. Annabelle Creation movie review: The questions we want answered are never asked in the movie.

Annabelle Creation movie cast: Miranda Otto, Stephanie Sigman, Anthony LaPaglia, Lulu Wilson

Annabelle Creation movie director: David Sandberg

Annabelle Creation movie rating: 2 stars

PARENTS frightened of their own child have sustained many a horror film. A malevolent spirit in a child‚Äôs doll many others. We needn‚Äôt look further than even The Conjuring, of which Annabelle: Creation is the fourth spin-off, and the prequel to a prequel. Yeah, by now, they should have this pat down. Annabelle: Creation has all that, plus a desolate house, orphans, nun, a mysterious woman behind a curtain, a forbidden door, a scarecrow, a barn, a basement, a chair lift, a lift hidden behind a wall, a well, and lots and lots of dolls. Who needs a story, or even one character that does things besides opening strange doors?

Sometime in the early 1940s, a doll-maker and his wife, Samuel (LaPaglia) and Esther (Otto) Mullins, lose their young daughter to an accident. They sequester themselves in their old, rickety farmhouse, away from all civilization, along with their grief, the doll Annabelle (named after their daughter) and ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù. Twelve years later, to this house arrives a nun (Sigman) with six girls, her wards at an orphanage that has shut down. One of the girls, Janice (Bateman), is polio-afflicted, and left on her own by the other girls, starts exploring the house with its many secrets and strange happenings.

Then the happenings never cease, with director Sandberg (Lights Out) deploying largely the same tricks. The questions we want answered are never asked. So, we know nothing of the nun, but for the titillating detail that she was once at a ‚ÄúRomania convent where the other sisters have no contact with the outside world‚Äù; nothing about the girls, of varying ages and desires, and some more interesting than the others, stuck together; and almost zero about the couple who have put them in harm‚Äôs way. The actors, with the exception of Bateman, and that largely because she is the star victim this time, are largely impassive.

One thing is clear though, we are not done with Annabelle yet. The photo the nun shows of her Romania convent has a mysterious figure lurking in the shadows. Up next in The Conjuring series is Nun.

"Total solar eclipse to occur today: How, when, where to watch it; all you need to know","The photo shows a total solar eclipse in Belitung, Indonesia in 2016. (Source: AP) The photo shows a total solar eclipse in Belitung, Indonesia in 2016. (Source: AP)

On Monday, the United States of America will witness a rare phenomenon in its skies, a total solar eclipse which will cast a shadow cutting diagonally through the American mainland. The eclipse will pass through Oregon to Charleston, South Carolina. Meanwhile, many areas of Canada, Central America and the northern part of south America will experience a partial eclipse. The August 21 eclipse is occurring after a gap of 99 years, the previous astronomical phenomenon was recorded way back in the US in 1918.

While Americans have begun gathering in large numbers at campsites around the city of Oregon to witness the once in a lifetime natural occurrence, India will not be able to get a first-hand experience of the total eclipse on Monday and will have to wait till 2034.

Not in the US? Here is how to watch it

NASA has, however, planned to live stream the eclipse to the rest of the world. According to the NASA website, ‚ÄúViewers will be provided with a wealth of images captured before, during, and after the eclipse by 11 spacecrafts, at least three NASA aircraft, more than 50 high-altitude balloons, and the astronauts aboard the International Space Station.‚Äù Many news channels will also broadcast the eclipse live.

Termed as ‚ÄòThe Great American Eclipse‚Äô, the partial phase of the eclipse will begin over the Pacific Ocean at 1546 GMT (9.16 PM IST) and will end at 18.48 GMT (12.52 AM IST). In totality it will cross from Oregon into Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and, finally, South Carolina, also passing over tiny slivers of Montana and Iowa. The eclipse will last longest near Carbondale, Illinois for 2.44 minutes.

(Source: Reuters)

The different phases of the total solar eclipse

According to NASA, in the initial phase of the total eclipse, the Sun‚Äôs disk will be partially blocked by the moon which can last for over an hour and can be viewed by a pair of specially designed glasses. In phase two of the rare eclipse, sunlight streaming through the Moon‚Äôs valleys will create a bright flash of light, giving the appearance of a diamond ring. This marks the final moments before totality takes over. Phase three is refereed as the Baily‚Äôs Beads where only low lying valleys on the moon‚Äôs edge will allow shimmering light to pass through, leading to the complete solar eclipse in phase four, which lasts for under a minute in some of the locations. In the final stages, crescent will begin to peek from behind the moon. Experts have advised people to not look directly at the Sun during the eclipse and especially in the final phase which may render severe damage to eyes.

Monday‚Äôs total solar eclipse comes after 1979 when the US mainland experienced the last eclipse across Oregon, Washington state, Idaho, Montana and North Dakota, entering into Canada. However, if you give it a miss on Monday, the next total solar eclipse will be in 2019 over Argentina, South Pacific and Chile. America will experience the next total solar eclipse passing through its mainland only in April 2024 when the totality will cross from Texas, through the Midwest, Indianapolis, Cleveland, New York, up over New England and out over Maine and New Brunswick, Canada.

Lack of generosity from spouse drives women to be unfaithful: Survey,"As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue (Source: ThinkStock Images) As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue (Source: ThinkStock Images)

Once the wooing stage is over and the couple has settled down, some men become far less generous and downright stingy. This leads to most women becoming unfaithful to their partners, according to a survey. Gleeden, a European dating site for married individuals, catering to people seeking affairs outside their relationships, conducted a research on 5,000 Indian women users of the dating site who belong to the age group of 23-35 years.

According to the study, married women do not ask to be showered with gifts, but they do appreciate being looked after and valued. As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue.

Most women link infidelity to the lack of generosity from their husbands. Around 69 per cent women think that the lack of sweet words, tenderness, small gestures and initiatives is because their spouse is cheating on them or is in the process.

To explain their own infidelity as a result of their spouse‚Äôs ignorant behaviour, 39 per cent of the women members stated that it was their need to feel valued.

Around 29 per cent women admitted their self-esteem is hurt when their spouse does not make sufficient effort. Over a quarter of them declared that stinginess has suppressed their desire for their spouse, and that they consider this defect to be a real romance killer.

‚ÄúWe are delighted to see the increasing number of Indian users in our site and how encounters outside marriage is no more a taboo or something to be shy about in India. In this survey, we have seen what could be the reason for the women to move out from their marital bond to find new encounters,‚Äù Sol√®ne Paillet, head of communications and a manager at Gleeden, said in a statement.

‚ÄúThe company‚Äôs aim is not only to bring members together but to anticipate their expectations and needs and providing them with reliable content, a high-quality interface and many innovative services and I believe, this survey gave us a ray of hope to provide more tempting services to our users,‚Äù Paillet added.

Qatar denies blocking Saudi Arabia‚Äôs hajj pilgrimage flights,"Qatar‚Äôs Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani (Photo: AP) Qatar‚Äôs Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani (Photo: AP)

Qatar today denied it had banned Saudi Arabian flights from landing in the emirate to transport Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, after an accusation by authorities in Riyadh. Saudi Arabian Airlines on Sunday said Qatari authorities had refused to grant a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight, scheduled to transport Qatari hajj pilgrims, permission to land at Hamad International Airport.

The flight is one of a select few that will allow Qataris to land in Saudi Arabia, which last week temporarily opened its borders to pilgrims to the Saudi city of Mecca, the most revered site in Islam, more than two months into a diplomatic crisis that has seen Riyadh cut all ties with Qatar and ban its citizens from entering. An official source in the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority on Monday ‚Äúdescribed as baseless the news‚Ä¶ that allegedly claimed that the state of Qatar refused to allow Saudi Airlines to transport the Qatari pilgrims,‚Äù according to a report carried on the state-run QNA news agency.

Qatar‚Äôs civil aviation authority confirmed that it had received a request from the Saudi carrier for permission to land and had referred the airline to the ministry of Islamic affairs ‚Äúin accordance with past practices‚Äù.

The hajj to Mecca, a pillar of Islam that capable Muslims must perform at least once, takes place at the start of September this year. It is expected to draw around two million Muslims from around the world.

The pilgrimage has turned into a point of contestation between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which are locked in a diplomatic crisis that has seen Saudi Arabia and its allies cut all ties with Doha over accusations of state support for Islamist extremist groups and ties to Shiite Iran. Qatar has denied the allegations.

Saudi Arabia last month said Qatari pilgrims would be allowed to enter the kingdom for this year‚Äôs hajj but imposed several travel restrictions, including flying in only on airlines approved by Riyadh. The move sparked a backlash in Doha, where authorities said the pilgrimage had been used as political ammunition.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar on June 5 in what has become the worst political crisis to grip the Gulf region in decades.

"Kashmir NCC woman cadet trolled on Facebook over azadi, stone pelting comments","The video of her sound bite, taken by a little known news portal News Review, went viral on Facebook and she was trolled for her comments on the social media site. The video of her sound bite, taken by a little known news portal News Review, went viral on Facebook and she was trolled for her comments on the social media site.

An NCC woman cadet from South Kashmir was trolled by Facebook users for her strong message to the youth of Jammu and Kashmir, urging them to shun stone pelting and azadi campaigns and to enjoy ‚Äúreal freedom‚Äù in India. The video of her sound bite, taken by a little known news portal News Review, went viral on Facebook and she was trolled for her comments on the social media site.

Later, News Review deleted the post but reproduced it without showing her face yesterday evening. Abuse flooded the comments section thereafter. Some of the other women cadets from Kashmir, who are undergoing training at the National Cadet Corps (NCC) camp at Sainik school at Nagrota on the outskirts of Jammu city, echoed her views.

‚ÄúStay away from stone pelting and azadi campaigns‚Ä¶,‚Äù one of them said. The soft-spoken woman, a student of the government women‚Äôs degree college in Anantnag, yesterday said she was the only woman representing her college at the camp even. Many others wanted to join the camp but were discouraged by their parents from doing so because of the troubled situation in south Kashmir.

‚ÄúI want to tell the youth that the real azadi (freedom) is here. If you want azadi, it is here,‚Äù she said in the post and asked young Kashmiris to stay away from stone pelting and raising pro azadi slogans. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt go towards bad things like protests, stone pelting or getting involved in sloganeering for azadi. Azadi is nothing. If you want azaadi, it is here,‚Äù she said.

Over 100 Kashmiri cadets including a good number of women are taking part in the NCC camp for selection to the Jammu and Kashmir Directorate Thal Sainik team which will take part in national level competitions in Delhi shortly. While hundreds of comments targeted her, a few defended her stance as well. One comment read, ‚ÄúGo join the Indian dogs,‚Äù to her post.

One Facebook user questioned those heaping abuse on her and asked them to be careful with their language. He too came under fire. In January this year, Kashmiri teenager Zaira Wasim, whose performance as the young Geeta Phogat in ‚ÄòDangal‚Äô earned her plaudits, was forced to apologise publicly after her pictures with CM Mehbooba Mufti went viral on social media, and the Jammu & Kashmir chief minister described her as a ‚ÄúKashmiri role model‚Äù.

Britain seeks smooth rules to resolve legal disputes post Brexit,"Britain says it will leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice once it quits the bloc in Mach 2019, meaning new structures will be needed for resolving international disputes.

Britain says rules governing judicial cooperation with the European Union should stay much as they are now after Brexit to prevent international business disputes and divorce battles from becoming longer and more complicated. Britain‚Äôs Department for Exiting the European Union says the country wants to ‚Äúmirror closely the current EU system‚Äù governing which country‚Äôs courts deal with civil disputes, which laws apply and how judgments are enforced.

In a paper Tuesday, the government did not say in detail how that could happen.

Britain says it will leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice once it quits the bloc in Mach 2019, meaning new structures will be needed for resolving international disputes. Negotiations between Britain and the bloc are to resume in Brussels at the end of August.

Manchester City‚Äôs Samir Nasri completes move to Antalyaspor,"Samir Nasri joined Antalyaspor from Manchester City. (Source: Reuters) Samir Nasri joined Antalyaspor from Manchester City. (Source: Reuters)

Samir Nasri has completed his move from Manchester City to Turkish side Antalyaspor, signing a two-year deal, the Premier League side said on Monday.

Nasri, who scored 27 goals in 176 appearances for City and won both the league title and the League Cup twice, ends a six-year spell at the club.

The 30-year-old was loaned out to La Liga side Sevilla by manager Pep Guardiola at the start of last season in a bid to reignite his career.

The French forward played 30 games for the Spanish team before returning to Manchester during pre-season training.

Nasri excelled in the 2013-14 season, scoring 11 times to help the side capture a second league title in three years.

Despite signing a five-year contract extension in 2014, the former Arsenal player was unable to replicate his high standards from the previous season, failing to secure a regular starting place in the team.

Nasri won 41 international caps for France, scoring five goals.

Mystery Qatari sheikh pushed into Gulf crisis spotlight; played crucial role in reopening border with Saudi Arabia,"It also prompted speculation that the sheikh, the brother of a former emir, was being used to undermine or even replace the current Qatari leadership. (Representative Image) It also prompted speculation that the sheikh, the brother of a former emir, was being used to undermine or even replace the current Qatari leadership. (Representative Image)

Two months into a bitter Gulf crisis, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs use of a previously unknown Qatari royal family member has opened a new ‚Äì and bizarre ‚Äì front in the conflict. On August 17, it was announced that Saudi‚Äôs King Salman had ordered the reopening of the Qatar border to allow pilgrims from the emirate to join the annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The decision, at first glance an apparent thawing in a crisis ongoing since June 5, was apparently taken after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met an obscure member of Qatar‚Äôs ruling dynasty, Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim al-Thani.

Notably, it was the first public high-level encounter between the nations since the crisis erupted. Saudi Arabian authorities highlighted the role of the mysterious Qatari in reopening the border.

Then it was reported that King Salman had received Sheikh Abdullah at his residence in Tangier, Morocco. And straight afterwards, a Twitter account was set-up in the sheikh‚Äôs name, gaining more than 250,000 followers in just two days and nine tweets.

‚ÄúWhat I did was only for the good of Qatar,‚Äù he wrote in one tweet. But far from playing a conciliatory role, the emergence of Sheikh Abdullah may have aggravated matters. Doha was quick to point out that he was in Saudi Arabia on a ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù mission, not for the government, and angry social media users in Qatar claimed the Twitter account was ‚Äúfake‚Äù.

It also prompted speculation that the sheikh, the brother of a former emir, was being used to undermine or even replace the current Qatari leadership. Unlikely, say analysts.

‚ÄúSheikh Abdullah‚Ä¶ is not part of the very inner circle of the ruling elite in Qatar today,‚Äù said Andreas Krieg, a strategic risk analyst and assistant professor at King‚Äôs College London university and who knows the workings of the state apparatus in Qatar. ‚ÄúHe lives abroad but is not exiled.‚Äù

The sheikh belongs to a branch of the Al-Thani royal family which may have seen its power eroded in recent years, but is still very well-connected. He is a cousin of the Father Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, who seized power in 1995, overseeing a transformation of his country into an economic powerhouse until stepping down in 2013 to give power to his son and current leader, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani. Sheikh Abdullah is also the son of a former emir deposed by the grandfather of Sheikh Tamim.

The meetings in Saudi Arabia and Morocco were meant to put pressure on Qatar‚Äôs so far unyielding leadership, since the crisis began on June 5, added Krieg. ‚ÄúIt is unusual that someone like him gets an official audience with the king and the crown prince,‚Äù said Krieg.

"Flooded Kaziranga counts its 369 dead: 1 tiger, 2 dozen rhinos, hundreds of deer","The tiger was found dead in Kaziranga on August 18; it is believed to have died on August 14. AP The tiger was found dead in Kaziranga on August 18; it is believed to have died on August 14. AP

Kaziranga National Park, home to the highest number of one-horned rhinos in the world, has lost 369 animals in two successive waves of floods, with the casualty list including nearly two dozen rhinos, one tiger, several elephants and buffaloes and over 250 deer of various species. ‚ÄúThe first wave of floods in July came in slowly; the second wave was very rapid, catching the animals almost totally unawares,‚Äù park director Satyendra Singh said. ‚ÄúOn August 12 for instance, the water level rose by more than 10 feet in just about 10 to 12 hours.‚Äù

Though the park remained under water for a longer period during the first wave, it lost fewer animals then ‚Äî 105. In comparison, it has lost 264 more until Monday, of which over 200 were various species of deer. The toll in the current wave includes 20 rhinos, apart from five elephant calves, four buffaloes and four wild boars, besides the tiger. Though the tiger carcass was found on Friday, park director Singh said it had died on August 14 itself. ‚ÄúOur guards on duty had reported hearing a loud unusual sound from elephants on that day. On Friday morning we found a tiger carcass in a small highland, with the carcass of an elephant calf nearby. The tiger, a four-year-old male, might have died after it was attacked by a herd of elephants while it had probably tried to attack the elephant calf. It is an assumption though,‚Äù Singh told The Indian Express over the telephone.

The other possibility, according to Singh, is that the tiger came under attack from the elephant herd following a space crunch on the small highland where all of them had taken shelter when the water-level suddenly rose. ‚ÄúThe second situation appears more likely, going by the fact that postmortem examined showed there was a lot of hog deer meat in the tiger‚Äôs intestines,‚Äù he said. Kaziranga has the highest density of Royal Bengal tigers in India, with the last count showing 104 tigers in the 430-sq-km park.

Among the over 200 deer that Kaziranga has lost in the second wave so far, most were hog deer, the remainder being swamp deer and sambar. ‚ÄúWhile bigger animals like elephants, tigers, rhinos and buffaloes generally move out faster to higher lands, especially across the national highway to Karbi Anglong, smaller animals run the risk of getting washed away by swirling flood-waters,‚Äù Singh said. Smaller animals like the hog deer also get knocked down while crossing the highway.

Kaziranga has also suffered serious damage to its infrastructure in the two successive waves of floods. With about 30 per cent of park still under water, Singh said a sizeable number of wooden bridges and anti-poaching camps have been damaged. ‚ÄúWe will be able to make a final assessment only when the entire flood-water flows out of the park. But several wooden bridges as well as pucca culverts have been visibly damaged, some of them also washed away,‚Äù he said.

Kaziranga will also require major repair of the roads inside, especially with the Brahmaputra leaving behind a lot of slush and sand after the water receded. ‚ÄúWe have about 500 km of roads and patrol tracks in the Park on the southern bank of the Brahmaputra, and these will have to be immediately repaired once the floods were completely out,‚Äù he said.

Lebanon monitored Australia bomb plot suspects: Lebanese Interior Minister,"Lebanese Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk told a news conference that one of the men‚Äôs brothers, Tareq Khayat, had moved to the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa in Syria and become a commander in the jihadist group more than a year ago.

(Representational Image)

Lebanon monitored the brothers accused of plotting to blow up a flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi for more than a year and coordinated with the Australian government on it for a long time, the Lebanese interior minister said on Monday. Australian police charged Khaled Khayat and Mahmoud Khayat this month with two counts of planning a terrorist attack after conducting raids to disrupt what authorities described as an Islamic State-inspired plot to bomb an Etihad Airways flight.

Lebanese Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk told a news conference that one of the men‚Äôs brothers, Tareq Khayat, had moved to the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa in Syria and become a commander in the jihadist group more than a year ago.

Lebanon‚Äôs Internal Security Force then placed Tareq, Khaled and Mahmoud Khayat, and a fourth brother, Amer Khayat, under surveillance. Khaled, Mahmoud and Amer were all living in Australia but occasionally visited Lebanon, he said in Beirut. Machnouk said the brothers were Lebanese.

He said Amer Khayat had arrived in Lebanon on July 15, the day Australian police have said the plotters tried to smuggle a bomb onto an Etihad flight from Sydney. Australian police also said a man had tried to check in luggage without knowing that it contained a bomb, which was hidden in a meat grinder, placed there by his brother. However, Machnouk said Amer Khayat was to have carried out the attack and that a Lebanese internal intelligence agency had found he was ‚Äúinvolved in the operation‚Äù. He said a bomb had also been hidden in a large child‚Äôs doll in the luggage.

He did not say what has happened to Amer Khayat since he landed in Lebanon. The plot was foiled because the luggage exceeded the airline‚Äôs weight limit, Machnouk said.

Australian police had previously said it appeared that one of the accused had left the airport, taking the luggage with him, while his brother boarded the plane and left Australia. On Tuesday, Australian police said it was not appropriate to comment further on the details of a current investigation that was also before Australian courts. ‚ÄúWe have a close and cooperative relationship with the Lebanese authorities and are working closely on this investigation,‚Äù an Australian Federal Police spokeswoman said in an email.

Asked whether the operation would have been successful if the luggage had not exceeded the weight limit, Machnouk said: ‚ÄúProbably, yes‚Äù. He said information from Lebanese intelligence had ‚Äúassisted in foiling a large operation aiming to blow up a plane‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe plane had 120 Lebanese on board in addition to other nationalities,‚Äù Machnouk said.

Virat Kohli and team India had a day off after beating Sri Lanka convincingly by nine wickets in the first of five ODIs and a solitary T20 on Sunday. The Indian skipper too played a key role in teams‚Äô comprehensive win in Dambulla by scoring 82 and remaining unbeaten. The win once again hurt Sri Lanka‚Äôs confidence level and put a dent on their chances of opening their account in the series. Additionally, Sri Lanka need two wins in the remaining four matches to automatically qualify for the 2019 World Cup. Should they fail, West Indies can take over their spot.

On Monday morning, Kohli chose to spend the day amid Sri Lankan nature with a backdrop of elephants taking a swim. Kohli tweeted, ‚ÄúRecent day out around these gentle giants! üòáüòá Such innocence and playfulness was blissful to see. üêòüêò‚Äù.

Interestingly, and hilariously, his girlfriend Anushka Sharma was not too far away. She too had a near similar picture ‚Äì elephants in the background and wearing the same kind of hat while in the same balcony. ‚ÄúA day spent with elephants ‚Ä¶ is a day spent well ! üêòüíú‚Äù is how Anushka captioned the photograph on Instagram.

The two have already been spotted previously in an eco-friendly date and planted a sapling. They were also together in New York with the Bollywood actress there for the IIFA Awards prior to the Sri Lankan tour.

In the first ODI, Kohli gave good support to opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan who scored 132* to keep his tremendous run in the island going. He was rewarded with the Man of the Match for his performance.

Kirori Mal gets rid of 6 student union posts,"The Kirori Mal College (KMC) administration has decided to do away with six posts in its students‚Äô union, including that of Sports Secretary and Cultural Secretary. The election to the union is scheduled to be held later this year. The college principal announced the decision through a notice on August 18.

‚ÄúThe Students‚Äô Union advisory committee recommended to abolish the following posts from this year, from Students‚Äô Union Election: Sports Secretary, Cultural Secretary, Academic representatives from Science, Commerce, Humanities and Language,‚Äù reads the notice, signed by Principal Dinesh Khattar, and Students‚Äô Union Staff Adviser Sudipta Ghosh.

The notice added that the sports and cultural activities were ‚Äúnominated by the Department of Physical Education and the Cultural Societies respectively and hence there is no need to have election for for these posts‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe election to these posts takes place through ballot papers unlike the election to the main posts, which happen through EVMs. This leads to wastage of papers and mismanaged and chaotic due to more number of candidates, which can thus be avoided (sic),‚Äù it further reads.

However, Deeksha Gangwani, member of the outgoing students‚Äô union, said: ‚ÄúThe administration should have held a discussion with the members of the students‚Äô union before taking the decision. These posts have existed for years; they cannot just do away with them.‚Äù

Principal Dinesh Khattar reasoned: ‚ÄúThere are so many posts so we‚Äôre not able to manage. We only get EVMs for certain posts, but for these paper ballots are used, so our work doubles.‚Äù He also denied charges that the students‚Äô union was not consulted.

"I was pretty confident that I would be chosen for Arjuna award this time, says Harinder Pal Sandhu","Harinder Pal Sandhu led India to their maiden squash gold medal at the Asian Games. (Source: File) Harinder Pal Sandhu led India to their maiden squash gold medal at the Asian Games. (Source: File)

Harinder Pal Sandhu, India‚Äôs top squash player has not been considered by the Arjuna awards selection panel for the third time. He has won a gold medal at the 2014 Asian Games. The Sports Ministry announced the final list on Saturday as Sandhu will be applying for the honour next year.

‚ÄúI was pretty confident that I would be chosen for the honour this time. It is deeply disappointing when you are not picked despite being a deserving candidate,‚Äù Sandhu spoke to PTI from Chennai.

Sandhu led India to their maiden squash gold medal at the Asian Games, when he and Saurav Ghosal defeated Malaysia in the final in Incheon. He has also won nine titles on the PSA pro tour.

Ghosal, being the topmost squash player in the country for a long time, has also backed Sandhu as he said that more than Anaka Alankamony, Sandhu deserves the award. Alankamony received the award in a controversial manner in 2014.

‚ÄúIf benchmarks used for Harry (Sandhu) and Anaka were the same, then Harry should have got the award ahead of her. There is no doubt about that. Harry has also won a national title while Anaka never won one,‚Äù said Ghosal.

Ghosal, Dipika Pallikal and Joshna Chinappa have already recieved Arjuna Award. Sandhu will have to show an impressive performance at the Asian or Commonwealth level to clinch an individual medal, which would increase his chances for Arjuna.

Sandhu is still confident about making it to the list for Arjuna next year, ‚ÄúWe have the Asian and Commonwealth Games next year and will try to win a medal in both the events. I am sure, after I win medals there, it will become more difficult for the committee to ignore me,‚Äù said the world number 65.

Sandhu will be featuring at the 74th senior national championship, which is to be held from next week in Greater Noida.

AITA terminates Vijay Amritraj backed CTL contract over non-payment,"Vijay Amritraj was one of the Directors of SSPL. (Source: Express photo) Vijay Amritraj was one of the Directors of SSPL. (Source: Express photo)

The All India Tennis Association (AITA) on Tuesday terminated the contract of Vijay Amritraj‚Äôs Champions Tennis League due to non-payment of annual fee of Rs 30 lakh for the 2016 season.

The All India Tennis Association (AITA) had entered into a nine-year contract with Second Serve Private Limited (SSPL), led by former star Amritraj, who was one of the Directors of the company. However, the AITA would allow them to place a fresh bid when tender will be floated next year (2018).

AITA Secretary General Hironmoy Chatterjee confirmed that the organisers have failed to pay Rs 30 lakh to them as per contract apart from 10 percent of surplus amount.

‚ÄúThey did not conduct league last year and the contract was to have it for nine years without any break. They did not pay the fixed fee of Rs 30 lakh. We had given them a chance to conduct it this year to which they initially agreed,‚Äù Chatterjee told PTI.

‚ÄúBut later on, they said that the franchises would not agree to have it for just 2017 season. They insisted that we allow them to conduct it for nine year as per the agreement but our Executive Committee rejected it,‚Äù Chatterjee.

The senior AITA official also said CTL organisers also failed to pay 10 per cent of surplus amount. ‚ÄúThey never paid that 10 per cent citing losses,‚Äù Chatterjee further added.

The AITA though will allow SSPL to place a fresh bid next year. ‚ÄúWe have told them they can apply next year, we won‚Äôt stop them. We will give them preference,‚Äù he said.

Some of the global stars such as Martina Hingis, Feliciano Lopez, Jelena Jankovic, Agnieszka Radwanska, Garbine Muguruza and India‚Äôs very own Leander Paes had competed in the League in the first two editions.

CTL CEO Arjun Rao did not take calls when efforts were made to get his comments on the development and Vijay Amritraj also could not be reached for his reaction.

Matteo Trentin beat Spaniard Juan Jose Lobato in a final straight sprint to win stage four of the Vuelta A Espana on Tuesday when Chris Froome retained the overall lead.

Italian Quick-Step Floor rider Trentin completed a hat-trick of stage wins in grand tours, adding victory in the Vuelta to the Tour de France and the Giro d‚ÄôItalia.

He rode the 198.2km route from Andorra‚Äôs Escaldes-Engordany to Tarragona, Catalonia in 4:43:57.

‚ÄúI was really looking for this stage win because I‚Äôm really going well in this last part of the season,‚Äù Trentin told reporters.

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe defiant over selection pressure,"Eddie Howe is not fazed by external pressure while choosing his squad. (Source: AP) Eddie Howe is not fazed by external pressure while choosing his squad. (Source: AP)

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe is not fazed by external pressure while choosing his squad and is only focused on doing what is right for the club, the 39-year-old said ahead of Tuesday‚Äôs second round League Cup match at Birmingham City.

Howe faced criticism for his team selections during cup competitions last season after fielding reserve players during defeats to lower tier sides, leading to early exits from the FA Cup and League Cup.

‚ÄúI am certainly not going to bow to pressure from anybody to do anything other than what is right for us,‚Äù Howe told the Daily Echo. ‚ÄúWhen I say that, what I mean is developing young players, giving an opportunity to our squad‚Ä¶Everyone cries out in this country for more chances for young players to play and, when you do play them and rotate the team, you get criticised for it.

‚ÄúSometimes, when you are in this seat, you are in a no-win situation but I will do what is right for Bournemouth and take the consequences.‚Äù

Despite their dismal results in cup competitions, Bournemouth secured their highest ever league finish at ninth last season. Howe said the league was still their main priority but that does not change their ambitions in other domestic competitions.

‚ÄòDisappointed at closure of corruption cases‚Äô,"Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh

TWO DAYS after the Punjab Vigilance Bureau had filed a cancellation report in a Ludhiana court in the alleged multi-crore city centre scam, while giving a clean chit to an accused, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, former Deputy Speaker and whistle-blower in another Amritsar Improvement Trust (AIT) scam, has said he was ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù and beseeched the higher court to intervene and take suo motu action.

Bir Devinder, a former colleague of Amarinder, said Monday that it is shocking that ‚Äúwhistle-blowers like him put their bright political career at stake and yet the institutionalised and mega corruption reigned supreme‚Äù. In the multi-crore AIT scam, Amarinder was given a clean chit last October after the Vigilance Bureau had filed a cancellation report. ‚ÄúI am shocked at the silent burial being given to these cases one by one. I stood up as a whistle-blower but why are the other pillars of the system, including the judiciary, prosecution, investigation and media, quiet?‚Äù he asked.

On why was Bir Devinder, being a whistle-blower, keeping quiet, he said he was willing to file a PIL provided a lawyer offered to help him. ‚ÄúI have contacted many lawyers but they seek a fee of Rs 10-15 lakh to contest a high-profile case like this. I am shocked that in the AIT case, the whistle-blower was never called by any agency while filing a closure report. An official of Vidhan Sabha went and told the court that the Assembly did not have any objection to the closure. Did the Vidhan Sabha ask the whistle-blower?‚Äù

Bir Devinder had raised a question in the 12th Vidhan Sabha from 2002 to 2007, on February 22, 2006, alleging a scam of Rs 360 crore to help colonisers by exempting the acquistion of land out of an 188-acre scheme. The subcommittee of the Vidhan Sabha, constituted after his question, had handed the case to the VB. The VB, had in September 2008, registered a case under sections 420 (cheating), 467/468 (forgery), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Fitness is not just a habit, it is a lifestyle; one that requires commitment and dedication so dont let monsoon dampen your spirits. Some quick and easy steps like working out indoors or getting few simpler exercising devices can do the trick for you, say experts.

Reebok Master Trainer Gagan Arora encourages you to keep your body engine fueled every day, with these simple things to keep in mind during rainy days.

* Run those miles: The body is waterproof so do not fret to take those extra laps in the rain. An outdoor workout keeps the body metabolism going and helps you stay fit and energized.

* Stay active through the day: If heading out in the rain is not your cup of tea, workout indoors. Pack in a short 30 ‚Äì 40 minutes schedule that includes a mix of squats, push-ups, planks. Apart from homemade food, add seasonal fruits and vegetables along with lean meat and legumes to your diet.

* The ‚ÄòRight‚Äô Gear: Wear bright coloured speed wick or Active Chill fitness gear and socks as they will keep you cool during humidity, dry quickly and reduce the chances of chaffing.

* Monsoon gateways: Take a break from your routine and unwind with a quick getaway during the rains. Plan a fun ‚ÄòFitcation‚Äô that includes long walks and fun outdoor games with family and friends to stay active, energized and light this monsoon.

* Vitamins are vital ‚Äì Add vitamins to your diet to keep infections at bay and maintain your energy levels. Get enough rest, stay indoors and relax if not feeling well.

Additionally, Meenakshi Subramaniyam, coach at HealthifyMe.com also added few tips.

* Stick to the same time plan for workout sessions at home. Make sure the session is 45 minutes at least.

* Start with simple stretching exercises to warm-up followed by five minutes spot jogging. Follow it up with 15 minutes of rigorous cardio to get the heart beat up and start the fat burning process. One can opt for skipping, stair climbing, hopping, jumping jacks etc. To strengthen body muscles for toning the body and preventing joints from injury, do a combination of 20 squats + 20 lunges (each leg) + 20 pushups. You repeat this set 2-4 times as per your capacity.

* Get few simple exercising devices like dumbells, skipping rope, resistance tubes etc at home and try hardcore floor exercises like planks, crunches and leg raises. You can start with a plank position for 30 seconds and repeat it again. Then lie down on your back and do 20 crunches + 20 reverse crunches + 20 alternate leg raises. Repeat this set 2 times. An indoor jog on the spot or around a house jog is also beneficial, or Leslie walks which can be done indoors.

* Yoga can be performed both indoors and outdoors. Select an airy spot in your house practice simple asanas to keep yourself fit. Yoga also helps reduce respiratory problems that are very common during the monsoon season.

*Dance workouts are fun and flexible to enjoy indoor monsoon workout.

AIADMK merger fallout: Dinakaran loyalists withdraw support to CM Palaniswami as DMK‚Äôs Stalin demands floor test,"AIADMK merger fallout: O Panneerselvam and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami (R) exchange greetings following merger of their factions in Chennai on Monday. (PTI Photo) AIADMK merger fallout: O Panneerselvam and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami (R) exchange greetings following merger of their factions in Chennai on Monday. (PTI Photo)

A day after the warring factions of AIADMK called truce and merged into one party, MLAs owing allegiance to jailed party secretary V K Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dinakaran on Tuesday expressed their unhappiness over the decision and told the Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao that they no longer have the confidence in Chief Minister K Palaniswami. ‚ÄúWe are going to initiate efforts to bring in a new CM with the help of our supporting MLAs,‚Äù Dhinakaran supporter and Andipatti MLA Thanga Tamil Selvan told mediapersons after a meeting with the Governor.

Citing ‚Äòunprecedented constitutional crisis‚Äô, principal opposition DMK shot off a letter to the Governor asking him to convene a special assembly. ‚ÄúIn the wake of 22 MLAs withdrawing support for CM, we demand for a no-confidence motion,‚Äù said DMK treasurer MK Stalin. The DMK leader also took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying PM who delivered an anti-corruption speech on August 15 has helped merge ‚Äútwo corrupt factions‚Äù in Tamil Nadu. He was reacting to allegations that the alliance was brokered by the BJP-led Central government.

Following Stalin‚Äôs demand for a floor test, at least 15 MLAs supporting Dinakaran were shifted to two resorts in Puducherry. Fresh roadblocks seemed to have appeared before Palaniswami as 10 more MLAs are likely to join the Dinakaran camp, as per sources in both camps.

READ: AIADMK crisis highlights: TTV Dinakaran loyalists head for hotels in Puducherry; 10 MLAs likely to switch camps

On Monday, the Dinakaran camp had claimed the support of 25 AIADMK MLAs, a number that could potentially risk the majority the ruling party currently enjoys in the Assembly. At present, the AIADMK has 134 legislators, excluding the Speaker out of the 234-member Assembly, while the Opposition DMK has 89 seats followed by its allies Congress with eight and IUML with one seat.

Questioning the merger of the two rival factions, Dinakaran supporter and Andipatti MLA Thanga Tamil Selvan stated that their intention was now to hold a trust vote. ‚ÄúOur intention is that there should be a trust vote. So after that a new Chief Minister will be in place,‚Äù he claimed. He also slammed Palaniswami for aligning with Panneerselvam, who had been critical of the government till very recently. ‚ÄúThe 122 (AIADMK) MLAs had made Palaniswami Chief Minister because Chinnamma (Sasikala) asked us to do so. Panneerselvam had voted against the government (in the February 18 trust vote).

‚ÄúHe wanted to split the party and topple the government. Yet you give the Deputy Chief Minister‚Äôs post to him. What is the need for that now?‚Äù he asked. Selvan also criticised efforts to overthrow V K Sasikala from the party, claiming it was she who ensured the continuation of the AIADMK government following Panneerselvam‚Äôs rebellion in February.

Meanwhile, Dinakaran announced removal of senior leader and Rajya Sabha MP R Vaithilingam from the primary membership of the party. The decision came a day after Vaithilingam, a loyalist of Palaniswami, said steps would be taken for the removal of Sasikala from the AIADMK.

Earlier, Dinakaran had described the merger as a ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù of party general secretary Sasikala. ‚ÄúIt is not a merger. It is a commercial agreement reached for self-interest and hunger for positions and to protect posts,‚Äù Dinakaran had charged.

Yesterday, Panneerselvam was sworn-in as the deputy Chief Minister and was also given the plump portfolio of Finance, among others.

PSU bank employees go on strike; services hit,"he Indian Banks‚Äô Association (IBA) had already informed customers that functioning of branches and offices may take a hit if the strike takes off. (Representational) he Indian Banks‚Äô Association (IBA) had already informed customers that functioning of branches and offices may take a hit if the strike takes off. (Representational)

Normal banking operations have been hit as public sector bank employees went on a one-day nationwide strike today to protest against the government‚Äôs proposed consolidation move, besides raising other demands. Services like deposits and withdrawal at bank branches, cheque clearance, NEFT and RTGS transactions are affected. However, operations at private lenders such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank were almost normal.

The Indian Banks‚Äô Association (IBA) had already informed customers that functioning of branches and offices may take a hit if the strike takes off. It had also asked banks to take measures in advance to minimise the impact. The strike has been called by all unions under the aegis of the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU). The UFBU is an umbrella body of nine unions, including the All India Bank Officers‚Äô Confederation (AIBOC), the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and the National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW).

Besides, protest against consolidation move of the government, other demands include no write-off policy for non-performing assets (NPAs) of corporate loans, declaring wilful default of loans as criminal offence and implementation of recommendations of Parliamentary Committee on recovery of NPAs, NOBW vice president Ashwini Rana said. The government should provide overtime for additional work during demonetisation, he said.

The UFBU, which claims membership of nearly 10 lakh across banks, requested the government for cost reimbursement of demonetisation to banks. As many as 21 public sector banks control 75 per cent of the total banking business.

President Donald Trump moves from ‚ÄòAfPak‚Äô to ‚ÄòAfPakIndia‚Äô,"US President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, US (Source: REUTERS) US President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, US (Source: REUTERS)

US president Donald Trump has put Pakistan on notice, accusing it of giving ‚Äúsafe haven to agents of chaos, violence and terror,‚Äù but also returned to America‚Äôs rehyphenation with India, asking ‚Äúhow they can help us more‚Äù in stabilizing Afghanistan.

Outlining his long-expected strategy on Afghanistan, Trump will hope that the announcement will distract from the chaos within his own White House, in which several senior officials have either quit recently or been sacked, like his chief strategist Steve Bannon.

The strategy on Afghanistan has been in the making for several weeks. As America prepares to mark the 16th anniversary of the September 11 incidents, Trump sought to stem the hemorrhaging and confusion in his administration by laying out a clear plan on how to deal with America‚Äôs longest war. But by linking his open criticism of Pakistan‚Äôs debilitating strategy in Afghanistan to India, Trump has moved more radically than several US presidents did in the past by bringing India into the arc of influence.

From ‚ÄúAfPak,‚Äù an abbreviation that referred to the Afghanistan-Pakistan twinning that characterized Obama‚Äôs take on the region, Trump has changed this to ‚ÄúAfPakIndia.‚Äù But note the emphasis on the sentence, ‚Äú‚Ä¶we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development,‚Äù which seems as if it has been written in New Delhi. This gives India the opportunity to ramp up economic assistance and trade, including air cargo, but not necessarily military assistance that it has traditionally shied away from.

The six-pillar strategy shifts the perspective from which the US sees Afghanistan. For a start, Trump has included all of ‚ÄúSouth Asia‚Äù in his world-view, which essentially means that the US will focus much more on the safe havens that Pakistan has been providing to terrorists who cause mayhem inside Afghanistan and slip away. These encompass not only the Taliban, Al Qaeda and ISIS, but also the Lashkar-e- Toiba and the Haqqani Network, which specifically target Indian assets in that country.

Second, Trump has overturned Barack Obama‚Äôs idea of withdrawal of US troops under deadlines, by saying that the ‚Äútime-based approach‚Äù will now be based on ‚Äúconditions.‚Äù Meaning, if the conditions are ripe, US troops will be pulled out and sent home. In fact, Trump is planning to send another 8900 troops to Afghanistan, although his speech didn‚Äôt mention any figures. For someone who had tweeted in 2012, ‚ÄúIt is time to get out of Afghanistan. We are building roads and schools for people that hate us. It is not in our national interest,‚Äù this determination of staying on and fixing the problem is quite a somersault ‚Äì a welcome one on Afghanistan‚Äôs part, certainly, but also for India.

Third, Trump has rightly taken the obsessive focus away from talks with the Taliban, which Obama had. By allowing the Taliban to negotiate with the Afghan administration, the Obama administration had effectively given Pakistan a say-so in in a potential settlement, since it is common knowledge that the Pakistan ISI/Army control the major Taliban leaders who still live in Pakistan. Fourth, the US president has proclaimed that he will change America‚Äôs approach to dealing with ‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond.‚Äù This sentence alone will be music to the ears of the Afghan establishment, both current and previous, which has time and again sought to make America understand that the ongoing civil war in Afghanistan is largely a result of Pakistan‚Äôs decision to keep its northern neighbor unstable.

The Afghans are sure to like Trump‚Äôs emphasis on, ‚ÄúI will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will.‚Äù This brings back welcome memories in Delhi and Kabul of Obama‚Äôs attack on Osama bin Laden‚Äôs hideout in Abbottabad in 2011. But Afghans, 16 years after the 9/11 incidents, will want to see if Trump goes beyond mere lip-service and cut funding to Pakistan‚Äôs army and ISI and impose sanctions against personnel involved in pursuing and fomenting Rawalpindi‚Äôs infamous ‚Äústrategic depth‚Äù strategy in Afghanistan. ‚ÄúIn the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner‚Ä¶But Pakistan has also sheltered the same organizations that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. ‚ÄúBut that will have to change. And that will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country‚Äôs harboring of militants and terrorists who target U.S. service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order and to peace,‚Äù he said.

Fifth, Trump acknowledges India‚Äôs importance and its significant role in stabilizing Afghanistan, but wants it to do more. He lapses into his yen for counting chips when he says, ‚ÄúWe appreciate India‚Äôs important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development.‚Äù Sixth, Trump promises to integrate all the instruments of power at his command ‚Äì political, military and economic. But that is what every American president does.

All in all, India will have to be watchful for the manner in which the Trump Afghan strategy will unfold. Delhi cannot be seen to be critical of him, as it needs him to offset the crisis with China. Moreover, Ivanka Trump is coming to India in November. Delhi will have to play along, hand-hold and help shape the manner in which ‚ÄúAfPakIndia‚Äù unfolds. Sometimes, three isn‚Äôt necessarily a crowd, it can be a reasonably managed m√©nage a trois ‚Äì especially if one partner is being put on the mat for unseemly behavior.

"Amid outrage, Philippine opposition presses President Rodrigo Duterte to stop killings","Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. (File Photo) Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. (File Photo)

Political opponents of Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday urged him to end a culture of impunity and quell a surge in drug-related killings, amid widespread anger at police over the death of a teenager. Allegations of police abuse and a cover-up in last week‚Äôs death of Kian Loyd delos Santos has caused rare outrage among a public largely supportive of Duterte‚Äôs campaign, which saw more than 90 people killed last week in three nights of intensified police operations. The grade 11 student was shot dead on Wednesday last week in a rundown area of Manila. According to a forensic expert who conducted an autopsy, Delos Santos was shot in the back of the head and ears while on the floor, suggesting there was no gunfight, contrary to an official police report. The victim‚Äôs family reject police allegations he was a drug courier.

Duterte has resolutely defended police on the front lines of his 14-month-old war on drugs, but late on Monday he said three officers involved in the teenager‚Äôs killing should be punished if found to have broken the law.

Duterte said he had seen the CCTV footage acquired by media which showed plain clothes police dragging a man matching the description of Delos Santos, to a location where he was later found dead. Opposition Senator Leila de Lima, a detained critic of Duterte, challenged the president to order the police to stop killing.

‚ÄúI dare you, Mr President, to issue a clear and categorical order to the entire police force to stop the killings now,‚Äù de Lima said in a handwritten note from a detention facility, where she is being held on charges of involvement in drugs trade inside jails. She denies the charges. ‚ÄúJust say it. Do it now, please.‚Äù

‚ÄòSTIRRED INTO ACTION‚Äô

Another senator, Risa Hontiveros, told the house Duterte had blood on his hands and ‚Äúreveled in the deaths of drug addicts‚Äù, inspiring a culture of impunity and killing. Filipinos tired of crime and drugs and supportive of the president had woken up to what was happening, she said. ‚ÄúYou had no choice but to confront his death because his narrative was compelling,‚Äù she said of Delos Santos. ‚ÄúYou felt stirred into action because you could no longer ignore the growing outrage ‚Ä¶ But Kian was not the first. That there were thousands of deaths before him and that you allowed it to happen.‚Äù

Social media users, politicians of all sides and Catholic bishops have called for an impartial investigation into the surge in killings by police, which stopped suddenly when news of the teenager‚Äôs death surfaced. The Senate will hold an inquiry into last week‚Äôs bloodshed on Thursday. Since Duterte took office, more than 3,500 people have been killed in what the Philippine National Police (PNP) says were gunfights with drug suspects who had resisted arrests. Police say some 2,000 more people were killed in other, drug-related violence that it denies involvement in. Human rights advocates, however, say the death toll in the war on drugs could be far higher than police have reported.

Senator Paulo Benigno Aquino said that without the CCTV footage, the case of Delos Santos would have gained no attention. He said Duterte should stop the killings and strengthen the judiciary, education, law enforcement and rehabilitation.

‚ÄúThere must be other ways, Mr President. There has to be other solutions to our drug menace,‚Äù he said. Separately, Duterte‚Äôs office and the military moved to quell speculation of discontent among the security forces about their involvement in the anti-drugs campaign. A shadowy group of soldiers and police on Monday issued a statement calling for Duterte‚Äôs removal for turning the security forces into his ‚Äúprivate army‚Äù and ordering them to carry out extrajudicial killings. The group did not identify its members.

Boys don‚Äôt cry: Who are men really when they are alone?,"(Illustration: Subrata Dhar) (Illustration: Subrata Dhar)

I‚Äôm 19, razor thin, restless of mind, but overwhelmingly quiet. It has been a year since my father left town on a transfer, leaving mom behind to the hapless task of raising a bitter, confrontational boy. My maternal grandfather has just died. Three days after his last rites have been performed, I arrive at his home, after appearing for an exam. Every face I encounter is sombre, there is soreness in each eye. The women look distinctly bedraggled, lifeless. The men, all of them, are absent, either physically or emotionally. I see mom through the curtains that separate men from the women, sitting in a corner, surrounded by her sisters, blank and weak. My stomach suddenly collapses on me. I feel this surge, a wet force behind my eyes. My mind is a confused tangle of emotions over what is expected of me. I turn around and place myself in the huddle of men, somehow managing not to break into tears.

For at least 25 years of my life, I did not shed a tear. Not that I was clinically recording the fact, but, as far as memory serves right, I simply refused to give in whenever a situation arose ‚Äî be it a death in the family, breakups, academic failures or even the sheer, physical pain of injury. Often my ideological tussles with dad, which I eventually lost, left me broken. Emotionally overwhelmed, I resorted to anger, even to insults, but never to the slow eloquence of wet-eyed stutters. To me, they were a mark of weakness, a ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù side that, like most men, I was raised to disown.

Masculinity means many things to many men. In my late teens, I interpreted it as the necessity to disagree or to hold a contrarian view. If dad looked west, I looked east merely because I felt I had the choice to do so. Defeats, whether physical or mental, at that age, can be jarring. Judgement is what a boy, in a crowd of hyper-masculine men, fears the most. I decided I would rather be alone than be judged, tying up with it my earliest ideas of dignity and self-respect. I made sure that while I did not gain in height, I did not lose anything in the eyes of those watching me.

The men that I came across, inside or outside home, exhibited an equal aversion to appearing vulnerable. They wanted to be strong, they believed themselves to be strong and they dismissed anything else as a sign of weakness. Auraton ki tarah roya matt karo (Don‚Äôt cry like a woman) ‚Äî is a refrain that was both an insult and an injury to the likes of us.

Years later, I realised, there was a vacuum behind each stubborn face. A vacuum, it was espoused, women were marked to fill. Six years from the day I hid from my mother in broad daylight in a room in Pune, I broke into tears over a minor disagreement with a woman. I was tired of the charade, embarrassed too. For 25 years, I had taught myself to believe that the other side of the wall was where all the ‚Äúreal‚Äù men gathered. If you found yourself on the wrong side, as I did myself now, I would be earmarked as a pushover, considered either weak or feminine, or both.

I promised myself it was a one-off, never to be repeated ‚Äî a warning, so to speak. But it was difficult to live up to that promise. I found myself breaking down more often, a lot more than expected. I started weeping as I watched movies, I cried when I longed for home and I sobbed my heart out when I failed to understand what was happening to me. It was like a dam had burst within.

Most men that boys look up to as role models are strong, stubborn characters, who radiate a kind of stony emotional strength. But what does it serve? All my life, growing up, I looked at dad and my uncles, as these incredibly sturdy men, who never wavered at moments of distress. But were they really impervious to grief and sorrow? Who were they, really, when they were alone? Did I know them? I wonder if they hid in washrooms and sobbed quietly or shed a drop in the pall of television-lit rooms when no one was looking. I wouldn‚Äôt think any less of them now if they did.

Two years ago, when my maternal grandmother died, I returned home to find my mother sobbing. This time, I did not turn my back on her. I hugged her and we wept together.

Liking different brands can make partners unhappy: Study,"If you‚Äôre the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner‚Äôs preferences, you are going to be less happy. (Source: Thinkstock Images) If you‚Äôre the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner‚Äôs preferences, you are going to be less happy. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

It may not seem like a big deal whether your partner prefers Coke or Pepsi, but scientists suggest that liking different brands can affect our happiness in relationships more than shared interests or personality traits.

‚ÄúPeople think compatibility in relationships comes from having similar backgrounds, religion or education,‚Äù said Gavan Fitzsimons, a professor at Duke University in the US.

‚ÄúBut we find those things don‚Äôt explain how happy you are in life nearly as much as this notion of brand compatibility,‚Äù said Fitzsimons.

The researchers found that partners who had low power in their relationships ‚Äì those who do not feel they can shape their partner‚Äôs behaviour ‚Äì tend to find themselves stuck with their partner‚Äôs preferred brands.

‚ÄúIf you are lower in relationship power and have different brand preferences than your partner, you‚Äôre probably going to find yourself stuck with your partner‚Äôs favourite brands, over and over again. This could lead to a death-by-a-thousand-cuts feeling,‚Äù said Danielle Brick, now at the University of New Hampshire.

‚ÄúMost couples won‚Äôt break up over brand incompatibility, but it leads to the low power partner becoming less and less happy,‚Äù said Brick.

Studies in several settings produced the same result. The researchers used brand preferences in soda, coffee, chocolate, beer and automobiles to study individuals and couples, some of whom were tracked over two years.

These results were combined with findings on relationship power and happiness.

Brick said it is likely these brand compatibility effects have steadily gained strength as brands have evolved to play a bigger role in the daily lives of consumers.

However, they are not given the same weight as other relationship-influencing factors because they are not seen as significant.

‚ÄúIf you are a different religion than your romantic partner, you know that if this is an issue you can‚Äôt work through, then the relationship isn‚Äôt going to last,‚Äù Brick said.

‚ÄúConversely, if you like Coke and your partner likes Pepsi, you‚Äôre probably not going to break up over it ‚Äì but 11 years into a relationship, when he or she keeps coming home with Pepsi, day in and day out, it might start to cause a little conflict,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner‚Äôs preferences, you are going to be less happy,‚Äù she added.

The research was published in the Journal of Consumer Research.

Anger boils over at Charlottesville council meeting,"Protesters yell during the Charlottesville City Council meeting. (Source: AP) Protesters yell during the Charlottesville City Council meeting. (Source: AP)

Anger boiled over at the first Charlottesville City Council meeting since a white nationalist rally in the city descended into violent chaos, with some residents screaming and cursing at councilors Monday night and calling for their resignations.

Scores of people packed the council‚Äôs chambers, and The Daily Progress reported Mayor Mike Signer was interrupted by shouting several times in the first few minutes of the meeting. As tensions escalated, the meeting was halted. Live video showed protesters standing on a dais with a sign that said, ‚ÄúBlood on your hands.‚Äù

After talking with members of the crowd, Councilor Wes Bellamy said the council would drop its agenda and focus on the crowd‚Äôs concerns, the newspaper reported.

Speakers, some yelling and hurling profanities, then took turns addressing the council, some expressing frustration that leaders had granted a permit for the Aug. 12 rally that had turned violent. Others criticized the police response to the event, which drew hundreds of white nationalists and other counter-protesters.

The two sides clashed violently in the street that day, largely uninterrupted by authorities, until the event was declared an unlawful assembly and the crowd was forced to disperse. Later, a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman and injuring 19 others. The death toll for the day climbed to three when a helicopter that had been monitoring the event and assisting with the governor‚Äôs motorcade crashed, killing two state troopers.

The event dubbed ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù was sparked by the city‚Äôs decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Neither a city spokeswoman nor a Charlottesville police spokesman immediately responded to questions from The Associated Press about reports that three people were arrested Monday. At one point, the crowd chanted, ‚ÄúSigner must go.‚Äù

Elsewhere in Charlottesville, dozens of students rallied Monday night at the University of Virginia in rejection of the violence. Video of the event streamed by the newspaper on social media showed students marching on the stately grounds of Virginia‚Äôs flagship public university.

The event was billed as a ‚Äúreclaim our grounds‚Äù rally and organizers said it was held to highlight the advances made at the university to end racism and discrimination in recent decades. The organizers also said via social media that they were seeking to send a message to the university leadership that more advances were still needed.

Earlier Monday, the man who authorities say drove his car into the crowd of counter-protesters Aug. 12 made a second court appearance. The Charlottesville Commonwealth‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs Office said James Alex Fields Jr., 20, appeared by video Monday. It was his first hearing on a second set of charges filed against him last week.

Senior assistant Commonwealth‚Äôs Attorney Nina Antony says a judge declined for now to set bond for Fields, who has another hearing Friday. The charges against Fields include second-degree murder. In addition to the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, police said, some of the 19 people injured when the crowd was rammed by the car suffered serious and permanent injuries. Fields‚Äô attorney couldn‚Äôt immediately be reached.

Saudi plane for Qatari pilgrims waits at Doha airport amid diplomatic dispute between two countries,"An official from Qatar‚Äôs Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) denied claims made by media outlets in the blockading nations that Qatar had refused to allow Saudi Airlines to fly Qatari pilgrims. (Representational image) An official from Qatar‚Äôs Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) denied claims made by media outlets in the blockading nations that Qatar had refused to allow Saudi Airlines to fly Qatari pilgrims. (Representational image)

Saudi Arabia‚Äôs state carrier said on Sunday it had been unable to send planes to transport Qatari pilgrims to the kingdom because it had been unable to get permission to land at Doha airport amid a diplomatic dispute between the two countries.

Qatar and Saudi Arabia, along with three other Arab states, have been locked in a political row which severed transport ties to Doha in June, but Riyadh said last week it would facilitate the travel of Qataris for the annual haj pilgrimage.

Between 2 million and 3 million Muslims travel to Mecca each year for the pilgrimage ‚Äì which every able-bodied Muslim has a duty to undertake at least once in their lifetime.

Along with reopening its land border with Qatar, Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday that King Salman had ordered the dispatch of a Saudi Arabia Airlines plane to fly Qatari pilgrims to Jeddah at his own expense so that they could go on to Mecca, Islam‚Äôs holiest city.

However, the first flight has not been able to take off from Saudi Arabia because it had not yet received landing permission in Doha, said Saleh al-Jasser, the general director of the airline, according to Saudi state news agency SPA.

He said the airline had applied for landing permission several days ago.

An official from Qatar‚Äôs Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) denied claims made by media outlets in the blockading nations that Qatar had refused to allow Saudi Airlines to fly Qatari pilgrims.

‚ÄúThe CAA received a request from Saudi Airlines in which they asked to carry Qatari pilgrims, and replied by explaining that they should coordinate with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs through the Qatari Hajj Delegation regarding this issue, in accordance with the procedures followed in the past, so that the CAA can take the necessary measures in this regard,‚Äù said the official, who declined to be named.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed transport links with Qatar in June and imposed sanctions, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran, which Doha denies.

Last week, Qatar welcomed the Saudi decision to open the frontier and provide flights for Qatari pilgrims but also said it regarded the move as politically motivated.

Saudi Arabia had already stated that Qatari pilgrims would not be affected by the travel restrictions, but some Qataris have said they faced difficulties organising the trip for the haj, which runs from late August to early September this year.

Qatari pilgrims started going through the land border on Thursday, according to Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television.

Qatar had accused Saudi Arabia of politicising the pilgrimage and complained to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion last month.

Taliban warns Afghanistan will become ‚Äògraveyard‚Äô for US,"‚ÄúAs long as there is one US soldier in our land, and they continue to impose war on us, we, with a high morale will continue our jihad,‚Äù a Taliban spokesman said. (File Photo/Representational) ‚ÄúAs long as there is one US soldier in our land, and they continue to impose war on us, we, with a high morale will continue our jihad,‚Äù a Taliban spokesman said. (File Photo/Representational)

The Taliban warned that Afghanistan would become ‚Äúa graveyard‚Äù for the United States today after President Donald Trump cleared the way for thousands more American troops to be sent to the war-torn country.

‚ÄúIf America doesn‚Äôt withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, soon Afghanistan will become another graveyard for this superpower in the 21st century,‚Äù Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan, said in a statement. He added that America should think of an exit strategy ‚Äúinstead of continuing the war‚Äù. ‚ÄúAs long as there is one US soldier in our land, and they continue to impose war on us, we, with a high morale will continue our jihad,‚Äù Mujahid said.

Trump backtracked from his promise to rapidly end America‚Äôs longest war in his first formal address to the nation as commander-in-chief late Monday, though he did not offer specifics. He said he had concluded ‚Äúthe consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable‚Äù, leaving a vacuum that terrorists ‚Äúwould instantly fill‚Äù.

While Trump refused to offer detailed troop numbers, senior White House officials said he had already authorised his defence secretary to deploy up to 3,900 more troops to Afghanistan. Earlier Mujahid had dismissed the strategy as vague and ‚Äúnothing new‚Äù. ‚ÄúFor now I can tell you there was nothing new in his speech and it was very unclear,‚Äù he told AFP.

A senior Taliban commander told AFP that Trump was just perpetuating the ‚Äúarrogant behaviour‚Äù of previous presidents such as George W Bush. ‚ÄúHe is just wasting American soldiers. We know how to defend our country. It will not change anything. For generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are fresh and we will continue this war until our last breath,‚Äù he told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location. He added that the statement proved the current Afghan government ‚Äúis a US puppet‚Äù.

The insurgents signalled their intentions minutes after Trump spoke by claiming the US embassy in Kabul had been the target of a rocket attack late Monday. The rocket landed in a field in the city‚Äôs diplomatic quarter, with no casualties reported.

Trump also lambasted US ally Pakistan for offering safe haven to ‚Äúagents of chaos‚Äù. A commander from the Taliban-allied Haqqani network, long believed to have links to Pakistan‚Äôs shadowy military establishment, told AFP that Trump ‚Äúhas proved it‚Äôs a Crusade‚Äù. ‚ÄúHis statement has proved that he wants to eliminate the entire Muslim umma (community),‚Äù he said.

Prior to Trump‚Äôs announcement the Taliban had written an open letter warning him not to send more troops and calling for the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.

"Pro Kabaddi 2017: Jaipur Pink Panthers is like a family, says team owner Abhishek Bachchan","Abhishek Bachchan is co-owner of Jaipur Pink Panthers. Abhishek Bachchan is co-owner of Jaipur Pink Panthers.

With the team registering their third win of the season in spite of the absence of senior players like Manjeet Chhillar and Selvamani K, Jaipur Pink Panthers team owner Abhishek Bachchan seemed satisfied with his team‚Äôs performance against UP Yoddha. Riding on Jasvir Singh‚Äôs late surge, Pink Panthers edged past UP Yoddha 24-22 in Lucknow.

‚ÄúIf you see Jaipur Pink Panthers tradition, then we lose our first match. So, I tell them (players) that it is our ‚Äòkaala teeka‚Äô. It is almost our tradition but I don‚Äôt know when we will break it. It is an important thing to know that it‚Äôs a sport and I tell all my teams, be it football or kabaddi, that winning or losing is a part of the game. Even if you lose, make sure you have given your best out on the mat.‚Äù

While Abhishek was in the stands supporting his side in Lucknow, it was not the first time that he is travelling with the team. During a post match press conference, the 41-year old Bollywood actor revealed that he likes travelling with the team as he feels that he can contribute in team‚Äôs success by supporting and encouraging the players. Playing their fifth game, Jaipur played in the absence of their captain Manjeet Chhillar.

‚ÄúToday we went to the mat with a depleted squad with Manjeet (Chhillar) not playing. Selvamani is also injured. And we have built our team on these two players. And it does affect the team. Moreover, Jasvir who has been with us from the beginning and the captain too and thus I always rely on him. And today he along with the youngsters stepped up and delivered.‚Äù

With the tournament to run across for three months, injuries are the major concern for the teams. When asked about the team is looking forward to cope up the absence of seniors, Abhishek said, ‚ÄúYou all don‚Äôt know that two of our other players are playing injured too but they are still playing. If I ask Jasvir to play and even if he is injured, he will be ready to play for the team. And that‚Äôs what I want to see in a team. Whether they end up playing or not, whether we rest them or not but the emotion to go and play for the team is important. And I‚Äôm proud of my team that we have such players who are ready to play in spite of not being fully fit.‚Äù

Abhishek feels his side is more like a family and not like a team and you fight for your family. Calling the win over UP Yoddha as their greatest win, the Junior Bachchan credited the youngster for a stellar show. ‚ÄúIf you look at the match, the last all out on UP Yoddha was the turning moment. From the sidelines, I was shouting at Jasvir not to try the scorpion kick. But UP played fantastically as the game was neck-to-neck. They should not be upset by today‚Äôs loss,‚Äù Abhishek concluded.

RJP-Nepal will participate in third phase of local polls: CEC,"The Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal, a coalition of six Madhes-based groups who had boycotted the first two phases of the local-level polls, will participate in the final phase next month, according to the chief election commissioner (CEC). Madhesi parties have long been demanding an amendment to the Constitution promulgated in 2015 to accommodate their main demands: more political representation for the inhabitants of the southern plains and redrawing the provincial boundaries. They had boycotted the first two phases of the polls -being held for the first time in about two decades ‚Äì over the demands.

CEC Ayodhi Prasad Yadav told reporters in Janakpur, a centre for cultural tourism about 200 kilometres from Kathmandu, that RJP-Nepal will contest the polls scheduled on September 18 in Province No. 2 as per the deal reached with the government and the main opposition CPN-UML of former prime minister KP Sharma Oli. In April, six Madhesi parties announced to jointly form the Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal (RJP-Nepal).

RJP-Nepal leader Rajendra Mahato last week, however, indicated the party might contest the third phase, saying the ruling alliance of Nepali Congress and CPN-Maoist Centre have assured them they would endorse the Constitution amendment bill tabled in the parliament. Yadav also said that the Election Commission was preparing to hold federal and provincial elections in 31 mountainous and hilly districts on November 20 and discussions were underway with the central government on the matter.

Millions of Nepalese voted in the first two phases as the Himalayan nation takes a key step towards cementing democracy. Nepal witnessed political instability when Madhesis, who are mostly of Indian origin, had launched a prolonged agitation between September 2015 and February last year against the implementation of the Constitution.

This is a remarkable work of scholarship in a long-neglected area ‚Äî state consolidation and frontier-making in the eastern Himalaya between 1910 and 1962. Unlike other books which have dealt with the high politics of the India-China relationship and boundary, it studies these issues from the ground up, from the point of view of the peoples and society. Coming when the Indian and Chinese states have accumulated hard power and are rubbing up against each other in their shared periphery, this history is a topical reminder of how we got to the present situation, and suggests alternate ways of looking at the processes of state formation and consolidation in the Indian and Chinese peripheries in the early 20th century.

The basic thesis is that existing analyses miss a fundamental element of Sino-Indian rivalry: the difficulty of coexisting in the Himalayas, a region whose distinct human landscape exposes India and China‚Äôs imperial nature. The 1962 war was preceded not just by military and diplomatic escalation, but by an older and increasingly tense shadowing contest to convince the eastern Himalayas‚Äô inhabitants that one state, and not the other, was the better alternative. Guyot-R√©chard sees India and China as post-imperial polities seeking to deepen their rule over the Himalayan region, where they encounter people starkly different from their ‚Äúcore‚Äù citizenry. She distinguishes between the behaviour of China and India. While China uses colonial policies on its geographic peripheries, independent India‚Äôs unity-in-diversity ideal coexisted with imperial strategies, and China and India see themselves as each other‚Äôs ‚Äòshadow state‚Äô in the Himalayas.

Based on research in the Arunachal Pradesh and Assam archives, original primary sources, and extensive interviews with those involved, the book naturally focuses much more closely on the Indian side, where sources are accessible. For the Chinese side, where sources are unavailable, limited or patchy, the author relies on deduction and inferred motives from revealed Chinese state behaviour. This could have opened her to the accusation that she is looking for keys lost somewhere else under a street lamp because that is where the light is. But the objectivity with which she handles the material avoids most pitfalls of this method ‚Äî of picking over Indian flaws and hesitations while the official Chinese narrative gains undeserved credence by comparison and equation. It is hard to see what more she could have done. She has obeyed the historian‚Äôs cardinal rule and followed the evidence.

The result of her considerable scholarship is an important book that covers significant themes in an increasingly important area with a professional historian‚Äôs care and precision. For instance, the book deals with the complicated and non-linear transition in the eastern Himalaya from empire to nation-state in India and China, where the process was completed in the early 20th century (and, implicitly, in Tibet where the transition from a pre-modern polity to the nation state was not completed). It describes competitive state expansion in successive episodes, the first of which, by China in 1910-12, set off what Guyot-R√©chard calls ‚Äúshadow state‚Äù behaviour, where India and China reacted and mirrored what they thought the other was doing to consolidate power and sovereignty in this border region, and not only on their side of the Himalaya.

In describing this process, she is also alert to multiple side-shows which influenced the main flow of events in unpredictable ways. One was the triangular differences between London, Calcutta/Delhi and Assam. For London, imperial interests in keeping Russia out of Tibet dictated accommodation with China, recognition of Chinese ‚Äúsuzerainty‚Äù over Tibet, and ruled out an interest in expanding into the eastern Himalaya. New Delhi/Calcutta saw the exercise of British rule and recognition of boundaries as necessary both for security and commercial reasons but were unwilling to prioritise or invest. And, Assam saw Delhi‚Äôs regular relapse into a ‚Äúpolicy of aloofness‚Äù as dangerous and sought a forward policy on the ground in terms of presence, civilian administration and development.

Another interesting theme was the impetus for the 1910 Treaty with Bhutan from Qing and Tibetan assertions of sovereignty in the eastern Himalaya, and Bhutan‚Äôs role in Calcutta and London‚Äôs Tibet and China policy. As for China, when she first tried to conquer Dzayul in May 1910 and entered the Lohit valley, the King of Bhutan was informed that his kingdom was China‚Äôs protectorate, and he was ordered to let Chinese currency circulate freely and to confine diplomatic relations to Beijing only ‚Äî plus √ßa change‚Ä¶! This first burst of Qing China‚Äôs forward policy in the eastern Himalaya was soon ended by Tibetan resistance and the fall of the dynasty at home.

Shadow States: India, China and the Himalayas, 1910‚Äì1962

B√©r√©nice Guyot-R√©chard

Cambridge University Press

This is a book full of discovered delights, of repetitive patterns of behaviour by governments in India and China. One of them is the ‚Äúrecourse to force [which] had been a long-standing way of managing vulnerability on the part of China-based polities‚Äù that several instances in the book attest to. It is particularly good on the ebb and flow of administration in the eastern Himalayan borderland. Chapters 3 and 4 reveal the development dimension and the relationship between the people and the state in NEFA. The new Indian state differed from its predecessor, but carried on its legacy. With the 1950 Assam earthquake, independent India changed the coercive state vocabulary by adding development initiatives and relief. The story of state-building is told clinically and well.

The real value of this book is its emphasis on the role of the people of the eastern Himalaya and what it says of ‚Äúever-changing state-society relations on either side of the eastern Himalayas‚Äù. It describes local peoples‚Äô preference for the looser arrangements of India over the monopolistic Chinese approach to their polities and societies. It was this preference that saw the relatively smooth return of the Indian administration into these areas after the 1962 war, despite Chinese attempts during their two to three month occupation of large parts of NEFA to demonstrate their goodwill to the people and to prove their superiority over the Indian state. Guyot-R√©chard argues that ‚Äúarguably, the PRC‚Äôs demonstration of invincibility, impeccable efficiency and self-sufficiency had been too convincing.‚Äù

The book also brings a fresh perspective to China‚Äôs military victory in 1962, which Guyot-R√©chard says could well turn out to be Pyrrhic. She argues that viewed solely in military terms or of control of territory, the victory was undeniably China‚Äôs. But why then, as John W. Garver points out, is this China‚Äôs ‚Äúforgotten war‚Äù? Is it because China‚Äôs leaders felt they miscalculated in launching it, and that it failed to resolve China‚Äôs coexistence with India or win over the populations of the eastern Himalaya? After the war, Tibetan resistance to Chinese rule continued, and NEFA‚Äôs people cooperated with returning Indian authorities. To that extent, the narrative of Chinese victory loses its shine, she points out. My own sense is that the war was at least as much an internal political coup by Mao, which succeeded, but which can hardly be acknowledged. It is probably a combination of several of these factors that explains the Chinese treatment of 1962 as the ‚Äòforgotten war‚Äô.

As China seeks to extend her strategic frontiers in several directions including the eastern Himalaya, and India seeks to maintain the natural geographic boundaries that have served her through history, this is a timely and useful book. It is also a useful reminder of the relatively recent and fragile nature of state formation in the eastern Himalaya. Internal party-political games in the Northeast, toppling governments and stretching the law beyond its capacity, and failure to meet minimum standards of governance only lays in store trouble in a situation of weak and fragile state structures and fundamental social change in our Himalayan borderland. When China is increasingly active at our periphery, when she hosts insurgent leaders from the Northeast India like Paresh Baruah, and reactivates Indian insurgent groups, it is useful to remember that this has been an arena of India-China competition for over a century, where the two countries have shadowed each other, where new states and aggressive nationalisms are yet to find equipoise, and where development has proved its worth as an instrument in the past.

We need more work like this which takes us away from the monochromatic state and sovereignty-centred view of our borders to a fuller understanding of our own past that includes the agency of the people and that show us the complexity of what we have inherited. In that complexity itself lies opportunity for the pragmatic policymaker, for the historian and for those who are prisoners of our present constricted narrative on China, our borders and the history we share. Like a true work of history, it will have served a useful purpose if it brings us to question conventional wisdom, widens our vision, and provokes more scholarship on its themes, and on the domestic and internal political dynamics that drive India and China to do what they do. Do read this book. It is of value well beyond the limited circle of academic readers that the title might attract.

Strong adolescence friendship bond may boost mental health,"Maintaining goof relationships with friends help children cope better with difficulties they face on a daily basis. (Source: File Photo) Maintaining goof relationships with friends help children cope better with difficulties they face on a daily basis. (Source: File Photo)

Worried over your son or daughter being too friendly with his or her mates? Take heart, having strong and intimate friendships during adolescence may help improve several aspects of mental health such as anxiety, social acceptance, self-worth and symptoms of depression, researchers say.

‚ÄúOur research found that the quality of friendships during adolescence may directly predict aspects of long-term mental and emotional health,‚Äù said lead author Rachel K. Narr, PhD candidate in clinical psychology at the University of Virginia.

‚ÄúHigh school students with higher-quality best friendships tended to improve in several aspects of mental health over time, while teens who were popular among their peers during high school may be more prone to social anxiety later in life,‚Äù Narr added.

The study, published in the journal Child Development, looked at a community sample of 169 adolescents over 10 years, from the time they were age 15 to when they were 25.

The youth were racially, ethnically and socio-economically diverse, with 58 per cent Caucasian, 29 per cent African American and eight per cent of mixed race or ethnicity and with median family income $40,000 to $59,999.

Adolescents were assessed annually, answering questions about who their closest friends were, reporting on their friendships and participating in interviews and assessments exploring such feelings as anxiety, social acceptance, self-worth and symptoms of depression.

Researchers found that teens who prioritised close friendships at age 15 had lower social anxiety, an increased sense of self-worth and fewer symptoms of depression by the time they reached age 25 than their peers.

Neither having a strong friendship nor being more popular predicted short-term changes in mental health, the researchers noted. The researchers suggested that this may be because positive experiences with friends help bolster positive feelings about oneself during a stage of life when personal identity is being developed.

Also, close friendships may set adolescents on a trajectory to expect and therefore encourage supportive experiences in the future.

Lalchand Rajput not offered contract extension by Afghanistan,"Lalchand Rajput was coach of Afghanistan since June. Lalchand Rajput was coach of Afghanistan since June.

Former India batsman and coach of the Afghanistan cricket team Lalchand Rajput will not get a contract extension, according to the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB). The Board on Sunday confirmed that the Indian will not coach the senior national team beyond August this year.

Rajput was hired as the coach of the team in une last year after former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq stepped down as coach. He was given a one-year contract.

‚ÄúACB would like to thank Mr. Rajput for his satisfactory performance during his time as Afghanistan‚Äôs Head Coach,‚Äù a statement read. ‚ÄúACB is currently in the process of recruiting a new coach for the National Cricket Team.‚Äù

Under coach Rajput, Afghanistan have had huge success including attaining a full-membership from International Cricket Council which allows them to play Test cricket. In one-day internationals and T20 internationals, Afghanistan won six out of their 10 series under Rajput including wins over Ireland and Zimbabwe. They lost a series to Bangladesh but defeated West Indies in an ODI which is their first win over a Test playing nation other than Zimbabwe and Bangladesh.

Last year, Afghanistan had defeated Scotland, drew a series against Ireland and lost a series to Bangladesh. They won the Intercontinental Cup against Ireland in Greater Noida. In all likelihood, they will play their first Test match against Zimbabwe later this year.

In an exclusive interview to http://www.aiff.com, Passy said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt travel around the world only to compete but not win. Obviously, our first priority is to win. First, we will try to conquer Mauritius tomorrow and then win the game against India. We‚Äôll take one game at a time.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get the opportunity like this everyday. The Challenge lies in playing outside our continent, our comfort zone. The character of the players will be significant‚Äù, he added.

On playing India, a higher ranked team, Passy said, ‚Äú4 months back, we were 70 and India were much below than us. Now, it‚Äôs the other way around. Frankly speaking, I don‚Äôt prefer to buy the ranking formula. The game is played on the pitch and it‚Äôll always be so. Rankings are irrelevant.‚Äù

He, however, was all praise for Indian hospitality saying, ‚ÄúThe Indian hospitality has been excellent so far in all true senses. Whoever we‚Äôve interacted to appeared so dearer and nicer to us, we can‚Äôt think of complaining about anything. We‚Äôre already started to feel at home.‚Äù

St. Kitts & Nevis will first play Mauritius on Tuesday at 5.30 pm.

Patrick Patterson: Journey in finding one of West Indies‚Äô most lethal bowlers,"Updated: July 23, 2017 1:20 pm

The most fearsome of Caribbean pacers disappeared into oblivion in the 1990s. Patrick Patterson is still around, though he does not quite remember the man he was, or his bowling spells which went down in history. But he is grateful for the dogged fan who travelled half-way around the world to his door ‚Äî to hear his story.

There had been murmurs around about Patterson‚Äôs present state ‚Äî that he‚Äôs lost in the bush or is in an asylum; maybe, even roaming the streets as a destitute."
"Deepika Padukone‚Äôs colour-block shirt isn‚Äôt impressive at all, but her denims are way too cool","Deepika Padukone spotted at Mumbai airport. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries) Deepika Padukone spotted at Mumbai airport. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

Looks like simple button-down shirts are a thing of the past now. We were still trying to get our heads around how to pair a deconstructed shirt but with fashion trends changing so often, we were presented with a new dilemma ‚Äì on how to wear a colour-block shirt. In all fairness, if we would have spotted this dual-tone summer wear while out shopping, we would have never gone for it. But Deepika Padukone being the fashion chameleon she is, decided to add it to her wardrobe. She stepped out at the airport in a half gingham print and half pastel blue shirt and even though we applaud her for her sartorial experiment, it just failed to impress us.

However, she totally aced her denim game in the fanciest and coolest pair ever! The 70s-inspired flared jeans are having a huge moment right now and Padukone took it to the next level with this one ‚Äì we love how it‚Äôs frayed at the ankles.

You can pair it with almost anything, starting from statement tees to tank tops and halter-necks ‚Äì just make sure that your top isn‚Äôt baggy. You can complement your look like the Padmavati actor with a pair of Nike slides, minimum make-up, an updo and a pair of sunglasses.

This particular travel look isn‚Äôt our favourite but a couple of days back, she aced her airport style in basics.

The white top (from Purple Paisley) and blue jeans (From Zara) combo is a classic and we love the way she casually shrugged on that denim jacket to add oomph to her too-cool-for-school look. The statement, ankle length boots and a pair of blue aviators made all the difference. It‚Äôs something we would definitely like to try the next time we are jet-setting.

Pack right before travelling during monsoon season,"Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for nigh t time. (Source: File Photo) Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for nigh t time. (Source: File Photo)

Before going on a trip during the rainy season, it is important to carry the right tools and instruments to save your belongings like cellphone and wallet from drenching. Carry zip lock bags, umbrellas, mosquito repellents and waterproof backpacks, suggest experts.

Narayana Menon K, co-founder at Wandertrails, an online platform enabling discovery and booking of experiences, has listed a few necessary items:

* Arm yourself with an umbrella or raincoat. A waterproof backpack is a must-have.

* Always carry a zip lock bag. It is good to keep the wallet and other expensive belongings safe as well like the smartphone and maybe other equipments like camera and lenses.

* It is the season when mosquito-borne diseases are rampant with stagnant puddles and blocked drains everywhere. Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for night time.

* It is best to carry own water, otherwise, drink only boiled water. The same goes for food, don‚Äôt eat from just anywhere. Street food is extremely difficult to say not to, at least make sure it is covered.

* Carry light synthetic clothes that will dry easily.

* Floaters and sandals are the best options in terms of footwear.

Inputs from Aloke Bajpai, CEO at ixigo, travel search engine:

* Having street food during the rainy season can be very unhygienic. Carry sachets of herbal teas and packaged food. Also, don‚Äôt drink water from unsealed bottles or the regular running tap.

* Always carry a first-aid box in case of an emergency. The probability of catching cold and falling sick during the rainy season is more than during any other time of the year.

* If planning to visit a new destination, always know how you can get help if stranded ‚Äì the intensity of rain that the region receives, and emergency contact information of the local authorities. It is advisable to make reservations beforehand to ensure a safe journey.

* Chances of a power outage during a rainy day are more as compared to normal days. To keep phone active, it‚Äôs important to carry a power bank all the time.

* As it might get dark early, keep a flashlight. Don‚Äôt rely on the phone‚Äôs flashlight.

* It‚Äôs good to carry some extra plastic bags to keep electronics safe. They can also be used to keep wet clothes and food items.

"The victor, the spoils? Donald Trump eyes Afghanistan‚Äôs elusive mineral riches","US President Donald Trump. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque US President Donald Trump. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

U.S. President Donald Trump is eyeing Afghanistan‚Äôs mineral wealth to help pay for a 16-year war and reconstruction efforts that have already cost $117 billion. Investors who have studied the country, one of the world‚Äôs most dangerous, say that is a pipe dream. Ever since a United States Geological Survey study a decade ago identified deposits later estimated to have a potential value of as much as $1 trillion, both Afghan and foreign officials have trumpeted the reserves as a likely key to economic independence for Afghanistan.

As well as deposits of gold, silver and platinum, Afghanistan has significant quantities of iron ore, uranium, zinc, tantalum, bauxite, coal, natural gas and significant copper ‚Äì a particular draw given the dearth of rich new copper mines globally. Afghanistan, some reports say, even has the potential to become ‚Äúthe Saudi Arabia of lithium‚Äù, thanks to deposits of the raw material used in phone and electric car batteries.

But a lack of basic logistics ‚Äì paved roads and rail links needed to export copper concentrate or iron ore ‚Äì pervasive corruption, a messy bureaucracy and a growing insurgency that has left much of the country beyond the writ of the Kabul government have stifled attempts to a build a legitimate mining sector. Much of the basic data dates back to the Soviet occupation in the 1980s. And the cost of having foreign geologists and engineers visit remote sites to carry out new surveys is prohibitive when nothing is yet being produced to pay for it.

‚ÄúThere is no low-hanging fruit that could trigger rapid growth and foster self-sustaining development,‚Äù said the government‚Äôs own National Peace and Development. Framework document, presented at last year‚Äôs donor conference in Brussels. Major projects such as the Mes Aynak copper mine, being developed by a Chinese consortium, remain at a standstill. ‚ÄúThere is zero active mining and very little exploration, if any,‚Äù says Leigh Fogelman, director at merchant bank Hannam & Partners in London. The bank‚Äôs founder, former JP Morgan rainmaker Ian Hannam, has been a long-time investor in Afghanistan through the Afghan Gold and Minerals Company (AGMC).

AGMC won the licence for another copper deposit, at Balkhab in northern Afghanistan, in 2012. For the rest, resources have been prey to what William Byrd, a development economist with the United States Institute of Peace, has dubbed ‚Äúindustrial-scale looting‚Äù. While small and medium-sized mines do exist, many are outside government control, profiting powerful local operators and depriving the treasury of what the government estimates at $300 million in unpaid taxes. ‚ÄúThe big mining opportunities are just languishing and there‚Äôs looting of smaller resources everywhere,‚Äù Byrd said.

GREAT GAME

As Afghan officials sought to raise interest in Afghanistan with the incoming U.S. administration earlier this year, they pushed the idea of the mineral reserves. ‚ÄúPresident Trump is keenly interested in Afghanistan‚Äôs economic potential,‚Äù Hamdullah Mohib, Afghanistan‚Äôs ambassador to Washington, told Reuters in June. ‚ÄúOur estimated $1 trillion in copper, iron ore, rare earth elements, aluminium, gold, silver, zinc, mercury and lithium. That‚Äôs new.‚Äù

U.S. officials have told Reuters that Trump argued at a White House meeting with advisors in July that the United States should demand a share of Afghanistan‚Äôs mineral wealth in exchange for its assistance to the Afghan government. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that Trump has made a decision on the United States‚Äô strategy for Afghanistan after a review with national security advisors, but did not give any details.

It is easy to see why the mining sector has aroused so much interest in Afghanistan, a landlocked country with an economy worth about $20 billion a year ‚Äì roughly half the size of Wyoming, the least populous U.S. state. But private investors are wary, says Fogelman, and there is no quick fix. ‚ÄúIn the case of large, public sector investment, the situation would be different ‚Äì however, there would still be the problem of building up logistics and export links,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI reckon it would still likely take years to get a meaningful large-scale operation going.‚Äù

Even if private armies could be hired to defend the mines against insurgent attack, the cost of moving minerals out would likely be prohibitive until the entire country was secure ‚Äì which could take many years. One longtime mining expert formerly based in Kabul recounted his conversation with a top mining firm. ‚ÄúThey said: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, we can bring our own security detail and do the mining operation‚Äô. But, they said, ‚ÄòHow are we going to get this stuff out of the country?'‚Äù

According to a 2014 mining ministry study, some of Afghanistan‚Äôs most promising deposits of lithium are in the eastern province of Ghazni and in the far southern region of Gowde Zereh in Helmand province, all areas largely under the control of the Taliban. ‚ÄúThe idea that this will materialize in the near future and pay for the security sector budget is unrealistic,‚Äù said Byrd.

Even without the war, mining is tough. China acquired a 30-year lease on the Mes Aynak copper mine for around $3 billion in 2008 but, although the Taliban has explicitly declared that it will not target it, the project has been plagued by delays due to contractual wrangling. Under a donor programme agreed in Tokyo in 2012, Afghanistan was supposed to be earning $1 billion a year from mining revenues by 2017 but expectations have been pulled back.

In the first 11 months of the last fiscal year, the government raised just $18 million from mining revenues and the government‚Äôs own projections now do not see them exceeding the $1 billion mark before 2029. That compares with security spending of $4.6 billion this year, equivalent to almost a quarter of the total budget. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs illusory to think that minerals will save Afghanistan in any foreseeable future,‚Äù said one senior Western diplomat in Kabul.

Sandesh Jhingan is a fighter like me who loves to lead the side from the front: Stephen Constantine,"Indian football team coach Stephen Constantine and captain Sandesh Jhingan during a press conference in Mumbai. (Source: PTI) Indian football team coach Stephen Constantine and captain Sandesh Jhingan during a press conference in Mumbai. (Source: PTI)

India football coach Stephen Constantine is highly impressed with newly-appointed captain Sandesh Jhingan and feels he has what it takes to excel in the bigger league. Ahead of the tri-nation tournament fixture against St Kitts and Nevis, Constantine was full of praise for Jhingan.

‚ÄúThe captain has to reflect the character of the team. He has to set the tone of the team. Sandesh is a fighter like me who loves to lead the side from the front,‚Äù Constantine said. Jhingan had made his first India outing against Nepal, which was also Constantine‚Äôs first match as coach in his second term.

‚ÄúSandesh, to me, is a player who should be playing in a bigger league,‚Äù Constantine said.

India beat Mauritius 2-1 in Jhingan‚Äôs first match in charge but the skipper didn‚Äôt have much to say after the win. ‚ÄúPlaying for your country is itself a great honour and here I am, leading my country,‚Äù he stated.

He has played a key role in the back-four with Anas Etathodika, Pritam Kotal, Narayan Das and Gurpreet Sandhu (in goal) and helped India create a new record of winning nine international matches on the trot. This also includes the unofficial fixture against Bhutan.

Very impressed with his new captain, Constantine said Jhingan could be identified as a leader after Sunil Chhetri calls it a day.

‚ÄúIn coming days, at least we can identify Sandesh as a leader once Sunil (Chhetri) hangs his boots,‚Äù Constantine said.

Chhetri to join camp

Chhetri, Gurpreet and Udanta Singh will be joining the national camp after Bengaluru FC‚Äôs AFC Cup stint. India have won both their matches in the AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers and will now take on Macau, in Macau, on September 5.

Pune: Heart transplants give new lease of life to two,"Representational Image Representational Image

A 13-year-old girl, who had suffered a heart failure, got a second chance at life when doctors performed a heart transplant at Fortis Hospital in Mulund on Sunday. The transplant was followed by another one: of a 22-year-old boy who was declared brain dead after suffering a fall while breaking the ‚ÄúDahi Handi‚Äù at a programme in Surat.

Dr Anvay Mulay, head of the cardiac transplant team at Fortis hospital, performed the heart transplant. Pune-based cardiovascular surgeon Dr Sanjeev Jadhav performed the paediatric heart transplant. The girl was on her death bed, said Dr Jadhav, adding that the donor heart was from a 47-year-old woman in Mumbai, who had suffered Intracranial Bleed. Upon declaration of brain death, immediate family consented for heart and liver donation. Dr Anvay Mulay, head of Cardiac Transplant team at Fortis Hospital, Mulund, conducted the transplant.

The second transplant was enabled by a donor from Surat. Admitted at New Civil Hospital, Surat, the 22-year-old male had a fatal fall during Dahi Handi celebrations and was subsequently declared brain dead. His brother consented for his liver, heart and kidneys‚Äô donation. The heart recipient was a 16-year-old female from Malegaon, who had suffered from Dilated Cardiomyopathy.

Defending champion Dipika Pallikal on Tuesday pulled out of the 74th Senior National Squash Championship beacuse of an ankle strain. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unfortunate that I have to pull out. As I have an important season coming up, I thought I needed to be fully fit before the new season starts,‚Äù Pallikal said while talking to PTI.

Eyeing the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games next year, Pallikal insisted that to be properly ready for future competitions, she needs time to heal up her ankle injury.

‚ÄúWe all have an important year coming up, next year is a huge year for us as we have the CWG and Asian Games, so I feel that to be properly ready for the season I needed to give my ankle some time to heal before I rush to match practice. I will definitely miss playing the nationals as I was looking forward to defending my title,‚Äù the 25-year-old added.

The organisers of the event have kept equal prize money of Rs 1.5 lakh each for men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs winner. Talking about the same, Joshna Chinappa suggested that she would play irrespective of the prize money.

‚ÄúPlaying the Nationals has always been important for me. It is great that there is equal prize money now but honestly, I would play irrespective of the prize money,‚Äù said Chinappa.

‚ÄúHowever, I do hope that having equal prize money can attract a lot more youngsters to the game in the next five to 10 years. That will be indeed a positive,‚Äù she added.

Viceroy‚Äôs House movie review: This Huma Qureshi starrer is like a stilted play,"Viceroy‚Äôs House movie review: Gurinder Chadha isn‚Äôt just content with a political drama. Her film deploys all. Viceroy‚Äôs House movie review: Gurinder Chadha isn‚Äôt just content with a political drama. Her film deploys all.

Viceroy‚Äôs House movie cast: Hugh Bonneville, Gillian Anderson, Manjit Dayal, Huma Qureshi, Om Puri, Michael Gambon, Simon Callow

Viceroy‚Äôs House movie director: Gurinder Chadha

Viceroy‚Äôs House movie rating: 2 Stars

The summer of 1947 was especially hot, ‚Äúhottest in 75 years‚Äù. One man who had never set foot in India before was brought in his double-breasted suit to work with a team and, in five weeks, draw a line dividing the country into two. He sweated and protested his way through it, as the likely bloodshed his actions would wrought played out on the streets.

If only Sir Cyril Radcliffe (Callow) was the story.

As the countdown to the Partition began, among the things to be apportioned, in the ratio of 80:20 between India and Pakistan, were the cutlery, musical instruments, and books at Viceroy‚Äôs House.

If only the division was the story.

As the well-meaning Mountbattens, ‚Äúwho everyone liked‚Äù, realised the impossibility of the task they had been handed, they hastened the British exit in the deluded hope that it would end the violence.

If only the Mountbattens‚Äô delusion was the story.

Rather, the Viceroy‚Äôs House, on one of the world‚Äôs greatest tragedies, one that holds personal pain for Gurinder Chadha ‚Äî one of her aunts starved to death in the mass migration ‚Äî is like a stilted play, that at its best stirs itself up to an insipid British TV costume-drama. If drama can be used for it.

Given the scale of the Partition, it perhaps wasn‚Äôt a bad idea to tell it through the viceregal mansion (now Rashtrapati Bhavan), which lay at the start of that line. However, Chadha isn‚Äôt just content with a political drama. Her film deploys all: an Upstairs Downstairs (the TV show) kind of look at the outgoing British rulers, and their still obedient Indian servants, now divided along religious lines; instant history lessons through one-liners thrown in at intervals (‚Äúdivide and rule‚Äù etc); and, most incongruously, a passionless love story between a Hindu man (Manish Dayal) and a Muslim woman (Huma Qureshi) employed in the service of the Mountbattens. As if the tragedy of what was playing out outside wasn‚Äôt enough to drive the story. There is even a third angle to that affair: the woman‚Äôs betrothed, who happens to be Mohammed Ali Jinnah‚Äôs driver.

Even if Chadha had been able to piece together all the things she is juggling here, along with an impressive Gandhi, a flailing Nehru and a casual Jinnah, who drop by at times, Viceroy‚Äôs House could have had a chance. However, the three strands, along with the strained staff of the Viceroy‚Äôs House, never gel. Once in a while, the director also turns her attention to the Mountbattens, who make for a more compelling story, if only because Anderson, despite that forced gait and walk, portrays Edwina as the only one aware of how their name is going down in history.

But is history really on Chadha‚Äôs mind? A document pulled out of a drawer, showing a Partition plan as far back as 1945, blamed on Winston Churchill, as a British grand design to contain the Soviets, is passed off as ‚Äúreal fact‚Äù. It waters down even that diluted effort at Nehru/Jinnah/Gandhi clash, making Partition inevitable, that Viceroy‚Äôs House makes earlier.

The film wisely declares ‚Äòhistory is written by the victors‚Äô. The above Churchill ‚Äòfactoid‚Äô is taken from a little-known book by a former Indian diplomat, Narendra Singh Sarila, who was once a junior member of Mountbatten‚Äôs staff. Well, Churchill did lose the 1945 elections.

BSE to ‚Äòcompulsorily‚Äô delist 200 companies,"The BSE has decided to ‚Äúcompulsorily‚Äù delist 200 firms this week and bar their promoters from the markets for 10 years, as trading in these shares have remained suspended for over a decade. These companies will be delisted from August 23.

‚ÄúConsidering an average of Rs 10 crore of public money stuck in a delisted company, investors would lose around Rs 2,000 crore in these 200 companies. Although the promoters of these companies are required to buy back shares from investors, many of them are unlikely to come out with any such offers,‚Äù said a market source.

The move also comes at a time when the market regulator Sebi and exchanges are clamping down on shell companies ‚Äî listed as well as unlisted ‚Äî for allegedly being used as conduits for illicit fund flows. Earlier this month, Sebi directed exchanges to act against 331 suspected ‚Äúshell companies‚Äù, while the government has already deregistered more than 1.75 lakh firms that have not been carrying out business activities for long.

Among the firms to be delisted are Eupharma Laboratories, Athena Financial Services, Magnus Rubber Industries, Rajasthan Polyesters, Transpower Engineering, Dupont Sportswear, Dynavox Industries and GDR Media. Majority of these companies have remained suspended for more than 10 years and are ‚Äúunder liquidation‚Äù.

These firms will be ‚Äúdelisted from the platform of the exchange, with effect from August 23, 2017 pursuant to order of the delisting committee of the exchange in terms of Sebi (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations‚Äù, the BSE said in three separate circulars.

Under the delisting regulations, the delisted company, its whole-time directors, promoters and group firm would be debarred from accessing the securities market for 10 years from the date of compulsory delisting. Promoters of these delisted companies will be required to purchase the shares from the public shareholders as per the fair value determined by the independent valuer appointed by the BSE.

Further, these companies will be moved to the dissemination board of the exchange for 5 years as advised by the Sebi.

Author Akhil Sharma talks about short stories and compelling characters,"The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo) The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo)

The greatest challenge for a short story writer, says one of the foremost names in the field ‚Äî who might not be too well known in India but has built up an impressive resume in the US ‚Äî is to stick to its ideal length, with the writer captivating his readers in a way that they have no desire for more.

‚ÄúKnowing that a story is only 15 or 20 pages means that you are restricted in how many characters you can have or situations you can entertain. This means that the entry into the story has to be so strong that the reader has no desire for more,‚Äù Akhil Sharma told IANS in an email interview from New York.

The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. He maintained that once a writer goes beyond this length, the stories begin to take the shape of novellas. But temptation is always lurking around the corner.

‚ÄúThe problem is that characters can be so compelling that one feels the need to follow them,‚Äù he quipped.

Delhi-born Sharma, who emigrated to the United States in 1979, is certainly not among the most well-known faces of our literary fraternity but the illustrious career of this prolific author is still a distant dream for many writers.

His stories have been published in the New Yorker and Atlantic Monthly, and included in ‚ÄúThe Best American Short Stories‚Äù and ‚ÄúO. Henry Prize Collections‚Äù. Sharma‚Äôs first book, ‚ÄúAn Obedient Father‚Äù, won the PEN/Hemingway Award in 2001. His second novel, ‚ÄúFamily Life‚Äù won the Folio Prize in 2015 and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2016. ‚ÄúI began writing ‚ÄòWe Didn‚Äôt Like Him‚Äô the day after I handed in my novel ‚ÄòFamily Life‚Äô. I began it with the idea that I just wanted a story with a beginning, middle and end. I had the opening line and I had an idea for someone who wants to be a televangelist.

‚ÄúI then just began describing the character and trying to make him sympathetic. Part of this meant inventing his back story and what would be natural for him as his life progressed. I wrote one ending and it didn‚Äôt satisfy me and so I wrote another,‚Äù the author said on being asked to throw light on the journey of a short story ‚Äî from the time of its inception to its fulfilment.

‚ÄúWe Didn‚Äôt Like Him‚Äù, along with seven others, comprise his latest book. Titled ‚ÄúA Life of Adventure and Delight‚Äù (Penguin/Rs 599/190 Pages), the book is a collection of stories that focus on Indians at home and abroad and plunge the reader into what Sharma calls the unpredictable workings of the human heart.

Sharma said that he loves short stories. ‚ÄúThey are demanding and fun and there is the sense that unlike a novel, one is not held hostage by them,‚Äù he elaborated. The author further shared that his short stories have become looser with time. ‚ÄúThey cover longer periods. I find that the transition between my paragraphs is not as tight. More and more I think short stories are simply narratives where an event occurs and a character changes or does not change even though we would expect him to,‚Äù he contended.

Sharma hoped that short stories are published in newspapers like they used to be in the past, adding that they have a specific place in the world and will always remain relevant.

Allow coconuts in jail during Hindu festivals: Convict‚Äôs plea in Gujarat High Court,"A convict serving life sentence at the Sabarmati Jail has moved the Gujarat High Court seeking permission to bring coconut inside the jail during Hindu festivals.

The petitioner Gautam Ramanuj, a resident of Khadia, is serving life term for his role in the 1997 abduction case of Manish Shah in Bharuch for a Rs 1 crore ransom.

Ramanuj‚Äôs advocate Piyush Baseri said, ‚ÄúThe jail authorities think that coconuts can be used to supply bombs. But there are at least three layers of checking that the jail authorities do everyday. Our contention is to let coconuts be brought inside the jail after thorough checking.‚Äù He added that Hindu prisoners can not offer prayers without coconuts.

The High Court has issued notices to Inspector General of Police (prisons) and Jail Superintendent seeking their replies on the issue.

"Android 8.0 Oreo announced: List of smartphones, devices which will get the OS","Android 8.0 Oreo is finally here: A quick look at some of the smartphones. OEMs which will get the update. Android 8.0 Oreo is finally here: A quick look at some of the smartphones. OEMs which will get the update.

Android Oreo is official, and this version of the software was announced by Google late last night in New York. Android Oreo is also known as Android 8.0 and will eventually be rolled out to smartphones, devices across the world. Except of course, there‚Äôs the problem of Android fragmentation, which means that not all Android phones will get upgraded to Android Oreo. Many smartphones are still on Android M, which is nearly two years old, considering it was first launched in 2015.

As of August 2017, Android Nougat 7.0 was on 12.3 per cent devices, while Android Nougat 7.1 was on 1.2 per cent of the devices. Android Marshmallow is on 32.3 per cent devices, while Android Lollipop version 5.1 is on over 21.8 per cent devices and Lollipop version 5.0 is on 7.4 per cent devices.

So overall Lollipop and Marshmallow still continue to dominate the market, which is not such great news for Android as a platform. So when will Android O start rolling out for users? Here‚Äôs a look at some devices which should get the new OS soon.

Pixel, Nexus devices

Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player and Pixel C tablet were already eligible for the Android O public beta program. For users who had already installed the public beta build on their smartphones, they should get the final build by today, and it should be available in Settings. Google says the image file can be downloaded manually, and installed on the device.

The phone should prompt you about the final Google Android 8.0 Oreo build, if you are on the beta program. Do note that if you have the Pixel or Nexus smartphone, but didn‚Äôt join the beta program, then you will have to wait for sometime before the final build rolls out. Google is still readying the final carrier builds for these phones.

Nokia 8 will be one of the first smartphones to get Android O, according to HMD Global.

Nokia smartphones

Google‚Äôs list mentions HMD Global, which is now manufacturing and selling Nokia branded smartphones. HMD Global at the launch of Nokia 8 announced this will be one of the first phones to get Android O. The company claims it is already ‚Äúdeep in development‚Äù of Android Oreo for the Nokia 8 smartphone, and will roll it out quickly. Android O is also promised to Nokia 6, Nokia 5, and Nokia 3 smartphones.

Essential PH-1 smartphone

Andy Rubin, the co-founder of Android, now has a new company called Essential which just announced the Essential PH-1 module smartphone priced at $699. Google‚Äôs blog post confirms Essential is one of the firms working on Android O development.

In terms of specifications, PH-1 has a 5.7-inch QHD edge-to-edge display with no home button on the front, a 13MP dual-rear camera, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 8MP front camera and 4GB RAM + 128GB storage.

Other OEMS

Samsung, Huawei, General Mobile, HTC, Kyocera, LG, Motorola, Samsung, Sharp and Sony also mentioned on the list. Google says these OEMs will launch or upgrade devices to Android Oreo 8.0. From Samsung, the Galaxy S8, S8+ and the S7 series should get upgraded, as well as the upcoming Galaxy Note 8. HTC should also roll this out for its flagship HTC U11 smartphone, and Sony will likely introduce this for the Xperia XZ Premium smartphone.

OnePlus has also confirmed Android O update for OnePlus 3, OnePlus 3T and the latest OnePlus 5 smartphones. The OEMs will individually announce when they start rolling out Android Oreo for their smartphones.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday ordered Facebook, Google and Yahoo to respond on a plea to remove links of Blue Whale Challenge. The court also sought responses from Centre and Delhi Police on plea seeking direction to Internet firms to immediately remove links of the online game.

Last week, a bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar had expressed concern over reports of children and ‚Äúeven adults‚Äù committing suicide by playing the game. The Delhi HC wondered why adults were getting influenced by the game. ‚ÄúIf an adult is told to do a task, why would he/she go and jump from a building‚Ä¶ we are wondering why both children and adults are doing this,‚Äù wondered the Delhi High Court.

Blue Whale Challenge is an online suicide game that supposedly originated from Russia. It is reportedly inspired from the way blue whales beach themselves on shore and die. The administrators of the online game allegedly give members a set of 50 challenges to be carried out over 50 days, with the last challenge asking the user to commit suicide. The player is asked to share photos after finishing the different levels of the game. So far, the game is suspected to have claimed six in India.

In the backdrop of these deaths, last week the NCPCR, the apex body for child rights, urged parents and teachers to ‚Äúkeep a watch‚Äù on children showing abnormal and erratic behaviour due to exposure to the game.

On Tuesday, the Haryana Children Protection Commission (HCPC) issued an advisory to all private and government schools in the state to counsel students about the risk of the Blue Whale Challenge and other similar online games. The HCPC also directed the management of all schools to educate students from class 5 to class 12 about the ‚Äòdeadly, hazardous and negative impact‚Äô of the game, according to news agency PTI. The advisory also asked schools to keep a close tab on students showing ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù behaviour.

The Association of ICSE Schools in West Bengal will organise a workshop in September for all its member schools in the city to build an awareness among students regarding the misuse of social media and the risk of ‚ÄòBlue Whale Challenge‚Äô and similar online games.

Two children pulled from rubble on quake-hit Italian island,"Firefighters and rescuers pull out a boy, Mattias, from the collapsed building in Casamicciola, on the island of Ischia, near Naples, Italy, a day after a 4.0-magnitude quake hit the Italian resort island, Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2017. (Italian Carabinieri, HO/ANSA via AP) Firefighters and rescuers pull out a boy, Mattias, from the collapsed building in Casamicciola, on the island of Ischia, near Naples, Italy, a day after a 4.0-magnitude quake hit the Italian resort island, Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2017. (Italian Carabinieri, HO/ANSA via AP)

Firefighters in Italy freed a 7-month-old baby and his older brother from rubble early Tuesday following a 4.0-magnitude quake on the resort island of Ischia off Naples, and rescuers were working on helping a third brother who remained trapped. At least two people were killed in the quake that struck just before 9 pm (1900 GMT) Monday, while another 39 were injured and some 2,600 were left homeless.

The victims were an elderly woman who was in a church that crumbled in the quake, and a second person who has been located in the rubble but not yet extracted.

Video released from the firefighting service showed rescuers passing the baby, who was wearing a white onesie and appearing alert, out of the collapsed structure in hardest-hit Casamicciola at around 4 am. The news agency ANSA said cries of joy went up in the crowd and the boys‚Äô mother ran to take him.

One of the baby‚Äôs brothers was rescued some seven hours later, and quickly loaded onto a stretcher and into an ambulance.

A firefighter photo showed the boy, identified as Mattias, being pulled out of the rubble in just his underwear covered with cement dust. Firefighters said on Twitter that they had reached the other boy, named Ciro, and were working on extracting him.

The children‚Äôs father told RAI state television that boys were in a bedroom when the quake struck, while he and his wife were elsewhere in the house. The mother, who Italian media say is heavily pregnant, managed to escape through a window while rescuers helped the father.

Firefighter spokesman Luca Cari said they maintained voice contact with the two boys during the complex rescue operation to create an opening through the collapsed ceiling. The boys had been given bottles of water and a flashlight.

‚ÄúWe are in touch with both of the boys. We hear their voices and we are making ours heard to keep them calm,‚Äù Cari was quoted by ANSA as saying.

The quake hit during the height of the tourist season, and Italian television showed many visitors taking refuge in parks following the quake. Authorities began organizing ferries to bring tourists back to the mainland early Tuesday.

Together with the nearby island of Capri, Ischia is a favorite island getaway for the European jet set, famed in particular for its thermal waters. Casamicciola was the epicenter of an 1883 earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people.

Images from the quake zone show many buildings collapsed into rubble, while others showed signs of structural damage with deep cracks in exterior walls. Cars were overturned.

The extent of the damage for a relatively light quake raised questions about the quality of construction on the island in the seismically active area off Naples and the active volcano, and the prevalence of illegally built structures.

Fabrizio Pistolesi, the head of Italy‚Äôs national architecture advisory board, told SKY that many buildings on the island were built before seismic codes were adopted. He also cited the high incidence of illegal construction on Ischia and generally in the Campagna region that includes both the resort island and Naples.

‚ÄúWe know well that in Campagna, more than 200,000 homes were illegally constructed, we are talking about homes constructed in absolute scorn of seismic norms,‚Äù he told Sky TG24.

Former Naples prosecutor Aldo De Chiara told Corriere della Sera that most of the recently constructed buildings on Ischia were built without necessary permits, and many with poor quality cement. ‚ÄúWe warned about the risk of collapses also in the case of not particularly serious temblors,‚Äù De Chiara said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, what we had denounced, happened last night.‚Äù

The head of Italy‚Äôs Civil Protection Agency, Angelo Borrelli, told reporters that 2,000 people had been left homeless in Casamicciola and another 600 in Lacco Ameno. He said authorities were checking the stability of hotels to see if they could be used as temporary housing.

The quake came just two days shy of the one-year anniversary of a powerful 6.2-magnitude earthquake that devastated several towns in central Italy. The quake on Aug. 24, 2016 killed more than 250 people in Amatrice and beyond and set off a months-long series of powerful aftershocks that emptied many towns and hamlets of their people.

Riders on the storm: Six women get ready to sail the world,"Wonder women: Aishwarya Bodapatti, Pratibha Jamwal, Vartika Joshi, Vijaya Devi, Payal Gupta and Patarapalli Swathi. (Express photo by Arul Horizon) Wonder women: Aishwarya Bodapatti, Pratibha Jamwal, Vartika Joshi, Vijaya Devi, Payal Gupta and Patarapalli Swathi. (Express photo by Arul Horizon)

The girls are busy stocking up on some of their favourite things. ‚ÄúMovies, music, games, books, Kindle, laptops,‚Äù says Aishwarya Bodapatti, with a smile. It‚Äôs not exactly a long vacation, though. Lieutenant Bodapatti and five other women are preparing to go on an adventure of a lifetime ‚Äî the stuff of adrenalin addled dreams for many: to travel the world on a sailboat.

This Indian Navy initiative (the first such attempt by any navy in the world) will see the team set off on board the 56-ft-long oceangoing sloop, INSV (Indian Navy sailing vessel) Tarini, docked at Mandovi in Goa since the beginning of 2017, by end-August or the first week of September. The crew will look to complete the whole trip in about seven months with four stops in between at Fremantle (Australia), Christ Church (New Zealand), Falklands (Argentina) and Cape Town (South Africa).

Bodapatti remembers her maiden voyage to Mauritius from Goa earlier this year aboard INS Tarini. As it tossed and turned, water filled the deck and soaked the women on board. And Bodapatti found herself thinking back to the time when she had bravely opted to be part of the crew that was to circumnavigate the globe. ‚ÄúI had thought being on the sea meant just sitting back and looking at the waters. Then, our auto pilot went on a blink and the radar packed up. I felt an unfamiliar sense of dread and realised what the sea truly was,‚Äù says the 28-year-old naval officer. It was her first experience of sailing the high seas and it taught her never to take anything for granted. A BTech graduate, Bodapatti says that her schooling at the Air Force station in Hakimpeth in Hyderabad (her father worked with the CISF), had a lot to do with her choice of career.

‚ÄúI saw lots of planes flying (Hakimpeth air force base was very close by) and joining the air force first came to mind. But then I saw the naval uniform and it just looked so smart,‚Äù she says with a grin. Bodapatti‚Äôs always sought out adventure, though, whether it‚Äôs in her love for bungee jumping or river rafting.

The idea for this ambitious expedition was apparently floated a few years ago by the Indian Navy, which had already notched up records with the iconic sailboat Mhadei, commissioned in February 2009. Mhadei made two solo circumnavigations in 2009 and a non-stop one in 2013, before the Navy decided it was time to push the boundaries further. Women don‚Äôt typically go to the sea in the Navy, and solo circumnavigation would be practically unviable. Hence, the concept of Navika Sagar Parikrama ‚Äî the First Indian All Women Circumnavigation of the Globe ‚Äî was born. Almost immediately, a look-out was sounded for volunteers from the Navy.

One of the first to come on board, however, was Lt Commander Vartika Joshi, who will now lead the expedition as the skipper. ‚ÄúI volunteered for this for the same reason I joined the Navy ‚Äî to explore the oceans,‚Äù says the 28-year-old BTech graduate from Rishikesh, Uttarakhand.

Growing up near rivers ‚Äî her mother taught at a college in Rishikesh and father worked in Garhwal ‚Äî made Vartika keen to explore the waters more. ‚ÄúThe oceans were the next logical step,‚Äù she says, adding that her family was delighted when she joined the navy and again when she opted for the circumnavigation. On what qualities led to her becoming captain, Joshi says, ‚ÄúPerhaps, my ability to be balanced, not take hasty decisions and take each person‚Äôs opinion into consideration when deciding things.‚Äù

Are they prepared for the challenge ahead? The answer is a resounding yes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve undergone intensive training since 2015, not to mention the many sailings from Karwar to Porbandar within India (2015 to ‚Äô17), and Rio to Cape Town to Mauritius (2016 to ‚Äô17) on international waters,‚Äù says Lt Commander Pratibha Jamwal, 28, and a BTech from Himachal Pradesh. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been especially trained to work with the boat‚Äôs equipment and its repairs because that‚Äôs one of the biggest challenges out in the waters,‚Äù she says.

After her graduation, Jamwal had landed a job with an MNC but she opted for the Navy instead as ‚Äúbeing a pahadi I had a special inclination towards defence forces.‚Äù Labelling the opportunity as the ‚Äúrarest of rare‚Äù, she feels she lucked out with her career selection. ‚ÄúHere, we are paid to travel the world and have the best experiences.‚Äù

Lt Vijaya Devi from Manipur, another member of the expedition, says she was inspired by her father, who was with the Manipur Rifles, to take on the challenge of circumnavigation. Devi has four siblings and she‚Äôs the only girl. Her family had initial apprehensions about the journey. ‚ÄúBut once they visited me here, they melted,‚Äù she says.

Lt Patarapalli Swathi, the only married member of the crew, says she had the full support of her parents and husband, also a naval officer. ‚ÄúHe knew this would happen before marriage and was well prepared,‚Äù says Swathi, who did her post graduation in computer science from Vizag.

The Ocean Sailing Node, where the women were trained, was established in 2016. However, informally, their training had already begun sometime in 2013, aboard the Mhadei. It started to come together in 2015, when all six women were transferred from their bases and stationed in Goa, where the Ocean Sailing Node took over their training. What followed were basic sail training courses at the Indian Naval Watermanship Training Centre, and, Navigation, Seamanship, Communication and Meteorology courses at various naval training schools in Kochi. After com pletion of these, the team sailed from Vizag to Goa independently in February 2016 and then to Mauritius and back, covering a distance of 4000 nautical miles in July 2016.

‚ÄúBy now, the girls have done 18,000 nautical miles of sailing on their own,‚Äù says Captain (retd) Dilip Dhonde, under whose tutelage the Tarini crew first learned the ropes in 2015. ‚ÄúWhen I trained them, I didn‚Äôt make any concession because they were women. I always told them, the boat and the sea are gender-neutral. The challenges they throw will not discriminate between men and women, hence, the response has to be likewise,‚Äù says Dhonde, who took premature retirement from the Navy last December.

Challenges don‚Äôt always come from the sea. The drudgery of long days is a real issue. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to keep motivation levels high. During long voyages, we sing, have discussions on different issues and reminisce about our childhood and dreams for the future,‚Äù says 26-year-old Lieutenant Payal Gupta, another crew member.

‚ÄúSix people living with each other continuously has its problems ‚Äî about hygiene, food choices etc. Small things can irritate you at sea and the fact that none of us are very domesticated doesn‚Äôt make it easier!‚Äù says Bodapatti. Joshi has a solution: dividing the boat area into six parts and making each member responsible for its cleanliness, ensuring no one feels that they‚Äôre making more effort at maintenance than the others.

From what it seems, the six women team have it all figured. As they strike a pose, you hear one of them shout to the others, as they perch themselves on the deck, and make the sign of a time-out. ‚ÄúNot V for Victory, Let‚Äôs make a T for Tarini.‚Äù

Barcelona terror attack: Spain maintains alert level with reinforced security measures,"Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain‚Äôs King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain‚Äôs King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

The Spanish government decided to maintain its anti-terrorism alert level at 4 but pledged to reinforce security measures at the same time, the Interior Ministry said. The decision was made during an anti-terror meeting on Saturday chaired by Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido in the morning, Xinhua news agency reported.

A total of 14 fatalities occurred in two terrorist attacks in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Cambrils that also hurt about 126 people of 34 different nationalities. Thirteen people were killed on Thursday afternoon in the popular Las Ramblas area of Barcelona when a white van zigzagged at high speed down the busy avenue thronged with tourists, knocking down pedestrians.

On early Friday morning, the fourteenth victim, a woman, was stabbed when five people jumped out of a car and began attacking people at random on the seaside promenade in Cambrils, a town south of Barcelona. Spanish police gunned down all five attackers. Six others were also injured in the attack. As of Saturday morning, 54 injured people are still hospitalized with 12 of them in critical condition, according to Catalan emergency services.

Government of Catalonia considers the terrorist cell responsible for the double-attack has not been totally destroyed as some attackers are still at large, Catalan Minister of the Interior Joaquim Forn told reporters. ‚ÄúWe are optimistic, but the searching operation conducted by the Mossos (police authority in Catalonia) can not be considered as finished until we determine and stop all the people who are members of the cell,‚Äù said Forn.

Meanwhile, Spanish authorities identified one fugitive terrorist as Younes Abouyaaqoub. Police are searching for the 23-year-old Moroccan in Ripoll near Barcelona. The suspect has been wanted by Interpol prior to the double attacks. Confusion still reigns over the identity of the van attack driver. The police firstly thought the driver was Moussa Oukabir, one of the terrorists gunned down in Cambrils, and later they turned their attention to Younes Abouyaaqoub.

Police authorities in Catalonia said that they are ruling out the possibility that the van‚Äôs driver would join the group that carried out the attack in Cambrils. So far, four people have been arrested and are being questioned by police.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warns German foreign minister to ‚Äòknow your limits‚Äô,"‚ÄúHe knows no limits! Who are you to talk to the president of Turkey? Know your limits. He is trying to teach us a lesson‚Ä¶ How long have you been in politics? How old are you?‚Äù Erdogan said in a bitter personal attack on Gabriel. (AP/File) ‚ÄúHe knows no limits! Who are you to talk to the president of Turkey? Know your limits. He is trying to teach us a lesson‚Ä¶ How long have you been in politics? How old are you?‚Äù Erdogan said in a bitter personal attack on Gabriel. (AP/File)

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on told German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel to ‚Äúknow your limits‚Äù after he vehemently criticised the Turkish leader for interfering in Germany‚Äôs upcoming elections.

‚ÄúHe knows no limits! Who are you to talk to the president of Turkey? Know your limits. He is trying to teach us a lesson‚Ä¶ How long have you been in politics? How old are you?‚Äù Erdogan said in a bitter personal attack on Gabriel.

Erdogan had a day earlier caused consternation in Berlin by urging ethnic Turks in Germany to vote against both parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs ruling coalition in the September 24 legislative elections.

Gabriel condemned Erdogan‚Äôs comments as an ‚Äúunprecedented act of interference‚Äù in Germany‚Äôs sovereignty. ‚ÄúOf course they got uncomfortable. They all started jumping up and down,‚Äù remarked Erdogan in a speech to supporters in the southwestern province of Denizli.

Erdogan repeated his controversial call to ethnic Turks eligible to vote in the German elections not to cast their ballots for Merkel‚Äôs Christian Democratic Union (CDU), their coalition partner the Social Democratic Party (SPD) or the Greens.

‚ÄúTeach them (the three parties) a lesson in the German elections. They are waging a campaign against Turkey. Vote for those who don‚Äôt have enmity towards Turkey.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not important for us whether Germany opens its doors to us or not. We have enough doors.

‚ÄúWe will go to countries that have opened their doors and we will open our doors to them,‚Äù said Erdogan. Analysts estimate that some 1.2 million people of Turkish origin will have the right to vote in the September polls as German citizens.

Pep Guardiola left frustrated after Manchester City‚Äôs missed chances,"Pep Guardiola could not disguise his frustration with his side‚Äôs failure to convert their chances. (Source: Reuters) Pep Guardiola could not disguise his frustration with his side‚Äôs failure to convert their chances. (Source: Reuters)

It was a familiar tale for Manchester City ‚Äî waves of attacks, relentless pressure but missed chances meant Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side needed an 82nd minute equaliser from Raheem Sterling to earn a 1-1 draw at home to Everton.

In City‚Äôs defence, they had to play the entire second half with 10 men after full-back Kyle Walker was shown a red card on the stroke of halftime.

But while pleased with the spirit his team showed, City‚Äôs Spanish coach could not disguise his frustration with his side‚Äôs failure to convert their chances.

‚ÄúThe second half we made a good performance, similar like last season when we played them here. We created the chances in the first half but we did not finish them,‚Äù said Guardiola.

‚ÄúWe created chances, before their goal, three or four‚Ä¶ our amount of opportunities on target or close to target was good, we were there all the time but we never gave up.

‚ÄúAll you can do is try to create the chances. Maybe one day it will change. I think last season we were the team who made the most chances,‚Äù added the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach.

Everton manager Ronald Koeman said despite the disappointment of conceding a late equaliser he was pleased with a point from a difficult trip.

‚ÄúWhen you play at City it is always tough, how they play, how they try to play but I think the gameplan was perfect, we had a good defensive organisation‚Ä¶ it was really tough, we had good man-marking.

‚ÄúBut with the quality they have they will always create chances and you need to be a little bit lucky,‚Äù he said. That luck perhaps came with the red card for Walker but Everton faced relentless pressure from a City team down a man.

‚ÄúWe scored the goal, of course I am disappointed now to be one-nil up, 11 against 10, but I think we did wrong thing in the second half, we played too much long ball,‚Äù said the Dutchman.

‚ÄúIt is a good point. I am happy, we worked hard for that point.‚Äù

"Day-after being dropped, Mominul Haque recalled by Bangladesh","MOminul Haque has been recalled for Australia series. (Source: PTI) MOminul Haque has been recalled for Australia series. (Source: PTI)

Bangladesh have called back batsman Mominul Haque in the squad that will face Australia in the upcoming twoTest series after replacing Mosaddek Hossain who wasn‚Äôt cleared from his eye infection and the BCB president Nazmul Hassan confirmed the same on Sunday.

‚ÄúMominul is added into the squad of the first test, replacing Mosaddek Hossain,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú(Hossain) is not cleared from his eye infection. So we can‚Äôt risk him,‚Äù he said.

Haque was initially omitted from the squad. it was the first time when he was dropped since making his Test debut in 2013 and coach Chandika Hathurusinghe said that the selection has been pretty fair and all the players know what they need to do.

‚ÄúAs a coach, you have a responsibility,‚Äù Hathurusinghe said. ‚ÄúBut the player also knows what he has to do. They are working very hard on it. ‚ÄúSomebody is going to go out of the team when they are not performing. Those players not in the squad, they are still practicing. Confidence comes when we communicate with the player. There is no rule but fairness is applied for everybody,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúBangladesh cricket is not all about Mominul,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSelection is done by consistency. Some of the guys were dropped for our last Test. I won‚Äôt mention name because the team is more important, the coach said.

The two-match series will begin from August 27.

"Despite great start, Manchester United theories still need testing","Jose Mourinho has used the word ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù a lot in recent days and his side certainly seem to have a swagger about them. (Source: Reuters) Jose Mourinho has used the word ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù a lot in recent days and his side certainly seem to have a swagger about them. (Source: Reuters)

Eight goals scored, none conceded and six points in the bag ‚Äì it has been the perfect start to the season for Manchester United and they have rightly earned plenty of praise.

But before they are anointed champions-elect in August, it is surely worth asking whether or not the big question marks about Jose Mourinho‚Äôs squad have truly been answered in 4-0 wins over West Ham and Swansea?

No-one ever doubted that United, once they had signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton, would be more potent in attack and indeed his three goals in two games has confirmed that.

With Marcus Rashford‚Äôs pace a threat down the left and Anthony Martial scoring in both his substitute appearances, Mourinho‚Äôs men certainly are proving to be a goal threat.

If the reports are accurate that Zlatan Ibrahimovic is making rapid progress in his return from a knee injury and is set to sign a new contract with club, United will have plenty of options in the forward areas.

Likewise the signing of Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic has given extra bite, solidity and balance to the United midfield and some extra protection to the back-line.

Last season United drew ten games at home ‚Äì many of them matches they would have been expected to win ‚Äì and this start suggests a repeat of those frustrations is less likely this time around.

But, looking at the fixture list, which has been kind to United in early season encounters, perhaps judgment should be delayed a little.

In October, United will finally face teams who finished above them in the league last season with a trip to Liverpool and a visit from Tottenham Hotspur at the end of the month. A week later, they are away to champions Chelsea on Nov. 5.

TOUGHER TESTS

One of the big question marks about United has been their defence where Mourinho has yet to find a fixed partner for Eric Bailly.

Swedish defender Victor Lindelof was supposed to be that man but he has made a slow start to life at Old Trafford and Mourinho is currently preferring Phil Jones.

Is the United defence, with Antonio Valencia and Daley Blind at full-backs, tight enough to win a championship? We can‚Äôt really judge that from wins over West Ham and Swansea.

Furthermore, no-one ever doubted that Lukaku could stick goals past those sort of opponents but will he be able to deliver in those crunch matches?

His record last season certainly raises the question ‚Äì of his 25 goals for Everton, 21 came against the bottom 13 teams in the league.

Indeed, in his career, Lukaku has scored just one goal in 14 combined games against Chelsea and Tottenham.

Statistics can be misleading and in this case may reflect Everton‚Äôs inability to create chances for him against the top teams ‚Äì but nonetheless the Belgian‚Äôs ability against the best remains a doubt to be assuaged.

The belief is also that Matic will enable Paul Pogba to thrive in a liberated, attacking role but while there are signs this might be happening, that theory also needs testing against the highest calibre of opponent.

REACTION

Then there is the issue of United‚Äôs mental strength.

Mourinho has used the word ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù a lot in recent days and his side certainly seem to have a swagger about them. But as the manager himself noted, it is easy to be positive when you are winning.

‚ÄúThe team is confident, the team starts the game confident, the team starts the second half confident. But I want to see the way we emotionally react to losing it because it‚Äôs also another stage ‚Äì be losing and try to change a result because in this moment everything is going in our favour.

‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs not always motorway. You always find difficult roads and we have to be ready,‚Äù he said.

He also knows that his team have the extra burden of a Champions League campaign starting next month.

While United had continental duties last year, when they won the Europa League, the demands of the Champions League, even in the group stage, are significantly more testing.

Mourinho has not yet had to rest players and rotate his squad ‚Äì in other words the depth of his options, again good on paper, has not yet truly been challenged.

While the pundits may be making instant evaluations, the former Chelsea and Real Madrid manager has been around too long to fall for the trap of believing the hype.

As he put it after the win at Swansea:

‚ÄúThis time last season we had six points from our first two games and we finished sixth. This start means nothing.‚Äù

State officials have cautioned that instead of being taken in by such advertisements, home buyers must demand to see the RERA registration number of the projects.

To safeguard interests of flat buyers, the government has made it mandatory for all construction projects to be registered with the Authority before selling or advertising for the sale of flats.

Although it is mandatory for builders to display the project‚Äôs registration number with RERA in such advertisements, the Maharashtra government has received complaints of misuse of the provision. ‚ÄúSome builders are flashing advertisements announcing that their projects were RERA certified without displayed the registration number. This can potentially mislead home buyers,‚Äù said Maharashtra‚Äôs Housing Minister Prakash Mehta.

The housing minister said the problem was the most acute in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. On Monday, Mehta also directed authorities to take suo motu action against such misleading advertisements. In his communication issued to authorities on Monday, the housing minister cited the instance of one such misleading advertisement that was pasted in a Mumbai suburban railway local train.

The deadline for registration of ongoing projects with the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority ends on August 31. So far, about 13,000 projects have enrolled, said officials.

Mo Farah wins his farewell track race in Britain,"Mo Farah will become a marathon man next season. (Source: Reuters) Mo Farah will become a marathon man next season. (Source: Reuters)

Mo Farah brought down the curtain on his peerless track career in Britain by winning his farewell race on home soil on an emotional afternoon at the Birmingham Grand Prix Diamond League meeting on Sunday. In his penultimate track race ‚Äî his final run will be at the Zurich Weltklasse meeting on Thursday ‚Äî before becoming a marathon man on the roads next season, the quadruple Olympic champion outclassed a 3,000 metres field with familiar elan.

The weekend after winning 5,000 metres silver and a fortnight since his 10,000 metres triumph at the World Championships in London, the 34-year-old was presented with a more accommodating field for his domestic goodbye.

The crowd at the Alexander Stadium gave Britain‚Äôs greatest racer ‚Äî perhaps the best the world has seen too after 10 global title wins ‚Äî a rapturous reception before watching him sprint away one last time down the home straight as he won in 7 minutes 38.64 seconds.

Farah, who clocked 56.89 seconds over the last lap to ease away from Spain‚Äôs runner-up, Adel Mechaal, the fourth-placed finisher in the world 1500 metres final, told the BBC: ‚ÄúIt means everything to me.

‚ÄúThe emotion was high and I had a lot of support from the home crowd. This is what we dream of ‚Äî having a home crowd cheer you on ‚Äî and I want to thank everyone who has supported me and followed my journey.

‚ÄúI never dreamed of becoming four times Olympic champion and a multi world champion. All I ever dreamed of was competing for Britain.

‚ÄúNow I just want to continue to see what I can do on the road, without having a target on my back, and just try to enjoy it without so much pressure. I‚Äôm going to a completely new game on the roads with a new mind and I‚Äôm excited.‚Äù

Five more newly-crowned world champions celebrated their London triumphs in style, headed by Qatari‚Äôs magnificent high jumper Mutaz Essa Barshim, who produced the performance of the meeting with the world‚Äôs best jump of the year, 2.40 metres.

Barshim again demonstrated why Javier Sotomayor‚Äôs world record of 2.45 metres is under threat with his clearance that pleased him so much, he promised to leave with the high jump bar as a souvenir.

‚ÄúI knew I was in good shape. I felt good and went for it,‚Äù he said, clutching the bar. ‚ÄúThat jump was amazing, I‚Äôm taking that bar home!‚Äù

Other world champions to thrive were Greece‚Äôs Ekaterini Stefanidi, who won her 12th consecutive pole vault competition (4.75 metres) and Ramil Guliyev, Turkey‚Äôs surprise 200 metres winner, who again forged away strongly from a quality field to win in 20.17 seconds.

Croatia‚Äôs discus colossus Sandra Perkovic, who won a second world gold to add to her two Olympic golds, was again in a different league, unleashing a 67.51m winning throw, while New Zealand‚Äôs shotput winner Tom Walsh prevailed again with a 21.83m winner.

Elaine Thompson, who surprisingly missed out in London, hit her best form a fortnight too late as she raced to victory in a high-class 100 metres.

Jamaica‚Äôs double Olympic sprint champion, whose poor fifth place finish in the world championships 100 metres was one of the meet‚Äôs major surprises, clocked 10.93 seconds to remain unbeaten in the Diamond League this year.

She ousted London silver medallist Marie-Josee Ta Lou by four-hundredths of a second while bronze medallist Dafne Schippers, who also won the 200m crown in London, finished sixth in 11.22.

Wayne Rooney taunts Manchester City fans after 200th Premier League goal,"Wayne Rooney scored the opener for Everton against Manchester City. (Source: Reuters) Wayne Rooney scored the opener for Everton against Manchester City. (Source: Reuters)

Wayne Rooney took a dig at Manchester City fans after scoring the opening goal of the night and his 200th in the Premier League on Monday night. But his goal for Everton wasn‚Äôt enough for the Toffees to get all three points against City at the Etihad Stadium. Despite getting just one point from the game, instead of a possible 3, Rooney had a sly go at the City fans who have seen him celebrate here in the red shirt of Manchester United.

The former England and Manchester United captain opened the deadlock in the 35th minute as he placed Dominic Calvert-Lewin‚Äôs cross beneath City goalkeeper Ederson. The striker ran away with his hands cupped to his hears in front of the City faithful prompting plenty of angry responses from the stands.

Later Rooney wrote on Twitter, ‚ÄúAlways nice to see a few familiar faces‚Äù alongside a picture of him celebrating,‚Äù with an image of clearly angry Manchester City fans hurling profanities at the striker.

A photograph later circulated showing Rooney celebrating a United goal at the Etihad Stadium and in front on the same section of supporters in 2012. Incidentally, there were a handful of City fans seated in the same seats as they were on Monday.

City drew level in the second with Raheem Sterling scoring in the 82nd minute. Everton let go of a big chance to get all three points with City reduced to ten men following the dismissal of Kyle Walker. But Everton were down to ten, too, after Morgan Schneiderlin was sent off.

Rooney even teased Manchester City after the match when, asked on Sky Sports, what it was like to score against the club for the ninth time, he replied: ‚ÄúWhat, again?‚Äù

"NEET PG 2016 illegalities: Delhi High Court seeks Centre, police reply on probe plea","Delhi High Court Delhi High Court

The Delhi High Court today sought the response of the Centre and the police on a plea that demanded a court-monitored CBI/SIT probe into the alleged illegalities in the National Eligibility Entrance Test held in 2016 for admitting students in post-graduate medical courses. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice CHari Shankar also issued a notice to the National Board ofExamination (NBE), the Medical Council of India, M/s Prometrics Private Ltd and the CBI on a plea which sought tohand over the case to the probe agency.

M/s Prometrics Private Ltd had sub-contracted with CMS IT Services Private Ltd to hire engineers, site supervisors and other staff to prepare exam labs for conducting NEET PGexamination at 43 centres across the country. The bench also expressed concern over the delay in concluding the investigation and said ‚Äúthis is a very serious matter. Therefore, the authorities need to file their status report/response in one week.‚Äù

The court, which listed the matter for further hearing on September 10, was hearing a petition filed by Dr Anand Rai, who claims to be the whistleblower in Vyapam scam.

Rai, through his counsel Vaibhav Srivastava, submitted that the crime branch of Delhi Police was not competent to handle the investigation of this nature which required technical expertise. The petitioner said that at this point of time, Delhi Police was acting like a ‚Äúpost office, still awaiting technical data from NBE and M/s Prometrics Ltd and asking Delhi Lt Governor to provide a technical team for analysis of the technical data.‚Äù

The CBI‚Äôs special standing counsel Rajdeepa Behura said the police‚Äôs crime branch was already investigating the matter in which a FIR has been lodged and charge sheet filed. An FIR was lodged on February 1 against 11 persons and charge sheet was filed on July 9 this year under various sections of the IPC including 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) and under the Information and Technology Act.

The plea sought transfer of investigation from the crime branch to Special Investigative Team (SIT) comprising members having expertise in Computer Science and/or an investigation by the CBI or any other competent central agency.

It alleged that till date, NBE and Prometrics have not cooperated with the investigation and no information with respect to technical details as sought by the police has been furnished, thus delaying the matter and providing time to the culprits to erase the evidence.

‚ÄúFurther, it appears that the officials of the NBE and Prometrics may be involved in the scam, thus making the present issue as sensitive and to ensure the cooperation of the NBE and Prometrics, a court-monitored investigation is warranted,‚Äù it claimed.

It has also sought direction to the NBE to initiate appropriate proceedings against the candidates whose names have been disclosed in the charge sheet for allegedly securing admissions in NEET-PG, 2017 using unfair or fraudulent means.

It also sought directions to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare that NEET examination is conducted by a public authority with proper oversight and involvement of government officials.

Bangladesh sends back Rohingya boat carrying injured,"A coastguard patrol boat found the boat on the Naf river, which acts as a border between Bangladesh and Myanmar, as it tried to enter Cox‚Äôs Bazar early in the morning. A coastguard patrol boat found the boat on the Naf river, which acts as a border between Bangladesh and Myanmar, as it tried to enter Cox‚Äôs Bazar early in the morning.

Bangladesh coastguards today turned back a boat carrying 31 Rohingya Muslim refugees escaping renewed army activity in their neighbouring Myanmar homeland, an official said. The push-back came after at least 500 Rohingya fled their villages in Myanmar‚Äôs Rakhine state, crossing the border to take shelter in refugee camps and hills in Bangladesh‚Äôs southeastern Cox‚Äôs Bazar district.

A coastguard patrol boat found the boat on the Naf river, which acts as a border between Bangladesh and Myanmar, as it tried to enter Cox‚Äôs Bazar early in the morning. The refugees included women and children who said they were victims of violence, coast guard spokesman Sheikh Fakhr Uddin said quoting the escapees.

‚ÄúWe found two injured among 18 men, along with nine women and four children. But we had to send them back,‚Äù Uddin told AFP. The latest influx follows a months-long bloody military crackdown on the mainly Muslim minority in Myanmar that led tens of thousands to flee across the border. The United Nations has said the violence may amount to ethnic cleansing.

‚ÄúWe have beefed up our patrol on the Naf as (Myanmar) army is gathering in the bordering villages, which may prompt them (Rohingya) to try coming to Bangladesh,‚Äù Uddin said. Dhaka estimates that nearly 400,000 Rohingya refugees are living in squalid refugee camps and makeshift settlements in Cox‚Äôs Bazar, which borders Rakhine.

Their numbers swelled last October when more than 70,000 Rohingya villagers began arriving, bringing stories of systematic rape, murder and arson at the hands of Myanmar soldiers. Last week, the UN special rapporteur Yanghee Lee voiced alarm at reports that a Myanmar army battalion had flown into Rakhine to help local authorities boost security in the region.

Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long faced criticism for its treatment of the more than one million Rohingya who live in Rakhine, who are seen as interlopers from Bangladesh, denied citizenship and access to basic rights.

But they are also increasingly unwelcome in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, where police often blame them for crimes such as drug trafficking. Dhaka has floated the idea of relocating tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees to a remote, flood-prone island off its coast, despite opposition from rights groups.

Lemons were status symbol in ancient Rome,"The first remains of the earliest lemon, found in the Roman Forum, date to right around the time of Jesus Christ, the end of the first century BC and early first century AD. (Source: Thinkstock Images) The first remains of the earliest lemon, found in the Roman Forum, date to right around the time of Jesus Christ, the end of the first century BC and early first century AD. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Lemons were status symbols for the ancient Roman ruling elite, according to a study which found that they were the first fruits to arrive in the Mediterranean around the time of Jesus. Researchers from Tel Aviv University in Israel studied a collection of ancient texts, art, artifacts and plant remains such as fossil pollen grains, charcoals, seeds.

Until the first century AD, the only citrus produce available to the ancient Romans were the extremely rare and inordinately expensive citrons and lemons, they said. ‚ÄúToday, citrus orchards are a major component of the Mediterranean landscape and one of the most important

cultivated fruits in the region. But citrus is not native to the Mediterranean Basin and originated in Southeast Asia,‚Äù said Dafna Langgut, from Tel Aviv University in Israel.

‚ÄúMy findings show that citrons and lemons were the first citrus fruits to arrive in the Mediterranean and were status symbols for the elite,‚Äù Langgut said. ‚ÄúAll other citrus fruits most probably spread more than a millennium later for economic reasons,‚Äù she added.

At first, Romans only had access to rough-skinned citrons, also known as etrogim ‚Äì mostly rind and dry, tasteless flesh. The citron arrived in Rome from what is now Israel. The earliest botanical remains of the citron were identified in a Persian royal garden near Jerusalem and dated to the 5th-4th centuries BC. It is presumed that it spread from there to other locations around the Mediterranean, researchers said.

‚ÄúThe first remains of the earliest lemon, found in the Roman Forum, date to right around the time of Jesus Christ, the end of the first century BC and early first century AD,‚Äù said Langgut. It appears that the citron was considered a valuable commodity due to its healing qualities, symbolic use, pleasant odour and rarity, researchers said.

Only the rich could have afforded it. Its spread therefore was helped more by its high social status, its significance in religion and its unique features, rather than its culinary qualities, they said. Sour oranges, limes and pomelos were introduced to the West by Muslim traders via Sicily and the Iberian Peninsula much later, in the 10th century AD, Langgut said. ‚ÄúIt is clear that Muslim traders played a crucial role in the dispersal of cultivated citrus in Northern Africa and Southern Europe,‚Äù Langgut said.

Researchers found that the sweet orange associated with Israel today only dates as far back as the 15th century and was the product of a trade route established by the Genoese and, later, the Portuguese. The sticky-sweet mandarin was introduced to the Mediterranean in the beginning of the 19th century, they said. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt until the 15th century that the sweet orange arrived on European tables. By the time mandarins appeared in the 19th century, citrus fruits were considered commonplace.

They were cash crops rather than luxury items,‚Äù said Lanngut. The study was published in the journal HortScience.

2 ex-SAD ministers booked for manhandling cops,"Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh had to come to the gurdwara on August 20 to resolve the dispute. (File) Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh had to come to the gurdwara on August 20 to resolve the dispute. (File)

Two former SAD ministers, Sucha Singh Langah and Seva Singh Sekhwan, were booked by Gurdaspur police on Monday, along with Aam Aadmi Party leader Kanwalpreet Singh Kaki for allegedly manhandling police and preventing them from doing duty. Another 27 people have been booked and 300 unidentified people are also wanted in the case.

Trouble began when Buta Singh, accountant of the historic Gurdwara Ghalughara in Kahnuwan of Gurdaspur, was arrested after being caught in a compromising position with a woman at a gurdwara inn on August 11. But, anger erupted against the gurdwara president and former MLA Johar Singh, who has been president of the gurdwara committee for over 20 years. His accommodation was also inside the gurdwara.

It also gave SAD and Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) an opportunity to challenge the incumbent committee. Johar Singh came closer to the Congress before the Assembly election.

Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh had to come to the gurdwara on August 20 to resolve the dispute. Langah and Sekhwan were also moving towards the gurdwara in a motorcade with the Jathedar and supporters. Police allegedly attempted to stop this motorcade. A large number of SAD workers then overpowered the police and made their way to the gurdwara. Now, a case has been registered against SAD and AAP leaders along with supporters.

The Untold Stories,"Panels with stories shared by Shobha Nehru and Kushwant Singh at the exhibition. (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha) Panels with stories shared by Shobha Nehru and Kushwant Singh at the exhibition. (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)

It was exactly 70 years ago that Shane Ali, an eight-year-old orphan, made his way on foot from Jarahan, Punjab, India, to Kasur, Punjab, Pakistan. He had witnessed the massacre of his entire family during the aftermath of Partition. Now he is settled in the US with his grandchildren.

Till 2010, he had never spoken to anyone about the horrors and tragedies that he had witnessed in 1947. It was only when Guneeta Singh Bhalla, director and founder of The 1947 Partition Archive, approached him that he shared his memories of the historic event that changed the lives of millions in the subcontinent. ‚ÄúMy intention was to gather and share stories about the event before they are lost to posterity,‚Äù says Bhalla.

She has organised a month-long commemorative project in Delhi, which includes ‚ÄúRemembering Partition‚Äù, a three-part exhibition ‚Äî ‚ÄúMemory Through the Ages‚Äù (Bikaner House), ‚ÄúWomen During the Partition‚Äù (India Habitat Centre) and ‚ÄúUnheard Stories‚Äù (India International Center) ‚Äî a film festival on Independence and Partition, and corresponding panel discussions.

An army kid, Bhalla moved to California when she was 10. Growing up, Partition was always something like an elephant in the room that no one talked about. ‚ÄúMy paternal grandmother had made the journey from Lahore with my father, who was an infant then. But no one ever talked about it,‚Äù says Bhalla, adding, ‚ÄúI always felt that there was a huge difference between what was in our textbooks and what really happened back then, but sadly there were no stories or records of oral histories that were available.‚Äù

It all changed with a chance visit to Japan in 2008, where Bhalla visited Hiroshima and the Peace Memorial. ‚ÄúI felt that we had never acknowledged Partition as the rest of the world had acknowledged other tragedies ‚Äî like the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, or how the Holocaust was commemorated with museums, memorials, literature and so on,‚Äù says Bhalla.

Photographs from The 1947 Partition Archive (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha) Photographs from The 1947 Partition Archive (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)

A physicist by profession, Bhalla then started recording stories of people settled in the Bay Area of San Francisco by visiting temples and mosques. She soon started visiting India to record stories of people who had migrated across the subcontinent during Partition. Over a span of seven years, she has built an archive that has more than 4,300 oral stories in 22 languages and 30,000 digital documents and photographs collected from 12 countries.

It is to bring those stories to the mainstream that she thought of this month-long project. ‚ÄúWe have organised panel discussions earlier but we wanted to do something big to mark 70 years of Independent India. We wanted different facets of Partition to be manifested with the three exhibitions.

The show ‚ÄòWomen During the Partition‚Äô that concluded recently brought to light the special role played by women and how they survived this very violent mass displacement. ‚ÄòUnheard Stories‚Äô, which begins on August 26, highlights how Partition affected not just the region of Punjab and Bengal, but also the economy, and impacted even the Northeast,‚Äù informs Bhalla.

The ongoing exhibition ‚ÄúMemory Through the Ages‚Äù, brings together the shared legacies of the two nations through a multimedia exhibition, with stories from The 1947 Partition Archive, and interviews with well-known personalities such as author Khushwant Singh, Olympic athlete Milkha Singh and artist Salima Hashmi, among others. There is also an exhibition titled ‚ÄúKhadi: The Fabric of Freedom‚Äù, curated by Prasad Bidappa. Bhalla, meanwhile, hopes to record at least 10,000 stories. ‚ÄúWe wish to reach as many people as possible,‚Äù she says.

The exhibition ‚ÄúMemory Through the Ages‚Äù is on at Bikaner House till August 24; ‚ÄúUnheard Stories‚Äù will be on display at IIC from August 26 to September 8

Who wouldn‚Äôt want to take a break from all the hustle-bustle of everyday work and go MIA for two days? Even better, imagine leaving all your worries behind and getting to live in a luxury resort, no less. What if we say along with all the plush extravagance you will find at your beck and call in this luxurious stay, you will find just another amenity at this specific luxury stay in Colombia? What amenity? Sex. You heard us!

In what is already creating ripples and controversies across the world, a brothel in Colombia has expanded into an all-inclusive sex resort. Known as the Good Girls Sex Resort, their website goes into great details and calls it the ‚Äúfirst all-inclusive erotic resort in Cali Columbia‚Äù. ‚ÄúGood Girls Colombia is the first all inclusive erotic resort in Cali Colombia. An amazing resort with private villas and the most beautiful Colombian women. A discreet and beautiful environment for men to fulfill their wildest fantasies,‚Äù the website proudly proclaims.

According to the website, other than gorging on delicious food and availing all the other facilities that a luxury stay provides, Good Girls‚Äô Sex Resort also offers to change people‚Äôs ‚Äúfantasies into reality‚Äù. ‚ÄúGood Girls is a resort where you are attended by the most beautiful Latin women, who will be your guardian angels for as long as you decide,‚Äù they claim. But if privacy and security of identity is what is keeping you from considering this, then the resort has that taken care of too.

The resort assures that they prioritise your safety and privacy as long as you stay there and guarantee ‚Äúabsolute discretion‚Äù of the details of your trip at the resort.

The packages that one can avail at the resort ranges from Overnight Package to Gold Package. For $599, a deluxe room, airport transportation, bilingual host and ‚Äú1 Girl Overnight‚Äù are the amenities that you can avail under the Overnight Package and for $1499, you can avail services like ‚Äú2 Girls 24 hours, executive villa, all meals, 1 spa pass‚Äù among others under the Gold Package.

Prostitution is known to be legal in Colombia, under the condition that it is carried out in designated ‚Äútolerance zones‚Äù. Reasons like poverty and displacement due to financial restraints have resulted in prostitution becoming widespread and rampant in the country.

We think it‚Äôs bizarre, but probably at a time when people are in a rush to make flourishing careers leave them with no time to nourish relationships, could this be what many would rather opt for? Let us know what you think in the comments‚Äô section below.

THE PUNJAB Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) has written to all Congress MLAs in the state, reminding them of the one-time financial contribution asked for by the All India Congress Committee and asked them to send a cheque or draft for the same.

A letter, written by Captain Sandeep Sandhu, general secretary of the PPCC office, to all MLAs on August 19, referred to a letter written by AICC treasurer Moti Lal Vohra to PPCC president Sunil Jakhar in this regard. Captain Sandhu‚Äôs missive included Vohra‚Äôs letter along with a format in which details of the payment made have to be submitted.

Steven Mnuchin tells Yale classmates: Donald Trump does not equate neo-Nazis with peaceful protesters,"President Donald Trump answers questions about his responses to the violence, injuries and deaths at the ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù rally in Charlottesville as he talks to the media with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. (Source: Reuters) President Donald Trump answers questions about his responses to the violence, injuries and deaths at the ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù rally in Charlottesville as he talks to the media with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. (Source: Reuters)

Urged by his Yale University classmates to resign as treasury secretary following President Donald Trump‚Äôs response to a white nationalist protest, Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday he would stay in office and that Trump ‚Äúin no way, shape or form‚Äù equates neo-Nazis with peaceful protesters. Mnuchin, along with other members of the cabinet, stood beside the president at a Tuesday news conference as Trump blamed violence in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend on not just white nationalist rally organizers but also counter-protesters, and said there were ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù among both groups.

A letter, dated Aug. 18 and signed by more than 350 members of the Yale class of 1985, argued it was Mnuchin‚Äôs ‚Äúmoral obligation to resign‚Äù immediately because, it said, Trump had ‚Äúdeclared himself a sympathizer with groups whose values are antithetical to those values we consider fundamental to our sacred honor as Americans. ‚ÄúWe know you are better than this, and we are counting on you to do the right thing,‚Äù the letter said.

Mnuchin issued a statement on Saturday responding to his classmates and what he said were many other comments urging him to ‚Äúspeak out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI strongly condemn the actions of those filled with hate and with the intent to harm others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey have no defense from me nor do they have any defense from the president or this administration.‚Äù Mnuchin, who is Jewish, added: ‚ÄúWhile I find it hard to believe I should have to defend myself on this, or the president, I feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way, shape or form, believes that neo-Nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways.‚Äù

Ultimately, he said, his classmates should be comforted by his remaining in the administration. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe the allegations against the president are accurate, and I believe that having highly talented men and women in our country surrounding the president in his administration should be reassuring to you and all the American people,‚Äù he said. In his statement, he also noted the policy priorities he hopes to achieve in office, including tax reform, economic growth, and stopping terrorist financing.

The head of the U.S. military‚Äôs Pacific Command said on Tuesday it was more important to use diplomacy to counter North Korea‚Äôs missile threat rather than consider what actions by the reclusive North might trigger a preemptive strike. Admiral Harry Harris was in South Korea to observe annual joint military drills with the South Korean military, which the North called a step towards nuclear conflict masterminded by the U.S. and South Korean ‚Äúwar maniacs‚Äù. ‚ÄúSo we hope and we work for diplomatic solutions to the challenge presented by Kim Jong Un,‚Äù Harris told reporters at a U.S. air base in South Korea about an hour from the capital, Seoul, referring to the North Korean leader.

He said diplomacy was ‚Äúthe most important starting point‚Äù in response to the North‚Äôs threat, when asked what actions by North Korea might trigger a preemptive U.S. strike against Pyongyang. ‚ÄúAs far as a timeline, it would be crazy for me to share with you those tripwires in advance. If we did that, it would hardly be a military strategy,‚Äù he added. North Korea has pursued missile and nuclear tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and ignored all calls, including from lone major ally China, to stop. It justifies its weapons programmes by pointing to perceived U.S. hostility and regularly threatens to destroy the United States.

The United States and South Korean began long-planned joint military exercises on Monday called the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which the allies have said were purely defensive and did not aim to increase tension on the Korean peninsula. The drills end on Aug. 31 and involve tens of thousands of troops as well as computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea..

A North Korean Army spokesman repeated the threat of undisclosed retaliation against the United States for readying a preemptive strike and a war of aggression, using the drills as an excuse to mount such an attack. ‚ÄúThe U.S. will be wholly held accountable for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by such reckless aggressive war manoeuvres, as it chose a military confrontation,‚Äù the unnamed spokesman said in comments carried by the North‚Äôs official KCNA news agency. Harris also told reporters that a scheduled ‚Äúoperational pause‚Äù by the U.S. Navy‚Äôs fleet worldwide would not affect the military‚Äôs ability to defend South Korea.

The pause was ordered after a U.S. guided missile destroyer collided with an oil tanker in waters near Singapore and Malaysia on Monday.

In his new book, Neel Mukherjee keeps an unwavering focus on the inequities, inequalities and exploitation of human beings by human beings

Title: A State of Freedom

Author: Neel Mukherjee

Publisher: Penguin Random House

Pages: 278

Price: Rs 599

If Neel Mukherjee‚Äôs Booker-shortlisted The Lives of Others (2014) was a diachronic dissection of the Ghosh family, spanning lifetimes, in his latest offering, A State of Freedom, he uses his linguistic scalpel for a synchronic cutting open of India‚Äôs now and here. Less a novel than a set of five linked narratives, their lengths ranging from a brief eight pages to a novella-length 100, A State of Freedom is probably the most sustained reflection on class in post-Liberalisation India in contemporary fiction. Reminiscent of two monumental works of non-fiction, P Sainath‚Äôs path-breaking Everybody Loves a Good Drought, published over two decades ago, and Sudeep Chakravarti‚Äôs Red Sun: Travels in Naxalite Country, published in 2008, Mukherjee‚Äôs novel brings back to the discussion table issues that seem to have fallen out of favour with the chatterati and the intelligentsia these last few years.

From the opening narrative‚Äôs unnamed protagonist, the Kolkata-born and‚Äìbred ‚Äútourist in his own country‚Äù, whose two decades in ‚Äúthe academic communities of the East Coast of the USA [have] defanged him of the easy Indian ability to bark at people considered as servants‚Äù, to the second narrative‚Äôs first-person narrator, a London-based designer, also Kolkata-born, who too is appalled at the way in which supposedly educated people like his own parents treat domestic workers in India, to the ‚Äúservants‚Äù themselves, who are the subjects of the three remaining narratives, Mukherjee keeps an unwavering focus on the inequities, inequalities and exploitation of human being by human being in every story.

Yet, as the protagonists of his stories seem to believe, and Mukherjee himself seems to at times, not all human beings are equal, or, more problematically, capable of being equal. In the second narrative, the first-person narrator parenthetically describes his own use of the term ‚Äúdomestic help‚Äù thus: ‚Äú(My mother‚Äôs generation still called them servants. My politically correct tag [i.e. domestic help] had not a jot of correlation to their status: their position in the Indian social hierarchy or economy had never changed)‚Äù. But this ironic self-deprecatory statement is marred by the statement, a few lines earlier, of the creation of the state of Jharkhand ‚Äúcarved out‚Ä¶ after decades of agitation and activism by tribal peoples and backward castes ‚Äî they had that dreaded Indian distinction, the branding iron of an acronym: OBC, Other Backward Castes ‚Äî for a separate state‚Ä¶‚Äù etc. One notes several things here. First, the bleeding-heart-liberal championing of the underdog (tribals and backward castes); second, the use of the adjective ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù (see all the quotes above ‚Äî Indian ability, Indian social hierarchy, dreaded Indian distinction); and, finally, the egregious error about the expanded form of ‚ÄúOBC‚Äù, which stands for ‚ÄúOther Backward Classes‚Äù and not ‚ÄúOther Backward Castes‚Äù. Is this the narrator‚Äôs error or Mukherjee‚Äôs? And is the repeated use of the adjective ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù to indicate primitive, casteist, sexist, class-biased positions a reflection of the narrators‚Äô views or Mukherjee‚Äôs own? Not an easy question to answer.

A central takeaway from this beautifully written novel is that if one is born in middle-class, relatively privileged, urban India (a member of the English-medium class) one can only imbibe democratic and human values, and develop the ability to look critically at oneself, if one lives in the West; remaining in India dooms one to continue one‚Äôs horrifically solipsistic middle-class existence, treating everyone who is one‚Äôs social inferior with contempt and brutality. Such, for example, are the people who are Milly‚Äôs employers ‚Äî the domestic help/servant who moves from the underdeveloped Naxal-infested jungles of Jharkhand to the highrises of Bombay/Mumbai (where she works for the parents of the second story‚Äôs narrator, among others) ‚Äî one of whom, in Kolkata, is described as having picked up and thrown a 10-year-old boy ‚Äúdown the hole through which the lift goes up and down‚Äù. Milly, central figure in the novella-length narrative, is told she ‚Äúshould be grateful for what you have ‚Äî things are far worse out there‚Äù by the tribal Christian woman who had got her a job as a domestic worker.

Mukherjee‚Äôs novel strikes all the right guilt-ridden-anti-capitalist-liberal-pinko-lefty chords so beloved of the West‚Äôs educated classes: middle-class Indians (who are actually pretty near the top of the class hierarchy, and so, should be seen as rich) are brutal exploiters of innocent tribals; innocent tribals who convert to Christianity end up exploiting their own people; development has only added modern forms of misery and enslavement to India‚Äôs traditional heritage of discrimination and violence; the only way out of this seems to be death, whether willed or otherwise. No wonder it has won high praise from Western critics. But for this reviewer, the biases that Mukherjee seeks to lay bare with his cutting prose end up revealing some of his own ‚Äî and these are not always very pretty.

A magnificently written, marvellously phrased book, with its heart in its right place, A State of Freedom might not be quite what its Western critics claim (‚Äúdevastating portrait of the inhumanity of the rich to the poor‚Äù, and so on) but it is certainly worth the read, if only to discover what it stumbles in attempting as also what it succeeds in achieving.

America‚Äôs 16 years in Afghanistan: From triumph to stalemate,"U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer. (Source: Reuters) U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer. (Source: Reuters)

Sixteen years of U.S. warfare in Afghanistan have left the insurgents as strong as ever and the nation‚Äôs future precarious. Facing a quagmire, President Donald Trump on Monday outlined his strategy for ‚Äúvictory‚Äù in a country that has historically snared great powers and defied easy solutions. Sixteen years of U.S. warfare in Afghanistan have left the insurgents as strong as ever and the nation‚Äôs future precarious.

Facing a quagmire, President Donald Trump on Monday outlined his strategy for ‚Äúvictory‚Äù in a country that has historically snared great powers and defied easy solutions. America‚Äôs longest-running war began well as U.S.-led forces quickly toppled the Taliban government and disrupted al-Qaida leaders who plotted the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks from Afghan soil. But the fighting never ended.

In recent years, security has gradually worsened as Taliban insurgents, enjoying sanctuary in Pakistan, have gained a foothold across the country. Afghanistan‚Äôs rampant heroin trade, official corruption and infighting among the nation‚Äôs elite have only compounded problems. Trump is the third U.S. president to grapple with the Afghan challenge. A look at the phases of the U.S. involvement to date:

REGIME CHANGE

Less than a month after the 9/11 attacks, a massive U.S. air campaign targets al-Qaida fighters and Taliban troops, training camps and air defenses. Anti-Taliban forces of the Northern Alliance enter Kabul as the Taliban flee. By December 2001, Afghan groups agree on a deal in Bonn, Germany, for an interim government. With Afghanistan liberated from Taliban control, the U.S. military force grows to 2,500 as troops scour the mountainous Tora Bora region looking for al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. He eludes capture. Although President George W. Bush remains leery of supporting nation-building efforts in Afghanistan, the U.S. expands its counter terrorism operations. By the end of 2002, there are 9,700 U.S. troops in the country.

DEMOCRACY AND DISTRACTION

In November 2004, Hamid Karzai, who had served two years as interim leader, is the clear winner in Afghanistan‚Äôs first direct election for president. The Bush administration hails the vote as a key step in the nation‚Äôs transformation. Millions of girls return to school after being barred under the Taliban. As the country opens up, Western aid helps the economy grow, at least in urban areas. But the Taliban, enjoying sanctuary in Pakistan, show signs of re-emergence, launching sporadic attacks on government forces in eastern Afghanistan. Although Karzai is an ethnic Pashtun, which comprise the bulk of Taliban recruits, his government alienates what is Afghanistan‚Äôs main ethnic group. Karzai‚Äôs administration is dominated by former commanders of the Northern Alliance.

U.S. troop numbers swell to 20,000, but Washington‚Äôs attention increasingly turns to Iraq. The U.S. invades in March 2003, toppling Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It struggles with the aftermath. Soon Iraq is gripped by an explosion of sectarian violence that preoccupies Bush until he leaves office.

MORE WESTERN TROOPS, MORE VIOLENCE

In 2006, NATO assumes responsibility for security across the whole of Afghanistan, pumping troops into Taliban heartlands in the south of the country. The U.S. ups its forces in the country to 30,000. Britain, Canada and others boost their contributions. But the violence and lawlessness worsens. Production of opium, the raw material of heroin, soars to a record high, funding the insurgency and fueling official corruption. Tensions grow between Afghanistan and Pakistan over cross-border Taliban attacks. In the fall of 2008, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Adm. Mike Mullen concedes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôre winning.‚Äù

SURGE

President Barack Obama, vowing to refocus U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, enters office in 2009 endorsing shifts to a counterinsurgency strategy designed to protect Afghan civilians rather than hunt down Taliban. He quickly sends in 21,000 more forces. After a prolonged policy review, Obama orders an additional surge, bringing troop levels to a high of 100,000 by August 2010. He says the U.S. will begin withdrawing forces by 2011. Critics say the drawdown date diminishes the incentive for the Taliban to negotiate for peace. Bin Laden is killed in a U.S. special operations raid in Pakistan in March 2011. Obama then presses ahead with plans to hand over security responsibilities to Afghanistan by 2014. By the end of that year, NATO ends its combat mission in the country. U.S. relations with Karzai, however, deteriorate. A contested election to replace Karzai introduces a more pro-U.S. leader in Ashraf Ghani, but his government is bitterly divided.

NO WITHDRAWAL

With violence reaching post-2001 highs and Afghan security forces taking heavy casualties, Obama backtracks on plans to virtually withdraw all U.S. forces by the end of 2016. He leaves office with 8,400 troops still in the country. The U.S. kills new Taliban leader Mullah Mansour in a drone attack in Pakistan in May 2016, derailing peace talks. But on the battlefield, the Taliban are in the ascendant and threaten provincial capitals in both the north and south. The Islamic State group gains a foothold in eastern Afghanistan.

ENTER TRUMP

Trump says little about Afghanistan during his first seven months in office, while the military grows antsy. The Pentagon proposes sending in nearly 4,000 more U.S. troops to increase training of Afghan forces and counter terrorism operations, but the administration is divided on strategy. Nearly everyone considers the fight a stalemate, and some in Trump‚Äôs administration even propose withdrawing or handing over the entire American effort to private security contractors. Among Afghans, anti-Western sentiment grows over deteriorating security, even in the capital, Kabul. The economy also suffers, partly as a result of a draw down in foreign forces. As Trump is poised to announce his plan, Afghanistan‚Äôs government controls only about half of the country. After months of debate, Trump finally unveils his strategy in a prime-time television address. He says the U.S. will win ‚Äúin the end,‚Äù defeating al-Qaida and IS fighters, and ensuring the government doesn‚Äôt fall to the Taliban. He refuses to provide troop increase numbers or timelines, saying military assistance would be determined by results and the cooperation of Afghanistan‚Äôs beleaguered government.

Chintan hired ‚Äòcontract killers‚Äô: Cops,"Chintan Upadhyay Chintan Upadhyay

THE MUMBAI police have opposed the discharge plea filed by artist Chintan Upadhyay in the Kandivali double murders claiming it was a case of ‚Äúcontract killing‚Äù to get relief from his matrimonial problems. The police claimed that the accused, apart from Upadhyay, had ‚Äúno motive‚Äù to murder his wife Hema and her lawyer Harish Bhambhani. ‚ÄúThe applicant (Upadhyay) wanted relief from problems with his wife Hema Upadhyay by killing her, and the other accused were to get monetary benefits,‚Äù the reply filed by the police on Monday states.

The police also said that there was evidence in terms of the diaries recovered from Upadhyay‚Äôs Delhi home where he had expressed his ‚Äútrauma, and grievance‚Äù against his wife, her brothers, relatives and her advocate. ‚ÄúHe specifically expressed in the diary that his life has been made miserable by all these persons,‚Äù the reply states. It also says that an FIR was registered by Hema for alleged obscenity against Upadhyay where she claimed that he drew objectionable and obscene images on the walls of their house to humiliate her‚Ä¶‚Äùthe servant had started looking at her in an objectionable manner because of the said images. The grievance of the applicant was that instead of dismissing the servant, she had lodged a report against him, for which he had to obtain a bail,‚Äù the reply said.

The police also relied on the ‚Äúconduct‚Äù of Upadhyay before and after the incident. They claimed that servants of the couple in their Juhu home had said that on his last visit to the Juhu home before the incident, Upadhyay had ‚Äúdeliberately bid goodbye to Hema three times‚Äù.

While the police claimed that a picture seen by Bhambhani‚Äôs wife Poonam sent by Upadhyay on Hema‚Äôs phone said, ‚ÄúI will destroy you‚Äù, they have now said that the mobile phone has not been found. The police claim that though co-accused Pradeep Rajbhar has retracted from his confessional statement, it can be relied upon as evidence against Upadhyay. It says that other statements including that of Bhambhani‚Äôs family members show that there was a matrimonial dispute between Hema and Upadhyay and that ‚Äúhe wanted to destroy her‚Äù.

The bodies of Hema and Bhambhani were found in December 2015 in a nullah in Kandivali. The police claim that absconding accused Vijay Rajbhar had lured the victims into meeting him by claiming that he had information on Upadhyay which Hema could use in her matrimonial dispute against him.

Dalits vs Dalits: Youth killed for ‚Äòhelping‚Äô couple elope,"Parents of Kanu Parmar, who has eloped. (Express photo) Parents of Kanu Parmar, who has eloped. (Express photo)

Days after Kiran Parmar, a 21-year-old orphan from Dalvana in Gujarat‚Äôs Banaskantha district was killed ‚Äî allegedly beaten to death for ‚Äúfacilitating‚Äù eloping of a couple from neighbouring Varvadiya ‚Äî decades-old affinity between people of the two villages are at a breaking point.

Kiran, who worked as a waiter in a Surat hotel and had come home to take part in a fair, was a Dalit ‚Äî as are the couple who have eloped, and many of those arrested for his murder on August 15.

Banaskantha police say this is one of the trickiest case registered under the Atrocities Act in the district in recent times.

‚ÄúWe made immediate arrests and are now looking for the 17-year old girl (name withheld) and Kanu Parmar, who have eloped,‚Äù Banaskantha‚Äôs Superintendent of Police (SP) Neeraj Badgujar said.

Deputy SP of Palanpur (SC/ST cell) Hetal Patel, who is leading the probe, said the elopement caused a rift in Dalit communities of the villages ‚Äî many of the residents are related by marriage ‚Äî and the murder ‚Äúhas made matters worse‚Äù.

‚ÄúKiran died when he was beaten ‚Äî brutally ‚Äî for the second time by men from his own community from Varvadia village,‚Äù Patel added.

Those arrested are Ramesh Parmar, Talshi Parmar, Babu Parmar, Ishwar Parmar, Ashok Parmar, Ramesh Parmar, Vira Parmar and Ramesh Dharma Parmar ‚Äî all from Varvadiya village, where the eloped couple come from ‚Äî besides Nayan Rabari and his accomplices Vijay Padhiyar from Vadodara and Vishnu Rabari, Mukesh Rabari, Umang Rabari and Vishwas Rabari, all residents of Ahmedabad

‚ÄúKiran, 21, and Kanu, 19 (who eloped with the girl), grew up together and were friends. Kiran had come down from Surat for satam mela (a popular fair). He went to the fair with Kanu and the girl, and someone saw them together there,‚Äù said Jetha Parmar, a retired police inspector and Kiran‚Äôs uncle.

That report that went out, it appears, as Kiran left for Surat after the fair ‚Äúbut the girl and Kanu did not return home‚Äù, Jetha Parmar said.

Kiran was heading for Surat in a bus, when Parmars from the girl‚Äôs village learnt that he was the last person who was with the couple, and imagined he ‚Äúfacilitated‚Äù their elopement. They gave the bus a chase, but unable to stop it, the girl‚Äôs father rung up his employer, Amumiyan Lohani, a Vadodara-based businessman, the police said. ‚ÄúLohani called some friends for help, and his Facebook friend Nayan Rabari responded,‚Äù DySP Hetal Patel said.

According to police, Lohani told Rabari about Kiran and sent his picture on WhatsApp, asking him to stop the bus and intercept the young man.

Rabari, who was under the impression that the girl was from his own community, intercepted, beat Kiran brutally to ‚Äúteach him a lesson‚Äù and subsequently handed him over to the Parmars of Varvadia, who got him to Vadodara in a car, SP Badgujar said. Kiran Parmar died on the way ‚Äî the postmortem records cerebral haemorrhage as the cause of death.

Kanu and the girl both belong to Varvadi village ‚Äî neighbours and distantly related, Jetha said. ‚ÄúVarvadi and our village, Dalvana, have a history of friendship ‚Äî we, Parmars, from each village have married our daughters to boys from the other. But this incident will change everything,‚Äù he said.

Kiran‚Äôs younger sister Asha Parmar told The Sunday Express, ‚ÄúMy brother is dead, and we will not get him back. All I hope now is Kanubhai and the girl are not killed once they are found.‚Äù

At Dalvana, 5 km from Varvadia, the girl‚Äôs mother, Geeta, said, ‚ÄúI do not want to see my daughter again. She has humiliated us‚Ä¶ she is dead for me. She grew up with Kanu, my cousin‚Äôs son. How could they run away, and in the process an innocent Kiran was killed.‚Äù

Kanu‚Äôs parents, Vasa and Ratna Parmar, have left home after their son eloped and are staying in a cowshed on the outskirts of the village at present. ‚ÄúWe cannot face our community after what our son has done. Our elder son Ramesh is in jail, as he also joined the men in finding Kiran,‚Äù Vasa Parmar said.

Pro Kabaddi: How fit are Indian players from their overseas counterparts?,"Pro Kabaddi has been modified and will be played across three months. Pro Kabaddi has been modified and will be played across three months.

Fitness in today‚Äôs sporting world goes hand in hand if one aspires to achieve desired goals. We have seen Indian cricket team‚Äôs captain Virat Kohli‚Äôs work out regime which has taken his game to a different level. However, in recent times, foreign coaches have often complained about the physical and psychological fitness of Indian players. Football coach Stephen Constantine recently wrote in his autobiography that when he joined the Indian football team, he was shell-shocked to see their approach and poor performance.

While the format of the fifth season of Pro Kabaddi has been modified and will be played across three months. During a brief interaction with Indianexpress.com, Gujarat Fortunegiants‚Äô physiotherapists Sameep Sanjiv Shah and coach Manpreet Singh revealed the current scenario of fitness among the Indian players and what separates them from the overseas players.

Coach Manpreet Singh

Every game has its own diet. You can‚Äôt get wrestling‚Äôs diet into kabaddi and one can‚Äôt expect kabaddi player follow cricketers diet. Every game requires a different diet structure, different body fitness. Kabaddi is a mixture of three games ‚Äì wrestling, judo and athletics ‚Äì and in this you have to have endurance. Brick muscles are important, the body must be flexible like that of gymnasts. We simply can‚Äôt put a kabaddi player on juices, or only on proteins. You need to give the right amount of proteins, carbs (carbohydrates), supplements. And this is when the role of coaches, physio, trainer to look after his diet.

Earlier, we didn‚Äôt have facilities in Kabaddi. We played in mud, and there was no trainer, physio, and coach used to do all the jobs. But, today we have every facility and technology possible. Now, a player is being guided and worked upon his prior injuries is done. Joints are more prone to injuries in a sport like kabaddi. When we organise a camp before the season, a lot of work is done on players fitness. Trainers put a lot of efforts to increase player‚Äôs power, where as physio makes sure that muscles are not tight ahead of the match to avoid any injury.

We had a 25-day preparatory camp in SAI Gandhinagar where in the first week we assessed them through medical tests. In the second week, we sat together and made charts for every player. In the remaining two weeks, we worked upon their previous injuries, increasing their endurance, stamina. Even the Iranian players joined us for the camp.

Physiotherapists Sameep Sanjiv Shah

As a Physiotherapist, I believe our hands are enough but when you are playing tournaments like IPL, ISL, I-League, and PKL, the body is prone to injuries. Thus the market has introduced so many types of equipment like for muscle recovery. We have game reading, recovery boots (used in football as well). All these machines help us reduce the recovery period of a player.

Physio‚Äôs role is to diagnose the injury. Once the basic diagnosis is done, we do a clinical assessment if it is a joint injury. And in joint injury, surrounding structures will be involved too. After analysing the actual reason behind the injury we use joint mobilisation like mfr (medical first responder)is used.

On pre-season

Pre-season is all about basic assessments. Trainer, coaches sit together and discuss the strengths, endurance of each player. After getting their basic assessments, we particularly work to turn their weaknesses into their strengths.

Foreign players are introduced to pre-season, diet, fitness at a very early stage whereas in Indian players are introduced to all this very late. We see footballers going through medical tests and play pre-season tournaments so that their bodies are ready for long tiring seasons. The concept of having a pre-season or preparatory camps has begun here.

Physio‚Äôs job on rest days

Our focus is on to have the player fit for the next match. There are plenty of electrical modalities being used to promote healing of body parts. In order to provide relief from swelling or pain, IFC, Neuromuscular stimulation, ultrasound, recovery boots, ice baths and many more techniques are being used.

Generally on a match day, stretching and pool sessions are conducted. But on rest days, we go for modalities like recovery boots or ice baths. We emphasise on improving the blood circulation. Manually a player needs around 48 hours but with recovery boots, which works on ‚Äòpure air compression‚Äô concept, it decreases the time to 24 hours.

Wherein ice bath or GRM work on micro injuries, muscle tears. Such methods are used right after the matches. In addition, we have foam loading, stretching, swimming pool recovery and wax recovery baths. I personally feel that we should rather work on prevention than curing them.

Also, sleep plays a major role in recovery. A player ideally should get a sleep of 7-8 hours. Certain hormones are released while sleeping thus minimising the recovery span.

"Utkal Express derailment: Railways‚Äô problem with trackmen, too qualified for manual labour","The scene from the derailment in Muzaffarnagar The scene from the derailment in Muzaffarnagar

At the heart of Railways‚Äô track maintenance challenge is an unusual problem with its trackmen: overqualification.

The job of manual labour involves patrolling tracks day and night in all weather conditions while looking for faults in the tracks and rectifying them with tools.

But the job has attracted more and more educated youths over the years. Officers claim that the new, educated lot does not want to really to do the job as faithfully as its predecessors. Of the almost 2.2 lakh trackmen in India, the number of those with graduate and postgraduate degrees and diplomas has increased manifold, the Railways said. ‚ÄúThere are also MBAs,‚Äù said a Railway Board officer. ‚ÄúThey just want a railway job. They don‚Äôt want the work. They are more suited for office work, they claim,‚Äù he said.

That supervising them in the rigours of a trackman is a tough challenge was indicated in an audio-clip purportedly of a conversation between an older gangman and a Railway official after the derailment. ‚ÄúNowadays, the boys don‚Äôt want to do this job. They say, ‚Äògive us jobs like sitting at a level crossing gate‚Äô and the like. No one was listening to the Junior Engineer,‚Äù he is heard saying.

So, the Group D job selection process, which involves a written exam as an entry point, throws up a lot of people who would rather do something else than patrol an 8-km railway section on foot all day, carrying a heavy tool bag. That is something railway officers come to know only after they are inducted.

‚ÄúSoon after these boys join, we keep getting frequent requests from them for transfers to other Group D jobs like working in the coaching depot or as bungalow peons in officers‚Äô houses. Some claim they know computers and have certificates to show,‚Äù said a Northern Railway officer, who did not want to be named.

The minimum qualification in the earlier days for the post was education till Class VIII, which was later increased to Class X. Two months ago, the minimum qualification was made Industrial Training Institute certification. However, the ones who appear for the exam are often Commerce and Science graduates and postgraduates. Two years ago, for 4,000 vacancies of trackmen, the applications received were 10 times more.

Efforts to replace this age-old profile, a legacy of the British-era railways, results in backlash from unions, even though nowadays there are rails without too many fishplates that require lesser continuous manual inspection. The Railways‚Äô way of introducing mechanised processes of track health assessment has always been slow because of this.

David Wagner surprised by on song Huddersfield Town‚Äôs start,"Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner exudes positivity but not even the upbeat German expected the Yorkshire club to win their first two games in the Premier League. The Terriers have a 100 percent record in their first season in the top flight in 45 years after they followed up last week‚Äôs 3-0 triumph at Crystal Palace with a 1-0 win over Newcastle United on Sunday.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to pinch myself but I didn‚Äôt expect it,‚Äù Wagner said after the club‚Äôs opening home game. ‚ÄúIf anyone knows that in football anything is possible it is me and our club after what we saw last season and what we felt.

‚ÄúBut we only wanted to be brave in every single game, only wanted to search for our chance and I think we have done it so far. We are over the moon with six points from the two opening games and two clean sheets.‚Äù

Roared on by a 24,128 crowd, Huddersfield attacked from the outset and then defended with determination after they went ahead through Aaron Mooy‚Äôs excellent strike.

‚ÄúI think these points were deserved that is what makes it even bigger for me. We had to invest everything from the first second to the last to get these points on board,‚Äù said Wagner, whose team won promotion via the Championship playoffs.

‚ÄúWe are Huddersfield Town, nobody should forget this. We got promoted at Wembley but we have started the season with two wins and six points. This is unbelievable. Everybody has invested so much and I am happy for them,‚Äù added the German.

Midfielder Tom Ince, son of former Manchester United and England international Paul and one of nine new signings at Huddersfield, said Wagner has told the team that reaching the Premier League is not enough.

‚ÄúThe manager has come and said it, we are not here just to be part of the league we are here to show people what we are about and that we deserve to be in the Premier League,‚Äù Ince said. ‚ÄúToday was about winning. Two games, six points and we move on.‚Äù

There were no signs of stage-fright from Huddersfield on Sunday despite the high levels of anticipation from the home crowd.

‚ÄúI told them (the players) ‚Äòenjoy it ‚Äì you delivered so that this atmosphere will happen‚Äô,‚Äù said Wagner.

Myanmar men appeal against death sentences over British murders in Thailand,"Capital punishment has not been carried out in Thailand for many years. (Representational image) Capital punishment has not been carried out in Thailand for many years. (Representational image)

Two men from Myanmar convicted of killing two British backpackers on a Thai holiday island in 2014 submitted their final appeal on Monday against the death sentence. The murder of tourists Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, sent shockwaves around Thailand and the world, because of the nature of their deaths and the fact the killings took place on an island popular with tourists.

Some migrant rights groups accused Thai police of bungling the investigation and failing to properly seal off the crime scene. Police have defended the probe and the families of both victims have spoken out in defence of the police investigation.

Witheridge was raped and murdered and Miller was beaten and killed. Their bodies were found on a beach on the southern island of Koh Tao in the Gulf of Thailand.

Myanmar migrant workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun lost an appeal in March to have their sentence overturned after they were convicted by a court on Koh Samui island in December 2015. ‚ÄúThe deadline is today so we have to submit it. This is the final chance to appeal,‚Äù Nakhon Chomphuchat, head of the pair‚Äôs defence team, told Reuters.

The 2015 conviction was mired in controversy with supporters of the two migrant workers arguing that they had been framed and that they had initially confessed to the crimes under duress. During the trial, police investigators handling the case were accused by the defence of failing to properly collect and test DNA samples from the scene of the crime. Prosecutors argued that evidence against the pair was rock solid. Capital punishment has not been carried out in Thailand for many years.

Would you like to be matched at work?,"Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

‚ÄúI want to do fraandship with you‚Ä¶‚Äù is something every woman has heard, being randomly accosted on the road, and yes, that has now translated online, to not just Facebook and other social networking sites, but also the professional LinkedIn. While I‚Äôm usually careful about avoiding ‚Äúfriendship requests‚Äù from people I don‚Äôt know on Facebook, I‚Äôm not that reticent on LinkedIn, since it‚Äôs a site where professionals pursue career goals. But, I‚Äôve had to un-connect after receiving ‚Äúfriendship requests‚Äù in my mailbox marked to ‚ÄúMy dear‚Ä¶‚Äù.

So, when a new matrimonial app decides to pitch itself as the perfect playing ground for dating with a purpose, using the professional networking site as its database, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that it would weed out the Romeos. Promatch, playing cupid to ambitious careerists, claims to be a notch above the typical dating apps, which are used for ‚Äúflirting‚Äù and ‚Äúcasual relationships‚Äù, among other things. Promatch, on the other hand, since it has LinkedIn verified profiles, effectively points you towards mates who are (hopefully!) ‚Äúfocused towards a serious relationship‚Äù and get this‚Äîyou can search in same industry, match your incomes and city.

First off, hookups happen everywhere, whether it‚Äôs at work or elsewhere. It‚Äôs the same people, after all, whether you meet at a bar, through common friends or at work, with or without an app. Potential partners can‚Äôt grow a sincerity gene, just because you happen to be a ‚Äòpro‚Äô match. But, what‚Äôs commendable is the clear-headed approach it takes to matrimony, something Indians are famous for. While it‚Äôs fine to kiss all the frogs you like, make your ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù before you find your Prince Charming or the woman of your dreams, when it comes to marriage, there‚Äôs a very decided checklist, which puts the earning capacity of a spouse right on top. And, conventionally, parents have looked for a doctor for their doctor son or daughter and other similar matches. And, while such an app may sound like fun, it‚Äôs not really, since it‚Äôs similar to the ‚Äúbio-data‚Äù that gets sent around to relatives and all those who reach out, listing educational qualifications, even parents‚Äô and relatives‚Äô career progression, if someone is well-placed in a government job, etc. It‚Äôs all laid out, bare bones, without any pretensions. In this generation, where we act all this doesn‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre one better than our parents, such an app calls out our innate‚Ä¶well, ‚ÄúIndian-ness‚Äù. Will the guy understand my hours? Can he support me if I take a break after a baby? Will the woman be able to equally pitch in for my dream home EMIs? Well, let‚Äôs face it, we‚Äôre like that only. Or a lot of us still are.

Matching incomes is not a bad thing, ideally. I remember, when a friend‚Äôs marriage was breaking up, one of the things was that rankled was their approach to money. While she was middle-class in her thinking, putting off the lights and fans whenever she left a room or haggled with auto-wallahs, the guy was beyond such cares. On a daily basis, such things can blow up into something huge. So yes, coming from a similar income bracket isn‚Äôt such a bad idea. Same industry? What about all the gossip that follows if you break up? And, what about all your dark secrets that can be laid bare through common contacts? In other words, just like when you apply for a job, it‚Äôs easy to do a background check! So, it‚Äôs time to hold back on the drinks at office parties‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt want that making it to your profile!

But, while a friend I checked with, said she didn‚Äôt mind giving it a try, some others question the concept of getting matched with a ‚Äúpro‚Äù. ‚ÄúI would much rather go with the flow,‚Äù one guy said, adding ‚ÄúWhat my partner does is not really the question. It‚Äôs the person that‚Äôs important.‚Äù Another, in his early twenties, who loves video games was thrilled with the idea of maybe finding someone from the gaming industry, so they could literally play together. However, he added sagely, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs for people who care about the ‚Äòstatus‚Äô of their spouse‚Ä¶who feel the need to show off, perhaps.‚Äù

Well, how about doing it the old-fashioned way? Whether you swipe right or left on Tinder if you find someone hot (or not), or check out their incomes, don‚Äôt lose focus on the real thing‚Äîfinding a partner who understands you, not just your cranky boss and working hours, though that can be a good start. So, go ahead, log on! Finding the right someone never sounded as easy‚Ä¶.or tough! Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it.

Twinkle Khanna, known to not mince her words, remains unapologetic about posting a picture of a man openly defecating in Mumbai. Well, her post may have been a sarcastic take on her husband Akshay Kumar‚Äôs latest outing Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, but a number of Twinkle‚Äôs followers were unhappy as they felt that she was making fun of a genuine problem.

Trump weighing options for new South Asia strategy: White House,"President Donald Trump (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)

Donald Trump is weighing his options on formulating a new US strategy in South Asia with the focus on Afghanistan, the White House has said, after the President held a key meeting with his national security team. Trump would take a final decision on this at an appropriate time, the White House said, without divulging the details of the meeting during which Trump was briefed by his national security team.

‚ÄúImportant day spent at Camp David with our very talented Generals and military leaders. Many decisions made, including on Afghanistan,‚Äù Trump tweeted after the meeting at the presidential retreat at Camp David, a picturesque resort in Maryland. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the President was briefed extensively by his national security team on a new strategy to protect America‚Äôs interests in South Asia.

‚ÄúThe President is studying and considering his options and will make an announcement to the American people, to our allies and partners, and to the world at the appropriate time,‚Äù Sanders said in a statement after

Besides the National Security Adviser Lt Gen H R McMaster, the meeting was attended by Vice President Mike Pence, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Director of national Intelligence Daniel Coats, and President‚Äôs top Adviser on South Asia Lisa Curtis.

Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and US Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, attended the meeting through a secured video conference. The administration has said its Afghanistan strategy will be determined by a review of its approach to the broader region, including Pakistan and India. Meanwhile, Senator Lindsay Graham, in a statement, urged the US President not to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.

‚ÄúIf we were to pull all our troops from Afghanistan it would be a disaster for our national security interests and set the stage for another 9/11 on American soil,‚Äù Graham said. Graham hoped that Trump, unlike his predecessor, will not put US military in a bad spot in Afghanistan.

‚ÄúHe should give them the tools and support they need to confront the rising terror threats in Afghanistan. Today, our diplomatic efforts are non-existent in Afghanistan and the same is true in neighbouring Pakistan,‚Äù Graham said.

Pest control professionals have key role in public health: United Phosphorus Limited Chairman R D Shroff,"Delegates attend the three-day conference. Express Delegates attend the three-day conference. Express

The pest control industry in the country has a role to play in areas of civic health management and protecting foodgrain from rodents, industrialist and United Phosphorus Limited Chairman R D Shroff said on Saturday. Pest control professionals must participate in government efforts to control diseases spread by pests and also educate people on the importance of pest control, Shroff said.

Shroff was speaking as the chief guest at IndiaPest 2017, the 50th annual golden jubilee conference of the Indian Pest Control Association in the city. The three-day conference has drawn pest control professionals from across the country. Shroff said India, being a populous country, was vulnerable to diseases spread by pests and controlling the menace can greatly help in maintaining public health. India is the largest producer of foodgrain in the world and yet loses a huge part of it to rodents, Shroff said, adding that the country could use effective pest control to deal with this contradiction.

The conference is scheduled to see discussions on topics such as Fumigation Practices & Way Forward, Ant & Fly Management in Commercial Facilities, Food Safety and Role of Pest Management Professionals in India, Pest Management in Commercial Establishments and others. There is also an exhibition of products and equipment on pest control. IPCA conferred a lifetime achievement to PCI Pest Control Pvt Ltd for their contribution to the industry and IPCA, which was received by the company‚Äôs Director Jushua Rao in the absence of Chairman Anil Rao. IPCA also felicitated its past president and first treasurer of the association, Deepak Shah. Raju Parulkar, president of IPCA, welcomed the delegates. Gopi Nair, organising committee member, proposed the vote of thanks.

China on Tuesday jumped to the defence of its all-weather ally Pakistan in the wake of US President Donald Trump‚Äôs stern warning to it over providing safe havens to terrorists, saying that Islamabad is at the frontline of combating terrorism. Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to announce his Afghanistan and South Asia policy, hit out at Pakistan for providing safe havens to ‚Äúagents of chaos‚Äù that kill Americans in Afghanistan and warned Islamabad that it has ‚Äúmuch to lose‚Äù by harbouring terrorists.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, while reacting to Trump‚Äôs comments on Pakistan, said, ‚ÄúHope the relevant policy decision by US side will be conducive to promoting security, stability of the relevant region.‚Äù

‚Äú(On) President Trump‚Äôs remarks on Pakistan, I should say that Pakistan is at the frontline of fighting terrorism, has made sacrifices in fighting terrorism, making an important contribution to upholding peace and stability,‚Äù Hua said, strongly defending Beijing‚Äôs all-weather friend.

Trump, in his address, said a pillar of his new strategy was a change in America‚Äôs approach to Pakistan.

He slammed Pakistan for its support to terror groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so.

‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,‚Äù Trump said.

‚ÄúPakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists,‚Äù he said, in a warning to Pakistan.

Hua, in response to Trump‚Äôs scathing criticism of Pakistan‚Äôs support to terror groups, said, ‚ÄúI think the international community should truly affirm‚Äù the efforts by Pakistan in combating terrorism.

‚ÄúWe are pleased to see US and Pakistan to conduct cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts on the basis of mutual respect and contribute to the global peace and stability,‚Äù she said.

In his speech, Trump slammed Islamabad for harbouring militants who target US service members.

‚ÄúBut that will have to change. That will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country‚Äôs harbouring of militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace,‚Äù Trump said

Trading Restriction on 331 ‚Äòshell firms‚Äô: Sebi stick falls evenly on erring and better-run,"The Sebi list, on the other hand, also has many companies that either show no revenue or high revenues and no profits for a series of 3 years or more. Illustration: C R Sasikumar The Sebi list, on the other hand, also has many companies that either show no revenue or high revenues and no profits for a series of 3 years or more. Illustration: C R Sasikumar

Days after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on August 7 asked stock exchanges to restrict trading in shares of 331 listed companies that were allegedly operating as ‚Äúshell companies‚Äù, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has stayed trading restrictions on eight of these companies after they approached the tribunal to seek reprieve terming the order as arbitrary. The tribunal‚Äôs order raises a question mark over the due diligence followed by the capital market regulator before passing the directive to stock exchanges. A close look at the financials of 162 actively traded companies at the BSE on the list shows that several companies have operational businesses and have been

reporting quarterly revenues and profits on a regular basis.

At least 11 companies on the list reported revenues of over Rs 150 crore each in the financial year ended March 2017. While all of them had market capitalisation in excess of Rs 200 crore as on August 7, all of these 11 companies, barring Parsvnath Developers, also announced a net profit of at least Rs 1 crore for the year ended March 2017. JKumar Infraprojects had announced a net profit of Rs 105 crore for the year ended March 2017, while Prakash Industries had a net profit of Rs 81 crore for the financial year and Pincon Spirit registered a profit of Rs 43 crore.

While Sebi‚Äôs decision to put some of these companies on the list of suspected ‚Äúshell companies‚Äù and restrict trading on them has been turned down by the SAT, even a task force on shell companies, constituted under the co-chairmanship of revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia and corporate affairs secretary Tapan Ray, is likely to seek an explanation from Sebi. A government official told The Indian Express that ‚Äúdue diligence‚Äù may not have been followed by Sebi in its order against the suspected ‚Äúshell‚Äù companies and the task force may ask it on the specific triggers that prompted the markets regulator to take action against 331 listed entities suspected to be shell companies.

Though many are raising questions over the sudden Sebi action without differentiating the bad ones from the better ones, a government official said that if some well-run companies has also been grouped with others, they would eventually come out of it.

A finance ministry official said that the ‚Äúregulator should not give prior notice to the companies suspect of wrongdoing, as this could alert them to set their house in order. The Sebi imposed initial restrictions to halt the entire process of converting black money into white through securities market‚Äù. While it may have caused temporary liquidity squeeze for some companies, it has had the desired effect on shell companies, the official said.

Even Sebi had, in the hearing of the petition filed by three companies in the SAT on August 10, told the tribunal that its action is not final and that it has not concluded that all the companies are ‚Äúshell companies‚Äù. Sebi also said that it has taken only a first-time action against the suspected companies after the corporate affairs ministry shortlisted the firms.

What does the list throw up

The aforementioned 11 companies had an aggregate revenue of Rs 10,262 crore for the year ended March 2017 and a combined net profit of Rs 335 crore. Their combined market capitalisation stood at over Rs 8,000 crore as on August 7. The 8 companies that have already got reprieve from the SAT against the Sebi directive are JKumar Infraprojects, Prakash Industries, SQS BFSI, Kkalpana Industries, Pincon Spirit, Signet Industries, Parsvnath Developers and Kavit Industries. The other three companies that have reported high revenues and profits but still have been clubbed with suspected shell companies by the regulator are Gallantt Ispat, Gallantt Metal and Adhunik Industries. While the two Gallant group companies reported revenues of over Rs 400 crore each and net profit in excess of Rs 25 crore each in the financial year ended March 2016, Adhunik Industries reported a net profit of Rs 2.3 crore over revenues of Rs 374 crore for the same period. Other than the 11 companies that have market capitalisation of over Rs 200 crore and a net profit of Rs 1 crore, there is another company Cybermate Infotek which reported a net profit of Rs 2.3 crore on a revenue of Rs 53 crore for FY17.

The Sebi list, on the other hand, also has many companies that either show no revenue or high revenues and no profits for a series of 3 years or more. One of the companies in the list is Dwitiya Trading. While the company announced revenues of Rs 0.99 crore, Rs 0.75 crore and Rs 0.41 crore in FY17, FY16 and FY15, respectively, it announced net profits of Rs 0.06 crore, 0.01 crore and 0.03 crore for the respective three years. Appu Marketing and Manufacturing commands a market capitalisation of Rs 200 crore but announced revenues and net profit of Rs 0.1 crore and 0.17 crore respectively. GV Films had no revenue in FY17 and a loss of Rs 9.3 crore. Similarly, Goenka Business and Finance Ltd, which had a market capitalisation of Rs 109 crore, declared revenues between Rs 2 crore and Rs 3.2 crore in the past three years and net profits between Rs 0.06 crore and 0.5 crore in the three years.

Then there is a long list of companies that announced high revenues over several years but negligible profits or losses. The list includes companies such as Unisys Software, VB Industries and BLS Infotech, among others. Unisys Software, for instance, has announced revenues of over Rs 450 crore in each of the past three years. However, it has declared net profits of Rs (-)0.04 crore to Rs 0.8 crore in the three years. Similarly, VB Industries though announced revenues of Rs 121 crore and Rs 145 crore in the last two years, its net profits stood at only Rs 0.06 crore and Rs 0.3 crore.

While the Sebi action came after the corporate affairs ministry shortlisted the names of the suspected companies in February 2017, the government had said that there are about 15 lakh registered companies in India and only 6 lakh companies file their annual return, implying that ‚Äúa large number of these companies may be indulging in financial irregularities‚Äù. On August 15, making his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government has cancelled registration of 1.75 lakh companies. Even the Minister of State for Corporate Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal on August 1 had said that the ministry has removed 1,62,618 companies from the register of companies as of July 12. These companies were removed as they have not been carrying any business or operation for two immediately preceding financial years. Section 248(1) of the Companies Act, 2013, empowers the government to remove name of company from the register of companies.

While market experts say that the action must be taken against companies not doing any business, they have raised questions over Sebi‚Äôs idea of imposing trade restriction on companies and closing the exit option for investors. They have also raised concerns over the Sebi order to put all companies in one basket and hurting the investor sentiment.

‚ÄúThe regulator‚Äôs action does not seem justified and because of their haste in passing out an order without a thorough due diligence, several companies and large number of investors have been impacted,‚Äù said the chief executive officer of a large brokerage firm, who did not want to be named.

Casteist remark by dean: witnesses turn hostile,"JJ Hospital JJ Hospital

OVER THREE years after JJ Hospital dean Dr T P Lahane was booked for allegedly making a casteist remark about a staffer, the prosecution has dropped the list of witnesses after two, including the complainant, turned hostile. On Monday, an eyewitness in the case, Lalit Solanki, began his deposition. The prosecution declared him hostile after he did not support its case.

The special court was also informed that there was an apprehension that other witnesses were not going to support the case either, since the complainant claims to have come to a ‚Äúcompromise out of court‚Äù. The prosecution will now examine the investigating officer. Lahane will then be expected to speak on his behalf under section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code. After that, the prosecution and defence will conclude their arguments and the court will pass its judgment.

In February 2014, around 500-600 employees working on a temporary basis at JJ Hospital had gone on a strike to seek permanent jobs. According to the initial complaint, the complainant, Naresh Waghela, along with his friends was standing outside the Outpatients Department on February 14, 2014. He had said that he saw a sweeper working, and went to convince him to support the strike. He claimed that Lahane and other staff told him and his friends to leave and let those who wanted to work continue. While in the FIR, the complainant had said that Lahane then abused him with a casteist remark, in his deposition he said that the part of the complaint was ‚Äúnot correct‚Äù.

Even as Lahane‚Äôs discharge application before the special court was pending, the complainant in March this year submitted that he wanted to withdraw the complaint. He initially made an oral submission, after which the court directed him to file an affidavit. In his subsequent affidavit, Waghela claimed that the complaint was filed in a state of ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù. He also submitted that he was not under any pressure, force or intimidation in taking the decision.

Since the provisions of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act under which Lahane is booked is non-compoundable, the court directed for the trial to continue.

"US President Donald Trump tweets weird articles of his ego-driven thoughts, spouts rubbish: North Korea","After a July missile test by North Korea, Trump went on Twitter to ask whether Kim has ‚Äúanything better to do with his life?‚Äù (Image source ‚Äì Reuters) After a July missile test by North Korea, Trump went on Twitter to ask whether Kim has ‚Äúanything better to do with his life?‚Äù (Image source ‚Äì Reuters)

North Korea today described President Donald Trump as a leader who frequently tweets ‚Äúweird articles of his ego-driven thoughts‚Äù and ‚Äúspouts rubbish‚Äù to give his assistants a hard time. The North‚Äôs official Korean Central News Agency made the comments in response to tough talk in Washington and Seoul over threats posed by Pyongyang‚Äôs nuclear and missile programs.

In the same commentary, KCNA also criticized South Korea‚Äôs ‚Äúpuppy-like‚Äù Defense Minister Song Young-moo, who it said was ‚Äúrunning wild‚Äù while relying on the ‚Äúmaster of the White House.‚Äù Song recently ordered the South‚Äôs military to be prepared to ‚Äúimmediately and sternly punish‚Äù any kind of provocation by North Korea, which has caused hostility with two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month and a threat to lob missiles toward the US territory of Guam.

‚ÄúTrump spouted rubbish that if a war breaks out, it would be on the Korean Peninsula, and if thousands of people die, they would be only Koreans and Americans may sleep a sound sleep,‚Äù KCNA wrote, ridiculing Song for ‚Äúpinning hope on that mad guy.‚Äù

The agency‚Äôs comments came hours after North Korea‚Äôs military issued its standard fiery threats over ongoing joint military exercises between the US and South Korean militaries, vowing ‚Äúmerciless retaliation‚Äù for exercises Pyongyang claims are an invasion rehearsal. The allies describe the annual war games as defensive in nature.

North Korea has unleashed personal attacks on past Washington and Seoul leaders, calling former President Barack Obama a monkey and ex-South Korean President Park Geun-hye a prostitute. Trump was previously described in North Korean state media as ‚Äúgoing senile‚Äù and a ‚Äúwar maniac bereft of reason.‚Äù

Trump has used Twitter to launch his own insults at North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong Un. On August 11, Trump tweeted that military solutions were ‚Äúfully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely‚Äù amid the standoff between Washington and Pyongyang over the Guam missile threat. But he complimented Kim five days later for making a ‚Äúvery wise and well reasoned decision‚Äù after Pyongyang walked away from the threat.

After a July missile test by North Korea, Trump went on Twitter to ask whether Kim has ‚Äúanything better to do with his life?‚Äù ‚ÄùHard to believe that South Korea ‚Ä¶ and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!‚Äù Trump wrote.

The Empire Gazes Back,"Applying Edward Said‚Äôs thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler‚Äôs Gaze is about. Applying Edward Said‚Äôs thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler‚Äôs Gaze is about.

In 1978, the Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said published a seminal treatment of how the Western world and its scholarship viewed the Islamic world of the Middle East. His central argument was: knowledge is embedded in equations of power and all Western scholarship on nonwestern societies is tainted by its association with imperialism. Power therefore defined knowledge. The reception of ‚ÄòOrientalism‚Äô is not surprising. The 1970s was an era when the west seemed to be rolling back. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan followed in 1979. The Shia revolution in Iran in the same year was as much an ideological and intellectual revolution against the West and the USA as a political revolution against the Shah. The spread of extremism and Islamic fundamentalism elsewhere challenged then, as it does now, deeply engrained notions of what constituted progress in Western eyes. Said‚Äôs book Orientalism became a classic, as it remains to this day.

Academic critiques of Said were no less powerful. Substantial parts of the book delved into periods when the Islamic world was not subordinated to the West. So, perceptions of Islam as degenerate and backward did not develop as a consequence of Western conquest but, in fact, had predated it. Said‚Äôs argument about power and knowledge was much criticised on this ground. But even at that time, there was the view that the perfect match to study the relationship between imperial power and knowledge was to be found not so much in the middle east but in colonial India.

Applying Edward Said‚Äôs thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler‚Äôs Gaze is about. Arvind Sharma is a professor of comparative religion in Montreal. This is, in part, an assimilative work drawing on a wide range of studies in the past quarter-century, which have asked questions like those he raises: How did colonial scholarship evolve, and how did the process of studying colonial subjects and themes also transform the colonies in greater or lesser measure? This is a book refreshingly free of jargon ‚Äî it‚Äôs a good point for the serious but general reader to start with to understand how much colonialism and imperialism permeated scholarship, and how very clearly the relationship between knowledge and power was understood by both sets of practitioners.

Sharma describes, as others have before him, how scholarship about India and Indians changed as the East India Company transformed itself from a trading enterprise to a political and then a colonial power. The initial fascination, even admiration, for India and things Indians, acquired through the 19th century gave way, especially after 1857, to deep biases arising from a sense of contempt. He also does well to remind us how intrinsic missionary activity was to the entire imperial project as critiques of Hinduism went hand in hand with efforts at conversion. Racism also permeated colonial scholarship to a greater extent than is generally conceded. I found one particular instance cited by Sharma striking. Annette Beveridge, wife of a British civil servant and scholar, was an accomplished Persian scholar in her own right. Her translation of Gulbadan Begum‚Äôs Humayun Namah in the late 19th century is a work of great sensitivity and charm, as a woman of the time sought to understand and contextualise the account of a Mughal princess in the 17th century. But Beveridge was also at the forefront of the agitation in India insisting that Indian judges not be allowed to try English or white people. Beveridge then wrote about the social ideas of Hindus as being ‚Äúon the outer verge of civilisation‚Äù and that she had no hesitation in calling them ‚Äúuncivilised a people which cares about stone idols, enjoys child marriage and secludes its women, and where at every point the fact of sex is present to the mind.‚Äù In brief, how could such people be allowed to try English men and women!

Nevertheless, this is not a book about the inequities of British rule in India (although there is some of that) but rather about how British scholarship was an exercise underwritten by power and at the same time directed at cementing a relationship of subjugation. Illustrating how such scholarship also transformed social realities in India is one of Sharma‚Äôs endeavors, as he takes us through themes of caste, race, religion, science, historical sense or lack of it, etc. If parts of this treatment would be familiar to scholars, there is also sufficient that is new and surprising enough to engage the general reader.

Sharma‚Äôs central thesis of power underwriting scholarship in colonial India is unexceptional. Nevertheless, his extension of Said‚Äôs Orientalism debate to India also raises other questions. Did Orientalism cease in 1947 with the end of political subjugation? Or does this approach continue, since in many ways the relationship between India and the West continues to have elements that are unequal. More problematic are the questions thrown up by Sharma‚Äôs suggestions that political domination is the key variable in determining perceptions. This explanation, however appealing, may also have limitations. What was characteristic about British scholarship of India in the colonial period was not just that the British ruled India. It was also the fact that the rulers came from a society and an age that had, since the Enlightenment, radically transformed ideas of knowledge and how it was to be collected, organised and disseminated. This gave to knowledge production in colonial India features not encountered in earlier and other situations of political domination.

The Ruler‚Äôs Gaze is a thought provoking and imaginative work that furthers the debate about how profoundly British colonialism affected India and Indians.

I have the hunger to go further than next Ashes series: Stuart Broad,"Stuart Broad not only seems hopeful about the upcoming Ashes series but also expressed his desire to the play the next one in 2019. (Source: AP) Stuart Broad not only seems hopeful about the upcoming Ashes series but also expressed his desire to the play the next one in 2019. (Source: AP)

With over 700 wickets between the two, Stuart Broad and James Anderson form one of the most successful opening bowling combination in recent times. With the upcoming Ashes series, Stuart Broad not only seems hopeful about the upcoming series but also expressed his desire to the play the next one in 2019.

According to a report in cricket.au.com, expressing hope to play in the next Ashes series, Broad, said, ‚ÄúOh God, yes, I hope so. I‚Äôll be just turned 33. Jimmy is 35 now so I‚Äôd certainly hope my performances will keep improving to be a part of that Ashes for sure.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not someone who looks too far ahead because I think it slows you down as a performer. This winter is a hugely exciting one because I think that series is going to be a belter with two teams that look really similar. But obviously, I have the hunger to go further than that.‚Äù

Commenting on senior partner James Anderson, Broad, said, ‚ÄúTo be fair, Jimmy is bowling as well as I‚Äôve seen him bowl. He‚Äôs turned 35 but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen him challenge both sides of the bat as consistently as he has done this summer. Fielding at mid-on and mid-off to him, I feel like he is in the game all the time. He‚Äôs not bowling bad balls, he looks in a rhythm that‚Äôs awesome. Long may that continue.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is taking regular wickets, both LB and bowled and nicking off. That‚Äôs a great place for him to be. Look, he‚Äôs going to be crucial for our chances this winter for sure and hopefully he can keep that rhythm going because he is picking up wickets at a huge speed at the moment and, not only will he be looking at 500, he‚Äôll be looking way past that the way he is going.‚Äù, Broad added.

Broad also spoke on his current fitness and longevity, Broad said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 31 now and still feel like I have quite a bit of cricket left in me. I‚Äôm loving the energy around this team, I‚Äôm loving being part of it. At 31 I‚Äôve hopefully, touch wood, got a few more miles in the tank.‚Äù

Finnish police investigating stabbing spree as terror crime,"Armed Finnish policemen on guard at the Helsinki airport on Friday, Aug. 18, 2017, as Finnish authorities announced they will raise readiness levels after an incident in Turku Finland. (Lehtikuva via AP) Armed Finnish policemen on guard at the Helsinki airport on Friday, Aug. 18, 2017, as Finnish authorities announced they will raise readiness levels after an incident in Turku Finland. (Lehtikuva via AP)

Finnish police are investigating Friday‚Äôs knife attacks that killed two and wounded eight in the city of Turku as terrorism-related crimes, they said on Saturday. The suspect arrested on Friday was an 18-year-old Moroccan, police said, adding that the two people killed were Finns and an Italian and two Swedish citizens were among the injured.

The attacks shocked the Nordic country where violent crime is relatively rare and which has been named as the world‚Äôs safest place to visit by the World Economic Forum. Following the attacks on Friday, police shot the suspected attacker in the leg and arrested him. ‚ÄúDue to information received during the night, the Turku stabbings are now being investigated as murders with terrorist intent,‚Äù the National Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.

Security was reinforced nationwide with increased patrols and more surveillance in case more people were involved. ‚ÄúFirst thing we heard was a young woman, screaming like crazy. I thought it‚Äôs just kids having fun ‚Ä¶ but then people started to move around and I saw a man with a knife in his hand, stabbing a woman,‚Äù said Laura Laine, who was sitting in a cafe during one of the attacks.

‚ÄúThen a person ran towards us shouting ‚Äòhe has a knife‚Äô, and everybody from the terrace ran inside. Next, a woman came in to the cafe. She was crying hysterically, down on her knees, saying someone‚Äôs neck has been slashed open.‚Äù The police arrested a number of people during the night as part of their investigation.

Local media said the police raided an apartment in the eastern Turku suburb of Varissuo, which is home to a large immigrant population and located about 7 kilometers from the market square where the attack took place. The arrested suspect had been in Finland for only a short time before the attack, Helsingin Sanomat newspaper reported. The police will hold a news conference at 1100 GMT.

Four of the wounded were still in hospital, three of them in intensive care, while the other injured persons would be sent home on Saturday, the hospital said. Flags were at half mast on Saturday across the Nordic country whose Security Intelligence Service (SIS) raised the terrorism threat level in June to ‚Äòelevated‚Äô from ‚Äòlow‚Äô, saying it had become aware of terrorism-related plans in Finland.

Leaders of Turku‚Äôs Iraqi and Syrian community condemned the attacks and said they would hold a rally of solidarity in the city‚Äôs main square. An anti-immigration group was planning a demonstration in Helsinki. The SIS has said anti-immigration groups have been on the rise in the country after it received about 32,500 asylum seekers during the migration crisis in 2015.

‚ÄúTerrorists want to pit people against each other. We will not let this happen. Finnish society will not be defeated by fear or hatred,‚Äù Interior Minister Paula Risikko said on Twitter. On Thursday, a suspected Islamist militant drove a van into crowds in Barcelona, Spain, killing 13 people and wounding scores of others.

Indian bowler Jhulan Goswami‚Äôs World Cup 2017 semi-final jersey would be put on the walls of Fanattic Sports Museum.

Talking about the final match‚Äôs jersey Goswami told that the jersey she donned in the final against England is at the Lord‚Äôs.

‚ÄúThe jersey I wore in the final is at the Lord‚Äôs along with (captain) Mithali Raj‚Äôs. I have heard the museum has an amazing collection, so hope this sporting memorabilia will inspire youngsters to take up sport,‚Äù she added.

The women‚Äôs cricket team rode on Harmanpreet‚Äôs emphatic century to compile a total of 281/4 in 42 overs and in reply, the bowlers did the job to bundle out the Australians for 245 runs. India won the match by 36 runs. While they made a berth into the final of a women‚Äôs World Cup for the second time, unfortunately India lost the final at the hands of England.

At 191 for the loss of three wickets, India were the favourites to chase the 229-run target and win their first World Cup title. But, a stunning collapse which saw them lose seven wickets for 28 runs and were bowled out for 219 in 48.2 overs as England clinched their fourth World Cup title after the nine-run win in the final at Lord‚Äôs, thanks to a six-wicket haul from pacer Anya Shrubsole who ran through the India tail and win the final for England.

Large protests could greet President Donald Trump on Tuesday when he travels to Arizona for his first campaign rally since he caused an uproar with his remarks about a white nationalist demonstration in Virginia. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, asked the Republican president to postpone Tuesday‚Äôs event scheduled for 7 p.m. MST (0200 GMT on Wednesday) in light of his response to the street battles that broke out earlier this month at a protest against the removal of a Confederate statue in Charlottesville.

Trump was widely criticized for blaming both white nationalists and counter-protesters for the violence at the rally organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. ‚ÄúAmerica is hurting. And it is hurting largely because Trump has doused racial tensions with gasoline,‚Äù Stanton wrote in the Washington Post. ‚ÄúWith his planned visit to Phoenix on Tuesday, I fear the president may be looking to light a match.‚Äù Several anti-Trump demonstrations are planned for Phoenix, according to social media postings by local activists.

Some White House officials privately expressed concern on Monday about Trump‚Äôs Phoenix rally, fearing he might revisit the Charlottesville issue in the heat of the moment while cheered on by thousands of supporters. It will be Trump‚Äôs first trip as president to Arizona, which he won in the 2016 election. He will also visit a border protection facility in Yuma, Arizona, along the U.S.-Mexican border as he seeks congressional funding for the wall he wants built.. While in Yuma, Trump will view equipment used to secure the border and attend a briefing on border protection, the White House Department of Homeland Security officials told reporters on Tuesday that Yuma was an example of how adding barriers at the border could lower unlawful immigration. The area has seen an 82 percent decrease in illegal entries since 2007 after a fence was installed. Republican Governor Doug Ducey told the Arizona Republic on Monday that he would welcome Trump on the tarmac when he arrived but would not attend the campaign rally.

Trump has clashed with Arizona‚Äôs two Republican US senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, on various issues. Both lawmakers are critics of the president. Trump said earlier this month that he was considering pardoning Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff found guilty of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case.

Sitaram Yechury hits out at Amit Shah over ‚ÄòNew India‚Äô remarks,"Addressing a public discussion in New Delhi, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, without naming any party, alleged that superstition was being misused for political intention in the country. Addressing a public discussion in New Delhi, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, without naming any party, alleged that superstition was being misused for political intention in the country.

The CPI(M) on Tuesday hit out at BJP president Amit Shah over his ‚ÄúNew India‚Äù remarks relating to the Supreme Court‚Äôs judgment quashing triple talaq, alleging a ‚Äúpost-truth society‚Äù was being created in the country and ‚Äúall understand‚Äù that Muslims was the target.

Post-truth, the Oxford dictionary word of the year for 2016, is defined as ‚Äòrelating to/denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief‚Äô.

Shah said the apex court‚Äôs judgment on triple talaq was a beginning of a new epoch of self-respect and equality for Muslim women and that the BJP saw it as ‚Äúa resolute step towards a New India‚Äù. The CPI(M) had earlier in the day welcomed the Supreme Court‚Äôs verdict treating ‚Äúarbitrary and instant‚Äù triple talaq as unconstitutional. It, however, sought to wait till it went through the detailed judgement before responding properly on the issue.

Addressing a public discussion in New Delhi, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, without naming any party, alleged that superstition was being misused for political intention in the country. He claimed that the intention of those doing so was to replace the secular democratic republic of the country into a ‚ÄúHindu Rashtra or Hindu Pakistan‚Äù for political gains.

‚ÄúBJP chief Amit Shah today talked about ‚ÄòNew India‚Äô while speaking on triple talaq. He congratulated (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi Sahab. ‚ÄúWhat has Modi Sahab got to do on this? But he is being congratulated,‚Äù Yechury said at the discussion.

The discussion was organised by the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti and the Delhi Andhavishwas Unmulan Samiti here. Yechury added, ‚ÄúThey (BJP) are saying India is becoming forward. Who is the target? All understand. Triple talaq is related to Muslims. The judgement has come against Muslims, target the community, that is, the country is moving forward. The post-truth is being created.‚Äù

Yechury though said he was yet to read the entire judgement. The Marxist leader alleged Modi was following the logic of late Bollywood filmmaker Manmohan Desai who, he said, was of the view that a film should be such that it did not give people time to think of anything else.

Similarly, Yechury alleged, Modi was not giving people time to think about anything else and doling out schemes such as ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô. He described rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, who was killed four years ago, as a ‚Äúleading light‚Äù in the battle against unreason.

Speaking at the event, CPI national secretary D Raja said intolerance was allegedly growing in the country and that such an atmosphere had to be fought to take the country forward. RJD leader Manoj Jha, Swami Agnivesh, Delhi University professor Apoorvanand and scientist Gauhar Raza also addressed the event.

Bangladesh: Ten sentenced to death for attempting to assassinate PM Sheikh Hasina,"PM Sheikh Hasina narrowly escaped the attack that killed 23 people and injured hundreds. PM Sheikh Hasina narrowly escaped the attack that killed 23 people and injured hundreds.

Ten militants on Sunday were sentenced to death and nine others jailed for 20 years each by a court in Bangladesh for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2000. The convicts had hatched the plot to kill Hasina in 2000 by planting a high-powered explosive device at an open ground at her village home in southwestern Gopalganj where she was scheduled to address a public rally. Security officials, however, detected the bomb ahead of the rally.

On further investigation, outlawed Harkatul Jihad-e-Islami Bangladesh (HuJI) chief Mufti Hannan, who was executed earlier this year in another case involving attempted assassination of the then Bangladeshi-origin British High Commissioner, was found to be the mastermind of the plot.

Twenty-five suspects had been accused in the Special Powers Act case. Nine received 20 years in prison and were fined 20,000 taka each, while four were acquitted. ‚ÄúThey (convicts) will be executed either by hanging or by shooting with permission of the High Court,‚Äù Dhaka‚Äôs Speedy Trial Tribunal-2 judge Mamtaz Begum said. Only eight of the accused faced the trial in person while the rest were sentenced in absentia.

Under the Bangladesh law, the death sentences would require to be endorsed by the High Court following an automatic death reference hearing. The convicts are allowed to file an appeal as well. The judgment came a Dhaka court nearly ended trial of another major assassination attempt on Hasina while she was the opposition leader as the chief of the Awami League in 2004.

An influential group of the then ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of ex-premier Khaleda Zia is believed to have masterminded the plot engaging HuJI to execute it. Hasina narrowly escaped the attack that killed 23 people and injured hundreds.

BNP leader and Zia‚Äôs son Tarique Rahman is being tried in the case in absentia as a prime accused. ‚ÄúThe verdict of the case is expected by the year end,‚Äù a court official familiar with the development said.

"INX case: Madras High Court declines relief to Karti Chidambaram, nod to move Delhi court","Karti Chidambaram (PTI /File photo) Karti Chidambaram (PTI /File photo)

The Madras High Court on Tuesday refrained from granting any relief to former Union minister P Chidambaram‚Äôs son Karti, who sought quashing of the FIR filed by the CBI and its subsequent summonses in the INX Media case. Justice P Velmurugan directed the court registry to return all the papers in the case to the petitioner so as to enable him approach the Delhi High Court which has superintendence powers in the matter. The judge had on August 16 reserved orders on maintainability of Karti‚Äôs petitions seeking to quash the FIR and summons related to the case pending in a CBI special court in Delhi. Before the verdict was pronounced on Tuesday, the media was asked to leave the courtroom.

In his order, the judge held that the petitions filed by Karti were maintainable and the high court had territorial jurisdiction.

But, in the interest of justice, and in order to avoid conflicting views in case any of the parties (other accused) moved the Delhi or Bombay High Court, the court held it was inclined to adopt the ‚Äòdoctrine of forum of convenience‚Äô so that parties could move the convenient court.

On May 15, an FIR was registered by CBI against Karti and INX Media along with eight others for alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to the media house for receiving foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2007 when his father was the finance minister.

The probe agency had claimed the FDI proposal of the media house was ‚Äúfallacious‚Äù but Chidambaram had cleared it.

The CBI had on July 19 issued summons, the second by the agency in the case, asking Karti to appear before it two days later.

Earlier, it had asked Karti and four others to appear for questioning on June 27 and 29. Karti had then informed the CBI through his lawyer that he needed more time to appear.

The agency had alleged that a firm ‚Äúindirectly controlled‚Äù by Karti had received money from INX Media, run by Indrani and Peter Mukerjea in 2007.

During the hearing of the petitions earlier, the CBI had opposed them arguing they were not maintainable and wanted the court to dismiss them.

In May, the CBI had conducted raids at the premises of Karti, Peter and Indrani at 14 locations in Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai in connection with the case.

Incidentally, during the pendency of the petition challenging the summons, a ‚Äòlook out circular‚Äô was issued by the government against Karti and subsequently stayed by the high court.

However, the Supreme Court had on August 14 stayed the high court order on an appeal by the Centre after observing that Karti had not joined the investigation in the case.

"GST pulls down India Inc net profit by 15.7%, says report","India Inc‚Äôs profits plunged by 15.7 per cent to Rs 87,475 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal, largely owing to destocking of goods by companies before execution of GST regime from July 1, a leading rating agency said in a report. Small companies bore the brunt of the GST regime with profits plunging as much as 78 per cent in the quarter.

‚ÄúThe overall performance has been driven by the large companies that accounted for over 75 per cent of the share in terms of total net sales. They recorded lower net profits of about 23.2 per cent y-o-y in Q1 FY18. Those at the lower end of the size scales witnessed negative growth in both sales and profit,‚Äù Care Ratings said in a report. Net sales growth was lower at 8.7 per cent to Rs 14.82 lakh crore in Q1 FY18 after registering a growth of 9.5 per cent in Q1 FY17.

According to an analysis of 2,108 companies by Care Ratings, during Q1 FY18, all companies faced the heat of the uncertainties revolving around the implementation of GST by the government as most companies were destocking goods before July 1 and operations were impacted quite markedly. While companies with net sales more than Rs 100 crore managed to post cumulative profits in absolute values (however, lower than that in Q1 FY17), small companies posted a cumulative loss of Rs 674 crore during the quarter, it said.

‚ÄúCompanies with sales between Rs 100 crore and Rs 250 crore posted the highest decline of 78.1 per cent in net profit during the quarter from Rs 870 crore in Q1 of FY17 to Rs 191 crore in Q1 of FY18,‚Äù it said.

Industries related to households where demand is inelastic remained largely stable with minimal slowdown. However, pharmaceuticals and drugs industry saw a sharp dip on account of lower exports. ‚ÄúConsumer industries like textiles and durables which get extended to auto segment except tractors witnessed an improvement as players were destocking inventories before implementation of GST which led to higher sales,‚Äù the report said.

In the case of tractors a good monsoon was a factor pushing growth. ‚ÄúTyres and ancillary growth may be attributed to the ‚Äòreplacement‚Äô demand more than OEM which slowed down during the quarter. Within non-discretionary consumer goods consumer foods, household and personal goods segment as well as drugs and pharmaceuticals were affected,‚Äù it said.

Services like telecom service providers were affected most perceptibly while hospitals and retailing were also on the downslide. ‚ÄúGrowth in everything related to real estate ‚Äì construction, cement, engineering construction declined but was restricted as marginal signs of improvement in demand post demonetisation were seen. The finance companies however did well ‚Äî both housing finance and NBFCs,‚Äù the report said.

‚ÄúMost of the industries in Q1 FY18 that have posted lower growth numbers were affected by the destocking goods before implementation of GST from July 1, 2017 by the government. The effect was felt most of the companies as we can also see from the financials. This led to slower movement in the consumer durables, industrial activity, etc which led to comparatively lower sales during the quarter,‚Äù it said.

As many as seven industries reported net loss, while 33 segments reported lower growth in net profit on year-on- year basis during the quarter ended June 2017. In terms of net sales, 40 industries saw positive growth in sales in the first quarter of 2017-18. Some of the leading industries include sugar, electronics, passenger cars and tractors, capital goods, metals, NBFCs, hotels, resorts and restaurants, mining, refineries, plastic products, industrial gases and fuels.

"Darjeeling protest: Ready for discussion on issue on August 29, says Mamata Banerjee","Darjeeling unrest: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced that a dialogue will be initiated to discuss the Darjeeling issue on August 29 at Nabanna. Darjeeling unrest: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced that a dialogue will be initiated to discuss the Darjeeling issue on August 29 at Nabanna.

In response to the Gorkha National Liberation Front chief Mann Ghising‚Äôs request to call for peace talks, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday announced that a dialogue will be initiated to discuss the Darjeeling issue on August 29 at Nabanna.

The Home Ministry has been urging the state government to initiate a dialogue with the Gorkhaland statehood movement after they met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on August 12. ‚ÄúInitially, the West Bengal CM was very upset with what appeared to be a bipartite meeting between the leaders of the statehood movement and the Home Minister. But it was clarified that it wasn‚Äôt the case,‚Äù said an official at state secretariat Nabanna had told the Indian Express.

On August 21, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) had requested the Centre and the Bengal government to initiate talks to restore peace in Darjeeling where indefinite strike has entered its 68th day. According to a PTI report, Binay Tamang said, ‚ÄúThe responsibility of ensuring peace in the Darjeeling hills, Terai and Dooars is not only that of the people who live here, but also that of the central government and the West Bengal government. We, therefore, request both the governments to initiate talks at the earliest so that peace and normalcy can be restored.‚Äù

GJM chief Bimal Gurung was also booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in connection with twin blasts that rocked Darjeeling on August 19. Tamang, however criticised the blasts and said, ‚ÄúWe condemn the blasts which took place in Darjeeling town and Kalimpong and we have already demanded a probe by NIA into the blasts on Saturday last.‚Äù

"Triple talaq ruling today, petitioner‚Äôs brother says ‚Äòit‚Äôs about all sisters‚Äô","Triple Talaq verdict: Shayara Bano at her parents‚Äô home in Kashipur. File photo Triple Talaq verdict: Shayara Bano at her parents‚Äô home in Kashipur. File photo

*At age 36, Shayara Bano is battling multiple ailments following multiple abortions. Her husband of 15 years sent her a talaqnama (divorce) by post while she was with her parents at their home in Kashipur, Uttarakhand.

* Ishrat Jahan is 30. Her husband uttered talaq three times over phone and allegedly took away her four children, leaving her at the mercy of her extended family in Howrah.

* The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) signed a letter containing a petition titled ‚ÄòMuslim Women‚Äôs Quest for Equality‚Äô. A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court took suo motu cognisance of the petition.

All three are petitioners in what is now called the triple talaq case. On Tuesday, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court will give its ruling on a clutch of petitions which have challenged the practice of triple talaq as ‚Äúunlawful and unconstitutional‚Äù.

Triple Talaq LIVE Updates: Supreme Court to pronounce judgment today

The verdict by the bench comprising Chief Justice of India J S Khehar and Justices Kurian Joseph, R F Nariman, U U Lalit and Abdul Nazeer is to be pronounced at 10.30 am. The bench had reserved its verdict on May 18 after hearing it for six days starting May 11 during the summer recess.

Shayara Bano and her family are preparing to reach Delhi from Kashipur Tuesday morning. Hopes are high, says her brother Arshad Ali. ‚ÄúIt is not just about my sister. It is about all my sisters across the country, it is about future generations,‚Äù Ali told The Indian Express over phone.

In the court, her lawyer had contended: ‚ÄúThe Muslim husband‚Äôs right to ask for divorce by uttering talaq three times in a row is completely unilateral, unguided, absolute and has no rationale. It cannot be identified with Muslim culture and is not part of Muslim law. So it is not part of religion and, hence, not part of the right to practice or propagate religion and deserves no protection.‚Äù

Ishrat Jahan‚Äôs lawyer V K Biju said: ‚ÄúI did ask her to come, I do not know if she will be able to. She has been unreachable for some time. She lost her four children and her husband divorced her over phone. She fought back to prevent his second marriage. She was attacked and landed in the Calcutta Medical College.‚Äù

Zakia Soman of the BMMA said: ‚ÄúWe are hopeful that the verdict will be in favour of women. Triple talaq should not have been allowed in the first place. It is high time that this huge anomaly that has gone on for seven decades be addressed. The legal process really is a small part of the much longer process of social reform but it will be a beginning. Our petition, Muslim Women‚Äôs Quest for Equality, was taken suo motu cognizance by the bench of Justice (Anil R) Dave and Justice (Adarsh Kumar) Goel and now we are one of the petitioners in the case. We have also submitted our triple talaq case studies to the court.‚Äù

In the court, the BMMA‚Äôs primary argument has been Quranic ‚Äî that Allah said men and women are equal. ‚ÄúWe have reproduced verses from the Quran about talaq, negotiations and how it should happen over a minimum period of 90 days. The second argument is about gender justice. There is no ambiguity in the Constitution of India about all citizens having equal rights,‚Äù Soman said.

Balaji Srinivasan and Divyesh Pratap Singh, lawyers of Gulshan Parween and Aafreen Rehman, said they too have not been able to contact the women. ‚ÄúBut they will all be there at the court tomorrow. It is a big day, the glass ceiling will be broken,‚Äù Srinivasan said. Parween from Rampur, Rehman from Jaipur and Atiya Sabri from Saharanpur are the other petitioners in the case.

Former Union Minister Arif Mohd Khan, who quit the Rajiv Gandhi government in 1986 to protest its stand on the Shah Bano case, described the triple talaq practice as equivalent to burying alive Muslim women. Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, however, took the stand that triple talaq was a matter of faith and the court should not interfere.

Former Union Minister Salman Khurshid, who was allowed by the court to assist it as amicus curiae, told the bench that the system of instant triple talaq ‚Äúcannot be justified or given legal validity‚Äù. He said the practice ‚Äúwas sinful but legal‚Äù, prompting one of the judges to wonder whether ‚Äúsomething abhorred by religion can be made law by man‚Äù.

During the hearing, it was also pointed out to the court that many Islamic nations across the world, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt do not recognise the husband‚Äôs right to unilaterally divorce through triple talaq and that Sri Lanka was one of the non-Islamic countries to ban it. The court, however, wondered how Muslim men would divorce if it held all forms of talaq as unconstitutional.

The then Attorney General, Mukul Rohtagi, assured the court that the Centre will come up with a law to deal with any such situation. The Centre had taken the stand that triple talaq was ‚Äúextra-judicious‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù.

Though CJI Khehar said that courts had limitations interpreting the tenets of a faith, Justice Nariman pointed out that this was why there was the ‚Äúessential test‚Äù.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why the test of essential (whether the practice under challenge is essential to the practice of religion). All practices do not get protection,‚Äù he said.

Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina blasts Chief Justice amid growing row,"Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina

Amid a raging row with the Supreme Court, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today slammed Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha for comparing Bangladesh with Pakistan and accused him of ‚Äúhumiliating‚Äù the country. Sinha, the first Hindu apex court chief justice in this Muslim-majority country, yesterday said that the judiciary has been very patient and referred to the removal of Pakistan‚Äôs Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by the country‚Äôs apex court.

‚ÄúWe are being very, very patient. The Supreme Court of Pakistan removed the prime minister. Was there any criticism over it? No,‚Äù Sinha told an open court hearing. Commenting on Sinha‚Äôs remarks, Hasina said this cannot be accepted that a Pakistan court removed their premier through a verdict and that will be used as a threat in Bangladesh. ‚ÄúHe should have quit‚Ä¶The most humiliating thing is the comparison with Pakistan which is intolerable,‚Äù Hasina said, without mentioning Chief Justice Sinha‚Äôs name.

‚ÄúThere would be no benefit in giving me such a threat (of removal),‚Äù she said, asserting that she is not scared at all. ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs court is the biggest court; no one can ignore people‚Äôs court‚Ä¶I‚Äôm lodging my complaint with this court‚Ä¶ I want justice from the court of people,‚Äù she said.

A number of senior government leaders virtually attacked the chief justice over a recent verdict declaring void 16th constitutional amendment scrapping parliament‚Äôs authority in impeaching Supreme Court judges. The government is reviewing the judgment to overturn it for being ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù. Hasina said the apex court defamed the parliament and attempted to snatch the presidential authority.

‚ÄúWhen you (chief justice) make criticism in this regard, then you will have to accept other‚Ä¶so you should have stepped down before making such a comment,‚Äù she said. Opposition party outside parliament BNP of ex-premier Khaleda Zia backed Sinha, saying the government was trying to control the higher judiciary by launching a vigorous campaign against the apex court judgment.

The row emerged in May when the apex court first refused to accept a government formulated code of conduct for lower judiciary judges, saying it undermined the Supreme Court in regulating them. Bangladesh‚Äôs original 1972 Constitution had empowered parliament to remove Supreme Court judges but a 1975 amendment entrusted the President with the authority.

In a subsequent amendment in 1978, when a military regime was in power, the authority was bestowed on Supreme Judicial Council, comprising apex court judges.

"Born in Amritsar jail, 11-year-old girl may soon go home to Pakistan","(From left) Mumtaz, Fatima and Hena with Fauzia Manzoor, counseller, Pakistan High Commission in India, and women rights activist and lawyer Navjot Kaur Chabba. (From left) Mumtaz, Fatima and Hena with Fauzia Manzoor, counseller, Pakistan High Commission in India, and women rights activist and lawyer Navjot Kaur Chabba.

ON MAY 8, 2006, Fatima Bibi and Mumtaz, who are sisters and Pakistani nationals, were arrested on charges of drug trafficking from Attari railway station. A court subsequently convicted and sentenced them to 10 years in jail. Fatima was pregnant at the time of her arrest and gave birth to a baby girl in Amritsar jail and named her Hena. Now 11, she has lived in jail with her mother all these years.

However, there is hope that Hena may soon go to her home country ‚Äî Pakistan ‚Äî for the first time, along with her mother and maternal aunt. Although a local court had offered to make arrangements for sending the girl to Pakistan after her birth, her mother was firm that she wanted to keep Hena with her.

Fauzia Manzoor, counseller, Pakistan High Commission in India, visited Amritsar central jail Monday to confirm the nationality of the trio as part of routine procedure before release of such prisoners. Officials of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and women rights activist and lawyer Navjot Kaur Chabba also accompanied Manzoor.

Chabba told The Indian Express that the dispute over the nationality of Hena had been resolved and Pakistan would arrange for her entry into the country. ‚ÄúFauzia Manzoor made it clear that Hena would be treated as a Pakistan citizen. She will go to Pakistan along with her mother and aunt,‚Äù said Chabba. She said, ‚ÄúHena goes to a government senior secondary school near central jail. She is now a student of Class VII.‚Äù

‚ÄúPakistan will give new passports to Fatima Bibi and Mumtaj. In Hena‚Äôs case, they will provide a passport to her to enter Pakistan for the first time,‚Äù said Chabba. Batala-based NGO Sarbat Da Bhala had paid Rs 4 lakh (Rs 2 lakh each) fine in April this year as part of sentence to start the procedure for the release of the trio.

Recently, the Centre cleared the file related to their release and issued a no-objection certificate. Now, an NOC from the home department of Punjab government is awaited. Fatima Bibi belongs to Gujranwala and her sister, who is unmarried, is from Sikandarabad in Pakistan. They were arrested with 400 gm smack from the Samjhauta Express train at Attari railway station in 2006.

AC Milan completes signing of forward Nikola Kalinic on four-year deal,"Kalinic, who also played for Blackburn Rovers in the English Premier League, moved to Italy in 2015 and had 33 goals in 83 appearances for Fiorentina. (Source: AP) Kalinic, who also played for Blackburn Rovers in the English Premier League, moved to Italy in 2015 and had 33 goals in 83 appearances for Fiorentina. (Source: AP)

AC Milan CEO Marco Fassone hinted the club has finished its summer spending spree after signing its 11th player in this transfer window: Nikola Kalinic.

Milan signed Kalinic from Fiorentina on a one-year loan deal with the obligation to buy, with the Croatia forward penning a four-year contract on Tuesday to June 30, 2021.

‚ÄúWith Nikola we‚Äôve completed the team,‚Äù Fassone said.

Milan, which was bought by a Chinese-led consortium in April, has spent more than 200 million euros ($234 million) in the offseason, signing players such as Leonardo Bonucci, Andre Silva, Ricardo Rodriguez, Franck Kessie, Andrea Conti, Hakan Calhanoglu, Lucas Biglia and Mateo Musacchio.

‚Äú(Kalinic) is the player we wanted to complete the squad because he has experience and quality,‚Äù Fassono said. ‚ÄúWe always said we wanted to have a mix of young and talented players and experienced ones, to build a spine of experienced players.

‚ÄúWe got Bonucci, we got Biglia, we got Nikola, who completes the squad.‚Äù

Milan was in talks with Fiorentina for the 29-year-old Kalinic from mid-June, and he missed training last week as he attempted to push through the move.

‚ÄúI have to say this has been a long and difficult story, more than two months,‚Äù Fassone said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here because he (Kalinic) wanted to become a Rossonero so strongly. He has a boundless and historic love for our shirt and that‚Äôs what allowed us to unlock this long negotiation that we had with Fiorentina.‚Äù

Kalinic, who also played for Blackburn Rovers in the English Premier League, moved to Italy in 2015 and had 33 goals in 83 appearances for Fiorentina. He said he preferred to do his talking on the pitch.

Kalinic will wear the No. 7 shirt, which was worn by one of Milan‚Äôs best-ever forwards, Andriy Shevchenko.

No financial details were disclosed, but reports say Milan will pay Fiorentina 25 million euros ($29 million) for Kalinic.

Milan, which last won the league in 2011, opened its Serie A campaign with a 3-0 win at Crotone. It also beat Shkendija 6-0 in the Europa League last Thursday.

The Bannon effect: Alt-right crusader who always had Trump‚Äôs ear till his exit,"FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to chief strategist Steve Bannon during a swearing in ceremony for senior staff at the White House in Washington, U.S. January 22, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/FILE PHOTO TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to chief strategist Steve Bannon during a swearing in ceremony for senior staff at the White House in Washington, U.S. January 22, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/FILE PHOTO TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY

Stephen K. Bannon, US President Donald Trump‚Äôs embattled chief strategist and his most controversial adviser, has been the latest senior White House official to be ousted from the Trump administration amidst another major shake up. Almost immediately he has returned to Breitbart, the far-right news outlet, where he had been the editor-in-chief prior to joining the Trump administration. Bannon‚Äôs clashes with other members of the administration (often made public by himself) and Trump‚Äôs son-in-law and top White House adviser, Jared Kushner, reportedly paved the way for his firing. His departure marked the fourth senior official in five weeks to leave the Trump administration after Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer in July and Michael Flynn in February.

The appointment of Bannon, the right wing media entrepreneur with a very distinct worldview, to a top position in Trump administration in November 2016 was widely perceived as a bad sign, especially by a large number of Americans who may have been willing to give the President-elect the benefit of the doubt. Bannon‚Äôs inclusion meant having an alt-right crusader in the White House and the first of realisations that as President, Trump wasn‚Äôt going to try and build a broader support base. NPR puts it well: ‚ÄúBannon‚Äôs fingerprints are everywhere, from Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô doctrine to the dark vision laid out in his inaugural address.‚Äù So now that he‚Äôs gone, does that portend a good sign for the White House?

The Bannon effect

To be sure, it is a milestone for the Trump administration which he has influenced in profound ways. Since the time Bannon became the CEO of the Trump campaign in August 2016, he consistently echoed Trump‚Äôs populist, nativist and anti-globalist passions and as his Chief Strategist, encouraged him to stay true to his promises to his white nationalist support base. Most recently Trump‚Äôs comments on Charlottesville violence, citing moral equivalence between the white supremacists and their detractors, disappointed his aides and party members and left much of America indignant and furious but reportedly found the resonance and support of Bannon.

In his short-lived political career, Bannon helped architect the isolationist and anti-immigrant policies of the new administration, including the US‚Äôs pull out from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Paris climate accord. His towering contribution was the controversial travel ban on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries, which was eventually blocked by the courts (a much-scaled down version has been recently let through), along with the suspension of US‚Äôs refugee programs. His was a powerful voice that had Trump‚Äôs ear against the many others who would have preferred for him as President to behave more conventionally and in a manner less alienating to the majority of Americans and the world.

This clear initial influence of Bannon on Trump attracted attention in the form of appearance on the February cover of Time magazine and his famous portrayal in an SNL sketch as the dark skeleton behind the scenes ‚Äî the real in-charge at the White House. Such an open blindsiding did not please Trump and Bannon was partially reined in. From a lower profile, Bannon continued to try and steer the administration‚Äôs trade and economic policy left along the lines of his economic, America-first nationalism, and against others whom he saw as the ‚Äòestablishment‚Äô and the ‚Äòglobalists‚Äô. This is where his efforts ran into direct conflict with several members of the administration including Kushner, whom Bannon saw as too obligated to business and New York elite opinion, and the National Economic Policy Council advisor, Gary Cohn. Bannon‚Äôs suggestions for infrastructure spending, tougher trade policy with China and increasing the tax on the wealthy were ignored or waylaid by the Trump administration, which generally carried along the conventional Republican path, when it came to economics. Bannon was thus increasingly perceived by other White House officials as a mischief maker, committed to pushing his ideological agenda over working for the success of the overall administration.

Losing the whisperer

With Bannon gone, Trump has lost an adviser deeply committed to operationalising the agenda of white nationalism ‚Äî someone who, as Vox frames it, ‚Äúcared about policy details and lower-level personnel appointments, rather than just presidential tweets or statements.‚Äù While that is anything but unwelcome, political analysts feel that Bannon‚Äôs exit is unlikely to alter the Trump administration in high-profile ways. Bannon had been unsuccessful as it is, in pushing his economic nationalism. On immigration policy, fellow hardliners Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller are still going to be around. On race-related controversies, Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that his own instincts are quite similar to that of his former Chief Strategist‚Äôs. New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman recounted Kushner once saying ‚Äî ‚ÄòBannon plays to my father-in-law‚Äôs worst instincts‚Äô. She, however, added that Trump will likely listen more to himself and probably appoint a replacement soon. ‚ÄúThere was a Steve Bannon before Steve Bannon ‚Ä¶ There has always been someone playing to Trump‚Äôs darker impulses. Before Bannon there was Roger Stone and before that Roy Cohn,‚Äù she said on NYT‚Äôs The Daily podcast.

Burnley sign Kiwi striker Chris Wood in club record deal,"Chris Wood has been signed by Burnley. (Source: Twitter) Chris Wood has been signed by Burnley. (Source: Twitter)

Burnley have signed striker Chris Wood from Leeds United on a four-year contract for a club record fee, the Premier League team announced on Monday. The New Zealand international striker, who scored 27 goals in the second tier Championship last season, is reported to have cost Burnley more than 15 million pounds ($19.3 million) plus additional payments. The club did not disclose the fee.

Burnley this month sold forward Andre Gray to Watford for a fee reported to be around 18 million pounds and Wood will likely compete with Wales international Sam Vokes for the central striker role in Sean Dyche‚Äôs team.

The 25-year-old target man joined Leeds from Leicester City in 2015, having also previously been at West Bromwich Albion. He scored 44 goals in 88 games for Leeds.

Although Wood was briefly part of Premier League squads at West Brom and Leicester, having helped both win promotion from the Championship, he says he is hungry for the chance to play more in the top tier.

‚ÄúMy ambition has been to play in the Premier League for years,‚Äù Wood told Burnley‚Äôs official website (www.burnleyfootballclub.com).

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had tastes of being in there but I‚Äôve never had the chance to give it a proper bash.

‚ÄúComing here I feel I‚Äôve got a proper opportunity to do that. I‚Äôve never started a Premier League game and this what I want to do.

Burnley were promoted back into the top flight in 2016 and finished 16th. They beat Chelsea away on the opening day of this campaign but lost 1-0 at home to West Brom on Saturday.

Wood, who played for New Zealand in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as an 18-year-old, has scored 20 goals in 52 appearances for the All Whites.

The deal is the fourth time that Burnley have broken their club record fee in the past year following the arrivals of Belgian Steven Defour and Irish pair Jeff Hendrick and Robbie Brady.

"US President Donald Trump administration had to put pressure on India for Afghan role, says UN envoy Nikki Haley","US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. (File/Photo) US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. (File/Photo)

US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said on Tuesday that the Trump administration had to put pressure on India to step up its role in bringing about a political solution to end the prolonged war in Afghanistan. Her comments came as Trump today unveiled his new Afghan strategy retracting from his initial instinct to pull out from Afghanistan. Instead, the US president said, the American troops will ‚Äúfight to win‚Äù the 16-year-long conflict. In a prime-time address, Trump called out Pakistan for for providing safe havens to terrorists but also said that India was making ‚Äúbillions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to put the pressure on India that they have to be part of the political solution,‚Äù Haley told CNN.

The Indian-origin US ambassador to the UN said that Trump was taking a regional approach to end the Afghan conflict.

‚ÄúThis is not just about Afghanistan. This is about the region, and so that means that we‚Äôve got to put the pressure on Pakistan,‚Äù she said, adding that Pakistan can no longer harbour safe havens for terrorists.

‚ÄúWe need to continue to let Iran know that all of this terrorism and their sponsorship of it is not something we‚Äôre going to put up with. And we need the international community to step up and say, look, if we‚Äôre going to do this, we‚Äôre doing it together. It‚Äôs not the US alone,‚Äù Haley said.

She said America‚Äôs enemies were no longer going to know ‚Äúwhat the timeline is‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat our enemies are going to know is, we‚Äôre not putting up with the terrorism anymore and we‚Äôre going to do whatever it takes,‚Äù she told the network.

Senator Ben Cardin, a ranking member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, supported Trump‚Äôs Afghan policy.

‚ÄúI think the president, is calling on regional cooperation. That is the right thing. We need to have Pakistan as a more cooperative partner in dealing with Afghanistan. India could be an important partner in dealing with this,‚Äù he told on MSNBC News.

‚ÄúWhat I find difficult to follow is what he‚Äôs doing on the military side. It looks like he is dealing another surge with additional troops being put into Afghanistan,‚Äù he said.

Cardin said the US needed a diplomatic surge. ‚ÄúThat, to me, is going to be the key, whether he can implement a surge and have the confidence of our regional partners that we can really bring peace to Afghanistan,‚Äù the Democratic Senator said.

Soul Strings: U Rajesh on the legacy of playing an Italian lute in the Carnatic classical system,"In the last three years, U Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound. In the last three years, U Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound.

Growing up in Palakal, Andhra Pradesh, U Rajesh never saw his older brother engage in sibling rivalry. ‚ÄúOr revelry,‚Äù says Rajesh, ‚ÄúHe was nine years older, would hardly talk or play and was always bent on a small fretboard, trying to figure something rest of us didn‚Äôt know. But I was a restive child, always wanting to go out to play, but he would never bother.‚Äù

In a telephone conversation from Chennai, Rajesh is referring to U Srinivas, better known to the world as Mandolin Srinivas, the famed musician who convinced the purists of the Carnatic classical world that an Italian lute, associated with court recitals in Europe, baroque concerti by Vivaldi and film music in India, could present the complexities of Carnatic music. Srinivas modified the instrument, using five single strings instead of the traditional four doubled strings and, in the process, the mandolin created gamakas, delivered nuances and gave pleasure to the rasikas as any other Indian classical instrument. Violin took decades to find that status in India. While the uninitiated enjoyed the novelty his music displayed, the connoisseurs loved the deft strokes, the technique, and the passion. So much so that when George Harrison stumbled upon Mandolin Ecstacy in the ‚Äô80s, a Srinivas album, he said in an interview, ‚ÄúEddie van Halen, eat your heart out‚Äù. Halen is one of the most distinguished guitarists in the history of rock music. Srinivas wasn‚Äôt in his twenties yet. His Carnatic career with the mandolin had just begun.

But Srinivas passed away in 2014 after a liver transplant failure. He was only 45, with a Padma Shri, a Sangeet Natak Akademi award and praises from Harrison and John Mclaughlin under his belt.

But, during the time he was alive, he taught Rajesh his unique style on the advice of Paramacharya of Kanchipuram. ‚ÄúI learnt some krithis. I always wanted to be a pilot. My brother said he‚Äôd help in that but, if I chose music, there would be no endorsements. ‚ÄòMy job will be to only teach you. No more,‚Äô he said. I was to take my pick,‚Äù recalls Rajesh, who did choose music, thinking he could go to his brother if there was a challenging situation. The two also played many duets. ‚ÄúAnd then, in a matter of just a month, he was gone. While performing, I still look to my right sometimes to get approval,‚Äù says 38-year-old Rajesh, who will be in Delhi on August 23 for a performance with sitar player Purbayan Chatterjee as a part of the 19th Amar Jyoti Concert presented by Pt Chaturlal Memorial Society. The organisation was formed in the memory of Pt Chaturlal, a fixture in Pt Ravi Shankar‚Äôs concerts abroad in the ‚Äô50s and one of the first Indian tabla players to introduce Indian percussion system to the West. Chaturlal died in 1965, at the age of 40. Ut Allah Rakha took over after that. The performance will be followed by a flute recital by Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia.

In the last three years, Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound. His collaboration with Chatterjee is also an endeavour in that direction. Apart from releasing Timeless, the last live recording of the kutcheri in Mylapore where he played with his brother, and performances at Chennai‚Äôs December season, he is actively collaborating ‚Äúto see how classical mandolin interacts with other Western instruments‚Äù. He‚Äôs already worked with Mclaughlin on Floating Point, which was nominated for a Grammy in 2009.

He will soon head to the US for his work with LA Philharmonic Orchestra. ‚ÄúThis exchange of notes widens my perspective of my own music. I‚Äôm trying to be my own musician, entangle myself with challenges, find answers myself,‚Äù says Rajesh.

Karun Nair anchors India A to six-wicket win over South Africa A,"Karun Nair scored 90 against South Africa A. (Source: PTI) Karun Nair scored 90 against South Africa A. (Source: PTI)

India A skipper Karun Nair led his side to a six-wicket win over South Africa A to level the two-matches series 1-1. Nair scored 90 runs as India A chased down a target of 224 runs at Senwes Park, Potchefstroom on the last day of the second unofficial four-day match.

Chasing the target, India lost Sudip Chatterjee for 18 after he was bowled by Dane Piedt. Shreyas Iyer too went back without making a substantial contribution as he was out caught and bowled by Shaun von Berg for 15.

After being reduced to 55/2, opener Ravikumar Samarth and skipper Nair stitched a partnership of 74 runs for the third wicket. Samarth continued his good form to score another half-century in the match. The right-hander was eventually undone by Piedt for 55.

Nair on the other side continued with his batting display and scored 93 runs for the fourth wicket with Ankit Bawne.

He was eventually out for 90 by Andile Phehlukwayo while Bawne remained unbeaten for 32. Hanuman Vihari, who replaced the captain in the middle, scored the winning runs after hitting a boundary off the only delivery he faced.

For South Africa it was Piedt who picked up two wickets while von Berg and Phehlukwayo scalped a wicket apiece. Earlier, in the second innings, India A rode on three-fors from Ankit Rajpoot and Shahbaz Nadeem to bundle out South Africa A for 177. Krishnappa Gowtham also chipped in with a couple of wickets.

India A scored 276 runs in first innings in reply to South Africa A‚Äôs 322. Stephen Cook scored 98 while Aiden Markram notched up 74 in first innings.

"Harmanpreet Kaur, Punam Raut and Diana Edulji will be guests at the Express Adda today","Diana Edulji (L) Harmanpreet Kaur (C) and Punam Raut (R) Diana Edulji (L) Harmanpreet Kaur (C) and Punam Raut (R)

AFTER DECADES of playing second fiddle to their male counterparts, the Indian women‚Äôs cricket team captured the nation‚Äôs imagination for three exhilarating weeks this July. Harmanpreet Kaur unleashed a breathtaking assault, scoring an unbeaten 171 off 115 balls against Australia in the semi-finals, and Punam Raut established herself as the bedrock of the top order, top-scoring in the final.

Kaur and Raut, along with former India captain-turned-administrator Diana Edulji, will be the guests at Express Adda in Mumbai on Tuesday.

Edulji was the only cricketer picked by the Supreme Court as a member of the Committee of Administrators (CoA) to run the Indian cricket board. With the CoA entrusted with implementing the Lodha panel reforms and engineering a change in the BCCI constitution, in line with the directions of the Supreme Court, the former all-rounder has a lot on her plate.

With captain Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami having announced that they have played their last World Cup, Kaur and Raut are the new faces of Indian women‚Äôs cricket.

Kaur‚Äôs innings against the six-time world champions is considered a seminal moment for Indian women‚Äôs cricket, with some comparing the knock with Kapil Dev‚Äôs 175 against Zimbabwe in the 1983 World Cup. Her strokeplay, poise and hitting ability are pointers to the direction the women‚Äôs game will take in the future.

Though the Indian women‚Äôs team reached the World Cup final in 2005 as well, that achievement did not make heads turn like their recent exploits in England. Already, there is some talk about starting a women‚Äôs IPL in the not-so-distant future.

Kaur, Raut and Edulji will be in conversation with The Indian Express Deputy Editor Seema Chishti and Assistant Editor Bharat Sundaresan.

The Express Adda is a series of informal interactions organised by The Indian Express Group and features people who have been at the centre of change. Guests at the event in the past include the Dalai Lama, economist and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, filmmaker Karan Johar, Union Minister Piyush Goyal, writer Amitav Ghosh and cricketer Virat Kohli.

German police apologise after officers taunt player in video,"Leipzig‚Äôs Timo Werner, right, and Schalke‚Äôs Thilo Kehrer challenge for the ball. (Source: AP) Leipzig‚Äôs Timo Werner, right, and Schalke‚Äôs Thilo Kehrer challenge for the ball. (Source: AP)

Police in the central German state of Hessen say they have opened disciplinary proceedings against officers in uniform who were filmed singing a disparaging song about Leipzig player Timo Werner.

Police say they were made aware of the YouTube video on Sunday, it appears to have been filmed in a changing room of the Hessian riot police, and ‚Äúthe officers‚Äô behavior is contrary to official principals.‚Äù

Werner, who played in Leipzig‚Äôs 2-0 Bundesliga loss at Schalke on Sunday, is unpopular among rival fans for earning a penalty with a blatant dive in the sides‚Äô clash last season.

The Hessen police say they ‚Äúexpressly disapprove of the officials‚Äô behavior,‚Äù and they have apologized to Leipzig general manager Ulrich Wolter. Wolter said he would pass the apology on to Werner.

"US Judge shot, wounded near Ohio courthouse; gunman killed","A judge walking from his car into the county courthouse was shot by a gunman but managed to fire back before a probation officer stepped in and ultimately killed the suspect, authorities said. Jefferson County Judge Joseph Bruzzese Jr. was shot today at around 8 am near the courthouse in Steubenville, just across the Ohio River from West Virginia‚Äôs northern panhandle, roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Pittsburgh. Courthouse video shows both the judge and the gunman firing about five times each, said Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla.

‚ÄúWhoever thought this could happen here?‚Äù Abdalla said, adding that investigators are familiar with the suspect and are checking to see if he had any connection with the judge. Steubenville City Manager James Mavromatis tells WTOV-TV that Bruzzese was talking after being wounded. He was flown to a Pittsburgh-area hospital.

Investigators didn‚Äôt immediately release further information about the judge‚Äôs condition or on the suspect. Republican Gov. John Kasich said he was told the judge would survive.

The attack had to be intentional because people know about the reserved spots where judges park, said one of Bruzzese‚Äôs judicial colleagues.

Judge Joseph Corabi said he and the county‚Äôs two other judges park in reserved spots next to the courthouse in eastern Ohio. Judges then walk a few feet down what‚Äôs known as ‚ÄúCourthouse Alley‚Äù to a side entrance to the building, said Corabi, the Jefferson County juvenile and probate court judge.

‚ÄúEverybody knows who parks there. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not an accident what happened. He was clearly an intended target,‚Äù Corabi said.

Corabi said Bruzzese is known as an avid hunter. He called him fair, hard-working, well-liked and ‚Äúa tough son of a gun.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is very intelligent and he can cut to the chase,‚Äù Corabi said. ‚ÄúHe spots issues and he resolves the issues.‚Äù Bruzzese, 65, hears general and domestic relations cases as one of two judges serving in Jefferson County Common Pleas Court.

Bruzzese has served on that court since 1997, according to Ohio Supreme Court records. He was most recently re-elected in 2014 for another six-year term.

Bruzzese had likely arrived early to review his usual Monday morning batch of legal motions, Corabi said.

Local media reported that the suspect‚Äôs body could be seen lying next to a car at the drive-thru of a neighboring bank. Police said a man who was in the car with him was taken into custody.

The courthouse was closed for the day as local and state authorities helped secure the scene. Jefferson County Commissioner Thomas Graham told WTOV that some courthouse workers witnessed the ‚Äútragic situation‚Äù and that people would need time to process what had happened.

The state crime lab will help investigate the shooting, said Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine.

The chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court called the attack a ‚Äúcowardly ambush‚Äù and urged court personnel √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù especially judges √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù to take extra precautions.

The attack ‚Äúreminds us all of the very real potential for violence against judges,‚Äù Maureen O‚ÄôConnor said. ‚ÄúViolence against judges represents an attack on the Rule of Law, the foundation of our country.‚Äù

(Source: Varinder Chawla) Manish Malhotra ended the Lakme Fashion Week W/F 2017 in style, with a bevvy of Bollywood beauties in the front row. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Celebrity designer Manish Malhotra ended the Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive in a spectacular way with film stars Jacqueline Fernandez and Aditya Roy Kapur as showstoppers. Titled ‚ÄòTales of Indulgence‚Äô, the grand finale saw a detailed use of black, white and chrome. While the menswear section saw a formal assortment, Malhotra chose to dress his women up in evening and cocktail dresses with handcrafted embellishments on them.

While Kapur looked dashing in a black, velvet one-button jacket with a contrast black embroidered lapels, Fernandez looked gorgeous in a long-sleeved, embroidered, net floor- skimming creation, over micro shorts.

Additionally, the front row of Malhotra‚Äôs show was filled with stars like Sridevi, who came along with her younger daughter Khushi, Shabana Azmi, Disha Patani, Richa Chadda, Dia Mirza, Karisma Kapoor, Amrita Rao Ladak, Sonali Bendre and Neha Dhupia, among others.

When at a Manish Malhotra show, the off-ramp fashion quotient is sometimes as high as on-ramp, and this time it was the same. Here are our favourite looks from the Bollywood line-up of beauties in the front row.

Sridevi, who recently turned a year younger was thrown a birthday party by the celebrated fashion designer and just she, just like the perfect best friend, turned up at his show to render her support. Not only that, the evergreen beauty looked gorgeous in an embellished white dress with silver fringes at the hemline by the designer himself. She left her beautiful black mane open and mid-parted. Accessorising with a simple silver clutch, she chose a pair of silver Christian Louboutin heels to go along with her attire.

Khushi Kapoor, Sridevi‚Äôs just as gorgeous daughter, looked stunning in strapless gown by Malhotra with an embellished bustier and a beautiful sheer skirt with floral embroidery towards the end. She styled her hair in a side-swept braid and kept her make-up minimal, except for the bright red lips which went well with her overall look.

Disha Patani, who has rarely disappointed with her sartorial choices, clearly must have turned up the temperatures in the front row of the show in her embellished three hued-dress with a plunging neckline. She chose to go for a smokey-eye make-up that complemented her look well and left her hair open and side swept. She wore dangling earcuffs and strappy sandals that teamed well with her outfit.

Karisma Kapoor too joined in the glitzy affair in a black and silver long sleeve dress from Malhotra‚Äôs cocktail collection. She chose to pair her outfit with black heels and kept her make-up fresh and minimal with just beautifully kohled-eyes. She chose to style her hair into a slight-puffed and raised pony-tail, looking gorgeous.

Amrita Arora decided to go for a bold and beautiful sheer number with pink floral appliques on it. She chose a pair of pumps that went well with her outfit, but we aren‚Äôt very sure about the golden clutch she held.

Diana Penty made us wish we could see her beautiful face in more films, as she made an appearance on the front row for the designer‚Äôs finale show. She looked beautiful in a collared shirt that she paired with a long silver skirt. While her outfit seemed simple, the hint of red added just the zing to her look.

Dia Mirza looked splendid in a silver long-sleeved dress with heavy embellishments. Otherwise seen wearing straight hair or soft curls, Mirza decided to go ‚Äòwild child‚Äô and styled her hair into a curly mane. She kept her make-up simple and teamed her outfit with a pair of silver sandals.

Neha Dhupia chose to go for a peach outfit and had a lot going on with ruffles and layering. While she layered her outfit with a peach jacket with long sleeves, the ruffles on her dress did not really add much value to her look. That, coupled with the boots she chose to wear with the dress only dampened her look.

Sonali Bendre made a warm appearance for Malhotra too, in a silver off-shoulder collar shirt that she paired with an embellished black long skirt from the designer‚Äôs collection. She left her hair open and mid-parted and chose to go for a deep red shade for her lips, looking just perfect for a cocktail gathering.

"For Indian wrestlers, it is mind over mat at World Championships","Sakshi Malik won bronze medal at the Rio Olympics. (File) Sakshi Malik won bronze medal at the Rio Olympics. (File)

The wrestling world championships begin in Paris on Monday. But no one‚Äôs talking about medals just yet. Instead, the Indian wrestlers ‚Äî women mainly ‚Äî obsess over Japan. They are the most dominant wrestling nation. To win gold, you‚Äôll have to beat a Japanese wrestler. And the Indians are in awe of them. Just as much as they fear them.

Sakshi Malik, who won the Olympic bronze exactly a year ago, feels it is ‚Äòtough to match Japanese wrestlers in this lifetime or next.‚Äô ‚ÄúWe would have to take rebirths in order to beat them. They are simply too good,‚Äù she had told PTI earlier this year. Vinesh Phogat said she would have to ‚Äòincrease her speed immensely‚Äô to even pose a threat to them.

Sakshi and Vinesh will have to wait till Thursday for their bouts. But you‚Äôd assume India‚Äôs best bets for a medal have already given up hope. An Indian woman wrestler has never beaten a Japanese opponent in a major international tournament. But the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) believes the problem is not on the mat. Instead, it‚Äôs in the wrestlers‚Äô minds. So, for the first time a psychologist is accompanying the team to a World Championship. And she has been given a very specific brief: prepare the woman wrestlers for the mental battle with the Japanese.

‚ÄúWe observed it during the Asian Championship. In terms of technique and tactics, we are as good as them. But such is the hype surrounding the Japanese wrestlers that we look defeated even before stepping on the mat,‚Äù WFI assistant secretary Vinod Tomar says. ‚ÄúThe players thought having a specialist would help them. So for the last couple of months, we have kept a full-time psychologist for the team, who is also with them in Paris.‚Äù

The anxiety on the faces of Indian wrestlers is apparent every time they come across their Japanese counterparts. During the Asian Championships in Delhi last May, head coach Kuldeep Malik called an impromptu team meeting after a training session at the KD Jadhav Stadium. But little attention was given to what was being said. Instead, their eyes were locked on the centre mat, where the Japanese team was training.

Such is their intensity that Japan‚Äôs training sessions, too, can be intimidating for other wrestlers. Aware that they are being watched, they indulged in some more showboating. Risako Kawai, a Rio Olympics gold medallist, lifted her coach and pinned him down thrice in 10 minutes as wide-eyed Indians stood motionless. That day and the next, four Indians reached finals in different weight categories. Three of them ‚Äì Sakshi, Vinesh Phogat and Divya Kakran ‚Äì lost to Japanese wrestlers. At the 2014 Asian Games and 2015 World Championships, too, Japanese wrestlers overpowered the Indians.

In Paris, depending on the draw, if Sakshi and Vinesh navigate past the early hurdles and reach the medal rounds, they are sure to meet a Japanese wrestler. For Sakshi, this will be the first global event in the 60kg category. She won the Olympic bronze in 58kg before jumping a category for the continental championship. During the same time, Kawai ‚Äì who won the gold at Rio in 63kg ‚Äì decided to drop her weight and compete in 60kg. They are the undisputed best in this category in Asia. But Kawai needed just two minutes and 44 seconds to beat Sakshi.

Vinesh, meanwhile, will face a tougher task. After winning the Asian championship silver medal in the 55kg, the youngest of the Phogat sisters has returned to her preferred 48kg category. But that has made her task of winning gold tougher. Japan‚Äôs Yui Susaki, the reigning Asian champion, has ruled this class. The teenage wonder kid, with three world cadet titles, has won all international tournaments in this category since making her senior debut.

Vinesh spoke about the speed of Japanese wrestlers after narrowly losing to Sae Nanjo at the Asian Championship. Susaki‚Äôs lightning quick movements will only enhance her apprehension. In an inexperienced squad, India will be banking on Vinesh and Sakshi for a podium finish. On the men‚Äôs side, Asian champion Bajrang Punia is the only hope. Bajrang, the 2013 bronze medallist, has the opportunity to become the first Indian wrestler to win two world championship medals. His task became marginally easy after the mass exodus in the 65kg category. The Rio Olympic finalists are absent while bronze medallists Frank Chamizo and Ikhtiyor Navruzov have moved to 70kg. It‚Äôs an open contest in this class and Bajrang will fancy his chances.

However, it won‚Äôt be straightforward for the women, who will have to put their mind over mat to stand a chance for a podium finish. Live on Star Sports 1st: 1pm

China installs high-definition cameras along Great Wall,"Beijing: Tourists at the Great Wall of China. China has installed over 300 high-definition cameras after growing incidents of vandalism, including by foreigners, who scratch their names or messages onto the masonry of the iconic wall.

(PTI Photo)

China has installed over 300 high-definition cameras along the iconic Great Wall after growing incidents of vandalism, including by foreigners, who scratch their names or messages onto the masonry of one of the world‚Äôs seven wonders.

The move is part of a two-pronged approach to tackle the problem which also involves teams patrolling the historic landmark to catch or warn off perpetrators, state-run China Radio International reported. It follows recent publicity after Chinese characters, along with English and Korean words were found on parts of the Great Wall‚Äôs popular Badaling section, causing a public outcry, it said. However, the practice is nothing new. NBA player, Bobby Brown, aroused public anger after scribbling his name and number on the Great Wall in October 2016, the report said.

An expert on the Great Wall, Dong Yaohui, says many of the scratches were left by tourists in the 1980s to 1990s when people were less aware of the importance of ancient monument protection, and preventative measures were far from effective.

The newly installed cameras will provide real-time monitoring and provide a record of events as evidence. If anyone is found to be vandalising the wall, they will be banned from visiting again, reported to the police and fined, the report said. Special teams will also patrol daily, with more frequent patrols during peak times. Special signs have been put up warning visitors against climbing on the wall or vandalising the brickwork.

The Great Wall, a symbol of China, is actually not just one wall, but many interconnected walls built between the third century B.C. and the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The existing sections are mainly the Ming wall, which stretches over 8,800 kms, inspiring wonder amongst its millions of visitors each year. ‚ÄúIt is a marvellous sight. I wonder how this massive structure was built in the olden times,‚Äù said Sunil Kumar, an Indian visitor to the Wall, considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

It was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987. With a total length of more than 21,000 kms (the entire wall with all of its branches), China‚Äôs Great Wall runs through 404 counties in 15 provincial regions, with much of it in poor condition due to natural erosion and man-made damage. The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. It was mainly constructed to thwart foreign invasions.

Last year, the Chinese government allocated 700 million yuan (over USD 100 million) to protect the Great Wall over the past two years, according to a top cultural heritage official. Liu Yuzhu, director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH), said that this year his department aims to set up model zones for protection, launch training programmes for protectors and volunteers and establish a national research center for Great Wall protection.

Plurality protects,"Muslim women celebrating Supreme Court‚Äôs verdict on triple talaq. (Express photo by Vishal) Muslim women celebrating Supreme Court‚Äôs verdict on triple talaq. (Express photo by Vishal)

In the history of the Indian Supreme Court, when multi-member benches have decided issues of national or constitutional importance, plurality of opinions is not uncommon, and what the court comes to hold finally on an issue, depends on what the majority of judges say on that specific issue. It is also not uncommon for a particular judge to agree with one set of judges on one issue and another set of judges on an another. Most notable amongst such decisions was the opinion of Justice H.R. Khanna in the 13-judge bench decision in Kesavananda Bharati (1973). Justice Khanna, while agreeing with one set of judges that the power of Parliament to amend is plenary, held that the word amendment itself has inherent and implicit restrictions and thus cannot be used to amend the basic structure of the Constitution, thus agreeing with other six judges and forming a majority that led to the introduction of the ‚Äúbasic structure‚Äù doctrine.

The plurality of opinions rendered by five judges of the constitution bench has, in effect, ensured that the agency and rights of Muslim women are protected but at the same time the rights of Muslim minorities with respect to their personal law is not subjected to undesirable and motivated attacks. It is a big victory for Muslim women and Muslim women‚Äôs movements who have been fighting to set aside this practice. Most Muslim women‚Äôs movements have anchored their opposition to triple talaq on the fact that this practice is un-Quranic and, therefore, considered their challenge as an attempt to reform personal law, rather than efface it. The plurality of opinions rendered by the SC, when read together, do exactly that. The range of arguments put forth in court, from which this plurality arises, indicate a healthy and lively discussion amongst the Muslim community on the issue of talaq-i-bidat.

The order of the court signed by the five judges says: ‚ÄúIn view of the different opinions recorded, by a majority of 3:2 the practice of ‚Äòtalaq-e-bidat‚Äô ‚Äî triple talaq is set aside.‚Äù It is important to note that the majority decision is only to set aside talaq-i-bidat and not to set it aside as unconstitutional. This is because only Justice Nariman and Justice Lalit ‚Äî two of the five judges ‚Äî have held the practice to be arbitrary and therefore violative of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. The third judge who agrees to set aside the practice seeks to do so on completely different grounds. Justice Joseph holds that after the introduction of Section 2 of the Shariat Application Act, 1937, which made Muslim personal law (shariat) as the ‚Äúrule of decision‚Äù where the parties were Muslims, ‚Äúno practice against the tenets of Quran are permissible‚Äù and talaq-i-bidat, which is not permitted by the Quran is not part of shariat and consequently not applicable to Muslims in India.

Thus, while three judges agreed to set-aside the practice of talaq-i-bidat, they have chosen to do so on very different sets of reasons. This departure of Justice Joseph becomes extremely consequential, in light of his other finding that ‚ÄúIn that view of the matter, I wholly agree with the learned Chief Justice that the 1937 Act is not a legislation regulating talaq. Consequently, I respectfully disagree with the stand taken by Nariman, J. that the 1937 Act is a legislation regulating triple talaq and hence, the same can be tested on the anvil of Article 14.‚Äù

The net effect of this finding is that Justice Joseph agrees with the other two-judges ‚Äî CJ Khehar and Justice Nazeer ‚Äî that Muslim personal law, as applicable through the Shariat Application Act is personal law and not statutory law, and is not subject to being tested on the anvil of fundamental rights. Currently, most rules of sharia apply to Indian Muslims through the route of Act and thus, the Constitution Bench by a 3:2 majority has also held that Muslim personal law is not subject to the fundamental rights chapter of the Constitution. Justice Joseph straddles both these majorities, siding with two judges on setting aside the practice of talaq-i-bidat while siding with two others in effectively holding that most personal law that applies to Indian Muslims is beyond a constitutional challenge.

One of the reasons why three judges have come to this conclusion is evident from the observation in CJ Khehar‚Äôs judgment, where he holds that ‚ÄúSuch a call of conscience, as the petitioners desire us to accept, may well have a cascading effect. We say so, because the contention of the learned Attorney General was, that ‚Äòtalaq-e-ahsan‚Äô and ‚Äòtalaq-e-hasan‚Äô were also liable to be declared unconstitutional, for the same reasons as have been expressed with reference to ‚Äòtalaq-e-bidat‚Äô. The practices of ‚Äòpolygamy‚Äô and ‚Äòhalala‚Äô amongst Muslims are already under challenge before us. It is not difficult to comprehend, what kind of challenges would be raised by rationalists, assailing practices of different faiths on diverse grounds, based on all kinds of enlightened sensibilities. We have to be guarded, lest we find our conscience traversing into every nook and corner of religious practice.‚Äù Thus, the court was concerned that if personal law is allowed to be challenged on constitutional grounds, it would open a Pandora‚Äôs box of vested challenges that would completely efface personal law.

The net effect of the judgment is that while the practice of talaq-i-bidat is gone, any future change in Muslim personal law as it presently applies will have to come from Parliament and not from constitutional challenges. This is also what CJ Khehar‚Äôs opinion recommends. A comprehensive legislation of Muslim personal law ‚Äî as opposed to a uniform civil code ‚Äî taking into account the global developments in Muslim personal law and the social realities of Indian Muslims today, after a detailed discussion with all stakeholders is the way forward. That is the space for the Muslim women‚Äôs movement to engage with next.

UK looking to stop ‚Äòmalicious‚Äô use of rented vehicles after Spain attacks,"Police officers stand at a road block at the beginning of fiestas in Bilbao, Spain August 19, 2017, after a van ran down pedestrians in Barcelona‚Äôs Las Ramblas on Thursday. Police officers stand at a road block at the beginning of fiestas in Bilbao, Spain August 19, 2017, after a van ran down pedestrians in Barcelona‚Äôs Las Ramblas on Thursday.

Britain is exploring ways of stopping the ‚Äúmalicious‚Äù use of hired vehicles, including looking at what more rental companies can do, the transport ministry said on Sunday, after two attacks in Spain killed 14 people. The attacks ‚Äì one in Barcelona where a van was driven into crowds, killing 13 people, and another in Cambrils that saw five men drive a vehicle along a walkway, killing a woman ‚Äì echoed tactics that have been used by Islamist militants in London.

The police say that the use of hired vehicles makes such attacks very hard to prevent. ‚ÄúThe threat from terrorism is changing and so must our response. That is why we are reviewing our counter-terrorism strategy and powers and why we have ploughed extra resources into counter-terrorism,‚Äù a government spokesperson said.

‚ÄúThe Department for Transport is also working with the police and the vehicle rental industry to explore what more can be done to prevent the malicious use of hire vehicles. This includes looking at what more rental companies could do before an individual can hire a vehicle.‚Äù Britain has increased the number of barriers at bridges and in certain locations in city centres to try to prevent such attacks. Since March, Britain has seen four attacks, three involving a vehicle deliberately driven at pedestrians.

British hire firms make various checks before granting a vehicle rental, including verifying that customers have a full driving licence, additional identification and a valid credit card. Similarly, Italy‚Äôs Interior Ministry over the weekend instructed its local officials to begin to track truck rentals. The ministry wants each heavy vehicle hire to be communicated to local police.

Pay to stay behind bars! Thailand has a new prison-themed hotel,"The owner of the hotel was inspired by the iconic Hollywood film, ‚ÄòThe Shawshank Redemption‚Äô. The owner of the hotel was inspired by the iconic Hollywood film, ‚ÄòThe Shawshank Redemption‚Äô.

People may love the luxuries of a five-star hotel but for those who like it edgy and different, there‚Äôs a lot more fun in staying at some of the world‚Äôs weirdest hotels. So, though as a (hopefully) law-abiding person, it‚Äôs (thankfully) unlikely that you‚Äôll ever know what the inside of a prison would look like, an entrepreneur in Thailand figured why not create that as an experience for those with a curious mind.

Joining the genre of weird hotels such as the ‚Äúcorpse hotels‚Äù in Japan or like the Hotel La Claustra in Switzerland, where people spend their time in a former army bunker, is the Sook Station in Bangkok, which just opened earlier this summer and offers guests the opportunity to spend a night behind bars (quite literally). Designed to mimic jail, enthusiasts can now spend the night in a prison cell for around 1,300 Thai Baht (¬£30 or Rs2,500) per night, and have a first-hand experience of a Thai prison cell.

The prison-inspired hotel treats its guest well but all perks are styled to suit what a prisoner would otherwise face.

The rooms have metal gates with rods, bunk beds, common toilets and light-out curfew. The guests, rather inmates are given black and white striped clothes and a mug shot is taken on arrival. The compound is also secured with barbed wires, giving off the vibes of a correctional home. Apart from small cells measuring just 8 sqm, there are larger family cells too.

Located at Bang Na district of Bangkok, just 15km away from Suvarnabhumi Airport, it has become quite a hit among tourists. Here, the guests are not given keys to their rooms but receive an inmate number, which can be used as room codes and are given a criminal record as a memento.

Sook Station that translates to ‚Äúhappiness station‚Äù in English does come with a few luxuries that inmates wouldn‚Äôt find in a jail. From free Wi-Fi and car parking to delicious food served at its restaurant, this unique theme hotel is not that gloomy.

And if one is too tired of the dim lighting and iron gates, there are rooms with a balcony too. The hotel also offers an outdoor Jacuzzi, a relaxation lounge, office space and halls to host events. The terrace is the perfect place to even have a romantic date with fairy lights. It also has a 24-hour coffee shop that too follows the prison theme.

Inspired by the iconic Hollywood film, The Shawshank Redemption, the owner told the Lonely Planet that most of the guests like it because it is unique and comfortable.

But this is not the first prison-themed hotel. Karostas Cietums is a military prison in Latvia that housed enemies and revolutionaries during Stalin‚Äôs time that opened in 1905. Now turned into a hotel that is just open for overnight stays, visitors can experience the harsh prison life. And if the severe condition is not preferred, then one can experience luxuries at other prison-turned-resorts. While there is hotel Het Arresthuis (Dutch for house arrest) outside Amsterdam, a 90-year-old prison in Istanbul is now a posh Four Seasons hotel. And luxurious Liberty Hotel in Boston is also a former prison.

Florida shooting: Suspect in killings of two police officers arrested at bar,"Two law enforcement officers stand guard outside Osceola Regional Medical Center after two Kissimmee police officers were shot Friday, Aug. 18, 2017, in Kissimmee, Florida. (AP) Two law enforcement officers stand guard outside Osceola Regional Medical Center after two Kissimmee police officers were shot Friday, Aug. 18, 2017, in Kissimmee, Florida. (AP)

A police officer in Florida died from his injuries Saturday, a day after his colleague was killed when a suspect fired at them during a scuffle while they were on patrol. The suspect was later arrested at a bar.

Sgt. Sam Howard died Saturday afternoon at a hospital where he had been taken following Friday night‚Äôs attack in Kissimmee, Florida, located south of the theme park hub of Orlando. Officer Matthew Baxter died Friday night, a short time after authorities say he was shot by 45-year-old Everett Miller. Miller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Baxter. Authorities hadn‚Äôt yet said what charges he could face for Howard‚Äôs death.

During a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was ‚Äúchecking out‚Äù three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O‚ÄôDell. The officers didn‚Äôt have an opportunity to return fire. They weren‚Äôt wearing body cameras.

Sheriff‚Äôs deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O‚ÄôDell said. They found a handgun and revolver on him. ‚ÄúThey were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,‚Äù O‚ÄôDell said.

The police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter‚Äôs handcuffs. Authorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.

Miller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff‚Äôs Office. The early stages of the investigation show that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O‚ÄôDell said.

Baxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children. Howard, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O‚ÄôDell said. ‚ÄúThey are two wonderful men, family men,‚Äù O‚ÄôDell said. ‚ÄúThey are two committed to doing it the right way.‚Äù

Separately, two other officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where the mother of the man‚Äôs child, their 19-month-old toddler, the woman‚Äôs mother and a family friend were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.

Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Saturday that officers Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell are in stable condition following Friday night‚Äôs confrontation with an armed Derrick Brabham, who was killed by the officers. In Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night. In a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, a suspect was fatally shot and an officer injured after they got into a struggle.

President Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. ‚ÄúWe are with you!‚Äù he said. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted he was ‚Äúheartbroken‚Äù by the attacks on the officers. US Rep. Darren Soto said Saturday that he will ask for American flags to be flown over the U.S. Capitol and he plans to ask for a moment of silence on the floor of the U.S. House to honor the officers.

The officers were fatally shot in a district where the top prosecutor says she will no longer seek the death penalty. State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced earlier this year that she wouldn‚Äôt seek the death penalty, explaining it‚Äôs not a deterrent and it drags on for years for the victims‚Äô relatives. The announcement came as her office was building a case against Markeith Loyd, who is charged with the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police lieutenant.

Gov. Rick Scott on Saturday evening issued an executive order removing the case from Ayala and reassigning it. ‚ÄúToday, I am using my executive authority to reassign this case to State Attorney Brad King to ensure the victims of last night‚Äôs attack and their families receive the justice they deserve,‚Äù Scott said in the order. A spokeswoman for Ayala didn‚Äôt respond to an email inquiry seeking comment.

South Korean arrested for duping Thais into sex trade,"A South Korean man accused of duping over 20 Thai women into forced prostitution in his home country has been arrested in Bangkok, an officer said today.A South Korean man accused of duping over 20 Thai women into forced prostitution in his home country has been arrested in Bangkok, an officer said on Saturday.

Kim Hyoung Joon, 39, is believed to be part of a transnational gang funnelling Thai women into the sex trade in South Korea, and his arrest follows efforts by Bangkok and Seoul to dismantle the group.

Thai police said Joon promised women jobs as masseuses in South Korea. But upon their arrival they were instead forced into sex work by pimps who seized their passports and blocked any attempts at escape. ‚ÄúMore than 20 women have been lured by this gang over the past two to three years,‚Äù said Songsak Raksaksakul, the deputy director of Thailand‚Äôs Department of Special Investigations (DSI). ‚ÄúMost of the victims are between 25 and 40 years old,‚Äù he added.

Joon was arrested at his Bangkok apartment on Thursday and charged with human trafficking. Thai and South Korean authorities are coordinating to track down a woman who they believe was Joon‚Äôs Thai accomplice and has fled to a neighbouring country.

In February, South Korean police arrested eight other suspects and rescued several Thai victims. Thailand is a notorious source, destination and transit hub for human trafficking operations that shift vulnerable women, men and children into sex work and other forms of forced labour.

In May, US authorities charged 21 people, including 10 Thai nationals, for running an international criminal enterprise that trafficked hundreds of Thai women into brothels across America.

Former England manager Steve McClaren takes up Tel Aviv coaching role,"Steve McClaren also previously managed Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United. (Source: AP/File) Steve McClaren also previously managed Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United. (Source: AP/File)

Former England manager Steve McClaren has agreed to join Israel‚Äôs Maccabi Tel Aviv as a coaching consultant to new manager Jordi Cruyff, the Israeli Premier League club said on Monday.

McClaren coached England for 16 months from 2006 before being sacked following the team‚Äôs failure to qualify for the 2008 European Championships. He also previously managed Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United.

‚ÄúI have huge respect for such a well known club both in Israel and in Europe and I intend to help Jordi and the players achieve success for the fans this season,‚Äù McClaren told Tel Aviv‚Äôs website (www.maccabi-tlv.co.il).

The 56-year-old previously worked with Cruyff at Manchester United where McClaren was assistant manager under Alex Ferguson from 1999-2001 while Cruyff played for the Premier League club.

McClaren also coached Dutch side FC Twente in two separate spells from 2008-10, leading them to the Dutch league title in 2010, and from 2012-13, where he resigned after a year due to poor performances that led to widespread criticism from fans.

West Indies‚Äô Kraigg Brathwaite reported for suspect bowling action,"Kraigg Brathwaite remains free to bowl in international cricket. (Source: AP) Kraigg Brathwaite remains free to bowl in international cricket. (Source: AP)

The International Cricket Council on Sunday revealed that West Indies all-rounder Kraigg Brathwaite has been reported for a suspect bowling action. This happened during the first Test, which was a day-night affair, between England and West Indies at Edgbaston. West Indies suffered a loss by an innings and 209 runs against England and Brathwaite bowled six overs in the England innings. In his six overs he gave away six runs. The match finished inside three days.

‚ÄúThe match officials‚Äô report, which was handed over to the Windies‚Äô team management, cited concerns about the legality of the 24-year-old‚Äôs bowling action,‚Äù said an International Cricket Council (ICC) statement issued on Sunday.

The report won‚Äôt stop Brathwaite from bowling in international cricket until the result of the test that will be performed on his action. The test will be performed within next 14 days. England and West Indies play the second Test of the three-match series at Headingly starting Friday and he is free to bowl in that Test match.

While Brathwaite opens the batting for West Indies and they will need him more for that, he has taken 12 wickets in his 38 Tests which also includes a six-wicket haul for 29 runs against Sri Lanka in Colombo in October 2015.

Kareena-Karisma are back at twinning in pastel midis and we can‚Äôt keep calm,"Kareena Kapoor Khan (R) and Karisma Kapoor acing their twinning game.

The Kapoor sisters as Soha Ali Khan puts it, are the ‚Äúqueens of the fashion police‚Äù. We might not completely agree with her judgement but there‚Äôs no denying that they are one of the most fashionable sister duos in Bollywood. The siblings have their unique sense of style which ‚Äì on most occasions ‚Äì is inspiring, and all the more worth following because they seem to have fun while dressing up. If you haven‚Äôt noticed, an important part of their life is twinning and looks like they have been doing it since their growing up days! Look at this photo where they are seen wearing matching outfits, so why should things change now?

Recently, for a photo shoot, the siblings picked up pastel midis. Karisma shared a couple of photos on Instagram from behind the shoot and a boomerang too! They look radiant and while, Kareena Kapoor Khan chose a boat-neck pink dress with ruffled sleeves, elder sister Karisma Kapoor flaunted her slender figure in a beautiful cold-shoulder grey number.

Now, both the dresses are pretty and we like how Kareena wore it with a wavy, high ponytail and minimal make-up but we feel Karisma styled it better with metallic silver heels, natural make-up and simple blow-dry hair.

Prior to this, they were seen twinning at Soha Ali Khan‚Äôs baby shower in military green jackets with white stars all over it from Sincerely Jules.

The duo paired it with simple denims and white tees and rounded out the look with casual updos, swanky handbags and sunglasses. Talk about taking basics to the next level! We loved it.

What about you? Do you like their twinning game? Let us know in the comments below.

"Bawana by-election: BJP says the vote will be for Delhi, and for PM Modi","Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PTI Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PTI Photo)

On Sunday, a sea of orange greeted residents at Bawana as the BJP put all its weight to woo voters ‚Äî with padyatras, door-to-door campaigns and large sabhas ‚Äî on the last weekend before the Bawana bypoll. BJP heavyweights MP Udit Raj, Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari and Haryana cabinet minister Captain Abhimanyu were among those who arrived to campaign at Bawana on Sunday, which the party statement described as a ‚Äúmore intense campaign‚Äù.

The stakes for the BJP are clear ‚Äî it hopes to build on the momentum from the MCD poll victory and take a small step towards countering AAP‚Äôs brute majority in the assembly by winning Bawana. Their campaign strategy, party leaders explained, was to focus on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

At the tehsil ground in Auchandi on Sunday, saffron flags and caps dominated as residents gathered for the BJP‚Äôs sabha. One after the other, party leaders spoke about how the elections were a matter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs ‚Äúaan, baan, shaan‚Äù and attacked the AAP government. Captain Abhimanyu said, ‚ÄúPeople of Delhi are watching closely whether the path chosen at Rajouri Garden would be followed in Bawana. Don‚Äôt waste your votes, they determine your destiny, and Bawana‚Äôs votes will determine the destiny of Delhi.‚Äù District BJP President Neeldaman Khatri added, ‚ÄúYe chunav sirf ek vidhan sabha ka nahi hai; ye chunav poori Dilli ke faisla ka hai.‚Äù

Reiterating that this was an election of Modi‚Äôs ‚Äúaan baan shaan‚Äù, SDMC Mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat, said, ‚ÄúThis is an election between those who believe that ‚Äòdesh ke tukde honge Insha Allah‚Äô and those who have given everything for the country.

Make your choice.‚Äù Jat leader Chand Ram also said the bypoll was a matter of the PM‚Äôs pride, ‚ÄúIf we lose this seat, people will say Modiji could not win one seat. The media will question whether his magic is over. We cannot allow this,‚Äù he said, as people cheered in unison. For many in the audience, too, the elections were more about Modi than local issues. ‚ÄúHe is doing good work for our country, he should be given a chance,‚Äù said Nandlal, a supporter.

"WWE Raw Results: Roman Reigns, John Cena form alliance","WWE Raw following SummerSlam saw John Cena shift to the red brand. (Source: WWE) WWE Raw following SummerSlam saw John Cena shift to the red brand. (Source: WWE)

In his first WWE Raw appearance in over a year, John Cena found an ally ‚Äì an unlikely buddy ‚Äì in Roman Reigns and the duo came together to get the better of Samoa Joe and The Miz in an incredible Raw main event following an extremely physical WWE SummerSlam event on Sunday night. The Monday night event at the same venue in New York was also a stage to more Brock Lesnar and Braun Strowman brutality. The massive Strowman continued his physical assault on Lesnar ‚Äì not a small feat by any stretch of imagination ‚Äì and set on course a huge WWE Universal Championship match at No Mercy.

WWE Raw General Manager Kurt Angle had been promising a big-name Superstar to come to the red brand and the name couldn‚Äôt have been bigger than John Cena. The Superstar walked in as a free agent and made his intentions clear ‚Äì he wanted to go at Reigns following their numerous multi-athlete matches and Twitter spats. He wanted a one-on-one. But before his wishes could be filled, The Miz‚Äôs music blared and he questioned why the two were afforded marquee moments at his expense.

But what happened next came as a surprise to one and all. Instead of a possible, and likely, The Miz vs John Cena clash, Cena offered a team-up with Reigns to take on The Miz and any of his Miztourage members. But as it turned out, Samoa Joe threw his hat in the ring and made his presence felt immediately with a surprise punch to Cena to welcome him to the brand. What followed was a brawl from which Cena and Reigns came out safely.

In the main event of the night, things didn‚Äôt go The Miz‚Äôs way of getting a winning end. In fact, he became the pinned Superstar in the tag team match despite the uneasy alliance between Cena and Reigns. Cena, meanwhile, applied the Attitude Adjustment when The Miz took too long for his finishing move of Skull-Crushing Finale.

"Mercy, My Jewels!","Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‚ÄòMona Lisa of the North‚Äô, by Johannes Vermeer Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‚ÄòMona Lisa of the North‚Äô, by Johannes Vermeer

Book- The Ring of Truth: Myths of Sex and Jewelry

Author- Wendy Doniger

Publication- Speaking Tiger

Pages- 397

Price- Rs 899

Wendy Doniger‚Äôs latest book, The Ring of Truth, has 45 pages of notes and a 30-page index. Yet, it is so much more than a well-annotated and minutely referenced compendium of stories about rings, lost and found, about how jewelry can establish the identity of a person or jog a buried memory of love. In Doniger‚Äôs agile mind and in her skilful hands, these become stories, as the very clever pun in the title suggests, about truth and reality, about how memory, recognition and human consciousness work for the self and for the other.

The stories in the book come from many genres, cultures and languages, but the paradigmatic story here is Kalidasa‚Äôs Shakuntala ‚Äî a story about an innocent forest girl who loses the ring of recognition that the king, her ‚Äòhusband,‚Äô gives her and then is denied physical as well as psychic recognition on account of its absence. When Dushyanta sees the ring many years later, he remembers his lost love and travels through the three worlds to find her and the son that she bore him. The child he encounters is proved to be his son through another piece of jewelry, a band that he wears on his arm. Eventually, all memories are restored, everyone is proved to be who they said they were and the family is reunited in love and happiness. A crucial character in this story is the fish who swallowed the ring that went missing ‚Äì the fish, too, becomes a motif in the ocean of stories that Doniger draws upon.

Doniger takes the many strands of Kalidasa‚Äôs story and weaves them into other stories from around the world, indicating how they are alike or different from each other. But, unlike so many other gatherers of tales that resemble each other (Stith Thompson and Alan Dundes, for example), Doniger does not care about a mere taxonomy. Her interest lies not in what these stories tell us about themselves and each other, but what they tell us about ourselves ‚Äî how we think, how we feel, how we construct reality, how we love those that we do and what it is, both within and without ourselves, that is lost when we lose our lovers and our memories.

Although she never leaves the world of classical mythology behind, as the sutradhar who holds the thread of rings and memory, Doniger takes us on a whirlwind tour of narratives from opera, works from 19th and 20th century literature, many contemporary works of fiction as well as to her other great love, the movies. In this volume, we get (re)acquainted with the Celtic fairy Morgana, Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Isolde, Siegfried and Brunhilde, various Shakespeare plays and a host of other lovers who are separated from each other, who cheat on each other in moments of ring-induced forgetfulness, who use rings and other personal objects to reveal their true identities or to unmask imposters.

There is also a fascinatingly detailed chapter about Marie Antoinette‚Äôs diamond necklace, a rather large, heavy and expensive piece of jewelry which, though entirely non-existent, took the allegedly extravagant and heartless queen to the guillotine. Reminding us that even in the real world, a piece of jewelry can be a potent symbol, a metonym, in fact, for a person, Doniger traces the story of this necklace-that-never-was through various historical sources. The factually verifiable version that Doniger produces of the queens and knaves, the kings and priests, the cuckolds and mistresses that animate the saga of the necklace would put Alexander Dumas to shame. Later in the book, a corollary to this chapter about the Queen‚Äôs Necklace is a thoroughly enjoyable, wise and witty takedown of De Beers, the company that markets diamonds as ‚Äòsymbols, myths, magic.‚Äô (p.259)

Doniger tells us that The Ring of Truth actually split off from an earlier book for which she was collecting stories (The Woman who Pretended to be Who She Was, 2004). And, so it is that this book about rings of truth stays with many of Doniger‚Äôs favourite themes and recurrent concerns, such as sexual masquerade and substitution. Although she often refers to conventional Freudian readings of myth about real and imagined sexual encounters, Doniger is not afraid to call some of these encounters between men and beguiled (and most often, helpless) women ‚Äòrape,‚Äô for that is what they more correctly are. By analysing whatever devices of enchantment (curses, disguises, amnesia, darkness, fog) these stories use, she brings the essential nature of the pivotal sexual encounter to our attention. This persuades us to recognise how violence ‚Äî emotional, physical and sexual ‚Äî against women is prevalent in all cultures, hard-wired, as it is, into the stories that human beings love to tell over and over again.

Having said that, this is hardly the point of the book, which is anything but a feminist polemic against telling stories about women who lose their rings and are forgotten (or sometimes, ‚Äòmisremembered‚Äô) by their lovers. Rather, it is a book that revels precisely in these stories and the myriad ways in which we tell them. While the stories are often about sexual violence, they are even more about the cognitive violence inflicted upon the self and the other by forgetting or by the wilful erasure of memory. At a time when the danger of systematic cognitive violence against truth and memory is all too real, it is comforting to read a book which reminds you that memories can be restored, that truth can return, to heal both life and love.

"We, the People: Sketching illustrations for the Constitution of India","A total of 22 illustrations were designed for the Constitution of India. (Source: Express Archive Photo) A total of 22 illustrations were designed for the Constitution of India. (Source: Express Archive Photo)

While the founding fathers of the Constitution were framing the laws that would govern India, miles from the capital, Delhi, Nandalal Bose and his students in Santiniketan were sketching illustrations that would feature in the manuscript, and would encapsulate India‚Äôs rich history, diversity and unity. It was Jawaharlal Nehru who had reportedly proposed that Bose work on the Constitution of India, where the text, too, was handwritten by calligrapher Prem Behari Narain Raizada in flowing italic.

For the world‚Äôs longest written Constitution ‚Äî now carefully kept in the library of the Parliament of India ‚Äî Bose and his team designed a total of 22 illustrations. Borrowing from Indian miniature tradition, Ajanta frescoes and what came to be defined as the Santiniketan style, intricate frames surround the text. The depictions span different periods. If the initial part has the popular Indus Valley seal mark, the Zebu bull, the Vedic period is represented by a scene from gurukul. We see scenes from various eras, including the Mauryan and Mughal empire, and the dancing Nataraja from the Chola tradition. The freedom movement is portrayed with a figure of Mahatma Gandhi during the Dandi March, and another frame has Subhash Chandra Bose.

Our epics find representation, too. From the Ramayana, there is Ram, Lakshman and Sita returning home; a scene from the Mahabharata has Krishna and Arjun in conversation. Buddha and Mahavira are also part of the Constitution, where the varied geographical terrain of India is also celebrated.

Sharad Yadav-led Opposition panel to hold meetings in all states,"New Delhi: JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav (PTI Photo) New Delhi: JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav (PTI Photo)

Senior JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, who has opposed Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar‚Äôs decision to align with the BJP, was on Monday made convenor of a 16-member Opposition committee that will hold conventions on the theme of ‚ÄúSave Composite Culture‚Äù in all states on the lines of the August 17 event here. Gujarat JD(U) MLA Chhotubhai Basava, who had gone against his party‚Äôs decision to support the BJP and voted for Congress candidate Ahmed Patel in the recent Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat, has also been made a member of the committee.

In what seemed a precursor to plans to forge a larger Opposition unity ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the ‚ÄúSajha Virasat Bachao Sammelan‚Äù held here on August 17 saw Opposition parties tearing into the Narendra Modi-led government‚Äôs programmes and vowing to fight it under a united banner. It was proposed that to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the nation‚Äôs composite culture in consonance with the Preamble to the Constitution, committees at the state level and one committee at the national level may be formed.

Members of the national committee formed on Monday include Anand Sharma (Congress), Ramgopal Yadav (SP), Veer Singh (BSP), Sitaram Yechury (CPM), Sukhendu Sekhar Roy (TMC), former Jharkhand CMs Babulal Marandi (JVM-P) and Hemant Soren (JMM), Tariq Anwar (NCP), D Raja (CPI), Jayant Chaudhary (RLD), Manoj Jha (RJD), B R Ambedkar‚Äôs grandson Prakash Ambedkar (Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh), Danish Ali (JDS) and suspended JD(U) leader and former minister Ramai Ram.

A decision was taken to hold such conventions in various states soon, for which state-level panels may be formed. Sharad becoming convenor of the panel is further indication that there is little scope for reconciliation between him and Nitish, who had on Saturday dared him to break the party if he had the support of MLAs and MPs.

Stopping short of suspending him from the party, the JD(U) has already removed Sharad from the post of leader of the House in Rajya Sabha and threatened further measures including termination of his Rajya Sabha membership if he attends the ‚ÄúBJP bhagao, desh bachao‚Äù rally being organised by Lalu Prasad‚Äôs RJD on August 27.

Meanwhile, sources close to Sharad said they would soon approach the Election Commission to claim that the ‚Äúreal JD(U)‚Äù belongs to them. Sharad had talks in this regard on Sunday with Congress leader and senior lawyer Kapil Sibal. Sibal and two of his juniors met Sharad at his residence Saturday. The Sharad camp is likely to question election of Nitish as JD(U) president in April 2016.

India vs Sri Lanka: Angry Sri Lanka fans hold up team bus,"India humbled Sri Lanka by 9 wickets in the first ODI in Dambulla. (Source: PTI) India humbled Sri Lanka by 9 wickets in the first ODI in Dambulla. (Source: PTI)

A small section of Sri Lanka fans expressed their displeasure and made their disappointment with the team known at Dambulla following the 9 wicket trouncing at India‚Äôs hands in the first of five match ODI series.

Reportedly, a group of nearly 50 fans stood in the vicinity of the Sri Lankan bus and shouted slogans. They only dispersed from the area and the parked location after police intervened and cleared the spot. This delayed the team‚Äôs departure from the venue by half an hour.

The recent protestations from the fans come following months of disappointing performances by the 1996 World Cup winning Sri Lanka. The team has been tormented by numerous on-field poor performances with no real substitute appearing for Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene.

If the fans have not shown their annoyance with the team‚Äôs play in the stands, it has come loud and clear on social media with multiple memes and satirical digs at the team, selectors and administrators.

In recent memory, Sri Lanka crashed out of the ICC Champions Trophy in group stages following a harrowing fielding display; lost ODI series to 11th ranked Zimbabwe and then just about beat them in a one-off Test match. Now in the on-going series against India, they were demolished 0-3 in the three match Test series and started off with a nine wicket defeat in the first ODI.

Aware of the decline in popularity of the national side, former and current players have asked for fans to stick by the side. ‚ÄúThe support of our fans plays a big role in the morale of the team. We play for our country and our goal is to bring pride to our family of 20 million in this nation ‚Äì so your support is something that matters greatly to us ‚Ä¶ trust in us, and stick with us, so that you can be our strength as we rise again like lions,‚Äù said Upul Tharanga before the ODI series.

Sangakkara too called for fans to rally behind the team, ‚ÄúWhen we won, you celebrated with us, and when we lost, you grieved alongside us,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen the team was struggling ‚Äì when we were most in need ‚Äì your love and support was our strength. Now, what our cricketers need is that same, love, support, patience and effort. Let‚Äôs hope for the team‚Äôs victory, and support them as one.‚Äù

More Than Toilets,"Five states, 186 districts and over 2,31,000 villages have been declared as open defecation free (Representational Image) Five states, 186 districts and over 2,31,000 villages have been declared as open defecation free (Representational Image)

In 1937, Gandhiji, replying to a letter received from Birbhum, Bengal, wrote, ‚ÄúAn ideal village will be so constructed as to lend itself to perfect sanitation.‚Äù Having just celebrated the 70th anniversary of Independence, this is a good time to take stock of how the prime minister‚Äôs flagship programme, the (SBM), is progressing towards Gandhiji‚Äôs dream of a clean India with all its villages becoming open defecation free (ODF).

Launched in October 2014 and scheduled to culminate by October 2, 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, the SBM is close to completing three years. Overall, progress is good, with rural sanitation coverage having gone up from 39 per cent to 67 per cent in three years and over 230 million people in rural India have stopped defecating in the open. Five states, 186 districts and over 2,31,000 villages have been declared as ODF.

The major achievement, however, is not a spurt in the construction of toilets, but the focus on behaviour change, and the rapidly spreading public awareness of the need for sanitation and usage of toilets. The most significant policy shift in this regard has been the move from outputs (number of toilets built) to outcomes (ODF villages), since ODF signifies the entire village unit makes this commitment. There is increasing realisation in rural India that, in addition to the violation of dignity, especially that of women and girls, open defecation significantly adds to the disease burden, especially of children below the age of five.

It is one thing to build physical infrastructure like roads, bridges and power plants and quite another to engage 550 million people to fight against the centuries-old practice of open defecation. The SBM seeks to carry out one of the largest behaviour change campaigns in history, mainly through effective information, education and communication (IEC).

At one end of the IEC spectrum is the use of mass media: Print and electronic, using celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan leading a ‚ÄúDarwaza Bandh‚Äù (on open defecation) campaign. At the other end is the use of interpersonal communication, where trained grass roots level motivators, or swachhagrahis, work under an incentive-based system to ‚Äútrigger‚Äù behaviour change by stimulating community-level demand for toilets. Involving locally elected representatives, grass roots-level organisations, NGOs and school students in spreading awareness on sanitation is also a key aspect of the SBM‚Äôs approach to IEC.

The SBM ambitiously aims at having at least one trained grassroots-level swachhagrahi in each village in India, of which over 1,50,000 are already in place. Once a village declares itself as ODF, verification of the latter status becomes key for which the SBM guidelines provide for a 90-day window from the date of ODF declaration. The verification process also allows for any gaps or errors in ODF status to be rectified.

Currently, verification of ODF villages stands at around 56 per cent. To accelerate the verification process, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has recently issued policy guidelines that state governments will be eligible for release of the second instalment of central funds only if they have fully verified all their ODF villages. The programme also has a fairly robust system of verification at district and state level. At the national level, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, carries out separate checks as well as third party sample surveys by independent organisations. A national 1,40,000-household survey, carried out by the Quality Council of India during May-June 2017, found that national usage of toilets was 91 per cent.

The emphasis on sustainability is what differentiates SBM from previous sanitation programmes. Post ODF-declaration, it is possible that the village may witness some ‚Äúslip back‚Äù into open defecation due to old habits. It took courage and conviction for the PM to publically commit to make India open defecation free in a span of five years, a goal which many thought was impossible to achieve. There is still a fair way to go but, given the progress made so far, the acceleration expected over the coming 12-15 months and the active engagement of millions of people, the goal is definitely achievable.

Exercise mimicking protein may aid heart failure patients,"CT1 was found to help repair damage as well as improve blood flow in heart failure patients. (Source File Photo) CT1 was found to help repair damage as well as improve blood flow in heart failure patients. (Source File Photo)

Scientists have discovered a protein that mimics exercise and tricks the heart into growing in a healthy way and pumping more blood, a finding that can aid in developing treatments for heart failure patients. The study showed that a protein called cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) leads heart to pump more blood even if an individual is sitting still, making it beneficial, particularly for people with heart problems who find it hard to exercise.

CT1 was found to help repair damage as well as improve blood flow in heart failure patients. Heart failure, which occurs when the heart can‚Äôt pump enough blood through the body, is a leading cause of death and disability in high-income countries and a growing problem around the world. ‚ÄúWhen part of the heart dies, the remaining muscles try to adapt by getting bigger but this happens in a dysfunctional way and it doesn‚Äôt actually help the heart pump more blood,‚Äù said Lynn Megeney, Professor at the University of Ottawa in Canada.

‚ÄúWe found that CT1 causes heart muscles to grow in a more healthy way and it also stimulates blood vessel growth in the heart. This actually increases the heart‚Äôs ability to pump blood, just like what you would see with exercise and pregnancy,‚Äù Megeney added For the study, published in the journal Cell Research, the team conducted a variety of experiments in mice, rats and cells growing in the lab. Heart muscle cells treated with CT-1 were found to become longer and demonstrated healthier fibres.

Further, CT-1 also improved heart function in two animal models of heart failure one caused by a heart attack (affecting the left side of the heart) and one caused by high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension, affecting the right side of the heart). ‚ÄúThis experimental therapy is very exciting particularly because it shows promise in treating both left and right heart failure,‚Äù said Duncan Stewart, a cardiologist at the Ottawa Hospital.

"V K Sasikala didn‚Äôt go out, CCTV images are of inside jail, say officials","VK Sasikala praying (PTI Photo) VK Sasikala praying (PTI Photo)

A day after a CCTV footage emerged from Bengaluru central prison, showing V K Sasikala and an aide purportedly re-entering the jail from the main gate after a visit outside, prison officials Monday said these are images of the AIADMK chief and the associate entering an administrative block of the prison from the women‚Äôs enclosure. The CCTV images are believed to be a month old, and were provided to the Anti-Corruption Bureau and a committee probing charges made by former DIG (Prisons) D Roopa that jail rules were violated to give Sasikala preferential treatment.

The footage has reignited allegations that Sasikala, serving a four-year jail term in a disproportionate assets case, received favourable treatment at the Bengaluru jail, and that she was allowed to leave the jail during the day. According to prison officials, the images are not of Sasikala entering the prison from outside but making her way in civilian clothes to the administrative block of the jail, where she used to meet visitors in a room on the first floor until July, when she was named by DIG Roopa as being beneficiary of preferential treatment.

‚ÄúThe main entrance to the prison is three gates away. This is at Gate B ‚Äî the entrance to the administrative block from the women‚Äôs cell block,‚Äù a jail official said. The images show Sasikala and her associate escorted by male jail staff, and a male prisoner is seen moving around in prison clothes ‚Äî prison officials said male prisoners are not allowed near the jail entrance. ‚ÄúAll CCTV images from the prison have been collected by the committee investigating allegations of preferential treatment.

UFC gets aggressive with technology to enhance its fights,"WME-IMG bought the UFC last year for more than billion WME-IMG bought the UFC last year for more than billion

The UFC is turning to a high-tech platform that could enhance the way fans watch fights. The world‚Äôs leading mixed martial arts promotion has reached a partnership with Heed. The joint venture between WME-IMG and AGT International wants to change the way fans connect with sports at home or at a live event through sensor-measured data.

WME-IMG bought the UFC last year for more than $4 billion. ‚ÄúOur goal is to revolutionize our sport, our events and ultimately enhance the fan experience,‚Äù UFC CFO Andrew Schleimer said.

Heed also has struck deals with Professional Bull Riders and Euroleague basketball. The new format uses sensors that collect data on everything from fan and competitor emotion to real-time event tracking that could change how fights, bull rides or other events are scored.

‚ÄúThis gives us a solution that is better than the human alternative to judging the difficulty of a bull ride,‚Äù PBR CEO Sean Gleason said.

Gleason said PBR would roll out a side-by-side system in January and use the Heed technology as a full replacement to human judging in 2019.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have bull meters or information on G-forces that were applied that are available in television, digital products and social apps,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt helps new fans understand the difficulty and nuances of bull riding.‚Äù

No bull, PBR believed science can almost reinvent the sport. Heed will outfit both bull and rider with technology that measures spin, direction changes, kicks and rider control.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only an informational and educational tool for fans but will help new fans understand the difficulties and nuances of bull rides,‚Äù Gleason said. ‚ÄúNone of us have been on a bull, so it‚Äôs hard to have a frame of reference to how difficult bull riding is and how athletic it is. This tool will help explain that in scientific data. That will be great for the sport. This is revolutionary, not evolutionary for our sport. We are incorporating technology into the core of our scoring and the competitive results.‚Äù

At the premier European basketball competition, the EuroLeague, sensors will be deployed in all 16 arenas. They will collect data from fans, players and coaches. Heed will transform this information into video content and performance reports for fans on site and at home through TV broadcasting, social media and other digital distribution channels.

Heed sampled its technology on an old UFC fight that kept a running tally of blocks, jabs, hooks, overhands and uppercuts on the side and bottom of the screen.

‚ÄúFight Pass could be a very unique place to have some of these specific content and stories that we‚Äôre creating with Heed,‚Äù Schleimer said.

Heed says its technology can track fan or fighter emotions ranging from sadness and surprise to disgust and fear. The UFC said those tools, along with the fight tracking, could help the company stay more informed on a fighter‚Äôs health.

‚ÄúWe believe there‚Äôs a tremendous opportunity for us as UFC and for the fighters to benefit from a health and safety perspective,‚Äù Schleimer said. ‚ÄúJust by virtue of the types of things that we‚Äôre capturing, we‚Äôre going to be very much focused on how we can leverage that to enhance our brand, our promotion and our athletes, which we‚Äôre always looking to do, anything related to health and safety.‚Äù

India trounce Sri Lanka to keep domination going: How Twitterati reacted,"Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli took India cruising past the winning line. (Source: PTI) Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli took India cruising past the winning line. (Source: PTI)

India came into the ODI series against Sri Lanka with momentum firmly on their side. They had reached the final of the ICC Champions Trophy, beaten West Indies 3-1 in the Caribbean and had swept aside Sri Lanka in the Test series 3-0. India were doing exceptionally well with the ball, bat and in the field. Such as the dominance that it allowed India to rest some key members. And the first ODI, once again, showed why. The visitors posted a 9 wicket win in an all round show.

Buoyed by Shikhar Dhawan‚Äôs unbeaten 132 and equally valuable unbeaten 82 by Virat Kohli, India chased down Sri Lanka‚Äôs modest total of 216 runs to pick up the first win of the five-match-series and once again stamp their authority on what has been an extremely one sided series. Rohit Sharma was the only wicket to fall when the Mumbai batsman unluckily lost his bat and had his foot in the air as he ran inside the crease.

Earlier, Sri Lanka started well courtesy Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka with the latter producing some courageous hits. Dickwella and Kusal Mendis took up the service next but the hosts were undone by the Indian spinners. Such was their downfall that Sri Lanka went from 139/1 at one stage to be bowled out for 216.

Pakistan on Tuesday said that it wants peace in Afghanistan and pledged to work to eliminate terrorism, hours after US President Donald Trump‚Äôs stern warning to Islamabad over providing safe havens to terrorists.

A Foreign Office spokesman said US Ambassador David Hale met Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif this afternoon and briefed him about President Trump‚Äôs latest statement on the US policy review on South Asia and Afghanistan. ‚ÄúThe Foreign Minister reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs perspective and desire for peace and stability in Afghanistan,‚Äù said the carefully worded statement from the Foreign Office.

Highlighting Pakistan‚Äôs sacrifices in the enduring fight against terrorism, Foreign Minister Asif underlined Pakistan‚Äôs continued desire to work with the international community to eliminate the menace of terrorism.

Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to announce his Afghanistan and South Asia policy, hit out at Pakistan for providing safe havens to ‚Äúagents of chaos‚Äù that kill Americans in Afghanistan and warned Islamabad that it has ‚Äúmuch to lose‚Äù by harbouring terrorists.

He also slammed Pakistan for its support to terror groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so.

During his meeting, Asif said that he had accepted US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson‚Äôs invitation to visit the US and looked forward to his early interactions in Washington.

Hale conveyed that Tillerson looked forward to meeting the foreign minister in the next few days to have an in-depth discussion on the state of play in the bilateral relationship as well as the new US policy on South Asia.

A 16-year-old boy in the US has died after falling about 45-feet while volunteering on a construction project inside a Hindu temple in New Jersey, police said. The boy from Hatfield, Pennsylvania, was volunteering on a construction project at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir campus on Thursday in Robbinsville when he fell, Robbinsville police spokesman Lt Michael Polaski said.

The teen was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital at Hamilton, where he died an hour later, NBC Philadelphia reported. ‚ÄúThe victim fell about 45-feet and the fall appears to be an accident, but it is still under investigation,‚Äù Polaski said. Police have not released the identity of the victim.

Vinay Limbachia, a volunteer at the temple, said people at the temple were looking into what exactly the boy was helping with. The temple is inside a larger structure. The boy‚Äôs fall occurred inside the structure, but in an area next to the temple.

The boy and his family usually worshipped at the faith‚Äôs temple in Lansdale, Limbachia said. A second temple remains under construction on the campus.

A spokesperson said the worship site has been built completely by volunteers. The BAPS called the incident as a ‚Äútragic accident‚Äù and promised to work with Robbinsville Police. ‚ÄúThe entire BAPS family is heartbroken by the tragic accident that took the life of one of our young volunteers,‚Äù the organisation said in a statement.

‚ÄúThe prayers, condolences, and support of every BAPS family are with the family of this talented young man, whose loss will be felt by all those fortunate to have known him,‚Äù they said. The temple with its intricate marble carvings and Indian design was dedicated in August 2014 and draws thousands of worshipers from around the world.

REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco

Mourners at the funeral of a Philippine man who police shot dead protested his innocence on Sunday, the latest sign of rising anger over President Rodrigo Duterte‚Äôs bloody campaign to stamp out drugs. More than 12,500 people, many small-time drug users and dealers, have been killed since Duterte took office in June 2016. Police say about 3,500 of those killed were shot by officers in self-defence. Human rights monitors believe many of the remaining two thirds were killed by assassins operating with police backing or by police disguised as vigilantes ‚Äì a charge the police deny. On Sunday, dozens of mourners wearing with white T-shirts with the slogan ‚ÄúKill drugs, not people‚Äù, bore the coffin of Leover Miranda to his grave in a Manila cemetery.

Miranda was killed this month in what police said was a drug sting operation but relatives say he was innocent. ‚ÄúI want justice for my son,‚Äù Elvira Miranda, 69, told Reuters. ‚ÄúI have no powerful friends, I do not know what to do, but I want the people behind this senseless killing punished.‚Äù

Most people in the Philippines support the anti-drug campaign and Duterte remains a popular leader but questions have begun to be asked about the slaughter, with more than 90 people killed in a new surge of shootings in recent days. The country‚Äôs two most influential Catholic bishops on Sunday spoke against the latest deaths, asking the faithful to pray for the victims.

‚ÄúWe knock on the consciences of those who kill even the helpless, especially those who cover their faces ‚Ä¶ to stop wasting human lives,‚Äù said Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, archbishop of Manila. Another senior cleric, Archbishop Socrates Villegas, called for churches to ring their bells every evening at 8 p.m., to stir the consciences of the authorities. ‚ÄúYou shall not kill. That is a sin. That is against the law,‚Äù he said in a statement.

Public anger rose last week when police killed a 17 year-old high-school student. Television channels aired CCTV footage that showed Kian Loyd Delos Santos being carried by two men to a place where his body was later found, raising doubt about an official report that said he was shot because he fired at police.

Some civil society groups and left-wing activists have called for protests increasing anger with the police was evident in social media posts. Metro Manila police chief Oscar Albayalde said he has suspended the police chief in Caloocan City, where the boy was killed, pending an investigation. Three officers involved in the operation were earlier relieved of duties.

The justice department has also begun an investigation while senators will also summon police this week to explain the sudden rise in killings.

Liverpool must rotate their squad this season if they are to sustain their challenge in both the Premier League and the Champions League, manager Juergen Klopp has said.

Klopp made five changes to the starting lineup for Saturday‚Äôs 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace, a game sandwiched in between two legs of their Champions League playoff against Hoffenheim.

The German is taking nothing for granted despite Liverpool‚Äôs 2-1 lead over the Bundesliga side ahead of their return leg at Anfield.

‚ÄúWe all have pressure and it‚Äôs a quick start always,‚Äù Klopp told reporters. ‚ÄúYou need to be there immediately, deliver and all that stuff.

‚ÄúThe difference this year is that it‚Äôs really hard, we all know a draw today, two points instead of four or six, it doesn‚Äôt feel good but you can sort it.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do this in a Champions League qualifier. This intensity is really hard, for both teams not just us, yes that‚Äôs very special and that‚Äôs why we made the changes today.‚Äù

Substitutes Dejan Lovren, Emre Can and Mohamed Salah are all expected to return to the starting lineup against Hoffenheim on Wednesday.

Klopp said he will keep shuffling his pack during the European competition as long as the replacements continue to impress. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about the boys. If they play in a game like this today, if they perform like this then yes, we will change, 100 percent,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúIf not, we can‚Äôt because we cannot give a game away, we cannot say that‚Äôs not that important.‚Äù Following their European qualifier, Liverpool host Arsenal in the league on Sunday.

Chinese Grand Priz set to extend stay,"Shanghai International Circuit held its first race in 2004. Shanghai International Circuit held its first race in 2004.

A new deal to keep the Chinese Grand Prix in the Formula One calendar has been agreed in principle and will likely be sealed within weeks, a senior F1 official said on Tuesday.

The sport, under ambitious new US-based owners, released its 2018 race schedule in June and Shanghai was only listed as provisional, along with Singapore. That prompted speculation that both races might be axed from the roster.

But Sean Bratches, F1 managing director of commercial operations, told AFP in Shanghai: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working hard with Juss Event, the promoter, and we‚Äôve got an agreement in principle. My suspicion is that it will be executed by the end of next month, fully executed.‚Äù

Bratches said that F1 chiefs released next year‚Äôs race schedule earlier than previously as part of efforts to make Formula One more fan- and sponsor-friendly.

‚ÄúNext year the schedule will be released and there will be nothing provisional about Shanghai because we will have a long-term deal,‚Äù he added, following talks in the city that pushed the agreement along.

The current deal for the Chinese Grand Prix is due to finish at the end of this year. The Shanghai International Circuit held its first race in 2004.

"Judwaa 2 trailer launch: Varun Dhawan, Taapsee Pannu, Jacqueline Fernandez burn the stage on the tunes of ‚ÄòTan Tana Tan‚Äô","The trailer of Judwaa 2, one of the most awaited remakes in Bollywood was released at a big bash in Mumbai today and going by the pictures, it looks like the team including Varun Dhawan, Taapsee Pannu and Jacqueline Fernandez had a blast with their fans. Helmed by David Dhawan, Judwaa 2 is a rehash version of the Salman Khan and Karisma Kapoor-starrer Judwaa which released in 1997.

The actors sportingly crooned to the tunes of ""Tan Tana Tan"" at the launch, much to the astonishment of their fans. Apart from ""Tan Tana Tan"", Judwaa 2 will also reprise the famous Anu Malik number ""Oonchi Hai Building"" in the remake.

While Salman Khan's Judwaa has found a place of its own in Bollywood, we need to see what Judwaa 2 has in store for fans. Salman Khan, who played the lead in the original flick, is also going to make a cameo appearance in this one.

The Judwaa 2 team apparently brought their own twist to the event and arrived with 50 pairs of real twins for the launch.

Looks like, the actors also shook a leg on the upcoming songs from the film. While Judwaa 2 features Varun in a double role - geeky Prem and badass Raja, Jacqueline and Taapsee are all set to step into the shoes of Karisma Kapoor and Rambha."

The song, composed by musical duo Sachin-Jigar, is inspired by mMaa ‚Äì the divine mother of cosmos and represents the Shiv-Shakti concept.

Music composer Sachin-Jigar said, ‚ÄúSanjay Dutt is an all rounder. He can sing, act and dance effortlessly at the same time. He is a multi-tasking rockstar for us. He has sung a few Sanskrit shlokas and took precisely 60 minutes in the studio to deliver his part with no prior training.‚Äù

Boston: ‚ÄòFree speech rally‚Äô cut short after massive counter-protest,"Counterprotesters hold signs at a ‚ÄúFree Speech‚Äù rally by conservative activists on Boston Common, Saturday in Boston. (AP Photo) Counterprotesters hold signs at a ‚ÄúFree Speech‚Äù rally by conservative activists on Boston Common, Saturday in Boston. (AP Photo)

Thousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday on downtown Boston in a boisterous repudiation of white nationalism, dwarfing a small group of conservatives who cut short their planned ‚Äúfree speech rally‚Äù a week after a gathering of hate groups led to bloodshed in Virginia.

Counterprotesters marched through the city to historic Boston Common, where many gathered near a bandstand abandoned early by conservatives who had planned to deliver a series of speeches. Police vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counter-protesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.

Members of the Black Lives Matter movement later protested on the Common, where a Confederate flag was burned and protesters pounded on the sides of a police vehicle. Later Saturday afternoon, Boston‚Äôs police department tweeted that protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them and asked people publicly to refrain from doing so. Boston Commissioner William Evans said 27 arrests were made _ mostly for disorderly conduct while some were for assaulting police officers. Officials said the rallies drew about 40,000 people.

Trump applauded the people in Boston who he said were ‚Äúspeaking out‚Äù against bigotry and hate. Trump added in a Twitter message that ‚ÄúOur country will soon come together as one!‚Äù

Organizers of the event, which had been billed as a ‚ÄúFree Speech Rally,‚Äù had publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. A woman was killed at that Unite the Right rally, and many others were injured, when a car plowed into counterdemonstrators.

Opponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the specter of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering in a major U.S. city since Charlottesville. One of the planned speakers of the conservative activist rally said the event ‚Äúfell apart.‚Äù Congressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, told WCVB-TV that he didn‚Äôt realize ‚Äúhow unplanned of an event it was going to be.‚Äù

Some counter-protesters dressed entirely in black and wore bandannas over their faces. They chanted anti-Nazi and anti-fascism slogans, and waved signs that said: ‚ÄúMake Nazis Afraid Again,‚Äù ‚ÄúLove your neighbor,‚Äù ‚ÄúResist fascism‚Äù and ‚ÄúHate never made US great.‚Äù Others carried a large banner that read: ‚ÄúSMASH WHITE SUPREMACY.‚Äù

Chris Hood, a free speech rally attendee from Dorchester, said people were unfairly making it seem like the rally was going to be ‚Äúa white supremacist Klan rally.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat was never the intention,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve only come here to promote free speech on college campuses, free speech on social media for conservative, right-wing speakers. And we have no intention of violence.‚Äù Rockeem Robinson, a youth counselor from Cambridge, said he joined the counter-protest to ‚Äúshow support for the black community and for all minority communities.‚Äù

TV cameras showed a group of boisterous counter-protesters on the Common chasing a man with a Trump campaign banner and cap, shouting and swearing at him. But other counter-protesters intervened and helped the man safely over a fence into the area where the conservative rally was to be staged. Black-clad counter-protesters also grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman‚Äôs hands, and she stumbled and fell to the ground.

Saturday‚Äôs showdown was mostly peaceable, and after demonstrators dispersed, a picnic atmosphere took over with stragglers tossing beach balls, banging on bongo drums and playing reggae music. The Boston Free Speech Coalition, which organized the event, said it has nothing to do with white nationalism or racism and its group is not affiliated with the Charlottesville rally organizers in any way.

Rallies in other cities around the country each attracted hundreds of people who wanted to show their opposition to white supremacist groups. Counterprotesters marched through New Orleans, some of them carrying signs that read ‚ÄúWhite People Against White Supremacy‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter.‚Äù

In Atlanta, a diverse crowd marched from the city‚Äôs downtown to the home of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Meredith Dub√© brought along her two daughters, 2-year-old Willow Dub√© and 12-year-old Rai Chin. Dub√© is white and her daughters are mixed race. She said it is essential to show children at an early age that love is more powerful than hate.

An anti-racism rally was held in Laguna Beach, California, one day before the group America First! planned to hold a demonstration in the same place that‚Äôs being billed as an ‚ÄúElectric Vigil for the Victims of Illegals and Refugees.‚Äù Mayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that ‚ÄúLaguna Beach doesn‚Äôt tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.‚Äù

In Dallas, officials were expecting thousands of people for a Saturday evening rally against white supremacy at city hall plaza, a short distance from the city‚Äôs Confederate War Memorial. About a half-dozen people wearing camouflage and toting guns patrolled Pioneer Park and its Civil War cemetery. They said they were there to make sure there was no vandalism to graves or the Confederate memorial.

"Kareena, Karisma steal our hearts with their ageless beauty but Taimur Ali Khan takes away all the attention","We can't help but feel envious of the genetically blessed Kapoor sisters - Kareena and Karisma.

Kareena and Karisma were recently spotted shooting for an advertisement together. This is for the first time that they would appear on screen together. Karisma shared some behind the scene moments with her fans. And out of all, it is Taimur's presence that just took the photo to another level. Taimur was accompanied by Karisma's children, daughter Samiera Kapoor and son Kiaan Raj Kapoor.

The sisters bonded post the shoot as well. We can say that Kareena and Karisma are true examples of how sisters can be each other's best friend.

While Karisma has chosen to stay away from the screens, Kareena is prepping up for Veerey Di Wedding."
Don‚Äôt check mining of minor minerals: Jharkhand to police,"The Jharkhand government has asked the state police not to involve itself in checking mining and transportation of minor minerals, including sand, and has put the onus for this on district and state mining officials. Officials said this would help stamp out corruption, problems of coordination and fix accountability of mining officials.

An order to this effect was issued Monday by the IG (Operations) to all district police superintendents. It said that, in case of need, when officials concerned seek help, a police team would accompany them on raids.

Secretary (Personnel) and Jharkhand government spokesperson Nidhi Khare said: ‚ÄúMining and transportation of minor minerals, including sand, is controlled under the Mines and Minerals Act in which there are proper provisions giving the authority to the mining officials to take action if there is illegal mining or transportation. They are more technically equipped to deal with such cases and the problem of vigil by different agencies will be done away with.‚Äù

"Concerned over law and order situation, Punjab tells Centre","Haryana police and paramilitary personnel in Sirsa, Haryana, Monday. (Express Photo) Haryana police and paramilitary personnel in Sirsa, Haryana, Monday. (Express Photo)

THE PUNJAB government has expressed serious apprehensions about the law and order situation in the state in the wake of the upcoming August 25 verdict in the rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. ‚ÄúThere is apprehension among DSS [Dera Sacha Sauda] followers that the judicial verdict can go against Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who may be pronounced guilty and there may be jubilation among radical Sikhs,‚Äù said the Punjab Home department. Quoting intelligence reports, it has written to the Union Home Secretary, requesting 256 companies of central armed police forces to Punjab for 11 days from August 21 to August 31.

A CBI court in Panchkula will pronounce the verdict in the alleged rape of a Sadhvi in which Gurmeet Ram Rahim is the accused. The state home department said there were 13 districts with sizeable Dera followers in Punjab and 12 companies of paramilitary force are to be deployed in each of those districts. In three police commissionerates of Amritsar, Ludhiana and Jalandhar, 10 companies is the projected requirement and five companies each for 11 other districts. Another 15 companies were projected to be deployed to secure the railway network.

There are 98 Naam Charcha Ghars, the name given to Dera religious halls across Punjab and the state wants to deploy forces at each to prevent an outbreak of violence around these. ‚ÄúA lot of material is already circulating on social media, including Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and other platforms, leading to the building-up of an atmosphere of distrust and anger,‚Äù said a communique by the Punjab Home department to the Union Home Secretary, adding that Punjab had already begun meticulous planning and preparations to meet any eventualty.

‚ÄúDetailed meetings are being held to formulate strategy and discuss various important measures to tackle any situation. All the resources are being mobilised and orders have been issued that there is 100 per cent force mobilisation in all the districts. In addition to the force available at district level, additional manpower from the armed battalions is also being mobilised. As many as 40 companies of armed police, 19 anti-riot police teams, 03 Striking Groups and 01 Ghatak Team have been mobilised. Further, 7550 police personnel from various units and wings, including training institutes, have been mobilised for deployment to face the current challenge. Army authorities have also been alerted so that their assistance can be taken as and when the need arises,‚Äù it said.

Making the case for central help, the communique said available and mobilised forces of the state police alone will not be sufficient to tackle the grave and precarious law and order situation that may arise if an adverse verdict is passed against the Dera Sacha Sauda chief. Adding to the tension are the hostile relations between Sikhs and Dera followers.

Ever since he invited the ire of the Sikhs by allegedly imitating the tenth Sikh Guru at a ceremony akin to the creation of the Khalsa, during which he is said to have worn clothes similar to those worn by the Sikh guru, the community has been hostile towards the Dera followers. SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said, ‚ÄúIt is the duty of the state government to take precautionary measures to maintain law and order. It is not a political issue.‚Äù

Sensex falls 266 points: Infosys shareholders lose over Rs 34K-cr in 2 days,"Market capitalisation of Infosys fell by another Rs 12,000 crore on Monday. (Express Archive Photo) Market capitalisation of Infosys fell by another Rs 12,000 crore on Monday. (Express Archive Photo)

The tremors caused by the exit of Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka continued to hit the stock on Monday, with the information technology (IT) giant falling another 5.37 per cent on the bourses amid reports that the company is unlikely to miss the FY18 earnings targets. The benchmark Sensex gave up early gains to end 266 points lower, while the Nifty cracked below the 9,800-mark, pulled down by heavyweight Infosys and other blue-chips amid a lower opening in Europe.

Market capitalisation of Infosys fell by another Rs 12,000 crore on Monday. Investors have now lost Rs 34,500 crore in Infosys shares in the last two sessions as the market cap has now tanked to Rs 200,640 crore. Despite the Rs 13,000-crore share buyback announcement, Infosys scrip, once the favourite of mutual funds, closed at Rs 873.50 on the BSE on Monday. It had plunged 9.60 per cent on Friday.

The 30-share Sensex ended 265.83 points lower, or 0.84 per cent, at 31,258.85. The gauge had lost 270.78 points in the previous session on Friday. The broader NSE Nifty moved between 9,884.35 and 9,740.10, before ending down 83.05 points, or 0.84 per cent, at 9,754.35. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs uncertainty over the company‚Äôs future‚Ä¶ especially about the new CEO. There‚Äôs also talk of revamping the board,‚Äù said veteran BSE dealer Pawan Dharnidharka.

Jayant Manglik, president, retail distribution, Religare Securities, said: ‚ÄúThough the market opened with an uptick, but selling pressure at higher level gradually pushed the benchmark lower.‚Äù

Weakness persisted in the market amid heightened global tensions and uncertainty in the US administration. ‚ÄúWhile the markets did open on a positive note, cautious investors capped gains and dragged them lower. Global investors were skittish as the joint military drills between the US and South Korea begin from Monday. Additionally, US equities closed off their session lows on Friday after Steve Bannon, one of President Donald Trump‚Äôs top advisors, left the administration, further casting doubts over the current administrations abilities to bring about positive change,‚Äù said Karthikraj Lakshmanan, senior fund manager, BNP Paribas MF.

All the sectoral indices traded in the red with the healthcare and PSU banking indices losing over one per cent.

Meanwhile, the rupee pared its most of early gains to end marginally up at 64.14 against the dollar due to demand from importers and corporates. The rupee had opened with modest gain of 10 paise at 64.05 per dollar but later traded in a tight range in absence of any fresh macroeconomic clue, dealers said.

In a suspected hit-and-run case, two persons were killed and another injured near Alipur‚Äôs NH-1 area. A passerby spotted them lying unconscious in the early hours of Monday, police said. The victims have been identified as Suraj Keshri and Rahul, while the injured man has been identified as Lakshu. The three men suffered injuries on their heads and hands and also had bruises on their bodies, suggesting that they may have been dragged along the road during the accident.

Police are yet to ascertain the sequence of events and record the statement of Lakshu, who is undergoing treatment at LNJP Hospital. Suraj‚Äôs family said the accident took place on his son Aryan‚Äôs fifth birthday. ‚ÄúSuraj had promised to return after meeting his friend, Rahul, as he had not met him for many days. He left home around 11 pm,‚Äù said Suraj‚Äôs wife, Basanti Keshri.

Suraj, Lakshu and Rahul had planned a get-together before Aryan‚Äôs birthday, so Suraj took his Apache bike and picked up Lakshu. The two met Rahul near Jahangirpuri. Police said the three men were on one bike and only one of them was wearing a helmet.

Quoting the medico-legal report, police said the three were riding the bike under the influence of alcohol. ‚ÄúA passerby spotted them lying near Shani Mandir area near NH-1. We got to know about the incident around 4 am,‚Äù police said.

The men were shifted to Raja Harish Chandra Hospital, where doctors declared Suraj and Rahul dead. Their bodies were shifted to BJRM hospital for post-mortem. ‚ÄúWe could identify them only after we found their ID cards. There is no evidence as of now of an errant car, and there are no eyewitnesses. The men could also have met with an accident while negotiating a sharp turn. We are waiting for Lakshu to regain consciousness to shed more light on the case,‚Äù the officer said.

Senior IAS officer V Umashankar, who is municipal commissioner of Gurugram, and Hisar Range Inspector General of Police Amitabh Dhillon would be going to Sirsa on Tuesday. A senior officer told The Indian Express that if needed, they may hold talks with the Dera management to maintain peace. ‚ÄúWe will do all that is required to maintain the rule of law, hopefully, with minimal collateral damage,‚Äù said Dhillon. Both the officers were posted as deputy commissioner and superintendent of police, respectively, in Sirsa when there was a conflict between the Dera followers and Sikh organisations in 2008.

The government, meanwhile, has asked the district authorities to form peace committees under the chairmanship of deputy commissioners. Besides, revenue and other officials have also been asked to coordinate with the Dera followers in villages. Contact is being established with Dera people and efforts were on to maintain peace.

The government has asked police officers to identify antisocial to take preventive measures. Ahead of judgment day, the police will put up barricades at all inter-state and inter-district borders.

Meanwhile, Haryana Additional Chief Secretary (Home), Ram Niwas, in a video conference with DCs, SPs, commissioners and police commissioners, asked them to take all possibe steps to maintain law and order. He also urged the Dera Sacha Sauda followers to respect the court‚Äôs judgment to be announced on August 25 and help maintain law and order. ‚ÄúThe word ‚ÄòPremi‚Äô is associated with the names of Dera followers and they perform social service. It is hoped that the Dera followers would present a good example with the same spirit and help in maintaining peace and brotherhood in the state,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe will not let anyone disturb peace as well as the law and order situation. If anybody does, he will be punished,‚Äù warned Ram Niwas.

Scott McCarron birdied the final three holes to beat California childhood rival Kevin Sutherland by a stroke Sunday in the Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods Open.

McCarron closed with an 8-under 64 a day after shooting a 61 at En-Joie to join Sutherland atop the leaderboard entering the final round in the PGA Tour Champions event.

‚ÄúTo go low like I did the last couple days, I‚Äôve never played that kind of golf for two days,‚Äù McCarron said. ‚ÄúMy hat‚Äôs off to Kevin. He played such good golf and it just got to be match play. It was like we were back in high school playing against each other, it was so much fun.‚Äù

The 52-year-old McCarron matched Sutherland with a birdie on the par-4 16th, took the lead with a 12-footer on the par-3 17th and won with a 15-footer on the par-4 18th after driving well right and hitting an approach over trees. He finished at 20-under 196.

‚ÄúTo birdie that last hole from where I drove it, I drove it so bad, I think they‚Äôre going to put a plaque out there,‚Äù McCarron joked. Sutherland birdied the 16th and 18th in a 65.

‚ÄúI played really well this week, no complaints,‚Äù Sutherland said. ‚ÄúScott played fantastic. It was a lot of fun. I‚Äôve known Scott since junior golf, so it was a lot of fun.‚Äù

McCarron has three victories this year and five in the last two seasons on the PGA Tour Champions. The three-time PGA Tour winner won the Allianz Championship in February and the major Senior Players Championship in July.

Sutherland missed a chance for his first senior title and another chance to top his old Sacramento rival. Sutherland‚Äôs lone PGA Tour victory came in 2002 at La Costa in the Accenture Match Play Championship, when he beat McCarron 1 up in the 36-hole final.

‚ÄúI know if I keep doing what I‚Äôm doing, eventually it will happen,‚Äù said Sutherland, who shot a PGA Tour Champions-record 59 three years ago at En-Joie. ‚ÄúBut I did a lot of good things today and I can build on that.‚Äù

Sutherland holed out from the fairway for eagle on the par-4 ninth to tie McCarron for the lead, and pulled ahead with a birdie on the par-5 12th. McCarron tied it again with a birdie on the par-4 13th.

‚ÄúI needed to birdie one more hole the last three and he got it done,‚Äù Sutherland said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the difference, he birdied the last three and I birdied two of the last three.‚Äù

John Daly (66), local favorite Joey Sindelar (69) and Woody Austin (68) tied for third at 13 under. Charles Schwab Cup leader Bernhard Langer was 12 under after a 69. The 59-year-old Langer has a tour-high four victories, winning three of the five major championships.

"Conor McGregor must stick to what he knows, says former sparring partner Steve Collins Junior","The boxing world has scoffed at the notion that McGregor can bring himself up to Floyd‚Äôs level in the space of a few weeks. (Source: AP) The boxing world has scoffed at the notion that McGregor can bring himself up to Floyd‚Äôs level in the space of a few weeks. (Source: AP)

Conor McGregor should rely on the skills that have made him a two-weight UFC champ and not try to out-box unbeaten American Floyd Mayweather when the two clash in Las Vegas on Saturday, former sparring partner Steve Collins Junior told Reuters.

The Irish mixed martial arts fighter turned up at the Dublin gym run by Collins Jnr‚Äôs uncle Paschal about two years ago looking to hone his boxing skills, and the 27-year-old light heavyweight was happy to go toe to toe with him.

‚ÄúI arrived early as my uncle told me to come in to do some pad work before the place opened and Conor came up. He must have cleared it with my uncle as he had the place to himself, he had the gym closed off,‚Äù Collins Jnr said in a telephone interview.

‚ÄúHe started off sparring a guy for a round or two but the guy couldn‚Äôt keep up with Conor‚Äôs pace, so my uncle asked me if I‚Äôd spar him. I said fine, and got in there for five, six, seven rounds,‚Äù he explained.

‚ÄúConor didn‚Äôt care about the size difference between us, he just kept going. He barely took a break in between rounds, he‚Äôd just take a sip of water or whatever.‚Äù

The Collins family are as close to boxing royalty as it gets in Ireland, with Steve Collins Senior a former WBO middleweight and super-middleweight world champ, and uncle Paschal a renowned boxing coach.

Collins Jnr, who has 10 wins, one loss and one draw in his 12 professional fights, was impressed by the offensive skills of the 29-year-old McGregor, who has never fought as a pro boxer.

‚ÄúAs an MMA fighter his boxing skills were brilliant ‚Äì great stance, great balance, great shot selection and timing, he judged distance very well, superior to most MMA fighters.‚Äù However, the boxer did find chinks in the armour of the UFC lightweight champion.

‚ÄúHis only weakness really was his defence. I didn‚Äôt find it to hard to land leather on him, and if you‚Äôve got a guy like Floyd, he may find it even easier. If I had to pick one thing, it was that his defence wasn‚Äôt brilliant,‚Äù he said.

The boxing world has scoffed at the notion that McGregor can bring himself up to Floyd‚Äôs level in the space of a few weeks, but Collins says he may not have to.

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôll have to rely on what he already knows. There is so much to learn in boxing, even Mayweather is still learning, so Conor has to work with what he has. ‚ÄúIt takes years to be a complete fighter, and it will all be new to him on the day,‚Äù he said.

Mayweather, who has not fought in nearly two years, needs a win to surpass Rocky Marciano‚Äôs record and reach 50-0 for his career, while McGregor, who is making his professional boxing debut, is 21-3 in mixed martial arts.

Currently in training for a fight in Belfast in September, Collins Jnr says he will watch the fight but he won‚Äôt travel to Las Vegas or stay up into the small hours to do so.

‚ÄúIf I was on Mayweather or McGregor money I‚Äôd go to Vegas, but I‚Äôm not! ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in training so I can‚Äôt afford to stay up all night, but we‚Äôre going to record it and watch it together at the gym the next morning,‚Äù he said, adding that he expected an exciting fight. ‚ÄúThings Conor never expected are going to happen to him in the ring, and how he reacts to that will say a lot about him.‚Äù

Game of Thrones Season 7 Episode 7 preview: Get ready for monumental clash between major power players,"Game of Thrones Season 7 Episode 7 preview: The teaser of the ultimate episode from the season is out. Game of Thrones Season 7 Episode 7 preview: The teaser of the ultimate episode from the season is out.

With only one episode left in Game of Thrones‚Äô seventh season, we are expecting nothing less than 81 minutes of bloody battles and epic encounters. And judging by the latest trailer, it looks like the episode is going to meet our expectations.

The last episode Beyond The Wall saw Jon Snow capture a wight for Cersei Lannister and almost every major player in Westeros is headed to King‚Äôs Landing for a meeting with the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei Lannister.

From Jon Snow to Tyrion Lannister, the teaser shows almost everyone entering what appears to be the Dragonpit, a coliseum-like structure that was once used to stable dragons. Well, major face-off alert, the three Lannister kids, Cersei, Jaime and Tyrion appear face-to-face for the first time after Tyrion killed their father. And although Daenerys is missing from the teaser, we are sure she has a smashing role to play here. Maybe, she enters later.

While Greyworm is leading the Unsullied, looks like the Dothraki are joining hands to attack Highgarden. Lady of the North Sansa Stark is at Winterfell but things look fishy. Why the hood? Our money is on a leading character‚Äôs death. Not Arya, please! But after their heated tiff in the previous episodes and Lord Baelish‚Äôs cunning presence, it‚Äôs hard to believe that things won‚Äôt go south in the North.

In the last scene, Jon Snow says what he has almost been saying constantly since many episodes, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one war that matters and it is here.‚Äù

With somber music and just one dialogue, the trailer is heart-pounding and is already giving us goosebumps. Game of Thrones Season 7 airs in India on Star World and Star World HD every Tuesday at 11 PM.

Remember the crying kid‚Äôs video that Virat Kohli shared? This is who she really is,"The plot thickens. (Source: Virat Kohli/Instagram) The plot thickens. (Source: Virat Kohli/Instagram)

Virat Kohli recently shared a video of a crying kid while being taught by her mother, and left people debating over it to no end. In the 2-minute 46-second clip, a woman can be seen slapping her daughter for not being able to memorise the numbers. ‚ÄúThe fact that the pain and anger of the child is ignored and ones own ego to make the child learn is so massive that compassion has totally gone out of the window. This is shocking and saddening to another dimension. A child can never learn if intimidated. This is hurtful,‚Äù the Indian cricket team caption captioned it. A lot of other people also shared it on their social media pages, including cricketers Yuvraj Singh and Shikhar Dhawan. While people agree that parents need to be strict to help their child be dedicated towards studies, violence is not the answer. Not only did the video irk many viewers, a lot of them stood by the cricketers and slammed the mother of the child.

Take a look at their posts here.

The real identity of the kid has now surfaced on the Internet. Quite surprisingly, she happens to be the niece of singer and music composer duo Toshi and Sharib Sabri. Hindustan Times spoke to Toshi about the unfortunate incident, and he went on to clarify the dreadful act. Spelling out that ‚Äúthe video was made for the family‚Äôs WhatsApp group‚Äù, he told the newspaper, ‚ÄúOne can‚Äôt judge a mother‚Äôs love for the child by seeing a short video. If children throw tantrums, then should we stop teaching them? It‚Äôs not easy to raise children. Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan don‚Äôt know about us. We know about our child better. Haya‚Äôs nature is such that after being scolded, the next minute she runs off to play. But, because of her nature if we don‚Äôt push her, she won‚Äôt study. All the crying was for that moment so that her mother doesn‚Äôt make her study and let her play. Haya is just about 3 years old. In every house there are different kind of children. Ours is a very stubborn child but is extremely dear to us.‚Äù

There were a lot of posts of the little one playing and laughing on Sabri‚Äôs Instagram account earlier, but all of them have been removed now.

From Punjab‚Äôs farm to Edgbaston: Sukhjit Singh charts ‚Äòincredible‚Äô journey,"Sukhjit, who made his first-class debut for Warwickshire in May, was named England‚Äôs 12th man in the Edgbaston Test match against West Indies. Sukhjit, who made his first-class debut for Warwickshire in May, was named England‚Äôs 12th man in the Edgbaston Test match against West Indies.

Sitting not far from the Edgbaston dressing room where his ward rubs shoulders with Joe Root & Co, and momentarily switching off from the historic Day-Night Test unfolding infront of him, Eaton Gordon, on phone from Birmingham, shares a story that he calls ‚Äúincredible‚Äù. Eight years back, Gordon, Warwickshire‚Äôs cricket development officer, had spotted a restless teenager who juggled cricket, academics and long hours at a local supermarket. Raised by her widowed mother Paramjit, a reluctant immigrant from Punjab, Sukhjit Singh, owing to his friendly disposition and radiant smile, was called Sunny on the cricket circuit.

Sunny, at 21, within months of making his first-class debut for Warwickshire, was named England‚Äôs 12th man ‚Äî an opportunity the England board extends to talented local players. ‚ÄúI was not sure that he would get this far, I first saw him in 2009 during his school trials, and what impressed me was his enthusiasm and the high energy levels,‚Äù Gordon says on Day 3 when England took 19 wickets to send West Indies to a humbling innings defeat. What Gordon is narrating is just one of the chapters of this ‚Äúincredible‚Äù story that starts at Manolian, a village in Hoshiarpur district.

When Sukhjit was just 5, he lost his father, forcing the tiny tot to be a farm hand. Sport wasn‚Äôt something little Sukhjit had time for. The watershed moment for the struggling family came when Sukhjit‚Äôs mother Paramjit, a few years after her husband‚Äôs death, decided to take the big leap and join her extended family in England. The Manolian to Midlands transition was brutal on Sukhjit. The adolescent boy would be a mute spectator in the new surroundings and alien culture. The language barrier would escalate the pain of loneliness.

As a teenager in Handsworth, a bustling Birmingham suburb largely consisting of Asian immigrants, he never quite saw cricket as a feasible career option. Like many of his friends with Indian roots, the young boy from Punjab had modest dreams. Climbing up the supermarket hierarchy being one of them, helping his mother Paramjit, who had started selling Indian sweets, was another option. Things changed in 2009 when Gordon, who was then associated with Chance to Shine, a charity organisation partially funded by the England and Wales Cricket Board came scouting for talent at Sukhjit‚Äôs school in Handsworth.

‚ÄúSunny instantly caught the attention of our coach (Gordon), and he has since then been under our wings. Today, he is the first cricketer from our organisation to have progressed to play in county cricket,‚Äù says Adam Sofroniou, Communication Officer, Chance to Shine. The charity organisation set up in 2005, has ties with 39 counties in and around the United Kingdom and promotes cricket at junior schools. Under the tutelage of Chance to Shine, Sukhjit took the tentative steps, showcasing his wares as a left-arm fast bowler at the U-13 level. After what was a relatively smooth induction to junior cricket, the budding fast bowler hit his first speed bump.

While playing in an U-14 club game seven summers ago, he was carted around by opposition batsmen, conceding close to 40 runs from three overs. ‚ÄúThis can have damaging consequences on your morale,‚Äù Gordon explains. Such was the impact of that assault that Sukhjit came to Gordon the following morning and said: ‚ÄúSir, I want to bowl spin.‚Äù Gordon, though, was not surprised. ‚ÄúIf anything, the shift made him more serious about his game.‚Äù

Prize scalp

He has made steady progress since, making his first-class debut against Somerset in May this year, when he made an instant impact. ‚ÄúWhen you get someone like Dean Elgar (he was playing for Somerset) as your first scalp, it shows that you‚Äôre not doing too badly,‚Äù Gordon says. Getting the South African opener in the opening game boosted his confidence, after which he went on to scalp six more in his second first-class game against Hampshire. Warwickshire would go on to lose that game, but Sunny‚Äôs reputation was firmly enhanced. He has featured in four first-class games, but has already managed to create enough buzz.

Gordon, though, has a word of caution for his brightest ward. ‚ÄúHe still has a long way to go as a bowler‚Ä¶ has a wonderful action, but needs to be more consistent, and must keep working on variations like the arm-ball.‚Äù Over the years, help came from several quarters, not just Gordon alone. Ashley Giles, the former England left-arm spinner, the man in charge of Warwickshire cricket, has taken the young spinner from Hoshiarpur under his wings.

Last winter, Sukhjit spent three months in Darren Lehmann‚Äôs Adelaide academy ‚Äî after he was chosen amongst players from various counties ‚Äî as part of ECB‚Äôs exchange programme. This experience proved invaluable. ‚ÄúHe was home-sick and hated Australia initially. But I‚Äôm glad that he went for it. The trip has toughened him up,‚Äù Gordon observes. Listening to Gordon, it‚Äôs easy to guess the reason behind Sukhjit‚Äôs home-sickness ‚Äî Paramjit‚Äôs sumptuous savouries. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve not been in touch with her lately. She is a good cook and makes these wonderful sweets. I had tasted something which she had made long ago‚Ä¶don‚Äôt remember what the name was,‚Äù the man, who had a big role to play in cricket‚Äôs latest fairytale that is being talked about at Edgbaston, recalls.

Former England captain Mike Atherton has dedicated his pre-Test column in The Times to the boy from Birmingham. ‚ÄúHe came to the game through neither family nor private school, rather a circuitous route starting in Punjab and ending at Edgbaston, via a state school, a supermarket job stacking shelves, the charity Chance to Shine, Birmingham club cricket, Warwickshire‚Äôs representative age-group teams and now first-class cricket.‚Äù Now, that‚Äôs an incredible journey.

After completion of the deliberations, the CEOs will make presentation to the Prime Minister on action points on Tuesday, which could be incorporated in the 15-Year Vision Document being prepared by Niti Aayog, the official said. The six groups of CEOs may be attached to the concerned ministries going forward, as part of the government plan to institutionalise such meetings.

Other corporate executives who are attending the meeting include ‚Äî Rama Kirloskar, MD, Kirloskar Ebara Pumps; Deep Kalra, chairman and Group CEO, MakeMyTrip; Vinod Dasari, MD, Ashok Leyland; Pratt and Whitney India head Palash Roy Choudhury; Raman Mittal, Executive Director, Sonalika International Tractors, V Vaidyanathan, Executive Chairman, Capital First, among others.

This is the second series of such meetings Modi is having with the business fraternity after he met around 200 start-up entrepreneurs last Thursday, where the Prime Minister prodded them to devise systems and solutions that help in ‚Äúimproving governance‚Äù. Asking young entrepreneurs to innovate and suggest solutions to deal with different issues, Modi had said he would like Champions of Change event to be an annual feature.

Modi had said the different groups of entrepreneurs, which were set up to suggest policy initiatives, could be attached with the relevant ministries on a permanent basis. Six groups of young entrepreneurs last week made presentations to Modi on subjects such as soft power, Incredible India 2.0, education and skill development; health and nutrition, Digital India and New India by 2022.

(AP Photo/Santi Palacios)

Spanish authorities on Saturday said they are maintaining the country‚Äôs current terrorist threat alert at level 4, as reported by the Associated Press. Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the government would reinforce security in crowded areas and tourist hotspots, after a van mowed down people in Barcelona on Thursday, killing at least 13 people including many foreigners from different countries. Another person died after a separate attack in the resort town of Cambrils, where police shot five suspects dead. ‚ÄúWe are going to redirect our efforts and will adapt these to every place or area that needs special protection,‚Äù Zoido told a news conference.

Zoido also said Spanish authorities considered the cell behind the attacks had been fully dismantled.

Spanish police expanded a manhunt today for a Moroccan national believed to be one of the perpetrators of twin terror attacks in Barcelona and another seaside resort that killed 14 and wounded around 100. With the country in shock after the carnage which saw two men deliberately ploughing vehicles into crowds of pedestrians, Madrid mulled raising the terror alert to the maximum in the world‚Äôs third tourism destination.

With investigators working round the clock to identify the network behind the bloodshed, police said they were hunting for 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub without confirming reports he was the driver who ploughed a van into pedestrians in Barcelona on Thursday.

"Verdict on Triple talaq historic, progressive, path-breaking: Jurists","Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said though the judgment had to be welcomed, it was only limited to triple talaq. (File/Photo) Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said though the judgment had to be welcomed, it was only limited to triple talaq. (File/Photo)

Legal luminaries on Tuesday hailed the Supreme Court verdict on the practice of triple talaq among Muslims, by terming it as ‚Äúhistoric, progressive and path-breaking‚Äù, which would restore the equality, dignity and respect of crores of women. They were also of the opinion that the verdict would protect the Muslim women, who could now march towards the path of progress and prosperity like any other citizen of India. This view was shared by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who had advanced the stand of the Narendra Modi government in the apex court, and senior advocate Soli Sorabjee.

Sorabjee even went to the extent of saying that instead of delivering a split verdict, the five judges should have come up with a unanimous judgment.

Kapil Sibal, the Congress leader who represented the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) before the five-judge constitution bench, told PTI that this was a ‚Äúdying‚Äù and ‚Äúsinful‚Äù practice.

Even the AIMPLB had agreed to suggest to the Qazis to grant the women the liberty to say ‚Äòno‚Äô to ‚Äòtalaq-e-biddat‚Äô at the time of the execution of the Nikahnama (marriage contract), he said, adding, ‚ÄúWe welcome the judgment in its entirety.‚Äù

Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said though the judgment had to be welcomed, it was only limited to triple talaq.

‚ÄúIt is a welcome judgment in a right direction, but it is limited to triple talaq, also called talaq-e-biddat.

‚ÄúIt does not cover all the forms of talaq like Hasan and Ahsan, which also could have been dealt with as the quest should be for a full-fledged gender upliftment. This is only a small step,‚Äù he said.

Attorney General K K Venugopal welcomed the verdict and praised his predecessor Rohatgi, saying the latter had done a ‚Äúcommendable job‚Äù in putting forward the stand of the Modi government, which had been vindicated by the apex court.

Rohatgi said, ‚ÄúThe judgment is a step towards achieving the ultimate goal of Uniform Civil Code.‚Äù

While Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand said the verdict ‚Äúspeaks volume about the progress of the nation‚Äù, senior advocate Aman Sinha, who is also a BJP spokesperson, said ‚Äúit would grant crores of Muslim women the right to lead life with dignity and respect ‚Äî what Prime Minister Narendra Modi had spoken about on Independence Day‚Äù.

So was the view of BJP MP and lawyer Meenakshi Lekhi, who said the ‚Äúpolitical will‚Äù of the NDA government had led to the verdict, otherwise the fate of the case could have been the same as that of the 1985 judgment in the Shah Bano case, when the then Congress government came up with a law to undermine the Supreme Court verdict to overwrite the maintenance issue for Muslim women.

A five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court, by a 3:2 majority, today ruled that the practice of divorce through triple talaq among Muslims was ‚Äúvoid, illegal and unconstitutional‚Äù.

When did the Centre recruit doctors in hospitals last? Delhi High Court asks,"Delhi High Court. (File/Photo) Delhi High Court. (File/Photo)

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday expressed dissatisfaction with the Centre‚Äôs report that the number of doctors in its hospitals had seen a massive increase in the past 5 years, and asked when was the last recruitment done? A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar asked the Centre to inform it since when the posts of doctors had been lying vacant. The court raised the questions after it was dissatisfied with the Centre‚Äôs report that there was massive increase in the number of doctors in its hospitals in the last five years. It, meanwhile, expressed displeasure over the government hiring the doctors on contractual basis.

It also sought to know the ‚Äúvariation/increase in the number of patients/doctors ratio as well as in the patients/other personnel ratio in the government hospitals‚Äù here from the date when these hospitals were constructed/taken over by the government of India.

‚ÄúThis information is vital for us to take any view with regard to the issues which are under our consideration,‚Äù it said.

The court asked the authorities to file a status report by September 25.

The observations came during the hearing of a plea initiated by the court on its own after perusing a news report on the rise in violent attacks on doctors.

The court had on May 3 initiated the PIL based on the report that doctors in public hospitals were being subjected to extreme violence.

Stressing the need to provide security and better facilities to doctors and patients, the bench had asked the authorities about the number of cases they had lodged in this regard and also the prosecution carried out.

On perusing the report which said that resident doctors of All India Institute of Medical Sciences have decided to take self-defence classes, the bench had observed ‚Äúthis needs to be taken care by the authorities and steps have to be taken in this regard‚Äù.

World XI to tour Pakistan after government approves ‚ÄòPresident level security‚Äô,"Pakistan recently hosted the PSL final in Lahore which featured international players, including former West Indies skipper Darren Sammy. (Source: File) Pakistan recently hosted the PSL final in Lahore which featured international players, including former West Indies skipper Darren Sammy. (Source: File)

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has confirmed that a World XI series will be held in Lahore after the Punjab Government gave its nod for ‚ÄòPresidential level security‚Äô for the tour. According to a Cricinfo report, the 15-man squad, featuring players from all top Test countries, will be in Dubai for a seven-day camp and will then head to Lahore for the three-T20 series starting September 10. Former Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower will be the coach of the side.

Shahryar Khan made a lot of efforts to get a green signal for this series. Giles Clarke, ECB president and chairman of ICC‚Äôs Pakistan Task Force, also played a major role in this project. The World XI team was picked by ECB director Flower. The tour has got full backing from the ICC and, according to PCB chairman Najam Sethi, the world body has been working closely with the PCB for ensuring security for the event. All the expenses of the tour will be borne by the PCB.

With Pakistan hoping to host Sri Lanka for a one-off T20I in September, Najam Sethi feels World XI series could encourage more countries to come to Pakistan.

After the attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in March 2009, only Zimbabwe and Afghanistan have toured Pakistan as the others have refused over security concerns. The major blow was not hosting 2011 World Cup which was scheduled to jointly held by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

Short tour by Zimbabwe in 2015 did revive international cricket in Pakistan but another bomb blast, 800m from Gadaffi system, did no good. After that, PCB hosted the PSL final in 2017 and overseas players, including former West Indies skipper Darren Sammy, featured in the fixture on March 5 in Lahore.

My outfits will never overpower my personality: Taapsee Pannu,"Taapsee Pannu says looking like a diva is not her aim and she will never let clothes define her personality. Taapsee Pannu says looking like a diva is not her aim and she will never let clothes define her personality.

She may be experimenting a lot with her fashion choices, but actor Taapsee Pannu says looking like a diva is not her aim and she will never let clothes define her personality. The 30-year-old star, who has lately been sporting edgy and out-of-the-box looks, says she does not go by the fashion trends and only wears clothes that she can manage easily.

In an interview, Taapsee says, ‚ÄúThe credit of dressing me up goes to my sister-in-law, Devki, who is also my stylist. She stays in the US and styles me from there. She is pharmacist by profession and does styling for fun. ‚ÄúI openly say that fashion is not my main aim. It is not

that I constantly follow what‚Äôs happening in the world in terms of fashion. But I believe if you know how to carry yourself and follow your own style, you become fashionable. Devki knows my style, she knows what suits me. (But) My outfits will never overpower my personality. They don‚Äôt define me, I define them.‚Äù

The actor says she loves dressing up for events and getting clicked, but the trend of the airport-gym looks have not gone down well with her. ‚ÄúPeople are after the airport look, gym look, etc. It bothers me a lot. If I am taking a 5 am flight, I can‚Äôt afford to look fashionable. I am not a hardcore fashion person. I have made peace with it. I have decided I will wear what I like and not care about what the fashion police has to say. Still, it does stress me out. But it is an occupational hazard. Nothing much can be done about it,‚Äù says Taapsee.

The ‚ÄúNaam Shabana‚Äù actor today walked the ramp at the Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 for designer Divya Reddy.

Taapsee slayed the runway in a floor-length embellished jacket worn over a delicately-embroidered sheer piece. The actor says walking the ramp has always been a nightmare for her, right from her modelling days. ‚ÄúI believe there are different expectations attached when you are a model and things are different when you are showstopper. When I used to model, I felt like a nameless body carrying clothes.

‚ÄúSo, now I really enjoy (it). I like the fact that a designer would create something for me or want me to represent their creation for the first time in front of the world. That makes me feel special. People will not look just at my clothes but also at my personality,‚Äù she adds.

Taapsee will next be seen in ‚ÄúJudwaa 2‚Äù. The movie, also featuring Varun Dhawan and Jacqueline Fernandez, will release on September 29.

"India‚Äôs June quarter GDP to see modest recovery at 6.6%, indicates Nomura","Economic activity in the country, which had lost some momentum in the run up to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, has started to recover. (File Photo) Economic activity in the country, which had lost some momentum in the run up to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, has started to recover. (File Photo)

India is expected to see a modest recovery in GDP growth at 6.6 per cent for the April-June quarter as compared to 6.1 per cent in January-March, which was affected by demonetisation, says a Nomura report. Economic activity in the country, which had lost some momentum in the run up to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, has started to recover, according to Nomura.

The report said while consumption and services growth indicators (especially transportation) bounced back in July, industry, investment and external sector data remain weak, or have slowed at the margin. However, a growth recovery is expected by year-end, aided by remonetisation and improved financial conditions. ‚ÄúGiven the impact of the GST and in line with our indicators, we expect only a modest recovery in GDP growth to 6.6 per cent year-on-year in Q2 (April-June) compared to 6.1per cent in January-March, which was affected by demonetisation. However, in the second half of 2017, we expect growth to accelerate sharply to 7.4 per cent,‚Äù it said in a research note. According to Nomura, both urban and rural consumption indicators bounced back in July. While, diesel consumption and consumer credit also picked up, confirming that underlying consumption demand is robust. However, there were weakness in investments, industry and external demand, it added.

On the monetary policy front, Nomura said the Reserve Bank of India is expected to stay on a prolonged pause. The Reserve Bank in its policy review meet this month has lowered its key lending rate by 0.25 per cent, a move which is likely to translate into lower interest rates for home, auto and other loans as also boost economic activity.

Mauritius face St Kitts and Nevis in second tri-nation game,"Led by skipper Kevin Bru, the Mauritian side would need to improve their defence. (Source: File) Led by skipper Kevin Bru, the Mauritian side would need to improve their defence. (Source: File)

After a 1-2 loss to hosts India, Mauritius face another higher-ranked side in St Kitts and Nevis in their second and final league match in the tri-nation tournament in Mumbai on Tuesday.

Mauritius coach Francisco Filho had said that he would like to see his team play an aggressive football like they had done against India in the first half of their match on Saturday, when they scored a goal in the 15th minute.

Ranked 160th in the FIFA chart, Mauritius also need to maintain the aggression and not provide an opportunity to their opponents to get into the game.

Led by skipper Kevin Bru, the Mauritian side would need to improve their defence, which was breached by the Indian side to net couple of goals.

The side mostly attacked the Indian goalpost from the left in their previous game and can adopt a similar approach in their second outing tomorrow.

South American side St Kitts and Nevis, who are 125th ranked in the FIFA chart, would like to start the tournament on a winning note before they play India on August 24.

Coached by Passy Jacques, they had registered a 2-1 win against Barbados in their last friendly in May.

Survivors picking through the debris of Sierra Leone‚Äôs deadly mudslides are facing the reality that most, if not all, of the estimated 600 people missing are dead. The death toll is already above 450 from the flooding and mudslides in the capital, Freetown, early Monday.

Large-scale-burials have begun amid rainy weather and the threat of further mudslides. Rescue officials have warned that the chances of finding survivors ‚Äúare getting smaller every day.‚Äù

The government in recent days has warned residents to evacuate a mountainside where a large crack has opened. Authorities have told local media that thousands of people live in areas at risk, and the main focus is making sure people leave before further disaster.

Bodies have been washing up on shore in the seaside city.

CSIR to help improve research infrastructure of Indian varsities,"When asked if Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) was a contender in the CSIR‚Äôs list of universities, the NCL director said, ‚ÄúThe university is in itself self sufficient though there are ongoing collaborations at various levels. When asked if Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) was a contender in the CSIR‚Äôs list of universities, the NCL director said, ‚ÄúThe university is in itself self sufficient though there are ongoing collaborations at various levels.

As it completes 75 years, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is planning to strengthen the infrastructural facilities of Indian universities in order to boost the research outside traditional laboratories. This was informed by A K Nangia, director of CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) and head of human resource development wing of CSIR, while speaking on the sidelines of the inaugural session of the five-day platinum jubilee celebrations of CSIR, that commenced in the city on Monday. Two more similar exhibitions, displaying the scientific works conducted during the past seven decades, will be showcased at Hyderabad and Kolkata in the coming days.

‚ÄúThere are universities that lack infrastructural facilities for undertaking scientific research. The aim is to identify such universities and help them build the required infrastructure,‚Äù explained Nangia. Another area where the council aims to work is to improve the strength of scientists working at its labs, for which they are planning to collaborate with universities. According to its latest plan, CSIR will offer to its own fellows working at the various universities access to lab and instrumentation facilities.

‚ÄúIn the beginning, the CSIR fellows will be brought under the scheme, during which they will be given access to use any CSIR lab for doing research. Researchers can also avail expert guidance from the scientists. This we hope to not just inspire but also identify talented people who can then be taken onboard to work with CSIR in future,‚Äù said Nangia.

When asked if Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) was a contender in the CSIR‚Äôs list of universities, the NCL director said, ‚ÄúThe university is in itself self sufficient though there are ongoing collaborations at various levels. The scheme will instead first cover universities in Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Solapur which are in urgent need of better infrastructural facilities and this gap needs to be addressed.‚Äù

Another pertinent issue which was discussed was the severe crunch in funds for performing fundamental research, particularly by the autonomous scientific institutions in the country. ‚ÄúAutonomous institutions are forced to manage with the already limited funds, a majority of which will be used for paying salaries as per the revised 7th pay scale. The finance ministry has been requested not to further cut any budgets and keep the steady flow of funds so that the scientific works are not hampered,‚Äù he informed.

Lottery workers protest GST in Mumbai,"‚ÄúPeople in the lottery industry, such as lottery owners, retailers and workers, all have come to the protest and this is in no way affiliated to any political party,‚Äù said Dhiraj Gawade, an organiser. (Representational Image) ‚ÄúPeople in the lottery industry, such as lottery owners, retailers and workers, all have come to the protest and this is in no way affiliated to any political party,‚Äù said Dhiraj Gawade, an organiser. (Representational Image)

Hundreds of lottery workers from across Maharashtra under the Lottery Bachao Mahakruti Samiti organised a demonstration at Azad Maidan on Monday to protest against the GST levied on lotteries. The agitators said they want the government to change the tax from the current 28 per cent to the 12 per cent that they used to pay earlier.

‚ÄúPeople in the lottery industry, such as lottery owners, retailers and workers, all have come to the protest and this is in no way affiliated to any political party,‚Äù said Dhiraj Gawade, an organiser. Snehal Shah, another organiser, said: ‚ÄúMany people across the lottery industry have lost their jobs and sales are down by almost 62 per cent. Everyone in the industry, from computer engineers to those printing media, who print tickets have lost jobs. If the tax is not changed, the industry in Maharashtra is in danger of becoming extinct.‚Äù

The organisation said its only demand is for the government to change the tax from the current 28 per cent to 12 per cent that was levied earlier. ‚ÄúThis is only the first step. If the government does not listen to our demands, we will sit in front of the Vidhan Sabha and ask every MLA and MP to listen to us. If even that does not work, we will march to Delhi.‚Äù said Shah.

Many workers have been affected under the new tax regime and several shop owners have had to shut down their business. Nandkishor Sagar (22) who hails from Aurangabad and used to a run a lottery shop said: ‚ÄúI used to run a shop and fund my studies through it. Because of the tax, my revenue has reduced from Rs10,000 a month to a mere Rs 2,000. It became unsustainable as the revenue had reduced but rentals and wages remained the same. I had to shut down the shop and now, it is becoming difficult to survive.‚Äù

Hemant Agarwal, 54, who owns Mangalmurti Lottery Centre in Panvel, sais: ‚ÄúYes, the revenue is down by 50 per cent. I used to sell my tickets at Rs 10 each but now, it sells at Rs 13. It may seem like a small jump but lottery tickets are not essential goods and they are often bought in bulk, which increases the price to an amount that few want to sp[end.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI have already had to let one of my employees go. If the situation does not change, it could lead to an more job loss.‚Äù

The protesters met Deepak Kesarkar, the Minister of State for Finance and Rural Development, to put forward their demands. Kesarkar said while the state government could not intervene in matters related to GST, it will put forth the demands of the Lottery Bachao Mahakruti Samiti to the central GST Council. The state government has begun a process to start an online lottery system.

"HC issues notice to Centre, Delhi Police on NEET investigation plea","High Court Monday issued notices to the Centre and Delhi Police on a plea seeking a court-monitored CBI/SIT probe into alleged illegalities in the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) held in 2016 for admitting students in postgraduate medical courses.

A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar also issued notice to the National Board of Examination (NBE), Medical Council of India, Prometrics Private Ltd and the CBI on a plea that sought to hand over the case to the probe agency. The court will take up the matter on September 10.

Prometrics had sub-contracted CMS IT Services Private Ltd to hire engineers, site supervisors and other staff to prepare exam labs for conducting NEET PG examination at 43 centres across the country.

In the plea filed by Dr Anand Rai, it was alleged Delhi Police had ‚Äúnot interrogated the candidates who have been named as beneficiaries as well as officers of M/s Prometrics and the National Board of Examinations‚Äù.

‚ÄúIn fact, even statements and evidence mentioned in the chargesheet have not been filed with the chargesheet in court. Such conduct in such a serious matter brings apprehensions of subversion of the course of justice whether with or without intent. Under these circumstances, court monitoring of such an investigation, preferably by a specially appointed SIT, becomes essential,‚Äù the plea states.

Seeking a court-monitored probe, the plea states that the Delhi Police chargesheet ‚Äúfalls short of explaining or investigating into the alleged tampering of the computer systems‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe Respondent No. 7 (Delhi Police) has not seized any of the computer systems used in the conduct NEET-PG, 2017 much less having the same forensically examined,‚Äù the plea states.

The plea also points out that one Rameshwar Mishra, who was interrogated by the police and mentioned as ‚Äúthe main conspirator‚Äù, has not been made an accused or a witness in the case.

"India vs Sri Lanka, 1st ODI: Sri Lanka interim coach Nic Pothas slams batsmen after collapse","Shikhar Dhawan feasted yet again at the expense of Sri Lankan bowlers. (Source: AP) Shikhar Dhawan feasted yet again at the expense of Sri Lankan bowlers. (Source: AP)

It has been a tough time of late for Nic Pothas, watching his charges go down almost without a fight in the Test series, and showing no sign of a turnaround in the first of five one-dayers. The interim coach was left fuming at the manner in which his batsmen wasted a good start to get bowled out for a woefully inadequate total. The Lankans were well placed at 139 for one but were bowled out for 216 runs, which India chased down in less than 29 overs.

‚ÄúWe were 139 for 1. Then we were 77 for nine. To lose nine wickets in 19 overs is in anyone‚Äôs language unacceptable. We‚Äôve got to take that on the chin as staff, as players, and that‚Äôs the reality of sport,‚Äù said Pothas. The batsmen mostly got out to soft dismissals, with part-timer Kedar Jadhav chipping in with two key wickets.

‚ÄúOnce again, you‚Äôve got to go to the individual. Our job as coaches is to put ammunition in the ammunition belt. Then it‚Äôs up to the player to make the decision based on his strengths, his reading of the conditions, and his reading of the opposition. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs obviously some that do it better. That‚Äôs true in every team around the world. Of course you‚Äôre going to get it wrong, but people nick half volleys and nick cuts,‚Äù Pothas said.

With only 216 runs to defend, the hosts were always up against it, particularly with a bowling attack lacking in penetration. On the top of that, the heavyweight Indian batting had been firing on all cylinders during the Test series. Shikhar Dhawan feasted yet again at the expense of the local bowlers, bringing up his third century of the tour, off just 71 deliveries. But the Sri Lanka coach stood by his bowlers in their hour of misery.

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs tough. We probably didn‚Äôt read the situation well enough. Yes, there were some execution issues as well. What we always try to drive home in the changing room is that ‚Äòif you make the right decision but don‚Äôt execute, we‚Äôre more than happy with that situation‚Äô. Today we were a little bit more on the making the wrong decisions side unfortunately,‚Äù the South African said. The past few weeks have been a nightmare for the team, Pothas believes his players will turn the corner sooner or later.

‚ÄúIt swings between hurt and embarrassment. Emotionally, you get angry. You get frustrated. Am I angry with the players? Absolutely not. The players work as hard as anyone can ask of them. They‚Äôve been superb. You can‚Äôt fault anyone within that changing room,‚Äù he added.

Confidence of Tomorrow,"An illustration from the book. An illustration from the book.

I want freedom from green vegetables; I want freedom from history class; I want to ask questions like I do in science class; to walk around the neighbourhood like I do on Eid‚Äù. These words could have been said by children anywhere in the world, but in the book My Sweet Home these are the words of children who led ordinary lives in and around Delhi‚Äôs Jamia Nagar, till Operation Batla House took place in September 2008. That changed everything for the 10-12 year olds.

Released at Jamia Millia Islamia University last week, the book (Niyogi Books; Rs 595) tours the neighbourhood of Okhla through the eyes of children, through food, parks and history. It is an outcome of a one-week workshop held in February 2010, with 20 students from two schools in Okhla (Urdu and Hindu medium), which are part of the University‚Äôs outreach programme.

Samina Mishra, documentary filmmaker and writer, wondered what it was to be a child in the locality surrounded by OB vans and policemen. The idea of the workshop grew from there, and Sherna Dastur, filmmaker and artist, came on board to provide the visual language. From words they moved to one-line sentences and from there to stories of their neighbourhood. The book, filled with both wit and paradox, makes the reader a flaneur, aware of how it resembles one‚Äôs own life.

‚ÄúWe wanted the children to freely express themselves with paint and colour, follow their heart and remember that the end result was unimportant. We started with several 10-minute colour sketches to explore simple themes of love and freedom. They could use only patches of colour, no hearts for love or birds or flags for freedom. As the workshop progressed, the exercises became more complex. We began looking at new ways in which they could imagine their surroundings, and the events that had shaped their lives. They made maps that not only represented places and events in their immediate neighbourhood, but also other places that mattered to them. There was a river near a grandmother‚Äôs house in Uttar Pradesh, a desire to go to Shimla, a heart operation, a samosa shop, and a fake encounter,‚Äù says Dastur.

In the book, Abeer, one of the students, writes: ‚ÄúI have lost a lot of things but I‚Äôve never regretted anything as much as the loss of my neighbourhood‚Äôs reputation. After the encounter, Batla House has got a bad name‚Äù. While Khushboo Khan, another student, writes: ‚ÄúThe boys who were killed were students. They were not terrorists. The police framed them, perhaps to become famous themselves‚Äù. Amid these emotions are stories of cats, markets, holidays and friendships.

‚ÄúIt was an artistic endeavour to understand the self and the world around, and find one‚Äôs connection through that. I wanted to bring out the complexities and love for the everyday,‚Äù says Mishra, adding, ‚ÄúSo there is a narration about mufflers, of cricket, nameplates and trees.‚Äù Taking off from some of these, Mishra has written three fictional stories that contextualise the drawings of the children.

Black-and-white photographs by artist-photographer Kunal Batra brings the textural elements of the streets into the book that is laden with Delhi, as a city that has been razed and rebuilt several times and contains within it stories of resurrection. This book is testimony to the hope that lies in children. Their neighbourhoods are not wastelands or centres of paralysis because of these fateful events ‚Äî instead, in the everyday, they find their identity.

Spain mourns attack victims as probe zeroes in on imam,"People stand next to candles and flower tributes placed on the ground after a terror attack that killed 14 people and wounded over 120 in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017.

Grief-stricken Barcelona paid homage on Sunday to victims of two terror assaults at a mass in the city‚Äôs Sagrada Familia church, as investigators turned their focus to a missing Moroccan imam believed to have radicalised the young attackers. King Felipe, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Catalonia‚Äôs president Carles Puigdemont led the ceremony mourning the 14 people killed by jihadists who used vehicles to mow down pedestrians in Barcelona‚Äôs Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday and in the nearby seaside resort of Cambrils early Friday.

‚ÄúThese have been days of tears, many tears,‚Äù said auxiliary bishop Sebastia Taltavull. Outside the church, snipers were posted on rooftops surrounding the landmark building by Gaudi, while heavily armed police stood guard as hundreds of people gathered under grey skies. Catalonia resident Teresa Rodriguez said she had turned up to pray for the victims.

‚ÄúWhat happened in Las Ramblas is really hard for us, we go for walks there often, it could have happened to me, my children or anyone. And here we are. It‚Äôs huge, huge,‚Äù she said as she fought back tears. Later on Sunday, nearly 100,000 people were expected at Barcelona‚Äôs Camp Nou stadium for their team‚Äôs first game of the season, to be marked by a minute of silence for the victims. Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said on Saturday the cell behind the carnage that also injured 120 had been ‚Äúdismantled,‚Äù although local authorities took a more cautious tone.

Police were still hunting 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub, who media reports say was the driver of a van that smashed into crowds on the popular Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday, killing 13 people. Hours later, there was a similar assault in the seaside town of Cambrils that left one woman dead. Police shot and killed the five attackers, some of whom were wearing fake explosive belts.

An extensive security operation including roadblocks was mounted overnight across Catalonia. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attacks, believed to be its first in Spain. The terror cell in Spain reportedly comprised at least 12 young men, some of them teenagers. Investigators are seeking to unravel the role of an imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, who is believed to have radicalised many of the youths from a small town called Ripoll, at the foot of the Pyrenees.

Several of the suspects ‚Äì including Abouyaaqoub ‚Äì grew up or lived in the town of about 10,000 inhabitants. On Saturday, police raided the imam‚Äôs apartment in Ripoll, his flatmate, who would only identify himself as Nourddem, told AFP. Spanish media quoting police sources, said the officers were looking for DNA traces in the apartment to compare with body parts found in an explosion in a home in Alcanar, about 200 kilometres (120 miles) south of Barcelona, where the alleged jihadists were believed to have been building bombs.

Exactly a year ago, Neymar had struck the winning penalty for Brazil to claim their first ever Olympic football gold medal as they defeated Germany at Rio‚Äôs Maracana stadium in front of the home crowd. Currently the most expensive player in the world, Neymar had fired the winning penalty into the top corner before breaking into tears.

So much has happened in the world of football since then including major developments in Neymar‚Äôs career. But he still cannot forget the moment he won gold for Brazil. In two Instagram posts, Neymar shared a video and a picture of himself on Sunday of the moment after the final.

Neymar remembers the moment when he won the Rio 2016 Olympics as Brazil‚Äôs captain, saying that he had several mixed feelings of wanting to scream, jump, run and celebrate with his ‚Äòcompanions‚Äô all at once.

He also posted an emotional video after the final penalty when they realised that they won Olympics 2016 football tournament. He is seen hugging his teammates and jumping out of joy in the video, which he posted with the caption, ‚ÄúAt that moment I had several mixed feelings, I wanted to scream, to jump, to run, to hug my companions, the people I love, I do not know ‚Ä¶ I wanted to do everything, but I could only cry ‚Ä¶ thank you God, for transforming our crying into joy.‚Äù

Kimi Raikkonen to drive again for Ferrari in 2018 F1 championship,"Kimi Raikkonen joined from McLaren in 2007, winning the drivers‚Äô title in his first year with Ferrari. (Source: Reuters) Kimi Raikkonen joined from McLaren in 2007, winning the drivers‚Äô title in his first year with Ferrari. (Source: Reuters)

Kimi Raikkonen will be racing for Ferrari again next season after the Italian Formula One team announced on Tuesday a contract extension with the Finn for 2018.

The popular 2007 world champion, who will be 38 in October, would have been out of contract at the end of this year with plenty of rivals eyeing up his seat at the sport‚Äôs most successful and glamorous team.

Raikkonen has not won a race since he was at Lotus in 2013, and is currently fifth in a championship led by German team mate Sebastian Vettel, who has won four of the season‚Äôs 11 races to date.

Vettel is also out of contract at the end of the season and the short Ferrari statement did not mention him. However, he is expected to remain once a longer and more lucrative deal has been hammered out.

The timing of Ferrari‚Äôs statement was earlier than expected, since the team have often made such announcements at their home Italian round at Monza which follows on from this weekend‚Äôs Belgian Grand Prix.

They had also been tipped to confirm both drivers at the same time.

Vettel, a four times world champion with Red Bull, has also been linked in some media speculation to champions Mercedes where Finland‚Äôs Valtteri Bottas has yet to be confirmed for 2018.

By opting to keep Raikkonen, Ferrari have gone for an experienced driver who is still quick and who will not rock the boat in what is likely to be his final season. He first raced for

Ferrari between 2007-9 and then returned in 2014.

He and Vettel get on well, with the German keen on him staying, and Raikkonen has shown his loyalty this season by accepting team orders to his detriment.

The Finn has twice finished second behind Vettel, in Monaco and Hungary, while also taking third place in Britain and Russia.

He started on pole position in Monaco in May, his first appearance at the front of the grid since June 2008, and has a strong track record at Belgium‚Äôs Spa-Francorchamps where he was won four times.

His future was called into question in July, however, when Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne called him ‚Äúa bit of a laggard‚Äù.

‚ÄúI think Kimi has got to show a higher level of commitment to the process,‚Äù he had told reporters at the Austrian Grand Prix.

Marchionne has also emphasised that he wants Vettel to stay.

"Rajasthan Royals want name change, Kings XI Punjab want to shift from Mohali","Rajasthan Royals had won the inaugural IPL season. (Express photo by A. Srinivas) Rajasthan Royals had won the inaugural IPL season. (Express photo by A. Srinivas)

Fresh from having served a two-year ban for their key officials‚Äô role in the IPL spot-fixing scandal, Rajasthan Royals have approached the BCCI with a unique request. It‚Äôs learnt that the franchise, which is officially owned by Jaipur IPL Cricket Private Limited, is keen on changing the name of the parent company.

The Royals are scheduled to return to the IPL next season, and the board feels this could be the first of their many requests as many in the BCCI are expecting them to go for a major revamp with a new team name and even shifting out of Jaipur. ‚ÄúThey have made the request but no reason has been given as to why they want to change the company name,‚Äù a BCCI official added. A move to call themselves something other than Rajasthan Royals, who won the inaugural IPL 9 years ago, could be an image-cleansing ploy following the bad press that had come their way in the wake of the suspension.

But their shifting base from Jaipur could depend on when the BCCI decides to lift the ban on the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA), which has stayed put ever since ousted IPL chairman Lalit Modi contested elections in the state a few years ago. Things have changed on that front with veteran politician CP Joshi having won the elections recently and Modi having bid adieu to cricket administration.

Kings want to move out of Mohali

Royals are not alone. Even Kings XI Punjab have gone ahead and requested the BCCI, not for the first time, about shifting from Mohali. The franchise has cited reasons such as lack of support from the state association and trouble with local authorities as the reasons for moving out. They have also complained about the lack of a fan base for the franchise in the city, which has allegedly resulted in paltry earnings for the franchise.

Team officials have insisted that there had been more gate money on offer when Kings XI Punjab played some of their ‚Äúhome‚Äù matches in Pune and Indore over the last two seasons. They also felt that there was more support and interest for the team in Indore. The issue is learnt to have come up before the committee of administrators (CoA) during their last meeting, and they have asked it to be tabled in the next IPL governing council meeting.

Kings XI Punjab was bought for $76 million in 2007 with Mohali as their official home base. According to some BCCI officials, the franchise might have to pay extra money to the board in order to have a new home. It‚Äôs also learnt that they will also have to change the name of their franchise if they shift base.

‚ÄúThey had bid for Mohali when the first-ever auction took place for IPL teams. So technically, if they want to change their base now, they will have to pay the BCCI. They have made this request earlier too but the board did not agree. The franchise has been facing many issues with the local police authorities. They have also cited lack of support from the Punjab Cricket Association. If they are allowed then chances are that their name will also change. It will be as per the new venue. The IPL GC will take a call on it,‚Äù a BCCI official told The Indian Express.

University of Texas removes Confederate statues,"Damage is seen to the face of a statue of Confederate commander General Robert E.

University of Texas President Greg Fenves has ordered the immediate removal of statues of Robert E. Lee and other prominent Confederate figures from a main area of campus, saying such monuments have become ‚Äúsymbols of modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism.‚Äù

Fenves announced the move late Sunday night as crews were in place to begin taking the statues down. The school also blocked off the area during the process, and the statues are expected to be gone by mid-morning Monday, a spokesman said.

The university moved a statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis from its perch near the campus clock tower to a history museum in 2015. Fenves now says statues of Lee, Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston and Confederate Postmaster General John H. Reagan, which were in the same area as Davis, also will be moved to the Brisco Center for American History on campus.

The school will also move a statue of former Texas Gov. James Stephen Hogg, which was commissioned at the same time as the others, a spokesman said. Hogg will get another place on campus.

The debate over public memorials for Confederate figures roared into national conversation last week after one person was killed and 19 injured when a car drove into a crowd of people in a clash between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.

‚ÄúLast week, the horrific displays of hatred at the University of Virginia and in Charlottesville shocked and saddened the nation. These events make it clear, now more than ever, that Confederate monuments have become symbols of modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism,‚Äù Fenves said in a statement.

Moving the Davis statue in 2015 was a much more deliberate effort. The Davis statue had long been a target of vandalism. Fenves convened a special task force to discuss its future after a shooting rampage by a white supremacist at a Charleston, South Carolina, church and ultimately decided it should come down.

Confederate groups tried to block the removal of the Davis statue and the Sons of Confederate Veterans sued to stop it, but a state district judge sided with the school.

The decision to take down the others came much quicker. Fenves said he spoke last week with student leaders, students, faculty members, staff members and alumni about what to do after the events in Virginia.

‚ÄúThe University of Texas at Austin is a public educational and research institution, first and foremost. The historical and cultural significance of the Confederate statues on our campus ‚Äî and the connections that individuals have with them ‚Äî are severely compromised by what they symbolize,‚Äù Fenves said. ‚ÄúErected during the period of Jim Crow laws and segregation, the statues represent the subjugation of African Americans. That remains true today for white supremacists who use them to symbolize hatred and bigotry.‚Äù

Former workers at US-owned miner Freeport Indonesia injured in clash with police,"Police talk with protesting workers of the Indonesian unit of the US mining giant Freeport McMoran Inc during a labour dispute in Timika, Papua, Indonesia August 19, 2017.

REUTERS/Muhammad Yamin

Hundreds of workers laid off by Freeport Indonesia clashed with security forces, injuring three, near the company‚Äôs mines in the eastern province of Papua on Saturday, company and union officials said. The Indonesian unit of U.S. mining giant Freeport McMoran Inc. has been embroiled in a labour dispute since May, when around 5,000 workers went on strike to protest against mass layoffs.

Freeport says the layoffs were triggered by unexpected revisions earlier this year in government rules on taxes and royalties. Police on Saturday fired warning shots in the air to disperse the crowd of ex-workers who were demanding their jobs back, blocking roads and setting trucks on fire. Union official Tri Puspital said police then fired into the crowd, injuring three. A national police spokesman declined to comment.

A spokesman for the company said the protests have not had an impact on operations, although employee access to worksites was being affected. ‚ÄúSome of our employee convoys have been cancelled and we will not be scheduling further convoys until the situation is conducive again. We have urged our workers to avoid this area until further notice,‚Äù said Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama. The company is a major source of employment and livelihoods in the impoverished eastern-most province of Indonesia.

"Turkish political refugees flock to Germany, seeking safety","In this Tuesday, May 23, 2017 photo, a young Turkish artist sits on a bench during an interview with The Associated Press in Berlin. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) In this Tuesday, May 23, 2017 photo, a young Turkish artist sits on a bench during an interview with The Associated Press in Berlin. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn)

The Turkish judge sits in a busy cafe in a big German city. Thirteen months ago, he was a respected public servant in his homeland. Now he is heartbroken and angry over the nightmarish turn of events that brought him here. The day after a 2016 coup attempt shook Turkey, he was blacklisted along with thousands of other judges and prosecutors. The judge smiles, sadly, as he recounts hiding at a friend‚Äôs home, hugging his crying son goodbye and paying smugglers to get him to safety.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very sad I had to leave my country,‚Äù he said, asking for his name and location to be withheld out of fear that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan‚Äôs government might track him down. ‚ÄúBut at least I‚Äôm safe and out of Erdogan‚Äôs reach. He cannot hurt me anymore.‚Äù

Germany has become the top destination for political refugees from Turkey since the failed July 15, 2016 coup. Some 5,742 Turkish citizens applied for asylum here last year, more than three times as many as the year before, according to the Interior Ministry. Another 3,000 Turks have requested protection in Germany this year.

The figures include people fleeing a long-simmering conflict in the Kurdish region of southeastern Turkey, but the vast majority belong to a new class of political refugees: diplomats, civil servants, military members, academics, artists, journalists and anti-Erdogan activists accused of supporting the coup.

With many of them university-educated and part of the former elite, ‚Äútheir escape has already turned into a brain-drain for Turkey,‚Äù said Caner Aver, a researcher at the Center for Turkish Studies and Integration Research in Essen. Germany is a popular destination because it‚Äôs already home to about 3.5 million people with Turkish roots and has been more welcoming of the new diaspora than other Western nations, Aver said.

‚ÄúSome of the highly qualified people also try getting to the U.S. and Canada because most speak English, not German. But it‚Äôs just much harder to get there,‚Äù Aver said. ‚ÄúBritain has always been popular, but less so now because of Brexit.‚Äù

Comparable figures for post-coup asylum requests from Turks were not available for other countries.

More than 50,000 people have been arrested in Turkey and 110,000 dismissed from their jobs for alleged links to political organizations the government has categorized as terror groups or to U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Ankara blames the Muslim cleric, a former Erdogan ally, for the coup attempt. Gulen denies the claim.

The true number of recent Turkish arrivals to Germany exceeds official asylum requests. Many fleeing academics, artists and journalists came on scholarships from German universities or political foundations. Some got in via relatives. Others entered with visas obtained before the failed coup.

The judge, a slim man in his 30s with glasses, arrived illegally by paying thousands of euros to cross from Turkey to Greece on a rubber dinghy and then continuing on to Germany. Two other Turks in Germany ‚Äî an artist who asked for anonymity, fearing repercussions for her family back home, and a journalist sentenced to prison in absentia ‚Äî also spoke of ostracism and flight.

Ismail Eskin, the journalist, left Turkey just before he was sentenced to 3¬Ω years in prison on terrorism-related charges. The 29-year-old worked for the Ozgur Gundem newspaper and the Kurdish news agency Dicle Haber Ajansi until the government shut them down shortly after the failed coup.

Eskin tried to write for different online news sites but the Turkish government blocked them too. He reluctantly decided to leave when the situation became unbearably difficult for journalists ‚Äî about 160 are now in jail.

‚ÄúI kept changing places to avoid being arrested, and I hid that I was a journalist,‚Äù Eskin said, chain-smoking at a Kurdish immigrants‚Äô center. He hasn‚Äôt applied for asylum but is studying German ‚Äî an acknowledgment he might be here to stay.

The judge said he ‚Äúnever supported any kind of coup‚Äù and had no connection to the Gulen movement but took hurriedly packed a few belongings and went to a friend‚Äôs place after learning he was among more than 2,000 judges and prosecutors being investigated. A few hours later, police searched his apartment and took his computer.

His wife and children had been out of town during the coup attempt. While he was in hiding, his wife was told she had 15 days to move out. Friends and relatives stopped talking to her. After several months, he chose to leave.

‚ÄúSince there‚Äôs no independent justice in Turkey anymore, I would have been exposed to injustice, maybe be tortured, if I had surrendered,‚Äù he said.

He sold his car and paid 8,500 euros ($9,910) to a smuggler for a December boat trip to a Greek island. From there, he flew to Italy and on to Germany. He brought his wife, son and daughter to join him a few weeks later.

The number of Turkish citizens fleeing to Germany has complicated the already tense relations between Ankara and Berlin. Accusing Germany of harboring terrorists, Turkey has demanded the extradition of escaped Turkish military officers and diplomats.

At least 221 diplomats, 280 civil servants and their families have applied for asylum, Germany says. Along with refusing to comply with the extradition requests, Germany has lowered the bar for Turkish asylum-seekers ‚Äî those given permission to remain increased from 8 percent of applicants last year to more than 23 percent in the first half of 2017.

Some Turkish emigres have started building new lives in exile. The artist from Istanbul lost her university job in graphic design before the 2016 coup because she was one of more than 1,000 academics who triggered Erdogan‚Äôs ire by signing a ‚Äúdeclaration for peace‚Äù in Turkey.

She went to Berlin on a university scholarship in September, not long after the attempted coup. In February, she discovered she‚Äôd been named a terror group supporter and her Turkish passport was invalidated.

‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm forced into exile, but that‚Äôs better than to be inside the country,‚Äù the woman in her early 30s said.

The artist said she‚Äôs doing fine in Berlin. She enrolled at a university and has had her work exhibited at a small gallery. Yet with her family still in Turkey, some days the enormity of the change weighs on her.

‚ÄúIn the winter I was so homesick,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI really felt like a foreigner, in my veins and in my bones.‚Äù

Prominent Indian-origin journalist Davan Maharaj ousted as Los Angeles Times editor,"Davan Maharaj. (Source: LA Times) Davan Maharaj. (Source: LA Times)

A prominent journalist of Indian-descent has been fired as the editor of the Los Angeles Times after serving 28 years at the news organisation, as part of a significant shake-up of the American daily‚Äôs top management. Davan Maharaj, who served as both editor and publisher since 2016, was terminated along with other senior editors of the daily. ‚ÄúMaharaj was terminated along with a handful of other senior editors, including Managing Editor Marc Duvoisin, Deputy Managing Editor for Digital Megan Garvey and Assistant Managing Editor of Investigations Matt Doig,‚Äù a report in the LA Times said.

A native of Trinidad, Maharaj began his journey at the paper as a summer intern in 1989 and worked as a reporter in Orange County, Los Angeles and East Africa. He had later served as assistant foreign editor, business editor and managing editor. A six-part series ‚ÄòLiving on Pennies‚Äô done by Maharaj in collaboration with photographer Francine Orr, won the 2005 Ernie Pyle Award for Human Interest Writing and prompted readers to donate tens of thousands of dollars to support aid agencies in Africa. While Maharaj was editor, The Times won three Pulitizer Prizes, including for breaking news reporting of the 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino.

‚ÄúDuring the last 28 years, it has been an honour working with the best journalists in a great American newsroom,‚ÄùMaharaj said in an email, quoted in the LA Times report. ‚ÄúThey are indomitable, and I wish them well in their continued fight to serve our community. I‚Äôm proud of the workwe‚Äôve done,‚Äù he added. Ross Levinsohn, a veteran media executive who worked at Fox and had served as interim chief of Yahoo, was named publisher and chief executive of the 135-year-old LA Times. Jim Kirk, who was publisher and editor of the Chicago Sun-Times until last week, was named interim editor. The move was announced by Justin C Dearborn, chief executive of Tronc, the parent company of The Times and eight other daily newspapers as part the organisation‚Äôs plans toinvest more resources towards ushering it into the digital age.

The report added that the shake-up came just one month after an investigative report was published in The Times that revealed that the former dean of the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine had partied with a prostitute and drug dealers, including on campus. Some reporters who had worked on the project approached senior corporate management to express concern that Maharaj and Duvoisin had delayed the story for fear of upsetting USC,which hosts the newspaper‚Äôs annual Festival of Books. Maharaj and Duvoisin had defended the handling of the story, noting that sensitive and complicated articles take months to report, edit and legally review, the report added.

IBPS PO 2017: Successful candidates share their exam strategy,"The preliminary IBPS PO exam will be held on October 7, 8, 14 and 15 2017 The preliminary IBPS PO exam will be held on October 7, 8, 14 and 15 2017

IBPS has started the registration for the probationary officer recruitment on its official website. This year, IBPS has announced 3562 vacancies for PO. To help you prepare better for the exam, we take preparation tips from previous years‚Äô IBPS exams toppers. This would be extremely helpful for you as it would enable you to check your preparation and see what you‚Äôre doing right and what you can do better. So without much ado, here are the tips:-

Math can be the most calculative and time taking section of the exam. We need to be really quick with our calculations. I suggest learning two systems ‚Äì (Trachtenberg System of mathematics and Vedic Maths). Your success in achieving quick and correct answers will be decided by how much part of the calculation you can do in your mind. If you are going to put every calculation on the paper, it‚Äôll increase the time taken by manifold. Practice calculating in your mind to the maximum extent possible.

I believe solving puzzles are the best way to practice reasoning questions as it‚Äôs fun. But also, one should practice textbook questions as we need to take care of Exam Context. Focus more on Verbal Reasoning as we can see a large number of questions these days from that portion.

‚Äì Neeraj Agrawal, Cleared IBPS PO 2016

Be prepared for the worst. After giving their mocks, I used to think that I could not even come near the cutoff in the actual exam. But only after being prepared for the worst, I could clear the exams with flying colours.

My strategy for this section was to practice as much as I could. Because even after solving 100‚Äôs of puzzles, one might not crack it in the paper, but that extra bit of practice in this section really helps speed up the thought process. Exam patterns are changing drastically. So, going online and searching for questions of different types would definitely help you score better.

Anyone preparing for the verbal / English section must start with basics, and the book I studied was Wren and Martin. It really helped me a lot. I also made sure there was a daily addition of at least 10 words to my vocabulary so that till the exam came, I had a huge number of words in my vocabulary. And daily reading (anything) would help in solving reading comprehensions. In my opinion it‚Äôs pretty much the most effective way of preparing for RCs. ‚Äì Chirag Gera, Cleared IBPS PO 2016 & IBPS Clerk 2016

Have faith in yourself, try to work on your weakest section and improve in that section, never get scared of a particular section because in most of the exams nowadays you need to clear all the sections not the total overall score. ‚Äì Md. Intshamuddin, Cleared IBPS RRB PO 2016

Develop a habit of reading more because that will help you in comprehension, para jumbles or any other new question that the IBPS decides to throw your way. For vocabulary and reading comprehension you must try to learn 10 new words daily. (Use picture-attaching-technique, so that you can retain that word for a longer time.)

Allot the quantity of work along with quality of work to be achieved in a single day. Gradually keep increasing the work and in some time studying for more hours will not be a scary thing, as the motivation will come from inside. ‚Äì Ashutosh Sharma, Cleared IBPS PO 2016

"Barcelona deserve much better directors, says Neymar","Neymar netted twice in PSG‚Äôs 6-2 hammering of Tolouse. (Source: AP) Neymar netted twice in PSG‚Äôs 6-2 hammering of Tolouse. (Source: AP)

Neymar has slammed FC Barcelona‚Äôs club directors following his home debut for Paris Saint Germain (PSG) in a 6-2 thrashing of Tolouse at Parc des Princes. He had moved to the Parisian side in the summer in a blockbuster 222 million Euros move from the Catalan giants.

‚ÄúI want to speak the truth, I‚Äôm very sad with them,‚Äù said the Brazilian star . ‚ÄúI spent four years there and I was very happy. At the start, I was happy. I spent four beautiful years there and I parted happy. But with them (the club‚Äôs directors), no. For me, they are not the people who should be there, for the direction of Barca. Barca deserve much better and the whole world knows it.‚Äù

The Catalan giants for all their added financial might, resources and world beating talent at their disposal, have been unable to find a suitable replacement for Neymar. The transfer window closes on August 31.

Barcelona have made multiple bids to bring in another Brazilian in Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool by bidding over 100 million Euros but have been turned down each time. They have also looked at Borussia Dortmund‚Äôs Ousmane Dembele and have seen disappointment there too.

Meanwhile the club have been criticised for splashing out 40 million euros midfielder Paulinho, who has spent two years at Chinese Super League champions Guangzhou Evergrande. The former Spurs flop has not been warmly received by the Barcelona fans. More than 80 per cent of the fans said the club should not pay more than 20 million euros for Paulinho as per a survey conducted by Barcelona sports daily Mundo Deportivo.

Neymar, however, said he can‚Äôt comment on Barcelona‚Äôs transfer affairs now. ‚ÄúI cannot speak now I am in another team. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on there, but I see my old teammates sad, and it‚Äôs that which makes me sad because I have a lot of friends there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI hope that things will improve for Barca and that they will become a team that can rival others.‚Äù

Dark Eden,"Title: Swarga Author: Ambikasuthan mangad

Publication: Juggernaut

256 pages

Swarga is an ambitious attempt to fictionalise an ecocide that has been unravelling in Kasaragode district in Kerala for many years. Thousands of people, particularly children, have been afflicted by a host of debilitating diseases, that are blamed on the aerial spraying of Endosulphan, a pesticide, in cashew plantations ringing the Kasaragode ghats. The public debates triggered by the tragedy has raised fundamental questions about modern agricultural practices and the responsibility of public institutions towards citizens. Endosulphan spraying was banned in 2000 and reports from the region point to the regeneration of local flora and fauna that had disappeared when pesticide use was rampant in large government-plantations.

Swarga, first published to much acclaim in Malayalam as Enmakaje in 2009, tells the story of the villagers of Swarga, Enmakaje and many other such hamlets who fought the PCK, which meant the state itself. The novelist, Ambikasuthan Mangad, however, has sought to turn what could have been a dry, grim catalogue of data and protests into an epic about modern man‚Äôs search for meaning in a technology-mediated world of consumption.

His narrators are a couple who, disgusted with urban life, have taken refuge in the forests of the Jadadhari hill in the shadow of which lies Swarga. Mangad calls them the Man and the Woman, since the two had decided to strip themselves of their past, identities and memories, when they left the city to retire to the jungle. Their attempt to reject an anthropomorphic worldview and journey back to a life in nature almost becomes a parable of the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, retracing the steps back to the Garden of Eden. When the woman ‚Äî her name, we are told later, is Devayani ‚Äî returns home with an orphan, the Man revolts. However, the baby, who turns out to be a stunted child, exposes them to the world beyond their Eden.

It is a world of a people, whose ancestors had sinned against nature and built a society of exploitation. The couple joins the struggle launched by a visiting activist, a local doctor and a journalist to bring justice to the people. The novel ends with a manipulative politician attacked by a golden serpent, who had worked against the interests of the people, and the couple, Devayani and Neelakantan, finding their awakening in a cave in the Jadadhari hill.

The patches, where Mangad tries to sketch a life for the couple in the city, jars the narrative. Blame it on the activist self of Mangad, parts of the novel assume a didactic tone which disturbs the philosphical armature he seeks for the subject. These anomalies, however, do not detract from the novel‚Äôs importance as flagging a seminal issue of our time: How best do we build our lives without violating the basic tenets of life itself.

Realising that the most vulnerable section of women often cannot reach the state women commission in Mumbai, the government has initiated an ‚Äòat your door‚Äô campaign to reach out to various districts and allow women to file complaints of domestic violence, sexual harassment, trafficking, abuse which will be tackled in a single-day hearing near their home.

On August 19, Women and Child Development (WCD) district officer, women commission chairperson, district police, lawyers and counsellors attended 60 complaints in a single hearing in Kolhapur from four districts‚Äî Satara, Sangli, Solapur, and Kolhapur. Of these, at least 25 were fresh complaints that women had filed on the spot.

‚ÄúGoing to home districts of complainants ensures each party is available. Not every one can travel long distances to Mumbai for multiple hearings. Some times, in the absence of one party, the case is delayed,‚Äù said Vijaya Rahatkar, chairperson of Maharashtra State Commission for Women.

In Kolhapur, the commission was able to resolve four complaints, where couples wanted a divorce and had approached the panel for it. Counselors took intensive sessions on Saturday to help the four couples reconcile. In other cases, officials said, the complaints had come against police inaction towards complaints of women and of domestic violence.

‚ÄúNotices and orders have been issued in 56 cases and legal aid has been given in cases where it was needed. Some cases may be taken up for further hearing,‚Äù an official from Maharashtra State Commission for Women said.

On Tuesday, another hearing is scheduled in Pune where 38 complaints registered with the commission will be heard. In Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Solapur, 1,500 government officials have been trained under a program called People United Against Sexual Harassment (PUSH) to understand the Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act and role of internal complaint committee in a corporate hierarchy.

The British Library is digitising rare printed Bengali books,"To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo) To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo)

The British Library, which is leading an international partnership to digitise rare material from its South Asian printed book collection, has scanned 1,000 old and rare printed Bengali books of the 19th century, according to project co-ordinators.

As part of the ‚ÄòTwo Centuries of Indian Print‚Äô (TCIP) project, in total, 4,000 early printed Bengali books, amounting to more than 800,000 pages, will be digitised and made freely available online.

‚ÄúSo far we scanned 1,000 books. There are books literally from every discipline you could think of. There are treatises on sciences, education, religion, missionaries coming to India and translation of the Bible,‚Äù Tom Derrick, Digital Curator, TCIP told IANS here at the Jadavpur University on the sidelines of a symposium exploring the history of print in South Asia.

The TCIP pilot project is a partnership between the British Library, the School of Cultural Texts and Records (SCTR) of Jadavpur University, Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, and the Library at SOAS University of London, involving collaborations with the National Library of India.

It marks the start of a major programme to share the wealth of Indian printed books held by the British Library dating from 1713 to 1914. Another aspect to the project is applying OCR (optical character recognition) to transcribe the Bengali script. OCR is the recognition of printed or written text characters by a computer.

‚ÄúWe are dealing with historical Bangla and the changes in the language, so the typography is unique. It is underserved by commercial OCR whose focus is more on Western patterns,‚Äù explained Derrick.

To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. ‚ÄúSo over 20 institutes worldwide have signed up,‚Äù he said. According to Layli Uddin, project curator (Bengali) at the British Library, the approach is three-pronged: cataloguing, digitising and contextualising.

‚ÄúWe want to reach out to a wider audience, make the materials open and free to all, make it accessible to non-Bengali speaking audiences as well. Also to contextualise and that is where the Jadavpur University experts come in. They are helping identify what is unique and rare in BL‚Äôs collectionsa printed materials which are not available elsewhere in the world,‚Äù Uddin told IANS.

Abhijit Gupta, joint director, SCTR, says the the thinner the book, the rarer they are.

‚ÄúThe British Library used a unique mechanisma they used to bind together thin books to preserve them. One of the rare books that is part of the project is ‚ÄòAdvice for Railway Travellers‚Äô which gives information on railway schedule after the advent of railways. The point of digitising is to access part of the landscape which we know exists but we can‚Äôt seea they are in libraries across the world.‚Äù added Gupta.

The talented Spaniard Marcos Alonso scored twice to hand Chelsea their first win of the season, despite a tough fight by Tottenham and an own goal by Mitchy Batshuayi, that equalised the match 1-1 with six minutes of the match remaining.

Twiterrati reacted to the exciting match that saw two stunning goals from Alonso. Here are the best reactions:

(Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)

In the wake of Gorakhpur hospital tragedy that left over 70 children dead due to alleged shortage of oxygen supply, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday directed registration of an FIR against BRD Medical college principal and five others, ANI reported. The decision was taken after a high-powered committee headed by Chief Secretary Rajiv Kumar submitted its report before the chief minister earlier in the day.

On August 12, CM Adityanath had said the committee would probe the tragic incident that took place in a span of about a week. BRD medical college principal had also been suspended with immediate effect in the aftermath of the tragedy. ‚ÄúA high-level probe under the chief secretary has been ordered, whose report will be obtained at the earliest, and accordingly stringent action will be initiated against the guilty. Till then for the irresponsible act, we are suspending the principal of BRD Medical College with immediate effect,‚Äù UP Medical Education Minister Ashutosh Tandon had told reporters on the same day.

In a related development, a three-member team of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) had accused the administration of negligence, saying no alert was issued regarding the shortage of oxygen. The IMA had said the treating doctors should have alerted seven days in advance that oxygen supply was not being received.

Facing intense scrutiny from the Opposition, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government dismissed the ‚Äúshortage of oxygen supply‚Äù as the cause of the tragedy and maintained that the children died due to different illnesses, including Japanese Encephalitis.

Most Americans say US shouldn‚Äôt threaten North Korea with military action,"However, if the US fails in its effort to solve North Korea nuclear issue diplomatically, 58 per cent of Americans say that they would approve of military action against North Korea. (Source: AP) However, if the US fails in its effort to solve North Korea nuclear issue diplomatically, 58 per cent of Americans say that they would approve of military action against North Korea. (Source: AP)

A majority of Americans say that the US should not threaten the North Korea with military action, according to a new poll. Nearly six in ten Americans say that the US should not threaten North Korea with military action, while 33 per cent say that military threats should be issued toward North Korea, said the CBS News poll.

Opinions differ largely by party, the poll also found, with 82 per cent Democrats saying the US should not and 63 per cent of Republicans saying the US should threaten with military action, Xinhua news agency reported.

However, if the US fails in its effort to solve North Korea nuclear issue diplomatically, 58 per cent of Americans say that they would approve of military action against North Korea.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reaffirmed on Thursday that diplomatic effort was ‚Äúfirst and foremost‚Äù choice in solving the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.

‚ÄúIn cooperation with other nations, we will continue to employ diplomatic and economic pressure to convince North Korea to end its illegal nuclear and ballistic missile program,‚Äù said Tillerson here at a joint press conference with visiting Japanese officials.

‚ÄúWe continue our full-out efforts, working with partners, working with allies to bring that pressure,‚Äù he added.

However, Tillerson warned that though not ‚Äúour preferred pathway,‚Äù the US is ‚Äúprepared militarily‚Ä¶ with our allies to respondent, if that is necessary‚Äù.

Syrian President Bashar Assad rejects security cooperation with the West,"Syrian President Bashar Assad. (File/Photo) Syrian President Bashar Assad. (File/Photo)

Syrian President Bashar Assad refused any security cooperation with Western nations or the reopening of their embassies, until they cut ties with opposition and insurgent groups. Shortly after Assad gave his speech on Sunday, a shell hit the first international fair in the country since the war began six years ago, killing and wounding several people. Assad‚Äôs defiant comments come at a time when his troops and pro-Iranian militiamen are gaining ground across the country under the cover of Russian airstrikes. Many countries have ceased calling for him to step down.

Speaking before dozens of Syrian diplomats in Damascus, Assad praised Russia, Iran, China and Lebanon‚Äôs Hezbollah for supporting his government during the conflict.

He said Syria will look east when it comes to political, economic and cultural relations.

‚ÄúThe direct support of our friends, politically, economically and militarily, made our advance on the ground greater and the losses of war less. Therefore, they are our partners in these achievements on the road to crush terrorism,‚Äù Assad said.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be clear. There will be no security cooperation nor opening of embassies or even a role for some countries that say that they want to play a role in ending the crisis in Syria before they clearly and frankly cut their relations with terrorism,‚Äù Assad said. ‚ÄúAt that point maybe we can speak about opening embassies.‚Äù

The Syrian crisis began in March 2011 with a peaceful uprising against Assad‚Äôs government, later escalating into a full-fledged civil war after a brutal government crackdown and the rise of an armed insurgency. The conflict has since killed an estimated 400,000 people and displaced half the country‚Äôs population.

In the early years of the conflict, many Western and Arab countries called on Assad to step down, and both the U.S. and the European Union have imposed sanctions on his government. Several Arab and Western countries also withdrew their diplomats from Damascus.

But after the Islamic State group declared a caliphate in large parts of Syria and Iraq, the international focus turned to crushing the extremists, who have planned attacks around the world that killed and wounded hundreds of people.

The Syrian president said his country‚Äôs economy is turning to growth again ‚Äúat a very slow pace, although we are under an almost complete embargo.‚Äù

Assad said that hardly a week passes without an attack in the West, referring to assaults carried out by IS supporters. ‚ÄúThese facts are what forced them (the West) to change their stance,‚Äù Assad said.

He welcomed recent deals to de-escalate violence in Syria, but vowed not to give the opposition in politics what it failed to gain through arms.

The de-escalation zones in central, northern and southern Syria were proposed in a plan approved in May by Russia, Turkey and Iran in the Kazakh capital, Astana. The plan included a cessation of hostilities, a halt to Syrian government air raids over designated areas, and provisions for humanitarian aid access.

Despite that deal, Assad said Syrians don‚Äôt trust Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and that the Syrian leader does not consider him to be a guarantor. Erdogan‚Äôs government is a main backer of Syrian rebels, and sent troops into Syria a year ago to battle IS and to halt the advance of Kurdish forces. Those troops, and allied Syrian forces, now control a stretch of Syrian territory along the border.

‚ÄúAny Turkish citizen who is in Syria without permission from the Syrian government will be considered an occupier,‚Äù Assad said.

Northwestern University professor and Oxford staffer extradited to Chicago in stabbing case,"Wyndham Lathem arrives at a police station as he is escorted by Chicago police on Saturday in Chicago. (AP Photo) Wyndham Lathem arrives at a police station as he is escorted by Chicago police on Saturday in Chicago. (AP Photo)

Two employees of elite universities charged in the fatal stabbing of a 26-year-old hair stylist were returned to Chicago early Saturday to face charges of first-degree murder in the brutal killing. Chicago police escorted fired Northwestern University professor Wyndham Lathem, 43, and Oxford University financial officer Andrew Warren, 56, from Northern California, where they surrendered peacefully on Aug. 4 after an eight-day, nationwide manhunt.

The men are accused of killing Trenton James Cornell-Duranleau, a Michigan native who had been living in Chicago, last month in Lathem‚Äôs high-rise Chicago condo. They may appear in court in Chicago as early as Saturday. Chicago police have said Cornell-Duranleau suffered more than 40 stab wounds, including ‚Äúmutilations,‚Äù to his upper body. Authorities say the attack was so violent the blade of the knife they believe was used was broken.

They found Cornell-Duranleau‚Äôs body July 27 after the building‚Äôs front desk received an anonymous call that a crime had occurred on the 10th floor. He had been dead more than 12 hours. By then, authorities say Lathem and Warren had fled the city. According to autopsy results released Friday by the Cook County medical examiner‚Äôs office, Cornell-Duranleau had methamphetamine in his system at the time of his death.

Police say Lathem and Cornell-Duranleau, who moved to Chicago about a year ago, had a personal relationship, though they have not described the nature of it or a motive for the attack. It‚Äôs unclear what the relationship was between Lathem, Cornell-Duranleau and Warren, who‚Äôs British. He arrived in the U.S. three days before the killing, after being reported missing in Great Britain.

Lathem, a microbiologist who‚Äôs been on Northwestern‚Äôs faculty since 2007 but was not teaching at the time of the attack, was terminated by the university for fleeing from police when there was an arrest warrant out for him.

Investigators said at some point after the killing, Lathem sent a video to friends and relatives apologizing for his involvement in the crime, which he called the ‚Äúbiggest mistake of my life.‚Äù The video raised concern among investigators that Lathem might kill himself.

Lathem and Warren both appeared in court in California last week, where they agreed to return to Illinois to face charges. An attorney for Lathem, Kenneth H. Wine, called him a ‚Äúgentle soul‚Äù and said ‚Äúwhat he is accused of is totally contrary to the way he has lived his entire life.‚Äù Wine said Lathem intends to plead not guilty to the charges.

Warren was represented by a public defender during a brief appearance in a San Francisco court. She said he is ‚Äúpresumed innocent,‚Äù but declined to comment further.

"Paper Miracles: Sanjhi, the ancient art of hand cutting stencils from paper, gets a contemporary twist in an exhibition","Works from the exhibition ‚ÄúSanjhi Revisted‚Äù Works from the exhibition ‚ÄúSanjhi Revisted‚Äù

After many requests from curious onlookers, a fourth generation Sanjhi artist ‚Äî Mohan Kumar Verma from Mathura ‚Äî cuts a bird with flared wings taking flight. He does it with the help of handmade scissors and a tiny sheet of plucked paper with lightning fast speed. ‚ÄúThis is all that I learnt from our grandfather. I‚Äôd lost my father and needed to support my family financially while other children of my age studied,‚Äù says the 48-year-old artist, who was showcasing the art of Sanjhi and depicting his works in the exhibition ‚ÄúSanjhi Revisited‚Äù at Delhi‚Äôs Visual Arts Gallery, India Habitat Centre. The exhibition has been brought together by Delhi Crafts Council to celebrate their golden jubilee year. Over 80 artwork on display include depiction of domes flanked by minarets, decorated with designs of weeping willow, as clouds resembling Aladdin‚Äôs magical lamp hover from above. There is also a reinterpretion of Mughal garden illustrations from Good Earth‚Äôs coloring book Bagh-e-Bahar by another Sanjhi artist, Ashutosh Verma.

Sanjhi, the art of handcutting stencils from paper, is believed to have emerged over a 100 years ago as part of ritual decorations in the temples of Mathura and Vrindavan. The stencils depicting legends and pilgrimage locations associated with the life of Krishna are used to create intricate floor patterns or rangoli using coloured powder.

Purnima Rai, head of the organising committee and former President of Delhi Crafts Council, says, ‚ÄúWith architecture as one of the many themes in the exhibition, the artists have portrayed buildings used in traditional Sanjhi, and reproduced several other architectural designs. Art is currently in a flux and its various possibilities need to reach out to more people. This show is a step in that direction.‚Äù

With the help of handmade paper, banana rice paper and jute paper, Mohan has replicated Mughal jali works inspired by the designs found in classic Mughal architecture, against the backdrop of a mirror. Artist Ram Soni has extensively cut out a series of illustrations of vases, spilling with flowers, out of silver foil, displayed against a deep blue colored backdrop. In Bamboo with Parrots, Soni has captured a parrot in a variety of postures while sitting atop a stylised bamboo tree ‚Äî looking up at the sky and into the oblivion, searching for food and engaging with its counterpart.

As the craft enveloped into a declining phase in the early 20th century, where only a few temples in Vrindavan practiced it, the efforts of designers and NGOs including Delhi Crafts Council in recent decades have ensured a resurgence of the craft. Mohan says, ‚ÄúAlmost 25 years ago, when I was invited at the National Crafts Museum in Delhi to display my products, no one was really willing to buy them. Even if a sheet of artwork paper was priced for Rs 100, people would question us and ask why it deserved to be sold at such a high price. It was demotivating and I had almost thought of quitting the profession. But as Delhi Crafts Council pushed us to bring in modern interpretations on coasters, lamps and wedding invitation cards, our craft flourished.‚Äù Mohan points out that he had even designed an entire wedding tent using Sanjhi art in Delhi and a pandal for Durga Puja in Kolkata a few years ago, where the exteriors of the pandal and the jewellery and clothing of the goddess was made of paper cut stencils. With most of the pieces at the exhibition now bearing a circled red mark and few works priced over a lakh, they only serve as a positive sign of a brighter future for the ancient artform.

The exhibition is on at Visual Arts Gallery, India Habitat Centre, Lodhi Road, till August 12

Diet tips: The right food habits during monsoon,"Non-vegetarians should go in for lighter meat preparations like stew and soups during the rainy season. Non-vegetarians should go in for lighter meat preparations like stew and soups during the rainy season.

Rainy Season is when chances of stomach infection can increase due to faulty eating habits. One can reduce the chances of such health complications easily by making a few alterations to their daily diet, says experts.

Mehar Rajput, Nutritionist and Dietitian at FITPASS, and Aditi Sharma, Chief Dietitian at Columbia Asia Hospital, Ghaziabad, dole out tips on how one can take care of infection:

* Include garlic, pepper, ginger, asafoetida, jeera powder, turmeric and coriander in food as it help enhance digestion and improve immunity.

* Should prefer boiled water during rainy season because germs are present in water. Have medium to low salt food and avoid heavy salty food as they are responsible for high blood pressure, promoting bloating and water retention.

* Non-vegetarians should go in for lighter meat preparations like stew and soups. But be careful about the fish and prawns. Avoid too much of fish and meat this season with heavy curries.

* Include warm dal or soup in your diet. Add spices like turmeric, clove, black pepper and sauf in it.

* Consuming hot soups during monsoon can reduce inflammation and help fight infection.

* Avoid taking food and vegetables in raw form. Like raw sprouts, they can cause indigestion and lead to gastric problems.

* Turmeric is not only a great antibiotic but is also known to have anti-inflammatory and healing properties which can really help in reducing inflammation in the digestive system.

* Sauf water can be consumed after every meal in order to help you digest food and reduce the chances of gastric problems.

Former European champion Velichko Cholakov dies at 35,"Bulgaria‚Äôs former European weightlifting champion Velichko Cholakov, who served a four-year ban for doping, died on Sunday at the age of 35. A hospital official in the southern town of Smolyan confirmed Cholakov‚Äôs death and said the cause would only be known after an autopsy.

Members of Cholakov‚Äôs family told local media he had recently been suffering with heart problems. A number of Bulgarian weightlifters have died at young ages.

Bulgaria‚Äôs 2004 Olympic weightlifting champion Milen Dobrev died two years ago at the age of 35, while three-times weightlifting world champion Mihail Petrov passed away at the age of 28 in 1992.

Cholakov was among the 11 members of the Bulgarian team that failed doping tests before the start of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. That led to the withdrawal of the whole team from the Games.

At 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 metres), Cholakov, who also won the silver medal in the over 105 kg-category at the world championships in 2003 and Olympic bronze in Athens a year later, was one of the tallest lifters of all time.

After serving a four-year doping ban, he obtained Azerbaijani citizenship and was set to compete for the oil-rich country at the 2012 Olympics in London but withdrew before the competition due to health issues.

Bulgarian weightlifters have won 12 Olympic titles and 36 medals in total, making it one of the most successful Olympic sports in the country.

"Substitutes can play an important role in last few minutes of the match, says Pep Guardiola","Manchester City will be up against Everton at the Etihad stadium on Monday. (Source: Reuters) Manchester City will be up against Everton at the Etihad stadium on Monday. (Source: Reuters)

Manchester City will be up against Everton at the Etihad stadium on Monday. Ahead of the game, City boss Pep Guardiola said that for the club to win the title, the substitutes will play an important role, which can also help the club to clinch victories in last few minutes of the match.

‚ÄúWhen the game is in the last 15 or 20 minutes, the opponent is tired and we‚Äôve moved them during the game, and we can put in dynamic players‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a point where we can win games in the last minutes.‚Äù, Guardiola told British media.

City‚Äôs new signings of Bernardo Silva and Olarenwaju Kayode have added more strength to their attacking line-up. The club already has top-notch players like Sergio Aguero, Gabriel Jesus, Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva and Leroy Sane.

With the title race beginning to heat up, Guardiola said that for every position in the side there will be tough competition among the players and also focused on the importance of substitutes in the side.

‚ÄúHopefully they will understand that at the big clubs you cannot have 11 players, so they have to compete with each other. In that kind of level in the Premier League, the people who are 12, 13, 14 and play in the game, they are so, so important.‚Äù Guardiola concluded.

Food Review: Twist of Taste,"Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant. Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant.

With a modern dining room that exposes its busy brigade of chefs through a glass panel on the ground floor, and a cosier, more sequestered space tailored for groups of four or more on the floor above, where jazz plays unobtrusively and mood lighting nudges the gaze towards the table, W. D. House makes one thing very clear: your focus is meant to be on the food.

W. D. House travelled south from Chandigarh, where it is both recognised and glorified, to Delhi last month. Much like its neighbour in GK II‚Äôs M block, China Garden, the fine dining restaurant opens itself to patrons from noon to 3.30 pm and then from 7 pm to midnight. This edition of W.D. or Whistling Duck, aims to encourage conversations about the ‚Äúindigenous modernity‚Äù of the ‚Äô40s and ‚Äò50s ‚Äî asserted with a single stem rose perched on tables dressed in lily-white covers and cane chairs, but also with its food. An ambitious menu ‚Äî that can, perhaps, leave one confused ‚Äî offers regional Indian, Southeast Asian, and European cuisines.

But, confusion is not a welcome guest here, and is soon defenestrated as head chef Richa Johari takes one through the menu. It is, then, easy to realise that the food here is as straightforward as her. You get what you ask for, but with a twist. Take, for instance, the Rhododendron squash, an enchanting, deep-pink drink made of the sweetly-scented flowers from Uttarakhand with celery and black salt. Or the Pashtun-style Chappali Kebabs, a compound of goat meat, coriander seeds, vetiver roots and pomegranate seeds, that followed soon after. The little frills are only a reflection of Johari‚Äôs deft hand with spices, and a result of her attention to detail evident in her zen-like precision to presentation.

Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant. Even with the Almond Crab Cake ‚Äî flakes of almond-coated fat crab patties to be paired with a gandhraj (strong scented citrus from Kolkata) aioli ‚Äî the flavours were neither big nor subtle. An attempt at choreographing a duet of textures came through in all the dishes.

If you want to better your relationship with karela, or bitter gourd, W.D. House should be your choice of counsellor. Rings of bitter gourd coated in batter and deep fried were tossed in a raw mango murabba dressing with raw onion, heirloom tomatoes and cucumber slices. This dish has the potential to convert the most ardent karela dismissers.

Another orthodox yet atypical offering from the restaurant‚Äôs kitchen was the Guay Tiew Moo, a dish popular in Thailand. Traditionally made with the meat that must not be named, this one was with pork that sat in the deep end of a bowl, amid lettuce, sprouts, and flat noodles, brimming with galangal flavoured broth with seemingly harmless red chillies that gave the soup a bit of a jolt. For the mains, a dish from Jharkhand, Dhuska ‚Äî deep-fried discs made with rice, lentils and chillies ‚Äî was paired with a chicken saag curry.

The dhuska mellowed the sharpness of the mustard oil that the chicken was cooked in, resulting in a harmony of flavours. The other main, a ravioli of blue cheese in a smooth, brighter-than-the-sun yellow, pumpkin puree came drizzled with basil flavoured olive oil and pine nuts. The umami from the parmesan, pungency of the blue cheese and sweetness of the pumpkin worked beautifully together, but the pasta was not al dente enough.

For dessert, we dug into the basil and lime cheesecake topped with a grape and balsamic reduction. The pairing of the basil with the reduction lent a sophisticated touch to the albeit slightly dry cheesecake, making for an intriguing conclusion to the eclectic meal.

India A concede lead as batsmen struggle against South Africa A spinners,"Disappointing outing for Karun Nair as he scored just one run. (Source: File) Disappointing outing for Karun Nair as he scored just one run. (Source: File)

Another disappointing day for India A batsmen as they struggled against South Africa A spinners to concede a 46-run first innings lead to the hosts in Potchefstroom on Monday. The visitors started the day‚Äôs play at 181/3 but no resistance from the middle-order saw them get bundle out for 276 on the third day of second, and final, unofficial Test. In reply, South Africa A were 138/4 at stumps and have stretched their overall lead to 184.

Apart from the top three Ravikumar Samarth (77), Sudip Chatterjee (46) and Shreyas Iyer (65), no other India A batsman put up a fight against the opposition spinners.. It could have been worse for Karun Nair-led unit had Shahbaz Nadeem not chipped in with a 36 lower down the order.

India A, trailing the series 0-1, found going tough against off-spinner Dane Piedt (4/70) and leg-spinner Shaun von Berg (2/84). Both took lion‚Äôs share of the wicket as Dane Paterson was the only stand out seamer with figures of 3/48. In their second innings, South Africa A rode on Stephen Cook‚Äôs unbeaten 55 to end the day in commanding position. The bowlers started well for the visitors before Cook and Andile Phehlukwayo combined well for an unbeaten stand.

India now need a special effort with both bat and ball to level the series. Not only do they need to pick early wickets, but score quick runs when they come out to bat for the second innings. Skipper Nair would like to lead from the front if he gets an opportunity to bat in the second innings.

We‚Äôre not getting carried away: Manchester United‚Äôs Nemanja Matic,"Matic, who joined United from champions Chelsea in July, played a key part in Jose Mourinho‚Äôs side picking up consecutive victories.

Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic is enjoying the positive dressing room atmosphere at his new club and believes that such team spirit will help the club cope with pressure over a long season.

United have won each of their first two Premier League games 4-0 and are top of the table on goal difference. Their dominance against West Ham United and Swansea City earned praise and fuelled fans‚Äô hopes of a first league title since 2013.

Matic, who joined United from champions Chelsea in July, played a key part in Jose Mourinho‚Äôs side picking up consecutive victories and the Serbian credits the results to the players‚Äô unity off the pitch rather than individual performances.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the beginning of the season, but I am confident,‚Äù Matic said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always special when you play for Manchester United and there is always pressure, but we are ready to cope with that.‚Äù

United will return to the Champions League next month after winning the Europa League in May.

‚ÄúThe group is great, we are all friends in the changing room and that‚Äôs very important. The season is long, so we have to have a good group, have good communication, and this team has that. I‚Äôm happy to be a part of this.‚Äù

Matic says the team are not becoming overconfident after notching two wins and are looking ahead to Saturday‚Äôs match against Leicester City, champions in 2015-16.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not getting carried away‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre two games into the season and we‚Äôve got another tough game against Leicester City next week, which won‚Äôt be easy. I‚Äôm just pleased to be playing,‚Äù Matic added.

Pro Kabaddi 2017: Strong defence keeps Gujarat Fortunegiants unbeaten,"Gujarat Fortunegiants are on a seven-match unbeaten run. Gujarat Fortunegiants are on a seven-match unbeaten run.

Playing their first away match after a stellar show in Ahmedabad, Gujarat Fortunegiants continued their victory march with a thumping 35-21 win over Puneri Paltan in Lucknow. As it has been the case so far in the league, Fortunegiants defenders kept the game in their hold and didn‚Äôt let the experience of Deepak Niwas Hooda, Rajesh Mondal hamper their unbeaten run in the fifth edition of Pro Kabaddi.

The Iranian dup of Fazrl Atrachali and Abozar Mighuani, who have been guarding Gujarat‚Äôs two corners, didn‚Äôt let Pune‚Äôs raiders escape from their aggressive play. In the 12th minute of the first half, Fortunegiants took down Deepak Niwas Hooda with Fazel‚Äôs strong ankle hold giving them a four point lead.

It was just matter of time, that Fortunegiants defenders forced the first all-out of the match taking their score to 14-5. From there on, the Pune team couldn‚Äôt make a way back and at half time the score was 16-7.

While Pune managed to keep Gujarat‚Äôs ‚Äòraiding machine‚Äô Sachin Tawar quiet in the second half, Abozar in the right corner led the rout of Pune‚Äôs raiders. With three minutes remaining in the match, Abozar held Deepak‚Äôs right leg so firmly that the Pune captain could not make an escape from it. With Deepak taken off, Pune trailed 20-28 and were inflicted the second all-out by Pawan Sehrawat‚Äôs successful raid.

Both teams possess strong defence and it was showcased as star raiders from either side could not score more than five points. Fazel, who suffered an injury in his right hand during Gujarat‚Äôs previous match, scored his seventh high 5. With this win, Gujarat are now on a seven match unbeaten run and top Zone A with 41 points.

ONGC to hire investment banker for HPCL acquisition,"The official said the acquisition will be done as per the Sebi takeover code. The price would be most likely be six month average of HPCL scrip on the day of the decision. The official said the acquisition will be done as per the Sebi takeover code. The price would be most likely be six month average of HPCL scrip on the day of the decision.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will hire investment bankers to assist it in acquiring government‚Äôs 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL). The investment or merchant banker to be hired will be separate from the one the government is hiring to manage its disinvestment, a senior official said.

The board of ONGC on Monday gave ‚Äòin principle approval‚Äô for acquisition of the government stake in HPCL, which at today trading price is worth about Rs 34,800 crore. He said a six-member Committee of Directors has been constituted to examine various aspects of the acquisition and to provide its recommendations to the board.

The panel includes Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf and Director (Finance) A K Srinivasan as also independent directors K M Padmanabhan, Sumit Bose and Vivek Mallya. Director (Technology & Field Services) Shashi Shanker, who has been selected to succeed Sarraf as the chairman of ONGC at the end of September, will also be part of the panel.

The official said the acquisition will be done as per the Sebi takeover code. The price would be most likely be six month average of HPCL scrip on the day of the decision. The government last month had approved sale of its 51.11 per cent stake in oil refiner HPCL to India‚Äôs largest oil producer ONGC.

Prior to the merger, HPCL is likely to take over Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) to bring all the refining assets of ONGC under one unit. ONGC currently owns 71.63 per cent of MRPL while HPCL has 16.96 per cent stake in it.

The official said ONGC will not have to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL as the government‚Äôs holding is being transferred to another state-run firm and the ownership is not changing. The deal will be completed within a year, he said. HPCL will become a subsidiary of ONGC and will remain a listed company post the acquisition, the source said, adding the board of the refining and marketing company will continue to remain separate.

The government has also constituted a committee ‚Äî headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and road minister Nitin Gadkari to work out the modalities of the sale.

Jaitley had, in his Budget for 2017-18, talked about creating an integrated oil behemoth. After that oil companies were asked to give their options. ONGC had evaluated options of acquiring either HPCL or BPCL ‚Äî the two downstream oil refining and fuel marketing companies.

It found the nation‚Äôs second-biggest fuel retailer BPCL too expensive and conveyed its choice to the parent oil ministry. Sources said the transaction is likely to be completed within this fiscal year. HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC‚Äôs portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.

Former boss of Dinamo Zagreb shot and wounded,"Zdravko Mamic is now an advisor at Dinamo Zagreb. (Source: Reuters File) Zdravko Mamic is now an advisor at Dinamo Zagreb. (Source: Reuters File)

Zdravko Mamic, the former boss of Croatian football club Dinamo Zagreb and one of country‚Äôs richest men, was shot and wounded in the leg by two attackers in western Bosnia on Tuesday, local media reported. Dinamo Zagreb, where Mamic is now an advisor, called the incident ‚Äúattempted murder‚Äù.

Web portal 24sata said Mamic, 58, was visiting his father‚Äôs grave near the Bosnian town of Tomislavgrad when two masked gunmen fired shots at him. He was transferred to a nearby hospital where he was treated for injuries to his leg, local media quoted a police spokesman as saying. Reuters could not immediately reach the police or representatives of Mamic for comment.

Mamic, a powerful figure in Croatian football who is currently on trial for tax evasion, has been the target of other physical attacks in the past few years, which soccer officials blamed on rival teams‚Äô fans, but this was the first time he has been shot and the motive was unclear.

Dinamo Zagreb, Croatia‚Äôs biggest football club, said in a statement after Tuesday‚Äôs attack that it was ‚Äúhorrified by the armed attack and the attempted murder of the club‚Äôs adviser‚Äù.

Mamic and two other former senior officials from Dinamo Zagreb are on trial after being charged with avoiding paying 12.2 million Croatian kuna ($1.94 million) in taxes and diverting 116 million kuna from the soccer club. All three deny the charges.

(Source ‚Äì AP/PTI)

The flood situation in Uttar Pradesh today remained alarming with reports of 10 more deaths, taking the toll to 82 in the current wave of floods in the state. ‚ÄúThe death toll in the floods has reached 82 in the state, where 2,855 villages in 25 districts are inundated affecting a population of over 22 lakh,‚Äù the relief commissioner‚Äôs office said here citing a flood report compiled till yesterday.

It said that around 50,000 people have taken shelter in relief camps in the affected districts of eastern UP where there was no let up in flood fury as raging waters of the rivers emanating from Nepal caused havoc in vast swathes of human habitation.

Reports reaching here said that Army choppers, NDRF and PAC (flood) jawans continued relief and rescue operations round the clock in the severely hit areas of the flood affected districts of the state. Release of water in the rivers emanating from Nepal and incessant rains impeded rescue work and evacuation of people to safer areas, they said.

26 companies of NDRF, 30 companies of PAC (flood) along with two choppers of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and several columns of the Army personnel were working round the clock to save lives and properties in the affected areas.

A Central Water Commission report here said that the Sharda was flowing above the red mark at Palia Kalan and near the danger mark at Shardanagar while Ghaghra was flowing above the red mark at Elgin Bridge, Ayodhya and Turtipar (Ballia).

River Rapti was also flowing well above the red mark at Rigauli and Birdghat (Gorakhpur), while Budhi Rapti was above the danger level at Kakrahi (Siddharth Nagar), rivers Rohin and Quano were flowing above danger mark at Trimohini Ghat (Mahrajganj) and Chandradeep Ghat (Gonda), it said.

Pakistan just managed to host Zimbabwe in 2015 for a bilateral ODI series after most of the teams boycotted visiting the country after the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by gunmen in 2009 while touring Pakistan. Moreover, Sri Lanka and West Indies too have agreed to play T20 international in September and November respectively.

‚ÄúCricket West Indies and Pakistan Cricket Board are advancing discussions that will see the West Indies team play the T20 matches with Pakistan in Lahore in late November,‚Äù said a statement released by the PCB.

‚ÄúMy mission statement is to bring back international cricket to Pakistan and hopefully we will be able to announce the full World XI side in next two to three days,‚Äù PCB chairman Najam Sethi told a news conference.

‚ÄúIt was a very difficult task convincing the Sri Lankan board to send their team to Lahore once again but they have shown great courage in accepting our request and hopefully if security arrangements are confirmed they will come and play T20 matches in October,‚Äù he added.

IIT-Kharagpur accepts whistleblower professor‚Äôs resignation,"IIT-Kharagpur is learnt to have accepted the resignation of Rajeev Kumar ‚Äî a professor who had exposed flaws in the Joint Entrance Examination. Last month, before demitting office, President Pranab Mukherjee had quashed the compulsory retirement imposed on Kumar in 2014.

Kumar had filed a PIL in Supreme Court seeking transparency in the IIT JEE, which eventually played a crucial role in IITs introducing several changes, including permitting examinees to take back a carbon copy of their answer scripts. He was hailed as an ‚Äúunsung hero‚Äù by the apex court.

The IIT-Kharagpur administration had suspended him in May 2011 after accusing him of ‚Äúdamaging the reputation of the institute‚Äù by levelling allegations on issues ranging from irregularities in the purchase of laptops to rampant copying by students during examinations.

The inquiry instituted against him found him guilty and in 2014 the institute decided to impose compulsory retirement on him. Kumar approached Delhi High Court against the decision and also appealed to the President alleging bias.

Kumar, who was on leave from IIT-Kharagpur for two years, joined Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Once his leave expired, IIT-Kharagpur asked him to report back to work but Kumar requested that his resignation be accepted so that he can join JNU permanently. The request was turned down on the ground that Kumar‚Äôs case is still being heard in court. Meanwhile, JNU relieved him of his job.

Kumar is learnt to have asked JNU to reinstate him as his resignation has been accepted by IIT-Kharagpur. The university has not acted on his request. JNU Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar did not respond to a call and SMS by The Indian Express on Sunday.

Sino-India frictions raise potential for open conflict: CRS,"The two-page brief report by independent and bipartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) titled ‚ÄòChina-Border Tensions at Doka La‚Äô comes amidst continued standoff between the soldiers of two countries in the Sikkim sector. The two-page brief report by independent and bipartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) titled ‚ÄòChina-Border Tensions at Doka La‚Äô comes amidst continued standoff between the soldiers of two countries in the Sikkim sector.

Intensified frictions between India and China raise the potential for an open conflict and could serve as an ‚Äúimpetus‚Äù for further US-India strategic cooperation that could have implications for Beijing, according to a Congressional report.

The two-page brief report by independent and bipartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) titled ‚ÄòChina-Border Tensions at Doka La‚Äô comes amidst continued standoff between the soldiers of two countries in the Sikkim sector.

‚ÄúIntensified frictions raise the potential for open conflict and could serve as an impetus for further US-India strategic cooperation that could have implications for China. An issue for Congress is whether to call on the Trump Administration to put forth a strategy and report on this strategic development,‚Äù the CRS said in its insight report.

CRS is an independent research wing of the US Congress, which prepares reports and policy papers for US lawmakers on issues of their interest for the Congressmen to take informed decision. Its reports are not considered as an official view of the US Congress.

The insight dated August 9 was released by non-profit Federation of American Scientists on Friday.

The US has maintained neutrality on the India-China border standoff and repeatedly encouraged the two countries to resolve their dispute through talks.

‚ÄúRecent border tensions between India and China may be indicative of a new phase of heightened Sino-Indian rivalry. This rivalry is manifesting itself not only along the two nations‚Äô 2,167-mile-long disputed Himalayan border, but also throughout South Asia and the broader Indian Ocean littoral region,‚Äù said the CRS insight authored by Bruce Vaughn.

A specialist in Asian Affairs, Vaughn notes that the border standoff at Doka La marks a shift in China-India ties that likely has more to do with the broader relationship than with the Himalayan border alone.

‚ÄúAn intensification of rivalry between China and India appears to be under way,‚Äù he wrote.

‚ÄúFor New Delhi, China‚Äôs efforts to block India from membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, develop the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor through a part of Kashmir (PoK) claimed by India, protect a Pakistan-based terrorist from UN sanctions, and develop China‚Äôs strategic presence in the Indian Ocean littoral have combined to increase New Delhi‚Äôs frustration with and suspicion of China,‚Äù Vaughn wrote.

‚ÄúChina has been wary of India‚Äôs decisions to not attend China‚Äôs Belt and Road summit in May 2017, allow the Dalai Lama to visit Arunachal Pradesh, and continue to develop strategic ties with the US. Given these larger dynamics, as well as specific statements and posturing on Doka La, it may be some time before the dispute is fully resolved,‚Äù the report concluded.

"Steve O‚ÄôKeefe was excellent in India but we‚Äôve decided to go with Ashton Agar, says Darren Lehmann","Ashton Agar was also a part of the Australia Test squad for India series earlier this year. (Source: File) Ashton Agar was also a part of the Australia Test squad for India series earlier this year. (Source: File)

Ahead of the first Test against Bangladesh in Mirpur, Australia‚Äôs left arm spinner, Ashton Agar, is most likely to feature in the starting eleven as coach Darren Lehmann is planning to include two spinners for the first match. If he players, it will be Agar‚Äôs first Test in four years. Agar made his debut in Tests against England in the 2013 Ashes series. He performed well with the bat in the two Tests.

Speaking to the reporters, Australia‚Äôs coach, Darren Lehmann said, ‚ÄúWe obviously haven‚Äôt played too much, so we‚Äôre fairly settled in where we want to go. That decision will be made later, once we start to have a look at the Test wicket and the conditions. Most likely, I think we‚Äôll play two spinners.‚Äù

Nathan Lyon will be spearheading Australia‚Äôs spin bowling attack and Agar has a great chance of accompanying Lyon for a twin spin combination as Steve O‚ÄôKeefe was dropped out of the team. Another youngster, Mitchell Swepson, who is yet to make his debut for Australia, might have to wait for some more time.

Agar was also a part of the Australia Test squad for India series, earlier this year, but was left out of the playing eleven. Left arm spinner O‚ÄôKeefe showed great form with the ball, picking up 19 wickets in the series, which included 12 in the first Test in Pune. Recently, O Keefe paid the price for his inappropriate behaviour towards a female cricketer at an award ceremony in April and was dropped from the squad for the Bangladesh series.

‚ÄúSteven was excellent over there but we‚Äôve decided to go with Ashton. He‚Äôs got the all-round game and hopefully he‚Äôll take it to the next level so if we wanted to play three quicks he could bat up the order, for example. He gives us a lot of flexibility in that way.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúYoung Swepson is a good prospect as a leg-spinner ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really tight between all the spinners but Ashton himself has batted really well, he‚Äôs a gun fielder and he‚Äôs got his length right with the ball.‚Äù

Australia cancelled their two-day practice match on Monday due to contaminated water and recent flooding at the ground. The first Test begins on Sunday, followed by the second and final Test in Chittagong.

After successfully hosting the Kabaddi World Cup, the Arena by TansStadia is hoping to bring international football to India. A multi-sport facility, the Arena is home for the Gujarat Fortunegiants ‚Äì one of the four new debutants ‚Äì in the 2017 edition of Pro Kabaddi. The TransStadia Founder & MD Udit Sheth in an interaction with indianexpress.com talked about the challenges they faced to complete the project, their future plans and how it stands apart from the already existing sports infrastructures in the country.

How did you come with such an idea and which all chief ministers did the company approach?

Before writing to different chief ministers, we were very clear that we wanted to get into viable infrastructure. Just not wanted to build a stadium and host events. When we had an opportunity to have a look at these technologies which allowed us to change the utilisation, change the formats and have different things on it, we decided to go ahead and approached all the ten demographics. And we got a response from 3-4 states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat and Meghalaya. Shiela Dixit ji, Ashok Chauhan, CM of Meghalaya and Narendra Modi showed interest. While Chauhan ji got replaced, Shiela ji was facing corruption charges for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. To my real surprise, it was Narendra Modi, who gave me an appointment and saw the merits of my design and gave me the green signal. And thus we decided to start up the pilot project in Ahmedabad.

Is it true that the land bought by TransStadia was first owned by a renowned local milk factory?

Yes, it is true that the land was earlier owned by Abad Dairy. If you look at the stadium it is located in the center of the city. It was not easy to get a land like this. So we asked the government to arrange us the land and took them under confidence that the rest of the cost for building the infrastructure will be looked after us.

What kind of technologies are being used/ available in The Arena by TransStadia?

If you have a look at TransStaida, we have three patent technologies. We have a steady arena technology, T-Box technology and turf protectors technology. So the first thing you can do here is cut down the capex. Because you are not building five different things but you have one thing which can be used for five different things. We broke the spectator facility from the regular training facility. We kept the cost of spectator facility very low while investing in new technologies.

How was the facility used after Kabaddi World Cup?

I think from the time World Cup has happened, that‚Äôs when we did a soft opening. Since then almost every leader from every state has come, many athletes have come. They have enjoyed the facilities here and want this project in all over India. Our idea is to at least have a 200-day schedule, be it sports or non-sports activities, in our public areas. While making sure that our services don‚Äôt deteriorate, our customers get the world class experience. Our 80,000 sq ft retail area is all booked out. It has already become a city center while people only see it as a stadium. Thus money is flowing in and there is no money crisis.

How did you manage to convince AKFI and Star Sports to host the Kabaddi World Cup in an incomplete project?

It‚Äôs very broadcaster friendly. If you ask Star Sports, they will tell you what their experience has been. We were an unfinished project. But we were possibly the easiest project at that time for them. For us the main agency was Star Sports. We had approached the CEO and planned a visit. They liked the facilities and the support from the state government and the local public was very excited. Basically, Star wanted us to complete the project that was in place.

How are you maintaining the stadium, the up keeping, and the costs

We actually officially started only in March 2017. Till then we were doing a test run. We had to get our work processes in places, systems in place. So all that earlier spent during the test run was taken into project funding. Revenues come in later on. Now we have foot fall, we get 20-23 days of booking. I think revenues have started and I have no doubt it‚Äôs not only the envy of Ahmedabad but also the envy of India.

If you look at Pro Kabaddi, it has come here for seven days which gives us national visibility. The World Cup gave us worldwide visibility. And we are expecting Gujarat to pick up many more teams in all the leagues. And I‚Äôm pretty much sure that all teams will want to make TransStadia as their home base. This stadium has a very big advantage looking at the spectator standpoint.

What are the future plans for the stadium? What kind of events can we expect to be held in Ahmedabad?

There is an Asian Table Tennis championship competition coming up here then after badminton league and the indoor futsal league is in talks with us. We are in talks with the boxing federations to bring world championships to Ahmedabad. I am more than convinced that Gujarat will overdose on international events.

Are you looking for hosting Asian Games or National Games?

No, when we are talking about Asian Games, they need a multi-facilitated venue. They need multiple venues at the same time and we are not multiple venues. We could have been a part of a FIFA World Cup as we have a football stadium.

Despite having a football stadium, why didn‚Äôt TransStadia bid to host FIFA U-17 World Cup?

When India had bid for the FIFA U-17 World Cup that time our project had not started. So, they shortlisted six locations at that time. However, we were kept on standby when two of the shortlisted venues were still under completion. And if you see, none of them is a football only stadium. They either have an athletics track or are a cricket stadium with a football pitch. So, there are possibilities of worst spectator experience because they are going to be quite far. However, we are going to bid for U-19 World Cup and I‚Äôm sure that Gujarat will be shortlisted. We recently had a FIFA‚Äôs Mission XI Million in Ahmedabad. So, the international football federation knows about us and the facilities we are capable of.

Iraq must ensure Islamic State‚Äôs victims of sexual violence see justice -U.N,"U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‚Äôad Al Hussein said, ‚ÄúThe physical, mental, and emotional injuries inflicted by ISIL are almost beyond comprehension.‚Äù (Source: AP/File) U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‚Äôad Al Hussein said, ‚ÄúThe physical, mental, and emotional injuries inflicted by ISIL are almost beyond comprehension.‚Äù (Source: AP/File)

Iraq must ensure that women and girls subjected to sexual violence at the hands of Islamic State militants have access to justice and reparations, U.N. investigators said on Tuesday.

Thousands of people, predominantly from Iraq‚Äôs ethnic and religious minorities, have been subjected to sexual violence since Islamic State militants swept across vast swathes of Iraq in 2014. The report pays particular attention to members of the country‚Äôs Yazidi community, who were kidnapped and forcibly converted, enslaved or conscripted to fight for the militants.

‚ÄúWomen and girls under the control of ISIL, in particular women from the Yazidi and other minority communities, have been especially vulnerable to abuses of human rights and violation of international humanitarian law,‚Äù the report by the U.N. Assistance Mission to Iraq and the U.N. Human Rights Office said.

More than 6,800 Yazidis were kidnapped by Islamic State. About 3,000 of them are still believed to be held captive.

Victims must be provided with access to appropriate medical, psychosocial and financial support, the report said. ‚ÄúThe physical, mental, and emotional injuries inflicted by ISIL are almost beyond comprehension. If victims are to rebuild their lives, and indeed those of their children, they need justice and they need redress,‚Äù said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‚Äôad Al Hussein.

The report, based on interviews with survivors, found that support for the victims must come with significant changes to the criminal justice system to prove effective. U.N. investigators highlighted gaps in the legal frameworks of both Iraq and Iraq‚Äôs autonomous Kurdish Region, which ‚Äúlargely fail to ensure the appropriate respect and protection of women and children who have been subjected to sexual and other forms of violence‚Äù. Iraq‚Äôs laws governing sexual and domestic violence offer inadequate protections for women, and would be an obstacle to the prosecution of Islamic State-related crimes, the report said.

The report comes three days after Iraqi security forces launched their offensive to retake the city of Tal Afar, one of the militant groups‚Äô last remaining strongholds in Iraq. ‚ÄúWith significant areas under the control of ISIL having been reclaimed, it is now urgent to consider what steps need to be taken to ensure the protection, recovery, reintegration and redress for the thousands of women and girls,‚Äù the report states.

Though the report focuses on crimes committed by Islamic State, it also references abuses committed by groups fighting against the militants. These include ‚Äúrevenge attacks‚Äù against women thought to have been affiliated with IS, sometimes sanctioned by tribal agreements.

Marriage licenses and birth certificates issued in IS-held territories are generally not recognized by Iraqi and Kurdish officials. The report recommends that this be rectified, to avoid leaving women and babies without legal status, particularly those born of sexual slavery. UNHCR has identified nearly 800 children whose births had been registered by Islamic State in areas under its control. Investigators found that men and boys had also been subjected to sexual violence by the militants.

Tuesday‚Äôs report builds on last year‚Äôs finding that Islamic State was committing genocide against the Yazidi people. The rare designation under international law marked the first time genocide was recognized as being carried out by non-state actors.

Turkmenistan: Liquor stores closed in capital ahead of international sporting events,"There has been no announcement from the government of an alcohol ban. There has been no announcement from the government of an alcohol ban.

Liquor stores have been closed down and alcoholic products taken off the shelves of food stores in the capital of Turkmenistan ahead of a major international athletic competition next month.

Merchants at several stores told The Associated Press on Saturday that authorities had ordered alcohol sales halted until October, after the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games conclude. The competition in Ashgabat, the capital, takes place Sept. 17-27.

There has been no announcement from the government of an alcohol ban. The merchants did not give their names, reflecting concern about the authoritarian country‚Äôs intolerance of criticism.

Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has made sports and physical fitness a top initiative and has launched a program to make the country tobacco-free by 2025.

Poverty-level of Indian-origin people in S Africa decreases,"The poverty level of Indian-origin people in South Africa has consistently decreased over the past two decades from almost 21 per cent to under six per cent, according to official data released on Tuesday. The South African-Indian community, with about 1.4-million people, are not far behind from their white counterparts, who enjoyed special privileges in the apartheid era and have a poverty rate of just one per cent.

Coloured (mixed race) and the majority black Africans are lagging way behind with 41 and 61 per cent respectively, latest results from Statistics South Africa (SSA) show.

Statistician-General Pali Lehohla released the ‚ÄòPoverty Trends in South Africa‚Äô report which shows that despite the general decline in poverty between 2006 and 2011, overall poverty level in South Africa rose in 2015.

Black people continued to bear the brunt of poverty but that education remains the key to escaping poverty, Lehohla told reporters.

‚ÄúThree out of five blacks are poor. Poor whites are (almost) non-existent. Indians moved‚Ä¶ we could see this in the numbers when we talked about education. (Indians) caught up with whites in education, poverty dropped and education increased,‚Äù Lehola said.

‚ÄúUnlike the other population groups, the proportion of poor Indians consistently decreased between 2006 and 2015, reporting a decrease of 71.8 per cent.

‚ÄúIt is worthwhile to note that the decrease between 2011 and 2015 was less pronounced than the decrease experienced between 2006 and 2011. Nevertheless, Indians appear to have made strong gains in the war on poverty,‚Äù the report said.

Once subjected to restrictive apartheid laws, the first indentured labourers who arrived in the country from 1860 placed huge emphasis on education, pooling resources from their often meagre wages to build their own schools and send children to universities.

This practice, continued by future generations, resulted in poverty levels getting decreased over the past 167 years, with the 20.9 per cent poverty among the 1.4 million citizens of Indian-origin in 2006 having dropped to 5.9 per cent in the latest survey, the report added.

North Korea issues trademark fiery rhetoric over US-South Korea drills,"The North‚Äôs military says it will launch an unspecified ‚Äúmerciless retaliation and unsparing punishment‚Äù on the United States over the Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills that began yesterday.

North Korea‚Äôs military unleashed its standard fiery threats to greet the start of annual US-South Korean military drills that the North claims are an invasion rehearsal. The North Korean rhetoric on Tuesday came as top US generals, including Admiral Harry Harris, the commander of US forces in the Pacific, visited South Korea.

The US generals were to travel to the site of a contentious US missile-defense system in South Korea later today.

The North‚Äôs military says it will launch an unspecified ‚Äúmerciless retaliation and unsparing punishment‚Äù on the United States over the Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills that began yesterday.

North Korea has previously issued similar warlike rhetoric whenever US and South Korean troops conducted major joint exercises.An unprompted direct attack is extremely unlikely because the United States vastly outguns Pyongyang.

Spanish police on Monday shot dead a man who could be Younes Abouyaaqoub, the suspected driver of a van that mowed down pedestrians in Barcelona, amid a massive manhunt for the Moroccan national described as dangerous and likely armed. ‚ÄúThey have shot dead a suspect who could be the perpetrator of the attack,‚Äù a source close to the probe told AFP on condition of anonymity. Regional police confirmed a man wearing what appeared to be a suicide belt had been killed in Subirats, a village about 60 kilometres (37 miles) away from Barcelona, without identifying the individual. Bomb disposal units have been dispatched to the site.

Earlier on Monday, police had launched an appeal for information about the 22-year-old fugitive, believed to be the last remaining member of a 12-man cell suspected of plotting last week‚Äôs deadly attacks. The other suspects have been killed by police or detained after the vehicle rampages in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils. The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the assaults, believed to be its first in Spain.

Authorities on Monday raised the death toll to 15, confirming that Pau Perez, a 34-year-old man found stabbed to death in a Ford Focus outside Barcelona on Friday, was killed by Abouyaaqoub. The police had fired at the car as it forced its way through a checkpoint shortly after the Barcelona carnage, and later found Perez in the vehicle. Investigators believe the victim was the owner of the car, which was hijacked by Abouyaaqoub to make his getaway.

Describing Abouyaaqoub as around 1.8 metres (five feet, 11 inches) tall, police tweeted four photographs of the man with short black hair, including three pictures in which he was wearing a black and white striped T-shirt. He is ‚Äúdangerous and could be armed,‚Äù police in Catalonia said. Spanish authorities were also officially notifying European police of the identity of the suspect to enable the launch of a Europe-wide manhunt.

"NEET ordinance by Tamil Nadu not good in law, says A-G","K K Venugopal K K Venugopal

In what may come as a jolt for the newfound bonhomie between Centre and Tamil Nadu after the AIADMK merger, the attorney general has, in his opinion to the health ministry on the state government‚Äôs ordinance exempting TN students from appearing in the common medical entrance examination, said that the ordinance is not good in law.

This is the second time that the ordinance that was sent by the Tamil Nadu government more than a week back to the home ministry, was referred to attorney general KK Venugopal.

Earlier when it had been referred by the law ministry the officer had approved it as being good as per the provisions of the Constitution of India. Subsequently, the ordinance was cleared by both the law and the HRD ministries.

However, when it came to the health ministry, it was referred back to the A-G with some additional facts and past judgements of the apex court on the issue. It was in response to these additional facts that the A-G has revised his opinion, say top government sources.

The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to all medical colleges in the country both government and private has seen a long legal battle since it was first attempted in 2013. The examination that year was stayed with a clutch of petitions in the Supreme Court from deemed universities, minority institutions and some state governments. It was finally started in 2016, much to the chagrin of states like Tamil Nadu.

Tamil Nadu has argued that the test favours CBSE students and those studying in state boards schools lose out because they have been used to admissions based on their class XII results. It is also discriminatory, the state has argued as students in districts far-flung from the capital and belonging to weaker sections, would tend to lose out.

NEET exemption has been a very sensitive topic in Tamil Nadu with former CM J Jayalalithaa having written multiple letters first to PM Manmohan Singh and then to PM Narendra Modi demanding that the state be treated separately.

In the present case, a team from the Tamil Nadu government had been camping in Delhi for the ordinance to be speedily cleared. It was widely expected to make the cut after Union ministers like Nirmala Sitharaman put their weight behind it. Health Minister J P Nadda also told the Rajya Sabha that Tamil Nadu‚Äôs concerns about NEET would be looked into.

On Monday soon after the AIADMK merger was announced prime minister Narendra Modi tweeted: ‚ÄúCentre assures all possible support to CM Thiru Edappadi K. Palaniswami & Dy CM Thiru O Panneerselvam for the growth of TN. @OfficeOfOPS‚Äù. That promise may have started off with a stumble given the A-G‚Äôs negative opinion on the ordinance that is very important for the state.

The health ministry‚Äôs contention on NEET is that if Tamil Nadu‚Äôs demand for exemption is acceded to, similar demands may flow for other states too thus causing this most important reform of medical education to collapse even as others are trying to emulate it; there is a common entrance for engineering courses too on the anvil. There are already reports of Gujarat examining the TN ordinance to seek similar treatment for students from Gujarati-medium schools.

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu government has asked the Medical Council of India to sanction 2,700 more medical seats in the state in order to allay concerns of the Supreme Court about the fate of students from the state who have already cleared NEET. The demand is unlikely to be viewed favourably by the council as increasing seats is a function of many other factors including availability of faculty and infrastructure.

Nine killed in Abu Sayyaf militant attack in Philippines: Police,"President Rodrigo Duterte has imposed martial law across the southern third of the Philippines, including Basilan, to quell the militant threat. Following Monday‚Äôs attack, residents evacuated their homes in fear and authorities sent more troops to secure the area.

Following Monday‚Äôs attack, residents evacuated their homes in fear and authorities sent more troops to secure the area. (Representational Image/Reuters)

Islamist gunmen killed nine people and injured ten others as they attacked a town in the Philippines at dawn today, burning houses in which women and children were sleeping, police said. About 60 members of the notorious Abu Sayyaf kidnap-for-ransom group entered a town in their stronghold on Basilan island in the southern Mindanao region and began shooting, local police chief John Cundo told AFP.

‚ÄúThis is an act of terrorism and cowardice. When our forces engaged them in a 45-minute firefight and they felt our numbers and volume of fire they backed away and fled,‚Äù Cundo said. ‚ÄúWhat is unfortunate is that women and children were affected as they were still sleeping when this happened.‚Äù

The militants burned four houses and a day care centre in the town of Maluso, Cundo said, adding police and the military were conducting ‚Äúhot pursuit‚Äù operations against the gunmen. The Abu Sayyaf is a loose network of militants formed in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden‚Äôs Al-Qaeda network.

Its members have engaged in banditry and kidnapping, targeting foreigners in exchange for millions of dollars in ransom. One faction based on Basilan has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.

It is not clear whether that faction was involved in today‚Äôs attack on Maluso, although its members are among militants who have been occupying since May parts of Marawi, the largely Catholic nation‚Äôs most important Islamic city. The militants have withstood a US-backed military offensive in Marawi that has claimed more than 700 lives and displaced nearly 400,000 people.

President Rodrigo Duterte has imposed martial law across the southern third of the Philippines, including Basilan, to quell the militant threat. Following Monday‚Äôs attack, residents evacuated their homes in fear and authorities sent more troops to secure the area, according to Cundo.

Malegaon blast: Supreme Court modifies Purohit‚Äôs bail condition,"Malegaon blast accused Lt Col Prasad Purohit. Malegaon blast accused Lt Col Prasad Purohit.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday made a minor change in one of the conditions it had imposed while granting bail to Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case. Purohit was granted bail subject to several conditions by the apex court yesterday after he had spent eight years and eight months in jail in the case.

A bench of Justices R K Agrawal and Abhay Mohan Sapre modified the order after Purohit, through his counsel, sought changes to the condition that he has to furnish personal security of Rs one lakh along with two solvent sureties. He pleaded that instead of solvent sureties, it should be modified to cash securities.

To this, the bench said in its modified order that ‚Äúon his furnishing personal security in the sum of Rs one lakh with two cash sureties, each of the like amount, to the satisfaction of the trial court, and the cash sureties will be replaced by solvent sureties within 15 days.‚Äù Among other conditions imposed by apex court while granting bail to Purohit was that he would not leave India without prior permission of court and not directly or indirectly make any inducement to any witnesses.

The apex court had yesterday granted bail to him saying it cannot deny the relief merely because ‚Äúsentiments of community was against him‚Äù. Six people were killed in a bomb blast on September 29, 2008, at Malegaon, a communally-sensitive textile town in Nasik district of north Maharashtra.

Purohit had moved the apex court challenging the Bombay High Court‚Äôs order dismissing his bail plea. A special MCOCA court had earlier ruled that the ATS had wrongly applied this law against Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, Purohit and nine others.

"Arjuna award devalued, made cheap: Past recipients","The Sports Ministry on Tuesday confirmed the names of the Arjuna awardees for this year but many have question the ‚Äúdignity‚Äù of the award as the government is ‚Äúthrowing‚Äù the awards away. Former Arjuna awardees including former captain of Indian hockey team Ashok Kumar and middle-distance runner Sriram Singh Shekhawat raised their voices against it.

‚ÄúThe dignity has to be maintained. Why do you need to give Arjuna every year. Is it necessary? We are now throwing the awards away,‚Äù Ashok told PTI. ‚ÄúThey (government) have set their own parameters. The value attached with the award should be increased. There should be a cap that only Asiad and Olympic medal winners should be selected for the Arjuna honour,‚Äù Ashok, son of the legendary hockey player Dhyanchand, said.

The 1975 World Cup winner and recipient of the Arjuna award in 1974 also questioned the process by which the awards are been given.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt beg for award or demand it. Why should I blow my own trumpet that I have achieved something. When someone goes out for competition, it happens with the permission of the government. They know the achievements so it should be the government which should pick athletes rather than players sending applications,‚Äù he said.

The awards will be conferred to the winners on August 29 ‚Äî National Sports Day. Indian squash player Saurabh Ghosal also said that the process should be reconsidered.

‚ÄúI think the concept of recommending or nominating someone for the awards is flawed. It just doesn‚Äôt sound right that player needs to be recommended or needs to apply for the award. The committee should pick the winners on their own on the basis of performances. Applying for the awards is like asking for a grant,‚Äù the 2006 Arjuna awardee said.

Shekhawat, who holds the national record in men‚Äôs 800m since 1976, said that there was a tough fight for the award back in his days.

‚ÄúWhen Arjuna awards were decided for year 1972, I was Asiad medallist but still did not get it. There was only one slot and the award was given to V S Chauhan. We both were national record holders but since he was senior to me, he was chosen,‚Äù Shekhawat said. ‚ÄúThe selected athletes should be a medal winner at least at the Asian Games level,‚Äù he suggested.

Echoing the same words, former captain of the Indian volleyball team Suresh Mishra said that there should be so many awards.

‚ÄúWhich name is bigger, Arjuna or Rajiv Gandhi. It‚Äôs an insult to Arjuna award. It has been degraded,‚Äù he said about the award which was constituted in 1972.

Amid all this, Zafar Iqbal, former captain of Indian hockey team, said that awards help encourage athletes.

‚ÄúThe award is not only for the athletes but also for the masses who follow. It encourages everyone. It has been fair. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs devalued,‚Äù the 1979 Arjuna awardee said.

The 37th India Day Parade organised by the Federation of Indian Associations ‚Äì New York, New Jersey, Connecticut ‚Äì ran through several streets in Madison Avenue in Manhattan yesterday and featured tableaux by several Indian-American organisations, marching bands, police contingents and cultural performances by young Indian-American children.

Greeting the crowd, New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio said the Independence Day parade celebrates the ‚Äúextraordinary contributions‚Äù of the Indian-American community to the city. ‚ÄúThis is a day we appreciate what people do for the city regardless of what they look like, regardless of what language they speak, regardless of where they were born. Everyone here contributes to making New York City better and making America stronger. That is what we are celebrating today,‚Äù de Blasio said.

The mayor, holding the Indian tricolour, waved to the thousands of people gathered along the parade route. Daggubati, the Grand Marshal for the parade, said it was a matter of great pride for him to celebrate the Independence Day with a large population of Indian-Americans. ‚ÄúIt gives me a huge sense of pride to be here. The people here are the ambassadors of our country making us proud outside of India,‚Äù he said. Bhatia said, ‚ÄúIt is amazing to see Indians celebrating‚Äù the country‚Äôs culture and heritage.

‚ÄúIndia has given me lot of freedom to express myself. It is very humbling to represent India at the parade,‚Äù she said. Padama Shri awardee Sudhir Parikh, a medical doctor and long-time leader of the Indian-American community, said over the years the parade has been a bridge between India and the second and third generation Indian-Americans. A float by the Indian Consulate in the city focused the rich cultural heritage of India‚Äôs northeast states. Thousands of people from the New York tri-state area came for the day-long celebration, which included special food stalls, cultural extravaganza and about 25 floats by various Indian organisations based in the US such as Air India.

People, including young children and seniors, raised patriotic slogans like ‚ÄòBharat Mata Ki Jai‚Äô, ‚ÄòVande Mataram‚Äô and ‚ÄòJai Hind‚Äô and carried banners, placards and Indian and American flags as they witnessed the floats and celebrities from the barricaded pavements along the parade route. Indian music and popular Bollywood songs reverberated through the air as people celebrated with a fervour of patriotism.

Several Americans and people belonging to different communities also stopped to watch the parade and enjoy the festivities. Families had travelled from nearby states such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts to witness the parade, an annual fixture in the city‚Äôs calendar since 1981. On India‚Äôs Independence Day on August 15, the iconic Empire State Building was lit up in the Indian try-colour. Commemorating the Day, India‚Äôs Consul-General here Ambassador Sandeep Chakravorty had rung the opening bell at the NASDAQ stock market in Times Square. Flag-hoisting ceremonies and commemorative events were held at the Indian Consulate as well as at India‚Äôs Permanent Mission to the UN.

Singer Kailash Kher had attended the flag hoisting ceremony at the permanent mission. Later speaking to PTI, Kher applauded the significant contributions of Indian Americans to the social and economic fabric of the US. He called on Indians settled in America to join hands and continue to make contributions that take India to the next level of growth and development, particularly through support of flagship Indian programmes such as ‚ÄòSwachch Bharat‚Äô, ‚ÄòBeti Bachao Beti Padhao‚Äô and ‚ÄòDigital India‚Äô.

Australian men charged with terrorism over mosque fires,"Two of the men are already in custody and awaiting trial on suspicion of plotting bomb attacks in Australia‚Äôs second largest city last year. (File Photo) Two of the men are already in custody and awaiting trial on suspicion of plotting bomb attacks in Australia‚Äôs second largest city last year. (File Photo)

Australian police have charged three men with committing terrorist acts on suspicion of starting fires at a Shiite Muslim mosque in Melbourne last year, inspired by Islamic State and intending to divide the Muslim community. Two of the men are already in custody and awaiting trial on suspicion of plotting bomb attacks in Australia‚Äôs second largest city last year, while a third ‚Äì a 29-year-old Melbourne man ‚Äì was arrested late on Saturday. All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment over the arson attack at the Imam Ali Islamic Centre in December 2016.

Australian Federal Police‚Äôs counter terrorism national manager said that attacking a place of worship had no place in society. ‚ÄúIt is clear that these arson attacks were designed to intimidate and influence those that attend this mosque and the wider Islamic community,‚Äù Assistant Commissioner Ian McCartney said on Sunday. Australia, a staunch U.S. ally that has sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, has been on heightened alert since 2014 for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, or their supporters.

While there have been several ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù attacks, officials say 13 significant plots have been foiled in that time. Police say the three men were adherents of militant Sunni Muslim ideology. Police said the arrest of the man on Saturday came after extensive investigations into fires at the Melbourne mosque ‚Äì but said it did not relate to any direct threat to the community. The other two men facing charges are in custody and awaiting trial for allegedly planning militant attacks around Christmas Day 2016 in Melbourne. The two, a 25-year-old and a 27-year-old, will also be charged with terrorist offences for causing a previous fire at the Imam Ali Islamic Centre in November 2016.

The man arrested on Saturday will appear in Melbourne Magistrates‚Äô Court on Sunday, while the other two will appear in court on Monday. This month, two men were charged with terror-related offences after authorities disrupted what they described as an Islamic State-inspired plot to bomb an Etihad Airways flight. Another man arrested in relation to the foiled plot was charged with weapons offences and released on bail. A fourth man was released without charge. A gunman in a 2014 Sydney cafe siege boasted about links with Islamic State militants, although no direct ties with the group were established. The gunman and two other people were killed in the siege.

Add lights and greenery to your home for positive vibes,"Corners are the easiest to fill with plants and lamps. (Photo source: File Photo) Corners are the easiest to fill with plants and lamps. (Photo source: File Photo)

Decorate your home with ample lights be it in the form of lamps or chandeliers, introduce few planters with fresh flowers to the sad and empty corners of your home to bring in that positive vibes and tranquility, suggest experts.

Retesh Sharma, Director at Zynna and Sukriti Sharma, Director at Plusch, have listed creative d√©cor ideas:

* Fetch greenery inside: Adding planters with loads of fresh flowers and green plants creates the serene milieu.

* Light the area right: Lights plays a key role in setting the ambiance right. Adding up few chandeliers and lamps will create a beautiful serene in the room. Also, incorporating few scented candles in your rooms is yet another great idea that not only spread aroma around but also generate the loving atmosphere around.

* When we talk about bringing spring botanicals in your abode then instead of changing whole upholstery best way to bring them is in cushions or nature inspired curtains can also work well. You can contrast them with neon colours and dwelling is ready with a makeover.

Adding floral design, nature upholstery pieces with contrasting rugs can also work well. Also watercolour-style flower-print fabric can also be incorporated that can be used on key items, such as a footstool or cushions.

* Small decorative pieces, fruit bowls, decorative ornaments and magazine baskets also enhance the look of the living room, hence plays a vital role in bringing any themed d√©cor in the house.

You can add photoframes, bamboo d√©cor products also smaller objects such as coasters, decorative trays and room diffuser, art pieces works well.

* Many a times we see that only one single colour wall is the focal point in any room. This trend is pass√©. Instead use printed wallpapers to brighten any space in your house whether it is bedroom, living area, dining room or balcony as well.

* Infuse the light scented candles that not only create an aromatic room but also create a nice ambience. Furthermore, you can set a relaxing mood by arranging a variety of oil lamps and candles on decorative trays and let them work their magic on your senses.

* Adorn your interiors with brighter shades of yellow, orange, red, blue and green. Opt for the colours that complement each other and provide an exuberant aura to your home.

Use floral prints as d√©cor in your home to keep your home lively, cheerful and fresh. Keep aside the heavy drapes and welcome sheer or pellucid curtains in your homes.

Malaysia apologizes for showing Indonesia‚Äôs flag as Poland‚Äôs,"Indonesian President Joko ‚ÄúJokowi‚Äù Widodo. (File/Photo) Indonesian President Joko ‚ÄúJokowi‚Äù Widodo. (File/Photo)

Malaysia apologized to Indonesia on Sunday for an ‚Äúunintentional‚Äù mistake in printing the Indonesian flag upside down in a souvenir guidebook for the Southeast Asian Games. The error made the red-and-white Indonesian flag resemble Poland‚Äôs and caused anger in Indonesia, where ‚Äúshameonyoumalaysia‚Äù has become the most popular hashtag on Twitter. President Joko ‚ÄúJokowi‚Äù Widodo demanded an apology for hurt national pride but also cautioned against exaggerating the incident with his neighbor. The two countries share the same religion and language but often trade accusations of stealing the other‚Äôs food and culture.

Malaysian Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin met his Indonesian counterpart Imam Nahrawi to personally apologize. After a brief private meeting Sunday, the two ministers shook hands at a news conference.

Khairy, who was quick to issue the first apology late Saturday on Twitter, said that the guidebooks will be corrected and reprinted.

Indonesia appears to have taken particular offense because the guidebook was distributed to VIPs at Saturday‚Äôs opening ceremony in Kuala Lumpur for the 29th Southeast Asian Games and only its flag was shown incorrectly.

Nahrawi, who earlier described the error as ‚Äúvery painful,‚Äù said he accepted the apology.

‚ÄúWe hope these mistakes don‚Äôt get repeated because flags are important symbols for each country and should be respected,‚Äù he said.

Khairy said the mistake was ‚Äúunintentional and it happened due to our carelessness.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis was a big, big mistake. I, on behalf of the host, have conveyed our apologies to ‚Ä¶ Imam as the Indonesian minister and also I apologize to the people of Indonesia for this mistake,‚Äù he said.

The creation of Malaysia when the British empire was dismantled after World War II was bitterly opposed by Indonesia, itself then a new nation emerging from Dutch colonial rule and a short-lived Japanese occupation.

On Twitter, Indonesians said their flag represents the sacrifices of independence heroes and accused Malaysia of either being stupid or deliberately misprinting it.

‚ÄúYou know, this is maybe the reason why our founding father Soekarno wanted to Kick Your Ass,‚Äù said one user.

What they didn‚Äôt tell you: Coming out is a never-ending process,"What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar) What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar)

What do you want to be when you grow up?‚Äù a ninth grade English paper once asked me. It was a 20-mark essay, and I had 20 minutes to earn them. I rolled up my sleeves, and pulled out my cursive best.

The thing is, I wanted to be a great many things.I wanted to be a chef, an actor, a painter; I wanted to be an astronaut, and, for two weeks after I turned 11, I wanted to be a National Geographic correspondent ‚Äî if only because my older sister said that she wanted to be one. From the age of six to 16, I raced through changes. My styles, my sexual leanings and my haircuts changed, and so did my dreams.Only, what did I never dream of being? Myself.

I was so used to pushing my problems under a hypothetical carpet, that I never realised the lies I was hoarding. It was an easy, lazy life. Through adolescence, I used this complacency as a security blanket, and wound it around myself whenever thoughts of the future terrified me. What would coming out (as a gay man) be like? Would I have to talk about my feelings? Would I have someone to talk about my feelings to (a fair question, because I grew up thinking that you were only allowed to talk about your feelings at expensive therapy sessions, sappy book clubs or when watching romantic tearjerkers)?

Growing up signified independence ‚Äî no more staying at home, no more rules, no more restrictions, no more getting worried over your mother‚Äôs 18 missed calls (well, almost). But I didn‚Äôt know what I would do with all the freedom. Independence petrified me. What would I do being free? Would I finally have to be myself?

People are terrified to be themselves, especially when bravery is an option, and not an obligation. I‚Äôve been called manipulative, selfish, a coward and a sore loser. Why would I want to be myself then? I‚Äôd rather be someone nicer and more admirable; I‚Äôd rather be someone else.

Some enjoy the peace that comes with accepting who they are, but most of us get stuck on the fence in the middle. Take sexuality, for instance. We can stir ourselves to walk free and fabulous, but we‚Äôd rather stay safe and sound in the cage of heteronormativity. I made myself feel at home in the cage till I was 21. The thing about independence, though, is that it doesn‚Äôt come gift-wrapped and express delivered to your front doorstep. It needs to be earned, or fought for.

Coming to terms with your sexuality and stepping out of the closet isn‚Äôt easy ‚Äî especially in a country like India, where minds can be as narrow as Bandra‚Äôs bylanes, even if you are an upper-class, well-educated man (and sometimes, especially if you an upper-class, well-educated man). As countless films and American television shows have told us, you don‚Äôt just wake up one morning and walk out into the sunlit world. To reach the closet door, you need to push through your woollens, those ‚Äúbuy-one-get-one-free‚Äù shirts you bought on an impulse, and the odd tangle of smelly socks, greying underwear and smutty novels you don‚Äôt want your mother to find. It will be tough, especially if you‚Äôve been hoarding ‚Äî and holding back ‚Äî all your life.

And even when you do, it‚Äôs a never-ending process. Those closet doors that everyone talks about? They are revolving. Week after week, you will find yourself coming out to friends, family, acquaintances, and (occasionally) drunken strangers at the bar. Perhaps, one day it will not be the big deal that it is today, and you won‚Äôt have to worry about whether your words are followed by a kiss to the cheek or a punch to the mouth. Every new acceptance is a fresh slice of independence, and you‚Äôll wolf it all down.

Fortunately, my personal coming out story reeks of acceptance and Hallmark cards. I sat my parents down and told them everything in a diligently rehearsed 17-minute monologue. In 18 minutes, it was done. Questions were asked, hugs were exchanged, a tear was shed (that would be me). My mum went for a walk with her friends and my dad continued solving the crossword puzzle. They accepted it with a simple shrug (and lots of love and support over the next couple of years, but this is not that story). My sexuality was just another fact.

What about the war of words I had been expecting? The emotional bloodshed? The years of torment at the hands of society? They never came, even though history books said that they would. Times are changing, and somewhere over pop culture references and more inclusive media representations, my parents and peers had changed as well. The history books had it wrong.

What they did get right was this ‚Äî freedom felt liberating. The freedom to stay single. To be a sexual deviant. The freedom to wear a skirt (if you are a man) or a jersey (if you are a woman). The freedom to wear both, or neither. The freedom to never find your way back home.

What do we do with the freedom then? Do we let it consume us? Terrify us into never seeking it out? We do neither. We simply unwind and enjoy it with a cup of tea. Preferably, chamomile.

"Wayne Rooney nets 200th English Premier League goal, Everton draw 1-1 at Manchester City","Wayne Rooney is enjoying something of a career renaissance since leaving United in the off season to return to his boyhood club. (Source: Reuters) Wayne Rooney is enjoying something of a career renaissance since leaving United in the off season to return to his boyhood club. (Source: Reuters)

Wayne Rooney wheeled away in delight after scoring his 200th goal in the English Premier League, cupping both of his ears with his hands in front of the Manchester City fans who jeered his name and his every touch.

The Everton striker had just joined an exclusive scoring club and, as a former Manchester United player, he was determined to enjoy the moment at Etihad Stadium. He didn‚Äôt have the last laugh, though.

Substitute Raheem Sterling smashed home an 82nd-minute volley as City fought back for a 1-1 draw at Etihad Stadium after playing with 10 men for more than a half of a chaotic game on Monday.

The late equalizer slightly soured another landmark occasion for Rooney, the record scorer for England and United _ and now only the second player to reach a double-century of Premier League goals after Alan Shearer.

‚ÄúIt was a sweet moment,‚Äù he said, before adding with a smile: ‚ÄúI am sure the red half of Manchester will have enjoyed it as well.‚Äù

The 31-year-old Rooney is enjoying something of a career renaissance since leaving United in the offseason to return to his boyhood club. It‚Äôs now two goals in two league games for a player whose international career might not yet be over.

‚ÄúIt is not bad for someone who is not fit anymore and can‚Äôt get about the pitch,‚Äù Rooney said, taunting his critics. ‚ÄúI have always put a shift in for the team and tonight is no different.‚Äù

On his chances of a recall by England ahead of next month‚Äôs World Cup qualifiers, Rooney said: ‚ÄúI am focusing on Everton. I am sure I will speak to England manager Gareth Southgate over the next few days and we will see what happens.‚Äù

Rooney scored Everton‚Äôs goal against the run of play in the 35th minute, meeting Dominic Calvert-Lewin‚Äôs cross with a first-time shot that struck City goalkeeper Ederson Moraes‚Äô heel and deflected into the net off the post.

City was already getting frustrated by its failure to pierce a deep-lying and compact Everton defense, and its chances of victory further receded in the 44th when right back Kyle Walker was sent off for a second yellow card in the space of two minutes. The second booking looked harsh, with Walker barely brushing Mason Holgate‚Äôs midriff with his elbow as he backed into the Everton full back.

City manager Pep Guardiola didn‚Äôt want to talk about the incident, except to say: ‚ÄúIt was so clear.‚Äù Sterling gave City energy after coming on as a halftime substitute. And after smashing a glaring opportunity over the bar from close range, he made amends by meeting Holgate‚Äôs poor headed clearance with a sweetly struck left-footed volley from just inside the area.

Everton also finished the game with 10 men when holding midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin was red-carded in the 88th for his second booking. The draw left both teams on four points from two matches.

For City, there was delight in getting something out of the game after Walker‚Äôs dismissal on his home debut, but also a frustratingly familiar feeling to last season. They failed to convert a stream of opportunities until Sterling‚Äôs late intervention, and conceded from its first and only real chance given up.

The strike pairing of Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus didn‚Äôt appear to be on each other‚Äôs wavelength in the first half, and Jesus was substituted at halftime. Leroy Sane was uncomfortable at left wing back, giving the ball away before Rooney‚Äôs milestone goal.

Everton defended obdurately and in numbers, and almost made it five clean sheets in five competitive games this season. Rooney was denied a second straight winner _ he also scored in the 1-0 victory over Stoke last weekend and was clearly frustrated at the end of the game, picking up a booking for dissent.

Now, the chase is on to catch Shearer, who finished his career on 260 Premier League goals. ‚ÄúHe is still that player that every manager needs in his team,‚Äù Everton manager Ronald Koeman said of Rooney. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs that teacher for young players.‚Äù

(Source: Express File photo by Gurmeet Singh)

A day after Manminder Singh alias Mindhi, brother of slain gangster Rupinder Gandhi, was shot dead outside his residence in village Rasoolra of Khanna, a rival gangster, Gurjot Garcha, posted a Facebook status claiming that he and his accomplice, Harwinder alias Rinda Sandhu, were behind the killing. Garcha, a friend-turned-foe of Manminder, was once a part of Gandhi Students Union and the same gang. Later, he joined the gang of sarpanch Ravi Khwajke, who was gunned down at a marriage function on February 20, 2016.

In his Facebook status, Garcha said: ‚ÄúI want to tell everyone that I and my brother Rinda Sandhu are behind Mindhi‚Äôs murder. No one else is responsible for it.‚Äù He claimed that he killed Manminder because ‚Äúhe was using his brother Rupinder Gandhi‚Äôs name for cheap publicity‚Äù. He added that ‚ÄúManminder was also using his own friends and even appointing school children as union leaders at school-level just to gain cheap publicity‚Äù.

Garcha also issued a warning to the ‚Äúsympathisers of Manminder‚Äù and said that those who are feeling bad for him can leave comments on his post and he ‚Äúwill deal with them‚Äù. He asked police not to harass his other friends unnecessarily as he has revealed both the names involved in the killing. Khanna police has now added Garcha‚Äôs name to the FIR. SSP (Khanna) Navjot Mahal claimed that police had identified his role in the killing and it was only after he got to know about it, that he posted on Facebook.

"West Indies, Sri Lanka confirm tour to Pakistan for T20Is","Najam Sethi confirmed the tours by Sri Lanka and West Indies. (Source: AP) Najam Sethi confirmed the tours by Sri Lanka and West Indies. (Source: AP)

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday confirmed that the country will host two international teams as it tries to bring back international cricket to the country. Sri Lanka and West Indies have confirmed that they will travel to Pakistan to play T20 international in September and November respectively. The PCB confirmed this after announcing that a World XI side will be in Lahore to play three T20Is in October.

‚ÄúCricket West Indies and Pakistan Cricket Board are advancing discussions that will see the West Indies team play the T20 matches with Pakistan in Lahore in late November,‚Äù said a statement released by the PCB.

‚ÄúMy mission statement is to bring back international cricket to Pakistan and hopefully we will be able to announce the full World XI side in next two to three days,‚Äù PCB chairman Najam Sethi told a news conference.

Pakistan haven‚Äôt had a international season in their country since the 2009 terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team bus in Lahore. Though Zimbabwe did visit Pakistan two years ago, no Test playing nation has visited them.

But, the two tours will only go ahead after assessing the situation during the World XI tour which was first talked after the second edition of Pakistan Super League ended in March.

‚ÄúIt was a very difficult task convincing the Sri Lankan board to send their team to Lahore once again but they have shown great courage in accepting our request and hopefully if security arrangements are confirmed they will come and play T20 matches in October.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe will try to organise some matches of the Pakistan Super League in Karachi early next year so that we can start convincing teams to also play at other venues apart from Lahore,‚Äù he added.

"Donald Trump commits US to open-ended Afghanistan war, Taliban vow ‚Äògraveyard‚Äô: Top developments","U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, U.S., August 21, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, U.S., August 21, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday committed US troops to an open-ended war in Afghanistan, a decision the Afghanistan government welcomed. Taliban has, however, warned that this decision by the United States of America would make the country a ‚Äúgraveyard for the American empire‚Äù. Trump also vowed to step up military campaign against the Taliban. He also blamed Pakistan for harbouring terrorists in safe havens on its soil. US officials said Trump has signed off on Defense Secretary James Mattis‚Äô plans to despatch around 4,000 more troops to Afghanistan.

Here is what has happened in the past 24 hours:

1. In a statement to Reuters, US President Donald Trump said his original instinct was to pull out all US troops. But after a lengthy review with his military advisers about the US‚Äô longest war he was convinced.

2. ‚ÄúThe consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum that terrorists, including ISIS and al Qaeda, would instantly fill.‚Äù

3. Trump reiterated that although US‚Äô troops will fight to win, he asserted that eventually Afghanistan‚Äôs police and army must to most of the fighting to defeat the Taliban and allied Islamist militants. ‚ÄúThe stronger the Afghan security forces become, the less we will have to do. ‚Ä¶ We want them to succeed.‚Äù

4. Approximately 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan work closely with a NATO-led training and advising mission. The rest are a part of a counter-terror operation that mostly targets pockets of Al-Qaeda and Islamic State terrorists.

5. Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday welcomed the US strategy saying it would expand the training mission for Afghan forces. ‚ÄúI am grateful to President Trump and the American people for this affirmation of support ‚Ä¶ for our joint struggle to rid the region from the threat of terrorism,‚Äù Ghani said in a statement.

6. The Taliban condemned US President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision saying: ‚ÄúIf the U.S. does not pull all its forces out of Afghanistan, we will make this country the 21st century graveyard for the American empire.‚Äù

7. The United States-backed Afghanistan forces overthrew the Taliban‚Äôs hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 over its sheltering of al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, primary architect architect of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in U.S. cities that killed nearly 2,000 people.

8. US‚Äô involvement in the Afghanistan war has however created problems for three presidents. Around 2,400 US troops have been killed in action in Afghanistan ever since.

9. Trump asserted that he would not engage in nation building even as he warned that US‚Äô support ‚Äúis not a blank check‚Äù for Afghanistan‚Äôs corruption-plagued government.

10. Trump also slammed Pakistan for providing safe haven to terrorists. ‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens,‚Äù he said, referring to complaints that Taliban and other militants move freely in Pakistan.

Such is the case with her latest appearance at Manish Malhotra‚Äôs residence where she attended a party organised by the ace designer to celebrate his good friend, Sridevi‚Äôs birthday.

The Ae Dil Hai Mushkil star stepped out in a lovely toga-inspired grey shimmer gown by Gaurav Gupta featuring an embellished neckline. If you ask us, the gown ticks all the right boxes for a simple yet elegant evening look and we would have been really happy with her choice for the soir√©e. But there‚Äôs a catch! Celebrity stylist Aastha Sharma who has worked with Aishwarya on a number of occasions, including Cannes 2017 red carpet, spoiled the look with a chainmail necklace. We wish she would have picked up something sleek in its place, it would have looked much better.

However, we can‚Äôt find any fault with her beauty game. Her face looked gorgeous as usual with her signature well-defined eyes, a bright red pout and cascading waves.

This isn‚Äôt the first time the Indian beauty has ruined her look by going overboard with her styling. A couple of days back, while in Melbourne, Australia, she picked up a beautiful, custom-made embroidered suit by fashion designer Manish Malhotra. We loved her outfit but here too she ruined the look with too much make-up. Only if she would have toned it down a little.

Do you like her style quotient? Let us know in the comments below.

Johnson & Johnson asked to pay a record $417 million to ovarian cancer victim,"Bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder line a drugstore shelf in New York.(Reuters File Photo) Bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder line a drugstore shelf in New York.(Reuters File Photo)

A Los Angeles jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $ 417 million to a woman who claimed in a lawsuit that the talc in its iconic baby powder causes ovarian cancer when applied regularly for feminine hygiene. The lawsuit was brought by a California woman, Eva Echeverria, who alleged Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about the potential cancer risks of talcum powder.

Echeverria developed ovarian cancer as a ‚Äúproximate result of the unreasonably dangerous and defective nature of talcum powder,‚Äù Echeverria said in her lawsuit. Echeverria‚Äôs attorney, Mark Robinson, said his client hoped the verdict would lead Johnson & Johnson to include additional warnings on its products.

‚ÄúMrs. Echeverria is dying from this ovarian cancer and she said to me all she wanted to do was to help the other women throughout the whole country who have ovarian cancer for using Johnson & Johnson for 20 and 30 years,‚Äù Robinson said.

‚ÄúShe really didn‚Äôt want sympathy,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúShe just wanted to get a message out to help these other women.‚Äù Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said in a statement that the company will appeal the jury‚Äôs decision.

She says while the company sympathizes with those impacted by ovarian cancer, she says science supports the safety of Johnson‚Äôs baby powder.

A St Louis, Missouri jury in May awarded $110.5 million to a Virginia woman who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012.

She had blamed her illness on her use for more than 40 years of the company‚Äôs talcum powder-containing products. Besides that case, three other jury trials in St. Louis reached similar outcomes last year √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù issuing awards of $72 million, $ 70.1 million and $ 55 million, for a combined total of $ 307.6 million.

Goodrich said the company is preparing for additional trials in the US and will continue to defend the product‚Äôs safety.

"Anthony Martial is well integrated with the little French group in the team, says Jose Mourinho","Manchester United‚Äôs Paul Pogba celebrates scoring their third goal with Anthony Martial. (Source: Reuters) Manchester United‚Äôs Paul Pogba celebrates scoring their third goal with Anthony Martial. (Source: Reuters)

After talks about Anthony Martial‚Äôs future with Manchester United being in doubt, Jose Mourinho said that the former Monaco player is developing the right attitude and that they are using him well. He also added that French connection in the team is helping Martial feel integrated.

Mourinho was quoted by the Daily Mail on Monday as saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre using him well and he‚Äôs coming with the right attitude. We had a conversation about the future he has here. Of course he wants to play, of course he wants to start, of course he wants to be selected for the national team, of course he wants to go to the World Cup, so that‚Äôs good.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd for me it‚Äôs simple. I can‚Äôt play Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and EFL Cup with 11 players, I need a squad. I think he has a good connection on the pitch with Paul (Pogba), with Romelu (Lukaku). I think he‚Äôs growing in confidence and, of course, two periods of 20 minutes and he‚Äôs scored two goals, so for his confidence it‚Äôs good.‚Äù

Mourinho added that the French connection among Marouane Fellaini, Pogba, Lukaku and Martial has helped the forward feel well integrated. He added: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs working really well. Maybe that French language little group we have ‚Äì Fellaini, Paul, Lukaku ‚Äì is a group where he‚Äôs very well integrated now and they bring him up.‚Äù

‚ÄúHis professional level has improved, he‚Äôs working much, much better, so we are happy. We have lots of hopes with him and obviously he has to be happy now, and he can only improve.‚Äù

United have had a good start to the season, beating both West Ham and Swansea City 4-0 to sit at the top of the table. Mourinho, however, said that they are not getting carried away with the wins.

Liquor licence cancelled: Pune baner restaurant starts ‚ÄòPay as You Please‚Äô policy,"On August 4, the district collector issued an order, cancelling liquor licences of two major joints ‚Äî Effingut Brewerkz (above) and Teddy Boy ‚Äî at Deron Heights. On August 4, the district collector issued an order, cancelling liquor licences of two major joints ‚Äî Effingut Brewerkz (above) and Teddy Boy ‚Äî at Deron Heights.

WEEKS AFTER the district collector cancelled its liquor licence, even as another pub continues to operate at Deron Heights, Baner, restaurant Effingut Brewerkz has hit back with a ‚ÄòPay as You Please‚Äô offer from August 21, Monday. On August 4, the collector had issued an order, cancelling liquor licences of two major joints ‚Äî Effingut Brewerkz and Teddy Boy ‚Äî at Deron Heights.

The order was issued after several months of protests by residents of Baner‚Äôs Pallod Farms Phase 1. The residents had started a ‚ÄòNo Bar at my Dwar‚Äô campaign against several outlets in the building, which falls under their vicinity. However, while liquor licences of the two pubs were cancelled, citing that their ‚Äúoperations are creating problems like parking in the neighbourhood‚Äù, operations at The Irish Village ‚Äî another pub on the same premise ‚Äî remain unaffected.

Terming the order as ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù, Manu Gulati, owner of Effingut Brewerkz, has now appealed to his patrons to save the restaurant from shutting down. ‚ÄúWe are currently fighting two battles. One, a legal one, of our rights, that of our random and discriminatory cancellation of the liqour licence. Second, a tougher one, that of our very survival. With about 100 employees, other costs like rent, staff meals, accommodation, raw material, electricity, maintenance, operations, everyday is a struggle in terms of meeting costs. To counter this, with a hope to survive, we are doing something that probably hasn‚Äôt been done before. Presenting ‚ÄòPay as You Please‚Äô. Order as much as you want from the menu and pay as you please,‚Äù read his Facebook post.

Speaking to Pune Newsline, Gulati said it was the only way he saw the restaurant surviving after the drop in business over the last fortnight. Stating that his pub is essentially known as a place for premium beers and drinks, the footfall at the restaurant has gone down sharply. ‚ÄúWe are having less than two tables occupancy over the last few days for dinner. I have 93 staffers, how will we manage? Luckily, no one has left so far but the worry is written on their faces. We are primarily a place that serves the best of beers, but our food is also very well appreciated. Hence, we have put out this appeal to our patrons, who have always supported us, to bring us out of this till our licence comes back, because we won‚Äôt give up. We will fight this discrimination,‚Äù said Gulati.

He added, ‚ÄúWe have a monthly goal, which is their bare minimum target to survive. This would be constantly displayed on the screens, for all to know, so the patrons are aware of the restaurant‚Äôs battle for survival.‚Äù On their legal fight, Gulati said an appeal is now pending before the excise commissioner. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt get a satisfactory response, we would approach the excise minister as well,‚Äù he added.

Dawood Ibrahim on UK asset freeze list with 3 Pakistan addresses; 21 aliases,"Dawood Ibrahim is the main accused in the 1993 serial bomb blasts case in which around 260 people were killed. Dawood Ibrahim is the main accused in the 1993 serial bomb blasts case in which around 260 people were killed.

Mastermind of 1993 Mumbai serial blast and India‚Äôs most wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim remains the only ‚ÄúIndian national‚Äù on the list of financial sanctions released by the UK which also listed 21 aliases for the underworld don. In the UK Treasury department‚Äôs ‚ÄòConsolidated List of Financial Sanctions Targets in the UK‚Äô which was updated on Monday, Dawood appears with three recorded addresses in Pakistan, where he is reportedly based.

‚ÄúKaskar Dawood Ibrahim‚Äù is recorded to have lived at: House No 37, 30th Street ‚Äì Defence Housing Authority, Karachi, Pakistan; Noorabad, Karachi, Pakistan (Palatial bungalow in the hilly area); and White House, Near Saudi Mosque, Clifton, Karachi, Pakistan.

A fourth address on record until last year ‚Äì House no.29, Margalla Road, F 6/2 Street no.22, Karachi, Pakistan ‚Äì is no

longer part of the records. His place of birth is recorded as Kher, Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, and his nationality is listed as ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù with a recorded Indian passport which was subsequently revoked by the government of India and then goes on to list a string of Indian and Pakistani passports acquired by him and misused.

‚ÄúFather‚Äôs name is Sheikh Ibrahim Ali Kaskar, Mother‚Äôs name is Amina Bi, Wife‚Äôs name is Mehjabeen Shaikh. Also referred to as Hizrat and Mucchad,‚Äù the listing on Ibrahim, first made on November 7, 2003, notes.

Dawood is the main accused in the 1993 serial bomb blasts case in which around 260 people were killed, and more than 700 suffered injuries. He fled the country post the bombings and is understood to be hiding in Pakistan. Pakistan has repeatedly denied his presence in the country.

The listing also records 21 aliases used by Ibrahim: Abdul, Shaikh, Ismail; Abdul Aziz, Abdul Hamid; Abdul Rehman, Shaikh, Mohd, Ismail; Anis, Ibrahim, Shaikh, Mohd; Bhai, Bada; Bhai, Dawood; Bhai, Iqbal; Dilip, Aziz; Ebrahim, Dawood; Farooqi, Sheikh; Hasan, Kaskar, Dawood; Hassan, Dawood; Ibrahim, Anis; Ibrahim, Dowood, Hassan, Shaikh; Kaskar, Daud, Hasan, Shaikh, Ibrahim; Kaskar, Daud, Ibrahim, Memon; Kaskar, Dawood, Hasan, Ibrahim; Memon, Dawood, Ibrahim; Sabri, Dawood; Sahab, Haji; and Seth, Bada.

The financial sanctions list also included organisations such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Khalistan

Zindabad Force and Hizbul Mujahideen. A series of affiliates of ‚ÄòAl-Qaeda‚Äô and the ‚ÄòIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant‚Äô are also recorded on the list.

Financial sanctions in force could apply to individuals, entities and governments who may be resident in the UK or abroad. The measures include prohibiting the transfer of funds to a sanctioned country and freezing the assets of a government, the corporate entities and residents of the target country to targeted asset freezes on individuals/entities.

Certain financial sanctions may also prohibit providing or performing other financial services, such as insurance, to designated individuals or governments. It is a criminal offence to breach a financial sanction, without an appropriate licence or authorisation from the UK Treasury.

Border Dispatch,"Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan.

Meena Menon was The Hindu‚Äôs correspondent in Islamabad for only nine months (August, 2013 to May, 2014) before she was kicked out. It is astonishing to learn from this memoir of how, in such a short time, her empathetic interest in anything and everything Pakistani enabled her to rise well above routine reporting (and routine harassment) to range across virtually the entire gamut of life as it is actually lived in that ‚Äúdistant neighbour‚Äù of ours.

Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. With a keen eye, a sharp ear, an open mind and a large heart, she kept in good cheer whatever the hurdles, made numerous friends, met everyone from top politicians to the proverbial taxi driver, wandered the by-lanes, shopped in different markets, explored the eating places, and did the sights, going to mosques and temples and churches around the capital.

Of course, she filed her regular reports, dutifully attended foreign office briefings, and informed her readers of political events and the proceedings in the National Assembly (Parliament). But she also immersed herself into Pakistan‚Äôs rich cultural life, interacted with artistes, painters, writers, social workers, political activists, fellow-journalists, and, of course, the aam admi. Instead of only obsessing over the India-Pakistan relationship, as many Indian reporters and most Indian diplomats do, it was Pakistan as a nation and a society, and Pakistanis as a people, who interested her. And, amusingly, she never allowed her minders, the two security guys who relentlessly trailed her (and whom she nick-named ‚ÄúBeard‚Äù and ‚ÄúChubby‚Äù) to faze her or derail her from her purpose.

This is what makes this book so special: it takes in all the political and economic see-saw in Pakistan itself, and in our relationship with Pakistan, but rising above both the pride and the prejudice that often overwhelm our perceptions of that country, she unhesitatingly presents both the warts and the astonishing resilience of a people fighting fierce odds.

‚ÄúI could walk around,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúand meet nice people‚Äù. ‚ÄúI had many friends and they were always helpful and kind‚Äù. She talks of ‚Äúa senior politician who treated me like his daughter‚Äù. ‚ÄúMany parliamentarians were friendly,‚Äù she remarks, ‚Äúeven if they made anti-Indian statements.‚Äù A startling revelation is that ‚Äúone place we felt quite welcome was the foreign office‚Äù! Elsewhere, she remarks, ‚Äúthis unconditional affection and warmth is overwhelming‚Äù. ‚ÄúPakistani writers and journalists were always accessible‚Äù and ‚Äúhelped me understand their country‚Äù. She names a whole sheaf of them. She recounts her encounters with the wife of a Pakistani army general, Indu Mitha, who teaches ‚ÄúBharatanatyam to enthusiastic Pakistanis‚Äù and Shenaz Minallah who, despite an attempt to burn down her headquarters, continues to run the Pakistan branch of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar‚Äôs ‚ÄúArt of Living‚Äù: ‚ÄúWe do courses in mostly three cities and from twenty-odd people the number has swelled to over eighty per session‚Äù. There is a moving account of her friendship with the great Sufi singer, Abida Parveen, who says of her hopes for India and Pakistan: ‚ÄúLove is a force, it‚Äôs like the sea, it cannot break‚Äù. She interviews the Baloch Gandhi, Mama Qadeer, the proximate cause of her expulsion. And she admires Shoaib Sultan Khan, a development activist, ‚ÄúThe Man from Pakistan‚Äù, who has done outstanding rural development work in Andhra Pradesh. She records, without further comment, Shoaib‚Äôs assessment of Rahul Gandhi who was much taken with his work: ‚Äúthis young man has his heart in the right place to do something for the poor‚Äù.

She contrasts ‚Äúmost of the media portrayal reinforcing the image of a backward and failed state‚Äù with ‚Äúvisitors (who) are pleasantly surprised when they see glimpses of a country that is different from what they think it is.‚Äù While surveying the many vicious disabilities to which the minorities are subjected (the Ahmedias are the worst treated, ‚Äúthe community lives on the razor‚Äôs edge‚Äù) she also finds space for ‚ÄúPandit Chamanlal from Rawalpindi‚Äù asserting, somewhat startlingly, that ‚Äúthe Hindu community was not targeted in any way‚Äù.

Yet, she is no starry-eyed romantic. She sees the downside clearly: the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù and its connections to terrorism; the persecution of Baloch dissidents and the atrocities inflicted on them; the blatant misuse of blasphemy laws; the sickening treatment of people with different sexual orientations; the awful collateral damage caused by drones; the soaring crime rate. There are graphic descriptions of suicide bomb blasts in the heart of Islamabad to which she was personal witness; and grim stories of mindless cruelty, murder and mayhem.

Her undiluted admiration is reserved for Pakistani journalists. ‚ÄúJournalists can be shot, kidnapped, threatened and abused‚Ä¶life hung on a thread‚Äù. Yet, ‚Äújournalism in Pakistan has been bold and brave‚Äù. She concludes, ‚ÄúThe government and the security empire have the upper hand. Yet, with all the powers at their command, they have not crushed the free spirit of the people who write and report at will‚Äù.

Meena Menon was unceremoniously thrown out of Pakistan in under a year. She harbours no bitterness. Balanced as ever, she remarks, of herself and the treatment meted out to Pak journalists in India: ‚Äúthere is no low both countries cannot stoop to.‚Äù Her final message is: ‚Äúthere is a call for peace and reason, however faint it may be, and it is coming from an invisible majority which is yet to come into its own‚Äù.

Sergio Ramos asks for more leniency from referees after red card record,"Out of Sergio Ramos‚Äôs 23 red cards, 18 have come in the La Liga, three were shown in the Champions League and two in the King‚Äôs Cup. (Source: Reuters) Out of Sergio Ramos‚Äôs 23 red cards, 18 have come in the La Liga, three were shown in the Champions League and two in the King‚Äôs Cup. (Source: Reuters)

Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos believes English referees are more lenient than their Spanish counterparts and has asked La Liga match officials to take a leaf out of the Premier League book after being sent off in Sunday‚Äôs 3-0 win at Deportivo La Coruna.

The captain earned a second booking in injury time for elbowing Deportivo‚Äôs Borja Valle while challenging for an aerial ball, adding to the yellow card he received in the second half for slapping Fabian Schar in an off-the-ball scuffle.

‚ÄúIn some areas we need to look more at English football and let the players play on more, I like their system better. In Europe referees are more tolerant,‚Äù Ramos, who received the 23rd red card of his Real Madrid career, told reporters.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with the (second) yellow card, it was harsh, but I respect the opinion of the referee. I have no intention of hurting him, I just supported myself, but you learn from everything.‚Äù

Explaining the first incident with Schar, which occurred when Deportivo‚Äôs Zakaria Bakkali player was injured on the floor, Ramos added: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt kick the ball out because they didn‚Äôt do it (earlier in the game).

‚ÄúThey ran after me, Schar headbutted me and all I did was push him out the way without trying to hurt him.‚Äù Ramos is Real‚Äôs most sent off player, with former defender Fernando Hierro trailing way behind on 12 red cards.

Out of Ramos‚Äôs 23 red cards, 18 have come in the La Liga, three were shown in the Champions League and two in the King‚Äôs Cup. The centre back, however, has never been dismissed in 143 games for Spain.

Five players were sent off in eight Liga games over the weekend, compared to two in nine Premier League games.

IIM-Ahmedabad receives fresh wave of Rs 15.5 crore restoration fund,"IIM Ahmedabad campus. File photo IIM Ahmedabad campus. File photo

The Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) on Monday announced that it has received a fresh wave of Rs 15.5 crore as funds, for conservation and restoration of its heritage campus in the city. The institute said it has so far received Rs 47.5 crore that will help restore almost one-third of the campus that have traditional red-brick structures designed by legendary American architect Louis I Kahn.

The fresh wave of funding is largely from the institute‚Äôs alumni. ‚ÄúWe have so far received Rs 47.5 crore as funds towards restoring our heritage campus. This includes a fresh round of funding of Rs 15.5 crore from Pankaj Patel, group chairman Zydus Group and a board member of IIMA, Sukumar Srinivas, founder and MD of Shankara Building Products, PP Gupta an alumnus of PGP 1974 batch and another alumnus from PGP 1883 batch. Two others which include the PGP 1982 batch and an alumnus couple have donated for restoring classrooms number two and five, respectively,‚Äù said Ashish Nanda, director of IIMA.

Over five lakh square feet of restoration work is being undertaken at the heritage campus of the IIM-A which includes the Louis Kahn Plaza, the Vikram Sarabhai Library and other spaces. So far restoration work of five classrooms, four dormitories, and Vikram Sarabhai Library have started.

‚ÄúOf the estimated five lakh square feet of restoration works that we are looking at, we can say that we have received funding for 1.5 lakh square feet which is almost one-third of the requirement,‚Äù said Commander Major Bhatt (Retired), Chief Administrative Officer, of IIMA.

According to the Bhatt, the structures in the heritage campus are over 45 years old and have developed cracks. The heritage structure consisting of the Louis Kahn Plaza, 14 dormitories, faculty wing, seminar rooms, program offices and others are yet to receive funding for restoration and conservation work. Officials said that the restoration work of the Vikram Sarabhai Library ‚Äî being funded by TCS ‚Äî will be completed by the beginning of next year.

The officials could not, however, put an estimate on the total amount of funds that would be needed to restore the structures within the heritage campus.

Ludhiana City Centre scam fictional; CM innocent: Vigilance Bureau,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh. (File) Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh. (File)

IN ITS closure report submitted in the Ludhiana court in the alleged Rs 1,144-crore Ludhiana City Centre scam, the Vigilance Bureau has concluded that ‚Äúthere is no proof or fact to substantiate any scam in the project‚Äù and that ‚ÄúCM Captain Amarinder Singh never had any ill-intention in the execution of the project‚Äù.

In the 77-page report, which The Indian Express has seen, submitted 10 years after the FIR was filed in the case in 2007, the VB says that ‚Äúin fact, Captain Amarinder Singh pointed out the irregularities in the project from time to time, keeping in view the welfare of the people and corrected them‚Äù. The report also says that ‚Äúthere is no proof of any bribe money exchanged between the representatives of the private firm, Today Homes, and any government official at the Hotel Park Plaza of Ludhiana‚Äù as alleged.

At least three times, the probe report says, ‚ÄúLudhiana City Centre was a huge project‚Äù and ‚ÄúLIT chairman Paramjit Singh Sibia did not have proper knowledge on how to handle the project‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhenever there were some minor irregularities, Captain Amarinder Singh issued orders to correct them and himself ordered probe into them. Thus he never had any ill-intentions. He followed the law at every step,‚Äù says the report.

It concludes by saying: ‚ÄúThere is no evidence to say that Captain Amarinder Singh was in connivance with the owners of Today Homes or acted to benefit or favour them.‚Äù The report concludes that ‚Äúno evidence has been found against any of the persons named and neither there is any proof of any bungling or scam in Ludhiana City Centre‚Äù. ‚ÄúAll allegations are just fictional (kalpanik) and sambhavit (doubtful).‚Äù

The FIR in the alleged scam was filed on March 23, 2007, on the complaint of SSP Vigilance, Ludhiana. After an investigation, a charge sheet was filed in the court on December 12, 2007, but the court had not framed charges against the accused over the last 10 years and the matter kept getting adjourned. The closure report was filed on Saturday. The re-investigation on which the closure report has been filed was carried out after Chetan Gupta, an accused named in the FIR, filed an application with the VB on March 7, this year.

The Bureau‚Äôs closure report contradicts its own probe report filed earlier by then SP, Vigilance, Ludhiana, Kanwarjit Singh Sadhu, on the basis of which an FIR was filed on March 23, 2007, against 36 people, including Captain Amarinder Singh, his son Raninder Singh, son-in-law Raminder Singh, former LIT chairman Paramjit Singh Sibia (now dead), former local bodies minister Chaudhary Jagjit Singh (now dead), former Punjab Congress chief HS Hanspal and others.

The fresh vigilance report says its own officials ‚Äúdid not investigate properly earlier‚Äù and now in the ‚Äúwake of new facts, documents and proofs‚Äù, it has been found that ‚Äúthere is no proof of irregularity in the project‚Äù and ‚Äúnone of the persons named in the FIR had any ill-intention‚Äù.

"Kalimpong blast: ‚ÄòMiscreants did recee before attack‚Äô, police conduct raids","Officials investigate the blast site after an explosion near a motor-stand in Darjeeling on Saturday. (PTI Photo) Officials investigate the blast site after an explosion near a motor-stand in Darjeeling on Saturday. (PTI Photo)

Police suspect that miscreants did a recce before carrying out the grenade blast at Kalimpong police station that killed a civic volunteer and injured two others on Saturday night. Sources in the police said they have collected CCTV footages and are trying to identify the accused. The CID and forensic experts have already collected chemical samples of the grenade after the explosion.

‚ÄúWe suspect that the miscreants did a recce before the bomb was hurled at the police station. We are conducting raids,‚Äù SP (Kalimpong) Ajit Kumar Yadav told The Indian Express.

Sources said that the hand grenade was of high-intensity. ‚ÄúA specific material called ‚Äònitrogeletin‚Äô was used in an improvised metal pipe. It was of such a high intensity that the splinters were found 30 meters away from the blast spot,‚Äù said a source.

The technique of the explosion, sources said, was archaic. It was exploded non-electrically like how petrol bombs are burnt during festive season. A fuse was used to initiate the detonation of the grenade, they said. Sources said that though they suspect Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leaders behind the explosion, a breakthrough in the case will only be achieved after the police are able to identify the two motorcycle-borne miscreants captured in the CCTV cameras near the police station.

GJM chief Bimal Gurung and four other party leaders have been booked under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for the grenade blast. The UAPA had already been slapped against Gurung after a blast in Darjeeling‚Äôs Chowkbazar on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday.

Spanish police searching for van driver in Barcelona attack,"Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain‚Äôs King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain‚Äôs King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

Spanish police were on Saturday searching for the driver of a van that ploughed into a crowd in Barcelona, killing 13 people, in one of two deadly attacks in Catalonia carried out by a network of suspected Islamist militants. The van driver has yet to be identified, police in the northeastern Spanish region said late on Friday, but said it seemed increasingly unlikely that he was one of five suspects shot dead in a Catalan seaside resort.

The driver abandoned the van and fled on Thursday after speeding along a section of Las Ramblas, the most famous boulevard in Barcelona, leaving a trail of dead and injured among the crowds of tourists and local residents. Another woman died after a car rammed passersby in the resort town of Cambrils in the early hours of Friday, before police shot dead five attackers who were wearing fake explosive belts and had an axe and knives in the vehicle.

Police have arrested four people in connection with the attacks ‚Äì three Moroccans and a citizen of Spain‚Äôs North African enclave of Melilla. Another three people have been identified but are still at large. Spanish media said two of them may have been killed in Alcanar, where a house was razed by an explosion shortly before midnight on Wednesday, while one suspect, named by El Pais newspaper as Younes Abouyaaqoub, was still sought by police.

Spanish police declined to confirm his identity. They believe the house in Alcanar was being used to plan one or several large-scale attacks in Barcelona, possibly using a large number of butane gas canisters stored there. More than 100 people were injured in the Las Ramblas attack, many of them foreign tourists visiting Barcelona during the peak of the summer season.

In the past 13 months, militants have used vehicles as weapons to kill nearly 130 people in France, Germany, Britain, Sweden and Spain. The Spanish government will decide on Saturday whether to raise its security alert one notch to the maximum level, which could involve armed forces being deployed to help patrol cities and vulnerable areas.

I&B ministry changes IFFI panel amid film screenings,"Union Minister Smriti Irani (File) Union Minister Smriti Irani (File)

The Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Monday changed the International Film Festival of India‚Äôs (IFFI) preview committee, when the screenings for the festival were mid-way. The new, larger preview committee announced through an order, will have 40 members, removing almost everyone from the previous committee. Vivek Agnihotri is the convenor of the new committee. On August 12, he was appointed to the board of Central Board of Film Certification as well, after Pahlaj Nihalani was replaced by Prasoon Joshi as the chairman.

Prasoon Joshi is also part of IFFI‚Äôs steering committee announced on August 18. Agnihotri‚Äôs wife, Pallavi Joshi, has also been appointed to the preview committee. Till last year, the IFFI‚Äôs preview committee used to be constituted every year, with a few changes among members. But last year M Venkaiah Naidu decided to set up the committee for a three-year period to give it continuity.

The members had already sat through one schedule of screenings, watching nearly 150 movies in July-end and early August. The committee, divided into three panels of seven members each, was supposed to reconvene after Independence Day. But the members were informed through email that the second schedule to watch the movies to select for IFFI has been postponed. NO reason was given.

One of the members of the older preview committee told The Indian Express that though it is the minister‚Äôs prerogative to change the committee members ‚Äúit should not have been done mid-way‚Äù. Members had been unofficially told by the Directorate of Film Festivals that I&B minister Smriti Irani wanted to change the committee. The sitting fee and the travel allowance that each member is entitled to was increased this year after over a decade. Till last year, each member used to get Rs 100 per film they watched and Rs 100 as a daily travel allowance. Since this year, the rates were increased to Rs 500 per film a member watches and Rs 1,000 as daily travel allowance. This was done before Irani took over.

Sources said that till a few years ago the festival used to get about 500 to 600 movies every year. But in the last two to three years, the number of entries has gone up, and most entries now come online. This year the number of entries is believed to be over 1,000.

When Glasgow hosted longest World Badminton Championship match ever,"The previous badminton venue of this city is memorable on its own, but it was in the badminton that grit got added to glory. The previous badminton venue of this city is memorable on its own, but it was in the badminton that grit got added to glory.

The Emirates Arena is all glass and chrome and cutting edge and eminently successful for India‚Äôs men‚Äôs singles players who won gold and bronze at the Commonwealth Games three years ago. But it will take a classic at this World Championship for Glaswegians to forget the last epic that played out in the city.

Five miles west of the Emirates Arena is the beautiful red sandstone with a grand piazza entrance of the Kelvin Hall. The previous badminton venue of this city is memorable on its own, but it was in the badminton that grit got added to glory.

The finals of the World Championships in 1997 starred the longest Worlds match ever where ‚ÄòEuropean‚Äô Peter Rasmussen beat ‚ÄòAsian‚Äô Sun Jun. The two apparently hadn‚Äôt spoken much with each other prior to the two-hour-four-minute long 16-17, 18-13, 15-10 marathon. But they became thick friends after the Dane outlasted the cramping Chinese in what is considered the greatest final in badminton history.

Even though no placard exists to mark the moment, the Kelvin Hall is no different from Court 18 at Wimbledon. The Chinese was leading, before he started cramping and was treated twice while all Rasmussen had to do was keep the shuttle away. It might be the first time a European had beaten a Chinese in a major final, though wickedly the Dane‚Äôs coach had been a Chinese as well.

One Chinese who got his opponents to a literal standstill was Lin Dan in 2005 at the London World Championships. ‚ÄúBoth Peter Gade and Lee Chong Wei collapsed backstage, the latter hobbling out and refusing to do a PC,‚Äù a veteran hack covering the All Engalnd recalls. Lin was pointedly told his age (33) on Sunday ‚Äî inquiring about their plans for retirement.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be 34 actually, and Lee Chong Wei 35,‚Äù Lin said cheekily, ‚Äúand we want to make badminton the greatest sport in the world.‚Äù The Kelvin Hall has had its fill; perhaps a classic will play out this time should the two meet in the final at the Emirates.

Just as well, Srikanth & Co have trained for longer games.

Congress hopes its 15 years in power enough,"Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken (ANI) Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken (ANI)

For the Congress, the Bawana bypoll is an opportunity to reverse its fortunes in Delhi. The seat, after all, is one where the Congress held sway for 15 years. Victory here, party leaders explained, is key. Leaving no stone unturned, the party‚Äôs last day of campaigning saw 60 corner meetings, six padyatras and door-to-door campaigns.

Attacking the AAP and the BJP, Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken said, ‚ÄúNeither the BJP at the Centre, nor the three corporations, nor the Delhi government has done any work here during the past year. Only the Congress has done work here in the past 15 years.‚Äù The Congress also claimed that AAP MLA Ved Prakash joining the BJP was mirrored by the induction of former BJP MLA Gugan Singh into AAP.

As part of their campaign strategy, senior leaders explained that the party had divided the assembly constituency into 111 sectors. ‚ÄúEach sector was put under the charge of senior leaders and Congress workers, who made door-to-door visits to make people aware of the development work carried out by the party when it was in power,‚Äù a senior leader said.

The party‚Äôs candidate, three-time MLA Surender Kumar, focused on his past tenure during his campaign. During a door-to-door visit at Krishna Vihar, he said, ‚ÄúEveryone here knows the work that I have done; it speaks for itself. If I win, I promise to expedite the development work which has stopped since 2013.‚Äù

Rajinder Sharma, a resident of Bawana, said, ‚ÄúThe Congress is a known entity. We have given a chance to AAP and suffered. Now the AAP‚Äôs candidate is contesting elections from the BJP. We won‚Äôt make the same mistake again.‚Äù Apart from Maken and Kumar, former MP Sajjan Kumar, MP Deepender Hooda and former Delhi MLA Shoaib Iqbal were also present during campaigning.

The way back home: Will we ever be the India that was envisioned?,"The eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it. The eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it.

Reena Kallat Synapse, Single channel video projection, 2011

Studies say that the eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it and no two people see anything exactly alike. We create meaning through a mental bridge that the mind forms to complete gaps.

My video Synapse is an ironic play on legibility, where we witness 14 individuals‚Äô attempts at reading the letters on a Snellen chart at an ophthalmologist‚Äôs clinic. The traditional Snellen (eye chart), meant to measure visual acuity, in this case happens to have been replaced by a variation comprising the fragmented letters of the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, which commences with ‚ÄúWe the people of India‚Ä¶‚Äù Each person tries to make sense of the alphabets before them with hesitations and uncertainties, interrupted recurrently with change of lenses and monotonous questions regarding clarity of vision. Their pauses seem less about the limitations of their vision, and, instead, appear to metaphorically demonstrate an ordinary citizen‚Äôs blurred view of the most inclusive document of the nation.

Some of these ideas have preoccupied me for years and I‚Äôve made several works that refer to the Preamble of the Constitution of India to examine our role as citizens vis-a-vis the republic. Through this video I made in 2011, I reflect upon our own limitations in understanding our responsibilities that come along with the freedom promised through the Constitution and how we choose to interpret it. Nearly 70 years after the fundamental principles of the Constitution were first laid down, we are far from having achieved these values. Fulfilling these can, perhaps, only be made possible if we collectively strive towards attaining them rather than allowing ourselves to be divided as a people, by being fooled into believing that these would be provided for.

Samit Das, Bibliography in Progress, 2016

History depends on archaeology and its excavation, on myths and archives. For a long time now, I have been looking at history not just as an unchangeable culture or a particular person‚Äôs assumption/ studies, but as a documentation of the growth process of society through a contemporary approach. History should be open for everyone to understand and interpret.

It is the same with art. One cannot be contemporary if one denies history. In the series ‚ÄòBibliography in Progress‚Äô, I have looked at the Harappan civilization and I am working with images from the Constitution of India for another set. I attained a copy of the Illustrated Constitution published in 2000/2001, and am looking at the illustrations done by Nandalal Bose and his students. It is difficult to say if we are the India that our Constitution promised ‚Äî there are various dimensions, and, something might be right according to one person and wrong according to other. All of these point to a multi-layered thought process intrinsic to a democracy.

Venkat Shyam, Freedom, acrylic on canvas, 2016

We have a long way to go before we become the India that was envisioned, where everyone is equal and enjoys liberty and justice. This particular work discusses gender equality and shows a woman walking hand-in-hand with a man. We speak of equality between men and women, but that is hardly a reality. A woman has to carry the burden of household responsibilities, despite whatever work she does outside her home. In this image, she has the globe inside her, representing the universe, but also a scorpion crawling on her, depicting her daily struggles.

LN Tallur, Eraser Pro, bronze, 2012

We are living in times when personal greed is overtaking the ideas that our society was built on. This erasure is, of course, incomplete, dependent as it is on the demands of that hour. For instance, we save things on the computer, but when we want to remove the data from the hard disk, maintaining privacy is not as simple as it may have seemed at first. The first thought is that when you ‚Äúdelete‚Äù the file, the data is gone. Not quite ‚Äî it only removes the reference of the file from the file system table. The file remains on the disk and can be retrieved. Similarly, we are aware of the values and principles that we have inherited, but are choosing to ignore them.

Riyas Komu, Fourth World, terracotta installation, 2017

The Lion Capital from the Buddhist tradition is one of the best images any nation can have to represent its diversity, multiculturalism and secularism. It represents the four dimensions that India as a country has always upheld, and that is something I have always enjoyed in the symbolism.

We are getting a feeling that this symbolism is crumbling. The four dimensions represent the ‚Äúunity in diversity‚Äù that our Constitution enshrines. Though we do not see the fourth dimension, its presence is there, always unified with the other three and that was the strength of this republic. Conceptually, when this unity breaks, when we are no longer able to rely on the unseen fourth dimension, that‚Äôs when the anxieties of the State, and political and administrative processes surface. We‚Äôre excluded from these, making it easier for power structures to erase cultural differences and instill ideas of homogenisation in its citizens.

ISIS used Wales companies to finance terror: Report,"The FBI disclosures will raise fears about the likelihood of further attacks in Europe. (File/Photo) The FBI disclosures will raise fears about the likelihood of further attacks in Europe. (File/Photo)

The Islamic State terror group has used a network of companies operating out of Wales in the UK to finance terror plots, including the recent attacks in Spain, a media report said on Sunday. In an incident in Barcelona, a white van sped down the popular Las Ramblas avenue packed full of tourists on August 17, knocking people down and killing 13. Then just eight hours later, attackers struck again at an seaside resort of Cambrils in Spain where a car rammed into pedestrians, injuring six civilians and a police officer. One of the civilians later died.

FBI documents seen by ‚ÄòThe Sunday Times‚Äô reveal that surveillance technology dispatched to Spain is believed to be linked to the development by the terror group of weaponised drones routed through the UK. Other purchases said to be routed through Cardiff in Wales include orders for ‚Äúbug sweep units‚Äù and software to help launch rockets.

US court documents seen by the newspaper show the lengths to which individuals involved with the Wales companies went to mask their alleged activities. One of the firms ‚Äî which shipped surveillance equipment to Madrid, Spain ‚Äî appears to have been set up using the identity of a bogus director and shareholder called ‚ÄúPeter Soren‚Äù.

The name is believed to be an alias for Siful Sujan, a Bangladesh-origin IT expert and businessman behind the companies who left south Wales three years ago with his family to join the ISIS in Syria. He was later killed by a US drone strike in Raqqa, the terror group‚Äôs de facto capital.

Sujan and his associates originally set up the Ibacs network of companies to offer website and printing services to restaurants and takeaways. They operated out of an office on Alexandra Gate business park at Tremorfa in Cardiff.

But a probe involving the FBI in the US and British anti-terrorist police discovered that some of the companies became involved in more sinister activities after Sujan headed to Syria, where he was a senior figure in ISIS hacking operations and weapons development.

One of the Cardiff-based firms, Ibacstel Electronics, was used to send a total of USD 7,700 in 2015 to an ISIS supporter in Maryland, US, called Mohamed Elshinaway, 32, who pleaded guilty to terrorism charges last week.

In July 2015 a company called Advance Technology Global (ATG) was created and registered at the Alexandra Gate business address, the FBI claims.

Transcripts of a Skype conversation between Sujan and another Ibacs director in Cardiff obtained by the FBI reveal that Sujan was the real brains behind ATG. Sujan came to the UK to study in 2003 and was followed by his wife, Akter, two years later.

They had a son, Amanul, in 2011 and lived in Pontypridd, but later moved to a rented townhouse in Cardiff, close to the Alexandra Gate business park. The couple briefly moved back to Bangladesh before travelling to Turkey with their son.

Ibacstel Electronics was dissolved in March 2016 and ATG was wound up eight months ago. Other Ibacs-linked firms continue to operate out of a new office in Newport but there is no suggestion that they are involved in any wrongdoing, the newspaper said.

The FBI disclosures will raise fears about the likelihood of further attacks in Europe.

"Free speech supporters: Outnumbered, but rally was a success","Thousands of demonstrators marched Saturday from the city‚Äôs Roxbury neighborhood to Boston Common, where the ‚ÄúFree Speech Rally‚Äù was held. (AP Photo) Thousands of demonstrators marched Saturday from the city‚Äôs Roxbury neighborhood to Boston Common, where the ‚ÄúFree Speech Rally‚Äù was held. (AP Photo)

Supporters of a small, conservative ‚Äúfree speech rally‚Äù held in Boston said that despite being outnumbered by tens of thousands of counter-protesters, their event was a success.

Demonstrators protesting against racism and white supremacy had descended upon historic Boston Common, dwarfing the rally‚Äôs few dozen attendees and leading to what appeared to be an abrupt end of the event. Less than an hour after rallygoers arrived, they were escorted out of the area by police, as boisterous counter-protesters scuffled with officers.

But event organisers, speakers, and participants say coverage of the event has been mischaracterised and that it accomplished its purpose to talk about the importance of free speech. ‚ÄúWe were there to discuss the spectrum of American views,‚Äù said Dr Shiva Ayyadurai, who gave the keynote at the rally. Ayyadurai, a Cambridge technology entrepreneur who is seeking the GOP nomination to challenge Democratic US Sen. Elizabeth Warren, added that the crowd was a politically and racially diverse group of mostly students.

In the days leading up to Saturday‚Äôs long-planned event, organisers publicly distanced themselves from the Aug. 12 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left a woman dead and many more injured. Addressing concerns that a similar event might come to Boston, Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh had denounced ‚Äúhate groups‚Äù that would potentially attend Saturday‚Äôs gathering.

But when asked about the atmosphere at the Parkman Bandstand on the Common where supporters gathered Saturday, participants described the opposite of what opponents had feared.

‚ÄúI was holding one of the ‚ÄòBlack Lives Do Matter‚Äô signs,‚Äù said attendee April Sutherland, 25, of Seattle. Photos show the signs being held up as Ayyadurai is speaking. ‚ÄúIt was powerful to have our voices heard. The police were very good at escorting us out (and) we were met with people who were so encouraging. Forty thousand people were objecting to something they didn‚Äôt realise was a lie.‚Äù Melissa Smith, 32, of Brookline, said she participated in the rally because free speech is important to her. ‚Äú(The event) was very successful,‚Äù she said.

Despite multiple confrontations, fights breaking out and objects getting thrown at police, authorities touted the events as mostly peaceful, reporting a total of 33 arrests for disorderly conduct, assaulting a police officer and other offenses. Those arrested are expected in court this week. Officials say about 40,000 people attended.

The counter-demonstration received praise from Walsh, who said Boston ‚Äústood for peace and love‚Äù and President Donald Trump, who said the people in Boston were ‚Äúspeaking out‚Äù against bigotry and hate. Trump added in a Twitter message that ‚ÄúOur country will soon come together as one!‚Äù

Centralised appointment for lower judiciary: Supreme Court defers hearing,"Supreme Court. (File/Photo) Supreme Court. (File/Photo)

The Jammu and Kashmir government on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that the proposal for Centralised Selection Mechanism for appointments in the subordinate judiciary needed interpretation of Constitution as the state enjoyed a special relationship with the Centre. Seeking to refer the matter to a larger bench, the state government told a bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar, Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel and A M Khanwilkar that appointment of district judges was a constitutional power of the Governor in consultation with the high court. Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi and advocate Shoeb Alam, appearing for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, told the bench that this constitutional power cannot be taken away by the exercise of judicial power by apex court.

Dwivedi said that there were various constitution bench judgements interpreting the Constitution and hence the matter should be heard by a larger bench.

‚ÄúAppointment of district judges is a constitutional power vested with the Governor to be exercised in consultation with the high court. Thus this power cannot be taken away or abridge by exercise of judical powers by court,‚Äù he said.

He said that Jammu and Kashmir enjoyed a special relationship with the Union of India and under Rule 9 of Higher Judicaal Services Rules, 2009, only a permanent resident of the state is eligible for appointment as a district judge.

Dwivedi further contended that the concept of a common syllabus will be anomalous, since the laws of the state are different from rest of the country.

The apex court deferred the hearing on the issue for two weeks after hearing the contentions of Chhattisgarh High Court, the Delhi High Court, the central government and amicus curiae Arvind Datar.

Senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, appearing for Delhi High Court, told the top court that a full court meeting of high court was convened on August 21.

He said that the members of Central Selection Committee (CSC) should be from among the sitting judges of all the High Courts and selection based on multiple choice questions will not be a meaningful assessment as it would dilute merit.

However, Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the Centre, refuted the contentions that the proposal violated Article 233 of Constitution.

The matter will now be heard by a new bench as Chief Justice Khehar will retire on August 27.

Earlier, Madhya Pradesh had supported the Central Selection Mechanism proposed by the top court for appoinment in subordinate judiciary, saying the process will assist the High Courts.

The apex court‚Äôs proposal last week met with stiff opposition from West Bengal and the Calcutta High Court which claimed that the move was unconstitutional and would breach the federal structure.

The apex court had taken the proposal on its judicial side to arrive at a consensus over the mechanism for appointment in subordinate judiciary, terming it as a ‚Äúservice to nation‚Äù on the grounds that the delay in recruitment had led to a huge backlog of cases.

The apex court had on August 4 indicated that it was inclined to go ahead with a proposal for a centralised selection mechanism for appointment of judicial officers in the subordinate judiciary even if there was no amicable consensus among various the high courts and the states.

It had said that if the need arose it might accord a day-long hearing on the issue on August 22 to resolve the objections of various states and high courts to the proposal.

The court had tried to assuage the concern of various states and high court, saying there would be no breach and interference in the federal structure and it is ‚Äútrying to do some service to the nation‚Äù.

"Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia eye medal at World Wrestling Championships","Sakshi Malik will spearhead India‚Äôs campaign in the World Wrestling Championship in Paris. (File) Sakshi Malik will spearhead India‚Äôs campaign in the World Wrestling Championship in Paris. (File)

With their eyes firmly trained on winning medals, Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik and Asian champion Bajrang Punia will spearhead the Indian challenge at the World Wrestling Championships, starting on Monday. All eyes would be on Rio Games bronze-winner in 58kg, Sakshi, who bagged a silver medal at the Asian Championship in May after climbing up a division to 60kg category.

Having qualified in the same category for this championships, Sakshi would be hoping to do one better when she takes on the mat on Thursday in the women‚Äôs wrestling competition. Vinesh Phogat, another silver medallist at the Asian Championship, will also fancy her chances in women‚Äôs 48kg.

Although Vinesh had won the Asian Championship silver in 55kg after making a comeback from an injury she had suffered during the Rio Games, the 22-year-old is back in her preferred 48kg category. Besides Vinesh, none of the other Phogat sisters are part of the World Championship as two of the most famous ‚Äî Geeta and Babita ‚Äî didn‚Äôt even participate in the trials, while the younger ones ‚Äî Ritu and Sangeeta ‚Äî failed to qualify.

Meanwhile, in men‚Äôs freestyle, bronze medallist of the 2013 Budapest edition, Bajrang would be eyeing a gold this time around with his confidence high after finishing on top of the podium at the Asian Championship.

Bajrang, who had bagged a bronze at Budapest in 60kg freestyle, has now climbed up a division to 65kg. However, he looked pretty comfortable in his new weight division as he fought Asia‚Äôs best wrestlers in this category a few months ago to emerge victorious. Although he ensured a berth at the World Championship just about 10 days ago, Bajrang proved far superior when he thrashed Rahul Mann 10-0 at a special selection trial held here on August 12.

Earlier, Mann had emerged the winner in 65kg during the selection trials held in Sonepat last month, but Bajrang submitted an application to the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), communicating his inability to take part in the trials due to viral fever and requesting that the final trials in his weight category be held after his recovery. However, when Bajrang recovered, Mann suffered a minor neck injury and the trial could not be held. Subsequently, on the request of the chief coach Jagminder Singh, both the wrestlers travelled to France and the final trial took place before the tournament.

Besides Bajrang, India will pin hopes on Olympian Sandeep Tomar in 57kg as he has performed consistently in the last couple of years. A medal at the World Championship is something that Sandeep would want to see against his name.

Among other freestyle wrestlers, Amit Dhankar (70kg), Praveen Rana (74kg) and Satywart Kadiyan (97kg), who will be conferred with the Arjuna Award after this championships, are also expected to bring in laurels for the country.

The Greco-Roman contest will take place on the first two days of the competition and India will be fielding an eight-member team. Although Greco-Roman has not been India‚Äôs strong point, the country would be hoping for a couple of them to spring a surprise or two.

Squad: Men‚Äôs Freestyle: Sandeep Tomar (57kg), Harphool (61kg), Bajrang Punia (65kg), Amit Dhankar (70kg), Praveen Rana (74kg), Deepak (86kg), Satywart Kadiyan (97kg), Sumit (125kg).

Women‚Äôs wrestling: Vinesh Phogat (48kg), Sheetal (53kg), Lalita (55kg), Pooja Dhanda (58kg), Sakshi Malik (60kg), Shilpi (63kg), Navjot Kaur (69kg), Pooja (75kg).

Greco-Roman: Gyanender (59kg), Ravinder (66kg), Yogesh (71kg), Gurpreet Singh (75kg), Harpreet Singh (80kg), Ravinder Khatri (85kg), Hardeep (98kg), Naveen (130kg).

Myanmar man faces jail for speaking about child soldier past,"Police in Dagon Seikkan Township where the arrest was made did not respond to requests for comment. (Representational Image) Police in Dagon Seikkan Township where the arrest was made did not respond to requests for comment. (Representational Image)

A man in Myanmar faces up to two years in jail after he was arrested for allegedly defaming the military in an interview he gave detailing his harrowing life as a child soldier.

Aung Ko Htwe, 26, was arrested on Friday, shortly after he spoke to Radio Free Asia‚Äôs Burmese Service recalling how he was abducted and forced into the military as a teenager, his sister Nay Zar Htun, confirmed today. ‚ÄúThe police arrested him for 505(b),‚Äù she told AFP, referring to a section of Myanmar‚Äôs criminal code covering defamation of the military, which carries up to two years in jail.

Myanmar‚Äôs military gave up full control of the country in 2011 after decades of brutal, isolationist junta rule that crippled the country. The central army and the myriad of ethnic rebel armies it is fighting had a long track record of using child soldiers, a scourge that saw tens of thousands of minors abducted and forced into military service over decades. The country is now a quasi-democracy headed by the civilian-led government of Aung San Suu Ki. But the army retains significant political power and is sensitive to any criticism.

Nay Zar Htun said her brother was kidnapped by the military in 2005 when he was 14 years old. ‚ÄúHe felt bad about the time when he spent in the military,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo he always wanted to tell his story to people and parents to make sure children didn‚Äôt end up like him.‚Äù

She added he was currently being held at Yangon‚Äôs notorious Insein prison with the first court date scheduled for 1 September. Police in Dagon Seikkan Township where the arrest was made did not respond to requests for comment.

There are no concrete figures on how many children are still among the estimated 500,000 troops that serve in Myanmar‚Äôs military or the ethnic rebel armies it battles in the country‚Äôs border regions. The state‚Äôs army has released almost 850 children and young people from its ranks since signing a pact with the United Nations in 2012.

But experts say children remain at risk as new underage recruits continue to trickle into the military and ethnic armed groups waging insurgencies against the state.

US navy pauses operations after 10 sailors lost in collision,"The Guided-missile destroyer USS John S.

McCain (DDG 56) is moored pier side at Changi naval base in Singapore following a collision with the merchant vessel Alnic MC Monday, Aug. 21, 2017. (Grady T. Fontana/U.S. Navy photo via AP)

The US Navy declared a worldwide pause in its operations after the latest in a series of accidents left ten sailors missing and five injured. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson ordered an ‚Äúoperational pause‚Äù to allow a ‚Äúcomprehensive review‚Äù of practices after the destroyer USS John McCain was hit by a merchant tanker off Singapore.

‚ÄúAs you know this is the second collision in three months and the last of a series of incidents in the Pacific theater,‚Äù Richardson said.

‚ÄúThis trend demands more forceful action. As such I have directed an operational pause be taken in all of our fleets around the world.‚Äù

US Defense Secretary James Mattis, on a visit to Jordan, said Richardson‚Äôs ‚Äúbroader enquiry will look at all related accidents, incidents at sea, that sort of thing. He is going to look at all factors, not just the immediate one.‚Äù

There was no official word on how long the disruption to the world‚Äôs most powerful navy, active in all of the world‚Äôs oceans, might last. But some US media suggested the pause would last for a day.

Ten US sailors were still missing after the John McCain collided with a tanker today, tearing a large hole in its hull in the second accident involving an American warship in two months.

The badly damaged destroyer limped into port in the city-state of Singapore in the afternoon under escort after the dramatic pre-dawn accident, which sent water flooding into the vessel.

A major search involving ships and aircraft from three countries was launched for the missing sailors after the McCain hit the Alnic MC in the busy shipping lanes of the Singapore Strait, near the Strait of Malacca.

Analysts said the accident, so soon after June‚Äôs collision off Japan involving a US warship, raised questions about whether the US Navy was overstretched in Asia as it seeks to combat Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea and North Korea‚Äôs nuclear ambitions.

The US Navy said there was ‚Äúsignificant damage to the hull‚Äù of the warship in the latest collision, which led to flooding of crew sleeping areas, machinery and communications rooms.

‚ÄúDamage control efforts by the crew halted further flooding,‚Äù they said in a statement after the John S. McCain arrived at Changi Naval Base in the city-state.

A helicopter took four of the injured to a Singapore hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening while the fifth did not need further medical attention, the navy said.

The 505-foot (154-meter) vessel could still sail under its own power after the collision at 5:24 am (2124 GMT Sunday) with the Liberian-flagged tanker, which was slightly bigger at 600 feet. Two other vessels escorted it into port, AFP journalists saw.

The warship had been heading for a routine stop in Singapore after carrying out a ‚Äúfreedom of navigation operation‚Äù in the disputed South China Sea earlier in August around a reef in the Spratly Islands, sparking a furious response from Beijing.

The vessel is named after US Senator John McCain‚Äôs father and grandfather, who were both admirals in the US navy.

McCain himself, who as a naval pilot was shot down during the Vietnam War and held prisoner, welcomed the review.

‚ÄúI agree with Admiral Richardson that more forceful action is urgently needed to identify and correct the causes of the recent ship collisions,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI expect full transparency and accountability from the Navy leaders as they conduct the associated investigations and reviews.‚Äù

President Donald Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThoughts & prayers are w/ our @USNavy sailors aboard the #USSJohnMcCain where search & rescue efforts are underway.‚Äù

Ridzwan Rahmat, a naval expert at Janes by IHS Markit, said initial indications suggested the US warship may not have been obeying rules designed to separate maritime traffic passing through the Singapore Strait.

With the accident coming soon after the freedom of navigation operation, he told AFP that it raised questions ‚Äúwhether there is crew fatigue setting in, whether or not the tempo of operations by the US Navy in this region is getting too fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre they doing too much within this region with North Korea, and Japan and then now in the South China Sea?‚Äù

Singapore, Malaysia and US ships and aircraft were all involved in the hunt for the missing sailors.

The tanker involved in the collision, which was used for transporting oil and chemicals and weighed over 30,000 gross tonnes, sustained some damage but no crew were injured, and Singapore said there was no oil pollution.

In June, seven American sailors died when the destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-flagged cargo ship in a busy channel not far from Yokosuka, a gateway to container ports in Tokyo and nearby Yokohama.

The dead sailors, aged 19 to 37, were found by divers in flooded sleeping berths a day after the collision tore a huge gash in the side of the Fitzgerald.

A senior admiral announced last week that the commander of the destroyer and several other officers had been relieved of their duties aboard their ship over the incident.

Both the USS John S. McCain and USS Fitzgerald are part of the US Seventh Fleet based in Yokosuka.

Bangladesh sentences 10 to death for 2000 plot to kill PM Sheikh Hasina,"Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina (File photo) Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina (File photo)

A Bangladesh court has sentenced to death 10 leaders and activists from a banned Islamist group for a plot in 2000 to kill Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by planting bombs at one of her rallies. Judge Mamtaz Begum sentenced the suspects on Sunday in Dhaka, the capital, and ordered them to be shot to death, which is unusual in Bangladesh, where most executions take place by hanging. Prosecutors said two bombs were found a day before Hasina was scheduled to address a rally at a college campus in the southern town of Kotalipara.

Those convicted belong to the Harkatul Jihad-al-Islami group. Defense attorneys said they would appeal the verdict. The group‚Äôs former chief, Mufti Abdul Hannan, was involved in the plot along with his associates, prosecutors told the court. Hannan was hanged in April for his involvement in a 2004 grenade attack on a British envoy in Bangladesh. The court acquitted 10 of the suspects for lack of evidence, said prosecutor Khondaker Abdul Mannan. Harkatul Jihad-al-Islami has been blamed for many attacks in Bangladesh in recent years. Though weakened, the group is struggling to fight the government‚Äôs nationwide crackdown against hard-liners who want to establish strict Islamic law in the Muslim-majority country.

Hannan studied in India and Pakistan, and fought against Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan in the 1980s before returning to Bangladesh. Bangladesh has experienced a rise of Islamic militancy in recent years. Scores of attacks have taken place against members of minority groups, foreigners and atheist bloggers. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for many of the attacks, but Prime Minister Hasina‚Äôs government has rejected the claims. Authorities say the IS doesn‚Äôt exist in Bangladesh and blame the attacks on a domestic group, Jumatul Mujahedin Bangladesh. Hasina, who is in her second stint as Bangladesh‚Äôs leader, was also prime minister from 1996 to 2001.

Pakistan and Afghanistan on Saturday recognised terrorism as their ‚Äúcommon enemy‚Äù as the two countries agreed to deepen cooperation to eliminate the ‚Äúmenace‚Äù, an official statement said. Pakistan Foreign Office said the visiting Afghan Deputy Foreign Minister Nasir Andesha called on Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua and the two discussed ways to strengthen bilateral ties in diverse fields as well as improving efforts for lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan.

‚ÄúRecognising that terrorism was a common enemy of the two countries and its peoples, Foreign Secretary and the Afghan Deputy Foreign Minister agreed for deepening cooperation and coordinating in counter-terrorism efforts with a view to eliminate this menace,‚Äù Foreign office said in a statement. Janjua underlined the need for enhancing economic cooperation, trade, transit and connectivity for the mutual benefit of the people of both the countries.

She emphasised on the need to expedite infrastructure and energy connectivity projects between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Andesha is visiting Pakistan to mark Afghanistan‚Äôs Independence Day celebrations and for the foundation-laying ceremony of the new Afghan Embassy in the Diplomatic Enclave in Islamabad.

Earlier, Janjua visited Kabul on August 15 for meetings with Afghan leadership to strengthen bilateral relations. Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan had strained due to cross border terrorism attacks which led to months of tensions and war of words between the two countries.

Pakistan had closed down its borders with Afghanistan at Chaman and Torkham in February following terrorist attacks blamed on militants who have taken sanctuary across the border. The border points were opened after a month on the orders of the prime minister after millions of dollars were lost in trading and business between the two countries.

Donald Trump: India‚Äôs role critical in Afghanistan‚Äôs stability; Pakistan must stop sheltering terrorists,"U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer. (Source: Reuters) U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer. (Source: Reuters)

After months of speculation and delays over his plans about Afghanistan, US President Donald Trump finally unveiled his strategy to win a war which has stretched over 16 years. Targetting Pakistan for its safe harbour to terrorism over the years, Trump said that America needs to change its approach in dealing with Pakistan, ‚ÄúWe cannot be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe heaven for terror groups.‚Äù He was addressing Army troops at Fort Myer.

Identifying Pakistan as a refuge state to terrorism the President said, ‚ÄúPakistan often gives safe havens to agents of chaos, violence and terror.‚Äù Trump went on to add that more than 20 US designated terror organisation are active in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the highest concentration in any region anywhere in the world.

Taking a strong stance against Pakistan, Trump said, ‚ÄúPakistan has much to gain from our efforts in Afghanistan and it has much to loose by continuing to harbour criminals and terrorists. It has sheltered the same organisations that try every single day to kill our people.‚Äù Stressing that things will have to change Trump said that America has been paying Pakistan billions of dollars while at the same time they are housing terror organisation that America is fighting, ‚Äúbut that will have to change immediately.‚Äù

Recognising India‚Äôs critical role in furthering peace and security in the south Asia region, Trump appreciated India‚Äôs contribution to stability in Afghanistan saying, ‚ÄúWe want India to help us more with Afghanistan in the area of economic assistance and development and in the broader indo-pacific region.‚Äù

Talking about the simmering tensions between India and Pakistan, Trump said, ‚ÄúThe threat is worse because Pakistan and India are two nuclear-armed states whose tense relations threaten to spiral into conflict, and that could happen.‚Äù Trump unveiled his approach towards Afghanistan by vowing to continue the fight to avoid any ‚Äúpredictable and unacceptable‚Äù results of a rapid and sudden withdrawal of troops from the country.

Calling himself a ‚Äúproblem solver‚Äù, Trump said that he inherited a ‚Äúbad and very complex hand.‚Äù Acting completely opposite to his views as expressed during the presidential campaign of pulling out from Afghanistan which was an unsolvable quagmire, Trump said that the decision to pull off might create a vacuum that terrorist organisations like Al-Qaeda and ISIS could instant fill just as happened before September 11. Attacking former president Barack Obama for pulling out ‚Äúhastily‚Äù from Iraq, Trump said that due to those policies Iraq ‚Äúslipped back into the hands of terrorists, enemies, and we cannot repeat in Afghanistan our leaders made in Iraq.‚Äù He added, Working alongside our allies we will break their will, dry up their recruitment, keep them from crossing our border, yes we will defeat them.‚Äù

Expressing that American interest in Afghanistan and Pakistan are clear, Trump said, ‚ÄúWe must stop the resurgence of safe heavens that enable terrorist to threat America, and we must prevent Nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us or anywhere in the world.‚Äù

Saying that the American support to Afghanistan is not a ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù Trump said that the strategy in Afghanistan will now shift from time based approach to one based on conditions. Without revealing the number of troops to remain stationed in Afghanistan or figures of new deployment in the mountainous country, Trump said, ‚ÄúWe will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities, conditions on ground not arbitrary time table will guide our strategy.‚Äù

Expressing that it is up to the people of Afghanistan to take ownership of their future trump said We are partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live or govern their own complex society.‚Äù

Chepauk Super Gillies dominate TUTI Patriots to win TNPL 2017,"Washington Sunder was awarded the man-of-tournament award. Washington Sunder was awarded the man-of-tournament award.

Throughout the Tamil Nadu Premier League season this year, TUTI Patriots dominated their opponents and reached the final without losing a single match. They continued to better their performance with each and were the favourites in the final against Chepauk Super Gilles. But, as fate would have it, the unbeaten team of TNPL 2017 lost the final against Chepauk and finished second in the tournament which looked theirs. CSG chased down the final target of 144 runs in 19 overs with six wickets in hand to be crowned as the winners of the second edition of TNPL.

Patriots captain Dinesh Karthik won the toss and elected to bat in Chennai hoping that his batsmen will put up a competitive total as they had in league phase. The strong batting line-up of Patriots had to face some top class bowling from CSG. The bowlers ‚Äî especially the spinners ‚Äî set up the match with some tight line and length.

Washington Sundar, who had impressed everyone with both bat and ball in the league, was once again looking good for Patriots but he failed to judge a slower ball from R Sathish and was caught at mid-on. A small rain break took the momentum away from Patriots and they slipped to 52 for the loss of two wickets after seven overs with Kaushik Gandhi falling for 24.

Abhinav Mukund, who joined the team after playing the Test series for India against Sri Lanka, played a handy knock of 41 runs but took 38 balls. But, after his wicket in the 14th over and at the score of 95, Patriots failed to capitalise in the final overs and made only 143 runs.

The chase for CSG was not an easy one as their openers began on a cautious note. Gopinath and Thalaivan Sargunam took their time in the powerplay and had added only 46 runs from eight overs. The latter fell in the ninth over for 16 runs.

Like Patriots, CSG were also slow and were 93 for the loss of four wickets in the 16th over with Gopinath falling after his half-century. But, captain Sathish and Sathiamoorty Saravanan managed to not lose their wickets and with CSG needing 22 off the last 12 balls, launched an assault.

Saravanan was on strike with his team needing 15 off the final nine balls. Sundar was bowling the penultimate over and Saravanan hit the fourth ball of his over for a six. He followed it with another six before sealing the match and the title for his team with a four. He was also declared the man-of-the-match for his 10-ball 23.

17-year-old Sundar was declared the man-of-the-tournament as he was the highest run scorer and second highest wicket-taker in the tournament.

UK to treat online hate crimes as seriously as offline abuse,"A hate crime is defined as an offence where the perpetrator is motivated by hostility or shows hostility towards the victim‚Äôs disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity. (Representational image) A hate crime is defined as an offence where the perpetrator is motivated by hostility or shows hostility towards the victim‚Äôs disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity. (Representational image)

The UK on Monday issued a new legal guidance saying online hate crimes should be treated as seriously as those committed in person, in the wake of a record country-wide spike in such offences which authorities said had a ‚Äúcorrosive effect‚Äù on the society. The new guidance from Crown Prosecution Service (CPS )is marking the publication of the documents with the launch of a social media campaign ‚Äì #HateCrimeMatters ‚Äì to encourage people to come forward and report hate crime incidents.

‚ÄúIn recognition of the growth of hate crime perpetrated using social media, a commitment to treat online crime as seriously as offline offences, while taking into account the potential impact on the wider community as well as the victim,‚Äù reads the new guidance.

‚ÄúHate crime has a corrosive effect on our society and that is why it is a priority area for the CPS. It can affect entire communities, forcing people to change their way of life and live in fear,‚Äù said Alison Saunders, UK‚Äôs Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).

Saunders said these documents took account of the current breadth and context of offending to provide prosecutors with the best possible chance of achieving justice for victims. ‚ÄúThey also let victims and witnesses know what they should expect from us. I hope that, along with this week‚Äôs campaign, they will give people the confidence to come forward and report hate crime, in the knowledge that they will be

taken seriously and given the support they need,‚Äù she said.

A hate crime is defined as an offence where the perpetrator is motivated by hostility or shows hostility towards the victim‚Äôs disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity. In 2015-16, the CPS completed 15,442 hate crime prosecutions, the highest number ever as police forces have recorded a UK-wide spike in such crimes.

The conviction rate across all strands of hate crime increased from 82.9 per cent in 2014-15 to 83.2 per cent in 2015-16, the CPS said. ‚ÄúWhether shouted in their face on the street, daubed on their wall or tweeted into their living room, the impact of hateful abuse on a victim can be equally devastating,‚Äù Saunders said.

Until now, CPS guidance on hate crime motivated by sexual orientation has had a general focus on all victims. The new guidance specifically refers to bisexual victims, particularly if they report being victimised by gay men or lesbians.

The CPS consulted community groups and criminal justice representatives to produce revised statements covering the different strands of hate crime: racist and religious; disability and homophobic, biphobic and transphobic. The revised legal guidance sets out how prosecutors in the UK should make charging decisions and handle such cases in court.

"Deepika Padukone, Katrina Kaif or Patralekha ‚Äî Who aced colour blocking better?","Colour blocking with pink and red is very difficult to pull off, but Patralekha has given it a new spin with a tangerine hue. (Source: Patralekhaa/Instagram, File Photo, File Photo) Colour blocking with pink and red is very difficult to pull off, but Patralekha has given it a new spin with a tangerine hue. (Source: Patralekhaa/Instagram, File Photo, File Photo)

Recently, Bollywood beauty Deepika Padukone made a colour-blocking statement when she wore a red velvet oriental print dress with hot pink wide-legged pants from Zara. The look failed to impress because the red and pink colour blocking technique, which is really hard to pull off, didn‚Äôt work out for this beauty. The separates are beautiful on their own but teamed together, they look jarring. But Patralekha Mishra Paul, the ‚ÄòCitylights‚Äô actor who chose to go for a similar look managed to pull it off beautifully.

Unlike Padukone, Paul chose to colour block her hot pink high-neck top from Zara with a flared tangerine skirt from Forever New. Styled by Devki B, she chose to play down the colour game with a pair of nude heels, a soft pink pout and a top-knot hair bun with cute bangs.

Colour-blocking has been a celebrity favourite for a while now. Katrina Kaif too, was seen in a pink-and-red dress by Jill Jill Stuart during a press meet while promoting Fitoor in 2016. She chose the same colours like Padukone, and failed to create an impact. While this is closer home, international stars like Taylor Swift and Beyonc√© have also flaunted the colour blocking fashion technique with elan. Among them, it is Taylor Swift‚Äôs popular number that will remain our favourite.

US defense secretary in Iraq as troops battle for Tal Afar,"US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (REUTERS/Toru Hanai) US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (REUTERS/Toru Hanai)

US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Iraq on Tuesday just days after the start of an offensive to oust Islamic State from the city of Tal Afar, with talks focused on backing Iraqi efforts to stabilise areas recaptured from the militant group. Prior to arriving, Mattis said the fight against Islamic State was far from over despite recent successes by Western-backed Iraqi government forces.

The battle for Tal Afar would be difficult, US officials said. Iraqi security forces opened the offensive to take back Tal Afar on Sunday, their latest objective in the war following the recapture of Mosul after a nine-month campaign that left much of the city in ruins. Lying 80 km (50 miles) west of Mosul in Iraq‚Äôs far north, Tal Afar is a long-time stronghold of the hardline Sunni Muslim insurgents,

‚ÄúISIS‚Äô days are certainly numbered, but it is not over yet and it is not going to be over anytime soon,‚Äù Mattis told reporters in Amman. Mattis said that after retaking Tal Afar, Iraqi forces would move against the western Euphrates River valley. Brigadier General Andrew Croft, responsible for coalition air operations over Iraq, said that between 10,000 and 20,000 civilians remained in Tal Afar. The plight of civilians was a big factor in the battle of Mosul as Islamic State tried to keep them areas it controlled to act as human shields against air strikes and artillery bombardments. Several thousand are believed to have been killed.

Croft said that over the past two or three months, he had seen a fracturing in Islamic State leadership. ‚ÄúIt just seems less coordinated. It appears more fractured, less robust, and sort of flimsy, is the word I would use‚Ä¶it is sporadic,‚Äù Croft told reporters. Islamic State leaders fled Mosul during the fighting there and the whereabouts of its chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are unknown. Unconfirmed reports in the past few months have said he is dead.

Brett McGurk, US special envoy to the coalition, said that while the battle for Tal Afar would be difficult, Iraqi forces had retaken 235 square km (90 miles) in the first 24 hours. US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mattis, who will meet Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Defence Minister Arfan al-Hayali, will discuss the future of US forces in Iraq after the recapture of the remaining cities under Islamic State, and the role they could play in stabilizing operations.

The officials said that while big cities like Mosul have been largely been cleared of Islamic State militants, there were concerns about the ability of Iraqi forces to hold territory. Mattis said pockets of resistance remained in west Mosul, including sleeper cells. Iraqi security forces were capable of carrying out simultaneous operations, he added.

Islamic State is also on the back foot in Syria, where Kurdish and Arab militias backed by the US-led coalition have captured swathes of its territory in the north and are assaulting its main Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. McGurk said about 2,000 Islamic State fighters remained in Raqqa and as much as 60 percent of the city had been retaken. The jihadist group is now falling back deeper into the Euphrates valley region of eastern Syria.

Mattis said the next step for forces fighting Islamic State in Syria would be a move against the middle Euphrates valley, a reference to the militants‚Äô stronghold in Deir al-Zor province southeast of Raqqa.

KURDISH REFERENDUM

A US official also said Mattis would press Massoud Barzani, president of the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government, to call off a planned referendum on independence. Iraq‚Äôs Kurds have said they will hold the referendum on Sept. 25 despite concerns from Iraq‚Äôs neighbors who have Kurdish minorities within their borders and a US request to postpone it. However, a senior Kurdish official said the Kurds may consider the possibility of a postponment in return for financial and political concessions from the central government in Baghdad.

McGurk said the Kurdish delegation‚Äôs recent visit to Baghdad was encouraging. The Pentagon signed an agreement with Peshmerga forces last year to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and equipment. The US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the memorandum of understanding would expire soon and suggested that Mattis could use it as a bargaining chip.

The United States and other Western nations fear the vote could ignite a new conflict with Baghdad and possibly neighboring countries, diverting attention from the ongoing war against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

NIOS: Aadhaar to be mandatory for open school examination,"Aadhaar card Aadhaar card

After making Aadhaar card mandatory in JEE, NEET and UGC NET examination, the government has not made it compulsory for students appearing for open school exams to ensure there are no proxy candidates appearing on others‚Äô behalf.

Following approval from the HRD Ministry, the National Institute of Open Learning (NIOS) has decided to make Aadhaar mandatory for candidates appearing for the next examination, a senior NIOS official said. ‚ÄúDuring the exams held in March, the inspection teams had found proxy candidates who were appearing on other students‚Äô behalf. To check this practice, Aadhaar has been made mandatory.

‚ÄúThere will also be scanner machines at examination centres and only those students whose thumb prints match with the existing data be allowed to give exams,‚Äù the official said.

NIOS, which was set up in 1989, is providing a number of vocational, life enrichment and community oriented courses besides general and academic courses at secondary and senior secondary level.

It also offers elementary level courses through its Open Basic Education Programmes (OBE). The NIOS has also decided that those schools where CCTV facility is not available will not be made examination centres. ‚ÄúThis has been decided to ensure that videography of the entire examination process is possible and the footage can be checked in future if need be,‚Äù the official added.

"Little doubt that Umar Akmal is alleging Micky Arthur of abusing out of frustration, says Aamer Sohail","Umar Akmal had accused Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur of abusing him. Umar Akmal had accused Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur of abusing him.

Pakistan isn‚Äôt new to controversy in cricket and former Test opener Aamer Sohail believes that the allegations made by batsman Umar Akmal against coach Micky Arthur is the latest to hit them. He said that there is lot of promise shown by Akmal in his career but whatever he is doing now is out of frustration.

‚ÄúIt appears that there is a new controversy brewing in Pakistan cricket with Umar Akmal‚Äôs allegations of abusive language used by Pakistan Head Coach Mickey Arthur. In my view, there is little doubt in the fact that Umar Akmal is doing this out of frustration at the manner in which his career is progressing so far.

‚ÄúThere was a lot of promise in his career at the onset but that has failed to materialize and not been fulfilled,‚Äù Pakpassion.net quoted Sohail as saying.

Akmal had alleged that the Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur had abused him and dropped him from Champions Trophy squad. He was also not allowed to take the fitness Test at the NCA.

But, Sohail also said that Pakistan Cricket Board have failed to provide any support to the batsmen who could have been mentored.

‚ÄúThe PCB on their part have also been lax in the way they have failed to provide support to the batsman. If he had any drawbacks or faults in his skills or personality, then they should have mentored him in a proper way.

‚ÄúIf you compare Pakistan to other countries in the world, talented players are given attention and work done with them not only on cricketing aspects but also on matters related to off the field as well,‚Äù he said.

PCB backed Arthur and blasted Akmal for false accusations against the coach. In a statement released on Friday, PCB said that Akmal was attempting to deviate attention away from his own failures.

‚ÄúWhile making frivolous allegations against the national team management, Umar has made a bogus attempt to deviate attention from his own failings. Umar was given as many as seven chances to improve his fitness and match the standards of his teammates, laid out by the team management.‚Äù

The 50-year-old said that Akmal‚Äôs chances of making a comeback under Arthur have gone down after the latest outburst.

‚ÄúI also believe that Umar Akmal‚Äôs chances of making a comeback into this team under the current Head Coach have been greatly diminished by his outburst as now there may be an element of personal like or dislike in selection matters. His international career will now go on hold but really what he should have done is to work hard on all aspects of his cricket which were identified as weak by others and followed that route to come back into the team,‚Äù he added.

VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: This Dhanush-Kajol film suffers due to a hopelessly stilted plot,"VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: Kajol is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings. VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: Kajol is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings.

VIP 2 Lalkar movie cast: Dhanush, Kajol, Amala Paul

VIP 2 Lalkar movie director: Soundarya Rajinikanth

VIP 2 Lalkar movie star rating: 1.5

The only reason to keep watching this film right till the bitter end comes right at the end. This is not a spoiler. It‚Äôs just a tip, which comes to you via gritted teeth, because you keep asking yourself in disbelief, just how bad can a Dhanush film get?

Going by VIP 2, let me tell you, it can get pretty terrible.

VIP 2 Lalkar is 99 percent tosh, created for the express purpose of getting Dhanush to sing and dance and ‚Äòdo comedy‚Äô and fight, all the things a Hero is meant to do.

Given that the leading man is capable of terrific acting, and has done all kinds of interesting, edgy roles, this one should have been a snip. But he flubs it, essentially because of a hopelessly stilted plot and treatment that is all clich√©.

Taking off from where the original VIP left off, we see Raghuvaran (Dhanush) crossing swords with the very toffee-nosed Vasundhara (Kajol), the former being the very proletarian, down-to-earth engineer and the savior of many working class young joes like himself, the latter being the very wealthy, arrogant owner of the biggest architect firm in the region.

‚ÄòVellai‚Äô (work) plus ‚Äòillai‚Äô (no) adds up to Jobless Raghuvaran, whose fight against Vasundhara is on the principles of fairness and justice and truth and saving the environment. That must have sounded good on paper, but is executed so ham-handedly, that you cringe.

And Kajol, who was so good in her big Tamil outing many years ago (Rajeev Menon‚Äôs Minsara Kanuvu aka Sapnay, ‚Äò97) is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings. She‚Äôs written with no variation, and you watch in despair: Kajol has much more in her; she certainly doesn‚Äôt need this. And we are expected to believe that Dhanush, the slender, lightweight Dhanush, can take on burly villains single-handedly, and send them flying, slo-mo.

All you can is to roll your eyes.

And one more thing. Given that there is a female director at the helm, it has surprisingly regressive lines, poking fun at wives and other women. These jokes have gone old, and more so in a film helmed by the next gen.

In the last few minutes, the film changes tack, loosens up, allowing the two leads to break out. Suddenly, we find the two talking to each other, measuring each other up for size, showing us two actors at work.

This could have been the film.

"President Ashraf Ghani welcomes Donald Trump‚Äôs news South Asia strategy , says ‚ÄòUS-Afghan partnership stronger than ever‚Äô","Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. (PTI photo) Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. (PTI photo)

President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday welcomed US President Donald Trump‚Äôs new South Asia strategy to combat terrorism in Afghanistan saying the move is an affirmation of the joint effort by his country and the US to free the region from the ‚Äùthreat of terrorism‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am grateful to President Trump and the American people for this affirmation of support for our efforts to achieve self-reliance and for our joint effort to rid the region of the threat of terrorism,‚Äù said Ghani.

He added that the US Afghan Partnership is stronger than ever and peace in the region remains the priority of the new US strategy. ‚ÄúThe US Afghan Partnership is stronger than ever ever in overcoming the threat that terrorism that threatens all of us‚Ä¶ The objective of peace is paramount. Peace remains our priority,‚Äù said Ghani.

Hailing America‚Äôs effort to combat terrorism in the region, Ghani said, ‚ÄúIt (new South Asia strategy) puts particular emphasis on enhancing Afghan air power, doubling the size of Afghan Special Forces, deepening NATO‚Äôs ability to train, advise and assist Afghan National Defence and Security forces.‚Äù

Earlier in the day, while announcing his Afghanistan and South Asia strategy, Donald Trump criticized Islamabad‚Äôs continued support for cross-border terrorism and warned Pakistan of consequences for providing safe havens to terrorists and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. ‚ÄúIn Afghanistan and Pakistan, America‚Äôs interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter,‚Äù Donald Trump had said in his speech.

Trunp also said that US approach to Pakistan would change under the new policy and India would play a larger role in establishing peace in the region. ‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond. Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists‚Ä¶We appreciate India‚Äôs important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region,‚Äù Trump said.

"Police separate some 500 neo-Nazis, opponents at Berlin demo","FILE ‚Äì In this file photo dated Saturday, Aug. 21, 2004, Neo-Nazi sympathisers demonstrate prior to the beginning of a commemoration march for Adolf Hitler‚Äôs deputy Rudolf Hess in the northeastern Bavarian town of Wunsiedel where Hess is buried. (AP Photo/FILE) FILE ‚Äì In this file photo dated Saturday, Aug. 21, 2004, Neo-Nazi sympathisers demonstrate prior to the beginning of a commemoration march for Adolf Hitler‚Äôs deputy Rudolf Hess in the northeastern Bavarian town of Wunsiedel where Hess is buried. (AP Photo/FILE)

Some 500 far-right extremists began a march in Berlin on Saturday in honor of the 30th anniversary of the death of top Nazi Rudolf Hess. About 500 counter-demonstrators gathered nearby the parade in the Spandau district, separated by hundreds of heavily armored police.

Berlin police spokesman Carsten Mueller told The Associated Press that authorities have imposed a number of restrictions on Saturday‚Äôs march to ensure it passes peacefully. Police have told organizers they can march, but they‚Äôre not allowed to glorify Hess, who died at Spandau prison. The neo-Nazis are allowed to bring banners: but only one for every 50 participants.

Such restrictions are common in Germany and rooted in the experience of the pre-war Weimar Republic, when opposing political groups would try to forcibly interrupt their rivals‚Äô rallies, resulting in frequent bloody street violence.

The exact rules differ according to the circumstances, but police in Germany say they generally try to balance protesters‚Äô rights to free speech and free assembly against the rights of counter-demonstrators and residents.

The rules mean that shields, helmets and batons carried by far-right and Neo-Nazi protesters in Charlottesville last weekend wouldn‚Äôt be allowed in Germany. Openly anti-Semitic chants would prompt German police to intervene, although efforts would be made to detain specific individuals rather than to stop an entire rally, police say.

Left-wing groups expect about 1,000 people to attend the counter-protests.

Hess, who received a life sentence at the Nuremberg trials for his role in planning World War II, died on Aug. 17, 1987. Allied authorities ruled his death a suicide, but Nazi sympathizers have long claimed that he was killed and organize annual marches in his honor.

The marches used to take place in the Bavarian town of Wunsiedel, where Hess was buried until authorities removed his remains.

Surround space: Parul Sharma‚Äôs debut solo presents her worldview through black and white photographs,"One of Parul Sharma‚Äôs photographs One of Parul Sharma‚Äôs photographs

Introducing the works that comprise her debut solo, photographer Parul Sharma notes that the collection is intended at re-examining the ‚Äúasymmetry of everydayness‚Äù. Clicked from her iPhone, the black-and-white photographs chronicle Sharma‚Äôs sojourns in the last couple of years ‚Äî Mumbai, London, Paris, Kyoto, Tokyo and Delhi ‚Äî but she prefers to keep the locations discreet. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to put anything in a box. I don‚Äôt want to hinder the perspective of a person who is trying to establish a connect with my framework based on their ideas and experiences. They should be able to interpret it the way they want, and that is art,‚Äù says the former communications professional.

The high ceilings at the imposing Bikaner House in Delhi seem befitting for the display. The 40 frames offer distant and more detailed observations, featuring spiral stairs, abstract compositions and architectural details. If in one frame an empty chair waits for its occupant, in another, the window grill forms patterns on inclined beds. Diagonal lines cut across a frame in a work, while in another, Sharma photographs a street from the hollow of a metal structure.

She shoots the arch of the well-recognised Ministry of Home Affairs building in Delhi, and offers an aerial view of a busy road in Tokyo. Concentric metal nails that fill a white backdrop appear like the cosmic dot or bindu that has inspired numerous Indian artists. It has also attracted the attention of the buyers, with three red dots pasted next to it a day after the exhibition opened.

There are other occasions when Sharma gives viewers a closer glimpse into her surroundings. She places an empty Hibiki whiskey bottle on a pile of magazines on a windowsill at her Delhi home, and plays with light at a Hauz Khas haunt. The black and white medium, she believes, helps her connect deeper with the viewers. ‚ÄúIt has a starkness, rawness, and life is largely black, white and grey,‚Äù says Sharma.

Trump Afghan strategy is as if Masood rules from his grave,"U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, U.S. (Reuters Photo) U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, U.S. (Reuters Photo)

There are six encouraging and bold pillars in the new US strategy on Afghanistan as outlined by President Donald Trump.

First, it is an acknowledgement of the fact that Pakistan has been playing a destructive and dubious role in Afghanistan by providing support and sanctuary to terrorists and agents of chaos and that a diplomatic solution must be found for this problem.

The US has never been this open and frank on Pakistan‚Äôs duplicity. As a global power, the US shouldn‚Äôt escape from its words and policies and must follow up until Islamabad and its powerful army and intelligence stop nourishing the Taliban and other terrorist groups.

Second, recognizing India as a strategic partner for security and economic development in Afghanistan is also a bold and fresh statement. The US has never in the last 40 years openly portrayed India as a partner. The partnership with India will reduce the cost and burden for the NATO-led alliance and increase the cost of interference and disruption for spoilers and masters of the proxy groups. This also tears apart the suffocating and false notion that the US has no ally in the region should it go tough with Pakistan.

Third, reiterating the centrality of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) in defense of Afghan values, and safeguarding the space for democratic & constitutional play by keeping the Taliban and other terrorists at bay with military and financial assistance of the US.

The clarity in this message brushes away and kills the notion as often propagated and promoted by apologists and cynics, that the cost of peace will be a compromise of Afghan achievements and institutions. The ANDSF will remain a constant and the Afghan political and democratic process will not be derailed by deals and decisions outside the country and by the strength of the Taliban insurgency. A grand bargain won‚Äôt mean a grand collapse and shouldn‚Äôt.

Fourth, by stating a clear division of labor between the Afghan state and its international allies, the US has made it clear for good and noble reasons that it is not here to change the fabric of Afghan society and its culture or impose alien values. There is a convergence of interest in the area of security and stability and there are areas of divergence on how Afghans want to deal with the complexity of their society.

This creates a lot of ease on how Afghans pursue their political ambitions as long as they stick to the constitutional order. It also elevates the US to a partner of all, not just the ruling faction. It asks the National Unity Government of Afghanistan to be honest, serious and sincere in its fight against corruption and the building of key institutions by looking beyond factional interest and sub-national politics.

Fifth, the new strategy, in contrast to the previous one, respects the principle of strategic hierarchy of conduct and operational silence. It gives a broad, yet secret, set of authorities to Gen. Nicholson, the commander of US troops in Afghanistan as well as his future successors the authority to make tactical judgments without constantly referring to Washington.

The restrictive caveats are apparently removed. This will enable the Resolute Support Mission (RSM) to have a justifiably freer hand in conducting its day to day activities. Simplifying the command structure and respecting the authority of the highest ranking general on the ground is a welcome move. It shows that the Trump administration has adhered to age-old precious military principles and texts to ensure victory and win.

Sixth, the commitment to stay long enough to achieve the desired outcome and prevail, and reverse the Taliban strategy by taking the time from them and giving them watches instead. A negotiated settlement has not been ruled out, however, talks under duress and at gunpoint has been ruled out.

If Washington stays focused to this part, it will send a signal to regional spoilers that there won‚Äôt be any need for a rainy day and that it would be better if they bet on a stable and successful Afghanistan instead of on non-state actors and spoilers. That there will never be an Afghanistan of the shape they desire.

As an Afghan I welcome the new strategy and commit myself to contribute to its success. After all it is in conformity with the vision of my late and slain leader Ahmad Shah Masood, who always advocated the strengthening of Afghanistan alongside political, economic and diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to find a good lasting solution for terrorism in our region and beyond. After billions of dollars spent, nearly two decades of thinking and studying, the world‚Äôs only superpower endorses his vision. I feel as if Masood rules from his grave.

"$12.9-billion sale: Rosneft deal to cut debt by over 60%, says Essar","Prashant Ruia, Director, Essar Capital (left) and Suresh Jain, CFO, Essar Oil in Mumbai on Monday. Express Photo by Nirmal Harindran Prashant Ruia, Director, Essar Capital (left) and Suresh Jain, CFO, Essar Oil in Mumbai on Monday. Express Photo by Nirmal Harindran

Essar Oil, which announced the completion of sale of its India assets to the Russian government controlled Rosneft-led consortium for $12.9 billion on Monday, said it will pay back as much as Rs 70,000 crore to lenders, bringing down the group‚Äôs debt by over 60 per cent.

Giving details of the debt to be repaid using the proceeds, an Essar group official said that Essar Energy has used Rs 32,000 crore to repay debt at the holding company level. Another Rs 4,000 crore has been used to repay Indian lenders at the operating company level. In addition, Rs 34,000 crore in debt has become non-Essar exposure as it has been transferred to the new owners of Essar Oil.

Indian banks had an exposure of Rs 40,000 crore to the group before the completion of the deal. State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Standard Chartered Bank are among the lenders that have maximum exposure to Essar.

The Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal had recently approved initiating bankruptcy proceedings against group entity Essar Steel. The tribunal, while admitting two petitions filed by SBI and Standard Chartered Bank, rejected Essar Steel‚Äôs contention that insolvency proceedings should not be initiated against the company as it had already started a debt restructuring process with its creditors.

Chanda Kochhar, MD & CEO, ICICI Bank, said the deal will halve the bank‚Äôs exposure to the Essar group. ‚ÄúI am delighted to note that the entire ecosystem including the government, regulators, banks and various authorities worked together to complete the deal which is also the largest ever foreign acquisition of an Indian company. The deal also underscores the keenness of foreign investors to enter India, the fastest growing large economy in the world. This transaction reduces ICICI Bank‚Äôs exposure to the Essar Group by about 50 per cent.‚Äù

According to banking sources, the deal has come as a relief to the banks which will see part of their loans to the group repaid and the remaining debt transferred to a financially stronger entity. As part of the deal, Rosneft and a consortium of Trafigura and private investment group United Capital Partners acquired 49.13 per cent stake each in Essar Oil, Essar Group said in a statement. The remaining 1.74 per cent stake continues to be held by retail shareholders. The transaction includes sale of Essar Oil‚Äôs refinery and retail assets worth $10.9 billion together with Vadinar Port and related infrastructure assets worth $2 billion.

Prashant Ruia, Director, Essar Capital, said: ‚ÄúWith this deal, we have completed our monetisation and deleveraging programme, which is the largest undertaken by any corporate in recent years. We have substantially deleveraged our portfolio companies‚Äô balance sheets, reducing debt by over $11 billion (Rs 70,000 crore). With the completion of our capex programme, we now look forward to a period of growth in our wider portfolio of businesses.‚Äù

Rosneft CEO, Igor Sechin said, ‚ÄúTogether with our partners we intend to support the company to significantly improve its financial performance and, in the medium term, adopt an asset development strategy. The acquisition of the stake in the Vadinar refinery creates unique opportunities of synergies with existing Rosneft-owned assets and will help improve efficiency of supply to other countries within the region.‚Äù

Meanwhile, in a PTI report, Essar Oil‚Äôs new non-executive director Jonathan Kollek said that under a non-compete pact the Ruias will never be able to re-enter the oil refining and retailing sector in the country.

‚ÄúThey cannot build a refinery, they cannot build petrol stations. There is a non-compete, forever,‚Äù Kollek said, adding Rosneft will pay a royalty to Essar group for using the brand name of Essar Oil at the over 3,500 petrol pumps, which are also part of the deal.

The Ruias will, however, continue to run their refinery in Britain, wherein they have a 9 million tonne facility at Stanlow, and also their coal bed methane blocks in the country.

However, Essar Group, in a statement, has denied the longevity of the non-compete clause and said the clause is for three years only.

‚ÄúThe non-compete clause is only for a limited period of three years, after which this clause is no more applicable,‚Äù Essar spokesperson said.

Britain will not exclude possible EU oversight of UK borders after Brexit,"British Prime Minister Theresa May (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, file) British Prime Minister Theresa May (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, file)

Britain will not rule out the possibility that the European Union may retain oversight of customs controls at UK borders after it leaves the bloc, as the country seeks ways to keep unhindered access to EU markets following Brexit. Last week, the UK published a policy document proposing two possible models for British-EU customs arrangements after withdrawal from the EU in 2019.

The first model was a ‚Äúhighly streamlined customs arrangement‚Äù which involved the re-introduction of a customs border but which envisaged electronic tracking of shipments, rather than physical checks of goods and documents at the border. An alternative proposal was the ‚Äúnew customs partnership‚Äù which would remove the need for a UK-EU customs border altogether.

Under this model, the UK would operate as if it was still part of the bloc for customs purposes. British goods would be exported tariff-free and Britain would levy EU tariffs on goods coming into the UK for onward passage to the EU directly or as components in UK export goods. However, lawyers said there would be a need for a mechanism to oversee the ‚Äúnew customs partnership‚Äù to ensure that the UK was correctly monitoring goods coming into the UK and destined for Europe. The EU‚Äôs system of movement of goods across EU borders without checks works on the basis that all members closely monitor shipments coming into the bloc from outside, to ensure the correct tariffs are paid and that goods meet EU standards.

WEAKNESSES

The EU anti-fraud agency OLAF polices customs agencies across Europe to ensure they are correctly monitoring imports. OLAF has the powers to conduct on-the-spot inspections and seek information from customs bodies. If OLAF finds weaknesses in a country‚Äôs systems and that the member is not charging the appropriate duties on imports from outside the EU, it will recommend that the European Commission, the EU‚Äôs executive arm, should recover money from the offending member.

For example, in March OLAF slammed lax UK border controls and recommended the European Commission reclaim 2 billion euros the agency said was lost because Britain had failed to apply the correct EU duties on imports of Chinese clothes and footwear in recent years.

A spokesman for the UK‚Äôs tax authority said it questioned OLAF‚Äôs estimate of lost revenue. Duties collected are paid to Brussels. Commission duty recovery claims can be appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), the EU‚Äôs highest court.

UK Prime Minster Theresa May has said the UK will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of the ECJ after Britain‚Äôs exit from the bloc. However, the British finance ministry declined to say if the country would bar OLAF from policing the UK‚Äôs customs system under the ‚Äúnew customs partnership‚Äù model or whether it would allow the Commission to make demands for recovery of lost duties.

‚ÄúThe exact form of the arrangements will be agreed as part of the negotiations,‚Äù a ministry spokeswoman said.

MONEY AND EFFORT

Lode Van Den Hende, a partner with Herbert Smith Freehills in Brussels, said it was hard to see how the customs partnership model could work without OLAF or a similar body policing the UK‚Äôs monitoring of imports destined for the EU. ‚ÄúIn practical terms they (Britain and the EU) would have to operate in the same way or the whole thing would fall apart,‚Äù he said.

Bernard Jenkin, a member of parliament for May‚Äôs Conservative party, who backed Brexit in last year‚Äôs referendum, said he opposed continued EU oversight of UK borders. ‚ÄúThere is no need for an EU institution to police our customs, and we should not accept this,‚Äù he said in a statement.

‚ÄúAny dispute about each other‚Äôs customs arrangements should be settled by an independent arbitrator, as with any other international agreement, not by an institution which belongs only to one party of the agreement,‚Äù he added. Van Den Hende said the ECJ may not accept the creation of an independent body to oversea EU customs. Customs are a matter of EU law and the court is supposed to be the highest authority on this.

Also, the breadth of areas in which the UK wishes to retain free trade with Europe means many such independent arbitrators would be required. They would be needed to monitor enforcement of health standards, standards in financial services and rules that apply to a host of other regulated markets. ‚ÄúIn theory you can design that, but in practice neither the UK nor the EU would want that because you would be replicating institutions which already exist. It would be a huge amount of money and effort,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThis is in one of the fundamental problems about Brexit. The UK wants to retain deep integration but the UK doesn‚Äôt like the institutions that administer all this stuff,‚Äù Van Den Hende said.

Hockey India has appointed former captain Jude Felix Sebastian as the coach of the Indian junior men‚Äôs hockey team on Tuesday. The junior men‚Äôs team has recently performed well in Europe, which also included nine players from last year‚Äôs World Cup winning team.

The director of India‚Äôs High Performance, David John, has highlighted a point where he says that different programmes started by Hockey India, five-six years back, have helped in bringing more new talent and the junior players are giving their best to clinch their spot in the senior team.

The new coach Felix will train with the 33-member junior men‚Äôs team to defend their World Championship title. Expressing his views on Felix‚Äôs appointment, John said, ‚ÄúJude Felix brings with him vast experience as former India captain as well as a highly reputed coach. Under him, we want to strengthen the junior core group.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith Hockey India‚Äôs programmes structured to bring good results in the 2020 and 2024 Olympic Games, I would expect players from this junior core group to push the seniors for a spot in the team,‚Äù he added.

While playing for the Indian team, Felix used to be an important half-back in the side. He also received Arjuna Award in 1995 while he was the captaining the side. His captaincy tenure included the 1993 World Cup and 1994 Asian Games.

He featured in more than 250 international matches, and has played for India in two World Cups and two Asian Games, in 1990 and 1994. He has also represented the country in three Champions Trophies, in the year 1985, 1987 and 1989. In 1997, he also coached the Netherlands U-18 team.

In 2014, Felix also assisted the head coach of the national team, ‚ÄúI am excited to take up this new role. The junior core group was picked on the basis of their performance in the National Championships and this group will be further pruned down to a 18-member squad for the Sultan of Johor Cup, our first international tournament for this year,‚Äù said Felix.

Antonio Conte salutes his Chelsea fighters after battling display,"Antonio Conte as left saluting his side on Sunday after they edged Tottenham Hotspur 2-1. (Source: Reuters) Antonio Conte as left saluting his side on Sunday after they edged Tottenham Hotspur 2-1. (Source: Reuters)

For all the talk of crisis at Stamford Bridge following last week‚Äôs meltdown against Burnley, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was left saluting his side on Sunday after they edged Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 in a match they could just as easily have lost.

‚ÄúI think I must be pleased,‚Äù said Conte, whose nine-man side were beaten 3-2 by Burnley in their opening match of the new Premier League season. ‚ÄúI want to thank my players because they showed me great desire and heart and I saw today the fighters.‚Äù

The Italian was particularly pleased because the champions were without the suspended Cesc Fabregas and Gary Cahill, giving Tiemoue Bakayoko his debut and trusting Andreas Christensen at the heart of their defence.

But it was a couple of old hands in David Luiz and Marcos Alonso who stood out. The Brazilian was pushed forward into midfield and had a hand in both goals. Chelsea made the breakthrough against the run of play on 23 minutes when Alonso thumped home a superb free kick from 20 metres after Dele Alli had fouled Luiz.

But Luiz also stood strong when Spurs threatened to overrun Chelsea with the quickfire passing that served them so well last season. ‚ÄúDavid played very well, it was an amazing performance from him,‚Äù said Conte. ‚ÄúHe played with great experience and personality, a point of reference for other players. But it is easy to forget we had four new players from last season and we played like we wanted to show we were champions.‚Äù

Conte again said the club were working towards strengthening the squad in the transfer window, with at least three arrivals expected.

‚ÄúFor us it is very important to be focused on ourself. We know a lot of teams have improved since last season,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe club is trying to do its best in the transfer market but today I must be satisfied with my players because they gave me everything.‚Äù

Israeli PM Netanyahu to meet Russian President Putin over ‚Äòrecent development‚Äô in Syria,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Amir Cohen, Pool via AP/Files) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Amir Cohen, Pool via AP/Files)

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia next week to discuss ‚Äúrecent development‚Äù in Syria. A statement released by the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office on Saturday said the meeting will be held in Black Sea city of Sochi on Wednesday, Xinhua news agency reported.

The two leaders are expected to talk about the recent development in Syria, where Russian forces are fighting along with President Bashar Assad‚Äôs military, the statement said. The meeting would be held amid Iran‚Äôs alleged increasing presence in the war-torn country. ‚ÄúIt should be noted that over the past two years, Prime Minister Netanyahu has met President Putin once in every few months to discuss bilateral and regional issues to prevent friction between Israeli and Russian air forces in Syria,‚Äù the statement read.

Head of Israel‚Äôs Mossad national intelligence agency Yossi Cohen warned last week against ‚ÄúIranian expansion‚Äù into the regions that the Islamic State has relinquished in the Middle East. ‚ÄúThe areas where IS presence is decreasing, Iran is working to fill the void,‚Äù Cohen said.

According to the intelligence chief, Iran is expanding through its proxies and local allies in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. Israel worries that Iran will deploy its forces near the Syrian border with Israel, creating an Iranian stronghold next to the Jewish state.

Netanyahu has called on Russian and US leaders to contain Iranian presence in Syria in the framework of a possible cease-fire to end the eight-year-long civil war.

Israel has repeatedly declared it will not intervene in the fighting in Syria. However, Israel‚Äôs military responds to the random fire from Syria with artillery or airstrikes on posts of the Syrian army.

Victoria Azarenka withdraws from US Open amid child custody dispute,"Victoria Azarenka has not played since Wimbledon, and the former No. 1 player is now ranked 204th. (Source: AP) Victoria Azarenka has not played since Wimbledon, and the former No. 1 player is now ranked 204th. (Source: AP)

Two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka withdrew from the U.S. Open because she was unable to resolve a custody dispute with her infant son‚Äôs father.

The 28-year-old star from Belarus gave birth to her first child in December and she returned to the tour in June. She detailed the dispute with the boy‚Äôs father in a long Twitter post last week, saying she might not be able to bring her son with her to New York.

‚ÄúI am sadly unable to compete in this year‚Äôs U.S. Open due to my ongoing family situation that I am working through,‚Äù Azarenka said in a statement.

In last week‚Äôs post, Azarenka wrote that she separated from Leo‚Äôs father shortly after Wimbledon, where she lost to Simona Halep in the fourth round on July 10.

‚ÄúAs we work to resolve some of the legal processes, the way things stand now is that the only way I can play in the U.S. Open this year is if I leave Leo behind in California,‚Äù Azarenka wrote, ‚Äúwhich I‚Äôm not willing to do.‚Äù

Azarenka has not played since Wimbledon, and the former No. 1 player is now ranked 204th. She was the runner-up in New York in 2012 and 2013, losing in the final each year to Serena Williams. Those were also the years that Azarenka won her two Grand Slam singles titles in Australia.

Williams, who is pregnant with her first child, also will not play in this year‚Äôs U.S. Open. On the men‚Äôs side, three top-10 players have withdrawn with season-ending injuries: defending champion Stan Wawrinka, Novak Djokovic and Kei Nishikori.

"Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan: Fashion hits and misses of the week (Aug 13 ‚Äì Aug 19)","Hit and miss: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is a real beauty and probably that‚Äôs the reason why she can pull of almost anything with ease, even if the styling is not really commendable. Such is the case with her latest appearance at Manish Malhotra‚Äôs residence where she attended a party organised by the ace designer to celebrate his good friend, Sridevi‚Äôs birthday. The Ae Dil Hai Mushkil star stepped out in a lovely toga-inspired grey shimmer gown by Gaurav Gupta featuring an embellished neckline. If you ask us, the gown ticks all the right boxes for a simple yet elegant evening look and we would have been really happy with her choice for the soir√©e. But there‚Äôs a catch! Celebrity stylist Aastha Sharma who has worked with Aishwarya on a number of occasions, including Cannes 2017 red carpet, spoiled the look with a chainmail necklace. We wish she would have picked up something sleek in its place, it would have looked much better. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Hit and miss: At Saif Ali Khan's birthday party, Kareena Kapoor Khan‚Äôs nude lips became a talking point. Now, it might have looked good on her in person but going by the photos, it didn‚Äôt impress us much. In fact, it just added age to her face and the bronze make-up didn‚Äôt help either, it simply looked like she suffered sunburns. However, her choice of outfit is commendable. We love the gorgeous peek-a-boo Self-Portrait top which she paired with simple black leggings. (Source: Instagram/therealkarismakapoor)

Hit and miss: Deepika Padukone stepped out at the airport in a half gingham print and half pastel blue shirt and even though we applaud her for her sartorial experiment, it just failed to impress us. However, she totally aced her denim game in the fanciest and coolest pair ever! The 70s-inspired flared jeans are having a huge moment right now and Padukone took it to the next level with this one ‚Äì we love how it‚Äôs frayed at the ankles. You can pair it with almost anything, starting from statement tees to tank tops and halter-necks ‚Äì just make sure that your top isn‚Äôt baggy. You can complement your look like the Padmavati actor with a pair of Nike slides, minimum make-up, an updo and a pair of sunglasses. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

Miss: Having given us a series of stellar looks, Taapsee Pannu left us disappointed when she stepped out in a garish sari, jacket and belt by Aharin. There's absolutely nothing about this look that we like. Celebrity stylist Devki B could have done better, much better. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

Hit: We think Huma Qureshi looks really elegant in this simple black maxi. Even if it isn‚Äôt anything extraordinary, but paired with the patterned blue longlayered cape, it looks wonderful on her. Celebrity stylist Sanjana Batra who styled her, picked it up from Ritu Kumar and accessorised it well with Amrapali Jewels and Aquamarine Jewellery. Poker straight hair, smokey eyes, and a soft pink pout accentuated her beauty. (Source: Instagram/sanjanabatra)

Hit: With hair styled into thick retro waves by Shaan Muttathil, Jacqueline Fernandez chose to wear a gold lam√© off-shoulder top from Monisha Jaising and a basic fitted denim jeans. She completed her look with a pair of black shoes from Saint Laurent and accessorised with earrings from Top Shop and bracelet from Deepa Gurnani. (Source: Instagram/lakshmilehr)

Hit: Pooja Hegde was seen mixing prints and patterns well in a Nupur Kanoi sari. Although it's not something we would have picked up, we think the Mohenjo Daro actor wore it well. The way the sari was draped by celebrity stylist Tanya Ghavri reminded us of how women in Bengal wear it in this particular style with the pallu falling beautifully at the front. She accessorised it with earrings from heritage fine jewellery by Sunita Shekhawat and added a nice, modern vibe to her look with a wavy ponytail. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

Hit: Priyanka Chopra was seen in a black sheer number with a plunging neckline and a dangerously thigh-high slit from Fendi. A diamond studded brooch pinned on the front added instant glamour to the look, but we think even without one she would have looked good ‚Äì that is the beauty of the dress. She complemented the look with black peep toe heels, her signature brown lip shade, soft make-up and gorgeously tousled hair. (Source: Instagram/cristinaehrlich)

Hit: Deepika Padukone aced her airport style in basics. The white top (from Purple Paisley) and blue jeans (From Zara) combo is a classic and we love the way she casually shrugged on that denim jacket to add oomph to her too-cool-for-school look. The statement, ankle length boots and a pair of blue aviators made all the difference. It's something we would definitely like to try the next time we are jet-setting.

"In face of ‚Äògrim‚Äô sewer deaths, L-G moves for mechanisation","Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Anil Baijal. (Source: PTI) Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Anil Baijal. (Source: PTI)

Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal Monday directed the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to figure out a plan for ‚Äúmigration to 100 per cent mechanisation for cleaning of sewer/drains within 15 days‚Äù. He also asked DJB to lay down, within a week, the standard operating procedure (SOP) for emergency manual cleaning. Taking cognizance of the recent sewer deaths, the L-G chaired a high-level meeting attended by CM Arvind Kejriwal, PWD minister Satyendar Jain, Water Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam and the top officials of different departments at Raj Niwas.

The L-G issued the directions ‚Äúnoting that these deaths are a grim portrayal of the unsafe working conditions of people engaged to keep Delhi‚Äôs sewer lines and tanks clean, often with bare hands‚Äù ‚Äî a situation that he described as ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe ultimate goal must be to ensure complete mechanisation of cleaning of all drains/sewers, including the narrowest of them, deploying modern methods. For this, all stakeholders must work in a prompt and coordinated manner,‚Äù said the L-G‚Äôs office.

In a statement, the L-G‚Äôs office said Baijal has ‚Äúdirected CEO (DJB) to study and propose a plan for migration to 100 per cent mechanisation within 15 days in coordination with chairman, NDMC, and the commissioner of the South DMC. This SOP will be applied to all, including private contractors, group housing society, malls, etc.‚Äù The SC/ST department secretary was instructed to upload notifications ‚Äúclarifying the legal position on the website so that it can be in public domain for the benefit of contractors and users‚Äù.

The L-G also directed the DJB and other departments, including different civic bodies, to spread awareness about the ‚Äúharmful impact on the health of such workers as well as the illegality committed by the contractors or user agencies concerned‚Äù. Baijal also stressed that the ‚Äúliability of the principal employer‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be diluted, and asked ‚Äúgovernment agencies to strictly abide by the law‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe employers must provide gas masks, safety harness belts, helmets and mechanised equipment as legally mandated for the hazardous work of cleaning of clogged underground sewers,‚Äù the L-G‚Äôs office said. Baijal also directed Delhi Police to take action against ‚Äúcontractors who violate the law‚Äù.

Manny Pacquiao vs Jeff Horn rematch confirmed for Brisbane,"The fight is expected to be held in November at the Lang Park stadium. (Source: File) The fight is expected to be held in November at the Lang Park stadium. (Source: File)

Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao‚Äôs rematch with Australian Jeff Horn has been confirmed for Brisbane later this year, the city‚Äôs mayor said on Monday.

Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk had earlier threatened to pull funding without confirmation from the Pacquiao camp but said he had been reassured at a meeting with promoters on Monday.

‚ÄúI have had a meeting earlier today which has confirmed that Manny Pacquiao will definitely be in Brisbane this year for a rematch with Jeff Horn,‚Äù Quirk told local media.

The fight is expected to be held in November at the same Lang Park stadium where a packed crowd of 50,000 saw former schoolteacher Horn upset Pacquiao for the WBO welterweight belt in an unanimous 12-round decision last month.

Quirk said Brisbane Marketing, the city council‚Äôs major events subsidiary, would be re-engaged for negotiations with promoters Top Rank and Duco Events.

‚ÄúIt was a matter of Manny Pacquiao deciding whether he wanted to take up that clause in the contract to give a rematch in the event that he lost,‚Äù Quirk added.

Horn‚Äôs surprise win over 38-year-old Pacquiao caused controversy, with many observers outraged by the decision. But a WBO scoring review later endorsed Horn as the rightful winner.

Everton‚Äôs Ronald Koeman targets two more signings,"Everton, with a 2-0 lead, visit Croatian side Hajduk Split for the return leg of their Europa League playoff on Thursday. (Source: AP) Everton, with a 2-0 lead, visit Croatian side Hajduk Split for the return leg of their Europa League playoff on Thursday. (Source: AP)

Everton have already spent more than 100 million pounds ($128.54 million) to bolster their squad over the summer but are targeting two more signings before the transfer window shuts, manager Ronald Koeman has said.

After bringing in Wayne Rooney, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Davy Klaassen, Micheal Keane, Jordan Pickford, Sandro Ramirez and Cuco Martina, Koeman is keen to add more depth in defence and attack.

‚ÄúWe are looking for a left-footed central defender, maybe as back-up for Leighton Baines,‚Äù Koeman told Sky Sports following Monday‚Äôs 1-1 draw at Manchester City.

‚ÄúWith the injury to Funes Mori we don‚Äôt have any left-footers on that side as a back-up for Leighton. ‚ÄúAlso a striker because I think even with the talent of Dominic and Ramirez, look to other squads. They have that number of players. If we need to make the next step we need a striker in as well.‚Äù

Rooney‚Äôs 200th Premier League goal put Everton ahead after 35 minutes before Kyle Walker was sent off on his home debut for City just before the half-time.

City equalised following a late goal from substitute Raheem Sterling before Everton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin was shown a red card.

‚ÄúWe had problems with keeping the ball and we played too fast the long ball. We worked really hard for the result, and one point is a good result,‚Äù said Koeman.

Everton, with a 2-0 lead, visit Croatian side Hajduk Split for the return leg of their Europa League playoff on Thursday before visiting defending Premier League champions Chelsea on Sunday.

Udaipur‚Äôs Kalpit Veerwal in Limca book of records for 100 per cent in JEE-Mains,"Veerwal scored 360 out of 360 in the JEE-Mains this year and is now studying Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. Veerwal scored 360 out of 360 in the JEE-Mains this year and is now studying Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.

The first-ever student to have scored 100 pc in the prestigious Joint Entrance Examination-Mains, Udaipur boy Kalpit Veerwal has made it to the Limca Book of Records for his feat. Veerwal scored 360 out of 360 in the JEE-Mains this year and is now studying Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.

His record of the perfect score will feature under the ‚ÄúEducation Achievements‚Äù category of the 2018 edition, an official from the Limca Book of Records said. ‚ÄúI was confident of cracking the examination but didn‚Äôt expect a perfect score. Similarly, making it to the Limca Book of Records was not something I ever dreamt of,‚Äù Veerwal told PTI over phone from Mumbai.

Veerwal‚Äôs home city of Udaipur is not more than 300 km from Kota, which is referred to as country‚Äôs ‚Äúcoaching hub‚Äù because of large number of medical and engineering aspirants who go there for their preparations. ‚ÄúI did not study for 15 hours a day, I did not go down the usual ‚ÄòKota route‚Äô for IIT preparations but consistent studies helped me a lot,‚Äù he said.

Veerwal‚Äôs father Pushpendra Veerwal is a nurse at the Maharana Bhupal Government Hospital in Rajasthan‚Äôs Udaipur while his mother Pushpa is a government school teacher. His elder brother is pursuing MBBS from AIIMS, Jodhpur. ‚ÄúAll we want for our children was to study at good colleges and land up jobs that could help them in easy survival. We never pressured them to come first in class, score 90 per cent, get the top rank or bag a job that would make them millionaires.

‚ÄúEverybody suggested that we should send him to Kota or Hyderabad for coaching but we decided not to put him under any extra pressure and enrol him in an institute here. But him making a record is not something we ever expected,‚Äù his father told PTI. Veerwal scored 109th rank in the JEE-Advanced. Out of the over 11.8 lakh students, who appeared for the examination for admission to various IITs and engineering colleges, around 2.2 lakh have qualified for the second and final round ‚Äî the JEE (Advanced).

Veerwal had also topped the Indian Junior Science Olympiad in class 9 and bagged the top spot in the National Talent Search Examination in Class 10. A student of MDS Senior Secondary School in Udaipur, Veerwal took coaching from Resonance institute there.

Car depot at Aarey: Activists see red over MMRC ad,"Activists have alleged that the metro implementing body has published ‚Äúlies‚Äù through the advertisement and have refuted them with other government documents. Activists have alleged that the metro implementing body has published ‚Äúlies‚Äù through the advertisement and have refuted them with other government documents.

The battle for Aarey Milk Colony intensified Monday after activists were up in arms over an advertisement issued by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC). On Monday, the MMRC released an advertisement informing the citizens about the Metro 3 car depot at Aarey Milk Colony. Activists have alleged that the metro implementing body has published ‚Äúlies‚Äù through the advertisement and have refuted them with other government documents.

‚ÄúThey have published false statements in the ad. A public body cannot release an ad like this and lie about it. If what they are doing is right, then why do they have to issue a public appeal,‚Äù said Zoru Bhathena, an activist. Meanwhile, Stalin Dayanand from the NGO Vanashakti has written to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis with documents that contend the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù put out by the MMRC and again appealed to him to prevent the destruction of Aarey.

‚ÄùPublic money has been used to give an advertisement which is factually incorrect and conceals the truth. We citizens and NGOs do not have the luxury of spending and access to massive quantum of public money. Hence, we are writing to you in the hope that you will honour your words and stand up for protection of trees, forests, green spaces,‚Äù he wrote.

In the ad, MMRC claimed ‚ÄòAarey Car Depot site has been selected on technical ground after examining all alternatives‚Äô. However, the activists disputed the statement with a Government Resolution dated October 16, 2015 in which alternatives were mentioned. The GR stated: ‚ÄúIn the overall scenario when GOM is considering construction of Kanjur Marg-Jogeshwari corridor and constructing a depot with lesser impact on trees costs an additional amount of Rs 750 cr, the Committee considers that larger benefits will be achieved by adopting the following: a) construct the main depot of line 3 at Kanjur Marg by integrating Colaba-SEEPZ corridor (MML-3) with Jogeshwari-Kanjur Marg corridor.‚Äù

While the ad claims that there are no restraining orders by the NGT against a car depot in Aarey, in an application before the Bombay High Court on August 31, 2015, the Collector (Mumbai suburban district) contended, ‚ÄúThe applicant states there is no other suitable land available for the said component of the project. The applicant states that the land at Aarey Milk Colony was initially sought to be utilised for the said purposes. However, the same has been ruled out as the said land falls in an Eco Sensitive zone. The applicant states that the National Green Tribunal, Western Zone Bench by an order dated 19th August, 2015, passed in Application No. 34/2015 (WZ) has directed the authorities to maintain status quo till further orders.‚Äù

MMRC claimed that no real estate development is proposed in the car depot. However, a GR dated March 16, 2016, reveals the adjoining three hectares land will be used for the purpose. The GR states that the 3 hectares land should be transferred to MMRDA for metro car depot workshop use and commercial use, in context of raising funds through property development. MMRC refused to comment on the objections.

"Sexual assault video of woman on Casablanca bus sparks outrage, arrests","(Representational Image) (Representational Image)

A video of a young woman being sexually assaulted by a gang of teenage boys on a bus in Casablanca has sparked outrage in Morocco, reigniting a bitter debate about violence against women in the Muslim country. The video, which was posted on social media on Sunday, shows four boys sexually molesting a woman while laughing, tearing her clothes off and insulting her in Arabic.

The woman ‚Äì who the authorities said had learning difficulties ‚Äì is seen in tears, crying for help, while neither the bus driver nor any of the passengers intervene. Sexual harassment and abuse of women is rife in Morocco where a national survey found that nearly two-thirds of women had experienced physical, psychological, sexual or economic abuse. Earlier in August a video showing a mob of men hounding a young woman on a street in Tangier caused uproar in the media.

On Monday the Moroccan authorities said they had arrested six boys aged 15 to 17 for their ‚Äúpresumed implication in the woman‚Äôs aggression‚Äù and put them under investigation. While the video sparked widespread condemnation on social and local media, some users accused the woman of having ‚Äúprovoked the men with indecent clothing‚Äù. One man wrote on Facebook that ‚ÄúI condemn the act but cover yourselves up, this one was easy to undress.‚Äù

Moroccan charity Don‚Äôt Touch My Child called for any witnesses to come forward ‚Äúto bring to justice this barbaric horde who shamefully attacked a young women‚Äù. Public transport company M‚ÄôDina Bus condemned the incident and said it was collaborating with authorities in the north African kingdom, which is trying to attract investors and tourists by presenting itself as a safe haven.

"Only dates, no orders today: Court official","Flooded streets of Sector 33, Chandigarh, on Monday. (Express Photo by Sahil Walia) Flooded streets of Sector 33, Chandigarh, on Monday. (Express Photo by Sahil Walia)

THE HEAVY downpour in Chandigarh on Monday not only threw traffic out of gear around the city but also brought the district courts at Sector 43 to a halt. The torrential rain hit power supply with the generator room flooded. Since the room is in the basement, water from the windows filled up the room due to which the genset had to be shut down immediately.

As the day began, there was no power supply at the local courts as the generator had been turned off, resulting in the official court work suffering the most. In almost every court, the staff was seen standing outside the court premises waiting to get the generator started. When a court official was asked whether any judgment had been passed, he said, ‚ÄúThere are only dates and no orders today. With no electricity, the computers are not working and only manual work can be done.‚Äù

‚ÄúI arrived today at 9 am and when I entered the office, i.e the courtroom, there was no electricity due to which no orders were given by the court today,‚Äù added another official. Suspension of work due to power supply blockage also got the judges worried as senior judges even took a round of the genset room twice to check if work was being done properly as it was hampering the court.

How China gained from Partition,"China was not only good at exploiting the great power conflicts to its own benefit, its leaders also clearly saw the strategic implications of Partition. (Representational Image) China was not only good at exploiting the great power conflicts to its own benefit, its leaders also clearly saw the strategic implications of Partition. (Representational Image)

The occasional reflections on the tragedies of Partition rarely include the consideration of its geopolitical consequences. The sundering of the political space in the Subcontinent gets a lot less attention in the narratives of independent India‚Äôs international relations than the sentimental accounts of Delhi‚Äôs non-alignment and moralpolitik.

Even today, it is not easy for the Indian elites to recognise that the geopolitical legacies of Partition remain the biggest drag on India‚Äôs larger global aspirations. None of it more important than the fact that China has turned out to be the biggest long-term beneficiary from the division of the Subcontinent.

Nothing illustrates the different geopolitical evolution of India and China since the mid 20th century than the simple question of territorial consolidation. Consider the following: India was divided in 1947 and China was united in 1949. The Subcontinent‚Äôs great partition locked the successor states ‚Äî India and Pakistan ‚Äî in a perennial conflict. China overcame an era of fragmentation to come together as a strong nation.

If the British Raj emerged as a powerful state by generating a measure of political and administrative coherence to the Subcontinent, its dissolution accompanied by division resulted in the strategic diminution of its successor states, India and Pakistan.

The combination of British power and the massive resources of an undivided Subcontinent created what came to be known as the ‚ÄúIndia Centre‚Äù that dominated the geopolitics of Asia and the Indian Ocean. Indian capital and labour, its armies and administrative systems were central to political stability, economic globalisation and the spread of modernising ideologies in the eastern hemisphere.

Before Partition, India‚Äôs energies ‚Äî economic and military ‚Äî radiated outwards. After Partition, the Subcontinent‚Äôs energies turned inward in defence of the new political borders. If the Anglos are widely seen as the main villains behind Partition ‚Äî the British for their divide and rule tactics and the American integration of Pakistan into the Cold War politics ‚Äî it is hard to see how the West benefited from Partition.

The Anglo-American initiatives to replace the India Centre with such new regional security structures as SEATO and CENTO flopped. For there was no real possibility of effective regional security without the participation of India. The efforts by Washington and London to mediate between India and Pakistan in order to generate a more coherent bastion against international communism, for example in the wake of the 1962 war between India and China, did not succeed either.

To make matters even more interesting, the communist giants, Russia and China fell apart at the turn of the 1960s and opened the door for the American strategic partnership with China that would contribute enormously to Beijing‚Äôs rise as a great power. China was not only good at exploiting the great power conflicts to its own benefit, its leaders also clearly saw the strategic implications of Partition. They also saw the opportunities to probe independent India‚Äôs limitations in sustaining primacy in the Subcontinent and the Indian Ocean that it had inherited from the Raj.

In the early decades after Partition, China seemed relatively marginal to South Asian geopolitics. India‚Äôs energies were focused on opposing the Anglo-American co-option of Pakistan into the Cold War alliance system and the supply of Western arms to the Pakistan military. India bet that it could manage the inherent contradictions with China through a conscious befriending of Beijing. But the outcomes abound in paradoxes.

Given the anti-Communist orientation of CENTO and SEATO, you would have thought China would view Pakistan with suspicion and embrace an India that chose to remain non-aligned and refused to support the Cold War alliances. China, however, found it hard to reciprocate India‚Äôs love ‚Äî wrapped in the slogans of Panchsheel and Asian solidarity against Western imperialism. Instead Beijing built an all-weather partnership with Rawalpindi that would grow from strength to strength and remain the one constant feature of the Subcontinent‚Äôs international politics.

If India could not stop seeing China through an ideological prism even after 1962, Beijing consistently viewed Rawalpindi through a geopolitical lens. For one, the Chinese leaders saw no real contradictions with Pakistan, despite its pro-Western orientation. Beijing also rightly assessed that ideological slogans are not adequate to overcome major disputes over territorial sovereignty with Delhi.

Even more important, China understood that strong support to Pakistan was a critical element in limiting any future challenges from India. Hence the bilateral deal with Pakistan on Kashmir in the early 1960s, nuclear cooperation in the 1970s and 1980s following India‚Äôs first nuclear test in 1974, the transfer of missile technology in the 1990s, and the effective integration of Pakistan‚Äôs structures into China‚Äôs own military planning on defence production, interoperability and power projection over the last two decades.

For China, Partition is a gift that continues to give. Meanwhile, its growing economic resources, military capabilities and political influence have dramatically improved Beijing‚Äôs ability to exploit India‚Äôs difficulties with its smaller neighbours as well. Whether it is trade and investment, creation of infrastructure or the supply of armaments, it is China the looms large over the Subcontinent. After years trying to limit Western influences in its neighbourhood, India now finds halting China‚Äôs penetration of the Subcontinent will need a lot more political will and strategic purpose.

US: Border agents track drone from sky to drugs on the ground,"Authorities say agents found Rivera with the methamphetamine in a lunch box and a 2-foot (0.6-meter) drone hidden in a nearby bush. (Representational photo) Authorities say agents found Rivera with the methamphetamine in a lunch box and a 2-foot (0.6-meter) drone hidden in a nearby bush. (Representational photo)

A 25-year-old US citizen has been charged with using a drone to smuggle more than 13 pounds (5.9 kilograms) of methamphetamine from Mexico by drone, an unusually large seizure for what is still a novel technique to bring illegal drugs into the United States, authorities said Friday.

Jorge Edwin Rivera told authorities that he used drones to smuggle drugs five or six times since March, typically delivering them to an accomplice at a nearby gas station in San Diego, according to a statement of probable cause. He said he was to be paid $1,000 for the attempt that ended in his arrest.

Border Patrol agents in San Diego allegedly saw the drone in flight on Aug. 8 and tracked it to Rivera about 2,000 yards (1,830 meters) from the Mexico border. Authorities say agents found Rivera with the methamphetamine in a lunch box and a 2-foot (0.6-meter) drone hidden in a nearby bush.

The US Drug Enforcement Administration said in a recent annual report that drones are not often used to smuggle drugs from Mexico because they can only carry small loads, though it said they may become more common. In 2015, two people pleaded guilty to dropping 28 pounds (12.7 kilograms) of heroin from a drone in the border town of Calexico, California. That same year, Border Patrol agents in San Luis, Arizona, spotted a drone dropping bundles with 30 pounds (13.61 kilograms) of marijuana.

Alana Robinson, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California, said drones haven‚Äôt appealed to smugglers because their noise attracts attention and battery life is short. Also, payloads pale compared to other transportation methods, like hidden vehicle compartments, boats or tunnels.

As technology addresses those shortcomings, Robinson expects drones to become more attractive to smugglers. The biggest advantage for them is that the drone operator can stay far from where the drugs are dropped, making it less likely to get caught. ‚ÄúThe Border Patrol is very aware of the potential and are always listening and looking for drones,‚Äù Robinson said.

Benjamin Davis, Rivera‚Äôs attorney, declined to comment. Rivera is being held without bail and is scheduled to be arraigned September 7.

Integrity unit assessing Alexandr Dolgopolov-Thiago Monteiro match,"Concerns on suspicious betting patterns surrounded the match between Alexandr Dolgopolov and Thiago Monteiro (Source: Reuters) Concerns on suspicious betting patterns surrounded the match between Alexandr Dolgopolov and Thiago Monteiro (Source: Reuters)

The Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) have confirmed they are looking into a match between Alexandr Dolgopolov and Thiago Monteiro after concerns were raised over suspicious betting patterns surrounding the contest on Sunday.

A spokesman for the TIU, the anti-corruption body that covers all professional tennis around the world, told Reuters on Monday that they were making an assessment of the match while also insisting that no formal investigation had been launched.

Brazil‚Äôs Monteiro beat Ukrainian Dolgopolov 6-3 6-3 at the Winston-Salem Open, an ATP 250 event in the U.S., in Sunday‚Äôs first round match.

Monteiro, ranked 114 in the world, took just 55 minutes to beat Dolgopolov, who was ranked 51 places higher at 63, in a match which saw the Ukrainian fail to earn even one break point.

Dolgopolov had been the pre-match favourite but in the hours leading up to the match, so much money was placed on Monteiro that he started the match as an odds-on chance. It prompted several leading bookmakers to stop taking bets.

The TIU statement on Monday said it had been ‚Äúmade aware of concerns over betting patterns during the match.

‚ÄúAs with all match alerts, the TIU will assess, make a judgement and take appropriate action on the information received through its co-operative agreements with betting operators.‚Äù

Does AIADMK have the numbers to remain in power in Tamil Nadu? Here‚Äôs where they stand,"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami (R) with his predecessor O Panneerselvam (PTI Photo/File) Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami (R) with his predecessor O Panneerselvam (PTI Photo/File)

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) working president MK Stalin on Tuesday wrote to Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao seeking a floor test in the Assembly. Citing an ‚Äúunprecedented constitutional crisis‚Äù, he said the present government under Chief Minister Edapaddi K Palaniswami has lost majority in the House. While the two factions of the AIADMK, one under the Chief Minister and the other under former CM O Panneerselvam, merged on Monday, a third rival unit claiming loyalty to TTV Dinakaran has revolted against the party.

In his letter to the Governor, Stalin, the Leader of Opposition, stated: ‚ÄúAs a leader of Opposition, I request the Hon‚Äôble Governor to direct Thiru Edapadi K Palaniswami to prove his majority in the Tamilnadu Legislative Assembly immediately.‚Äù

Dinakaran and his MLAs are contesting the government‚Äôs decision to remove VK Sasikala from her post as general secretary of the party ‚Äî Dinakaran is Sasikala‚Äôs nephew. They are threatening to approach the Governor with a memorandum stating that they have lost faith in the government under Palaniswami. Read: 20 MLAs behind him, TTV Dinakaran to first target CM, meet Governor

In the case of the floor test, will the AIADMK be able to make up the numbers and remain in power?

In the 234-member Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, which was reduced to 233 after the death of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa and the cancellation of the RK Nagar by-polls, the AIADMK needs at least 117 votes to remain in power. Right now, the two-leaf party has 134 seats in the Assembly, excluding the House Speaker‚Äôs and Jayalalithaa‚Äôs. However, while Palaniswami claims to have 104 MLAs on his side and Panneerselvam 10, Dinakaran has at least 22 including three Independent MLAs, and his numbers are likely to shoot up.

The two warring factions of the AIADMK, under EPS and OPS, currently have only 114 votes, three short of what is needed to remain in power.

"Triple talaq illegal now, no need for legislation: BJP","Muslim women celebrating Supreme Court‚Äôs verdict on triple talaq. (Express photo by Vishal) Muslim women celebrating Supreme Court‚Äôs verdict on triple talaq. (Express photo by Vishal)

With the Supreme Court holding triple talaq invalid and ordering legislation through Parliament on it, the BJP on Tuesday said the practice has already been declared illegal so there is no need for the government to make a law for it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a historic decision. The prime minister and our government have been sensitive to Muslim women‚Äôs concerns. The government has, through a number of affidavits, have taken their side,‚Äù BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs illegal now. It was a big battle. There is no need for a legislation. That has always been illegal and the Supreme Court has declared it illegal,‚Äù he added. Hussain also accused the opposition Congress for ‚Äúignoring the pain‚Äù of Muslim women so far.

During the run up to the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the BJP had highlighted the issue of tripple talaq which its leaders said had made many Muslim women softened their opposition to the BJP. It‚Äôs leaders had said many Muslim women had voted for the party candidates in their respective constituencies due to the party‚Äôs move to take up the miseries of women belonging to the minority community.

In a landmark verdict, the Supreme Court put the curtains down on a 1,400 year old practice of ‚Äòtriple talaq‚Äô among Muslims and set it aside on several grounds including that it was against the basic tenets of the Holy Quran and violated the Islamic law Shariat.

A five-judge Constitution bench, by a majority of 3:2 in which the Chief Justice J S Khehar was in minority, said in a one line order: ‚ÄúIn view of the different opinions recorded by a majority of 3:2, the practice of ‚Äòtalaq-e-biddat‚Äô ‚Äì triple talaq is set aside.‚Äù

"No need for new law on instant triple talaq; SC verdict sufficient, says Govt","The Centre is also all set to send an advisory to all states asking them to ensure compliance of the Supreme Court order. The Centre is also all set to send an advisory to all states asking them to ensure compliance of the Supreme Court order.

The government today virtually ruled out the need for a new law on instant triple talaq, which has been rendered as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, indicating that existing laws, including the one dealing with domestic violence, were sufficient.

‚ÄúThe government will consider the issue in a structured manner. A prima facie reading of the judgement makes it clear that the majority (of the five-member bench) has held it (instant triple talaq) as unconstitutional and illegal,‚Äù Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

Hailing it as a ‚Äúgreat victory‚Äù for those who believe that personal laws must be progressive, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the verdict is the law of the land now. He also said many parts of the Islamic world have rejected the triple talaq practice.

Asked how the SC verdict striking down the practice of triple talaq would be implemented and why a statute is not necessary for the order‚Äôs enforcement, a senior government functionary explained that a marriage will not be annulled if the husband resorts to instant triple talaq.

‚ÄúAfter the Supreme Court order, if a husband gives instant triple talaq, it will not be considered valid. His obligation towards the marriage will remain‚Ä¶ The wife is also free to drag such a person to police and file a complaint of harassment or domestic violence,‚Äù the functionary said, indicating penal provisions are present to check the practice.

The Centre is also all set to send an advisory to all states asking them to ensure compliance of the Supreme Court order. A home ministry spokesperson said the ministry will be asking the state governments to take appropriate action and ensure compliance of the Supreme Court order.

While Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice S Abdul Nazeer were in favour of putting on hold for six months the practice of triple talaq and asking the government to come out with a law in this regard, justices Kurian Joseph, R F Nariman and U U Lalit held it as violative of the Constitution.

The majority verdict said any practice including triple talaq which is against the tenets of Quran is unacceptable. The three judges also said the practice of divorce through triple talaq is manifestly arbitrary and violative of the Constitution and must be struck down.

The minority verdict by CJI Khehar and Justice Nazeer, which favoured keeping on hold the practise of triple talaq for six months, asked the political parties to set aside their differences and help the Centre in coming out with a legislation.

The judges in the minority verdict said that if the Centre does not bring a law within six months, then its injunction on triple talaq will continue.

"In Bawana, 3 campaign strategies with a common aim","Chief Minister Kejriwal meets residents at Pooth Khurd, Sunday (Prem Nath Pandey) Chief Minister Kejriwal meets residents at Pooth Khurd, Sunday (Prem Nath Pandey)

At Lal flats in Bawana‚Äôs Pooth Khurd around 4.20 pm on Sunday, locals sporting white caps and holding posters and flags waited for Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was to enter the colony in 10 minutes. As a car pulled up just before 4.30, a child stole one look at the man who stepped out and ran to his mother, saying: ‚ÄúYe Kejriwal hai? Kejriwal aa gaya?‚Äù Having realised that it was him, a crowd gathered, raising slogans of ‚ÄòBharat Mata ki Jai‚Äô and ‚ÄòInquilab Zindabad.‚Äô

With a day left for the August 23 Bawana bypoll ‚Äî being held after AAP MLA Ved Prakash joined the BJP ‚Äî the party held meetings with residents of the constituency over the weekend. According to sources, the party had made a conscious decision to use the Delhi CM sparingly during the campaign. The party‚Äôs logic, a senior leader said, ‚Äúwas to fight the election on issues, rather than personalities‚Äù.

At the colony, the CM listened to complaints of residents. ‚ÄúThere are thekas here which sell illegal liquour‚Ä¶ Police are also involved. Please stop this,‚Äù said a resident. Kalawati, another resident, who was buying water from a tanker, made sure to yell out her grievance so as to reach the CM‚Äôs ears: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt get water here. We have to buy water ‚Äî Rs 5 for filling up a small utensil, and a bigger bucket for Rs 10.‚Äù

Before leaving the venue, Kejriwal promised to look into issues of water, electricity and illegal thekas, but said DTC bus connectivity would take time. Following a series of electoral losses ‚Äî in the Punjab Assembly elections, the MCD polls and the Rajouri Garden bypoll ‚Äî the party is pinning its hopes on Bawana. The AAP‚Äôs campaign in the area had started weeks before the bypoll was announced. Kejriwal had made a series of visits to villages around Bawana, talking about how the party ‚Äúwas the only one that cared about rural Delhi‚Äù.

DDCA rejects national selector Sarandeep Singh‚Äôs application,"Sarandeep Singh had written a letter to CAC stating that he would like to become chairman of selectors free of cost. Sarandeep Singh had written a letter to CAC stating that he would like to become chairman of selectors free of cost.

The Cricket Affairs Committee (CAC) of the DDCA headed by Madan Lal has shot down national selector Sarandeep Singh‚Äôs plea of being considered for the chairmanship of state team‚Äôs selection committee. Sarandeep had written a letter to CAC stating that he would like to become chairman of selectors free of cost.

However, on Monday it was found that Sarandeep was not even summoned for an interview as he does not fit the criteria as per Lodha Committee Recommendations.

‚ÄúYes, Sarandeep‚Äôs plea has been rejected. If he were to become Delhi selector, he would have had to leave his national selector‚Äôs job as Lodha Panel Reforms does not allow multiple post for a single person. Therefore, even if he wanted to do the assignment on a Pro Bono (free of cost) basis, it was not possible,‚Äù a senior DDCA official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

Sarandeep‚Äôs contention was that his colleagues in the national selection committee MSK Prasad and Devang Gandhi are both chairman of their respective state selection committees.

‚ÄúAt DDCA, we do not wish to deviate from the Lodha panel reforms. We can‚Äôt say why Bengal or Andhra is allowing Devang and Prasad to continue in their respective positions,‚Äù the official added.

Sarandeep is currently in Sri Lanka tracking the ODI team‚Äôs performance. However his former teammate Vijay Dahiya, who is also in Sri Lanka, appeared for the coaches‚Äô interview via Skype.

Meanwhile, the first round interviews for the selection of coaches and selectors were held at the Feroz Shah Kotla today. The five-member CAC headed by Lal interviewed the candidates asking them questions on their vision, the kind of squad they would like to build and the choice of support staff.

‚ÄúMy interview went off well. I was asked questions on various topics of coaching. I feel confident,‚Äù said former Bengal stalwart Ashok Malhotra.

However, the ones who are expected to be frontrunners are Vijay Dahiya, Manoj Prabhakar and last year‚Äôs coach KP Bhaskar.

It was learnt that some of the candidates who appeared for selector‚Äôs interview then expressed their keenness to become BCCI match-referee.

One such candidate was Delhi fast bowler Feroz Ghayas, who appeared for selector‚Äôs interview but expressed his interest in becoming a domestic match referee. Ghayas had earlier been a match-referee before he had migrated to the United States.

In a separate incident, members of Delhi Cricket Coaches Association protested in front of the Kotla for being deemed ineligible for the Delhi coach‚Äôs job across age groups. They have submitted a deputation to DDCA administrator Vikramjit Sen and CAC chairman Lal.

Ashton Agar confident to make Test comeback a success,"Ashton Agar said that he is prepared as a cricketer and it is pleasing to be back. Ashton Agar said that he is prepared as a cricketer and it is pleasing to be back.

Making his comeback to the Australian Test squad after a gap of four years, left-arm spinner Ashton Agar has said that he feels that the time away from the game has made him a better cricketer and he is happy to be back in the team. He is all set to partner Nathan Lyon when Australia begin their two-Test series in Dhaka from August 27.

Agar, who was dropped from the squad after the 2013-14 Ashes series in England, was picked after some strong performances in the domestic circuit and is raring to go in Bangladesh.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just four years of experience,‚Äù Agar said, of the time he spent away from the international circuit. ‚ÄúFour years of extra bowling and naturally you get better the more you bowl. I just learnt the game of cricket over the four years playing for WA. It‚Äôs just a lot of time to learn about myself. I worked on all part of my game and that‚Äôs why I am enjoying,‚Äô he said.

He hogged the limelight after playing a 98-run innings coming in at number 11 in his debut Test against England but failed as a spinner. He now says that he is prepared as a cricketer and it is pleasing to be back.

‚ÄúObviously lot depends on what the wickets look like, but I am ready to go if I get the nod,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm preparing pretty well and I have done everything I can so now I feel like everything is in really good order and now it‚Äôs really pleasing to be around the Test group.

‚ÄúIt is what you want to do and it‚Äôs a great bunch of guys to be here around [with]. So it is good fun,‚Äô he said, adding that he is very optimistic about his chances in the series opener. I am very hopeful. If he[Lehman] said he is going to play two spinners, I am well placed.

‚ÄúI guess the pressure is what you put on yourself. To me, I have to not put too much pressure on myself and go and try and enjoy the game,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúPlay my role in the team and express myself in the middle. I still remain away from all the distractions and all the talks. I did not know that I had a press conference yesterday and that is the way I am doing,‚Äù he added.

Talking about Bangladesh, Agar said that they have met couple of times and Australia are focused on their own work instead of thinking about Bangladesh.

‚ÄúWe had a couple of meetings. Threats‚Ä¶ I am not sure how we look at it. We focus more on ourselves and on our skills and how we can beat them on skills. We have analysed all their players and we do that properly in all our meetings. We are worried bit more on ourselves as we can control that,‚Äù he said.

"Badminton World Championships: For PV Sindhu, the Worlds is her oyster","PV Sindhu has previously won two World Cup bronze medals. (Express Photo by Shivani Naik) PV Sindhu has previously won two World Cup bronze medals. (Express Photo by Shivani Naik)

PV Sindhu tells the story of her first World Championship medal in 2013 with some wondrous detailing of how it felt to star in the tale. ‚ÄúIt was a great moment. It was much before the Olympics, and the Chinese used to be very strong. No one could have guessed that some Indian girl would just come and beat the Chinese and win a medal,‚Äù she says with a happy shrug, a day before she sets out to for a third shy at the podium ‚Äî preferably silver or gold. The 22-year-old has had enough losses in her career on either side of those back-to-back medals ‚Äî and against terribly unfancied names in frightfully early rounds ‚Äî to fall back into the character of being just ‚Äúsome Indian girl.‚Äù Till that afternoon in Rio.

There aren‚Äôt too many Indians who can say an Olympic silver medal was the start of something beautiful. For most, it would be the pinnacle of their achievements. But Sindhu‚Äôs world became one of immense possibilities the day she won silver at the 2016 Games. We should‚Äôve known sky‚Äôs the limit when she won the first bronze, India‚Äôs first in women‚Äôs singles. There was a second bronze a year later, just to be sure. A pattern had emerged, and Rio confirmed it ‚Äî Sindhu was meant for the big stage. At the Glasgow Worlds, India can get ready for another brush with bonafide global success all over again. Because here is a career carefully crafted and minutely monitored for excellence at the majors.

Modern sport sees wisdom drilled into Under-25s by coaches and the support team with such pin-pointedness that you want to look behind their ears and check for Bluetooth devices. Not a word out of place, it‚Äôs as if voices in their heads are edited for enunciation. ‚ÄúResponsibilities are high because I head into the Worlds as an Olympic silver medallist. But I‚Äôve trained enough to deal with everything,‚Äù Sindhu says, at once straddling both the adult sincerity of keeping a reputation intact and a child‚Äôs implicit belief that physical rigour will help her face anything thrown at her.

Before and after

For all purposes though, Sindhu‚Äôs life until this moment is divided into Before Rio and After Rio. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve changed the way I physically and mentally approach a big tournament. But after Rio, the confidence just increased a lot,‚Äù she says. Even two World Championship medals ‚Äì beating the top Chinese names on the way, hadn‚Äôt given her the cushioning that Rio‚Äôs affirmation finally did. That Sindhu can win at will was proven at the India Open in April. ‚ÄúEveryone was saying they couldn‚Äôt come and watch in Rio. So I enjoyed beating Carolina (Marin) and winning the title in front of my home fans and family,‚Äù she says.

Marin‚Äôs mental tutoring is also along carefully constructed lines. ‚ÄúI am not looking at the Worlds to defend a title. I am fighting for a new one,‚Äù she says shadow-boxing against piled pressure. ‚ÄúI need to forget about the Olympics. This is a new tournament,‚Äù she adds.

Sindhu‚Äôs lighthearted memory of the Olympic final is how high-pitched and voluble it got. To a question on how ‚Äòstroppy‚Äô the women players could get off-court, she would chuckle, ‚ÄúYou know what happened at the Olympics, right? We kept screaming at each other! But of course, off court, we‚Äôre friendly.‚Äù Going forward, it‚Äôs this lightness of being ‚Äî as tutored as it might be ‚Äî which will play a big part in moulding how she approaches her biggest matches.

Before Rio, there was quite another Sindhu who had melted at the first sight of pressure. Tipped to win the Commonwealth Games gold, she would twice lose to Canadian Michelle Li in the 2014 edition ‚Äî the semifinals leading to a rare lashing from coach P Gopichand that had left her in muffled tears. At some level, it was the turning point in her career, for never again would she go down in battle for being afraid to lose. ‚ÄúYea, I got a bronze then,‚Äù she says wryly, having picked herself up from the loss to put her head down and win the third-place playoff.

Team physio C Kiran says she never really fell apart ‚Äî even at the height of dealing with the foot injury when she sat in a chair and strengthened her upper body. It‚Äôs been an upward curve ever since ‚Äî with her losses best interpreted as studied silences in less important fixtures, lying in wait for this World Championship challenge.

As such, even Marin‚Äôs absence from the title-winners‚Äô list since the Olympics ‚Äî she has three finals through what was believed to be a tough back injury ‚Äî ought to be read as her peaking towards the Worlds. It would be foolish to write her off ‚Äî and her planning meticulously included training in Spain‚Äôs San Sebastien, to acclimatise to conditions similar to Glasgow.

While Tai Tzu Ying has robbed the Worlds of its strongest contender by opting to play the World Universiade, there are enough women who will make it the showpiece event at Glasgow. In what were a surreal pair of questions, Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei were first asked if they felt overshadowed by the women‚Äôs games which was infinitely more interesting and varied at this stage. (They answered ‚ÄòYes‚Äô) and if this would be their last Worlds event (‚ÄúI dunno‚Äù Lee said, and ‚ÄúI dunno‚Äù the English-shy Lin parroted).

While the Chinese women are always accompanied by a halo of mystery ‚Äî though they‚Äôve not won anything big, even experts are reluctant to name a favourite with top-seeded Akane Yamaguchi, a stubborn competitor, and Sung Ji Hyun (potential roadblock for Saina Nehwal) coming into the Worlds looking good. After a long time, the original prodigy Thai Intanon Ratchanok is said to be looking very solid and fit in training, and could well assert her class once again.

In the best of frames

Sindhu, after Rio, though, has put herself in the best of frames to gather happier memories from Glasgow this time. She never really carried much fat on her muscles, but even the last sliver has been got rid off. She follows the men‚Äôs programme in training, as set out by Indonesian mastermind Mulyo Handoyo. And though her below par hand speed won‚Äôt still guard her against body smashes, she boasts the legs that will compensate in reaching strokes looping far away.

Speed and endurance are what Sindhu‚Äôs game are built on, though she has back-to-back potential opponents who are as tall if not taller than her, in the Korean Hyo Min and Chinese Sun Yu, who could make life trickier for her on a given day. The Olympic silver was one of the best things to happen to PV Sindhu ‚Äî it did just enough to stoke her hunger for success, and it injected a confidence for life that will never go away. Glasgow could script a redemption song, and Sindhu will love telling it her way. Of how ‚Äúsome Indian girl‚Äù saw the big prize and blew her rivals away.

Who is Lt Col Purohit? How is he linked to Malegaon and other blast cases?,"On September 29, 2008, a bomb concealed in an LML Freedom motorcycle went off opposite the premises of Shakil Goods Transport Company, killing at least seven people and injuring 79 others. Prashant Nadkar/Express Archive On September 29, 2008, a bomb concealed in an LML Freedom motorcycle went off opposite the premises of Shakil Goods Transport Company, killing at least seven people and injuring 79 others. Prashant Nadkar/Express Archive

After nine years in prison, Lt Col Shrikant Purohit got conditional bail from the Supreme Court on Monday. Purohit, along with Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, were among the key accused in the 2008 Malegaon bombing case, in which seven people were killed.

Within a month of the arrests of Purohit and Thakur, Hemant Karkare, head of the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), which was investigating the Malegaon attack, was killed by Pakistani terrorists in Mumbai on 26/11, throwing the probe out of gear. The alleged involvement of several rightwing extremists resulted in the case turning intensely political ‚Äî with the then union Home Secretary R K Singh releasing a list of suspects who were associated with the RSS, the BJP‚Äôs parent organisation. Singh is now the BJP MP from Arrah in Bihar.

What was Lt Col Purohit‚Äôs alleged role in the 2008 Malegaon blasts?

On September 29, 2008, a bomb concealed in an LML Freedom motorcycle went off opposite the premises of Shakil Goods Transport Company, killing at least seven people and injuring 79 others. Following initial investigation, the Maharashtra ATS arrested Pragya, Purohit and retired Maj. Ramesh Upadhyay. Purohit, perhaps the first serving officer to have been arrested in a case of this kind, claimed at the time that he had infiltrated the Pune-based rightwing group Abhinav Bharat as an intelligence operative, and had kept his seniors in the loop.

Purohit was chargesheeted by the Maharashtra ATS in 2009 and by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in May 2016. In its chargesheet, which absolved Sadhvi Pragya for lack of evidence, the NIA said, ‚ÄúPurohit had proposed theory for a separate constitution for Hindu Rashtra with separate flag (Bhagwa flag) the constitution of Abhinav Bharat, and discussed about the formation of Central Hindu Government (Aryawart) against the Indian government and put forth concept of forming this government in exile in Israel and Thailand.‚Äù

The chargesheet also said, ‚ÄúIt was also discussed (during a meeting in Faridabad on January 26, 2008) that they will eliminate the persons who oppose their ideologies‚Ä¶‚Äù The NIA recorded the statements of seven Military Intelligence officers who said they were not aware of Purohit‚Äôs alleged undercover operation to infiltrate Abhinav Bharat, the group that Purohit registered in 2006, giving his profession as farmer.

Investigators recovered messages allegedly sent by Purohit to Upadhyay, his Abhinav Bharat colleague. He was later accused of diverting Army supplies of RDX, some of which was allegedly used in the Malegaon bomb. As per documents obtained by investigators, and the statements of MI officers recorded by the NIA, Purohit operated independently, without clearance from his bosses. MI is not mandated to infiltrate civilian groups in non-conflict zones, and there was no sanction from the government or any of its agencies to infiltrate Abhinav Bharat or similar rightwing groups.

Is there a link between the 2008 Malegaon attack and the Samjhauta Express and Ajmer Dargah bombings of 2007, which too have been blamed on rightwing Hindu extremists?

The Samjhauta bombings killed 68 people, mostly Pakistanis, as the train was on its way to Lahore. Suspecting a larger conspiracy, the UPA government clubbed all blasts cases allegedly involving rightwing extremists, and asked the NIA to investigate in 2011. The agency filed a chargesheet against five alleged rightwing extremists in the train blasts case. Purohit was not among them.

The NIA approached the Supreme Court seeking Purohit‚Äôs custodial interrogation, not just in connection with the 2008 Malegaon blast, but also to investigate his possible role in the Samjhauta, Ajmer and Malegaon 2006 attacks. However, after a protracted legal battle, the apex court rejected NIA‚Äôs plea for custody.

Two key accused, Sandeep Dange and Ramji Kalsangra, who are suspected to be the key to the jigsaw, couldn‚Äôt be arrested. A red corner notice was issued and a reward of Rs 10 lakh was announced for each man.

The Ajmer Dargah blast of October 2007 killed 3 persons and injured 15. A local court earlier this year acquitted Swami Aseemanand and six others, while holding three RSS workers including Sunil Joshi, who was shot dead in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, in December 2007, guilty. While there are no direct links between Purohit and the Ajmer blast convicts, investigators suspect he knew Kalsangra and Dange, who were close associates of Joshi.

The NIA has said that the long gap between the incidents and the handing over of the cases to it has made it difficult to check fully the evidence collected by the agencies that had carried out the investigations earlier.

"17,000 displaced returned to Mosul in past two months: Iraq","Displaced Iraqis from Talafar are seen in Salamya camp, east of Mosul, Iraq August 6, 2017. Picture taken August 6, 2017. REUTERS/Khalid Al-Mousily Displaced Iraqis from Talafar are seen in Salamya camp, east of Mosul, Iraq August 6, 2017. Picture taken August 6, 2017. REUTERS/Khalid Al-Mousily

A total of 17,000 Iraqi displaced people have returned to their homes in the eastern part of Mosul in the past two months, government officials said. Iraq‚Äôs Minister of Displacement and Migration Jassim al-Jaaf said on Saturday that some 17,000 people returned to their homes in the districts of al-Hamdaniya, Bashiqa, Bartella and Nimrud, all east of Mosul, Efe news agency reported.

‚ÄúMost of the basic services have been restored in the eastern part of Mosul, where 90 per cent of the neighbourhoods already have electricity, compared with only 30 to 40 per cent of areas in the western part,‚Äù Hussam al-Din al-Abar, a council member of Nineveh, said.

Al-Jaaf pointed out that although such figures of IDPs returning to Mosul were not very significant compared with those who were forced to leave their homes; it was a ‚Äúgood start‚Äù to encourage the ministry to offer aid to increase the number of citizens returning home.

The International Organization for Migration said on July 14 that clashes between the armed forces and extremists forced more than one million people to flee their homes during the nearly nine-month offensive, which led to liberating the Iraqi city in July. A large number of IDPs, who fled fighting in the western part of Mosul, are currently in the eastern sector of the Iraqi city, which was the main bastion of the Islamic State terrorist group in the Arab county since June 2014.

Indian-origin boy Rahul wins UK Child Genius show with IQ higher than Einstein and Hawking,"In the final, Rahul impressed with knowledge of his chosen subject ‚Äì Edward Jenner‚Äôs medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England.

(Source: Channel 4 via twitter)

A 12-year-old Indian-origin boy, believed to be having an IQ higher than Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, has been crowned as the UK‚Äôs ‚ÄòChild Genius‚Äô in a popular television quiz competition. Rahul Doshi, who a few days a back became an overnight sensation after answering all questions correctly in some of the earlier rounds, won the Channel 4 show ‚ÄòChild Genius‚Äô by beating his nine-year-old opponent Ronan 10-4 in the programme‚Äôs finale last night.

The schoolboy from north London clinched the title by answering a question on 19th Century artists William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt sink in straight away, but it was really nice,‚Äù Rahul said after winning the title.

In the final, Rahul impressed with knowledge of his chosen subject ‚Äì Edward Jenner‚Äôs medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England. ‚ÄúI was bursting with pride,‚Äù said his father Minesh, an IT manager who had entered his son into the competition.

The final followed an intense competition ‚Äì aired through the week ‚Äì which saw the candidates showing off their maths, English, spelling and history skills as well as memory powers. Rahul had been one of the favourites throughout, after scoring very highly in previous rounds ‚Äì and even bagging a full house in the very first round of the series.

Rahul is all of us and our obsession with @richardosman. #ChildGenius pic.twitter.com/f4krdaNeZu ‚Äî Channel 4 (@Channel4) August 14, 2017

He had captured the imagination of audiences during the competition after he correctly memorised the order of a pack of cards. Rahul, whose ambition is to become a financial adviser, had revealed his strategy for the final as: ‚ÄúThe key is to block out everything else and remain calm. So just focus on your goal. Mine was to answer as many questions as I could correctly and that helped me stay calm and do quite well in the early stages.‚Äù

Rahul has an IQ of 162, which is believed to be higher than the likes of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, and qualifies him to be a member of Mensa club ‚Äì the largest and oldest high IQ society in the world. He was cheered on by father Minesh and pharmacist mother Komal during the show. His father attracted some social media fury for laughing at a wrong answer given by his son‚Äôs closest rival, Ronan, in a tense finale.

‚Äú#ChildGenius an adult laughing at a children getting a question wrong shocking behaviour. Shame on you Rahul‚Äôs father,‚Äù read one of the comments on Twitter. But Minesh Doshi had been very vocal about his competitive side throughout the competition. He had previously said: ‚ÄúWe are here to win. There‚Äôs no two ways about that.‚Äù Twenty contestants aged eight to 12 were whittled down to one winner over the course of a week as part of the ‚ÄòChild Genius‚Äô 2017 series.

Jim Mattis arrives in Iraq for unannounced visit to meet Iraqi leaders,"Mattis has warned that the end of the militant group is far from close. (Source: AP Photo) Mattis has warned that the end of the militant group is far from close. (Source: AP Photo)

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis arrived in Iraq on Tuesday, just days after the start of an offensive to take back the city of Tal Afar, to speak with Iraqi leaders about the next steps in the fight against Islamic State. Mattis has warned that the end of the militant group is far from close. Iraqi security forces launched an offensive to take back the city of Tal Afar on Sunday, their latest objective in the U.S.-backed campaign to defeat Islamic State militants, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said.

A long-time stronghold of hardline Sunni Muslim insurgents, Tal Afar, 80 km (50 miles) west of Mosul in Iraq‚Äôs far north, has experienced cycles of sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shi‚Äôite Muslims. ‚ÄúISIS‚Äô days are certainly numbered, but it is not over yet and it is not going to be over anytime soon,‚Äù Mattis told reporters in Amman. Mattis said that after retaking Tal Afar, Iraqi forces would move against the western Euphrates river valley. He added that Iraqi security forces were capable of carrying out simultaneous operations.

Brett McGurk, the U.S. special envoy to the coalition against Islamic State, told reporters that while the battle for Tal Afar would be difficult, Iraqi forces had retaken 235 square kilometers (90.7 miles) in the first 24 hours. U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mattis, who will meet Abadi and Defense Minister Arfan al-Hayali, would discuss the future of U.S. forces in Iraq after the fall of the remaining cities under Islamic State and the role they could play in stabilizing operations. The officials said that while major cities like Mosul have been largely been cleared of Islamic State militants, there were concerns about the ability of Iraqi forces to hold territory.

Mattis said pockets of resistance remained in west Mosul, including sleeper cells, and attention would be turned after they were cleared. ‚ÄúIt is not going to happen overnight‚Ä¶it is going to be a heavy lift for them going forward, but the proper governance would involve local representation in their day to day lives,‚Äù Mattis said. Islamic State is also on the back foot in Syria, where Kurdish and Arab militias backed by a U.S.-led coalition have captured swathes of its territory in the north and are assaulting its former Syrian ‚Äúcapital‚Äù of Raqqa.

McGurk said that about 2,000 Islamic State fighters remained in Raqqa and as much as 60 percent of the city had been retaken. The jihadist group is now falling back deeper into the Euphrates valley region of eastern Syria. Mattis added that the next step for forces fighting Islamic State in Syria would be to move against the middle Euphrates valley, in a reference to the militants‚Äô stronghold in Deir al-Zor province southeast of Raqqa.

KURDISH REFERENDUM

Iraq‚Äôs Kurds have said they will have a referendum on independence on Sept. 25 despite concerns from Iraq‚Äôs neighbors who have Kurdish minorities within their borders, and a U.S. request to postpone it. However, a senior Kurdish official said Iraq‚Äôs Kurds may consider the possibility of postponing the referendum in return for financial and political concessions from the central government in Baghdad. McGurk said the Kurdish delegation‚Äôs recent visit to Baghdad was encouraging.

A U.S. official said Mattis would press Massoud Barzani, president of the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), to call off the referendum. The Pentagon signed an agreement with Peshmerga forces last year to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and equipment. The U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the memorandum of understanding would expire soon and suggested that Mattis could use it as a bargaining chip.

The United States and other Western nations fear the vote could ignite a fresh conflict with Baghdad and possibly neighboring countries, diverting attention from the ongoing war against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

"Government planning commercial development at Metro car depot, says Congress","Sanjay Nirupam (File Photo) Sanjay Nirupam (File Photo)

Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam on Tuesday alleged that the BJP-led Maharashtra government was misleading the people regarding commercial development on the land meant for a Metro car depot in Aarey Milk Colony in north Mumbai. The government, late in the evening, denied Nirupam‚Äôs allegations, asserting that there would be no commercial development at all on the 30 hectares of land earmarked for Metro car depot. ‚ÄúThe advertisement issued by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRCL) on August 21 claimed that no real estate development is proposed in the Metro car depot. But MMRCL‚Äôs own documents clearly state that 3,000 sq meters of land is going to be used for commercial and residential purpose. It is clearly a misleading statement by the MMRCL,‚Äù Nirupam said.

A decision about commercial development on the land could not have been taken without Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis‚Äô permission, he alleged.

While Metro car depots in other cities did not require more than 18 hectares of land, the MMRCL advertisement said that the government had handed over 30 hectares of land for the car depot, Nirupam claimed.

The commercial exploitation on surplus land will be worth thousands of crores of rupees, but the state government did not disclose this, the Congress leader alleged.

Nirupam also questioned why the government did not opt for sites in Kanjurmarg or the Mahalaxmi Racecourse for the car depot.

He refuted MMRCL‚Äôs claim that the land belongs to the Dairy Development Department and is not a forest land. ‚ÄúThe land belongs to Revenue and Forest Department and Dairy Development Board is only a custodian,‚Äù he said.

Environmental activists have been opposing the proposed Metro car depot in Aarey Colony, as it would necessitate cutting of trees in this leafy area.

Late in the evening, the chief minister‚Äôs office denied Nirupam‚Äôs claims.

The entire 30 hectares of land would be used for Metro work alone, the CMO satement said.

‚ÄúOf the 30 hectares of land, five hectarte is going to be a green patch‚Ä¶.Rest will be used for the construction of car depot,‚Äù it said.

A large-sized car depot was needed as eventually there would be as many as 55 Metro trains running on the 33.5 km long Metro-3 stretch, it said.

As to the ownership of the land, the CMO said the Forest and Revenue Department had stated in an affidavit before the National Green Tribunal that it does not own the land in Aarey Colony.

He settled in New York in the early 1980s, choosing not to return to Poland after its communist authorities imposed martial law.

He did return to Warsaw after the 1989 ouster of communist rule. Actress Olena Leonenko-Glowacka said Glowacki died Saturday.

Triple talaq: From Shah Bano to Shayara Bano,"Muslims are demanding a repeat of Shah Bano case after SC verdict on triple talaq. Muslims are demanding a repeat of Shah Bano case after SC verdict on triple talaq.

The Supreme Court avenged itself this morning, 32 years after former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi overturned its 1985 verdict which had given 62-year-old Shah Bano the right to alimony from her husband, who had thrown her out after living with her for several decades and siring five children.

Much is being made of the five-judge bench ‚Äì all men, of course ‚Äì of different faiths who delivered a stunning 3-2 verdict, declaring ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù the common enough Indian Islamic practice of ‚Äútalaq-e-biddat,‚Äù or instantaneous triple talaq. In this heretical and distorted version of the faith which finds no place in the holy Quran, a man who utters the word ‚Äútalaq‚Äô three times is deemed to have declared his marriage to a Muslim woman null and void.

Several men have been known to do this over Whatsapp and Skype as well, while others prefer the relative intimacy and familiarity of the telephone line. No matter. Several imams, including the one in Kashipur tehsil in Uttarakhand near where the main plaintiff Shayara Bano (along with four other women) lives with her parents ‚Äì his name is Ataur Rehman ‚Äì had the following to say, in April last year, when the ‚ÄòIndian Express‚Äô asked him why he was supporting Shayara‚Äôs husband who wrote out ‚Äútalaq, talaq, talaq‚Äù on a piece of paper and handed it over to her :

‚ÄúThe best way of giving talaq is for a Muslim man to utter it once, give the woman some time to mend her ways, utter it again, give her some more time, before making the third and final utterance. However, even if it is uttered thrice in one go, it is valid. Kami auraton ki bhi hoti hai. Bina wajah koi aadmi talaq nahi deta (Women are also at fault. No man gives talaq without a reason),‚Äù Ataur Rehman said.

Read | What happens to us, ask recent triple talaq victims

The media is also celebrating the fact that each of the five judges who delivered the judgement belongs to a different faith, as if this is an ‚ÄúAmar, Akbar, Anthony‚Äù moment. As if the fact that Justices J S Khehar is Sikh, Kurian Joseph is Syrian Christian, Uday Umesh Lalit is Hindu, Rohinton Fali Nariman is Parsi and Abdul Nazeer is Muslim, has anything to do with the fact that the Constitution is above all religions and guarantees to each of its citizens the right to life and liberty.

Certainly, the views of Justices Kurian Joseph, Rohinton Nariman and UU Lalit were more pathbreaking than the other two as they asserted, ‚Äútriple talaq may be a permissible practice but it is retrograde and unworthy. Since triple talaq is instant it is irrevocable and the marital tie gets broken, it violates the right to equality.

They added, ‚Äúwhat is sinful under religion cannot be valid under law.‚Äù

While Justices Khehar and Abdul Nazeer, leaning towards caution, agreed that triple talaq may be ‚Äúsinful‚Äù but it wasn‚Äôt the court‚Äôs business to interfere in personal laws which were protected under the Constitution. They wanted Parliament to legislate and not leave it to the courts to sort out the matter.

But Justice Kurian Joseph was having none of it. Disagreeing with the chief justice he pointed out, ‚ÄúThere cannot be any Constitutional protection to such a practice.‚Äù

Read | SC says triple talaq invalid, govt welcomes verdict; Muslim leaders say will be difficult to implement

The comments by both Justices Khehar and Nazeer brought back uncomfortable memories of that other Parliament in 1986 which, indeed, did legislate on the matter of the Muslim Women‚Äôs Bill ‚Äì but instead of supporting and validating the Supreme Court‚Äôs verdict the year before, Rajiv Gandhi used his monstrous majority in the Lok Sabha to overturn a perfectly fair and righteous judgement and declare it invalid.

The country was consumed by the debate. On one side was the fresh-faced Rajiv Gandhi, catapulted to the throne after his mother‚Äôs assassination two years ago, who had promised to drag India into the Age of Modernity, the ‚Äúcomputer age.‚Äù On the other side were the old-fashioned imams and Muslim theologians who insisted that Shah Bano had no right to her husband‚Äôs alimony, if he did not deem it so. That she must return to her even older parents, and after them god forbid, to the local wakf for maintenance.

There was no question what side Rajiv Gandhi, that golden boy, would choose.

Much after he had walked across to the dark side, we were told that Rajiv Gandhi had been badly advised. He had been told that the Congress party ‚Äúwould lose the Muslim vote,‚Äù and that he should not listen to the wilful entreaties of those who lived within the Delhi Beltway circumscribed by Sujan Singh Park, Amrita Shergil Road and Safdarjung Road (10, Janpath came much later).

The facts were clear enough. Mohammed Ahmed Khan, a reasonably wealthy advocate in Indore, had married Shah Bano in 1932 ‚Äì around the time the third British government-brokered Round Table Conference had taken place in London, on the advice of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, to discuss the growing demand for ‚Äúswaraj‚Äù or self rule.

After 14 years of living with her and five children, i.e. in 1946, Ahmed Khan took another younger and presumably more beautiful woman as his second wife. The Second World War was over and India was convulsed in the fires of the freedom struggle. After several years of living with both of them, he threw out 62-year-old Shah Bano in 1978, saying that he couldn‚Äôt afford to pay her monthly maintenance of Rs 200.

Shah Bano went to court. The Supreme Court ruled in her favour in 1985. Rajiv Gandhi didn‚Äôt have the nerve to stand up to the pragmatists and the realists who advised caution. He should have listened to his heart, to his soul, to his modernist inclination.

Arif Mohammed Khan, then a card-carrying member of the Congress party, refused to follow Rajiv‚Äôs diktat. Again and again, he advised against capitulating to the mullahs. Arif would turn out to be right in the years that followed. In 1987, the year after Shah Bano, Rajiv Gandhi would order that the locks on the Babri Masjid be opened. By then he would be embroiled in the Bofors bribery allegations. In 1989, the golden boy would lose the elections to VP Singh. In 1992, the Babri Masjid would be demolished.

The Shah Bano case would go down in history as the case that caused the great unraveling. No other Gandhi has since come to power. The BJP has since gone from strength to strength ‚Äì as president of the party, LK Advani would take the number of seats in the Lok Sabha from two in 1984 to 88 in 1992.

All politics is about capturing that moment in history; all history is about politics, anyway. So when prime minister Narendra Modi realized that Muslim women were chafing under the burden of both illogical convention and patriarchal fatwa, he decided he would hitch his bandwagon to the journey. The irony of the BJP drawing out the souls of Muslim women, while ‚Äúgau-rakshaks‚Äù attack Muslim men on the suspicion of carrying beef is the stuff of a Kafka novel.

Meanwhile Shayara Bano, a young sociology graduate and the eldest of four siblings, was married off to Rizwan, a property broker in Allahabad. She was forced to undergo several abortions because Rizwan wouldn‚Äôt get a vasectomy or tubectomy, because he believed they were ‚Äúharam.‚Äù He refused to let her meet her sister. He denies beating her but soon enough he asked her father to come and take her home. The triple talaq arrived soon, in a letter.

Shayara Bano went to the Supreme Court, along with four other women. They insist they aren‚Äôt challenging the Quran‚Äôs admissible right to divorce over 90 days, just this particularly heinous ‚Äútalaq-e-biddat.‚Äù

From Shah Bano to Shayara Bano, its been a long journey for Indian Muslim women challenging governments to uphold their rights to life and liberty under the Constitution. Today is a day to celebrate one stop on that journey.

PM Narendra Modi urges corporates to gift khadi coupons on Diwali,"‚ÄúI am not saying you should compromise on quality, but we need to create an atmosphere for helping the poor,‚Äù Modi said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today exhorted corporates to gift khadi coupons during Diwali as it would greatly help the poor. This gesture on the part of corporates, Modi said, will create an atmosphere that will encourage people to take care of the poor. The prime minister was addressing CEOs at the ‚ÄòChampions of Change ‚Äì Transforming India through G2B partnership‚Äô initiative organised by the Niti Aayog.

‚ÄúYou people give coupons for purchasing of goods, why can‚Äôt you give khadi coupons? Why can‚Äôt you give khadi gifts this Diwali? I am not saying people will start wearing khadi after receiving the gifts. If you have 50 kinds of fabric, there can be one of khadi also,‚Äù the prime minister stressed.

He laid a big pitch for creating an atmosphere for helping the poor. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ we should do at least one activity that can help in addressing the problem of poverty. We need to address poverty in a positive manner. You will see change will happen on its own. I am not saying you should compromise on quality, but we need to create an atmosphere for helping the poor,‚Äù Modi said.

In the past, the prime minister urged Indians to embrace the indigenous fabric khadi through various platforms, including his radio programme Mann Ki Baat. The sale of khadi products jumped 35 per cent in 2016-17.

Why Scams are Here to Say: Understanding Political Corruption in India

Author: N Ram

Publisher: Aleph Book Company

202 pages

Following demonetisation 2016, there has been heightened public interest in the black economy and corruption in India. The public thinks of scams as the big cases of corruption involving the high and mighty political and business leaders. The book under review largely analyses this linkage in both theoretical terms and with reference to some specific cases. The definitional aspects, links with media and the executive are explored.

The book comprises three sections divided into eight chapters. There is an introduction and a long conclusion where the author discusses what can be done. Section I, consisting of three chapters, presents the ‚Äústory of corruption in India‚Äù. Section II provides the context by focussing on ‚Äúhistorical, conceptual and theoretical issues‚Äù. Chapter 6 presents the author‚Äôs understanding, based on the Marxist view of political corruption, which is seen as an alternative to mainstream approaches. He critiques the ‚Äúoverly simplified moral‚Äù view underlying the ‚Äúfailed‚Äù JP and Anna Hazare movements.

Section III presents two important case studies which the author had directly dealt with, which give insights into the links between scams and politics in India. These two scams are Bofors and J Jayalaithaa‚Äôs disproportionate assets case. He hypothesises that ‚Äúseveral Indian states have their own corruption systems‚Äù. So, there is a need for focussed empirical research to help find ways to combat corruption. The author states that the problem has become intractable without a change in India‚Äôs political economy. In the conclusion, he nonetheless presents suggestions under nine broad headings ‚Äî ‚Äúlaws, enforcement capacity, policies, institutions, regulation, vigilance, corporate sector, journalism and politics‚Äù.

The author describes the ‚Äúgrand corruption that operates year-round with clockwork, ‚Äúscientific precision.‚Äù However, this is true of most black income generation (and not just big corruption) and that is why in the literature it has been called ‚Äúsystemic and systematic‚Äù. The book points out that it is the joint product of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen. In the literature, it has been called the ‚Äútriad‚Äù and dismantling it is crucial to tackling black economy and corruption. This requires accountability, especially of the political class. While RTI can help in this, it is the public that has to act by not electing the corrupt. But, the public often has little choice since political parties put up the corrupt and the criminal in the belief that they can deliver.

In Chapter 3 and the conclusion, flawed laws and their weak enforcement are discussed. The author veers to the view that the government is overburdened compared to other countries. But, laws are laws in letter and spirit. If the spirit is weak, then howsoever good a law maybe, it can be circumvented by clever people to their advantage. That has been India‚Äôs experience, whether we think of the anti-defection laws, election financing law or the Income Tax Act.

The book misses the impact of corruption/scams on society ‚Äî it leads to policy failure and to inefficiencies, which lower the rate of growth of the economy below its potential. In addition, it results in ‚Äúsocial waste‚Äù so that welfare associated with growth diminishes. Consequently, even when incomes rise, poverty does not decline and inequality rises.

The book presents the historical context of corruption in India and mentions the idea of ‚ÄúAsiatic Corruption‚Äù. The author points out that the real scandal of the Empire was the loot of India and that was the bigger corruption. The idea that India was a corrupt country before British rule needs to be revisited. Corruption needs to be defined in relation to the laws of the land. If paying money to state officials for work to be done is customary or when the empire of a vanquished king is usurped by the victor, can it be called corruption? There is a fine line between legality and illegality, and this line shifts with changes in laws and the social understanding prevailing at that point of time.

In India, if the black economy is taken as a measure of the level of corruption, the size has grown from 4-5 per cent in 1955-56 to the present 62 per cent of GDP. If one extrapolates back, the level of corruption during colonial rule was low largely because most people had little to do with the state, which was small in size. Since the 1950s, the number of major scams in the country has been exploding in both number and the amount of money involved (See my Indian Economy since Independence: Persisting Colonial Disruption).

The book highlights the role of the private sector, especially MNCs (in spite of rules in advanced countries). In conclusion, the author says that ‚Äúit would be irresponsible for citizens to stand aside‚Äù. The implication is clear: movements are crucial to the battle against corruption.

Make India a world leader in field of knowledge: Super 30 founder Anand Kumar,"Anand Kumar, founder of Super 30 Anand Kumar, founder of Super 30

Indian-Americans must contribute more to make India the world leader in the field of knowledge, Super 30 founder Mathematician Anand Kumar has said. ‚ÄúNow, we all should come together to help India achieve its old status of world leader in the field of knowledge,‚Äù he said at the India Day parade at Madison Square Monday in New York.

He said India always has had a rich legacy in the field of education and ‚Äúwe must contribute to see our country world leader in this knowledge era.‚Äù Speaking at the event organised by Federation of Indian Association, Kumar said that it was heartening to see so many members of the Indian community holding important positions in the US in different fields, because of their talent, hard work and passion.

Patna-based Super 30 is an innovative educational program running under the banner of ‚ÄòRamanujan School of Mathematics‚Äô and it provides free coaching along with fooding and lodging to students of underprivileged sections of the society. According to Kumar, Super 30 has completed its 15 years of journey during which it has sent 396 out of 450 candidates to IIT.

Britain calls on EU to move Brexit talks forward,"Britain‚Äôs Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis. Reu Britain‚Äôs Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis. Reu

Brexit minister David Davis called on the European Union on Sunday to relax its position that the two sides must first make progress on a divorce settlement before moving on to discussing future relations. After a slow start to negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union, Britain is pressing for talks to move beyond the divorce to offer companies some assurance of what to expect after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.

This week, the government will issue five new papers to outline proposals for future ties, including how to resolve any future disputes without ‚Äúthe direct jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ)‚Äù, Davis said.

‚ÄúI firmly believe the early round of the negotiations have already demonstrated that many questions around our withdrawal are inextricably linked to our future relationship,‚Äù Davis wrote in the Sunday Times newspaper.

‚ÄúBoth sides need to move swiftly on to discussing our future partnership, and we want that to happen after the European Council in October,‚Äù he wrote, saying the clock was ticking.

EU officials have said there must be ‚Äúsufficient progress‚Äù in the first stage of talks on the rights of expatriates, Britain‚Äôs border with EU member Ireland and a financial settlement before they can consider a future relationship.

That has frustrated British officials, who say that until there has been discussion of future ties, including a new customs arrangement and some way of resolving any future disputes, they cannot solve the Irish border issue or financial settlement, two of the more difficult issues in the talks.

‚ÄúThere are financial obligations on both sides that will not be made void by our exit from the EU,‚Äù Davis wrote. ‚ÄúWe are working to determine what these are ‚Äì and interrogating the basis for the EU‚Äôs position, line by line, as taxpayers would expect us to do.‚Äù

He said the Brexit ministry would ‚Äúadvance our thinking further‚Äù with the new papers next week.

On the role of the ECJ, Davis said Britain‚Äôs proposals would be based on ‚Äúprecedents‚Äù which do not involve the ‚Äúdirect jurisdiction‚Äù of the court, which is hated by many pro-Brexit ministers in the governing Conservative Party.

EU officials say the court should guarantee the rights of EU citizens living or working in Britain after Brexit.

‚ÄúUltimately, the key question here is how we fairly consider and solve disputes for both sides,‚Äù Davis wrote.

Skin care regime for new mothers,"It is very important for new mothers to take care of their skin after pregnancy (Source: File Photo) It is very important for new mothers to take care of their skin after pregnancy (Source: File Photo)

During and after pregnancy, every part of your body needs extra care and attention. Hormonal changes, stretched skin and sweat can sometimes trigger painful skin conditions that may cause discomfort and irritation. Experts suggest these are managed right from the time they appear.

Subhashini N.S., Natural Product Innovations, Research and Development, The Himalaya Drug Company and Hema Divakar, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, share a few common conditions and tips to help keep skin hydrated and moisturised:

Some of the common conditions you may experience during and after pregnancy are acne, rashes, stretch marks and dry skin. It is important to care of them.

* Choose a mild yet effective body butter which has ingredients like cocoa butter, a natural antioxidant that soothes, hydrates and balances the skin.

* Choose a moisturiser with invigorating fragrances of rose, lavender, or jasmine that help relax the mind.

* Body butter helps to replenish and moisturise the skin more effectively than lotions, keeping the skin hydrated for longer.

* Avoid wearing synthetic and rough materials that cause rash and irritation on the skin.

* Avoid using strong soaps, instead use mild, moisturising soap which prevents the post bath dryness.

* During the initial days of breastfeeding, you may experience sore and cracked nipples. Use products with natural ingredients that are especially enriched with virgin coconut oil that helps protect the skin from cracks and fissures.

* Massage your skin daily with oil that is enriched with sesame oil, known for its skin firming properties.

"Shikhar Dhawan scores 11th century, his fastest in ODIs","Shikhar Dhawan scored his 11th ODI century. (Source: Reuters) Shikhar Dhawan scored his 11th ODI century. (Source: Reuters)

After amassing runs in the Test series against Sri Lanka, India opener Shikhar Dhawan continued his fine form in the one-day internationals as well. Dhawan was the man-of-the-series in the three-match Test series in which he scored two centuries in four innings. He began the ODI series the same way as he began the Test series ‚Äî with a hundred. In the first ODI against Sri Lanka at Dambulla, Dhawan scored his 11th century and that too in quick time. The opener took only 71 balls to reach the three-figure mark.

With the 71-ball hundred, Dhawan now has his fastest ODI hundred. He surpassed his previous record of 73 balls where he scored a century against West Indies in Kanpur in 2013. He also has a 80-ball hundred against South Africa in the first match of the 2013 Champions Trophy 2013.

The last time India played Sri Lanka was at The Oval in the 2017 Champions Trophy and Dhawan scored a century in that match as well. Though India lost the game, it was Dhawan‚Äôs second century against Sri Lanka. In his last five innings against the Island Nation, Dhawan has an exceptional record with three centuries.

Dhawan‚Äôs record against Sri Lanka has been phenomenal. In the last five innings, he has scores of 94, 113, 79, 91 and 125. With another century in Dambulla on Sunday, he now has three centuries in last six innings against Sri Lanka.

Trimming the edges: Before and after MCC‚Äôs bat regulation,"PTI Photo PTI Photo

Rule book

In Appendix E under this law, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the custodian of the laws of cricket, instructed that the bat length ‚Äúshall not be more than 38 in/96.5 cm‚Äù. The width ‚Äúshall not exceed 4.25 in/10.8 cm‚Äù. There was no mention about the depth, edges and weight.

When Jayasuriya played

There was little emphasis on the depth and edges. They all played with good pieces of wood alright, but the sweet spot was smaller and middling the ball and timing it well had been essential to get full value of the shots.

Maximum gains

As franchise-based T20 leagues became en vogue, power-hitters began to use bigger bats. David Warner, Chris Gayle, Kieron Pollard and MS Dhoni commonly used bats with 45 mm or more edges, allowing top edges to go over the fence. The depth of Warner‚Äôs bat (Gray Nicolls Kaboom) in limited-overs cricket is usually 85 mm.

ICC shows concern

In February 2015, the ICC thought evaluating the dimensions of the modern bats, with its chief executive David Richardson expressing concern over the balance being shifted in favour of the batsmen. Ponting speaks up Last year, Ricky Ponting called for bat regulation. ‚ÄúThe modern day bats and weight in particular; it‚Äôs just a completely different game,‚Äù he had said.

MCC responds

At the MCC World Cricket Committee meeting in Mumbai last year, the law-making body responded to growing concerns and took its first steps towards limiting bat dimensions. Then in March this year, they restricted the maximum dimensions to 108 mm in width, 67mm in depth with 40 mm edges. The ICC ratified it, saying the restrictions would come into effect from October 1 this year.

The Indian context

It will have negligible effect on Indian batsmen, as Kohli, Rohit, Dhawan, Rahane and KL Rahul are using the bat within the stipulated dimensions. Only Dhoni exceeds the limits in T20s.

"Germany: In Berlin, Graffiti activists turning Nazi symbols into art","A counter demonstration marches in Berlin on Saturday after Police in Berlin have given far-right extremists permission to hold a 500-person strong rally commemorating the death of Adolf Hitler‚Äôs deputy Rudolf Hess in the city‚Äôs western district of Spandau. (AP Photo) A counter demonstration marches in Berlin on Saturday after Police in Berlin have given far-right extremists permission to hold a 500-person strong rally commemorating the death of Adolf Hitler‚Äôs deputy Rudolf Hess in the city‚Äôs western district of Spandau. (AP Photo)

Horrified at the sight of swastikas scrawled on walls, children‚Äôs playgrounds and building sites, a group of graffiti artists in Berlin is transforming the Nazi symbols into colourful artwork such as flowers, cars and animals. The swastika, which was adopted by Adolf Hitler‚Äôs Nazi party, is banned in Germany, where right-wing sentiment has risen due to an influx of more than a million migrants in the last two years.

Ibo Omari, who runs a graffiti shop and ‚ÄòThe Cultural Heirs‚Äô youth club, encourages young people to look out for swastikas in their local area and then creatively paint over them ‚Äì after getting permission from whoever owns the defaced property. ‚ÄúIt was important to spur young people into action and to encourage them to take responsibility so they don‚Äôt just ignorantly walk past such symbols of hatred,‚Äù Omari told Reuters. ‚ÄúIt offends the whole neighbourhood if someone in our midst paints swastikas in a children‚Äôs playground and I take it personally,‚Äù the 37-year-old said, adding that they also wanted to show graffiti had nothing to do with racism.

Omari and ‚ÄòThe Cultural Heirs‚Äô decided the best way to respond was ‚Äúwith humour and love‚Äù so they came up with designs such as rabbits, birds and a Rubik‚Äôs Cube to cover swastikas. Sketching potential designs during a graffiti workshop in Omari‚Äôs shop, 16-year-old Philip Keilholz said he got involved as racism had no place in the cosmopolitan German capital.

‚ÄúWhen tourists come to Berlin and look at a wall and see a swastika, they‚Äôll think: ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs going on here? There are Nazis everywhere!‚Äô And we don‚Äôt want that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAn artistic symbol obviously looks much nicer than an ugly message and then people walk through the city with a smile on their faces,‚Äù he added.

The group has already transformed around 25 swastikas and their ‚ÄòPaintBack‚Äô initiative has been copied by people in other cities including Hamburg, Kiel and Bremen. Omari was shocked into starting the project in 2015 when a man came into his shop to get some cans of spray paint to cover a swastika in a park where he had been playing with his son. Two weeks later Omari heard about swastikas painted in a skate park.

‚ÄúI felt like I was in the wrong film,‚Äù said Omari. ‚ÄúThere has been a shift towards the right in Germany and not just in Germany but in Europe overall ‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs important to nail your colours to the mast.‚Äù

"Our Stories, Their Stories: When an Indian and a Pakistani walk into a coffee shop in a foreign land","These conversations, if they happen, take us out of our comfort zones. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar) These conversations, if they happen, take us out of our comfort zones. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)

Here in Sydney, I have met a lot of Pakistanis. Contrary to what we have been made to believe, we get along well. Why? I think it is because far away from our mulks, the baggage of history seems a bit lighter. We don‚Äôt have to flaunt and feign patriotism by turning against the other. In faraway lands, our patriotism isn‚Äôt defined by hating the other as easily as it is in our respective countries.

It isn‚Äôt a way to counter racism ‚Äî a ‚Äúwhite vs brown‚Äù thing. At least, not yet in my case.

Is it because, mostly, we speak the same language? Maybe, yes. It could also be because we eat the same food. Does it matter when my Pakistani neighbours make kadi pakora they can share with us? I think it does. Sometimes, I think inherently we are the same.

So what defines this ‚Äúsameness‚Äù? Is it a few big things coming together or too many trivial things that are difficult to keep count of? That we use the same cuss words and stock the same masalas in our kitchen cabinets? Or the bigger similarities: we have the same kind of media that fans the same kind of fires amongst us, provoked by politicians who play the same games, on both sides of our borders?

I was returning from Sydney Cricket Ground the other night. My Uber driver happened to be a young man from Karachi. After a few minutes, he opened up and we were talking like old friends. He hadn‚Äôt been to Karachi in eight years, since he arrived in Australia. These years, he says, were a revelation to him. The media back home had poisoned him against Indians, he said, but here he found us Indians to be just like them Pakistanis.

At the end of the ride, I asked him for a favour: to take something of me to Pakistan, when he visits Karachi at the end of this month. He was surprised. What could I be sending? And to whom? Who did I know there? I told him to take dher sara pyaar from this fellow Indian for his friends and family. That we need love between us and he could be that messenger. ‚ÄúSure‚Äù, he said, ‚Äúwe are the same.‚Äù

But, maybe, we are not.

Well, for many of us, our mazhabs are different. But that‚Äôs not it. The problem, Indians have been told, is Pakistan itself. Here, though, if our communities try to mingle with each other, brotherhood does not seem too difficult. But if we get too close, the suspicions surface eventually. ‚ÄúThat Indian fellow, he sent some chicken xacuti and claimed that it is halal meat. But is it really?‚Äù We trust each other and then we don‚Äôt.

Or when it comes to the wars, and Kashmir. Every time you hear that the other side has violated the ceasefire on LoC, try opening a website, any reputed news website, from the other side. You will see the inverse version. The two news reports won‚Äôt have a single thing in common (except, of course, guns firing and people dying).

On Kashmir, the unshakeable belief is that your own country and your own army is doing nothing wrong. The other side is always to blame. But we, mere citizens forced by circumstances in a foreign land, choose to ignore these issues and carry on.

If you make us talk about it, the layers of suspicion and mistrust slowly become evident. The propaganda of generations of politics, narrated by generations of editors, journalists and historians (for each nation writes its own version of history) to generation of uncles and chachas and nanas and dadas, over and over, has been cemented and fixed in our minds.

When a Pakistani colleague and I met over a cup of coffee and tried discussing politics, it was like putting the very basics of my strongly held beliefs to test. The stories they have heard on their side are just as one-sided as ours. Eventually, we realised that we are all reluctantly loitering in the grey areas here.

These conversations, if they happen, take us out of our comfort zones. My friend from Karachi went on: ‚ÄúLook, I understand. You call Muslims invaders. We invaded your land and ruled it for 400 years and when we left, we took away a piece of it and called it Pakistan ‚Äî it is not fair but it happened. Par ab kya? It has been 70 years. Can‚Äôt we move on?‚Äù

I gulped, tried not to look startled and asked myself, how does one prepare for plainspeak like this? This is not Facebook or Twitter. The stakes are much higher than your typically timid and fickle social media timeline that changes loyalties with every hashtag. These are real conversations and we are real people ‚Äî we work, attend meetings, eat lunch together and wish each other on our respective Independence days.

Meanwhile, we realise, yet again, that we aren‚Äôt the same.

The unlearning that we have to do, if we choose to do, is colossal. And with every passing generation, it becomes more difficult. It can happen when we talk to someone from the other side ‚Äî something practically impossible in our respective countries. But, here, in a foreign land, we meet by circumstance and are bound by it. We talk with each other, first because we need to and then because we want to. And, as we talk, we can see ourselves being deconstructed. When that happens, yes, we are the same.

Then, of course, there is the matter of patriotism. If you are patriotic, you can‚Äôt be nice to anyone from the other side. It makes you a traitor. The other day, a woman from Pakistan asked Minister for External Affairs Sushma Swaraj for help on Twitter ‚Äî a visa request to treat her two-year-old son, who needed an urgent bone marrow transplant. Few ‚Äúproud‚Äù Indians, as they generally are, replying to her tweet, asked her why she did not go to China to seek assistance. Some Pakistanis shamed her for ‚Äúbegging‚Äù medical facilities from India. A two-year-old boy is fighting for life and Twitter warriors from India and Pakistan are defining patriotism. So yes, I guess, we are the same.

It does not matter if you are an Indian or a Pakistani who is reading this, because the question for us, aam janta, remains the same. How long will we let our patriotism be defined by hate?

"England vs West Indies: Never saw any aggression from the Windies throughout the three days, says Curtly Ambrose","Curtly Ambrose said that the West Indies side was embarrassing. Curtly Ambrose said that the West Indies side was embarrassing.

Curtly Ambrose labelled the current West Indies side ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù and ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù after their humiliating innings defeat by England in the first Test. England went 1-0 up in the ongoing three-match series courtesy of a mammoth innings and 209-run win as the first day/night Test in Britain ended inside three days at Edgbaston on Saturday.

Amid a welter of depressing statistics for the West Indies, perhaps the worst was that they lost 19 wickets in under a day on Saturday after being made to follow-on.

‚ÄúIn the end it was totally embarrassing,‚Äù West Indies fast-bowling great Ambrose told Monday‚Äôs Daily Mail.

‚ÄúI never saw any aggression from the West Indies players throughout the three days,‚Äù added Ambrose, who took 405 wickets at an outstanding low average of 20.99 in his 98-Test career.

‚ÄúThere was no belief that they could compete, let alone beat England. They seemed to be waiting for England to make mistakes and at this level that is not going to work. ‚ÄúTrust me, it was painful to watch.‚Äù

West Indies have now won just three out of 87 away Tests in the past 20 years excluding matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.

Ambrose said he had tried to stop the slide as a member of the backroom staff but in the end felt it was a ‚Äúwaste of time‚Äù.

‚ÄúI was with the team for two years as bowling coach and we tried to educate them about our heritage,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúI talked about the pride and passion in representing the region and our people.

‚ÄúI could talk to them all day but once they stepped over that rope they were on their own and if they were not prepared to listen, it was simply a waste of time. It does hurt. ‚ÄúAnd it has reached a point where it is very embarrassing.‚Äù

Ambrose was now left hoping the West Indies could compete in the remaining two Tests of the England series at Headingley and Lord‚Äôs as ‚Äúwhat we have seen so far has been pathetic‚Äù.

Meanwhile England great Geoffrey Boycott said the West Indies were the worst Test side he‚Äôd seen during his five decades of involvement in cricket, labelling their plight a ‚Äútragedy‚Äù for the sport.

‚ÄúThis West Indies lot are the worst Test match team I have seen in more than 50 years of watching, playing and commentating on cricket,‚Äù wrote Boycott in his Daily Telegraph column.

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt bat and can‚Äôt bowl.‚Äù

The former England opener, whose career coincided with that of such West Indies stars as Garfield Sobers, Michael Holding and Vivian Richards, added: ‚ÄúI take no pleasure out of saying this as I played against some of the greatest players the world has ever seen wearing the maroon cap of the West Indies.

‚ÄúIt is a cricketing tragedy to see the West Indies like this and there is no gloating over them losing.

‚ÄúIt is just sad to see a once-proud cricket Test team lower than any I have ever seen before.‚Äù

The second Test starts on Friday.

"‚ÄòDon‚Äôt like our rules? Then leave‚Äô, says China newspaper after journal censored","CUP said it complied so that the larger body of its academic and educational materials could remain available in China. CUP said it complied so that the larger body of its academic and educational materials could remain available in China.

The censorship in China of hundreds of academic papers from a prominent journal will have little impact because readership is so small, but if Western institutions don‚Äôt like the way things are done in China they can leave, the state-run Global Times newspaper said in an editorial on Monday. The editorial appeared after news that Cambridge University Press (CUP) had blocked access on its site in China to a list of some 300 papers and book reviews from the China Quarterly that the Chinese government had asked to be removed.

CUP said it complied so that the larger body of its academic and educational materials could remain available in China. But critics argue that the publisher had undermined the principles of academic freedom and independence and lent its name to China‚Äôs censorship efforts. The articles and book reviews touched on subjects deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, including the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, the 1965-75 Cultural Revolution, Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet.

‚ÄúWestern institutions have the freedom to choose. If they don‚Äôt like the Chinese way, they can stop engaging with us,‚Äù said the editorial in the Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid under the Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily newspaper. ‚ÄúIf they think China‚Äôs Internet market is so important that they can‚Äôt miss out, they need to respect Chinese law and adapt to the Chinese way.‚Äù

The Chinese version of the editorial characterised the clash of principles as a ‚Äúcontest of power‚Äù. ‚ÄúTime will tell who‚Äôs right and who‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù it said. News about the decision by CUP, the centuries-old publishing arm of Cambridge University, set off a torrent of criticism including from overseas scholars of Chinese affairs. In an open letter posted on Medium, James A. Millward, a history professor at Georgetown University, said the decision was ‚Äúa craven, shameful and destructive concession to (China‚Äôs) growing censorship regime‚Äù and a violation of academic independence.

‚ÄúThe result is a misleading, neutered simulacrum of China Quarterly for the China market,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThis is not only disrespectful of CUP‚Äôs authors; it demonstrates a repugnant disdain for Chinese readers, for whom CUP apparently deems a watered-down product to be good enough.‚Äù President Xi Jinping has tightened China‚Äôs already strict censorship since coming to power in 2012 as he seeks to cement the Communist Party‚Äôs grip on power.

"Bangladesh tour is an opportunity for us to change our record in subcontinent, says Steve Smith","Steve Smith will lead Australia against Bangladesh. (Source: AP) Steve Smith will lead Australia against Bangladesh. (Source: AP)

Australian skipper Steve Smith has said that upcoming tour to Bangladesh will serve as a platform to improve upon their Asian record and also get accustomed to sub-continental conditions.

Speaking to the media, Smith said, ‚ÄúI think it is going to be a great series. Bangladesh is very good here. I am not picking a favorite. We have to be confident in our skill set and hopefully, we can get our processes right and have a really good series. We‚Äôd certainly like to have done a lot better on the subcontinent that‚Äôs for sure,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúNow it is an opportunity for us to change (our record).

Recalling their last tour to the sub-continent, he said, ‚ÄúI thought we did some things really well in India. We just needed to do it for a little bit longer, and consistently. This is another opportunity to showcase our skills, show what we learned over there and hopefully give our best foot forward.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Steve O‚ÄôKeefe has failed to make the cut despite having a relatively good tour. Commenting on it, Smith said, ‚ÄúIt is unlucky. He did very well in the first test match in India and had some contributions throughout in the other three test matches as well. We just see it as a bit of a time to get us someone new into the group,‚Äù Smith said.

‚ÄúAshton has been around the group for a quite a while now, he‚Äôs worked on his art and he‚Äôs becoming a lot more consistent in what he‚Äôs doing. It‚Äôd be fantastic to see him get an opportunity. It‚Äôs four years until we next go to India which is always a tough tour for us and one that I particularly as captain want to win (at some stage) throughout my tenure.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an opportunity for Ashton to get some experience in these conditions and hopefully improve, with an eye to the next time we go to India as well.‚Äù, he said.

USS John S McCain collides with tanker in Singapore: All you need to know,"The USS John S. McCain is seen docked at Changi naval base after its accident on Monday in Singapore. (AP Photo) The USS John S. McCain is seen docked at Changi naval base after its accident on Monday in Singapore. (AP Photo)

Ten US Navy sailors are missing and five injured after the USS John S McCain collided with a oil tanker early Monday morning, east of Singapore and the Strait of Malacca. This is the second accident involving a ship from the US Navy‚Äôs 7th Fleet, in the Pacific, in two months.

The guided-missile destroyer was on its way to Singapore on a routine port visit when it collided with the 83-meter (600-foot) Alnic MC, an oil and chemical tanker at 5.24 am. Out of the five injured soldiers, four were evacuated by a Singaporean navy helicopter to a hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries, while the fifth did not require further medical attention.

The destroyer sustained damage on its port side but headed to the port on its own. The tanker it collided with, sustained damage to a tank at the front above the waterline. However, none of its crew were injured and there are no reports of any oil spill. The tanker is also making its way to Singapore. According to Reuters, the ship was carrying nearly 12,000 tonnes of oil from Taiwan to Singapore.

‚ÄúSignificant damage to the hull resulted in flooding to nearby compartments, including crew berthing, machinery, and communications rooms. Damage control efforts by the crew halted further flooding,‚Äù said a statement issued by the US Navy.

Rescue operations are in full swing with efforts being put in collectively by US military helicopters as well as Singaporean coast guards and Malaysian navies. In a tweet, Malaysia‚Äôs navy chief Ahmad Kamarulzaman Ahmad Badaruddin said that two ships, as well as aircraft from its navy and air force, were helping with the search for the missing sailors. The Navy said Osprey aircraft and Seahawk helicopters from the USS America were assisting in the search.

President Donald Trump, responding to reporters questions about McCain said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too bad.‚Äù Post strong criticism, taking to Twitter, he said, ‚ÄúThoughts & prayers are w/ our @USNavy sailors aboard the #USSJohnSMcCain where search & rescue efforts are underway.‚Äù

Thoughts & prayers are w/ our @USNavy sailors aboard the #USSJohnSMcCain where search & rescue efforts are underway. http://t.co/DQU0zTRXNU ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2017

The ship is named after US Sen. John McCain‚Äôs father and grandfather, who were both US admirals and is based at the 7th Fleet‚Äôs homeport of Yokosuka, Japan. It was commissioned in 1994 and has a crew of 23 officers, 24 chief petty officers and 291 enlisted sailors, according to the Navy‚Äôs website. The warship is 154 meters (505 feet) in length. The Alnic MC is a 183-meter (600-foot) oil and chemical tanker. McCain said on Twitter that he and his wife, Cindy, are ‚Äúkeeping America‚Äôs sailors aboard the USS John S McCain in our prayers tonight _ appreciate the work of search & rescue crews.‚Äù

There was no immediate explanation for the collision, and the Navy said an investigation would be conducted.

Cindy & I are keeping America‚Äôs sailors aboard the USS John S McCain in our prayers tonight ‚Äì appreciate the work of search & rescue crews http://t.co/jzk9giXbfg ‚Äî John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) August 21, 2017

Australia cancel two-day warm-up in Bangladesh due to poor ground conditions,"Australia‚Äôs, Josh Hazlewood, David Warner, and Matt Renshaw run during a practice session in Dhaka. (Source: AP) Australia‚Äôs, Josh Hazlewood, David Warner, and Matt Renshaw run during a practice session in Dhaka. (Source: AP)

Australian cricket team has cancelled their only warm-up match ahead of the two-Test series against Bangladesh. The visitors were not pleased with the conditions of the ground, according to a AFP report. The two-day fixture was scheduled to start from Tuesday but heavy rain partially flooded part of the ground. The hosts offered other venues but the Australians didn‚Äôt want to change due to security concerns.

‚ÄúThe BCB has been fantastic trying to get us the game. The amount of rain hasn‚Äôt helped,‚Äù Australia coach Darren Lehman told reporters in Dhaka.

‚ÄúWe looked at various facilities around Dhaka. We feel for the people of Bangladesh with the amount of rain they have had. There are a lot of people in this country struggling because of the rain. So the thoughts are with them.‚Äù

Bangladesh‚Äôs disaster agency claimed 115 people have died after heavy showers hit the area last week, leaving one-third of the country flooded. This is Australia‚Äôs first tour of Bangladesh since 2006 and now focus shifts on the series opener which begins next Sunday at Dhaka‚Äôs Sher-e Bangla National Stadium.

Australia were scheduled to tour in 2015 but it was cancelled at the last moment due to security fears after attacks in the country. The 2017 tour went ahead only after the hosts‚Äô board promised beefed-up security.

"South Africa vs India: Traditional Boxing Day, New Year‚Äôs Tests doubtful","India take on South Africa for four Tests, five ODIs and two Twenty20 series. (Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh) India take on South Africa for four Tests, five ODIs and two Twenty20 series. (Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh)

The likelihood of India playing South Africa in the Boxing Day Test or even on New Year‚Äôs looks increasingly bleak due to a packed schedule for the top-ranked India. The Test, originally scheduled to be played at Newlands, looks to be in jeopardy as India won‚Äôt reach South Africa and be comfortable with the conditions by then. This would severely hamper the Boxing Day Test which has been the highlight of South Africa‚Äôs domestic calendar with Cape Town hosting the second Test from January 2.

But considering Sri Lanka‚Äôs tour of India would run till December 24, the chances of India playing anywhere before first week of January looks difficult. As per reports, India will land in South Africa in last week of December to play the four Tests, five ODIs and two T20Is series. They would want to acclimatise with the conditions for at least a week.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt make it make it in time. The Sri Lanka tour ends on December 24. After that we need to give the boys a few days‚Äô rest,‚Äù a board official told ESPNcricinfo. ‚ÄúThe South Africa tour is a big one, so they need to play two warm-up games, so it will take at least 10 days [before the first Test].‚Äù

In India‚Äôs absence, Cricket South Africa are looking at options to stage a one-off Test. Pakistan and Afghanistan are reportedly the two possible options to travel to South Africa but nothing concrete has been set yet.

‚ÄúI had been aware of the fact that they were unlikely to be there for Boxing Day, but for them not to be here for the New Year‚Äôs Day is a major blow to CSA and the fans,‚Äù said Tony Irish, head of South African players association. ‚ÄúTo lose Boxing Day is a big thing, but to lose both of them would be massive hit for the fans.‚Äù

Irish felt India could play a two or three day game ahead of the opening Test to ensure the contest in early January goes ahead but BCCI official said the players could not be pushed.

‚ÄúIf the India Test matches start much after January 2 or 3, there will be a lot of concern about the players‚Äô workload,‚Äù Irish said. ‚ÄúYou really compound the workload issue.‚Äù Irish has raised this concern with CSA. As per the current calendar, as soon as India leave, Australia play a four Test series in South Africa before the players head to India for the IPL. If South Africa do find an alternative for the Boxing Day, they would be playing nine Tests inside two months.

Game of Thrones: Twitterati avenge Viserion by brutally trolling the Night King,"Do you know who is the Night King on Game of Thrones? (Source: Twitter) Do you know who is the Night King on Game of Thrones? (Source: Twitter)

With just one episode left for the latest season to end, Game of Thrones fans can‚Äôt control their excitement and are busy looking for new theories that could help them predict the end. While gossip mills are buzzing with new plot lines every now and then, one question that is haunting most GOT fans is ‚Äúwho is the Night King, and what does he want?‚Äù

Even though people knew that the White Walkers are powerful, the new side of the Night King in the latest episode came as a bolt out of the blue. In Episode 6, as he killed Viserion, the dragon, with his Javelin-style spear throw, the formidable character left most spectators gaping.

People have been spewing angst and hate for the Night King after Daenerys Targaryen lost one of her dragons. In a vengeance move, social media users have been brutally trolling him on Twitter. While some hailed his javelin skills to recommend him for Olympics, others compared him to Baahubali‚Äôs Kattappa. Take a look at some tweets here.

Anyone have the Night King‚Äôs contact info so we can recruit him to throw javelin? #GameOfThrones pic.twitter.com/7uUiEDL1xs ‚Äî U.S. Olympic Team (@TeamUSA) August 21, 2017

Moreover, the last scene, where the White Walkers were seen pulling the dragon with heavy chains has also been scrutinised. People can‚Äôt stop wondering where they got those chains from, and have spilled hilarious jokes about it on the social media networking site. Check out some of them here.

"In kilt and camera ready, desis hope for Indian summer at World Badminton Championship","Scottish badminton maintains its quaint vibe, despite boasting one of the most modern facilities in the sport in the form of the Emirates Arena. Scottish badminton maintains its quaint vibe, despite boasting one of the most modern facilities in the sport in the form of the Emirates Arena.

Hasmat ‚ÄòBob‚Äô Ullah, a 60-year-old volunteer with desi roots and wearing the kilt, lingers around where Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu have just finished their practice sessions and wonders aloud if the Indians at the Badminton World Championships would mind very much if he asked for a picture with them.

A coach with Badminton Scotland, Hasmat celebrated India‚Äôs twin All England crowns, in 1981 (Prakash Padukone) and 2001 (P Gopichand), and now, on the eve of this week-long event, reckons it‚Äôs India‚Äôs time again. He will duly cheer for Sindhu should she stake claim for the world title.

Of Punjabi descent, he settles for calling her ‚ÄúSundhu‚Äù. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs something else, isn‚Äôt it? India has a potential world-beater in badminton, and what more could an amateur player like me ask for? Someone from my country looking like the best in my sport,‚Äù he gushes.

Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei remain at the centre of the buzz, and Carolina Marin might be aiming for her third crown, but it‚Äôs an Indian summer ‚Äî riding on Sindhu, and Kidambi Srikanth in men‚Äôs singles ‚Äî that the desi community, which knows its badminton as intimately as cricket, is excited about.

Cricketers of subcontinental origin are a widely celebrated lot in the UK, but Hasmat believes many more took to badminton naturally, including England‚Äôs European champ Rajeev Ouseph.

Ask him about Badminton, the parish in Gloucestershire where the sport was codified, and the Glasgow-born guffaws, ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs just the English gloating. Badminton village is more famous for its horse trials ‚Äî cross-country and show-jumping. Not our sport. But most of the UK plays shuttle enthusiastically.‚Äù

Scottish badminton maintains its quaint vibe, despite boasting one of the most modern facilities in the sport in the form of the Emirates Arena. And Hasmat rose from the same charming background of ‚Äòshuttle-in-a-kirk (church)‚Äô. ‚ÄúI started off in church halls. Most people in the countryside still play badminton in the church, where the seats are moved to set up a temporary net. Church leagues still exist,‚Äù he says. Hasmat even trained children in churches on the dotted Scottish islands of Orkney and Barra (Outer Hebrides).

Some church halls are so tiny that the back lines run onto the walls or up the door after the four chairs that form the pew are set aside. There‚Äôs obviously no lifting of the shuttle, just flat strokes, given some roofs are as short as 9 feet. These one-court halls are still common in Worcestershire, Starbridge and Staffordshire south of the line, as well as in the central belt of Scotland, where the sport is widely played.

Scotland has gone all out to make this special for their best player, the women‚Äôs singles shuttler Kirsty Gilmour, who lives 15 minutes away from the stadium, and huge hoardings have her alongside the game‚Äôs greatest, Lin Dan. For Hasmat though, it‚Äôs the one chance to cheer for the ‚ÄúIndian girls‚Äù. Don‚Äôt be surprised if bagpipes start playing some desi tunes this coming week as a man with a proud Glaswegian accent cheers for a country he has never visited, but always loved dearly.

‚ÄúOne grandmother of mine was Scottish, she came from the house of McIntyres,‚Äù he says, before adding grimly, ‚ÄúMy maternal grandmother is buried by a railway track somewhere in Jalandhar. She died during the Partition riots.‚Äù

His mother, 87 now, suffers from dementia, and has been getting fits of anxiety these last few days, recalling in bits and spurts those traumatic days right after Independence, before she was whisked away to Glasgow by relatives.

In this eastern Scottish city, she would meet and marry Hasmat‚Äôs father, a door-to-door salesman born to an immigrant, who ran a grocer‚Äôs shop and first headed to the ship-building town in the 1930s. Hasmat is keen on visiting Jalandhar where his parents came from, but claims has been denied a visa to India repeatedly. ‚ÄúMaybe because they think I‚Äôm from Pakistan. My wife, who‚Äôs Malaysian, will get a visa for India in 10 minutes, but not me,‚Äù he smiles wryly. He‚Äôs made peace with the fact that he may never go to India, and is glad that he can at least support talented players from ‚Äúmy first country‚Äù.

So now Hasmat plans to support every Indian playing at the Emirates vociferously, realising badminton could be his only remaining link with a ‚Äúhome‚Äù that remains out of reach. ‚ÄúI automatically picked badminton and hockey in school, and went on to coach several youngsters after finishing my advanced certification,‚Äù he points out, stressing no borders can kill such affinities.

"Bangladesh vs Australia: We are very much unbeatable at home, says Shakib Al Hasan","Bangladesh players during a practice session ahead of the series opener. (Source: Bangladesh Cricket‚Äôs twitter account) Bangladesh players during a practice session ahead of the series opener. (Source: Bangladesh Cricket‚Äôs twitter account)

After Australia‚Äôs two-day warm-up fixture ahead of the two-Test series against Bangladesh was cancelled due to water-logging, focus has now completely shifted to the series opener in Dhaka on Sunday. This is the first time two teams are meeting since Ricky Ponting and Co. toured back in 2006.

The series is expected to be a keenly-contested affair since Bangladesh are very good in home conditions and Australia‚Äôs sub-continent record, since 2011, doesn‚Äôt make a good reading. Bangladesh‚Äôs experienced all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan feels his side have the ability and winning matches has given them belief.

‚ÄúWe knew that we have this ability, and we needed that belief, and we can only get this belief by winning matches,‚Äù the Guardian quoted Shakib.

Bangladesh have enjoyed a good run in the last two years as the side has reached ICC Champions Trophy 2017 semi-final, beat England in a Test at home and beat Sri Lanka in an away fixture.

‚ÄúBut there is no shortage of self-belief at this moment. Now we feel that we are very much unbeatable at home doesn‚Äôt matter who we are playing against. So this is the belief that makes a team a very good team, and a winning team,‚Äù said Shakib.

Shakib, however, is yet to feature in a Test against the Aussies. Shakib is not alone here as none of the members in Bangladesh‚Äôs current Test squad have played Australia in the longest format.

‚ÄúNone of our team members in this squad played Tests against Australia, so it will be very exciting,‚Äù said the all-rounder.

After successfully closing the Lakme Fashion Week on Sunday, it was time to celebrate and party for Bollywood‚Äôs favourite designer Manish Malhotra. The guest list of the after-party had the likes of Shah Rukh Khan and wife Gauri Khan among others. Manish shared a photo on his social media account where he is seen posing with good friend Shah Rukh and his lovely wife Gauri. Seen with them is friend Anu Dewan. ‚Äú#FunTimes with #TheOneAndOnly @iamsrk and the gorgeous girls @gaurikhan and @anudewan5,‚Äù read the caption of the photo.

Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 witnessed many Bollywood stars walk the ramp including Aditya Roy Kapur, Jacqueline Fernandez, Kriti Sanon, Malaika Arora, Dia Mirza, Aditi Rao Hydari and Taapsee Pannu among others.

Before Shah Rukh, it was his daughter Suhana who attended the weekend event My Superdry of the five-day fashion week. She was seen with Ananya Panday, Shanaya Kapoor and Ananya‚Äôs cousin Ahaan Panday. The young brigade stole all the limelight from the seniors of the industry as they looked simple yet elegant at the event.

Shah Rukh and Manish have been friends for a long time now. Earlier in the year, the Raees of Bollywood graced the ramp in a sherwani as he walked at Mijwan 2017 for Manish. There he garnered a lot of praises not only for his dapper looks but also for his speech at the charity event. He spoke on the issue of gender inequality.

On the work front, Shah Rukh is busy shooting for Aanand L Rai‚Äôs next, where he will play the role of a dwarf for the first time. The film also stars Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. Talking about the film, Shah Rukh said that it will highlight the feeling of incompleteness that a differently abled person goes through.

No Fond Return of Love,"Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part. Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part.

Title: Men Without Women

Author: Haruki Murakami

Publishers: Harvill Secker/Penguin Random House

228 pages

‚ÄúLoneliness seeps deep down inside your body, like a red-wine stain on a pastel carpet,‚Äù says the narrator of the titular story of Men Without Women. The men in c‚Äôs heart-rending new book of short stories are all stained ‚Äî be it by loneliness, their deficiencies or the phantom pain from a wonderfully innocent first love. These indelible marks act as a common strand as the author plays through all seven stories, hitting blue notes aplenty along the way.

In the ever-changing world of Murakami‚Äôs writing, there are a few assurances ‚Äî most characters will have musical tastes ranging from Schubert to The Beatles, solace is often found in bars and good food, cats are a shining ray of hope in a universe that rations it out grudgingly. The most important assurance, however, is that happiness and meaning will be hard to find and even harder to keep.

For many characters, the search that ensues is the driving force that pushes their fractured selves forward. Such a quest ‚Äî be it literal as in The Wind Up Bird Chronicles (1997), or metaphorical, as with Kafka on the Shore (2005) ‚Äî is often the only hint of proactivity in an otherwise bland, almost dispassionate, array of protagonists. The latest collection begins with Drive My Car ‚Äî a reference to The Beatles and the story of Kafuku, a middle-aged actor and widower, whose wife had affairs throughout the span of their marriage. Tortured by the knowledge of the affairs, what Kafuku seeks more than anything else is to know why. Such a curiousity is, in Murakami‚Äôs world, a powerful, arbitrary force devoid of a place on any moral scale.

Perhaps, one of the biggest triumphs of the book is the ease with which Murakami indulges in tragicomedy, maneuvering between the two genres effortlessly. In The Independent Organ, the protagonist speaks of successful cosmetic surgeon Dr Tokai. A 52-year-old confirmed bachelor, Tokai is content to remain ‚Äúthe casual number-two lover, a convenient rainy-day boyfriend, a handy partner for a casual fling‚Äù. That is, until, he falls in love with a young, married woman, who eventually ends their affair, leaving the doctor to grapple desperately with a suffocating sense of loss for the very first time. The narrator mocks and empathises with Tokai in equal measure ‚Äî this narrative tone prevaricates between dark and light in stories such as Kino or Yesterday as well.

While a Murakami short story can be seen as a condensed version of his much lengthier novels, earlier collections such as The Elephant Vanishes (1993) seem to wrestle with challenges in form, struggling not to sacrifice pace for form or flair for substance. Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part. This is not to suggest a dearth of experiments, however. Two particularly intriguing tales ‚Äî Scheherazade and Samsa in Love ‚Äî are also among the more fantastical and dream-like. The former falls into the category of works such as Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World (1985), in that key plot elements can be seen as representative of the narrative structure.

The story that best puts the ‚Äúmagical‚Äù in magical realism is Samsa in Love, a play on Franz Kafka‚Äôs The Metamorphosis (1915). Thrust into an ‚Äúill-formed, fragile, ludicrous‚Äù human body, an insect must come to terms with his new physical and metaphysical realities. The narration is languid and almost directionless at points, as it explores Samsa being thrust into the world of human interactions with the arrival of a hunchbacked female locksmith at the house he is in, with little idea of even the concept of lust or romantic interest.

When it comes to a central component in Murakami‚Äôs exploration of loneliness and curiosity, which are, by nature, deeply intertwined with notions of love and lust, a level of indulgence on the part of readers is undoubtedly necessary. Within the Americanophilic, dream-like worlds that the author builds, there is a thin line between the confidently-paced and ‚Äúget to the point already!‚Äù This line tends to be a divisive one, placing most readers firmly in one camp or the other.

Those who find the indulgence to stroll along this narrative path, however, will likely find themselves in a space one character refers to as the ‚Äúunrealness of reality‚Äù. Left adrift here, in the beguiling space where the author thrives, readers will have to find their own way out. A few, if they‚Äôre lucky enough, might chance across a cat or two along the way.

"US, North Korea clash at UN forum over nuclear weapons","U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (R), together with Japan‚Äôs Foreign Minister Taro Kono (L), holds a news conference after their U.S.-Japan Security talks at the State Department in Washington, U.S., August 17, 2017.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

North Korea and the United States clashed at a UN forum on Tuesday over their military intentions towards one another, with Pyongyang‚Äôs envoy declaring it would ‚Äúnever‚Äù put its nuclear deterrent on the negotiating table. Japan, well within reach of North Korea‚Äôs missiles, said the world must maintain pressure on the reclusive country to rein in its nuclear and missile programmes and now was not the time for a resumption of multi-party talks.

North Korea has pursued its weapons programmes in defiance of UN Security Council sanctions and ignored all calls, including from major ally China, to stop, prompting a bellicose exchange of rhetoric between the North and the United States. North Korea justifies its weapons programmes, including its recent threat to fire missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam, by pointing to perceived US hostility, such as military exercises with South Korea this week.

US disarmament ambassador Robert Wood told a UN-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva US President Donald Trump‚Äôs top priority was to protect the United States and its allies against the ‚Äúgrowing threat‚Äù from North Korea and America was ready to use ‚Äúthe full range of capabilities‚Äù at its disposal. The ‚Äúpath to dialogue still remained an option‚Äù for Pyongyang and it had the choice between poverty and belligerence on the one hand and prosperity and acceptance.

North Korea‚Äôs envoy told the same forum the North‚Äôs nuclear deterrent would never be up for negotiation, echoing Pyongyang‚Äôs regular denunciation of US ‚Äúaggression‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe measures taken by the DPRK to strengthen its nuclear deterrence and develop inter-continental rockets is justifiable and a legitimate option for self-defence in the face of such apparent and real threats,‚Äù diplomat Ju Yong Chol told the forum, referring to ‚Äúconstant nuclear threats‚Äù by the United States.

DPRK stands for the North‚Äôs official name, the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea. Regarding joint US-South Korean military exercises that began on Monday, he warned: ‚ÄúThe ongoing military adventure would certainly add gasoline to the fire, driving the current tense situation to further deterioration.‚Äù

Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said pressure must be maintained until the North demonstrated it would give up its nuclear programme. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the time to discuss (the resumption of) six-party talks,‚Äù Kono said, referring to stalled negotiations involving both Koreas, the United States, Russia, China and Japan. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to exert pressure,‚Äù he told reporters.

‚ÄòCRAZY‚Äô TO SHARE TIMELINE

The head of the US military‚Äôs Pacific Command said diplomacy was key. Admiral Harry Harris was in South Korea to observe annual joint military drills with the South Korean military, which the North called a step towards nuclear conflict masterminded by ‚Äúwar maniacs‚Äù. ‚ÄúSo we hope and we work for diplomatic solutions to the challenge presented by Kim Jong Un,‚Äù Harris told reporters at a US air base in Osan, about an hour from Seoul, referring to the North Korean leader.

He said diplomacy was ‚Äúthe most important starting point‚Äù in response to the North‚Äôs threat, when asked what actions by North Korea might trigger a preemptive US strike against it. ‚ÄúAs far as a timeline, it would be crazy for me to share with you those tripwires in advance. If we did that, it would hardly be a military strategy,‚Äù he said.

The United States and South Korea began the long-planned exercises on Monday, called the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which the allies have said are purely defensive. The drills involve tens of thousands of troops as well as computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea.

The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with the North because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Delegations from about 20 countries spoke at the four-hour UN session, including Britain, France, Australia and South Korea, all of which criticised North Korea.

‚ÄúI would like to repeat the appeal to the DPRK to listen to the fact that there is no alternative to stopping the different provocations and to return to dialogue,‚Äù South Korean ambassador Kim Inchul said. ‚ÄúWe have never threatened the DPRK with any attacks and we have never promoted the use of force.‚Äù

"France‚Äôs Emmanuel Macron, seeking to re-shape Europe, heads towards eastern region","Although posted workers make up less than 1 percent of the EU workforce, with many employed in the haulage and construction sectors, the issue has deepened a divide between the poor east and rich west. (File Photo) Although posted workers make up less than 1 percent of the EU workforce, with many employed in the haulage and construction sectors, the issue has deepened a divide between the poor east and rich west. (File Photo)

While Britain toils over its messy divorce with the European Union, France‚Äôs president Emmanuel Macron is embarking on a drive to deepen the economic integration of a bloc he says needs to be more protective of its citizens. The French leader this week embarks on a three-day tour of central and eastern Europe, where he will seek to win backers for his push to tighten labour rules over ‚Äòposted‚Äô workers, a sensitive issue that has exacerbated an east-west rift. Days later, euro zone reforms, defence cooperation and immigration will be in focus when Macron hosts the leaders of Germany, Spain and Italy for talks, as he seeks to enhance France‚Äôs leadership in Europe.

Paris has long complained that central and eastern Europe gains an unfair advantage from the ‚Äúsocial dumping‚Äù of cheap labour, arguing the posting of low-paid workers hurts local jobs and erodes labour protections in higher-wage member states.

Although posted workers make up less than 1 percent of the EU workforce, with many employed in the haulage and construction sectors, the issue has deepened a divide between the poor east and rich west.

Macron will visit Romania, Bulgaria and Austria, where he will also meet the leaders of Czech Republic and Slovakia, but is skipping Hungary and Poland, whose right-wing governments he has accused of spurning the bloc‚Äôs values. An Elysee Palace source said Macron was visiting countries who were ‚Äúthe most attached to their European anchoring‚Äù.

The source dismissed suggestions that Macron is seeking to drive a wedge between central and eastern European countries staunchly opposed to reform and those that see scope for compromise. ‚ÄúThis is not about dividing in order to better rule,‚Äù the source said in a briefing to reporters earlier this month.

DIVISIONS

Macron‚Äôs election win has re-energised the EU‚Äôs Franco-German axis but in Poland and Hungary it has fanned fears of a ‚Äúmulti-speed‚Äù Europe that could mean reduced influence, financial support and economic competitiveness.

The 39-year-old leader will find a sympathetic ear in Austria, which borders four eastern European countries and where the ruling Social Democrats say an influx of workers from the east is weighing on wages. The posted workers directive permits European companies to send employees to other EU states on contracts under which they only have to guarantee the minimum wage of the host country.

Macron has said a European Commission proposal that posted workers‚Äô pay packets should include benefits in line with host country regulations and that their contracts be limited to two years does not go far enough. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic ‚Äî known together as the Visegrad four ‚Äî say the proposals go too far. They argue they should be allowed to compete on lower prices to catch up after decades of communist stagnation.

Estonia, which holds, the EU‚Äôs rotating presidency, is due to table a new proposal in September. Poland has accused Macron of double standards by advocating a closer Europe while seeking to erode competition in the single market. Two sources in the Polish government said it had tried to invite Macron to Warsaw as part of his trip.

‚ÄúBut we didn‚Äôt see much willingness,‚Äù said one of the sources. Poland‚Äôs Deputy Infrastructure Minister Justyna Skrzydlo told Reuters the Warsaw government trusted in the ‚Äúcontinued unity and solidarity of the Central Europe countries‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe believe that Central European states highlight competitiveness in the European economy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are utterly confident that it will endure in the future.‚Äù Other countries have shown signs of being open to compromise and aligning themselves with an eventual new EU proposal.

‚ÄúI am very much interested in regional cooperation within the Visegrad four, but Slovakia‚Äôs vital interest is the EU,‚Äù Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico. Beyond the issue of posted workers, Macron is likely to be on a charm offensive to drum up support for proposed wider reforms to the European Union that include deeper defence cooperation, fiscal harmonisation and a common budget for the euro zone. His advisors say French diplomacy has long neglected central Europe.

‚ÄúHe wants to get started on Europe. The sooner he starts building these relationships, the more political capital he will accumulate to use at a later stage,‚Äù said Teneo Intelligence analyst Antonio Barroso

"I don‚Äôt like the word diet, says fitness expert Yasmin Karachiwala","‚Äù I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.‚Äù ‚Äù I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.‚Äù

Celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala, who has trained the likes of Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt and Katrina Kaif, says she doesn‚Äôt like the word ‚Äúdiet‚Äù.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the word diet. I think we all are smart and making smart food choices is a lifestyle change. I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them,‚Äù Karachiwala told IANS over e-mail. The celebrated fitness trainer, who has been roped in as the official fitness expert for sports and lifestyle brand Skechers, added: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recommend any diet‚Äù. Along with being a popular name in the fitness sector, Karachiwala, who owns a gym ‚Äî Body Image in the suburbs of Mumbai, is also the first BASI certified Pilates instructor in India and established the first Pilates studio.

Pilates is a system of exercises using special apparatus, designed to improve physical strength, flexibility and posture, and enhance mental awareness. Asked how Pilates is more beneficial than other forms of exercise, Karachiwala said: ‚ÄúPilates helps strengthen the core and works the body from the inside out. It helps prevent injuries. I suggest doing it along with any other exercise and see how it makes you perform that exercise even better.‚Äù

Being in the fitness industry for over two decades, Karachiwala has helped Bollywood big-wigs like Deepika, Katrina, Alia, Sonakshi Sinha, Malaika Arora Khan, Zareen Khan and more to achieve the perfect frame.

What‚Äôs the biggest challenge she faces while training a Bollywood personality?

‚ÄúI think to achieve different looks for a specific role is always a good challenge as if giving us an end goal. Challenges are good as it keeps you and your client motivated,‚Äù she said. Asked with whose transformation she was really proud of, Karachiwala replied: ‚ÄúAll my clients work extremely hard. It‚Äôs not easy with their schedules but they are all dedicated to their workouts and I‚Äôm proud of them.‚Äù

It is often said that Bollywood personalities take supplements to modify their body according to their roles in films. What do you have to say to that? Karachiwala replied: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in supplements as such I think naturally. If we eat healthy, our body can get most of its nutrients. Of course, sometimes vegetarians have a problem with protein so then a plant based protein shake is what I would suggest.‚Äù

"India vs Sri Lanka, 1st ODI: Spinners put India in driver‚Äôs seat","Axar Patel returned with figures of 3/34 in 10 overs. (Source: Reuters) Axar Patel returned with figures of 3/34 in 10 overs. (Source: Reuters)

The Virat Kohli-led Indian team continued with their form in Sri Lanka after the bowlers restricted home side for a total of 216 in 43.2 overs. India rode on spinners to push Sri Lanka on backfoot after Yuzvendra Chahal, Axar Patel and Kedar Jadhav shared seven wickets out of the 10. Patel returned with figures of 3/34 in 10 overs.

Earlier, after winning the toss, Kohli opted to bowl first. Sri Lankan openers Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka began the proceedings well for their side as the two compiled an opening stand of 74 runs. Gunathilaka was the first batsman to go back to the pavillion after Chahal scalped him for 35.

But the first breakthrough didn‚Äôt really effect the scoring rate for Upul Tharanga‚Äôs side as Dickwella along with Kusal Mendis notched up a partnership of 65 runs for second wicket. Wicket-keeper batsman Dickwella was the second one to be sent back, and triggered a steady slide for the hosts.

The hosts failed to capitalise on the start they got in Dambulla and lost the plot in middle overs after the spin was introduced from both the ends. They lost wickets regularly and were reeling at 187/8.

Former captain Angelo Mathews though showed some resistance against Indian bowling attack but ran out of batting partners at the other end. Mathews remained unbeaten at 36.

While the spinners did the job for visitors in the middle overs, fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah wrapped up Sri Lankan innings after cleaning up debutant Vishwa Fernando for a duck.

Bombay High Court asks govt to provide National Law University with infrastructure,"Bombay High Court Bombay High Court

The Bombay High Court on Monday directed the state government to provide Maharashtra National Law University with proper infrastructure within two weeks. A division bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice N M Jamdar was hearing a Public Interest Litigation filed by advocate Pradip Havnur that complained that no concrete steps were being taken to hand over the plot to MNLU.

The bench was informed that law university campus lacks in basic amenities such as chairs in the university library. ‚ÄúWe want this institution to produce excellent lawyers and judges, which is definitely not possible with the current situation,‚Äù said the chief justice. She asked the state government the reason for delaying the allotment of land to MNLU.

The state government‚Äôs counsel said that the government is trying everything possible to ensure quality infrastructure to the law university.

Iran to be able to resume high-level uranium enrichment ‚Äòin 5 days‚Äô if US quits nuclear deal,"‚ÄúIf we make a determination, at most in five days we can start 20 per cent enrichment in Fordo (nuclear plant),‚Äù Ali Akbar Salehi said in an interview with state broadcaster IRIB.

(File ‚Äì AP Photo)

Iran can resume high-level uranium enrichment within five days if the United States tears up the nuclear deal, the head of its Atomic Energy Organisation said today. ‚ÄúIf we make a determination, at most in five days we can start 20 per cent enrichment in Fordo (nuclear plant),‚Äù Ali Akbar Salehi said in an interview with state broadcaster IRIB.

‚ÄúOf course we would not like such a thing to happen as we made a lot of effort to achieve the JCPOA (nuclear deal),‚Äù he added.

The 2015 nuclear deal with world powers saw sanctions eased in exchange for curbs to Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme. That included a ban on high-level enrichment of uranium of 20 per cent or more ‚Äì a process which would take Iran close to the level needed for a nuclear weapon.

US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to tear up the nuclear deal during his campaign, and it has come under mounting pressure after Tehran carried out missile tests and Washington imposed new sanctions ‚Äì with each accusing the other of violating the spirit of the agreement.

"Veteran artist Haroon Khimani, 81, to showcase his latest work in Mumbai","Haroon Khimani‚Äôs paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation. Haroon Khimani‚Äôs paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation.

Haroon Khimani might be an octogenarian but it has not lessened his love for art. The 81-year-old ‚Äî who always seeks to discover the beauty of nature, mostly in collapsed structures and disasters, be it natural or man-made ‚Äî will soon showcase his latest contemporary retrospective visual arts exhibition titled ‚ÄòDescent‚Äô in Mumbai. His paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation, steeped into potential energy of rebuilding.

‚ÄúThere is an ethical side to nature which borders between ‚Äòbeing‚Äô and ‚Äònothingness‚Äô. That inspires me the most. For the artist, it is a chance to step inside their own creations, to appear in a visual story and establish an interaction. Creating a super sensual existence on the canvass is an intense personal experience. In my paintings you will see nature acts as a backdrop that determines human fate. Everything is in a flux. Ultimately the desperate elements form a whole and add to the tempo of narrative,‚Äù Khimani said in a statement.

The veteran artist, has earlier stated on his website, ‚ÄúBeauty has a new definition for me. My paintings look like landscapes but there is unusual magnitude of structural juxtaposition, depth, recession and space created by colours perceived through black and white tones. We all are habituated to see beauty in limited terms but in disorganised and chaotic nature new beauty forms are created by self-destruction of the existing structures. Nature does this wonderfully but it depends upon our outlook to see the beauty in it. In fact, at such junctures we are emotionally driven to sympathy towards sufferers and dislocated mass, which leads us to see the pathetic and helpless part of it rather than the aesthetic value.‚Äù

"3 judgments, 3 takeaways","Breaking Through: Women in old Delhi‚Äôs Jama Masjid area on Tuesday afternoon, hours after the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq. Tashi Tobgyal Breaking Through: Women in old Delhi‚Äôs Jama Masjid area on Tuesday afternoon, hours after the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq. Tashi Tobgyal

The constitution Bench of five judges, belonging to five different religious communities, took more than three months to author its 395-page judgment on triple divorce. The historic verdict marks a red-letter day for gender justice in India. However, even judges who held triple divorce unconstitutional based their decision on arbitrariness rather than on the discriminatory nature of triple divorce. Thus, gender justice was not the basis of the majority judgment. The case before the Supreme Court was born out of an unrelated matter regarding the denial of inheritance rights to Hindu women under a 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession Act (Prakash and Ors versus Phulavati and Ors, October 16, 2015). A Hindu woman had won against her brothers in the High Court but lost in the Supreme Court. At the end of the judgment, the Bench of Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel and Anil R Dave ordered that Muslim law too is discriminatory, for which a separate Public Interest Litigation should be initiated.

The current case was filed by Shayara Bano to get triple divorce, polygamy and halala declared unconstitutional. The case had an interesting twist ‚Äî her husband had, prior to giving her triple divorce, filed a case for the restitution of conjugal rights, and it was Shayara who had left her matrimonial home. While Phulavati did not get justice and the property to which she was entitled under the progressive 2005 amendment, Muslim women who are victims of instant triple divorce, have got some relief.

The issues in the case were so complicated that we have as many as three judgments. Chief Justice of India J S Khehar authored one opinion, with which Justice S Abdul Nazeer agreed. The second opinion was authored by Justice Kurian Joseph. The third judgment was written by Justice Rohinton F Nariman on behalf of himself and of Justice Uday U Lalit. Justice Kurian agreed with Justice Khehar on some points, and with Justice Nariman on others. Let us understand the judgments and reasons for the different opinions. All the opinions have clearly stated that they are dealing just with instant triple divorce, and not with other forms of divorces under Muslim Personal Law.

Nariman: Triple divorce is unconstitutional

Justice Nariman has held that instant irrevocable triple talaq not preceded by the efforts at reconciliation is unconstitutional, as it is contrary to the right to equality, which includes the right against arbitrariness. The basis of his decision is the recognition of triple divorce by the Shariat Act, 1937. The Act laid down that in matters of talaq, gift, will, inheritance etc., ‚Äúthe rule of decision where parties are Muslims shall be Muslim Personal Law‚Äù. He quoted the 1932 decision of the Privy Council in which triple divorce was held as valid under Sharia to conclude that since instant triple divorce is ‚Äúmanifestly arbitrary‚Äù, the Shariat Act, to the extent it recognised triple divorce, is ultra vires the Constitution.

He also observed that the duties or obligations of a Muslim can be divided into five categories, viz., Farz, which must be obeyed and Wajib, which is slightly less important; Mustahab, or recommendatory; Jaiz, which is permissible, and to which religion is indifferent; Makruh, or unworthy; and finally, Haram, or forbidden. Instant triple talaq, he said, is either in category 3 (permissible) or, probably, in category 4, which is undesirable.

Since it is not obligatory or recommended, and is rather sinful or undesirable, it cannot meet the ‚Äúessentiality test‚Äù, and is, thus, not protected by Article 25 (freedom of religion). Also, triple talaq, which is irrevocable and is valid under Muslim Personal law even when the husband assigns no reason for his action, is arbitrary, and therefore, unconstitutional, Justice Nariman has said.

He has struck down Section 2 of the Shariat Act, which recognises and enforces triple divorce. All parent laws, subordinate legislation and executive orders are subject to fundamental rights, and must be struck down if they are not compatible. Justice Nariman dissented with the judgment of the CJI on the issue of the judiciary not being the right forum to dispose of such matters. The Supreme Court cannot refuse to decide when approached by a litigant under Article 32 against the violation of his/her fundamental rights, and put the ball in Parliament‚Äôs court, he said.

Khehar: Major milestone on freedom of religion

Justice Khehar‚Äôs judgment is the most detailed ‚Äî 272 pages ‚Äî and a major milestone in the history of freedom of religion in India. For the first time in Indian judicial history, freedom of religion subject to restrictions given in Articles 25 and 26 has been held to be ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù. After quoting Constituent Assembly debates on Articles 25 and 44, the CJI held that personal law is part of the freedom of religion, which courts are duty-bound to protect. He also said courts are not supposed to find fault with provisions of personal law, which are based on beliefs, not logic. Personal law, he said, is beyond judicial scrutiny.

The CJI explicitly said that accepting the petitioner‚Äôs prayer to hold triple talaq unconstitutional would amount to negating freedom of religion. He equated triple divorce to fundamental rights. Disagreeing with Justice Nariman, he observed that since the recognition of Muslim Personal Law by the Shariat Act of 1937 does not give it statutory status, and because Muslim Personal Law is not ‚Äòlaw‚Äô as held by the Supreme Court, the Shariat Act, or triple talaq under it, cannot be held unconstitutional. He also turned down the central government‚Äôs argument citing international conventions, saying such conventions, if they were contrary to fundamental rights, cannot be implemented.

The CJI also refused to strike down triple divorce as violative of public order, health and morality, or for being contrary to other fundamental rights such as the right to equality or the right to live with human dignity. As in the case of sati and the devdasi practice, in triple talaq, too, Parliament should take the lead, keeping in view similar reforms in Muslim countries, he said. Using the Supreme Court‚Äôs extraordinary powers under Article 142, he ordered that no triple talaq will be given for six months. Justice Joseph disagreed with the use of Article 142 in this case.

Joseph: Triple divorce is un-Islamic

The third and most important judgment was delivered by Justice Joseph who fully endorsed the CJI‚Äôs opinion on freedom of religion, thereby ensuring its majority. He agreed with Justice Nariman on triple divorce not being an essential part of Muslim Personal Law. But he disagreed with Justice Nariman on the interpretation of the Shariat Act ‚Äî concurring, rather, with Justice Khehar‚Äôs opinion that the Shariat Act is not a legislation regulating triple divorce.

He held that the purpose of the 1937 Act was to remove un-Islamic and oppressive customs and usages from Muslim Personal Law, and since triple divorce is not mentioned in the Quran, it is not a part of Sharia ‚Äî and thus cannot be enforced under the Shariat Act. What is sinful in theology must be held bad in law as well, Justice Joseph ruled. He also observed that the legislature, while enacting laws on gender justice, must give due weightage to freedom of religion.

"AIADMK factions merge in Tamil Nadu: EPS and OPS are one again, move to purge Sasikala loyalists, all eyes on TTV Dinakaran","Chennai: Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami (R) and O Panneerselvam exchange greetings with supporters following merger of their factions in Chennai on Monday.

Ending a bitter spat that saw them part ways more than six month ago following the death of their leader J Jayalalithaa, the two factions of the AIADMK announced Monday a merger deal under which Edappadi K Palaniswami will remain the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and O Panneerselvam, his predecessor, will be Deputy Chief Minister. K Pandiarajan, a close aide of Panneerselvam, will also be in the cabinet.

The deal, reached after several rounds of negotiations with the blessings of the BJP, will lead to the formal ouster of V K Sasikala as the AIADMK general secretary ‚Äî the close aide of Jayalalithaa is doing time in prison in a disproportionate assets case.

Panneerselvam has been designated coordinator of an 11-member steering committee which will also have three joint coordinators ‚Äî R Vaithilingam, K P Munuswamy and Palaniswami. Vaithilingam said the party will convene a general council meeting to remove Sasikala from the post of general secretary.

The removal of Sasikala and a probe into the death of Jayalalithaa were two key demands of the Panneerselvam faction. But these put at risk the majority that the Palaniswami government enjoys ‚Äî the Sasikala camp, led by her nephew and party deputy general secretary Dinakaran, has the support of at least 23 MLAs including three Independents. Dinakaran has not yet responded to the merger announcement.

According to AIADMK sources, the removal of Sasikala involves legal steps, including a resolution passed by the general council and informing the Election Commission about the merger, the decision to remove interim chief Sasikala, and withdrawing an affidavit filed by the Palaniswami faction which had endorsed the leadership of Sasikala and Dinakaran.

Following the meeting announcing the merger, an official release from Raj Bhavan said Governor C Vidyasagar Rao had accepted the recommendation of the Chief Minister to designate Panneerselvam as Deputy Chief Minister and the induction of Pandiarajan into the council of ministers.

Panneerselvam has been allocated the Finance portfolio which was held by D Jayakumar. His additional charges will include Housing, Rural Housing and Housing Development, Slum Clearance Board and Accommodation Control, Town Planning, Urban Development and Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority.

Pandiarajan has been given charge of Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture. He was also given charge of Archaeology, until now with School Education Minister K A Sengottaiyan.

Addressing party leaders, Panneerselvam said ‚Äúnobody can separate us‚Äù. Reminding all present that they are ‚Äúthe children of Amma‚Äù, he said he decided on a merger considering the sentiments of the party‚Äôs 1.5 crore cadre. He thanked Palaniswami for facilitating the merger.

Palaniswami, in turn, praised Panneerselvam and said AIADMK may be the only party in India that could claim such a merger in spite of many disagreements. He said the united AIADMK will soon retrieve the party symbol, frozen by the Election Commission, and that the party will rule Tamil Nadu for the ‚Äúnext 100 years‚Äù.

Opposition DMK leader M K Stalin said the AIADMK merger was something that was operated by ‚ÄúDelhi‚Äù.

The United Nations says attacks against aid workers are increasing in South Sudan. A statement by the humanitarian coordinator there, Serge Tissot, says the attacks also put millions of South Sudanese in peril amid the country‚Äôs civil war. Millions face severe hunger.

The world‚Äôs youngest nation has become one of the most dangerous places for aid workers to operate. Eighty-two have been killed since 2013, including 15 this year. Many are local workers. The UN says attacks include the looting of warehouses and trucks and the loss of tons of food aid.

The world body has repeatedly asked South Sudan‚Äôs government to better protect aid workers and let them do their jobs without restrictions. Government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny says it is ‚Äúunbecoming‚Äù to think authorities are targeting aid workers.

Lebanon says it helped foil plot to down plane in Australia,"Representational Image Representational Image

Lebanon‚Äôs interior minister said that the country‚Äôs police intelligence played a major role in foiling a plot to bring down an Emirati passenger plane that was supposed to take off from Sydney bound for the United Arab Emirates‚Äô capital, Abu Dhabi.

Nohad Machnouk told reporters on Monday that four Lebanese-Australian brothers, including one who is in detention in Lebanon, had planned to blow up the plane with bombs hidden inside a large Barbie doll and a meat grinder. He said the bombs did not make it onto the plane because the handbag they were placed in was 7 kilograms (15.4 pounds) above the weight permitted by the airline. Machnouk said the bombs were sent back to the would-be attacker‚Äôs home in Australia.

He said the attacker tried to bring two explosives on the plane in case one of them did not work. The second would be detonated by one of the brothers who was supposed to be the suicide attacker. It was not immediately clear how authorities uncovered the plot.

Australian authorities said late last month that they thwarted a credible terrorist plot to down an airplane by smuggling a device onboard. They have provided few details, including the precise nature of the threat or any airlines involved.

The United Arab Emirates‚Äô national airline said it is working with Australian police in the ongoing investigation. But Etihad Airways, the smallest of three long-haul Gulf carriers that fly to Australia, refused to confirm if it had been targeted.

Earlier this month, Australian police said two men were charged with terrorism offenses in Australia in connection with an alleged plot to bring down the airplane. It was not immediately clear if they were two of the four brothers. Four Lebanese-Australian men had been arrested by police, who also reportedly seized a meat grinder that investigators thought may be the basis of a bomb. One of the four was released later without charge.

Machnouk said two of the brothers, Khaled and Mahmoud Khayyat, are held in Australia, while another, Tarek, is a senior member of the Islamic State group based in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa. He added that the fourth brother, Amer, was supposed to be on board the plane, working to bring it down 20 minutes after takeoff, but was arrested in Lebanon after he arrived in mid-July from Australia. ‚ÄúThe operation was foiled because of the extra weight,‚Äù Machnouk said. ‚ÄúIntelligence branch followed on the case and found that Amer was involved in this act and it appears that he was supposed to carry it out.‚Äù

He said that since Tarek Khayyat moved to Raqqa and became in IS commander, Lebanese police intelligence started tracking his brothers. Machnouk said that Amer Khayyat traveled between Australia and Lebanon several times under pretexts such as coming to get engaged or get married. Machnouk said that about 400 passengers were on the plane, including 120 Lebanese. He said the four brothers wanted to punish the UAE and Australia for being part of the US-led coalition that is targeting the extremists.

‚ÄúWhen four Lebanese brothers in Australia decide to blow up an Emirati jet this means that the whole world should work together to fight terrorism,‚Äù Machnouk said. ‚ÄúCoordination should be 24 hours a day between all security agencies to stop such attacks.‚Äù

Ranveer Singh and eccentricity go hand-in-hand.

We still can‚Äôt forget the time when he dressed up as a condom to Shahid Kapoor‚Äôs birthday bash or simply turned up at GQ Awards in a man skirt! Making heads turn once again is Singh in a rainbow coloured sequined jacket from Manish Arora‚Äôs Spring 2017 womenswear collection.

Yes, you heard us right, it was from the designer‚Äôs Cosmic Love collection which he showcased to mark his 10th anniversary on the Parisian catwalk earlier this year. Given the iridescent hues, it‚Äôs not an easy jacket to pull off, but the Padmavati actor took it in his stride and made it his own when he graced the front row at Arora‚Äôs show at the recently concluded Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017.

The way he styled it with a pair of simple black jeans, black brogues and a fedora is commendable. We think it‚Äôs completely star-worthy and we just can‚Äôt stop drooling!

Meanwhile, Jacqueline Fernandez was seen wearing psychedelic prints during the promotion of her upcoming film A Gentleman. The futuristic, sequined pants from Mira Mikati was styled with a plain black tank top from Tunisian fashion designer, Max Azaria‚Äôs label BCBG Max Azria and strappy black heels from Le Mill.

Romanian player George Calintaru breaks finger in anger after failed ‚ÄòPanenka‚Äô,"George Calintaru taking the penalty. (Source: Screengrab) George Calintaru taking the penalty. (Source: Screengrab)

Juventus Bucharest midfielder George Calintaru broke his finger when he punched a table in the dressing room after seeing his stoppage-time ‚ÄòPanenka‚Äô penalty easily saved, that could have earned his newly-promoted club a draw against FCSB in Romania‚Äôs Liga 1 on Saturday.

The 28-year-old missed the penalty in the sixth minute of added time after trying to chip the goalkeeper of FCSB, formerly known as Steaua Bucharest, angering his team mates.

TV footage showed Calintaru being pushed by vice-captain Valentin Barbulescu after the costly miss, which was the final kick of the game. The match ended in a 2-1 home defeat for Juventus, who had Iulian Carabela sent off after 72 minutes.

Local media reported Calintaru had been beaten by team mates after the final whistle but Juventus manager Daniel Oprita described the incident as ‚Äúheated discussion‚Äù.

Oprita, who joined the club in 2015, said after the defeat that he did not want to continue as manager.

Juventus, still searching for their first win of the season, remain bottom of the table with two points from seven matches. Unbeaten FCSB are third on 15.

Scandal-marred USA Gymnastics needs sweeping change: Aly Raisman,"Raisman, who was around Nassar regularly at the team‚Äôs training facility in Texas and at meets around the globe, declined to talk about whether she was treated improperly. (Source: Reuters) Raisman, who was around Nassar regularly at the team‚Äôs training facility in Texas and at meets around the globe, declined to talk about whether she was treated improperly. (Source: Reuters)

Aly Raisman is ready to talk about ‚Äúthe elephant in the room.‚Äù And the six-time Olympic medal-winning gymnast thinks it‚Äôs time USA Gymnastics joins in a conversation she feels is long overdue.

The 23-year-old is calling for sweeping change in the organization in the wake of dozens of allegations of sexual abuse by former national team doctor Larry Nassar, a scandal that has left one of the U.S. Olympic movement‚Äôs marquee programs scrambling and Raisman shaken.

Nassar spent nearly 30 years as an osteopath with the USA Gymnastics program and is now in prison in Michigan after pleading guilty to possession of child pornography. He is awaiting trial on separate criminal sexual conduct charges, in addition to being sued by more than 125 women who claim he sexually assaulted them under the guise of treatment.

Nassar has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, and the dozens of civil suits filed in Michigan are currently in mediation .

Raisman, who was around Nassar regularly at the team‚Äôs training facility in Texas and at meets around the globe, declined to talk about whether she was treated improperly by Nassar. She did agree to speak more generally, calling Nassar ‚Äúa monster‚Äù and blaming USA Gymnastics for failing to stop him and spending too much of the fallout attempting to ‚Äúsweep it under the rug.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel like there‚Äôs a lot of articles about it, but nobody has said, `This is horrible, this is what we‚Äôre doing to change,‚Äù‚Äô Raisman said in a wide-ranging interview Saturday shortly after she and other members of the ‚ÄúFinal Five‚Äù that won team gold at the 2016 Olympics were inducted into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

Raisman served as a captain for both the ‚ÄúFinal Five‚Äù and the ‚ÄúFierce Five‚Äù that won gold in London in 2012. While several alleged Nassar victims have come forward, including 2000 Olympic bronze medalist Jamie Dantzscher, Raisman is the highest profile athlete yet to publicly reprimand the organization. Raisman said she kept quiet waiting after the initial allegations surfaced last summer, waiting for USA Gymnastics to own up to its mistakes.

While it is taking steps toward creating a safer environment for its athletes, she doesn‚Äôt believe it is doing nearly enough openly enough, adding that she feels USA Gymnastics is trying to get on with business as usual.

‚ÄúWhat people don‚Äôt realize is that this doctor was a doctor for 29 years,‚Äù Raisman. ‚ÄúWhether or not he did it to a gymnast, they still knew him. Even if he didn‚Äôt do it to you, it‚Äôs still the trauma and the anxiety of wondering what could have happened. I think that needs to be addressed. These girls, they should be comfortable going to USA Gymnastics and saying: `I need help, I want therapy. I need this.‚Äù‚Äô

USA Gymnastics launched an independent review of its policies in the wake of the allegations against Nassar and reporting by the Indianapolis Star that highlighted chronic mishandling of abuse allegations against coaches and staff at some of its more than 3,500 clubs across the country.

In June, the federation immediately adopted 70 recommendations proffered by Deborah Daniels, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the review. The new guidelines require member gyms to go to authorities immediately, with Daniels suggesting USA Gymnastics consider withholding membership from clubs that decline to do so. The organization also named Toby Stark, a child welfare advocate, as its director of SafeSport. Part of Stark‚Äôs mandate is educating members on rules, educational programs, reporting and adjudication services.

USA Gymnastics said in a statement late Saturday it welcomes Raisman‚Äôs passion, adding it‚Äôs ‚Äúappalled‚Äù by the accusations against Nassar.

‚ÄúWe are taking this issue head-on, and we want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe,‚Äù USA Gymnastics said.

Daniels said repeatedly when her review was published that she wasn‚Äôt hired to make judgments on past missteps, something that doesn‚Äôt fly with Raisman. She pointed to the reported $1 million severance package given to former president Steve Penny after he resigned under pressure in March as proof that the organization just doesn‚Äôt get it.

‚ÄúI thought, `Wow, why couldn‚Äôt they create a program?‚Äù‚Äô Raisman said. ‚ÄúA million dollars is a lot of money. They could do a lot of things to create change. They could create a program. They could even contact all the families that have come forward and say. `Can we help your kid with therapy?‚Äù‚Äô

Lynn Raisman, Aly‚Äôs mother, said USA gymnastics needs to ‚Äúget rid of the people who knew and looked the other way.‚Äù

Raisman has used her celebrity and extensive social media reach as a platform to promote positive body image and anti-bullying. She‚Äôs currently living in Needham, Massachusetts, working on an autobiography due out in November while weighing whether to take a shot at the 2020 Games. Either way, she wants USA Gymnastics to evolve and stressed there‚Äôs a difference between her criticism of USA Gymnastics and the sport as a whole.

The sport is fine. She loves gymnastics. It‚Äôs the parent organization that needs to undergo a transformation. And she‚Äôs clear on the message she wants it to send.

‚ÄúEveryone is important,‚Äù Raisman said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre the Olympic champion or you‚Äôre an 8-year-old that goes to gymnastics in Ohio, or wherever you are in the U.S. Every single kid is important and I want USA Gymnastics to do a better job with that.‚Äù

Sydney Olympic Games gave me belief to win gold: Abhinav Bindra,"Abhinav Bindra was only 17 while competing in Sydney. (Source: PTI) Abhinav Bindra was only 17 while competing in Sydney. (Source: PTI)

Out of the five Olympic Games he has participated in, the Games in Sydney remain his favourite and that is where he believed that one day he can go on to win the gold medal the biggest sport event of the world, shooter Abhinav Bindra revealed on Monday.

Bindra took part in the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games when he was just 17 years old and actually went to win a gold medal eight years later in Beijing Games. The Air-Rifle shooter still remains the first and only individual Olympic gold medallist of the country.

‚ÄúI went to five Olympic Games and my favourite is Sydney. Why I enjoyed the Sydney so much, (it is) because of the people of Australia. For me Sydney Olympics is special, I finished 10th or 11th at those games. My performance at Sydney game me the belief that one day perhaps I can go and win the gold medal (at the Olympics),‚Äù Bindra said here.

Bindra, 34 won the gold in the 10m air rifle event, on Monday also said that Commonwealth Games also have their own importance for an athlete.

‚ÄúThe Commonwealth Games is an important benchmark in the whole career path of an athlete. The three multi-sporting disciplines where we participate in ‚Äì Commonwealth, Asian and Olympic Games. Each one is a stepping stone to building up to the Olympic Games and each one is important. The level, competitions differ event to event, but they all are important.

‚ÄúI won nine medals at the Commonwealth Games but I ended up winning my first individual gold at the last games (2014 Glasgow),‚Äù he said.

Talking about how much time does it take to win a gold medal at Olympics, Bindra said, ‚ÄúIt takes about eight years to develop as an Olympic athlete, very few athletes actually who go there win medal in their first Games.‚Äù

‚Äú10,000 athletes go and compete at an Olympic Games, only 300 go back with a gold medal, the number is very, very less. It takes time for an athlete to develop, you have to give the athletes a chance and time to develop and go there.

‚ÄúThe experience which they gain from their first Games, they may not (win) a medal, but it is going to add to their experience which will help them to go and win in perhaps next Games,‚Äù he signed off.

"SC strikes down instant triple talaq, victims of practice hail verdict","On Tuesday, the Supreme Court set aside the practice of divorce through triple talaq among Muslims, ruling that the practice was ‚Äòvoid and invalid‚Äô. (Express photo by Vishal Srivastav )

While Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice S Abdul Nazeer were in favour of putting on hold for six months the practice of triple talaq, Justices R F Nariman, Kurian Joseph, and U U Lalit held it as violative of the Constitution. However, the majority verdict, observed that any practice, including triple talaq, which is against the tenets of Quran is unacceptable. (Express photo by Vishal Srivastav )

(Reuters)

China today issued a special postal stamp to commemorate the ninth annual BRICS summit scheduled to be held early next month in the coastal city of Xiamen in the country‚Äôs southeastern Fujian province. The stamp issued by the state-owned China Post bears a logo of the summit as well as the letters ‚ÄúBRICS‚Äù and ‚Äú2017 China‚Äù.

It also shows the scenic Gulangyu island, which was included into the UNESCO list last month, as well as the other iconic sites of Xiamen like Xiamen University. ‚ÄúIt shows the features of Xiamen,‚Äù Zhang Zhijun, who is associated with the Xiamen branch of China Post, was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency.

‚ÄúWith the sea we would like to imply that the summit is a new starting point for the countries to sail into a bright future,‚Äù he said. The summit will be held from September 3 to 5. It is the second BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) summit to be held in China. The previous one was held in Sanya, Hainan province, in 2011.

The summit is being held in the backdrop of border tensions between India and China over the standoff at the Doklam area in the Sikkim section which has now entered the third month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, besides leaders of Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa is expected to take part in the summit.

Philatelists can buy eight-stamp sheets or individual stamps. The small sheet is made of silk, with a panorama picture of Gulangyu island by a local photographer Zhu Qingfu. The price of one stamp is 1.2 yuan (about 18 cents).

China previously has also issued stamps for the G20 Hangzhou Summit and the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. The BRICS forum, an independent international organisation encouraging commercial, political and cultural cooperation between the five-member nations, was formed in 2011.

"Spain hunts for driver in van rampage, says Islamist cell dismantled","People flee from the scene after a white van jumped the sidewalk in the historic Las Ramblas district of Barcelona, Spain, crashing into a summer crowd of residents and tourists Thursday. (Source: AP Photo) People flee from the scene after a white van jumped the sidewalk in the historic Las Ramblas district of Barcelona, Spain, crashing into a summer crowd of residents and tourists Thursday. (Source: AP Photo)

Police were searching on Saturday for the driver of a van that killed 13 people when it ploughed into a crowd in Barcelona and were trying to determine whether two other suspected Islamist militants linked to the attack had died or were at large. The Spanish government said it considered it had dismantled the cell behind Thursday‚Äôs Barcelona rampage and an attack early on Friday in the Catalan seaside town of Cambrils.

Police arrested four people in connection with the attacks Barcelona and Cambrils, where a woman was killed when a car rammed passersby on Friday. Five attackers wearing fake explosive belts were also shot dead in the Catalan town. ‚ÄúThe cell has been fully dismantled in Barcelona, after examining the people who died, the people who were arrested and carrying out identity checks,‚Äù Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido told a news conference.

But authorities have yet to identify the driver of the van and his whereabouts are unclear, while police and officials in the northeastern region of Catalonia said they still needed to locate up to two other people. Investigators are focusing on a group of at least 12 suspects believed to be behind the deadliest attacks to hit Spain in more than a decade.

In little more than a year, militants have used vehicles as weapons to kill nearly 130 people in France, Germany, Britain, Sweden and Spain. None of the nine people arrested or shot dead by police are believed to be the driver who sped into Las Ramblas, leaving a trail of dead and injured among the crowds of tourists and local residents strolling along the Barcelona boulevard.

A Moroccan-born 22-year-old called Younes Abouyaaqoub was among those being sought, according to the mayor‚Äôs office in the Catalan town of Ripoll, where he and other suspects lived. Spanish media reported that Abouyaaqoub may have been the driver of the van in Barcelona, but police and Catalan officials could not confirm this.

The driver in the Barcelona attack abandoned the van and fled on foot on Thursday after ploughing into the crowd. Fifty people were still in hospital on Saturday following that attack, with 13 in a critical condition. Many were foreign tourists. The Mediterranean region of Catalonian is thronged in the summer months with visitors drawn to its beaches and the port city of Barcelona‚Äôs museums and tree-lined boulevards. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks in Cambrils and Barcelona, a statement by the jihadist group said on Saturday.

RAIDS

Police searched a flat in Ripoll on Friday in their hunt for people connected to the attacks, the ninth raid so far on homes in the town nestled in the foothills of the Pyrenees near the French border. The flat had been occupied by a man named as Abdelbaki Es Satty, according to a search warrant seen by Reuters. Neighbours said he was an imam, a Muslim prayer leader. His landlord said he had last been seen on Tuesday.

Scraps of paper covered in notes were strewn around the flat, which had been turned upside down in the police search. Three Moroccans and a citizen of Spain‚Äôs North African enclave of Melilla have been arrested so far in connection with the attacks. Apart from Abouyaaqoub, authorities are searching for two other people though it is not certain they are at large.

One or even both of them may have been killed in Alcanar, where a house was razed by an explosion shortly before midnight on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Catalonia‚Äôs home affairs department said. Casting new doubts over the investigation, El Pais said late on Saturday that biological remains of at least three people had been found in the ruins of the Alcanar house. It was not clear whether they could be from the three suspects still sought by the police or if more people were there.

Police believe the house in Alcanar was being used to plan one or several large-scale attacks in Barcelona, possibly using a large number of butane gas canisters stored there. The Spanish government maintained its security alert level at four, one notch below the maximum level that would indicate another attack was imminent, but said it would reinforce security in crowded areas and tourist hotspots. Spanish media also said that security at the border with France was being beefed up.

TRIBUTES

Of the 14 dead in the two attacks, five are Spanish, two are Italians, two are Portuguese, one Belgian, one Canadian and one a US citizen, emergency services and authorities from those countries have confirmed so far. A seven-year-old boy with British and Australian nationality who had been missing since the attack in Barcelona was found on Saturday in one of the city‚Äôs hospitals and was in a serious condition, El Pais newspaper reported.

Spain‚Äôs King Felipe and Queen Letizia on Saturday visited some of the dozens injured whose nationalities ranged from French and German to Pakistani and the Filipino. They are being treated in various Barcelona hospitals. The royal couple are expected to take part in a Catholic mass on Sunday morning at architect Antoni Gaudi‚Äôs famous Sagrada Familia church, a Barcelona landmark, in honour of the victims of the attack.

Barcelona‚Äôs football team will wear special shirts, bearing the Catalan words for ‚ÄúWe are all Barcelona‚Äù, and black armbands in memory of victims when they play their opening league game of the season on Sunday evening against Real Betis.

Champion chaser Virat Kohli continues to scale new heights in 2017,"Virat Kohli is known for his prowess and calm-head-on-shoulders-approach when batting second and 2017 has been no different. (Source: AP) Virat Kohli is known for his prowess and calm-head-on-shoulders-approach when batting second and 2017 has been no different. (Source: AP)

There is no debating that Virat Kohli is one of the best batsmen in the world right now and that holds true in any format of the game. Be it Test matches where he stands comfortably to keep the runs flowing or to hold front; ODIs with steady flow of runs or T20Is where he knows how to keep his innings going and speed up when required. But what makes his performances even more worthy of applause is the fact that he doesn‚Äôt baffle under pressure. Despite being the captain of a team considered the best in the world, he is able to not just lead the side but also score runs at free will. Many players in the past and current, are unable to handle both the responsibilities ‚Äì Kohli clearly has embraced the added work.

One could go back to his remarkable chase against Australia in the World T20 last year where he scored 82 runs to take India into the semifinals and see how seamlessly he added runs to the total and didn‚Äôt lose his cool during the process. No wonder the skipper called it his best innings till date.

Moving into the new year, Kohli hasn‚Äôt changed even though there have been few off days for him this season. But when it comes to chasing runs, he still continues to be one of the best in the world and the numbers tell the story. He has scored 769 runs in ODIs this year in 14 matches played at an average of 96.12 with two centuries coming in the process. While chasing, he has scored 550 runs in eight innings for an equally commendable average of 137.50 and both the hundreds have come while batting second.

Virat Kohli, with 18 hundreds in 107 innings in chases has set a record, surpassing Virat Kohli, with 18 hundreds in 107 innings in chases has set a record, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar ‚Äôs feat of 17 in 232 innings. (Source: AP)

But his true excellence can be highlighted by the fact that Kohli‚Äôs average in India wins is a staggering 487! Whenever India wins, Kohli remains unbeaten. And that is not a one off case ‚Äì it has happened five times this year. The only anomaly being his 122 run knock against England at the start of the year. Later he led the side to wins against South Africa (76*), Bangladesh (96*), West Indies (111*) and most recently against Sri Lanka (82*).

"Srijan scam: In 2003, DM passed order to open accounts with NGO","The office of NGO Srijan at Sabour in Bhagalpur. Express Photo by Santosh Singh The office of NGO Srijan at Sabour in Bhagalpur. Express Photo by Santosh Singh

As allegations and counter-allegations fly over the Srijan scam expose, documents have revealed that it was in December 2003 when then Bhagalpur district magistrate K P Ramaiah passed an order to ‚Äúopen all kinds of accounts‚Äù with Sabour-based NGO Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti Limited to ‚Äúencourage‚Äù it.

It was also DM Ramaiah who directed the Sabour BDO to allot the block‚Äôs 24,275 sqft land on lease for 30 years on rent of Rs 2,400 per year on consideration of the NGO ‚Äúdoing social work in rural areas‚Äù. Rabri Devi was the Bihar CM between 2000 and 2005.

At a press meet on Monday, Bihar DGP P K Thakur presented documents related to allotment of the government land to the NGO. He also said a follow-up action was taken on complaint of Godda CA Sanjit Kumar to Bihar government and Union Finance Minister ‚Äî as reported by The Indian Express Monday. The DGP told reporters that registrar of cooperative societies (which was asked by RBI to follow up on the CA‚Äôs complaint against Srijan) had conveyed its remarks to Bhagalpur administration on March 5, 2014 and June 12, 2014.

‚ÄúAn Income-Tax Department team subsequently carried (out a) probe into activities of Srijan and shared its findings with RBI on April 1, 2014. On May 13, 2014, RBI asked Bihar cooperative societies registrar to look into the NGO‚Äôs activities following which regional officers were asked to follow I-T department‚Äôs instructions,‚Äù said the DGP. A special audit of the NGO showed that Know Your Customer (KYC) norm was followed. The auditing never pointed out that the NGO had been getting government funds.

The Indian Express has already reported that statements of the NGO‚Äôs accounts in nationalised banks were allegedly forged and government records had also fudged bank statements. Auditors never bothered to ask for statements from the banks and get certificates of transactions from bank managers as per standard practice of auditing.

The DGP said: ‚ÄúSo far 11 FIRs, nine in Bhagalpur and one each in Saharsa and Banka, have shown illegal transfer and embezzlement of Rs 870.88 crore. To ensure that Srijan secretary Priya Kumar and her husband Amit Kumar cannot leave the country, we have asked the regional passport office to seize their passports. CID has requested the Union home ministry to issue a lookout notice for them at all airports,‚Äù said the DGP.

Godda CA Sanjit Kumar told The Indian Express: ‚ÄúThe state police have not given full facts as it does not mention the September 9, 2013, RBI letter to Bihar cooperative societies‚Äôs registrar, which was sent after my letter to the Union finance minister. The DGP also did not answer the basic question if Srijan was allowed to do banking and why the I-T Department overlooked it.‚Äù

Indonesia to buy $1.14 billion worth of Russian jets,"Indonesia Air Force Sukhoi fighter jets fly near a statue over Merdeka Square during in Jakarta. (Source: Reuters) Indonesia Air Force Sukhoi fighter jets fly near a statue over Merdeka Square during in Jakarta. (Source: Reuters)

Indonesia will buy 11 Sukhoi fighter jets worth $1.14 billion from Russia in exchange for cash and Indonesian commodities, two cabinet ministers said on Tuesday. The Southeast Asian country has pledged to ship up to $570 million worth of commodities in addition to cash to pay for the Suhkoi SU-35 fighter jets, which are expected to be delivered in stages starting in two years.

Indonesian Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita said in a joint statement with Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu that details of the type and volume of commodities were ‚Äústill being negotiated‚Äù. Previously he had said the exports could include palm oil, tea, and coffee. The deal is expected to be finalised soon between Indonesian state trading company PT Perusahaan Perdangangan Indonesia and Russian state conglomerate Rostec.

Russia is currently facing a new round of U.S.-imposed trade sanctions.

Meanwhile, Southeast Asia‚Äôs largest economy is trying to promote its palm oil products amid threats of a cut in consumption by European Union countries. Indonesia is also trying to modernise its ageing air force after a string of military aviation accidents. Indonesia, which had a $411 million trade surplus with Russia in 2016, wants to expand bilateral cooperation in tourism, education, energy, technology and aviation among others.

Sketches of a Poet‚Äôs soul,"Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature. Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature.

Book- Faiz Ahmad Faiz: Colour of My Heart, Selected Poems

Translated by- Baran Farooqi

Publication- Penguin Random House India

Pages- 304

Price- Rs 499

The name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds most people of melodious voices of Noor Jahan and Nayyara Noor, and the songs Mujh Se Pahli Si Muhobbat Meri Mehboob Na Mang, Ham Dekhenge or Aaj Bazar Mein Paa-ba Jolan Chalo. For those who have a deeper interest in Urdu poetry, it evokes many more images. Faiz symbolises a turning point in the history of the Urdu language ‚Äî his name evokes memories of the Progressive Writers Association (PWA), his poetry is reminiscent of an era when the best of minds produced great literature in Urdu, which inspires writers and poets even today.

Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature. No nation state has been able to create impermeable fortifications thick enough to withstand the osmotic pressure which arts and literature produces. Even if these walls are constructed on the dense bedrock of hate and animosity.

Faiz‚Äôs poetry kept on transcending geographical boundaries and made him the most celebrated poet of the Indian subcontinent. But what makes Faiz unique, and I have said this earlier in an article, is that his poetry also transcends caste, class, regional and even linguistic boundaries. It is not unusual to see processions in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, where workers, students or political activists walk on streets with posters on which Bol Ke Lab Azaad Hain Tere or Nisar Main Teri Galyon Pe Aye Watan Ke Jahan, Chali Hai Rasm Ke Koi Na Sar Uttha Ke Chale is written. If you walk into a five star hotel and witness Faiz being sung by a renowned singer, it would not be considered out of the ordinary. Faiz is the only poet who has no adversaries. Even the mullahs in Pakistan did not pass a fatwa against him.

Faiz Ahmad Faiz (centre) with Javed Akhtar (right). Express Archives Faiz Ahmad Faiz (centre) with Javed Akhtar (right). Express Archives

Faiz‚Äôs name also reminds us of the great divide between taraqqi pasand (the progressives) and jadidiyat pasand (modernists). Those who called themselves modernists in India were essentially anti-communist, backed by international groups who professed ‚Äòart for the sake of art‚Äô and ‚Äòart with no political objective‚Äô. This group consistently attacked all writers, poets, filmmakers and artists who were members of PWA. Their politics drove them to condemn and reject all those who were committed to the idea of equality and justice, and created literature to build consciousness around these ideals.

Faiz demolished the wall created by the modernists. They initially tried to ignore him but did not succeed. In an Urdu magazine, Tehrik (Silver Jubilee Number), Wazir Agha wrote an article on ‚Äò25 years of Urdu literature in Pakistan‚Äô. He listed the names of 30 poets, without mentioning Faiz. In passing elsewhere in the article, he mentioned Faiz as a progressive poet who ‚Äúdid not toe the party line and therefore created some good literary pieces‚Äù.

Similarly in Guftugoo, Balraj Komal, in an article titled ‚ÄòPoetry of Straight and Curvilinear Lines‚Äô, placed Faiz‚Äôs work on the border of this divide vis-a-vis Ali Sardar Jafri, Sahir Ludhyanvi and Josh Malihabadi; and, therefore categorised it as ‚Äòeffective‚Äô. These assertions were utterly false because Faiz remained committed to the ideals of socialism till his last breath. These were only excuses for liking a revolutionary poet. Almost every word of his poetry is dedicated to the idea of building an equitable and just society, yet his grandeur was accepted by even those who stood on the other side of the political fence.

The book Faiz Ahmad Faiz: Colour of My Heart, Selected Poems provides yet more proof of my assertion. In her introduction, the translator, Baran Farooqui, has made her political position very clear. She has referred to Faiz and many other progressive writers as ‚Äúarmchair socialists‚Äù, ignoring the fact that some of them, including Faiz, spent long years in jail for their ideological commitment. An unnecessary reference to Stalin could also have been avoided. She has not minced her words to reveal her unsympathetic attitude towards Faiz‚Äôs political views. The rest of the introduction is full of ‚Äòilluminating‚Äô information and she has translated the poems with utmost care, restrain and thoughtfulness. The soft, firm and robust ‚Äòking of romantic realism‚Äô deserves no less, even from those who do not agree with him. The ideological bias is completely absent in the translation.

When I read the list of 57 selected poems I was a bit disappointed that Intisab, Raqeeb Se, and Mauzu-e-Sukhan were missing. But when I moved on to the introduction it was clear that these poems did not measure up to the taste of the selector for obvious reasons.

If you are in love with a piece of literature in its original form ‚Äî and I am an unashamed lover of every poem that Faiz wrote ‚Äî then it is painful to read its translation. For me there are two indicators of good translation. The first test is: choose lines from the middle of a poem, read, and if you are able to recollect the original, then it is a good translation. I performed this test on every poem in this book. The second test is: the translated poem must invoke the same or similar feeling which the original does. Farooqi‚Äôs translation passes both these tests with very high marks. For all those who understand Urdu but cannot read ‚Äòfarsi rasm-ul khat‚Äô the appendix provides transliteration of all selected poems, carefully scripted with the correct pronunciation of each word.

Farooqi refers to seven translators who introduced Faiz to non-Urdu readers, during his lifetime. I have not read all of them, but on the basis of whatever I‚Äôve gone through, Farooqi‚Äôs translation is incredibly close to the spirit of Faiz‚Äôs poetry. I‚Äôm sure after reading this book, non-Urdu-Hindi readers will gain a deeper understanding of his life and poetry.

Tottenham Hotspur vs Chelsea: Five talking points as Marcos Alonso brace seals Wembley victory,"Marcos Alonso scored a brace. (Source: Reuters) Marcos Alonso scored a brace. (Source: Reuters)

Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea played the first London derby of the season which turned out to be a thrilling match for the two top teams of the league. Chelsea defeated the Spurs 2-1 to end up with three points after a shocking loss in their opening game of the season against Burnley FC.

Here are the five talking points from Tottenham Hotspur vs Chelsea:

Marcos Alonso

Definitely the star of the match, Marcos Alonso impressed with two brilliant goals to become the most talked about element of the Premier League fixture. Scoring both the goals for Chelsea, Alonso became the sole reason for Chelsea‚Äôs three points from this tough fixture.

Chelsea still the strongest

After Chelsea had a brilliant campaign last season, ending at the top with a big point difference to trailing Tottenham Hotspur, critics questioned if the club would be able to maintain the consistency in the following season. And many did read into the Blues‚Äô poor show in the pre-season when Antonio Conte‚Äôs men lost multiple matches as well as the FA Community Shield final against Arsenal, along with the first domestic league match against Burnley FC. They, however, proved the critics wrong by giving a tough fight to a powerful team.

Tottenham Hotspur‚Äôs failed chances

Even though Chelsea won the match without the home advantage, the Spurs need to be given credit for holding their fort and giving a tough fight till the very end. And that was visible by Tottenham‚Äôs creation of chances throughout the game.

Here is the division of shots, possession, chances created and pass accuracy between the two teams that will prove that they were the better yet unlucky team of the day.

Shots: 19-10

Possession: 60%-40%

Chances created: 14-9

Pass accuracy: 85%-72%

Tiemoue Bakayoko proves his worth

When Chelsea brought in Tiemoue Bakayoko in place of Nemanja Matic, the move was very critically accessed and some even warned Conte that he would go down. The Serb, however, proved his worth in the game on Sunday when he was included in the playing XI in place of suspended Cesc Fabregas. Bakayoka played well on the left, despite being more comfortable in the center of the midfield.

Spurs‚Äô Wembley woes continue

While the White Hart Lane is being redeveloped, Tottenham will be playing all their home games in all competitions at Wembley this season. But to their disadvantage, their record at the stadium looks terrifying and the London derby proved just that. Even though the atmosphere was magical, the team needs to forget the woriries attacked to the stadium and put their best foot forward.

The song that‚Äôs India: Revisiting Desh Raag,"(From left) Pt Ravi Shankar on the sitar, tabla maestro Zakir Hussain. (From left) Pt Ravi Shankar on the sitar, tabla maestro Zakir Hussain.

On the morning of August 15, 1989, India woke up to Desh raag, a celebration of the nation through classical music and dance. India, with its newly acquired colour television sets, watched as Pandit Bhimsen Joshi invoked Desh, a soothing late evening raga associated with the monsoons and the Indian national song ‚Äî Bankim Chandra Chatterjee‚Äôs Vande Mataram.

Set against a waterfall and majestic mountains, we saw a solemn looking Joshi sing Lab pe jaage geet aisa, Goonje bankar des raag in his sonorous voice to the sounds of a tabla and tanpura. His verses were followed by the doleful strains of a sarangi played by Pt Ram Narayan. There was also sitar maestro Pt Ravi Shankar strumming the seven sitar strings with exuberance, Pt Hari Prasad Chaurasia breathing life into a reed, Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma playing the santoor, M Balamuralikrishna playing the violin and singing Baje sargam in Tamil, and, the famed tabla dual between Ustad Allah Rakha and Zakir Hussain, with the tricolour as the background ‚Äî all inseparable elements of Desh raag.

The orchestral masterpiece also showcased various classical dance forms through short pieces: Kathak exponent Shovana Narayan danced at Fatehpur Sikri followed by Protima Bedi presenting Odissi on Juhu beach, Mallika Sarabhai giving a glimpse of Bharatanatyam, Kanak Rele presenting Mohiniattam and Swapna Sundari dancing the Kuchipudi.

This was India through sound and video, a glimpse into its rich and diverse cultural fabric. ‚ÄúIt was also education. Telling the people about one of India‚Äôs most significant pillars ‚Äî the classical arts,‚Äù says Narayan.

Conceptualised by Suresh Mullick, creative director of Ogilvy back then, and directed by Kailash Surendranath for Lok Sewa Sanchar Parishad, the piece was commissioned by the Rajiv Gandhi government ‚Äúto raise the morale of people in a pre-liberalised India‚Äù. It was the third and final piece in a trilogy of short films; the other two being Freedom Run ‚Äî The Torch Song and Mile sur mera tumhara. ‚ÄúMost of the credit goes to the fine performances of these classical heavyweights and Suresh Mullick who thought of the idea. It came when the economy was underdeveloped, the country was facing unrest and the people needed a unity in diversity message,‚Äù says Surendranath about the piece, which was composed mainly by Joshi. It was later put together by prominent jazz musician, Louis Banks. Mullick also got composer P Vaidyanathan and cinematographer RK Rao on board.

For lyrics, Mullick went to one of his own ‚Äî Piyush Pande. ‚ÄúBaje sargam har taraf se, goonje bankar desh raag, said everything it had to. Suresh was my boss, and very particular. He said we should use analogies, and that people are smart enough to understand that we are talking of integration,‚Äù says Pande, now CEO, Ogilvy & Mather.

Surendranath, however, claims that Pandit Vinod Sharma (remembered for writing the popular Nirma advertisement) wrote the famed lines and that Pande didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúPandit Sharma was a dear associate and friend but he had nothing to do with the lyrics of the trilogy. Suresh is dead now and people want to create some or the other controversy over the piece, but all his old interviews, in great detail, talk about the process of writing both Mile sur and Desh raag and how he had commissioned them to me,‚Äù says Pande.

The process of completing the short film took over a month. Long fax messages were constantly exchanged between Banks and Mullick. Cinematographer Rao travelled across the country to shoot the film. ‚ÄúIt was the simplicity that worked,‚Äù says Rao about the video that quite possibly helped many to grasp that Kathakali and Manipuri were classical art forms and not folk dances.

While Mile sur was about seven minutes long, Desh raag exceeded 13 minutes. Brilliant and technically sound as the piece was, Desh raag found more acceptance in the art circles as compared to the masses. ‚ÄúThere hasn‚Äôt been a better musical genius than Suresh. But in hindsight, I think he went a little overboard. When the artiste in you gets too involved, that can happen. His artistic leanings resulted in the length becoming a problem. We loved those pieces by the artistes so much that we got carried away and got lost in its brilliance. It‚Äôs so beautiful and became extremely popular but not as much as Mile sur,‚Äù says Pande about the piece for which no artiste charged any fee.

The final lines of the national anthem were included towards the end of the film and that proved to be an impediment. ‚ÄúThe authorities did not like our inclusion of the last bit of the national anthem ‚Äî an incomplete anthem was considered inappropriate. But we managed to show it to Rajivji who loved it. He did not want anything changed,‚Äù says Surendranath.

Five books to look forward to in August 2017,"Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon) Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon)

Another month has gone by and a fresh set of books is ready to hit the nearest stands. With an intriguing mix of genres ‚Äî dominated by non-fiction ‚Äî August offers simple reading options without the hype that distracts and manipulates readers.

There are no big literary names, no grand book launches for the upcoming books in the coming month. Readers, thus, will have an opportunity to pick titles on the basis of merit and not on the credentials of their authors.

For those looking to focus on more trending issues, we have a couple of political biographies releasing ‚Äî and, yes, one is on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi. More literary readers may look forward to two anthologies of late writer Khushwant Singh. The list also has a revised biography of Agatha Christie, whose thrillers have once again created a buzz on social media after HarperCollins India released 25 limited facsimile editions of the best books from the Queen of Crime. There are several books focussing on economy and business from Hachette India.

But here are the five books that we can‚Äôt wait to read this August:

* The Generation of Rage in Kashmir by David Devadas (Oxford University Press)

This book by a former editor at Business Standard describes the livid experience of Kashmiris who came of age between 2007 and 2017. It shows that Kashmiris generally had high hopes for peace and stability when the militancy, which began in 1988, seemed to be tapering off around 2006 ‚Äî but alas, that was not to be. It explores the reasons why there was so much angst and rage, which exploded in agitations and stone-pelting in 2008, 2010, and 2016 and why a new militancy is on the rise. The book also traces the decline of hope among the Kashmiris as the situation worsened from a perceived threat to their identity in 2008 to rage over the killing of innocents in 2010. The anger, the author argues, has finally resulted in support for militancy in 2016.

St Kitts and Nevis hold Mauritius to 1-1 draw in tri-nation football tournament,"St Kitts and Nevis had to wait for 68 minutes for the equaliser. (Source: PTI) St Kitts and Nevis had to wait for 68 minutes for the equaliser. (Source: PTI)

St Kitts and Nevis found a late equaliser as their match against Mauritius ended in a 1-1 draw in the tri-nation football tournament in Mumbai on Tuesday. Rogers Kimaree struck in the 87th minute after Jean Frederic Sarah had put Mauritius ahead in the 19th minute off a header.

Mauritius looked organised, adopted an aggressive approach from the start and had better possession of the ball.

It helped them take a 1-0 lead in the 19th minute. From a cross from the flank by defender Pascal Damien Balisson, Sarah gave Mauritius the lead off a header.

St Kitts and Nevis had to wait for 68 minutes for the equaliser. Assisted by forward Tishan Hanley, Kimaree ran in and netted the ball even as a handful of fans cheered at the Andheri Sports Complex.

Going into the game, Mauritian coach Francisco Filo left out goalkeeper Kevin Obrian Jean-Louis and replaced him with James Caserne.

After the break, Mauritius missed a chance to extend their lead as Jean Mervyn Jocelyn‚Äôs shot was on target only to be saved by St Kitts and Nevis custodian with a dive.

A few minutes after that, Sarah‚Äôs header went completely off target, even as the St Kitts and Nevis defence was tested all through the game.

Mauritius again had a chance but Louis Guiyano Chiffone, who got a pass from Sarah, hit marginally wide. Sarah, who was the best Mauritian player, had another chance but this time, he too missed the target.

The other notable chance for St Kitts and Nevis came when Kimaree shot at the goal after a through ball which was saved by the goalkeeper.

St Kitts and Nevis coach Jacques Passy said that his team played a ‚Äúvery bad first half‚Äù.

‚ÄúI would not call an excellent, but an above average performance. We had six goal opportunities, (but) a draw leaves me with a smile,‚Äù said Passy.

His boys play India on August 24 and Passy termed the hosts as favourites.

‚ÄúI have no excuse philosophy, If we win, we are the champions. If India win, they are champions. I am facing a great team (India), which everyone should be proud of. We can do much better. ‚ÄúThe absolute favourite to win the tournament is India. It is no more a three nation, but a two-nation tournament. Our focus is on India,‚Äù the coach said.

‚ÄúToday, our display was below than what the team can do, it was not a tactical problem. We were not just comfortable. India are the favourites,‚Äù he maintained.

Mauritian coach Filo said his side will hope to improve. St Kitts and Nevis play hosts India on August 24 at the same venue.

German foreign minister asks Berlin and Europe to back Turks who did not support Turkish President Erdogan,"‚ÄúErdogan‚Äôs approach clearly motivates some people to try to threaten and harrass my wife,‚Äù German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel said. (File ‚Äì AP Photos) ‚ÄúErdogan‚Äôs approach clearly motivates some people to try to threaten and harrass my wife,‚Äù German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel said. (File ‚Äì AP Photos)

Germany‚Äôs foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel said Berlin and the rest of Europe should back the ‚Äúdemocratically minded‚Äù majority of Turks who did not support President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in a dramatic hardening of Germany‚Äôs posture towards Ankara.

His remarks, at a campaign event for his Social Democratic Party (SPD), come amid sharply deteriorating relations between the NATO allies, after Erdogan urged German Turks to boycott Germany‚Äôs main parties in next month‚Äôs election.

‚ÄúMore than half the country is democratically minded. They didn‚Äôt support him,‚Äù Gabriel was quoted by press agency DPA as saying at the meeting in the western Saarland region. ‚ÄúI believe that many in Turkey are counting on Europe and Germany supporting Turkish democracy and not looking on helplessly.‚Äù

The remarks, coming after Erdogan told Gabriel to ‚Äúknow his place‚Äù and describing Germany‚Äôs main parties as ‚Äúenemies of Turkey‚Äù, are likely to anger Turkey. Erdogan accuses Germany of harbouring plotters behind last year‚Äôs bloody coup attempt against Erdogan. Turkey has arrested 50,000 in a crackdown, including European-Turkish citizens. Western politicians say the dragnet is a pretext for Erdogan to rid himself of his opponents.

A senior lawmaker from Chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs Christian Democrat party (CDU) went further. In a radio interview, foreign policy specialist Roderich Kiesewetter urged the government to consider freezing the foreign assets of ‚Äúthe Erdogan clan‚Äù. In his remarks on Monday evening, Gabriel was cautious on sanctions, saying that Germany did not want inadvertently to hit ‚Äúthe small restaurant owners and waiters on the west coast.‚Äù

Gabriel said the personal nature of Erdogan‚Äôs attacks on him had emboldened people to make threats against his wife at the dental surgery where she worked. ‚ÄúErdogan‚Äôs approach clearly motivates some people to try to threaten and harrass my wife,‚Äù he said.

The latest escalation in Ankara‚Äôs war of words with Berlin was triggered by Turkey‚Äôs use of an Interpol red notice to have Turkish-German writer Dogan Akhanli arrested in Spain. Accused of terrorism, Akhanli has been released but must remain in Spain while authorities assess Turkey‚Äôs extradition request.

‚ÄúI always thought I was safe in European countries and that the long hand of arbitrary arrogance couldn‚Äôt reach me here,‚Äù said the activist, who spent long periods in jail for left-wing activism before fleeing Turkey in 1991.

"India vs Sri Lanka, 1st ODI: Rohit Sharma‚Äôs dismal run in Sri Lanka continues","Rohit Sharma scored 4 runs in the first ODI against Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters) Rohit Sharma scored 4 runs in the first ODI against Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters)

Playing his first competitive match since the Champions Trophy 2017 final, Indian opener Rohit Sharma failed to leave a mark as his stay at the crease during the first ODI against Sri Lanka in Dambulla wasn‚Äôt a long one. Rohit was sent back in a bizarre manner after a run-out. While trying to complete a run, he had his bat stuck in the ground that prevented the right-handed batsman from completing the run and fielder Chamara Kapugedara‚Äôs direct-hit completed the run-out.

Sharma last played for India in Champions Trophy and warmed the bench in Test series against Sri Lanka before getting back in action on Sunday. The right-hander has had a dismal run in the previous ten innings while playing in Sri Lanka as his scoring tally reads 4, 0, 11, 5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4.

Earlier, in the day, Virat Kohli won the toss and elected to bowl first. Sri Lanka started off the proceedings in a decent manner when the openers Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka scored 74 runs for the first wicket and later Dickwella along with Kusal Mendis notched up a partnership of 65 runs for second wicket.

But Sr Lanka‚Äôs scoring rate was put to a halt when Kohli introduced spin from both ends. The trio of Yuzvendra Chahal, Axar Patel and Kedar Jadhav shared seven wickets out of the 1 while Patel returned with figures of 3/34 in 10 overs.

The home side eventually managed to score 216 in 43.2 overs before getting bowled out. Former captain Angelo Mathews did provide some resistance to his team but it was never enough to anchor them to a big total.

SC notice to Centre on protection for disabled,"Supreme Court (File) Supreme Court (File)

The Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to the Centre on a petition seeking constitutional protection for people with ‚Äúdisability‚Äù. The bench of Chief Justice of India J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud issued notice to the Union Finance Ministry on a plea by Nipun Malhotra, who runs the charitable trust Nipman Foundation, which works in the field of disability-related policy and education for the economically underprivileged.

Though the petition also wanted the Supreme Court to quash the provisions of the Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, that levy a tax burden on medical devices or mobility equipment like wheelchairs, Braille papers, tricycles and crutches, CJI Khehar pointed out to petitioner‚Äôs counsel Jai Dehadrai that the court was already seized of a similar plea and wondered why it should admit another petition that highlighted the same issue. The counsel then told the court that the present petition raised the question of constitutional protection for disabled.

"Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: This Rajkummar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon film works in fits and starts","Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast. Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast.

Bareilly Ki Barfi star cast: Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon, Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi, Seema Tripathi

Bareilly Ki Barfi director: Ashwini Iyer Tiwari

Bareilly Ki Barfi rating: 2.5 stars

‚ÄòBareilly ke bazaar mein barfi giri re‚Äô. Clearly, the film was made keeping the iconic song in mind, except with an alliterative ‚Äòbarfi‚Äô not a ‚Äòjhumka‚Äô in mind.

This Small-Town Rom Com ticks all the boxes going in: perky girl armed with requisite quirky parents, a couple of suitable boys, and great one liners. And it does work in fits and starts, but it flattens equally in between. The thing with dreaming up smart lines, and there are some quite wonderfully flavoursome ones in here, is that sometimes entire scenes get written just to be able to include the punch-lines: this ‚Äòmithai‚Äô has several such sequences, and make the run-time flabby.

One fine day, Bitti Mishra (Sanon) pronounced, quite properly Misra, by the ‚Äòh‚Äô dropping Bareilly-walas, sets her heart on meeting a mysterious someone who seems to know her inside out. Local printing press owner Chirag (Khurrana) is smitten. And then arrives a guy who goes by the name of Pritam Vidrohi (Rao) who is the fly in the ointment. Or is he? Will the new entrant surge ahead? Who will win the fair maiden?

Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast: Tripathi, who‚Äôs much too young to play the leading lady‚Äôs father, does a good job of being Bitti‚Äôs papa, who‚Äôs more like a pal than a pa. Pahwa scores another ace after Aankhon Dekhi: what a lovely actress she is.

The two actors who play the best friends, one who accompanies Khurrana, and the other who is seen with Sanon, are pitch perfect. They show up the problems that Sanon has with merging into her part: she tries hard to the be the small-town girl who likes a couple of puffs on the side, and who break dances for fun, but the effort shows.

The plot‚Äôs contrivances come in the way of Khurrana‚Äôs playing of Chirag fully credibly. As does Rajkummar Rao, who blows away the weaknesses of this film with his consummate act, playing the timid ‚Äòchota shehari‚Äô on the one hand, and the loud ‚Äòrangbaaz‚Äô on the other.

Rao sweetens the pot, and makes up for the rest of it. Almost.

Kidambi Srikanth sails into second round of World Badminton Championships,"Kidambi Srikanth advanced to the second round at World Championships. Kidambi Srikanth advanced to the second round at World Championships.

Kidambi Srikanth had to wait a bit for his campaign to get his World Championships campaign to get underway.

Srikanth warmed up in the game by taking an 11-5 lead at the break in the first game before racing away with it. In just 12 minutes he wrapped up the game 21-13.

Sirant, who displayed a better performance in the next game knowing that he has nothing to lose, did come up with some good shots but Srikanth was up for everything.

The number eight seed was brilliant in his defence against Sirant and combined it with some brilliant drop shots. Many unforced errors from Sirant also helped him. The Indian took a 18-10 lead and was looking comfortable.

He also opted to have some fun with some trick shots against Sirant. With eight match points, Srikanth looked all set to take the match and he only needed one match point to complete the victory in 28 minutes.

"Revamped AC Milan wins 3-0 at Crotone, Inter beats Fiorentina","Andre Silva celebrates scoring for AC Milan. (Source: Reuters) Andre Silva celebrates scoring for AC Milan. (Source: Reuters)

The new-look AC Milan team proved just as effective in Serie A as it has been in Europe, easing to a 3-0 win at 10-man Crotone on Sunday ‚Äì albeit with the aid of video technology. Milan, which beat Shkendija 6-0 in the Europa League on Thursday, started a number of its new signings but it was youth academy graduate Patrick Cutrone who made the difference.

Crotone got off to the worst possible start. After only four minutes, Federico Ceccherini brought down Cutrone and, after consulting with the VAR, the referee sent off the defender and awarded the visitors a penalty, which Franck Kessie converted for his first goal for his new club.

The 19-year-old Cutrone got on the scoresheet himself in the 18th minute, heading home Suso‚Äôs cross. Cutrone also had a hand in Milan‚Äôs third, springing the offside trap before pulling the ball back for Suso to fire into the bottom right corner.

Video technology was also needed in Inter Milan‚Äôs 3-0 victory over Fiorentina, which saw visiting coach Stefano Pioli return to San Siro just a few months after being fired by the Nerazzurri.

New Inter signings Borja Valero and Matias Vecino were also facing their old club, having transferred from Fiorentina in the offseason. Inter took the lead in the sixth minute when Mauro Icardi won and converted a penalty. The referee used the VAR to rule that Davide Astori had fouled the Argentine. Icardi doubled his tally nine minutes later, heading in Ivan Perisic‚Äôs cross.

The referee consulted with the VAR again shortly before halftime, after Giovanni Simeone had gone down under a challenge by Miranda, before waving away the Fiorentina penalty appeals.

Fiorentina had chances to reduce the deficit, notably when Jordan Veretout hit the post, before Perisic sealed the match late on with a stooping header into the bottom right corner from Joao Mario‚Äôs cross.

Roma‚Äôs new era without Francesco Totti got off to a winning start with a 1-0 victory at Atalanta in Serie A. This is the first season in 25 years that Roma has been without Totti, who retired at the end of the last campaign. It was also the capital club‚Äôs first match under new coach Eusebio Di Francesco.

Aleksandar Kolarov, who was signed from Manchester City in July, scored a half-hour into his debut, sending a cheeky free kick under the wall and into the bottom right corner. Atalanta almost leveled three minutes from time but Josip Ilicic hit Papu Gomez‚Äôs cross onto the right post from almost on the goalline.

Amato Ciciretti scored Benevento‚Äôs first-ever Serie A goal but it proved to be in vain as Sampdoria fought back to win 2-1. Ciciretti controlled Danilo Cataldi‚Äôs cross and curled a beautiful effort into the left side of the net in the 15th.

However, Fabio Quagliarella tapped in a rebound before halftime and doubled his tally in the 54th. Spal‚Äôs return to the top flight was more positive as it managed to hold Italian Super Cup winners Lazio to a 0-0 draw. Spal, which won the second division last season, is back in Serie A for the first time since 1968.

Chievo won 2-1 at Udinese, while Sassuolo drew 0-0 at home to Genoa. Torino drew 1-1 at Bologna.

"‚ÄòSome simple, inexpensive steps will get you cleaner air‚Äô","It was not until Beijing‚Äôs ‚ÄòAirpocalypse‚Äô in January 2013 that Talhelm began to ‚Äúreally understand and think about air pollution,‚Äù he told The Indian Express. (Representative Image) It was not until Beijing‚Äôs ‚ÄòAirpocalypse‚Äô in January 2013 that Talhelm began to ‚Äúreally understand and think about air pollution,‚Äù he told The Indian Express. (Representative Image)

Clean air should not be a luxury and a lot more people should be able to afford it, Thomas Talhelm, assistant professor of behavioural science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said on Monday.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fall prey to the idea that if you spend more money, you will get to breathe cleaner air. There are few simple and effective options that don‚Äôt require too much money,‚Äù he said, speaking at the University of Chicago Center in Delhi.

Talhelm, who has spent several years researching in Beijing, said that ‚Äúawareness‚Äù on air pollution has been the catalysis for change in China. ‚ÄúThe biggest thing holding peope back is lack of awareness about air pollution. It‚Äôs only in the last 10 years that people in China are freaking out about how the air affects their children,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDelhi has a serious pollution problem now and it‚Äôs a common misconception that it is fine during the summers. But I just tested the air outside and it is equivalent to 60 mg of PM 2.5 (the acceptable level is 25 mg).‚Äù

He also pointed out that general particulate matter comes into Beijing from surrounding areas pretty evenly, but in Delhi it really does matter where the sample is taken since the source of pollution is very heterogenous. For instance, he talked about people burning leaves or rubbish in a street corner.

It was not until Beijing‚Äôs ‚ÄòAirpocalypse‚Äô in January 2013 that Talhelm began to ‚Äúreally understand and think about air pollution,‚Äù he told The Indian Express. ‚ÄúAir purifiers are not complicated but people want you to believe that they are,‚Äù he said. Soon after, he began his experiments to build his own ‚ÄòDIY air purifier‚Äô with a fan borrowed from a friend and a filter purchased online for Rs 1,100, and strung both together with a tape measure.

The company he started, ‚ÄòSmartAir‚Äô, has since sold over 30,000 DIY air purifiers within China, and has shipped to India and Mongolia.

"India vs Sri Lanka, 1st ODI: The quick and the dead","Shikhar Dhawan shared a 197-run partnership with captain Virat Kohli that was the cornerstone of India‚Äôs chase against Sri Lanka. (PTI) Shikhar Dhawan shared a 197-run partnership with captain Virat Kohli that was the cornerstone of India‚Äôs chase against Sri Lanka. (PTI)

In the penultimate over of the match, Lasith Malinga attempted a yorker but missed his length a wee bit. Virat Kohli stayed on the crease and slapped it past the bowler for four. It was arrogance personified. It was difficult not to be arrogant against such a meek opponent. The whole match, in fact the whole tour so far, has had been like PlayStation cricket that gives you an option for difficulty settings. From a neutral‚Äôs perspective, the Indian dominance ‚Äî 3-0 Test whitewash followed by a thumping victory in the first ODI of the five-match series ‚Äî is now bordering on boredom.

In Dambulla on Sunday, the visitors won by nine wickets with 21.1 overs to spare ‚Äì India‚Äôs biggest in this format in terms of balls remaining. Shikhar Dhawan toyed with the Sri Lankan bowling to remain 132 not out off 90 balls. Kohli sauntered to an unbeaten 82 off 70 balls. This was Dhawan‚Äôs 11th ODI hundred and his scores on this tour now read: 190, 14, 35 and 119 in Tests, and 132 not out in the first ODI. The Delhi left-hander averages over 80 against Sri Lanka in the 50-over format. But we would come to his innings later.

The Test rollovers happened at sparsely-attended grounds. The Dambulla International Stadium witnessed a near full house. Fancy dresses, trumpets, bugles ‚Äì it was a party out there on the terraces. A group of young supporters in front of the press box started a series of lung-busting songs early afternoon, when Kohli and Upul Tharanga walked out for the toss.

By the time, Dhawan reached his hundred with a steer to the square third man boundary, the drums were packed and the noise level dropped to barely audible. Sri Lankan fans have now learnt to accept defeats with a rueful smile. If Dhawan hammered the hosts in the second half, Kedar Jadhav rattled the Sri Lankan innings with his low-arm, seemingly innocuous off-spin after Kohli won the toss and elected to field. Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka‚Äôs smooth passage to a 74-run first-wicket stand had started to question the India captain‚Äôs wisdom. Sri Lanka were 139 for one in the 25th over, when the slide started. They lost nine wickets for 77 runs to be all out for 216.

Dickwella looked Sri Lanka‚Äôs best bet to take his team to a challenging total. He was well past his half-century and showing promise. Jadhav fired in a straight delivery from around the wicket. The opener attempted a lap sweep, completely unprepared for the faster ball. He was trapped plumb in front. Then, Jadhav bowled a full-toss and had Tharanga caught at long-on. The job was done and the part-timer nonchalantly took a back seat to allow the frontline bowlers to take charge. Axar Patel had been an automatic pick in this game because of the additional benefit in terms of his lower-order batting. Yuzvendra Chahal being preferred over Kuldeep Jadhav was down to having a left-right combination. Two left-arm spinners, albeit one of the chinaman variety, could have been a little predictable.

Patel accounted for Kusal Mendis with a faster delivery. He held it back a little to outsmart Wanindu Hasaranga. The left-arm spinner finished with three wickets. Chahal and Bumrah bagged two scalps apiece. But the first half of the match was basically about second-string Indian spinners exposing Sri Lanka‚Äôs batting naivety. At the post-match press conference, Dhawan was asked whether this was the weakest bowling he had ever faced. The opener chose to be politically correct, saying: ‚ÄúNo, I wouldn‚Äôt say that. I don‚Äôt use those harsh words. The left-arm bowler (Vishwa Fernando) bowls decent pace and even the other fast bowler‚Ä¶ They have a good fast bowling attack, even in the Champions Trophy, they beat us. It‚Äôs just that we have got a mature side‚Ä¶‚Äù

The fact of the matter is that, with Malinga now over the hill, pedestrian would be an understatement to describe the Sri Lankan bowling. Dhawan had them at his mercy; cutting, pulling and reverse-sweeping to reach his ton in just 71 balls ‚Äì his fastest in ODIs. His innings had 20 fours and three sixes.

The entire Sri Lanka innings had 20 boundaries. A cover drive off Malinga early in his innings was Dhawan‚Äôs finest on the night. The shot of the match, however, came from his skipper, when Kohli got to the pitch of a flighted delivery from Lakshan Sandakan and flicked his wrists to send it over mid-wicket for four. Then, Kohli went back to a short ball from the chinaman bowler and dispatched it over the long-on boundary with a straight bat. As easy as it gets‚Ä¶

The only mishap during India‚Äôs chase was Rohit Sharma‚Äôs run out. The newly-appointed vice-captain dropped his bat and had his feet in the air despite crossing the crease. Back to PlayStation cricket and the unbroken 197-run second-wicket partnership between Dhawan and Kohli felt like setting the degree of difficulty at the beginner‚Äôs level.

US warship collides with tanker near Singapore; 10 missing,"It is the second collision involving a ship from the Navy‚Äôs 7th Fleet in the Pacific in two months. (Representational) It is the second collision involving a ship from the Navy‚Äôs 7th Fleet in the Pacific in two months. (Representational)

At least 10 U.S. sailors are missing after the USS John S. McCain collided with a tanker early Monday east of Singapore and the Strait of Malacca, the second collision involving a ship from the Navy‚Äôs 7th fleet in the Pacific in two months. The Navy said five other sailors were hurt in the collision involving the guided-missile destroyer. It had been heading to Singapore on a routine port visit after last week conducting a sensitive freedom of navigation operation by sailing near one of China‚Äôs man-made islands in the South China Sea.

It wasn‚Äôt immediately clear if the oil and chemical tanker Alnic MC sustained damage or casualties. The McCain was damaged on its port side aft, or left rear, from the accident that happened at 5:24 a.m., the Navy‚Äôs 7th Fleet said, but was heading to port under its own power. Malaysia‚Äôs navy chief Ahmad Kamarulzaman Ahmad Badaruddin tweeted that two ships as well as aircraft from its navy and air force have been deployed to help look for the missing U.S. sailors. The Navy said Osprey aircraft and Seahawk helicopters from the USS America were assisting in the search. It also said tugboats and Singaporean naval and coast guard vessels were in the area to render assistance.

The Strait of Malacca is a narrow and busy body of water between Malaysia to the northeast and Indonesia to the southwest, with the city-state of Singapore at the tip of the Malay Peninsula. The collision is the second involving a ship from the Navy‚Äôs 7th Fleet in the Pacific in two months. Seven sailors died in June when the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship hit each other in waters off Japan. The Fitzgerald‚Äôs captain was relieved of command and other sailors were being punished after the Navy found poor seamanship and flaws in keeping watch contributed to the collision, the Navy announced last week. An investigation into how and why the Fitzgerald collided with the other ship was not finished, but enough details were known to take those actions, the Navy said.

The ship is based at the 7th Fleet‚Äôs homeport of Yokosuka, Japan. It was commissioned in 1994 and has a crew of 23 officers, 24 chief petty officers and 291 enlisted sailors, according the Navy‚Äôs website. The warship is 154 meters (505 feet) in length. The Alnic MC is a 183-meter (600-foot) oil and chemical tanker.

Shapath Bharadwaj wins bronze medal in Junior Shotgun World Cup,"Shapath Bharadwaj won a bronze medal. (Source: Olympic Press Twitter) Shapath Bharadwaj won a bronze medal. (Source: Olympic Press Twitter)

Teenager Shapath Bharadwaj on Sunday won a bronze medal in the double trap event while Lakshay Sheoran and Manisha Keer combined to win a bronze in the mixed team trap competition at the ISSF Junior Shotgun World Cup in Porpetto, Italy. The 15-year old Bharadwaj, from Meerut, shot a 48 in the final to finish behind gold-medal winning Briton James Dedman and Finland‚Äôs Miki Ylonen. Dedman, in fact, smashed his own junior world record in the event, finishing with a final score of 70, while Miki had 66.

Shapath had qualified in second place for the final, shooting 131 out of 150. Ahvar Rizvi had also shot 124 but went down in the shoot-off to the eventual silver medallist Ylonen 2-1, for the sixth and final qualifying spot.

In a quality final field, which, beside the world record holder Dedman, also had Ying Qi of China, who had won a Senior World Cup stage bronze in Acapulco early this year.

Shapath started strongly and was in second position with 13 hits after the first 16 shots in the final, behind Dedman who had 14 hits. He shot 41 out of 50 to assure himself of a medal with Dedman pulling away from the field with 45 hits at that stage.

Meanwhile Miko Ylonen of Finland had slowly made his way up to challenge the leaders. He piped Shapath for the silver at the end of 60 shots, having got 50 hits to Shapath‚Äôs 48.

This was India‚Äôs first medal in the competition apart from the bronze won by Sheoran and Keer in the mixed team trap competition on Saturday, which had the status of a test event. The competition concludes tomorrow with the junior men‚Äôs skeet finals.

Italy have so far dominated the competition winning three gold medals, including the mixed trap test event gold as well as three silver and one bronze medal.

Lakshay and Manisha beat the US pair of Sevin Edward Layer and Emma Lee Williams 34-33 in the bronze medal match. The Indian pair finished fourth among 16 teams in the qualifying, shooting a combined score of 84 out of 100 to make the six-team final rounds.

Italy‚Äôs Emanuele Buccolieri and Maria Palmitessa defeated fellow Italians Alberto Belluzzo and Erica Sessa 41-37 in the gold medal match. The event was billed as a test event.

On the fourth day of competitions, two finals have been scheduled in the junior men‚Äôs double trap and the junior women‚Äôs skeet disciplines.

Bharadwaj had qualified in second place for the final, shooting 131 out of 150.

In the women‚Äôs junior skeet, Areeba Khan and Ganemat Sekhon were 12th and 15th respectively with one more 25-shot round left in qualifying.

A Man of His Times,"This book is primarily a compendium of Kanvinde‚Äôs most important works over these five decades. This book is primarily a compendium of Kanvinde‚Äôs most important works over these five decades.

ACHYUT KANVINDE AKAR

Edited by Tanuja & Sanjay Kanvinde

By Riyaz Tayyibji

Achyut Kanvinde, born in the small village of Achara in Maharashtra, belonged to the first generation of modern Indian architects who returned to practice in India after an education abroad, in their quest to find an appropriate contemporary expression for a young country with a long past.

Contrary to popular belief, modern architectural design did not find its way to the subcontinent on the back of Le Corbusier. A group of young Indian architects including Habib Rehman, Piloo Modi and Achyut Kanvinde had already established a base here with their work. Kanvinde, deeply influenced by the great Walter Gropius, had a strong rationalist orientation and an exposure to engineering and construction, which would profoundly influence the course of Indian architecture in the five decades after independence.

This book is primarily a compendium of Kanvinde‚Äôs most important works over these five decades. The work itself is presented chronologically and their decade-wise grouping subtly brings out the fundamental shifts in Kanvinde‚Äôs work over his incredibly prolific career. Along with the architectural work, which is represented through generously sized drawings (including a marvellous appendix of construction drawings) and photographs, this book also contains the great architects‚Äô own words and writings.

One glimpses a wide array of subjects, from his own work to architectural education, the role of the building professional, and, most engagingly, anecdotes of his experiences with the many great people he worked with. From statesmen like Jawaharlal Nehru, the industrious Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and Dr. Homi Bhabha to the master architects: Gropius, Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. These personal experiences are not only of historical value, but make for enthralling reading for anyone interested in history, architecture or simply the spirit and energy of the time just after 1947. Kanvinde‚Äôs own writings are simple, and deal directly with the problems and solutions pertaining to our built environment. The tone of his writing, as much as their content, gives us insight into the man known for his quiet humility, unequalled generosity and professional commitment.

In order to tell us more about the man, the editors have interspersed a series of essays into the book, written by Kanvinde‚Äôs colleagues, historians and family members, thus creating a background to the work that ranges from the historical to the intimate. However, though an important aspect of the book, this is also, perhaps, its weakest link. The essays are informative, but lack a certain tautness of narrative.

Much more importantly, the book re-produces the work done by Kanvinde at the JJ School of Architecture during his student days. Comprising both sketches and project work, these drawings talk about the predilection and general direction of the country‚Äôs architectural education at the time. The book looks at that historic moment of May 17, 1959, when, at the ‚ÄòSeminar on Architecture‚Äô at Lalit Kala Academy, Kanvinde delivered an address titled ‚ÄòArchitectural Expression and National Policy‚Äô. Kanvinde argued for a functional, technology-driven modern architecture embedded in the society of the day. The historical implications of this event are not lost on the editors of this book as they reproduce Nehru‚Äôs address along with Kanvinde‚Äôs own intimate anecdotes about proceedings.

Modern buildings are rarely ‚Äòpretty‚Äô. Made in bare materials and unadorned by softer finishes, they‚Äôre robust and driven by functional needs. Yet, in the hands of a great architect, like Kanvinde, these buildings have a fierce and powerful beauty. There is a tactile exploration of material, their organisation into evocative structural configurations that allow for a play of light, of inside and outside, of sun and shadow, of movement and gathering. This is an architecture of doing a lot with very little: for a country that had very little. One simply has to turn to page 148 and look at Kanvinde‚Äôs Dudhusagar dairy project for the National Dairy Development Board at Mehsana, to recognise that an industrial building can be given a poetry of form. Balanced horizontals and verticals, the play of raw concrete and white plaster, the power of architectural composition squeezed out from a most pragmatic of requirements.

This book brings out the unparalleled relentlessness with which Kanvinde followed his modernist convictions. An almost spiritual orientation which helped the architect find a deep resonance with the historic architecture of the subcontinent. Though modern in its appearance, his buildings seem to imbibe an age-old understanding of the environment in which he built.

Throughout his career Kanvinde‚Äôs work was in partnership, first with Shaukat Rai, and then with the addition of Murad Chaudhary. This book documents his final decade of practice, which was largely a

personal one. Now, he challenges his rationalist approach with projects that have high symbolic content (temples) and require logic other than function. He responds to these self-set challenges by returning to his roots ‚Äî to his JJ School training and to the poetry of Tukaram. Kanvinde‚Äôs life work is a study of systematic architectural development in search of dissolution and belonging. An architect who takes the impulses and influences from a foreign place and brings them home. This book is a fitting tribute to the journey of India‚Äôs greatest professional, modern architect.

"Pro Kabaddi 2017: Fazel Atrachali playing with dislocated bone, says Gujarat Fortunegiants physiotherapist Olivia Witek","Fazel Atrachali is playing the league with a dislocated bone in his right-hand. Fazel Atrachali is playing the league with a dislocated bone in his right-hand.

Gujarat Fortunegiants may have been dealt a blow after a dream run at home in their debut season of Pro Kabaddi. Their star defender and vice-captain Fazel Atrachali is playing the league with a dislocated bone in his right-hand.

‚ÄúFazel is going through a tough time as he has a dislocated bone in his right hand,‚Äù said Gujarat Fortunegiants chief physiotherapist Olivia Witek. ‚ÄúDuring the match, it hurts him a lot but we are giving him painkillers,‚Äù Olivia said.

When asked about who could be a potential replacement for Fazel if the condition deteriorates, Olivia said, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt put Fazel out of the match. If Fazel is out then the entire team is out. He is one of our key players.‚Äù

In nine matches, Fazel has made 19 successful tackles. While the Iranian has been rock solid in the left corner, he has got support from compatriot Abozar Mighuani. The Fazel-Abozar pair has scored 43 tackle points.

Gujarat will next play U Mumba on August 29 at the NSCI SVP Stadium in Mumbai, giving the 25-year old a well earned seven-day break to recover. ‚ÄúWe at least need one month to completely heal his injury. But with such a tight schedule, we are giving him painkillers and injections whenever there is discomfort,‚Äù she added.

Fazel is the only player in the history of Pro Kabaddi to lift the coveted trophy with two different teams ‚Äì season 2 with U Mumba and season 4 with Patna Pirates.

Gujarat Fortunegiants are the only team in the fifth season, who were unbeaten at home. Their first match at Ahmedabad ended in a win over U Mumba. There after, they went on to register wins over Dabang Delhi, Jaipur Pink Panthers, Bengaluru Bulls and Telugu Titans.

Gujarat Fortunegiants concluded their home leg with a 26-26 draw against Bengal Warriors. They top the Zone A rankings after six wins from nine games.

Spain identifies driver of Barcelona rampage van as hunt continues,"Police put up scores of roadblocks across northeast Spain on Sunday in hopes of capturing a fugitive suspect at large following the vehicle attack. (AP Photo) Police put up scores of roadblocks across northeast Spain on Sunday in hopes of capturing a fugitive suspect at large following the vehicle attack. (AP Photo)

Spanish police said on Monday they had identified the driver of a van that mowed down pedestrians in Barcelona, killing 13, as an international manhunt for the suspect believed to be a Moroccan national deepened. In a tweet, police in Catalonia said they knew who the driver was without naming him, but regional interior minister Joaquim Forn said in a radio interview that ‚Äúeverything suggests the van driver is Younes Abouyaaqoub.‚Äù

The 22-year-old Moroccan is believed to be the last remaining member of a 12-person cell still at large in Spain or abroad, with the others killed by police or detained over last week‚Äôs twin attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils. Investigators have honed in on an imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, aged in his 40s, who is among the suspects and is believed to have radicalised youths in Ripoll, a small town at the foot of the Pyrenees.

Several suspects ‚Äî including Abouyaaqoub ‚Äî grew up or lived there. Police raided more homes there on Monday morning, Forn said.

Police said the imam had spent time in prison and had once been in contact with a suspect wanted on terrorism charges, without giving further details. El Mundo newspaper reported that Satty had struck up a friendship in prison with Rachid Aglif, who is serving an 18-

year sentence over the 2004 Madrid train bomb attacks, which killed 191 people.

Prosecutors in Belgium also said he had spent time in the country, without elaborating. The imam has been missing since Tuesday. On Saturday, police raided his apartment. They have raised the possibility that he died in an explosion on Wednesday evening at a house

believed to be the suspects‚Äô bomb-making factory, where police uncovered a cache of 120 gas canisters.

The suspected jihadists had been preparing bombs for ‚Äúone or more attacks in Barcelona‚Äù, regional police chief Josep Lluis Trapero told reporters, revealing that traces of triacetone triperoxide (TATP) ‚Äî a homemade explosive that is a hallmark of the Islamic State (IS) group ‚Äî had also been found.

The suspects accidentally caused an explosion at the house on the eve of Thursday‚Äôs attack in Barcelona ‚Äî an error that likely forced them to modify their plans. Instead, they used a vehicle to smash into crowds on Barcelona‚Äôs Las Ramblas boulevard as it was thronged with

tourists, killing 13 people and injuring about 100.

Several hours later, a similar attack in the seaside town of Cambrils left one woman dead. Police shot and killed the five attackers in Cambrils, some of whom were wearing fake explosive belts and carrying knives. IS claimed responsibility for the attacks, believed to be

its first in Spain.

A Bollywood Ending,"Designer Manish Malhotra with showstoppers Jacqueline Fernandez and Aditya Roy Kapur. (Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty) Designer Manish Malhotra with showstoppers Jacqueline Fernandez and Aditya Roy Kapur. (Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty)

OVER the weekend, Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 saw a steady parade of Bollywood showstoppers and front-row fixtures. From Aditya Roy Kapur and Jacqueline Fernandez, who walked for Manish Malhotra‚Äôs closing show, to ramp regulars Malaika Arora and Dia Mirza, who walked for newbie designers such as Ridhi Mehra and Kusum and Karishma Luharuwal respectively, a celebrity showstopper was the hottest selling news peg.

Every starlet worth her personal manager ‚Äî from Aditi Rao Hydari, Ileana D‚ÄôCruz, Kriti Sanon, Bhumi Pednekar and Taapsee Pannu, to Diana Penty, Pooja Hegde, Nargis Fakhri, Vaani Kapoor and Eli Avaram ‚Äî was present at Mumbai‚Äôs St Regis, playing arm candy to some designer or the other.

In comparison, the men were under-represented ‚Äî by Randeep Hooda, Vidyut Jamwal and Ali Fazal. But the show-stealer was the inimitable Ranveer Singh, who may not have walked the ramp for Manish Arora, but created quite a flutter in a psychedelic rainbow-hued Arora jumper. The flashbulb frenzy at the venue made even the most seasoned of fashion watchers admit in self-defeat that Mumbai and its obsession with Bollywood will not be denied.

Parisian Affair

Manish Arora, undoubtedly India‚Äôs most famous fashion export, presented ‚ÄúCosmic Love‚Äù, celebrating a decade of showing his work at the Paris Fashion Week. The Fall 2017 line, described by WWD.com as ‚Äúa veritable firework display‚Äù took the atrium of Palladium Mall quite by storm with its psychedelic fervour and multi-coloured madness. African tribal influences met intergalactic patterns, shooting stars and peacock embroideries, as over 40 models descended an escalator directly on to the makeshift ramp ‚Äî a frenzied spectacle only Arora can promise and deliver.

Glamour Galore

Where there is Bollywood, there‚Äôs bound to be glamour. The weekend saw designers pull out all the stops for collections that screamed glitz. The title of Malhotra‚Äôs collection ‚ÄúTales of Indulgence‚Äù was self-explanatory as cocktail dresses in metallic hues were doused in pearls, tassels and feathers. His protege Arpita Mehta presented a coquettish festive line with bare shoulders, lotus motifs and lots of sheer styles. Ridhi Mehra played with fringe details, metallic tassels, bugle beads, faux feathers and plunging necklines to turn the heat up a notch.

While Shriya Som brought on a more vintage vibe with intricate lace, feathers, stones, sequins and crystals, Sonaakshi Raaj worked with embellished and gilded lace, shimmery thread-work and blingy fringe. In comparison, Nachiket Barve‚Äôs Greco-Roman inspired line was rich in colour, yet understated. With collections bordering more on the commercial rather than the abstruse, we won‚Äôt be surprised if some of the outfits displayed make the ramp-to-red-carpet transition even before we can say ‚ÄúFarewell, fashion week‚Äù.

Unwavering Donald Trump voters say they will not miss Steve Bannon,"Before hitching himself to Donald Trump, Steve Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a hard-right site. (Source: Reuters/File Photo) Before hitching himself to Donald Trump, Steve Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a hard-right site. (Source: Reuters/File Photo)

Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon‚Äôs firing has been met with a collective shrug by some of President Donald Trump‚Äôs most committed supporters who argue the controversial nationalist became an obstacle to the administration‚Äôs agenda.

In interviews in multiple cities this weekend, Americans who voted for Trump said Bannon‚Äôs departure on Friday was the removal of an unnecessary distraction for the Trump presidency, while others saw his role as largely inconsequential and possibly overblown. Many expected Trump to stay the course without him.

‚ÄúBannon was becoming too big of a story and taking the spotlight from President Trump,‚Äù Bob Janda, a 67-year-old small business owner, said in a bar in Chicago. ‚ÄúWhen that happens, your days are numbered. I think Trump will be fine.‚Äù

At the same bar, Frank Cardone, 67, pointed out that Bannon had a brief tenure in Trump‚Äôs inner circle, having joined the Republican businessman‚Äôs presidential campaign as its chief executive less than three months before the Nov. 8 election. ‚ÄúBannon wasn‚Äôt with Trump for too long so it‚Äôs no big loss,‚Äù said Cardone, a retired electrician.

Before hitching himself to Trump, Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a hard-right site. He immediately returned to that role after his exit from the White House, vowing to use it as a platform to defend Trump. Bannon, 63, has touted Breitbart as a conservative counterpoint to what he views as the liberal bias of U.S. news outlets and a platform for the so-called alt-right, a loose confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.

He played a key role in some of Trump‚Äôs most contentious policy moves including the travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations, departure from the Paris climate accord and rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Bannon‚Äôs exit gives Trump a chance to distance himself from ‚Äúfringe‚Äù politics, said Mike Corbitt, a machinist from Florida‚Äôs West Palm Beach.

‚ÄúHe (Trump) needs to be more center-right because the far right and the far left is not where America is,‚Äù Corbitt, 48, said at a Fort Lauderdale bar. ‚ÄúSteve Bannon was great for getting Trump elected, but now the president needs someone who can get his policies enacted.‚Äù

Bannon joined a string of senior officials who have left the Trump administration in the past five weeks, leading to the appointment of retired Marine general John Kelly as the new White House chief of staff. While some observers have characterized the moves as a sign of chaos in the White House, others see it as a sign that Trump is running his administration like a well-oiled corporation.

‚ÄúAll these shakeups mean is that Trump is doing his job,‚Äù Liz Lingafelter, a 60-year-old nurse, said in Fort Lauderdale. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a businessman and is doing what‚Äôs best for the organization.‚Äù That view was echoed by Rick Weatherly, a 61-year-old Denver maintenance technician. ‚ÄúI voted for Trump, not Bannon,‚Äù he said.

"There are such great batsmen in our side that anyone can take my place, says Shikhar Dhawan","Shikhar Dhawan scored unbeaten 132 runs against Sri Lanka. (Source: AP) Shikhar Dhawan scored unbeaten 132 runs against Sri Lanka. (Source: AP)

Despite hitting a purple patch in recent times, India opener Shikhar Dhawan is not thinking of being complacent as there are many ‚Äúgreat batsmen‚Äù in the Indian side that can take his place. He also remembers the hard times when he was out of the time and said that failures have taught him a lot.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long time (until the next World Cup). I would like to keep performing well. That would be my goal because if I don‚Äôt perform, there are such great batsmen in our side that anyone can take my place,‚Äù Dhawan said after taking India to win over Sri Lanka. ‚ÄúFailure teaches you a lot and I am lucky I have learnt so much out of that,‚Äù he added.

Dhawan scored a 71-ball century, his fastest in ODIs, against Sri Lanka on Sunday and guided India to a big nine-wicket win. He did not enjoy a good time last year and was dropped from the team after New Zealand series. But, he was selected for the Championships Trophy and there he got his touch back.

‚ÄúI have already had a slump so I don‚Äôt think about it. When it has to come it will come. I embrace that period of slump also. When I was not doing well I was just focussing on my processes. And when I am doing well, I am still focussing on my processes. So those things don‚Äôt bother me that much,‚Äù Dhawan said.

The opener narrated that it was a similar case from 2013 where he was out of the team before making a comeback for the Champions Trophy in 2013 and like this year‚Äôs tournament he played fluently in that edition.

‚ÄúWhen I made a comeback in the ODI side in 2013 Champions Trophy, I was batting this fluently. Even in recent Champions Trophy (2017), I was playing in that flow. I would say that I even played like this in my debut Test match against Australia, or like I played in Galle in the first Test here. I am playing quite similarly to those times. I am trying to keep repeating the same mantra for myself,‚Äù he said.

The 31-year-old has been in some stellar form on this tour. In the fourt Test innings, he made two centuries and now in one ODI, he has a century. But for Dhawan, run scoring doesn‚Äôt seem a problem. He is more bothered about the fitness as there are more players in the team who are attaining supreme fitness.

‚ÄúI like to keep myself fit at the pace of the game. Apart from that I don‚Äôt really too many goals that I have to score these many runs. I just focus on my process including my fitness, skills and fielding,‚Äù he said.

Talking about Sunday‚Äôs match, Dhawan said he did not think much about the pitch. Dhawan made 132 runs and even added 197 runs the second wicket with Virat Kohli.

‚ÄúI really didn‚Äôt think about the pitch. I was just watching the ball and playing the ball. And I felt that the pitch was very good, the way Sri Lanka started the innings. I thought they will score 300 runs but they lost lot of wickets in the middle and we dominated the game,‚Äù said Dhawan.

Sri Lanka haven‚Äôt given India any competition so far and even lost the first ODI in just 28.5 overs. They were blanked 3-0 in the Test series. Despite this, Dhawan said that this is young Sri Lanka side and will take time to get better.

‚ÄúThis is a young Sri Lankan side and they are in transition period where all the boys will mature. In international cricket you need to have that experience. The young boys are good but with time they will get better.‚Äù

‚ÄúMalinga has been a legend for Sri Lankan cricket and he has done great in international cricket in all formats. He is a bit old now and with time I feel that his pace has gone down a bit. That‚Äôs why we can attack more as batsmen and that‚Äôs what we look at. This is natural because he has played so much cricket. It‚Äôs just a cycle, life cycle, that‚Äôs what I feel,‚Äù said the left-handed opener.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use those harsh words. I won‚Äôt say they are the worst bowling attack I have faced. The left arm bowler (Vishwa Fernando) bowls decent pace. They have a good fast bowling attack. In Champions Trophy, they even beat us.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that we have got a mature side, very experienced side so that plays a huge role because how you handle pressure situations that matters a lot with experience. So I feel that with time Sri Lankan team will do well,‚Äù he added.

Manchester United‚Äôs Paul Pogba is the world‚Äôs best midfield player and has the potential to win the Ballon d‚ÄôOr in the next five years, the Frenchman‚Äôs club and national team mate Anthony Martial has said.

Pogba, who rejoined United from Juventus in 2016, scored five goals and provided four assists in 30 Premier League appearances last campaign.

The 24-year-old has started the current season strongly with two goals and an assist in the first two league matches and Martial believes his compatriot can reach the next level and become the best footballer in the world.

‚ÄúPaul is very mentally strong and he is very sure of himself,‚Äù Martial told United‚Äôs website (www.manutd.com).‚ÄùHe is a big guy, he is very technical on the ball and he has lots of endurance. I would say he is probably the best midfield player in the world.

‚ÄúHe is still young, too, so he has a lot to work on and he can get even better‚Ä¶ If he continues to play and improve like he is doing then I think he is also going to win the Ballon d‚ÄôOr award in the next five years.‚Äù

Martial, who has scored two goals in as many league games this season, also praised Pogba‚Äôs attributes off the pitch and said the duo are targeting silverware at both domestic and national tournaments.

‚ÄúWe want to win a lot of trophies together at United, and we also want to win the World Cup with France,‚Äù the 21-year-old added. The United duo will be looking to extend their flying start to the campaign when the club host Leicester City at Old Trafford on Saturday.

"In 3-2 verdict, SC walks fine line, strikes down instant triple talaq","Under talaq ahsan, a Muslim man can divorce his spouse by pronouncing talaq once every month in three consecutive months and this would be signified by menstruation cycles. Under talaq ahsan, a Muslim man can divorce his spouse by pronouncing talaq once every month in three consecutive months and this would be signified by menstruation cycles.

In a landmark 3-2 verdict, the Supreme Court on Tuesday ‚Äúset aside‚Äù the centuries-old practice of instant triple talaq or talaq-e-biddat in which Muslim men divorce their wives by uttering talaq three times in quick succession. Three of the five judges on the Constitution Bench ‚Äî Justices Rohinton F Nariman, Uday U Lalit and Kurian Joseph ‚Äî called the practice un-Islamic and ‚Äúarbitrary‚Äù and disagreed with the view that triple talaq was an integral part of religious practice. But the minority ruling of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice S Abdul Nazeer underlined the primacy of Muslim personal law and said the practice enjoyed constitutional protection and was beyond the scope of judicial scrutiny. They were of the view that Parliament should consider an ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù law to deal with the issue of talaq-e-biddat.

Justice Joseph, who disagreed that triple talaq had constitutional protection, reiterated the Shamim Ara ruling in which it was held that triple talaq lacked legal sanctity: ‚ÄúWhat is held to be bad in the Holy Quran cannot be good in Shariat and, in that sense, what is bad in theology is bad in law as well.‚Äù

The 395-page judgment, on a clutch of petitions by Muslim women challenging the validity of instant triple talaq, comprised three separate rulings ‚Äî Chief Justice Khehar wrote for himself and Justice Nazeer, Justice Nariman for himself and Justice Lalit while Justice Joseph came out with his own order. The verdict was immediately welcomed by the government, political parties, activists and the petitioners, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailing it as ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù and saying it has granted equality to Muslim women.

Justice Joseph said: ‚ÄúI find it extremely difficult to agree with the learned Chief Justice that the practice of triple talaq has to be considered integral to the religious denomination in question and that the same is part of their personal law‚Ä¶ on the statement that triple talaq is an integral part of the religious practice, I respectfully disagree. Merely because a practice has continued for long, that by itself cannot make it valid if it has been expressly declared to be impermissible.‚Äù

He disagreed with the minority verdict which held that though triple talaq was part of religion, its operation can be stayed (injuncted) under Article 142 (extraordinary power of the SC) for six months to enable the State to frame a law to deal with it. ‚ÄúI also have serious doubts as to whether, even under Article 142, the exercise of a Fundamental Right can be injuncted,‚Äù he said.

Justice Nariman too wrote that triple talaq did not satisfy the test laid down by the Supreme Court to decide whether a practice was integral to the practice of a faith. ‚ÄúApplying the test of manifest arbitrariness‚Ä¶ it is clear that triple talaq is a form of talaq which is itself considered to be something innovative, namely, that it is not in the Sunna, being an irregular or heretical form of talaq‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶it is clear that this form of talaq is manifestly arbitrary in the sense that the marital tie can be broken capriciously and whimsically by a Muslim man without any attempt at reconciliation so as to save it. This form of talaq must, therefore, be held to be violative of the fundamental right contained under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In our opinion, therefore, the 1937 Act, insofar as it seeks to recognise and enforce triple talaq, is within the meaning of the expression ‚Äòlaws in force‚Äô in Article 13(1) and must be struck down as being void to the extent that it recognises and enforces triple talaq,‚Äù Justice Nariman wrote.

PTI adds: With triple talaq being set aside, now Sunni Muslims, among whom triple talaq was prevalent, will not be able to take recourse to this mode as it would be ‚Äúvoid ab initio‚Äù (illegal at the outset). They are now left with two other modes of securing divorce ‚Äî talaq hasan and talaq ahsan after the apex court set aside the talaq-e-biddat.

Under talaq ahsan, a Muslim man can divorce his spouse by pronouncing talaq once every month in three consecutive months and this would be signified by menstruation cycles. As per talaq hasan, divorce can be given by pronouncing talaq ‚Äúduring successive tuhrs (menstruation cycle)‚Äù with no intercourse during any of the three tuhrs.

Death toll in DR Congo landslide climbs to 140,"Fishing on Lake Albert is one of the main occupations in Ituri, which borders Uganda. Fishing on Lake Albert is one of the main occupations in Ituri, which borders Uganda.

The death toll from a landslide that swept over a fishing village on the banks of a lake in the Democratic Republic of Congo has reached 140, the government said today. ‚ÄúWe estimate that there at least a hundred bodies buried underneath the rumble of large rocks that fell on the 48 destroyed homes,‚Äù the deputy governor of Ituri Province, Pacifique Keta, told AFP.

The landslide occurred last Wednesday in the northeast village of Tora on the banks of Lake Albert when part of a mountain engulfed a fishing camp after heavy rains. At the time, the government said 40 people had died. Keta said authorities have decided to suspend the search for bodies to ‚Äúprioritise the disinfection of the area‚Äù ‚Äî a measure designed to prevent the spreading of possible diseases to nearby fishing villages.

Fishing on Lake Albert is one of the main occupations in Ituri, which borders Uganda. The vast country has experienced several similar disasters, including a mudslide in May 2010 that killed 19 people, though the bodies of 27 others were never recovered. In February 2002, about 50 people were found dead after a wave of mud and rocks hit the eastern town of Uvira, submerging about 150 homes.

"Earthquake hits Italian island, buildings collapse","Debris lie on a road after an earthquake hit the island of Ischia, near Naples, Southern Italy, Monday, Aug. 21, 2017.(Mauro Iovino/ANSA via AP) Debris lie on a road after an earthquake hit the island of Ischia, near Naples, Southern Italy, Monday, Aug. 21, 2017.(Mauro Iovino/ANSA via AP)

An earthquake measuring 3.6 magnitude hit the island of Ischia, off the coast of Naples, on Monday night, officials said, and first reports said one person was killed and at least 20 people injured in the collapse of several buildings.

Residents and tourists on the island, which is crowded at the height of the summer season, ran out on to the streets from homes and hospitals.

Television images showed that about six buildings in the town of Casamicciola as well as a church had collapsed in the quake, which hit at 8:57 p.m. (1857 GMT).

Roberto Allocca, a doctor from a local hospital, told Sky TG24 television that at least 20 people had been treated for minor injuries. Most of the hospital had been evacuated and the injured were treated outside. Media reports said one woman was killed when she was hit by falling rubble from a church.

Civil protection squads were already on the island because of brushfires and more were arriving from the mainland.

The television reports said the buildings that collapsed appeared to have been inhabited and a number of people were still unaccounted for.

Saudi carrier says Qatar has not approved hajj flights,"A file photo of a Saudi Airlines carrier. A file photo of a Saudi Airlines carrier.

Saudi Arabia said Sunday its aircraft have not been given permission to land in Doha to pick up Qatari pilgrims for the annual hajj after the king authorized flights to transport people to Mecca. Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar last week to allow Qataris to attend the hajj amid a monthslong rift between the neighboring countries. King Salman also authorized Saudi planes to transport pilgrims at his expense. Already, more than 100 Qataris have crossed into Saudi Arabia since the border was opened.

But Saleh al-Jasser, the general manger of Saudi Arabian Airlines, was quoted by Saudi state TV as saying Qatari authorities have not authorized the kingdom‚Äôs aircraft to land in the capital, despite a request submitted several days ago to transport Qatari pilgrims from Hamad International Airport in Doha.

Qatar‚Äôs foreign minister said his country welcomed the decision to facilitate the hajj for Qataris, however the moves do not appear to have been coordinated with Qatar‚Äôs government.

In early June, Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar‚Äôs only land border. The kingdom, along with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt also cut all diplomatic and transport links with Qatar, including barring direct flights between the countries. They also blocked Qatari flights from using their airspace.

The four countries accuse Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and of trying to foment unrest in the region. They have tried for years to pressure Qatar to stop supporting Islamist opposition groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. Qatar rejects the allegation that it backs extremist groups and says the moves are politically motivated.

The Qatar-based Al Jazeera reported that the small Gulf country filed a complaint to the International Civil Aviation Organization against attempts to ‚Äúterrorize‚Äù travelers flying on Qatari Airways. The complaint pointed to a report by the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news channel that shows a simulation of a fighter jet forcing a Qatar Airways flight to land if it enters the quartet‚Äôs airspace. The video says that these countries have the right to use force if necessary, and shows a bomb striking an unmarked aircraft.

Saudi Arabia‚Äôs facilitation of the hajj for Qataris came after a visit to the kingdom by a Qatari royal family member who resides outside Qatar and whose branch of the family was ousted in a coup more than four decades ago.

Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani, who holds no official post in Qatar, also met Saudi King Salman at his summer palace in Morocco over the weekend and launched a verified Twitter account to raise his profile. He has since taken credit for setting up a hotline inside Saudi Arabia for Qataris who require additional assistance during the hajj, which starts at the end of the month.

Sheikh Abdullah used his new Twitter account Sunday to express his disappointment over Saudi aircraft not being given permission to pick up Qatari pilgrims. ‚ÄúI hope the brothers in Qatar cooperate to facilitate the pilgrimage of citizens,‚Äù he wrote.

"US warship Indianapolis found 18,000 feet deep in Pacific Ocean","The World War II cruiser USS Indianapolis which was lost July 30, 1945 is seen at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in 1937. (Source: Reuters) The World War II cruiser USS Indianapolis which was lost July 30, 1945 is seen at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in 1937. (Source: Reuters)

Researchers have found the wreckage of the U.S. warship Indianapolis, which was sunk by a Japanese torpedo in the final days of World War Two, more than 18,000 feet (5.5 kilometers) below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, the Navy said on Saturday. The cruiser was returning from its mission to deliver components for the atomic bomb that would soon be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima when it was fired upon in the North Pacific Ocean by a Japanese submarine on July 30, 1945.

It sunk in 12 minutes, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington. No distress signal was sent. About 800 of the 1,196 crew members aboard survived the sinking, but only 316 were rescued alive five days later, with the rest lost to exposure, dehydration, drowning and sharks.

After a Navy historian unearthed new information in 2016 about the warship‚Äôs last movements that pointed to a new search area, a team of civilian researchers led by Paul Allen, a Microsoft Corp co-founder, spent months searching in a 600-square-mile (1,500-square-kilometer) patch of ocean.

With a vessel rigged with equipment that can reach some of the deepest ocean floors, members of Allen‚Äôs team found the wreckage somewhere in the Philippine Sea on Friday, Allen said in a statement on his website. The statement said the Navy had asked Allen to keep the precise location confidential.

Allen said that the discovery was a humbling experience and a means of honoring sailors he saw as playing a vital role in ending World War Two. ‚ÄúWhile our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,‚Äù he said. Identification was easier than in some deep-sea expeditions: some of the exposed wreck was clearly marked with Indianapolis signage, according to photographs shared by Allen and the Navy.

‚ÄúIt is exceedingly rare you find the name of the ship on a piece of the wreckage,‚Äù Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the Naval History and Heritage Command, said in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs not Indianapolis then I don‚Äôt know what is.‚Äù

The Navy said it had plans to honor the 22 survivors from the Indianapolis still alive along with the families of the ship‚Äôs crew.

"Rishang Keishing, Manipur‚Äôs grand old leader passes away","India‚Äôs oldest Parliamentarian Rishang Keishing, who was a member of the First Lok Sabha in 1952, dies aged 97. (Express Photo: Renuka Puri) India‚Äôs oldest Parliamentarian Rishang Keishing, who was a member of the First Lok Sabha in 1952, dies aged 97. (Express Photo: Renuka Puri)

Rishang Keishing, the grand old man of Manipur, who had also served as an MLA for seven terms, apart from having become chief minister of the state four times, passed away at the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Imphal, on Tuesday evening. He was 97. He was a member of the first Lok Sabha in 1952. When he retired from public life in 2014, he had just completed his term as member of the Rajya Sabha.

Born to Rungdi Keishing and Mungshing Keishing of Bungpa Khunou village in the present-day Ukhrul district of Manipur on October 25, 1920, Rishang had begun his career as a primary school teacher in his native village when he was just 16. But, after quitting that job, he attended as many as three high schools ‚Äì at Imphal, Kohima and finally at Jorhat, from where he passed his Matriculation in 1945. As a college student in Kolkata, he not only saw India become independent (Manipur was then a princely state), but also came into contact with Birendra Kumar Bhattacharyya ‚Äì a Socialist activist who later became a well-known author and won the Jnanpith ‚Äì whom he took to Ukhrul to teach science in the Ukhrul Christian Junior High School to teach science. Rishang himself became headmaster after upgrading it to a high school, but had to quit that job to contest and get elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1952 as a candidate of the Socialist Party.

Since then, there was no looking back for Rishang Keishing, a man who had not only witnessed the journey of India through seven long decades since Independence, but also became an active player ‚Äì though on the government side ‚Äì in Naga politics that had turned increasingly violent through as years passed. He continued to win the next two Lok Sabha elections from Manipur Outer constituency in 1957 and 1962 as a Socialist Party candidate, until in 1964, he joined the Congress party at the invitation of Jawaharlal Nehru.

After Manipur became a full-fledged state in 1972, Keishing returned to state politics, and got elected to the state assembly from Phungyar, an assembly segment which he represented for seven terms till 2002. While he first became a minister in 1975, he was sworn in as chief minister of Manipur for the first time on November 27, 1980, an office which he occupied as many as four times between 1980 and 1997. While his first stint as chief minister lasted only 92 days, his longest innings was for six years and 258 days (1981 to 1988) during which he also steered the Congress party successfully through an assembly election.

In 2002, Keishing was elected to Rajya Sabha from the lone Manipur seat, and was re-elected in 2008, and as he walked out of Parliament House in February 2014, he not only became the oldest member of the House, but also became the only MP from the first Lok Sabha to have remained in Parliament till such a ripe age of 94. His term as Rajya Sabha member in fact came to an end on April 9, 2014. ‚ÄúI have had enough. I‚Äôm glad to go,‚Äù Keishing had told The Indian Express as he walked out of Parliament on February 20, 2014, but not before ruing that the standard of debates and discussions in Parliament had deteriorated in front of his eyes. ‚ÄúI am sad that Parliament now is not what it used to be. It‚Äôs only shouting and shouting. MPs now are like trade union leaders, they come here only to demand this and demand that. This is not the Parliament I knew,‚Äù he had said.

Living hero: Rishang Keishing, whose native district Ukhrul had also sent up Thiungaleng Muivah, the general secretary of NSCN(IM), had not only seen the rise of the Naga separatist movement from close quarters, but had also remained the hero of ‚ÄòYaruingam‚Äô ‚Äì one of the most celebrated Assamese novels. Written by Birendra Kumar Bhattacharyya, his closest friend of college days in Kolkata who later also went to teach Science in his village high school, ‚ÄòYaruingam‚Äô is the story of the rise of the Naga movement in the Naga-inhabited hills of Manipur told through the life of none other than Rishang Keishing.

Keishing in fact appears in the novel in his real name, and so also his wife Khatingla, with the story woven around two youth from the same place ‚Äì a former INA soldier Vidashali secretly forming an army to fight for a sovereign Naga state, and Rishang, an educated youth influenced by the ideas of love, peace, tolerance and education as preached by the Christian missionaries and Mahatma Gandhi.

Older adults more concerned about privacy on Facebook,"Family members encourage older adults to join Facebook, but they stay away due to privacy issues. (Source: File Photo) Family members encourage older adults to join Facebook, but they stay away due to privacy issues. (Source: File Photo)

When it comes to privacy on Facebook, older adults are more suspicious about who is viewing their posts and this may deter them from using the social networking platform, say researchers led by an Indian-origin professor.

In a study of older people‚Äôs perception of Facebook by the team from Pennsylvania State University, participants listed keeping in touch, monitoring other‚Äôs updates and sharing photos as main reasons for using Facebook.

However, the elderly listed privacy as well as the triviality of some posts as reasons they stay away from the site. ‚ÄúThe biggest concern is privacy and it‚Äôs not about revealing too much, it‚Äôs that they assume that too many random people out there can get their hands on their information,‚Äù said S. Shyam Sundar, Professor, Media Effects Research Laboratory at the Pennsylvania State University.

The researchers, who report their findings in a forthcoming issue of the journal Telematics and Informatics, said Facebook developers should focus on privacy settings to tap into the seniors market. They also suggested that Facebook is helping to serve as a communications bridge between the generations and young people are prompting their older family members to join the social networking site.

‚ÄúIn particular, unlike younger people, most older adults were encouraged by younger family members to join Facebook so that they could communicate,‚Äù added Eun Hwa Jung, Assistant Professor of communications and new media, National University of Singapore.

‚ÄúThis implies that older adults‚Äô interaction via social networking sites can contribute to effective inter-generational communication,‚Äù Jung added. The researchers recruited a small group of participants who were between 65 and 95 years old to take part in in-depth interviews.

If participants had a Facebook account, researchers asked them about their experience and their motivations for joining. Participants who did not use Facebook were asked why they did not join. Because all of the participants in this study lived in a retirement home, the researchers said that future research should look at the perception and use of Facebook by seniors who live alone.

"If I had the opportunity to play with modern bats, I would have done so, says Sanath Jayasuriya","Sanath Jayasuriya (L) is now the chief selector of Sri Lanka. (Source: AP) Sanath Jayasuriya (L) is now the chief selector of Sri Lanka. (Source: AP)

Sanath Jayasuriya, along with Romesh Kaluwitharana, redefined the art of opening in limited-overs in the 1990s. The former Sri Lanka captain, now the chief selector, played with 2.6-2.7 pounds bat with thin edges. He talks to The Indian Express on ICC‚Äôs bat-dimension regulations, besides some of the issues plaguing Sri Lankan cricket.

Do you think modern bats have made the game lopsided? And has the ICC done the right thing by ringing in restrictions?

Time to time, bats have changed. Bat manufacturers come up with different ideas to give their products an advantage, to show the world that they‚Äôre better than the others. So they have been trying lots of things. Recently, they have been having thick edges with a lot of wood, but still they managed to keep a nice weight. We need to strike the right balance. The changes are for everyone, which is good. Umpires will come to the dressing room and check, which is a good thing.

What were the dimensions of your bat?

When I was playing, the only thing that mattered to me was a lighter bat and making sure I get the proper wood. We never thought anything about bat dimensions. Whatever the manufacturers did, we used to play. It all depended on the manufacturers. In countries where pitches had higher bounce, I used to have more meat at the top half of the bat. In the subcontinent, the bottom half used to be heavier. It was like that only, when we were playing. We never got worried about the thickness and edges. In fact, I always preferred thinner edges (to keep the bat to 2.6-2.7 pounds).

David Warner‚Äôs bat depth is 85mm for limited-overs cricket and he isn‚Äôt supportive of the change. He feels a lot of high-scoring matches are due to benign pitches. Do you agree?

Still, at the same time, you need to have a proper bat in terms of having the right balance between bat and ball. If you have more thickness or huge edges, it‚Äôs a big advantage to the batters.

Do you agree that pitches have generally become flatter?

In Test cricket, home teams prepare pitches according to their strengths. In ODIs and T20s, maybe spectators want to see high-scoring matches, which is why flatter pitches are prepared. When we played, the character of pitches used to vary significantly, from the subcontinent to England to Australia. Now I think, leaving aside the basic differences like higher bounce or lower bounce etc, wickets more or less follow a similar pattern in limited-overs cricket.

You, along with Romesh Kaluwitharana, redefined limited-overs opening batting without the advantage of modern-day bats. How do you explain this?

Mostly I would have got the best bats from the manufacturer. You need to have confidence in your bats. I played with Kookaburra, Reebok, SG, and I also used have bats from a guy from New Zealand, a private bat manufacturer. My bat handles used to be thin and the bottom of the handle was oval-shaped. That gave confidence to my hands. And I always watched the ball. My batting was basically hand-eye coordination, bat speed and timing.

You spoke about having thin bat handles. Did you prefer it because of your grip?

I gripped very hard, both hands very tight. I kept my hands pretty close and I gripped it right under the handle.

Did it allow you to play more shots square of the wicket?

Yes, cut and pull are easier. It helped me play the short ball better. But I could also hit through mid-on and mid-off.

The Jayasuriya-Kaluwitharana show started in Australia before the 1996 World Cup. What was the thought process behind such aggressive batting?

We had similar ways of batting right from our school days (different schools). Duleep Mendis, Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda de Silva had seen us playing attacking cricket at club level. So they gave us the licence to go out there and hit even in international cricket. The idea was to set the platform for a big score with quick-fire opening.

Did you change your batting approach and technique depending on conditions?

I didn‚Äôt change much. We played positive cricket everywhere. Some modifications were required, like while playing in England, focus was more on playing straight. Australia was easier, because pitches there had more bounce.

Coming to modern cricket, we have Warner and Chris Gayle, who are aggressive. How do you assess their batting?

They are attacking cricketers by nature. And even though they are very attacking cricketers, they always aim for big hundreds.

Do you agree modern bats helped their game?

Yes, modern bats have helped. But at the same time, you need to think and play. Because, it‚Äôs not only the bat and the wood. If you don‚Äôt watch the ball and hit properly, you will get out. But yes, with these modern bats, mishits can go for a boundary or a six. That‚Äôs why I said what the ICC did is good for everyone.

Any possibility of mishits going over the rope during your time?

Very rare. We didn‚Äôt have the advantage of such thick edges. But if I had the opportunity to play with these modern bats, I would have obviously picked one. It gives you a lot of confidence ‚Äî top edge going for a six.

After the restrictions, do you see totals coming down gradually, especially in T20s?

Bat manufacturers are creative people. They will come up with some other ideas to make up for this. But now I think the ability to time the ball would be important.

In Sri Lanka, several former cricketers join politics and then come to cricket administration. In India, the Lodha Committee recommendations have encouraged former players to come into administration but politicians were kept at an arm‚Äôs length. How do you look at it?

Different countries look at it differently. Earlier, we used to have interim committees. Now we have returned to a democratically elected system. But former cricketers coming into administration is good for the game.

Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs better to not have political influence in sport?

As I told you, the system in Sri Lanka is different. Our sports law allows this. The only thing I want as a former cricketer is the game to be run properly.

But the Sri Lankan board has never been one of the best-run bodies in the world, affected by turmoil and government interventions.

You can‚Äôt say that. The cricketers have been provided with everything. Administration is separate. There had been ups and downs. There were ups and downs in Indian board also. There‚Äôs stability in the Sri Lankan board (now). The only thing is, when you are not doing well, people come and talk. When this team was winning against Australia one year ago, did you hear anything? We have to face this. We are always open to constructive criticisms. These are difficult times.

Are you disappointed with the way Arjuna Ranatunga is constantly criticising Sri Lankan cricket?

He is a former captain. He has the right to express his opinion. It is for me to decide whether it is correct or not. From August last year up till now, we had 24 players injured.

Has the Sri Lankan board chalked out a plan to take the game to the grassroots?

Now we have spread the game to all provinces. The current president wants the provincial tournament to be on top. The process has been initiated. But it will take some time to get the desired results.

Lines are forming, prices are rising and shelves are emptying as people scurry to obtain special eyewear to view the sun Monday as it is obscured by the passing moon. Complicating the rising demand from last-minute shoppers was a recent recall by Amazon that forced libraries and health centers around the country to recall glasses they gave away or sold.

For stores that still have the glasses, prices are spiking. The ones still for sale on Amazon were going for steep prices Friday, around $11 $12 each.

Nancy West, a 67-year-old retired nurse from Utah, was delighted to be among the final people to get glasses Thursday before the Clark Planetarium in Salt Lake City ran out. It sold nearly 90,000 pairs at $2 each this week. ‚ÄúI will never see a total eclipse again because I will not live long enough,‚Äù West said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an opportunity to understand how our universe works and what part I play in that.‚Äù

Amy Watts and her 13-year-old son, Ethan, waited in line for an hour at the planetarium so they could have a safe way to watch the historic moment. ‚ÄúWe heard the frenzy of getting ahold of some eclipse glasses so we thought, ‚ÄòWhat the heck, we‚Äôll give it a shot,'‚Äù said Watts, a health coach. ‚ÄúWe actually scored some.‚Äù

Doctors around the US launched campaigns this summer to warn people that they can damage their eyes staring directly at the sun, even the slimmest sliver of it. They advised people to get special eclipseglasses. The American Astronomical Society put out a list of 15 approved manufacturers.

Doctors say people who don‚Äôt have the glasses can look indirectly with a pinhole projector ‚Äî which can be made from a shoebox ‚Äî that casts images of the eclipsed sun onto a screen at least 3 feet away. NASA also has a webpage listing safety tips for how to view the eclipse. One of the approved manufacturers selling the special glasses, American Paper Optics, has sold 45 million pairs over the last two years ‚Äî 10 million since mid-July, said John Jerit, president of the Memphis, Tennessee-based company.

Among their customers was Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which had to recall 8,000 glasses purchased from an unidentified third-party vendor and given out at a county fair last weekend. The center was offering people the chance to exchange the faulty glasses for new, certified ones from American Paper Optics Friday through Monday.

The scramble was on even for those not affected by recalls. The Boise Public Library started giving out free eclipse glasses August 1. With lines of eager eclipse-watchers stretching out the door, the main branch ran out in about 15 minutes, spokesman Kevin Winslow said.

The rest of the Boise library branches also ran out quickly: the entire supply of more than 2,000 glasses was gone in under an hour. ‚ÄúWe got about a dozen calls in the last hour asking if we still had them,‚Äù Winslow said Thursday. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling people, ‚ÄòIf you have a family of three or four, not everyone has to have their own pair ‚Äî you can pass it around.'‚Äù

"Ludhiana City Center Scam closure report: 10 years on, Vigilance Bureau tears into own inquiry report","Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh. (Express File Photo by Kamleshwar Singh) Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh. (Express File Photo by Kamleshwar Singh)

A DECADE later, the Punjab vigilance bureau (VB), tearing into its own inquiry report of 2007 in the alleged Rs 1,144-crore Ludhiana city center scam, has flayed the earlier inquiry in a closure report submitted in court Saturday. Rebutting the 2007 inquiry, the closure report gives point-wise ‚Äòreplies‚Äô to the accusations levelled against the accused, including Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, his son Raninder Singh, son-in-law Raminder Singh and others.

The inquiry in 2007 was conducted by IGP-and-director, VB, and later completed by a team of three SPs under the supervision of DIG (VB). The then SP (vigilance), Ludhiana, Kanwarjit Singh Sandhu, on the basis of enquiry, filed an FIR on March 23, 2007. The two reports (2007 and 2017) submitted in court are contradictory and the closure report goes on to say that accusations levelled against the accused in the chargesheet are ‚Äúnon-existent.‚Äù

The 2007 inquiry report says, ‚ÄúLoss to the exchequer and wrongful gain to M/S Today Homes is estimated at Rs 1,500-3,000 crore at least. Enquiries conducted by the officers of VB, pursual of relevant documents and evidence and pursual of relevant files of the local bodies department show that the persons culpable for the various offences committed are Captain Amarinder Singh, former CM, Punjab, Jagjit Singh, former minister‚Ä¶‚Äù (and others). The closure report, however, said, ‚ÄúThere is no solid evidence to say there was any financial loss in the project. There is no proof of any bungling or scam. It is all fictional and doubtful.‚Äù

The inquiry says Captain Amarinder Singh allegedly removed former chairman of Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) Ashok Singh Garcha because he wanted to ‚Äòfit‚Äô a close aide, said Paramjit Singh Sibia. But the closure report says, ‚ÄúGarcha was removed by Captain on the basis of suspicion that he was going to form a new political party. There is no proof that Captain wanted to ‚Äòfit‚Äô his close aide Sibia.‚ÄùThe enquiry says that ‚Äúas per Garcha‚Äôs statement, the Congress wanted funding of Rs 100 crore for Punjab polls from this project‚Äù and that ‚Äúhe got a call from Jagjit Singh saying that project should be announced urgently as per the desire of the government.‚Äù

The closure report says that this allegation is also ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù because ‚Äúno document proof has been found for the same.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe case file is completely mum on this,‚Äù it adds. The inquiry says that three representatives of Today Homes were ‚Äúfilmed agreeing to accept black money for sale of fraudulently procured property.‚Äù The closure report says that the police ‚Äúnever got the original CD‚Äù and that one in its record cannot be ‚Äúcounted as evidence‚Äù because ‚Äúthere is no report of its forensic testing and authenticity record.‚Äù

The inquiry says Captain Amarinder Singh deliberately extended the ‚Äúdate of bid tenders‚Äù to ‚Äòbenefit Today Homes‚Äô from April 20, 2005 to May 10,2005. The closure report says, ‚ÄúThe dates were extended for welfare of people as city center was a high quality project and there was a tough fight amid various companies. There is no evidence to prove that date was extended to benefit any company.‚Äù The inquiry says that ‚Äúthe design plan of the project was changed to favour the company.‚Äù

The closure report, putting a question mark on its own evidence submitted in court, says, ‚ÄúWe had submitted a project design map in the court procured from LIT. It showed project area as 25.59 acres whereas a map with the company showed total area as 29.22 acres. The extra 3.63 acres were for road and green belts, not for the company‚Äôs possession.‚Äù

Chetan Gupta, one of the accused in the FIR, filed an application for re-investigation with vigilance on March 7, 2017, three days before the Punjab Assembly poll results were announced on March 11. A decade after the chargesheet was filed in a Ludhiana court, charges have not been framed yet against any of the accused.

"Twin tasks from PM Modi to BJP CMs: Highlight govt schemes, expose Congress","New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah and Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Sushma Swaraj and other leaders at the party‚Äôs Mukhyamatri Parishad Baithak (meeting of chief ministers of BJP-ruled states) in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI Photo) New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah and Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Sushma Swaraj and other leaders at the party‚Äôs Mukhyamatri Parishad Baithak (meeting of chief ministers of BJP-ruled states) in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI Photo)

Barely a week after BJP chief Amit Shah assigned organisational duties for senior party leaders for 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah assigned two broad assignments to the chief ministers and deputy chief ministers of BJP-governed states on Monday. During the meeting of CMs and deputy CMs at the party headquarters here, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked them to learn from Shah, who has undertaken a nation-wide tour to highlight the 17 welfare schemes of the government in the form of a ‚ÄòSushasan Yatra‚Äô.

Shah spoke on Congress members‚Äô tactics in Rajya Sabha that has put a spanner in the constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC). ‚ÄúLet us go and do the pardafaash (expose) of Congress on this issue,‚Äù Shah is said to have told the BJP CMs and deputy CMs. Both these broad objectives outlined by the party leadership was reflected in the remarks made by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath at the conclusion of the meeting.

‚ÄúThe discussions were on ‚ÄòNew India‚Äô. There was also discussions on the ways to double the income of farmers by 2022‚Ä¶. Also, how can we eliminate corruption through Digital India,‚Äù Adityanath said after the meeting. He said the BJP will expose before the people the ‚Äúanti-OBC and anti-poor face of the Congress‚Äù. Adityanath said BJP leaders have decided to run a campaign against opposition parties in the coming months on this theme. Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh said the Prime Minister has advised them to use more technology in agriculture. The other issues the PM and Shah focussed on were education, infrastructure, and bringing transparency in social sector programmes, Singh said.

During the meeting, Modi is learnt to have asked the chief ministers to leverage the Direct Benefit Transfer mechanism using Aadhaar to curb pilferage in the delivery of welfare schemes. Modi, a source present in the meeting revealed, also nudged the chief ministers to adopt challenge-based selection for development grant like a ‚Äòsmart city‚Äô model and the Government e-Market (GeM) initiative in their states. ‚ÄúThe Prime Minister cited the smart city example to suggest that challenge/competition based selection model for any developmental project approval should be used to ensure proper ground work goes into developmental work,‚Äù a source said.

The source added that Modi also appealed the chief ministers present to use GeM mechanism for state government procurements. The leaders were also asked to focus on the efforts to double the income of farmers by 2022. Modi and Shah will monitor the progress each state makes on implementation of the roadmap to 2022 every three months, sources said. The chief ministers and the deputy chief ministers were asked to submit a report on the campaign to reach the welfare schemes to the people.

Maharashtra scholarship scam: Probe reveals institutes pocketed crores by using different ploys,"Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis (File photo) Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis (File photo)

A probe into allegations of swindling of government scholarships meant for backward class students has revealed that hundreds of institutes across the state pocketed several thousand crores by adopting different ploys since 2010. The probe report was submitted by a panel chaired by Nagpur Commissioner of Police K Venkateshan to the state government last month. The panel set up by the state government in February last month comprised two IAS members Ranjit Singh Deol and Piyush Kumar.

The panel checked audit records of 1,382 institutes and those of departments of Social Welfare and Tribal Development, which released the scholarships for SC, ST, OBC, VJ and NT categories of students. ‚ÄúIrregularities were detected at both the ends and the total amount defrauded in these checked institutes was Rs 2,174 crore. The state has 12,679 institutes benefitting under Social Welfare and about 11,000 institutes benefitting under Tribal Department scholarships. If records are checked for all of them, the size of the scam could be several thousand crore more,‚Äù sources told The Indian Express.

The panel has recommended a detailed and in-depth probe into the matter by state CID (Crime).

The panel has found that while the proprietors of these institutes carried out the fraud at their level, those officials in charge of scrutiny of the whole process and of keeping a tight leash on misappropriation had turned a Nelson‚Äôs eye towards the goings-on despite being fully seized of them. The two departments release total scholarship worth over Rs 3,000 per annum. This means over the past six years , the money released was in the range of Rs 18,000 crore.

The modus operandi was to register fictitious students either directly or by using duplicate transfer certificates (TCs) of students to register same student in various courses, many of which only existed on paper. Scholarships were disbursed even for non-eligible courses. The scholarships meant for students undertaking professional courses were bifurcated in two parts. Ninety percent of the amount meant for training and other fees were deposited in the institute‚Äôs account and the remaining 10 per cent was deposited in the students‚Äô accounts for their daily expenses. ‚ÄúMany of these institutes were being run from a single-room facility providing more than one courses,‚Äù the probe report has mentioned.

The panel also found out that in many cases, scholarships were pocketed twice a year by bifurcating yearly courses in two semesters.

Shockingly, in the age of Digital India, the entire system was being operated manually on paper instead of on a fool-proof computer software.

What makes the oversight at the government scrutiny level curious is that many 10 per cent student‚Äôs components returned to the two departments since those students never existed in reality and yet no red flags were raised. Sources said, ‚Äúthe panel has pointed out that this could be due to complicity of the officials and staffers concerned in the whole affair.‚Äù

Disbursals, however, came down drastically since the time the probe was instituted, according to sources.

Incidentally, the probe panel, in its interim report six months ago, had recommended initiation of criminal action in 70 ‚Äúvery obvious‚Äù cases of frauds. The government hasn‚Äôt moved in a single case so far.

The panel has called Rs 2,174 as ‚Äúrecoverable amount‚Äù. ‚ÄúPart of it is the 10 per cent meant for student‚Äôs personal expenses that has returned to government coffers, amount attributable to cases where audit papers were not shown to the panel by the errant institutes and amount releases to ineligible students and courses. And till date only Rs 64 crore have so far returned to government coffers,‚Äù sources added.

The panel has also suggested some measures to check future swindling of scholarship funds. They include, biometric registration of students‚Äô attendance, payments be linked to attendance and all rules and regulations be implemented by way of incorporating the system into a computer software.

"Nepal to hold general, provincial elections on Nov 26","While voters will directly vote for 165 lawmakers, 110 members of Parliament will be nominated through proportional representation. (Source: AP Photo) While voters will directly vote for 165 lawmakers, 110 members of Parliament will be nominated through proportional representation. (Source: AP Photo)

Nepal will hold parliamentary and provincial elections on November 26, the government announced on Monday, a key step towards cementing democracy in the politically unstable country. The decision was taken during a Cabinet meeting held this morning here, according to officials. ‚ÄúThe government took the decision to conduct the elections after holding consultations with the Election Commission (EC),‚Äù Minister for Information Mohan Bahadur Basnet told reporters.

The EC will work out the details of the elections.

As per the constitutional provision, the Nepalese Parliament will have 275 members.

While voters will directly vote for 165 lawmakers, 110 members of Parliament will be nominated through proportional representation.

Earlier, the EC had urged the government to conduct elections in two phases, saying that it would be difficult to conduct both the elections at once due to time constraint, lack of laws and human resources as well as logistic.

The announcement for holding the polls came nearly two months after Nepal conducted the second round of local-level polls across the country.

The EC had been preparing to hold federal and provincial elections in 31 mountainous and hilly districts.

Millions of Nepalese voted in the first two phases of local-level polls held in almost two decades as the Himalayan nation takes a key step towards cementing democracy.

Nepal has witnessed political instability.

The country has been in a political crisis since a decade-long Maoist conflict ended in 2006 and the monarchy was abolished.

Some Madhes-centric parties were opposed the elections on the ground that the new Constitution be amended to accommodate their views: more representation in the Parliament and redrawing of provincial boundaries.

Madhesis, who are mostly of Indian origin, had launched a prolonged agitation between September 2015 and February last year against the implementation of the Constitution.

"BJP president Amit Shah cancels Chennai visit, sparks Delhi reshuffle talk","The cancellation of the trip came on the day the two factions of the AIADMK buried the hatchet and former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam joined the Palaniswami government as Deputy Chief Minister. The cancellation of the trip came on the day the two factions of the AIADMK buried the hatchet and former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam joined the Palaniswami government as Deputy Chief Minister.

The sudden cancellation Monday of BJP president Amit Shah‚Äôs scheduled three-day visit to Tamil Nadu sparked speculation of an imminent reshuffle of the Union Council of Ministers. ‚ÄúThe reason for cancellation, we have been told, is that Amit Shah is required in Delhi for discussions,‚Äù a BJP source said on the change in the party president‚Äôs itinerary that was firmed much in advance. The Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP had planned a grand welcome for Shah in Chennai.

The cancellation of the trip came on the day the two factions of the AIADMK buried the hatchet and former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam joined the Palaniswami government as Deputy Chief Minister.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi reacted swiftly to the developments in Chennai. ‚ÄúI congratulate Thiru O Panneerselvam & others who took oath today. I hope Tamil Nadu scales newer heights of progress in the years to come,‚Äù Modi said in a tweet, adding, ‚ÄúCentre assures all possible support to CM Thiru Edappadi K. Palaniswami & Dy CM Thiru O Panneerselvam for the growth of TN. @OfficeOfOPS‚Äù.

Modi‚Äôs reaction to the developments in Chennai echoed the alacrity he had shown in reacting to the political developments in Patna on July 26. Modi had congratulated Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar then. Kumar resigned from the post to walk out of the Grand Alliance with the RJD and Congress. The BJP quickly embraced the JD(U), leaving aside over four years of bitter political rivalry.

Shah‚Äôs decision to cancel his Chennai visit and the Prime Minister‚Äôs response to the Tamil Nadu developments have added to the speculation on a Cabinet reshuffle.

Last Saturday, the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) passed a formal resolution to join the ruling NDA, indicating the party‚Äôs willingness to join the Modi cabinet at the Centre. Senior BJP leaders, likewise, suggested that AIADMK was also all set to join the Modi government.

Though a Cabinet reshuffle is the prerogative of the Prime Minister, sources in the BJP suggest that an informal consultation mechanism within the party has been activated. In fact, Shah, who played a crucial role in sounding out new inductees ahead of the previous Cabinet reshuffle last year, seems to have taken up the mantle of consultation this time too.

Shah is slated to meet BJP chief ministers one-on-one Tuesday. Party chief ministers, in fact, reached Delhi on Monday for the conference of BJP CMs at the party headquarters. Earlier, Shah had a meeting with Union Ministers Chaudhary Birender Singh, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha.

Currently, the Central government has 73 members, including the Prime Minister. The Constitution prescribes that the strength of Council of Ministers shall not exceed 15 per cent of the total members of Lok Sabha. Accordingly, the government can have 81 ministers. So, the Prime Minister does have some cushion to induct a few more ministers without breaching the stipulated quota.

With the exit of several key ministers ‚Äî Manohar Parrikar (Defence), M Venkaiah Naidu (Urban Development) and late Anil Dave (Environment Minister) ‚Äî there are key vacancies in the Modi cabinet since the reshuffle last July. Party sources did not rule out some making way for new faces given the electoral imperatives in Gujarat (late 2017) and Karnataka (early 2018) as well as with an eye on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

As for inductions, BJP insiders are claiming certain these could be from JD(U) and AIADMK. While JD(U) has a dozen MPs in both Houses of Parliament, the AIADMK has 50 MPs in Parliament.

"Barcelona terror attack: Spain hunts for driver in Las Ramblas van rampage, says Islamist cell dismantled","Police officers stand at a road block at the beginning of fiestas in Bilbao, Spain August 19, 2017, after a van ran down pedestrians in Barcelona‚Äôs Las Ramblas on Thursday. (Source: Reuters) Police officers stand at a road block at the beginning of fiestas in Bilbao, Spain August 19, 2017, after a van ran down pedestrians in Barcelona‚Äôs Las Ramblas on Thursday. (Source: Reuters)

Police were searching on Saturday for the driver of a van that killed 13 people when it ploughed into a crowd in Barcelona and were trying to determine whether two other suspected Islamist militants linked to the attack had died or were at large. The Spanish government said it considered it had dismantled the cell behind Thursday‚Äôs Barcelona rampage and an attack early on Friday in the Catalan seaside town of Cambrils.

Police arrested four people in connection with the attacks Barcelona and Cambrils, where a woman was killed when a car rammed passersby on Friday. Five attackers wearing fake explosive belts were also shot dead in the Catalan town.

‚ÄúThe cell has been fully dismantled in Barcelona, after examining the people who died, the people who were arrested and carrying out identity checks,‚Äù Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido told a news conference. But authorities have yet to identify the driver of the van and his whereabouts are unclear, while police and officials in the northeastern region of Catalonia said they still needed to locate up to two other people. Investigators are focusing on a group of at least 12 suspects believed to be behind the deadliest attacks to hit Spain in more than a decade.

In little more than a year, militants have used vehicles as weapons to kill nearly 130 people in France, Germany, Britain, Sweden and Spain. None of the nine people arrested or shot dead by police are believed to be the driver who sped into Las Ramblas, leaving a trail of dead and injured among the crowds of tourists and local residents strolling along the Barcelona boulevard. A Moroccan-born 22-year-old called Younes Abouyaaqoub was among those being sought, according to the mayor‚Äôs office in the Catalan town of Ripoll, where he and other suspects lived.

Spanish media reported that Abouyaaqoub may have been the driver of the van in Barcelona, but police and Catalan officials could not confirm this.

The driver in the Barcelona attack abandoned the van and fled on foot on Thursday after ploughing into the crowd. Fifty people were still in hospital on Saturday following that attack, with 13 in a critical condition. Many were foreign tourists. The Mediterranean region of Catalonian is thronged in the summer months with visitors drawn to its beaches and the port city of Barcelona‚Äôs museums and tree-lined boulevards. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks in Cambrils and Barcelona, a statement by the jihadist group said on Saturday.

RAIDS

Police searched a flat in Ripoll on Friday in their hunt for people connected to the attacks, the ninth raid so far on homes in the town nestled in the foothills of the Pyrenees near the French border. The flat had been occupied by a man named as Abdelbaki Es Satty, according to a search warrant seen by Reuters. Neighbours said he was an imam, a Muslim prayer leader. His landlord said he had last been seen on Tuesday. Scraps of paper covered in notes were strewn around the flat, which had been turned upside down in the police search.

Three Moroccans and a citizen of Spain‚Äôs North African enclave of Melilla have been arrested so far in connection with the attacks. Apart from Abouyaaqoub, authorities are searching for two other people though it is not certain they are at large. One or even both of them may have been killed in Alcanar, where a house was razed by an explosion shortly before midnight on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Catalonia‚Äôs home affairs department said. Casting new doubts over the investigation, El Pais said late on Saturday that biological remains of at least three people had been found in the ruins of the Alcanar house. It was not clear whether they could be from the three suspects still sought by the police or if more people were there.

Police believe the house in Alcanar was being used to plan one or several large-scale attacks in Barcelona, possibly using a large number of butane gas canisters stored there.

The Spanish government maintained its security alert level at four, one notch below the maximum level that would indicate another attack was imminent, but said it would reinforce security in crowded areas and tourist hotspots. Spanish media also said that security at the border with France was being beefed up.

TRIBUTES

Of the 14 dead in the two attacks, five are Spanish, two are Italians, two are Portuguese, one Belgian, one Canadian and one a U.S. citizen, emergency services and authorities from those countries have confirmed so far. A seven-year-old boy with British and Australian nationality who had been missing since the attack in Barcelona was found on Saturday in one of the city‚Äôs hospitals and was in a serious condition, El Pais newspaper reported.

Spain‚Äôs King Felipe and Queen Letizia on Saturday visited some of the dozens injured whose nationalities ranged from French and German to Pakistani and the Filipino. They are being treated in various Barcelona hospitals. The royal couple are expected to take part in a Catholic mass on Sunday morning at architect Antoni Gaudi‚Äôs famous Sagrada Familia church, a Barcelona landmark, in honour of the victims of the attack.

Barcelona‚Äôs football team will wear special shirts, bearing the Catalan words for ‚ÄúWe are all Barcelona‚Äù, and black armbands in memory of victims when they play their opening league game of the season on Sunday evening against Real Betis.

"Varnika Kundu Case: High Court refuses to entertain PIL, says aggrieved person can step up","Varnika Kundu with her father Varinder Singh Kundu (PTI) Varnika Kundu with her father Varinder Singh Kundu (PTI)

A DIVISION bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Monday refused to entertain a public interest litigation in the stalking and attempted abduction case of Varnika Kundu. Citing a 1991 apex court judgment, the division bench of Acting Chief Justice S S Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan made it clear that the court would have no difficulty taking up the case if Varnika herself approached the High Court.

The High Court bench was hearing a PIL filed by human rights lawyer Ranjan Lakhanpal seeking judicial supervision of the probe into the incident. The petitioner has also sought a CBI probe into the incident, though he did not press for it during the hearing.

‚ÄúIn a criminal case, only the aggrieved persons have a right to file the PIL,‚Äù observed the division bench while citing the landmark 1991 judgment on maintainability of a PIL in which the Supreme Court had ruled that ‚Äúeven if there are million questions of law to be deeply gone into and examined in a criminal case‚Ä¶ it is for them [aggrieved parties] and them alone to raise all such questions and challenge the proceedings initiated against them at the appropriate time before the proper forum and not for third parties under the garb of public interest litigants‚Äù.

The division bench, however, asked the counsel representing the Chandigarh Administration to remain present in the courtroom in the post-lunch hearing of the case. UT‚Äôs senior standing counsel R S Rai later appeared before the division bench and said he would seek instructions, and Chandigarh Administration can submit a status report on the ongoing probe into the case in a sealed cover before the division bench. Lakhanpal was asked to hand over a copy of the petition to Rai. The case was adjourned for Tuesday after the oral submission.

Earlier, the division bench observed, ‚ÄúIn the present case, FIR is already registered. High Court cannot interfere into the investigation. Let the victim come. In case the victim is aggrieved, let her come. If the victim comes, we have no difficulty,‚Äù the division bench observed and told Lakhanpal, ‚Äúyou tell the aggrieved person to come.‚Äù

The division bench said it could consider the PIL in the case if it is confined to the condition of CCTVs in the city. ‚ÄúThe way they (police) have acted in the case, it requires judicial intervention. I am also aggrieved. The whole country is aggrieved. We are not safe on roads,‚Äù argued Lakhanpal. ‚ÄúHow come the CCTVs were not working on the night the incident took place?‚Äù

Lakhanpal suggested that the court should take suo moto cognisance of the incident if there is a question of PIL maintainability. Making an intervention, senior advocate Puneet Bali, who was present in the court for an unrelated litigation, said the case primarily is related to lack of policing and infrastructure in the city. ‚ÄúIt is very shocking as a Chandigarh resident that women are not safe on roads,‚Äù Bali said.

The division bench observed that although the court agrees with the contentions raised before it in the case but what would happen if tomorrow another set of lawyers through a PIL said the statements of the girl were false. ‚ÄúIt is in this context that we are saying that only the person who is aggrieved should come,‚Äù remarked the bench.

United States crush Europe to retain Solheim Cup,"Juli Inkster said her team‚Äôs strength in depth had proved decisive. (Source: Reuters) Juli Inkster said her team‚Äôs strength in depth had proved decisive. (Source: Reuters)

The United States recorded their biggest victory over Europe in two decades and continued their near invincibility on home soil to retain the Solheim Cup in Iowa on Sunday.

The U.S. won by five points ‚Äî 16-1/2 to 11-1/2 ‚Äî the same margin as they started the final day in front of large and enthusiastic galleries at Des Moines Country Club.

Europe, needing to win eight of the 12 singles matches to achieve an unlikely victory, made U.S. captain Juli Inkster nervous with a strong start, but could only share the Sunday spoils. Both teams won five singles matches, while the other two were halved.

‚ÄúIt was just nerve-racking. I felt like I had no control over anything,‚Äù Inkster told reporters after guiding her team to a second consecutive victory. She was also at the helm in Germany in 2015.

She said her team‚Äôs strength in depth had proved decisive. ‚ÄúWe just played a little better. I think we were a little deeper. I played everybody at least three times. And I think that really helps for the confidence of the team.‚Äù

Europe captain Annika Sorenstam said the better team won. ‚ÄúWe just got outplayed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúComing in this morning we all knew that a small miracle needed to happen.‚Äù

The U.S. improved their winning record to 10-5 in the biennial event which started in 1990, and are now 7-1 at home, their only loss coming four years ago in Colorado.

The victory was their most dominant since the 17-11 trouncing in Wales in 1996. The hosts‚Äô superiority in four-ball matches was decisive this time.

They picked up seven of eight possible points in the format, which more than made up for the slightly better European record in the foursomes (alternate shot).

Veteran Cristie Kerr led the U.S. points, with three wins, no losses and one halved in four matches, raising her all-time points tally to 21, the most by any U.S. player in Cup history.

The top-ranked European player was Swede Anna Nordqvist, 3-0-1, with veteran Scot Catriona Matthew (3-1-0) and Karine Icher of France (2-1-1) the only other Europeans with winning records.

Europe sent out Nordqvist against Lexi Thompson in the first match, one of the most memorable in Cup history. Thompson, four down after nine holes, launched her comeback by holing out from 112 yards to win the par-five 11th with an eagle.

She later took the lead, before Nordqvist hit an eight-iron approach stiff at the par-four 18th for a conceded birdie, winning the hole and halving the match.

‚ÄúThat had to be the weirdest round of golf I‚Äôve ever played,‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúFront nine I don‚Äôt think I was awake and back nine I played the lights out. It was just a crazy round but Anna played great.‚Äù

Shikhar Dhawan has been chasing in on his purple patch and the last three months have been great for the Indian opener who has performed in both Tests and one-day international, captain of the Indian cricket team Virat Kohli said after Dhawan guided India to another victory with a century against Sri Lanka on Sunday.

‚ÄúThe last three months have been a great time for Dhawan and he‚Äôs cashing in on his purple patch. Hopefully he stays in this happy zone and we‚Äôll make sure he stays there, because he will win you games as long he‚Äôs in it. Once he starts going, it‚Äôs very difficult to stop him,‚Äù Kohli said.

Set a target of 217, India rode on Dhawan‚Äôs century which came off just 71 balls. India chased down the target in just 28.5 overs. Sri Lanka were off to a good start making 139 for one wicket in 25 overs before a collapse saw them being bowled out for 216.

‚ÄúThey got off to a really good start. We thought we would chase close to 300, it was a good pitch to bat on. The point of batting second was that it would come on later in the day. It came on like a dream.‚Äù he said.

Sri Lanka captain Upul Tharanga also said that his team got off to a good start and should have capitalised on it but failed to do so.

‚ÄúWe started really well and after that we didn‚Äôt capitalise. The middle order collapsed. One stage, we were thinking of 300. If you want to score 300 in an ODI, someone has to get a big score.

(Representational Image)

To dispel ‚Äúmyths‚Äù about Indian Railways favoring the high-cost bullet train over safety of passengers, an official mail from the Indian Railways on Monday stated that they are equally devoted to providing services and amenities to different segments of commuters. Citing examples of running trains at the lowest passenger fares in the world and providing one rupee clinics across railway stations, they claimed they had an ‚Äúunflinching commitment‚Äù to the poor and downtrodden.

Following the derailment of the Utkal Express in Muzaffarnagar in which 23 passengers lost their lives, the mail contained a response on how their focus on safety had not declined. As a response to one of the ‚Äúmyths‚Äù which stated that railways has diverted funds for the completion of bullet train project between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, it stated, ‚ÄúHigh speed train from Mumbai to Ahmedabad is being funded by government of Japan with less than 20% contribution from the government of India. This money, which came at incredibly attractive terms (0.1% rate of interest) was made available only for this high-speed project and was not made available to fund safety projects for Indian Railways,‚Äù excerpts from the mail read.

While adding how the bullet train will be a safe mode of transport, it added, ‚ÄúThe high speed train is the safest mode of transport in the world. The government has not diverted any funds from existing corpus.‚Äù The work on the bullet train project will commence soon, with the first tranche of $1 billion from a total loan of about $14 billion to be released during the visit of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the country on September 12-14. The $17-billion high-speed railway line of 508 km, which will be built on Japan‚Äôs Shinkansen technology, is expected to be operational by 2022-23, India‚Äôs 75th year of independence.

Excerpts from the mail further assert that one rupee clinics have been launched at important suburban stations and availability of janta meals is being ensured at all major stations. Implementation of new technologies like condition based monitoring system for rolling stock and Track and Ultrasonic Broken Rail Detection System are being piloted on the network, it reads. ‚ÄúWe have done the best as far as investment in these projects is concerned.

Four men accused of being members of an Islamist cell behind a van attack that killed 13 people in Barcelona last week appeared in court on Tuesday, a day after the alleged driver was shot dead by police. The four, the only ones still alive among the 12 men thought to constitute the group, were brought from Barcelona to Madrid where they were taken to the High Court under tight security for the hearing.

Police on Monday shot dead 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub, who they had identified as the driver of the van that careered along the packed Las Ramblas boulevard in Barcelona on Thursday, leaving a trail of dead and 120 injured from 34 countries. After the attack, Abouyaaqoub escaped on foot, stabbing to death a man who was parking his car and fleeing in the vehicle.

Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia said on Tuesday he walked some 40 km (25 miles) from Sant Just Desvern, the town on the outskirts of Barcelona where he ditched the hijacked car, to Subirats, where he was shot dead. Abouyaaqoub, who had changed clothes, walked by night and hid during the day, the paper said citing sources involved in the investigation. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the van attack and a separate deadly assault, hours later, in the coastal resort of Cambrils, south of Barcelona.

In Cambrils, a car rammed into passers-by and its occupants got out and tried to stab people. The five assailants were shot dead by police, while a Spanish woman died in the attack. Most of the 12 suspects lived in the town of Ripoll, set in forested hills beneath the Pyrenees north of Barcelona near the French border, and most were young men of Moroccan descent.

One of those who appeared before investigating magistrate Fernando Andreu was Driss Oukabir, whose passport was found in the abandoned van after the Barcelona attack. He turned himself in to police, protesting his innocence and saying his younger brother Moussa Oukabir, 17, who was killed in Cambrils, had stolen his documents. Also in court was Mohammed Aalla, owner of the Audi car used in the Cambrils attack. One of his brothers, Said, was killed in Cambrils and a second, Youssef, is believed by police to have died in an explosion at a house used by the plotters at Alcanar, southwest of Barcelona, the day before the Barcelona attack.

Mohamed Houli Chemlal, arrested after being hurt in the blast at Alcanar, also appeared in court as did Salah el Karib, who ran an internet cafe in Ripoll that, according to La Vanguardia newspaper, was used to send money to Morocco. At Tuesday‚Äôs closed-door hearing, Andreu planned to read out charges against the men expected to include counts of terrorism, murder and weapons possession. Andreu was then to ask the accused if they wish to testify, in which case he would question them.

The hearing was likely to end in the suspects being remanded in custody while the judge conducts an investigation that could take months or even years before a trial is organised. A Ripoll imam who police suspect may have radicalised the young men, Abdelbaki Es Satty, is believed to have died in the explosion in Alcanar. Police believe the blast foiled the group‚Äôs plans for a much bigger attack using explosives.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu

Thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday to protest against the jailing of three young democracy activists, with many questioning the independence of the Chinese-ruled city‚Äôs judiciary. On Thursday, Joshua Wong, 20, Nathan Law, 24 and Alex Chow, 27, were jailed for six to eight months for unlawful assembly, dealing a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompting accusations of political interference.

Thousands of people marched in sweltering temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius (86¬∞F) to the Court of Final Appeal, carrying placards and banners denouncing the jailing of the activists. Former student leader Lester Shum, who helped organize Sunday‚Äôs rally, said the number of protesters was the highest since pro-democracy protests in 2014 that paralysed parts of the financial hub for 79 days. ‚ÄúThis shows that the Hong Kong government, the Chinese Communist regime and the Department of Justice‚Äôs conspiracy to deter Hong Kong people from continuing to participate in politics and to protest using harsh laws and punishments has completely failed,‚Äù Shum said.

Protesters brandished a large banner saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a crime to fight against totalitarianism.‚Äù They shouted: ‚ÄúRelease all political prisoners. Civil disobedience. We have no fear. We have no regrets.‚Äù Ray Wong, 24, leader of pro-independence group Hong Kong Indigenous, said the issue is uniting government opponents.

‚ÄúSince the Umbrella movement, the radical and milder forces walked their own path,‚Äù he said, referring to the 2014 democracy movement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre now standing together. It is a good start.‚Äù In Sunday‚Äôs protests, some signs said ‚ÄúShame on Rimsky‚Äù, referring to Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen, who Reuters reported last week had overruled other legal officials who initially advised against pursuing jail terms for the three activists.

Wong and his colleagues triggered the 2014 mass street protests, which attracted hundreds of thousands at their peak, when they climbed into a courtyard fronting the city‚Äôs government headquarters. They were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly, but the Department of Justice applied for a review, seeking imprisonment.

On Friday, Yuen denied any ‚Äúpolitical motive‚Äù in seeking jail for the trio. The former British colony returned to China in 1997 under a ‚Äúone country, two systems‚Äù agreement that ensured its freedoms, including a separate legal system. But Beijing has ultimate control and some Hong Kong people are concerned it is increasingly interfering to head off dissent.

5-YEAR DISQUALIFICATION

The jail terms for Wong, Law and Chow disqualify them from running for the legislature for the next five years. Lau Siu-lai, one of six legislators expelled from the city‚Äôs legislature this year over the manner in which she took her oath of office, said the sentences were unreasonably harsh. ‚ÄúIt appears to be political suppression to strip away young people‚Äôs right to stand in elections,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI hope people will pay attention ‚Ä¶ We need to protect Hong Kong‚Äôs‚Äô rule of law.‚Äù Another protester carried a placard of Lady Justice with a red blindfold. ‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äôs Lady Justice and the rule of law‚Ä¶ are now being controlled by communists, and are now being twisted and she is now blind,‚Äù said 50-year-old artist Kacey Wong. While the decision to impose tougher sentences on the activists attracted widespread criticism in Hong Kong and overseas, the Hong Kong Bar Association and Law Society defended the court‚Äôs decision.

‚ÄúUnfounded comments that judicial decisions were made or influenced by political considerations originating outside Hong Kong are unjustified and damaging to our legal system, and to Hong Kong as a whole,‚Äù they said in a joint statement on Friday.

Marcos Alonso brace helps Chelsea spoil Spurs opener at Wembley,"Marcos Alonso (R) scored both goals for Chelsea. (Source: Reuters) Marcos Alonso (R) scored both goals for Chelsea. (Source: Reuters)

Marcos Alonso‚Äôs double reignited Chelsea‚Äôs title defense by securing a 2-1 victory over Tottenham on Sunday, with goalkeeper Hugo Lloris blundering to enable the Premier League champions to recover from their opening weekend loss.

For Tottenham, it was a gloomy start to its temporary residency at Wembley Stadium after going unbeaten throughout its final season at White Hart Lane before it was demolished to make way for a new venue.

Tottenham had been well placed to salvage a draw when Alonso‚Äôs first-half free kick was canceled out by Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi inadvertently heading the ball into his own net in the 82nd minute just after coming off the bench. But within six minutes Chelsea was back in front and Batshuayi‚Äôs blushes were spared in the London derby.

Chelsea defender David Luiz intercepted the ball after Victor Wanyama received it from Lloris‚Äô throw. Alonso helped to knock the ball along to Pedro Rodriguez on the left flank and he raced forward to receive a return pass in the penalty area. A shot from a tight angle then squirmed under the normally reliable Lloris in the Tottenham goal.

‚ÄúFrustrated? No,‚Äù Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said. ‚ÄúI am disappointed because I think we deserved more. Our performance was good.‚Äù

But not good enough. It was Tottenham‚Äôs seventh loss in 10 matches at the national football stadium, which was also used for the north London club‚Äôs European matches last season and there was also a visit in the FA Cup semifinals last season when it lost to Chelsea.

‚ÄúIt is not the reason we lost the game,‚Äù Pochettino said of Wembley, where the pitch is wider than Tottenham‚Äôs old White Hart Lane home.

Fueled by its formidable home form, Tottenham secured its highest league finish in more than 50 years last season as it was pipped to the title by Chelsea. Last season‚Äôs top two now have a win apiece after Tottenham opened the season with a victory over Newcastle last Sunday. Chelsea was left demoralized after it opened its title defense by losing at home to Burnley.

Donald Trump to visit Marine base in Yuma before Phoenix rally,"US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

The White House says President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit a Marine Corps base in Arizona along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump is set to visit Marine Air Station Yuma on Tuesday afternoon before he travels to Phoenix to hold a rally.

Yuma‚Äôs location along the US-Mexico border touches on one of Trump‚Äôs signature issues: his call for putting up a border wall to stem illegal immigration from Mexico.

The rally in Phoenix will take place at the city‚Äôs convention center. Trump tweeted about the event last week with a link for ticket availability.

The president has been holding campaign-style events in Trump-friendly areas since he took office. The rally will be his first in the West.

Top badminton racquet-makers go opposite ways to impress shuttlers,"A Yonex stringing stall at the World Championships venue. Yonex‚Äôs latest racquet is considerably heavier than rival Li Ning‚Äôs new offering. (Source: Express photo by Shivani Naik) A Yonex stringing stall at the World Championships venue. Yonex‚Äôs latest racquet is considerably heavier than rival Li Ning‚Äôs new offering. (Source: Express photo by Shivani Naik)

A wand may choose a wizard in Harry Potter, which was written in this part of the world, but badminton players definitely don‚Äôt take any chances. They choose the racquets they wield, with ‚Äî at times maddening ‚Äî precision.

So Chen Long might sport a pleasant, smiling visage either end of a badminton match, at times grinning even in the middle of it, but he is known to be exactingly meticulous about every detail of a racquet he can brandish like a sabre or a mace. His stringers clearly know a different World and Olympic champ than his fans.

His AirStream N99 national team racquet ‚Äî a fourth generation upgrade ‚Äî is a uniquely accelerating hit-machine with curving air-pockets carved along the frame. Strung at 33 pounds, the Li Ning generates the whiplash for the champion beast. He is known to pivot off the Li Ning Rangers ‚Äî costing in a range ‚Äúthat‚Äôs too expensive to even quote for the European market‚Äù, according to the equipment makers‚Äô representatives in Glasgow.

It‚Äôs in the racquets that competition in this sport hots up. While Yonex remain market leaders, there‚Äôs a fascinating contest between the leading racquet makers in technology. While AirStream‚Äôs ridden on the principle of reducing air resistance and lightening the mass, Yonex‚Äôs latest sword-scythe ‚Äî the Astrox 77 is headed in the opposite direction.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a heavier racquet on the head and the grip,‚Äù says company representative Yukisato Takahashi fronting the giant stringing facility in Glasgow‚Äôs World Championship dungeons. Both the top of the head and the end of the handle are chunky, so when the racquet is swung and the head goes down, the swing remains smooth and players get power on the shuttle.

While Li Ning‚Äôs aerodynamic centerpiece Windstorm 72 ‚Äî great for quick reactions, not so much for smashing ‚Äì was incredibly light at 72 gms, the Astrox is upwards of 80gm.

‚ÄúPower is more important,‚Äù says Takahashi, as he reveals the wonder carbon that‚Äôs got Yonex buzzing about its September 15 opening.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an amazing material called Namd,‚Äù he says. When swung overhead for a boomer smash, the shaft remains flexible, without jarring. The last racquet from the Yonex stable was the Duora Z-Strike, a two faced frame ‚Äî where the curved sharper edge on one side helped on the backhand and the box-like weighty other face helped putting the weight on the forehand smash. The markings were subtly colour-coded on the curve ‚Äì the orange-up for the right hander, the green-up for the left-hander.

Babolat, racquet giants in tennis, entered badminton 10 years ago, and are ambitious about doing well in Japan ‚Äì home of Yonex, besides cracking France, England and Denmark. It‚Äôs a crowded space with Carlton, Head and Victor, but the tennis-pathbreakers patented the metricflex, a different shape of the shaft ‚Äì rather than the rolled thin cylinder. When swung forward, the racquet doesn‚Äôt lose pace on vibrations.

The last big experiment was on the racquet head. It was isometric rather than oval like an egg-head, offering a larger sweet spot. This was after the 80s when racquet makers experimented with shapes like the tear-drop and another that resembled the tennis-spade. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very hard to come up with visible technology in badminton because there‚Äôs very few materials to work with. Tennis loves the graphite innovations, but in badminton it‚Äôs only the head shape and a thicker shaft (their latest is the thinnest at 6.5 mm, as against the usual 6.8),‚Äù says Steven Chapal of Babolat.

The well-built, tall Danes, who thrive on power, prefer the heavy, chunky, stiff connectors. Mathias Boe is known to be particularly fussy about the exact specifications.

Shuttle‚Äôs eternal quest ‚Äî a failed one until now ‚Äî has been to make a plastic shuttlecock play like the feathers. Defence becomes an almighty headache, as the plastic ones just dip like withering flowers.

A coup

It‚Äôs the Yonex strings that most shuttlers prefer owing to their superior quality, though younger players growing up on Li Ning are known to wield them as extensions of their forearms as well. Yonex pulled off a coup when they got the greatest ever Lin Dan on board ‚Äî the strings literally loosening up the hold on him as he moved a tad bit away from the national team, and Chen Long became the face of Li Ning.

‚ÄúIt hurts to see him in all the Yonex adverts, but we have Chen Long,‚Äù a Li Ning representative says.

Both Chong Wei and Lin Dan, the two best players of their generation, are known to string at 30-31 pounds, while someone like Ratchanok Intanon operates on 26, bringing in more skill and relying just about on the equipment (most racquets are naturally strung at 24).

While strings can vary according to player preference and weather, Taufik Hidayat was known to use very fine thin strings on his BG 65. Some towering Danes have pushed the limits of tension string, taking it right upto 36 or 37. Interestingly, both of India‚Äôs top singles players ‚Äî PV Sindhu and K Srikanth ‚Äî string at 32 on almost the same racquets ‚Äî the 66 Ulta-Max, the supergirl‚Äôs superpower unleashed from the taut mesh.

Carolina Marin is known to string at about 29 pounds.

At the other end of the spectrum is a player like Great Britain‚Äôs doubles bronze medallist from Rio, Chris Langridge. He wielded the two-faced wonder racquet for quite some time, but is said to have no clue about how it worked.

‚ÄúOh, he didn‚Äôt care to even understand how it worked. You‚Äôll see players spin the racquet and bore their eyes into the racquet face. Chris wouldn‚Äôt know one from the next,‚Äù guffaws a stringer for Yonex. The wizard maketh the magic, never mind the wand‚Äôs excruciatingly detailed specifications.

US President Donald Trump praised his former chief strategist Steve Bannon on Saturday, thanking him on Twitter for his service and his role in the presidential election campaign against Hillary Clinton. ‚ÄúI want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton ‚Äì it was great! Thanks S,‚Äù Trump tweeted. Trump on Friday fired Bannon in the latest White House shake-up.

Trump on Friday fired Bannon in the latest White House shake-up, removing a far-right architect of his 2016 election victory and a driving force behind his nationalist and anti-globalization agenda.

Bannon‚Äôs firing, a year and a day after Trump hired him as his campaign chief, put an abrupt end to the rabble-rousing political provocateur‚Äôs tumultuous tenure in a White House riven with rivalries and back-stabbing during which he clashed with more-moderate factions.

He was instrumental in some of Trump‚Äôs most contentious policy moves including the ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries, abandoning the Paris climate accord, tearing up international trade agreements and cracking down on illegal immigration. He was no friend of the Republican political establishment and was loathed by liberals but was a darling of some of the president‚Äôs hard-line conservative supporters.

Briton hailed as hero for comforting Spain attack victim,"Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain‚Äôs King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain‚Äôs King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

A 44-year-old Briton, believed to be of Indian-origin, is being hailed as a hero after he risked his life to comfort a young victim of the terror attack in Spain in which a van ploughed into pedestrians, media reports said. Harry Athwal, from Birmingham, had been holidaying in Spain last week when the attackers drove down Las Ramblas, Barcelona, at speed, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 other.

Without considering his own safety, Athwal ran from the first floor restaurant where he was dining to the pavement and cradled a young boy who had been struck by the van, The Mirror reported. He was seen comforting the boy at the site of the attack with a photo of them going viral as a terrible symbol of the destruction wrought by extremists on the city‚Äôs freedom. Athwal ran up to the boy as the terrorist‚Äôs van swerved mindlessly past, despite the bodies being thrown high in the air and cries from police to stay back for his own safety.

Later, at a hotel, recovering from the harrowing experience, Athwal told the daily that he cast aside all thoughts for his own safety in that moment because the boy suddenly became in his eyes, his own son. As such, he could not leave him alone to suffer, or to be mowed down again by the terrorists should they reverse callously back down the street.

‚ÄúHe was unconscious, his leg was bent the wrong way, there was blood coming out of his head, I knew it was more than blood. I was checking for a pulse and he didn‚Äôt have one,‚Äù Athwal said. ‚ÄúI put my hand on his back and I thought he had gone. I was stroking his hair and in floods of tears but I stayed with him, I sat there because I was not going to leave this child in the middle of the road,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe police were telling me to move but I would not leave him. All the time I was thinking the terrorists could come back but I was not leaving that child. To me, he looked like my own son. He was my son‚Äôs age, seven or eight. I just ran my hands through his hair, it was about comforting him,‚Äù Athwal added. The project manager, who lives with this wife Harjinder and sons Diernn, aged 19, and Khye, 8, also told the daily of how he had not even planned to visit Barcelona last week.

He visited with his own family, including his son, Khye, to celebrate the eight-year-old‚Äôs birthday earlier this month. But when his sister invited him to join her and friends in a spontaneous trip he agreed.

The group could not check into their rooms straight away when they arrived on Thursday, so decided to have a late lunch on Las Ramblas. They nearly ate down the middle of the pedestrianised street, exactly in the terrorist‚Äôs path, but a persuasive waiter luckily tempted them to try his restaurant on a first floor balcony. It was from there they watched the horrifying killing spree unfurl. Spanish police believe 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub drove the van through the crowded street.

Rafa Nadal has called his ascent once again to the top of the ATP charts as ‚Äúunbelievable‚Äù even though it hasn‚Äôt come in the most celebratory of moments. The Spaniard was sure of reaching the top of the ATP rankings last week when Roger Federer pulled out of Cincinnati Masters. Nadal has returned to World No 1 after a gap of three years plagued with injuries, surgeries and drop in form.

Nadal takes over the World No 1 position from Andy Murray who is suffering from a hip injury and hasn‚Äôt featured since Wimbledon. The Briton sat out Montreal and Cincinnati Masters ‚Äì key tune-up tournaments before US Open.

‚ÄúBeing No. 1 after all the things that I have been going through the last couple of years is something unbelievable,‚Äù the Spanish great told the ATP. ‚Äù

To regain the No. 1 ranking nine years after havingfirst reached it is unprecedented,‚Äù said ATP Executive Chairman and President Chris Kermode. ‚ÄúRafa has been setting records throughout his remarkablecareer and this one is as impressive as any. It showsincredible dedication and longevity, and we congratulate himon this amazing achievement,‚Äù he added.

Nadal, who was knocked out of the Cincinnati Masters in quarter-finals last week by Australian Nick Kyrgios, had slipped to 13th in the ATP rankings midway through 2015.

Kyrgios‚Äôs passage to Cincinnati final earned him a five-rung rise to 18th with Girgor Dimitrov, the man who beat him, breaking into the top 10 in 9th.

"Down in jungleland: A cow and bull story, or how not to attain bovine glory if you‚Äôre a rebel animal","(Illustration: Mithun Chakraborty) (Illustration: Mithun Chakraborty)

Recently, my rustic, very organic cousin invited me over to his farm to spend the weekend. When I reached there, I heard his exasperated voice from the large cowshed. I walked up to it and, since the best stories are those that you overhear, began to eavesdrop. And this is what I overheard. My cousin was talking to his cow, Moti, while milking her.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what you think. It‚Äôs a done deal. Monday morning and I‚Äôm admitting you to the hostel. I‚Äôve already made the down payment on rent and have examined the stalls. They are very comfortable: with air-conditioning, free wi-fi, HDTV, non-alcoholic mini-bar, etc. You will have 24-hour stall service, dung and pee collection (which will be donated to medical labs), and every morning, a member of the staff will come to milk you. We will visit you once a week on the weekends. You‚Äôll be very happy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go to a hostel!‚Äù Moti replied mutinously. ‚ÄúYou have no idea what the wardens do to inmates in hostels. And everyone knows what hostel food is like!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you should have thought about that earlier. You and your friends spend the whole day gallivanting about in the streets, eating rubbish and plastic bags and causing traffic jams.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, we do not! We just lie down in the middle of a highway to do yoga, that‚Äôs all. And, for your information, the mere sight of us cows doing the cud-chewing asana, calms the traffic down. Drivers slow down as they try to navigate around us. Sometimes, we bring the traffic to a complete halt for two hours to induce them into a deep coma! We are a beatific influence.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat may be, but what about these complaints I‚Äôve received about you being seen in the Glitizzy Mall in the company of a bafellow at night? Not only that, you went into a women‚Äôs lingerie store and‚Ä¶‚Äù Here my cousin sputtered to an outraged halt. ‚ÄúHave you no sense at all? What were you thinking? What will people say?‚Äù he went on.

‚ÄúThey can say and think what they like,‚Äù Moti replied, giggling. ‚ÄúYou should have seen Bhaisa darling‚Äôs face when I came out of the trial room. The dude got so excited that he totaled the Food Court. It was pandemonium!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs another thing. To be seen going around with a bafellow in the first place.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh chill, this is the 21st century and we are bovisexuals. Bhaisa‚Äôs very sweet, even if a bit thick between the horns. Besides, I have the right to go out with whom I choose.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wonder you were not arrested by the anti-Romeo squads.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt dare. You know, we have our own SPG to protect us at all times,‚Äù Moti snorted. ‚ÄúYou just want to take away our freedom as you have been trying to do with human girls. No going out, no mobiles, no boys within 20 km of the hostel. You can‚Äôt wear this, you can‚Äôt eat that, you can‚Äôt say this, you can‚Äôt write that, you can‚Äôt see this, you can‚Äôt hear that, you can‚Äôt have boyfriends, be back by this hour or else. Sorry, but we are not going to be your goongi gudiyas.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for you own good!‚Äù

‚ÄúPah! Besides, we get so much more protection than human girls. If any girl had come out of that trial room looking like I had, even though she had every right to‚Ä¶ We can wander the streets all day and night, and no one says or does anything to us, except, maybe, garland us. We can help ourselves to fruits, vegetables and snacks from roadside stalls without asking or paying, and no one dares protest.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear anything more about that lingerie store incident,‚Äù my poor cousin said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to live it down. Why can‚Äôt you be like your lovely step-sister Malti here? She has no problem going to a hostel.‚Äô

‚ÄúJee papaji,‚Äù Malti said in a sweet, low voice, making me wince. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so looking forward to it, but I‚Äôll miss you all so much. But, imagine, to be in a stall all day just ruminating. Can you think of anything more tranquil?‚Äù

‚ÄúHah! I know what you‚Äôll be ruminating about: those fabulous Jallikattu bulls or some of those jet-black Spanish studs,‚Äù said Moti.

‚ÄúPapaji, tell her. She‚Äôs being so mean!‚Äù

Then came the sound of a pail being kicked over and a shout from my cousin.

‚ÄúMoti, you kicked the milk bucket over deliberately. You are impossible!‚Äù

‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think adult human beings should be drinking milk: It‚Äôs stolen baby food. No adult animal drinks milk. Really, you people are infantile! Grow up!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! It‚Äôs the hostel for you, like it or not!‚Äù my cousin snapped. ‚ÄúI hope they‚Äôll teach you to be more respectful towards those who look after you.‚Äù

‚ÄúBah. Just let them try!‚Äù Moti snorted.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a real feisty one, isn‚Äôt she?‚Äù I commiserated with my cousin some time later. He nodded.

‚ÄúAlways been a rebel. I just hope she will simmer down in the hostel,‚Äù my cousin said.

Later, I checked to find out how the hostel admission process had gone off.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù my cousin said lugubriously, ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt admit her. They said her mother probably did some hanky-panky. Basically, that Moti‚Äôs cross-bred and has Jersey blood in her, and they‚Äôre only admitting wholesome, indigenously-bred khadi cows.‚Äù He cheered up. ‚ÄúBut they took sweet Malti!‚Äù

"PCB does U-turn, allows players to return to CPL, county cricket","Mohammad Amir plays for Essex. (Source: Express Archive) Mohammad Amir plays for Essex. (Source: Express Archive)

Pakistan Cricket Board sprung another surprise on Monday when it allowed the players recalled from the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) and counties in England to return to the competitions. This comes after they had abruptly called its players back to the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Lahore.

According to an ESPNcricinfo report, the main reason for the U-turn is though to be that postponement of the National T20 Cup which will now be played in November. But, the players still have to undergo fitness tests from August 22 to 24 before returning to their franchises in West Indies and England.

‚ÄúThe World XI series was not officially confirmed when we set the dates for our domestic tournament,‚Äù Sethi said in a press conference. ‚ÄúThat series falls right in the middle of when our competition would have been played. Then there‚Äôs a by-election [on September 17 on the seat of now-disqualified prime minister Nawaz Sharif], and after that the team has to go to the UAE, so the competition was squeezed out. As a result, we have moved it to November. An added advantage of this arrangement is that our players who are taking part in the CPL and other county will be able to take full part in those tournaments. This will make the players happy too, as well as the CPL.‚Äù

Ten Pakistan players play in the CPL and will now have to play back after August 24. The PCB had even recalled three non-centrally contracted players. Kamran Akmal, Sohail Tanvir and Mohammad Sami, the three players with no central contract, now fly back to West Indies.

The three players in the English counties were Mohammad Amir, playing for Essex until September, Sarfraz Ahmed, playing for Yorkshire in the Natwest T20 Blast, and Fakhar Zaman, set to join Somerset.

"Japan urges pressure on North Korea, military to seek record defence spending","Japan has urged to maintain international pressure on Pyongyang seeking its record defence spending with regard to the latter‚Äôs nuclear programme. (Source: AP Photo) Japan has urged to maintain international pressure on Pyongyang seeking its record defence spending with regard to the latter‚Äôs nuclear programme. (Source: AP Photo)

Japan‚Äôs new foreign minister Taro Kono said on Tuesday international pressure against North Korea must be maintained until Pyongyang clearly demonstrates that it will give up its nuclear programme. Japan‚Äôs military is set to ask for record defence spending of 5.26 trillion yen ($48.12 billion) for the year starting April 1, as it upgrades ballistic missile defences against possible North Korean military action, according to a draft document seen by Reuters. Fears about North Korea‚Äôs missile and nuclear development have grown in recent weeks as Pyongyang in July launched intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and said this month it was considering plans to fire missiles towards the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.

While the North later said it was holding off firing towards Guam, regional tension remains high.

‚ÄúInstead of going straight to dialogue, we need to keep on putting pressure on North Korea until the North clearly demonstrates its intention and action for moving toward (denuclearisation),‚Äù Kono said in an interview with a group of reporters.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the time to discuss (the resumption of) six-party talks,‚Äù Kono said.

Six-party talks, which were aimed at denuclearising the Korean peninsula and involved North and South Korea, China, the United States, Japan and Russia, collapsed in 2008 following a rocket launch by the North.

Kono, who replaced Fumio Kishida as foreign minister in a cabinet reshuffle this month, stressed the importance of implementing fully the existing U.N. sanctions on North Korea.

‚ÄúThere appears to be various loopholes (in the sanctions). These loopholes need to be carefully plugged one by one.‚Äù

Japan‚Äôs Ministry of Defense will request a 2.5 percent hike in defence spending, way above forecasts, according to the a defence paper, which if approved it will be the sixth straight annual increase as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe bolsters his nation‚Äôs military.

A chunk of the money will be used to purchase the first batch of SM-3 Block IIA missiles, which are designed to hit warheads in space before they plunge to their targets, a Japanese government sources said.

The new munition has more than double the range of missiles currently loaded on Japan‚Äôs ballistic missile defence destroyers in the Sea of Japan.

‚ÄúAny easing in defence spending increases would send the wrong message to North Korea and China,‚Äù the source said, asking not to be identified because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

Other spending in the proposed Japanese defence budget includes 88.1 billion yen for six more F-35 stealth fighters, 70 billion yen for a new submarine and 100 billion for two compact warships that will reinforce Japan‚Äôs navy in the East China Sea where it faces growing Chinese naval power, he added.

The proposed budget, however, may be pared back by Ministry of Finance officials who must juggle growing outlays on health and social spending as the nation‚Äôs population ages.

A five-year government defence plan that runs until the end of March 2019 stipulates that annual defence budget increases, minus spending to maintain U.S. military bases, should be limited to 0.8 percent. Japan over the past four years has largely stuck to that rate of increase.

"WWE Raw: Braun Strowman obliterates Brock Lesnar, watch video","Braun Strowman continued his brutality on Brock Lesnar. (Source: WWE) Braun Strowman continued his brutality on Brock Lesnar. (Source: WWE)

Braun Strowman had left Brock Lesnar in a mess at the WWE SummerSlam on Sunday. The two giants had collided, alongside Roman Reigns and Samoa Joe, in a fatal four way match for the Universal Championship title at the Brooklyn Center in New York. Strowman had thumped Lesnar through the announcer‚Äôs table and the image of Lesnar underneath the table is one of the lasting memories from the night. So much so, Lesnar needed medical attention and left in a stretcher ‚Äì only to return later and successfully defend his title. But there was a score to settle.

Even though he had put Lesnar through three tables and put him on a stretcher, The Gift of Destruction clearly wasn‚Äôt done with The Beast and still had more to do as he went after the title. Even as Lesnar and Paul Heyman celebrated the title defense, Strowman chose to let his beatdowns do the talking. And he had one more at his disposal. And that was done courtesy a pair of bone-jarring Running Powerslams and to top it all off, he made his intentions clear by posing with the Universal Title.

Fittingly enough, their match for the title, was confirmed later in the night to be contested at WWE No Mercy. And the words are extremely suitable for the two ‚Äì there will be NO MERCY.

Game is on,"Reports of 80 Russian teens killing themselves after having accepted the challenge have been debunked by fact-checking sites such as Snopes.com (Archive) Reports of 80 Russian teens killing themselves after having accepted the challenge have been debunked by fact-checking sites such as Snopes.com (Archive)

The teenager, hunched over a smartphone, hermetically sealed from the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world, is the stuff of parental anxiety. It is hardly surprising, then, that news of the Blue Whale challenge has brought on a panic attack across the world. The idea of a Pied Piper-like game, arising from the unknown spaces of the interwebz and leading vulnerable young people to self-harm and suicide, has rattled governments into action.

In the face of this viral paranoia, the facts are rather shaky. Reports of 80 Russian teens killing themselves after having accepted the challenge have been debunked by fact-checking sites such as Snopes.com. Closer home, in India, there has yet been no evidence to link recent teen suicides to the challenge. The spread of this faceless fear, from Brazil to the US and India, has been compared to the blitzkrieg of fake news.

The Blue Whale is a mirror to a tumultuous time. It reveals our ambivalence about technology and social media, which have never before shaped the intimacies of human life to this extent. It has given us a morality-play like template to deal with the rebellion of adolescent life ‚Äî all we need to rescue our children is to slay the dementor of the internet (and not by talking to them, or trying to understand their unspoken alienation).

But, most of all, it reveals a crisis of societies in the throes of dizzying, incomprehensible social and political change. It reflects a longing for a more innocent time, when teenagers stayed home and watched state television ‚Äî or, best of all, deferred to parental authority to discern the good from the predatory. But the real and the fake, in our brave new world, are welded into a mashup. That is, perhaps, why we need bogeys such as the Blue Whale challenge to make sense of these interesting times.

Taliban reacts to Donald Trump‚Äôs Afghan policy: Trump‚Äôs Afghan strategy is ‚Äònothing new‚Äô,"‚ÄúFor generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are fresh and we will continue this war until our last breath,‚Äù Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location. (Photo: AP ‚ÄúFor generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are fresh and we will continue this war until our last breath,‚Äù Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location. (Photo: AP

The Taliban dismissed Donald Trump‚Äôs strategy for Afghanistan as vague and ‚Äúnothing new‚Äù today after the US president cleared the way for thousands more American troops to be sent to the war-torn country. ‚ÄúFor now I can tell you there was nothing new in his speech and it was very unclear,‚Äù in Afghanistan, told AFP.

He added that the militants were preparing a formal statement which would be released later. Trump backtracked from his promise to rapidly end America‚Äôs longest war in his first formal address to the nation as commander-in-chief late Monday, though he did not offer specifics.

He said he had concluded ‚Äúthe consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable‚Äù, leaving a vacuum that terrorists ‚Äúwould instantly fill.‚Äù A senior Taliban commander told AFP that Trump was just perpetuating the ‚Äúarrogant behaviour‚Äù of previous presidents such as George Bush.

‚ÄúHe is just wasting American soldiers. We know how to defend our country. It will not change anything. ‚ÄúFor generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are resh and we will continue this war until our last breath,‚Äù he told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location.

He added that the statement proved the current Afghan government ‚Äúis a US puppet‚Äù. The insurgents also signalled their intentions minutes after Trump spoke by claiming the US embassy in Kabul had been the target of a rocket attack late Monday.

The rocket landed in a field in the city‚Äôs diplomatic quarter, with no casualties reported. While Trump refused to offer detailed troop numbers, senior White House officials said he had already authorised his defence secretary to deploy up to 3,900 more troops to Afghanistan.

He also lambasted ally Pakistan for offering safe haven to ‚Äúagents of chaos.‚Äù A commander from the Taliban-allied Haqqani network, long believed to have links to Pakistan‚Äôs shadowy military establishment, told AFP that Trump ‚Äúhas proved it‚Äôs a Crusade‚Äù.

‚ÄúHis statement has proved that he wants to eliminate the entire Muslim umma (community),‚Äù he said. Prior to Trump‚Äôs announcement the Taliban had written an open letter warning him not to send more troops and calling for the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.

Priyanka Chopra‚Äôs glam-meets-casual style is giving us fashion goals,"Priyanka Chopra is acing her fashion game in Mumbai. (Source: Instagram/431_88, afashionistasdiaries) Priyanka Chopra is acing her fashion game in Mumbai. (Source: Instagram/431_88, afashionistasdiaries)

We knew we were in for a treat this time the day Priyanka Chopra landed in Mumbai! The Quantico star gave a new meaning to the term ‚Äòstar-worthy dressing‚Äô in all-white. In all fairness, her airport look is probably one of the best travel styles we have seen on the beauty in a long time! The wrap dress from Hellessy with the gorgeous details like the gold stripes, slit sleeves, and a beautiful neckline was carried off really well by her and we are in love with how she styled it with a cool pair of white boots from Stuart Weittzman.

Now, we are not a big fan of the black handbag she is seen carrying, but given how everything else is on point, we can overlook this minor flaw.

Even her beauty game was inspiring with hair in soft waves, dewy make-up and a beautiful brown-tangerine lip shade. If you ask us, we woud definitely like to replicate this look, minus the bag.

On a different ocassion, for a casual dinner outing at a friend‚Äôs house, she was seen acing her fashion game once again with a sequined, bat wing sleeve top and frayed denims. Chopra picked a fresh-off-the-runway top from designer Shweta Kapur‚Äôs label 431-88 to add some oomph to her look.

This lady is sure giving us fashion goals on how to look glamorous without trying too hard. Don‚Äôt miss out on how she took it up a notch by styling it with a pair of metallic silver heels from Lulu and Sky. Here, too she was seen sporting the same brown-tangerine lip shade, but the casually tousled hair gave out a more relaxed vibe. We like what we see, what about?

Which look do you like the most? Let us know in the comments below.

"Wrestling World Championships: Greco-Roman wrestlers fail, no wins for India on day one","Hardeep Singh lost his first bout at World Championships. Hardeep Singh lost his first bout at World Championships.

The first day of the Wrestling World Championships did not turn out to be a fruitful one for India as all four wrestlers who were in action on Monday bowed out of the competition without winning a single bout in Paris. Beginning with the Greco-Roman category, the Senior World Championships saw wrestlers compete on the first day in Paris in the 71kg, 75kg, 85kg and 98kg categories.

India had fielded a wrestler in each of theses categories but got no results. In the 71kg category, Yogesh of India suffered an opening round loss to Takeshi Izumi of Japan. Though it was a 3-1 loss, it ended the Indian‚Äôs campaign as the Japan wrestler lost in the quarter-finals and failed to give Yogesh a chance in repechage.

In the 75kg category, Gurpreet Singh faced Mindia Tsulukidze of Georgia in the opening round. He also had a bad start which ended in a 1-5 defeat against his opponent. The Georgian then lost in the quarters which ended the campaign for Gurpreet.

Khatri, who had represented India at the Rio Olympics, met with similar fate as he lost his opening round bout to Viktor Lorincz of Hungary via technical superiority as his opponent made a difference of eight points in the score. The wrestler from Hungary lost in the quarter-final ending the Worlds for the Indian.

India‚Äôs last wrestler on day one was Hardeep who had also represented India at the Rio Olympics. In the 98kg opening round bout, Hardeep faced Vilius Laurinaitis of Lithuania and though he scored two points, he lost 5-2. Even Laurinaitis did not advance to the final and Hardeep did not get a chance in repechage.

Four Indian wrestlers will be in action on Tuesday as Greco-Roman competitions continue in Paris. The categories that will see wrestlers compete on Tuesday are 59kg, 66kg, 80kg and 130kg.

The Doklam miscalculation,"Representational Image Representational Image

The ongoing stand-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers in the Doklam tri-junction area is not an unexpected outcome of the steady slide in India-China relations over the last few years. While the construction of a road by the Chinese for military purposes in Bhutanese territory ‚Äî disputed by the Chinese ‚Äî was most likely a calculated provocation, the underlying strategic motives as also the timing of this action, remain unclear. Is it a warning to India about its deepening US relationship; or a move to prise Bhutan out of the Indian embrace; or to express annoyance with the Indian rejection of OBOR? Or is it a combination of all the above and the intent is to ‚Äúteach a lesson‚Äù to a disconcertingly resurgent India?

Given that China is presently confronting several issues of critical strategic import, such as the North Korean crisis, the deepening US defence relationship with Taiwan, the rising tensions in the South China sea, the logic and the timing of the confrontation with India in a remote corner of the Himalayas defies easy explanation. Add to this is the fact that President Xi Jinping is coming up for re-election for a second term in the crucial 19th plenum of the Communist Party to be held in October. Given the extreme positions taken by the Chinese, a withdrawal would involve an unacceptable loss of face. On the other hand, an escalation would scarcely buttress Xi‚Äôs standing domestically, while severely denting it internationally. In fact, an armed conflict could risk derailing the OBOR project in which Xi is heavily invested. Unlike past imperialisms, coercion and commerce do not mix easily in present times.

When Xi took over in 2012, China stood tall among the ruins of Western capitalism devastated by the great recession of 2008. The most important task facing the Chinese economy was the rebalancing necessary to address the structural problems created by the weakening of the export engines and the over reliance on investment, which together had been the primary drivers of its spectacular growth. Xi, however, has been preoccupied with consolidating his political power, leaving issues of economic reform largely on the back burner. Since China requires rising prosperity to justify the draconian curbs on individual freedoms, allowing growth to slow is a risk which Xi has been unwilling to take. In effect, the Chinese economy remains precariously leveraged and investment-driven with escalating risks of a hard landing in the future. On the political front, Xi‚Äôs anti-corruption campaign ‚Äî mainly targeted at opponents ‚Äî has fostered fear and riven the party into several factions. Thus, despite Xi being designated as ‚Äúcore‚Äù leader and his re-election for another term virtually certain, the insecurity in the party leadership is palpable.

Growing state repression is an expected response from an authoritarian regime to internal problems. Under Xi, this has been accompanied by an aggressive articulation of territorial claims as an important plank of foreign policy. By this, China has, in effect, abandoned its stated ‚Äúdoctrine of peaceful rise‚Äù which had provided to the world an anodyne explanation of its growth. However, as Edward Luttwak has argued, China‚Äôs ‚Äúpremature assertiveness‚Äù could prove self-defeating as it may propel other powers such as the US, Japan and India to unite against it.

The Doklam venture is almost certainly a Chinese miscalculation. It was likely born of the confidence that the strategy of threats and belligerence, which proved so effective against some South-East Asian nations, would quickly settle the matter in their favour ‚Äî as in a Sun Tzu script ‚Äî without firing a shot. However, given the unwavering stand taken by India, supported by Bhutan, there do not appear to be any winning options for the Chinese at present.

The abiding India-China hostility is only partly explained by a jostling for strategic space between powerful neighbours ‚Äî also relevant is the usually downplayed factor of ideological competition between two antithetical political systems. ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù is the most hated word in the lexicon of the Chinese state.

The threat to China from a rising India is not military. It is from the demonstration effect of a successful democracy which could prove potentially destabilising to a totalitarian system under visible signs of strain.

US and South Korean troops start drills amid North Korea standoff,"The allies have said the drills are defensive in nature. (Representational image/Agencies) The allies have said the drills are defensive in nature. (Representational image/Agencies)

US and South Korean troops kicked off their annual drills Monday that come after President Donald Trump and North Korea exchanged warlike rhetoric in the wake of the North‚Äôs two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month. The Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills are largely computer-simulated war games held every summer and have drawn furious responses from North Korea, which views them as an invasion rehearsal. Pyongyang‚Äôs state media on Sunday called this year‚Äôs drills a ‚Äúreckless‚Äù move that could trigger the ‚Äúuncontrollable phase of a nuclear war.‚Äù

Despite the threat, US and South Korean militaries launched this year‚Äôs 11-day training on Monday morning as scheduled. The exercise involves 17,500 American troops and 50,000 South Korean soldiers, according to the US military command in South Korea and Seoul‚Äôs Defense Ministry.

No field training like live-fire exercises or tank maneuvering is involved in the Ulchi drills, in which alliance officers sit at computers to practice how they engage in battles and hone their decision-making capabilities. The allies have said the drills are defensive in nature.

South Korea‚Äôs President Moon Jae-in said Monday that North Korea must not use the drills as a pretext to launch fresh provocation, saying the training is held regularly because of repeated provocations by North Korea.

North Korea typically responds to South Korea-US military exercises with weapons tests and a string of belligerent rhetoric. During last year‚Äôs Ulchi drills, North Korea test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile that flew about 500 kilometers (310 miles) in the longest flight by that type of weapon. Days after the drills, the North carried out its fifth and biggest nuclear test to date.

Last month North Korea test-launched two ICBMs at highly lofted angles, and outside experts say those missiles can reach some US parts like Alaska, Los Angeles or Chicago if fired at normal, flattened trajectories. Analysts say it would be only a matter of time for the North to achieve its long-stated goal of acquiring a nuclear missile that can strike anywhere in the United States.

Earlier this month, President Donald Trump pledged to answer North Korean aggression with ‚Äúfire and fury.‚Äù North Korea, for its part, threatened to launch missiles toward the American territory of Guam before its leader Kim Jong Un backed off saying he would first watch how Washington acts before going ahead with the missile launch plans.

Soha Ali Khan shares power-packed pic doing prenatal yoga; here‚Äôs why you should follow her lead,"Soha Ali Khan practising the warrior pose. (Source: Instagram/sakpataudi) Soha Ali Khan practising the warrior pose. (Source: Instagram/sakpataudi)

When you are a celebrity, the need to stay fit is more of a necessity than just an overpowering desire to have a toned body. In the entertainment industry, not having a slender figure means setting off a torrent of criticism where bodyshaming simply becomes a part of reality. So, when Kareena Kapoor Khan walked about in unbridled abandon during her pregnancy, it ushered in a new outlook towards body weight and, of course, expecting celebrities. Over the past year, we‚Äôve seen the pregnant Bollywood mom-to-be brigade flaunt their pregnancy, and Kareena was there leading the pack.

Well, following her footsteps at the moment is sister-in-law, Soha Ali Khan. Not only is the actor, dressing up in beautiful maternity wear and enjoying every bit of her pregnancy, she is also showing others on how to stay fit during the nine months.

Recently, Khan shared a photo on Instagram where she can be seen practising yoga, the warrior pose to be precise, dressed in simple black leggings and a yellow crop top. Earlier this year, she shared another photo which she captioned: ‚ÄúWho says you can‚Äôt stay fit when pregnant ?!‚Äù.

Certainly, not us!

Prenatal yoga has always been a favourite of A-listers as it believed to keep limbs toned, improve balance and circulation, and make labour easier. Actually, it is considered as one of the best forms of exercise during pregnancy. Here‚Äôs why:

1) Prenatal yoga increases stamina and helps maintain balance. With the growth of a life inside the mother, more energy and strength is needed to function and yoga strengthens the hips, back, arms and shoulders. It also helps maintain balance physically and aids in emotional growth. A 2012 University of Michigan study showed that mindfulness yoga, which combines physical poses with meditation practices, can bring measurable relief to women who may face depression during pregnancy.

2) Prenatal yoga prepares for the birth of the child by focusing on relaxation and breathing techniques. This works as a good tool for labour during contractions because deep breathing can regulate blood pressure and heart rate and provide the much-needed oxygen to your baby and your muscles.

3) It increases circulation within the joints and muscles with regular practice, which, in turn, reduces swelling caused during pregnancy and increases immunity. It also calms the nervous system through deep breathing which benefits the body with an improved digestive system, and good sleep.

4) Common pregnancy complaints like lower back pain, nausea, insomnia, headaches, shortness of breath, and carpal tunnel syndrome can be reduced with regular practice. Like we have said earlier, stretching and toning the muscles help in improved blood circulation.

5) It‚Äôs a good way to channelise attention towards what‚Äôs going on within your bodies. Certain poses, like the Hero pose, in which you are required to sit back on your heels and then sit up straight to lengthen your spine, can become meaningful and a good way to connect with your unborn child.

Valencia sign Geoffrey Kondogbia on loan from Inter Milan,"Geoffrey Kondogbia will now play for Valencia. (Source: AP File) Geoffrey Kondogbia will now play for Valencia. (Source: AP File)

Valencia announced the signing of French holding midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia on loan from Inter Milan on Monday, their third signing in four days as new coach Marcelino sets about reinforcing his team‚Äôs defensive capabilities.

Kondogbia, 24, returns to La Liga four years after leaving Sevilla for AS Monaco, later joining Inter in 2015, and follows the signing of centre backs Jeison Murillo and Gabriel Paulista, who joined last Friday from Inter and Arsenal respectively.

Local media reports suggest that Valencia‚Äôs Joao Cancelo will go on loan to the Serie A club as part of the deal. The Portuguese defender appeared to bid an emotional farewell to Valencia fans after Friday‚Äôs 1-0 win at home to Las Palmas, as the team‚Äôs new campaign under former Villarreal coach Marcelino got off to a positive start.

According to reports in the Spanish media, Valencia will need to pay 25 million euros ($29.5 million) to buy Kondogbia at the end of his one-year loan period.

Marcelino, who turned Villarreal into one of the most solid and consistent sides in the league after winning promotion in 2013 and took them to the Europa League semi-finals in 2016, has pledged to bring defensive stability to a chaotic Valencia side which conceded a club record 65 goals last season.

"‚ÄòSo lucky, you know‚Ä¶ I will be first engineering graduate from my tribe‚Äô","C Kalyani (left) and roommate R Soumika on the JNTU campus. Sreenivas Janyala C Kalyani (left) and roommate R Soumika on the JNTU campus. Sreenivas Janyala

There is a spring in C Kalyani‚Äôs step as she walks out of the girls‚Äô hostel on the sprawling, leafy campus of Jawaharlal Nehru Technology University (JNTU) at Sulthanpur in Telangana. It is her first day in college. The diminutive girl is the first from her vanishing community, the Primitive Tribal Group (PTG) Thoti, to go to an engineering college.

‚ÄúI cannot believe that I am here on this huge and beautiful campus and such a great college. I am so lucky, you know? It is a dream come true,‚Äù she says. She arrived at the campus earlier this month to complete the formalities for joining. ‚ÄúThis is the first time I am staying so far away from home. It is a six-hour drive to my home from here,‚Äù says Kalyani, who belongs to Dubarpet in Adilabad district.

‚ÄúI am happier because my roommate happens to be a friend from the tribal coaching centre,‚Äù she says. Her roommate, R Soumika, is from the Lambada community and has joined electronics and communications engineering. Kalyani, who aims to become a scientist, has opted for material science and nanotechnology engineering. She is eagerly waiting for classes to start.

‚ÄúEspecially maths, I love it,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI like the regimen here. Breakfast is at 8 am at the dining hall, then it‚Äôs back to room to get ready to go to classes at 10. At 1:30 we will break for lunch and go back at 2 and study again till 4:30. Then, back to the room. I am loving it already.‚Äù Fighting against various odds including poverty in their communities,Kalyani and Soumika made it up to Intermediate, then were selected for coaching for JEE and Engineering Agricultural Medical Common Entrance Test (Eamcet) along with 28 other tribal students at Telangana‚Äôs tribal students‚Äô welfare residential schools in Adilabad district under a special coaching programme called Star-30. The tribal students cracked JEE Main, JEE Advanced (for IITs) or Eamcet to secure admission to top engineering colleges.

Kalyani says her father C Krishna, a labourer, struggled to send her to school. ‚ÄúHe wept for joy when I told him I had made it to engineering college. No girl in my tribe has studied beyond class V. Boys drop out after X. But I insisted I want to study and my father struggled hard to pay school fees and buy books,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI will be the first engineering graduate from my community. My brother is in second year Intermediate and sister is in VII. I did not get much time to prepare for JEE but I passed Eamcet. I am lucky to get admission to a top college like JNTU.‚Äô‚Äô

At a time when populations of forest-dwelling tribal communities are dwindling across the country, seven boys and girls from three primitive and vanishing tribes of Telangana created history this year by becoming the first from their communities to join engineering colleges ‚Äì Pujari Adharsh, Pudari Srinivas, P Pavan Kalyan, M Pushpalatha from the PTG Manne community, and K Ramatha and A Parmeshwar from PTG Kolam, besides Kalyani from PTG Thoti. Counselling ended last fortnight. In another first, two boys from the Lambada community got admissions in IIT Varanasi and VNIT Nagpur.

Mancherial district collector R V Karnan, Adilabad DC Dr Jyothi Buddha Prakash, and in-charge Anura Jayanthi were given Telangana Excellence Awards on Independence Day for the project Star-30. Less than 2,000 people each of the three PTG groups live in Telangana. Most of them live in tribal hamlets on the periphery of forests in Adilabad and Karimnagar districts. Literacy levels are very low and most of them work as farm labour.

Last Tuesday, Adharsh joined JNTU at Karimnagar, opting for information technology. He ranked 2594th in JEE in the ST category. Hailing from Ippalaguda, a tribal settlement in Kouthala mandal of the newly created Komaram Bheem Asifabad district, Adharsh made it through extreme poverty. His father P Buchaiah, who used to work as a farm labourer, was paralysed three years ago and remains bedridden now while his mother Sharada now works for daily wages.

‚ÄúAfter I passed JEE, someone gave me a cheque for Rs 10,000. I added another Rs 500 and paid the fees of Rs 10,500 at JNTU. I borrowed another Rs 5,000 and paid hostel fees,‚Äù Adharsh says. ‚ÄúWhen I started from my village to go to college, my mother had just Rs 100 which she gave me for bus fare. I am hoping the government will reimburse the fees and I will be able to pay fees next year.‚Äù

In his community, few study beyond class X. ‚ÄúGirls drop out after V. Until I joined special coaching camp, I did not know about IIT or Eamcet,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere were many reasons including severe financial hardships for me, too, to drop out. It was constant encouragement from my teachers and Mancherial district collector and ITDA project officer R V Karnan that I made it this far,‚Äô‚Äô he said.

Pavan Kalyan‚Äôs parents work as labourers in Kompalle village in Mancherial district. ‚ÄúMy maths teacher in junior college told me about the coaching camp for tribal students started by Karnan. Until then I did not know about IIT,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI could not clear it but cracked Eamcet because of the coaching. I got admission at CMR College of Engineering and Technology, Hyderabad,‚Äù he says.

Srinivas, also of the Manne tribal group like Adharsh and Pavan, cleared JEE Advanced. He wants to start an IT start-up company after his engineering. ‚ÄúAs soon as I make some money, I want to adopt my village Nambal in Komaram Bheem Asifabad district and set up schools and a college. I want to arrange free coaching to my village students to compete in all-India entrance tests,‚Äù he says. Srinivas has joined electronics and communication engineering in Arjun College of Science and Technology. His father P Ganesh works as a farm labourer.

Ramatha is the first woman from her Kolam community to get admission in an engineering college. Her brother Jyotiram became the first man to go to college when he got a seat in B Ed recently. Ramatha got a seat at Kakatiya Institute of Technology and Science for Women at Nizamabad on Monday. Hailing from Arkapur village in Nizamabad district, her father Atram Abhiman, a poor farmer, was in a quandary initially. ‚ÄúI can pay fees for only one of them. I don‚Äôt have enough money to send both my son and daughter to college. I am very happy that my daughter has been offered a seat in a top engineering college, and she is the first in our small community, but I may not be able to afford the fees,‚Äù Abhiman says. A week later, he borrowed and paid for Ramatha‚Äôs fees.

‚ÄúThere are only 2,000 people of my tribal community left in,‚Äù Ramatha says. ‚ÄúMost of them still live in hamlets in forests or on the periphery, mostly working as farm labour. They do not know anything about engineering or medical colleges or IIT or EAMCET. Their life just revolves around ensuring one proper meal a day. The coaching given to students in tribal schools will change the lives of tribal students for ever. I want to complete my computer science engineering course.‚Äù S Bujangarao of the Gond community got admission at VNIT at Nagpur in metallurgical and materials science engineering after becoming the first Gond to clear JEE. Although three students from the Lambada community cracked JEE last year, this year Badavath Rajender secured a better rank and went to VNIT.

"After US destroyer collision, Chinese paper says US Navy a hazard","The Guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) is moored pier side at Changi naval base in Singapore following a collision with the merchant vessel Alnic MC Monday. (Source: AP) The Guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) is moored pier side at Changi naval base in Singapore following a collision with the merchant vessel Alnic MC Monday. (Source: AP)

The U.S. navy‚Äôs latest collision at sea, the fourth in its Pacific fleet this year, shows it is becoming an increasing risk to shipping in Asia despite its claims of helping to protect freedom of navigation, an official Chinese newspaper said. The USS John S. McCain and the tanker Alnic MC collided while the guided-missile vessel was nearing Singapore on Monday. The collision tore a hole in the warship‚Äôs port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area. Ten sailors are missing.

The collision ‚Äì the fourth major accident in the U.S. Pacific fleet this year ‚Äì prompted a fleet-wide investigation and plans for temporary halts in operations to focus on safety. The state-run China Daily said in an editorial on Tuesday that people will wonder why such a sophisticated navy keeps having these problems. ‚ÄúThe investigations into the latest collision will take time to reach their conclusions, but there is no denying the fact that the increased activities by U.S. warships in Asia-Pacific since Washington initiated its rebalancing to the region are making them a growing risk to commercial shipping,‚Äù it said.

China has been upset at U.S. freedom of navigation operations near Chinese controlled islands in the disputed South China Sea, where China has been reclaiming land, building air bases and increasing its military presence. ‚ÄúWhile the U.S. Navy is becoming a dangerous obstacle in Asian waters, China has been making joint efforts with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to draw up a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea and it has boosted navigational safety by constructing five lighthouses on its islands,‚Äù the China Daily said. ‚ÄúAnyone should be able to tell who is to blame for militarising the waters and posing a threat to navigation.‚Äù

It can be pretty tough sitting on the sidelines: Usman Khawaja,"Usman Khawaja is a part of the Australian team which is set to play a two-Test series against Bangladesh. (Source: AP) Usman Khawaja is a part of the Australian team which is set to play a two-Test series against Bangladesh. (Source: AP)

Australian batsman Usman Khawaja has revealed that he sometimes finds it frustrating to remain on the sidelines. After being dropped for the India tour, he now finds himself in the reckoning in the Bangladesh series and knows how important it is.

Speaking to News Corp, he said, ‚ÄúProving myself is the furthest thing from my mind. I‚Äôm not going to make it all about me and I never like playing cricket that way. It should feel like a long time between matches, but it actually doesn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know why.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt can be pretty tough sitting on the sidelines. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs happened now and didn‚Äôt happen about eight years ago. It was frustrating at the end of India because I was there for so long. But by the time I came home it was just nice to be home, sleeping in my own bed and training back in Brisbane,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frustrating but it‚Äôs hard because I haven‚Äôt really got to play on (spinning wickets) much and even training in the nets you can only do so much,‚Äù Khawaja said and added, ‚ÄúAt the end of the day it‚Äôs not easy for any Australian going over there because it‚Äôs very uncommon for us to play in those conditions.

‚ÄúYou see the guys who have been there a lot like Smudger (Smith) who obviously does very well there. The more you play on them the better you get., he further added.

It may be recalled here that Khwaja had earlier spoken about how he wanted to test his skills in the middle and said (in an interview with cricket.com.au), ‚ÄúYou can work on specific areas, which I did when I was over there as I always do, but at the end of the day you‚Äôve got to be playing cricket games to test yourself and put yourself under a bit of pressure‚Äù.

Purists eager for fight after Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor,"The backlash is out there, even as the relentless hype switches into another gear. (Source: AP) The backlash is out there, even as the relentless hype switches into another gear. (Source: AP)

Floyd Mayweather Jr.‚Äôs fight with Conor McGregor is a joke, a spectacle that has little to do with real boxing. No reason to spend two cents on it, much less $100, when there‚Äôs a real super fight coming up a few weeks later between Gennady Golovkin and Canelo Alvarez.

The backlash is out there, even as the relentless hype switches into another gear. It‚Äôs one reason that plenty of tickets remain available a week before the fight, and entire rows of $150 closed-circuit seats remain available at hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.

Yes, the pay-per-view sales will be massive simply because of the freak show nature of the event. We love our reality TV, and it doesn‚Äôt get any more real than two colorful personalities who know how to talk the talk stepping into the unknown in a boxing ring.

It might even be somewhat competitive, if you believe UFC fans who don‚Äôt seem to get the concept that their man is a boxing novice going up against the master defensive fighter of his generation.

Boxing purists, though, may be saving their money for Golovkin and Alvarez. ‚ÄúIf you are one of those die-hard boxing fans you might be waiting for that one,‚Äù said StubHub spokesman Cameron Papp, in analyzing the slow ticket sales at least so far in the secondary ticket market.

Golden Boy promoter Oscar De La Hoya certainly hopes so. He made the Sept. 16 GGG-Canelo fight at the same T-Mobile arena Mayweather and McGregor will compete before that event became a reality..

De La Hoya who helped make Mayweather a star when the two men fought in 2007 blasted the McGregor bout as a farce when it was being negotiated and urged boxing fans not to buy it, saying ‚ÄúOur sport might not ever recover.‚Äù

Indeed, there‚Äôs some evidence that boxing fans aren‚Äôt putting their money into what they see as one-sided event, at least yet. Ticket prices are dropping quickly and the closed-circuit seats that sold out in one day for Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are available in plentiful supply from the original sellers.

Meanwhile, host hotel MGM Grand has cut its room prices three times for the weekend, and there are hotel rooms readily available on the Las Vegas Strip for less than $200.

But promoters and Showtime executives believe there is enough excitement being generated that the pay-per-view even at a cost of $99.95 could exceed the record of 4.6 million set by Mayweather-Pacquiao.

‚ÄúThere are the boxing purists who aren‚Äôt as enthusiastic about this fight, and I understand that,‚Äù said Stephen Espinoza, who heads the sports division at Showtime. ‚ÄúBut I think that‚Äôs more than compensated by the huge crush of mainstream interest in the event. The event as a whole remains compelling. It‚Äôs something we‚Äôve never seen before and no one can reliably predict how it is going to go.‚Äù

Many in the boxing press have made that prediction, writing that the fight is a mismatch and McGregor doesn‚Äôt stand a chance. That led Mayweather‚Äôs promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, to scold writers at his media day for hurting boxing by being too negative about the fight.

‚ÄúFloyd has single-handedly put boxing on his back. (He‚Äôs) the reason boxing is being talked about, as much as it is,‚Äù Ellerbe said. ‚ÄúJust imagine the two years Floyd‚Äôs been gone, where was boxing then? With the exception of Canelo and the little fight he had, people weren‚Äôt really talking about boxing. The minute you mention Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor, then this thing opens back up.‚Äù

The best guess is, no matter how many boxing fans boycott the fight, it will do monster pay-per-view numbers from UFC fans and from the simply curious who want to invite a few friends over to watch the spectacle unfold. That will be enough to elevate it to Mayweather-Pacquiao status, even if it doesn‚Äôt fare as well at the box office in Las Vegas.

But that may say more about America‚Äôs appetite for reality TV and spectacle than it does about the two sports themselves.

Rocket strikes downtown Kabul: Report,"A rocket struck the heart of Kabul‚Äôs government and diplomatic area on Monday night, setting off alarms and sirens at foreign embassies, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Police said the rocket landed on a secure road just outside the presidential palace and near an area housing other Afghan government offices, foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of the international military coalition.

The blast was preceded by ‚Äúincoming‚Äù announcements on loudspeakers, often used by the American embassy to warn of an imminent rocket attack.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Taliban and Islamic State militants have stepped up attacks on the Afghan capital, making it the country‚Äôs deadliest city for civilians this year.

Monday‚Äôs rocket strike came just hours before U.S. President Donald Trump was to give a prime-time speech outlining the future of the American presence in Afghanistan.

US military commanders have asked for several thousand more troops to help train and assist Afghan security forces struggling to contain the growing Islamist insurgency.

On Love and Desire,"Amitava Kumar during his book Launch ‚ÄòThe Lovers ‚Äò in New Delhi on Wednesday, Auguct 09, 2017. (Express photo by Abhinav Saha) Amitava Kumar during his book Launch ‚ÄòThe Lovers ‚Äò in New Delhi on Wednesday, Auguct 09, 2017. (Express photo by Abhinav Saha)

Amitava Kumar‚Äôs new novel maps the journey of a young man, Kailash, in ‚ÄúReagan‚Äôs America‚Äù as he searches for love and meaning in life. Woven within the fabric of a larger political narrative, Kumar calls The Lovers (Aleph Book Company, Rs 599), an ‚Äúin-between novel‚Äù ‚Äî somewhere between fiction and non-fiction. ‚ÄúIt speaks about the current situation, in the sense that it gives immigrants a voice. Not just a voice but a voice on their own terms. My narrator doesn‚Äôt simply declare his right to live there, he wants the right to love too,‚Äù says Kumar, who recently launched the book in Delhi.

In The Lovers, Kumar says, he has written about love and desire like never before. ‚ÄúI am getting old and I thought the body forgets. Through this book, I wanted to remember who I was. When I went to the US, I always thought that I would come back soon, but time kept passing. So I also thought that I must write about my life in the US, the 30 years that I have been there,‚Äù says Kumar, whose previous books include Home Products (2010) and non-fiction works such as Husband of a Fanatic (2004) and Passport Photos (2000), among others.

In the novel, Kailash‚Äôs professor and mentor, Ehsaan Ali, plays a pivotal role. Ali‚Äôs character was inspired by political scientist and anti-war activist Eqbal Ahmad, who was born in Bihar and moved to Pakistan after Partition. Ahmad studied in the US and ended up teaching there. ‚ÄúI never met him, but he has been an inspiring figure for me, not only because he was born in Bihar but because he embodied a radical cosmopolitanism,‚Äù says the Arrah-born author.

Cover of Amitava Kumar‚Äôs book The Lovers Cover of Amitava Kumar‚Äôs book The Lovers

In the US and the UK, the book has been published with a different title ‚Äî Immigrant, Montana. ‚ÄúI think it was David Davidar who chose this title (The Lovers). I like it because my narrator says he tore out a page from a magazine in the library that had Picasso‚Äôs The Lovers printed on it. This was the painting that Picasso did after first making love,‚Äù says Kumar, 54, who is currently the Helen D. Lockwood Professor of English at Vassar College in New York‚Äôs Poughkeepsie.

As a graduate student in the US in the late 1980s, Kumar maintained a journal that has served as inspiration for the novel. ‚ÄúI saved many letters from that time, some of them were written by women, which I was surprised to discover. It also includes some letters by my mother. But reading those letters was depressing ‚Äî the past coming back at you like that. So I left those. Instead, I used to read the book My Mistress‚Äôs Sparrow is Dead, a collection of short stories. I read one story each day and wrote the next day. In other words, I used literature to call back some memories and also imagine other things,‚Äù he says.

(Source: WWE) The fatal four-way match did not go down well for Lesnar as Strowman took a special liking for him. (Source: WWE)

The fatal four-way match between Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman and Samoa Joe had the perfect ingredients to deliver a match full of excitement. After all the hype not only did it did live to the expectations but also surpassed it. But one man who stole the limelight and stood tall among all was Braun Strowman.

Strowman was the wrecker-in-chief as he completely destroyed anyone who came in his path. While Strowman has faced Roman Reigns and Samoa Joe before, it was the first time that he came face to face with the beast incarnate. However, things did not go down well for Lesnar as Strowman took a special liking for him.

Not often do you see Brock Lesnar take a beating but on Monday he was simply manhandled by the mountain of a man ‚Äì Braun Strowman. Before Lesnar was completely annihilated by Strowman, the 6-foot plus giant was dominating the match. He speared Reigns through the barricade and seemed well on top. But it was then that Strowman hit Lesnar with a powerslam. Not one but two of them. To top it all he then threw an announcer table over Lesnar which left the WWE universe gasping in awe while Paul Heyman was left begging for mercy. As a result, Brock Lesnar had to be taken off on a stretcher.

Madhya Praedesh to compensate farmers selling at lower than MSP,"Representational Image Representational Image

The Madhya Pradesh government is set to roll out a populist scheme to compensate farmers when they are forced to sell their crops below the minimum support price (MSP) in mandis. The move by the government comes after recent protests by farmers over better minimum support price for produce. Under the scheme, that is likely to be cleared by the cabinet at its Tuesday meeting, the government will directly deposit in a farmers‚Äô bank account the difference between the MSP and a modal price decided after taking into account the average selling price in three big mandis over two months or so.

To begin with, nine kharif crops, including soybean, groundnut, maize, sesame, moong and arhar, have been covered under the scheme that will be extended to some rabi crops, depending on the outcome of the pilot. These commodities will be sold between October 16 and December 15. The farmers will be paid the difference after December 15.

The registration of farmers will begin from September 1. Besides personal details like phone number, bank account details and Aadhaar number, the farmers will have to share details of cultivation and acreage. While making the actual payment, the average yield in that particular district will be taken into account to discourage misuse of the scheme by farmers and traders, sources told The Indian Express.

Explaining the scheme, an officer said if the MSP for soybean is Rs 3,050 per quintal and a farmer sells it for Rs 2,200, he will not get Rs 850 but Rs 550 if the average rate that prevailed in big mandis of three states over a certain period of time is Rs 2,500 per quintal.

Calling the scheme Mukhyamantri Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana, Chief Minister Shiraj Singh Chouhan said giving remunerative price was the highest priority of his government. He admitted that the government does not want to saddle itself with actual procurement because it keeps staff busy for days, farmers have to queue up outside procurement centres in addition to difficulties like lack of storage capacity.

Former agriculture director G S Kaushal said the scheme is fraught with complications and likely to have its share of irregularities. ‚ÄúWhat if traders refuse to buy in mandis. They can‚Äôt be forced,‚Äô‚Äô he said, adding that he had doubts about the scheme. Shivkant Dixit of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), an organisation affiliated with the RSS, said the scheme will work in a big way. In the last few years, the state claims to have scripted a remarkable growth in agriculture.

Armed group stopping migrant boats leaving Libya,"July and August are peak months for migrant boats because of favourable sea conditions. (Source: AP) July and August are peak months for migrant boats because of favourable sea conditions. (Source: AP)

An armed group is stopping migrant boats from setting off across the Mediterranean from a city west of Tripoli that has been a springboard for people smugglers, causing a sudden drop in departures over the past month, sources in the area said. The revelation throws new light on the sharp reduction in migrant arrivals from Italy, which took over from the Aegean route as the main focus of European concerns in the crisis.

Arrivals in Italy from North Africa, the main route for migration to Europe this year, dropped by more than 50 percent in July from a year earlier, and August arrivals so far are down even further. July and August are peak months for migrant boats because of favourable sea conditions. Sources in Sabratha, 70 km (45 miles) west of the capital, said the sudden drop had been caused by a new force in the seaside city, which is preventing migrants from leaving, often by locking them up.

The group in Sabratha ‚Äúworks on the ground, the beach, to prevent the migrants leaving on boats towards Italy,‚Äù said a civil society organiser from the city, speaking on condition of anonymity. The group is made up of several hundred ‚Äúcivilians, policemen, army figures,‚Äù he said. It is conducting a ‚Äúvery strong campaign‚Äù that was launched by a ‚Äúformer mafia boss‚Äù, said a second Sabratha source who follows smuggling activity closely. A third source with contacts in Libya, who also asked not to be named, said the Sabratha group was making ‚Äúa significant effort to police the area‚Äù. The two Sabratha sources said the group was running a detention centre for migrants who are turned back or taken from smugglers. One sent a picture of hundreds of migrants sitting in the sand in front of a high wall.

One of the sources said he thought the group was seeking legitimacy and financial support from Tripoli, where European states have tried to partner with a U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) to stem migrant flows. An official from the interior ministry‚Äôs department for combating illegal migration in Sabratha did not respond to a request for comment. It was not possible to contact the group, which the third source said was called Brigade 48, although other sources did not confirm this. Italy has been trying to bolster the GNA‚Äôs ability to stop people smuggling with cash, training and by sending a ship to help repair Tripoli‚Äôs coastguard and navy vessels. Some 600,000 migrants have reached Italy by sea from North Africa since 2014, testing the country‚Äôs ability to cope. More than 12,000 have died trying.

Most leave from Libya‚Äôs western coast. Following a local backlash against smugglers in Zuwara in the west in 2015, Sabratha became the most frequently used departure point. Italy wants to replicate a deal with Libya that the EU struck with Turkey last year, largely shutting down the migrant route through Greece and the Balkans. With a national election looming during the first half of next year, the government in Rome is under pressure to show it can stop, or at least slow, migration.

But any progress in Libya is likely to be fragile, with the country in a state of conflict since Muammar Gaddafi was ousted six years ago. Rival governments are vying for power and local militias battle each other for territory and smuggling profits. Last week Italy seized on the drop in arrivals, with Interior Minister Marco Minniti saying he saw a ‚Äúlight at the end of the tunnel‚Äù.

LEAVING POINT SHIFTS

Migrants rescued last week in the Mediterranean confirmed that conditions had changed in Sabratha, according to a spokesman at the International Organization for Migration, which interviewed migrants who arrived in Trapani, Sicily, on Saturday. ‚ÄúThey said that it was very difficult to depart from Sabratha. There are people stopping the boats before they set out, and if they get out to sea they‚Äôre immediately sent back,‚Äù said Flavio Di Giacomo, an IOM spokesman in Rome. Some migrants were also turned back before reaching Sabratha, he said. The European Union‚Äôs border control agency Frontex last week said ‚Äúclashes in Sabratha‚Äù contributed to July‚Äôs decline, also citing changeable weather and increased Libyan coastguard presence. The Sabratha sources were not aware of any clashes.

Another shift in recent weeks has been a clampdown on smuggling of Bangladeshi and North African migrants through Tripoli‚Äôs Mitiga airport, after a militia that controlled the trade was forced out by a GNA-aligned armed group at the start of July, Libyan and European officials said. But that, like a slowing of flows into Libya through Niger, might take time to take effect. Hundreds of thousands of migrants are already in Libya. In Sabratha, the changes may not stick. In the past, with no central authority to constrain them, smugglers have adapted and routes have shifted, as already is happening.

Last week smugglers moved departures to east of Tripoli, near Al Khoms, Chris Catrambone, co-founder of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) charity, told Reuters. Three large rubber boats set out from the east, he said, while only a small boat with 26 people was found west of Tripoli. ‚ÄúThe sea was like a lake last week and yet there were few boats,‚Äù Catrambone said. Everyone on the Phoenix, a rescue vessel operated by MOAS, was taken aback because it was so unusual, he said.

The GNA has little control over armed groups in western Libya, including the capital, and none over factions that control the east of the country. The civil society member from Sabratha said the new group there might stop working if it does not receive support from Tripoli. The power of the smuggling networks would not be broken until there was a ‚Äúlegitimate source of order‚Äù in Libya, said a senior diplomat, speaking of the change in Tripoli airport and comparing the situation to broken vase. ‚ÄúIn one corner we stuck it together, but everything else is in pieces.‚Äù

Alleged ‚Äòtampering‚Äô by Los Angeles Lakers under investigation,"Within an hour of an initial report about Paul George‚Äôs intentions to leave the Pacers, Magic Johnson tweeted ‚ÄúGod is good!‚Äù (Source: AP) Within an hour of an initial report about Paul George‚Äôs intentions to leave the Pacers, Magic Johnson tweeted ‚ÄúGod is good!‚Äù (Source: AP)

The NBA is investigating the Los Angeles Lakers for alleged tampering involving Paul George after the Indiana Pacers filed a formal complaint.

The league released a statement Sunday from Mike Bass, executive vice president of communications. ‚ÄúAt the request of the Indiana Pacers, the NBA opened an investigation into alleged tampering by the Los Angeles Lakers,‚Äù the NBA statement said.

‚ÄúThe independent investigation is being conducted by the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. The Lakers have been cooperative and, at this point, no findings have been made. We have asked both teams to refrain from commenting while the investigation is ongoing.‚Äù

Peter Vecsey on Patreon reported Saturday that Lakers president Magic Johnson, general manager Rob Pelinka and owner Jeanie Buss were contacted by an investigator for the NBA and asked to provide ‚Äúany correspondence pertaining to‚Äù George, his agent and his parents.

‚ÄúAs the NBA‚Äôs statement made clear, we cannot comment about the specifics of any ongoing investigation,‚Äù the Lakers said in a statement.

‚ÄúWe can confirm, however, that we are cooperating fully with the NBA in the hope of clearing our name as soon as possible.‚Äù

The Pacers declined to comment when contacted by The Indianapolis Star on Sunday. George‚Äôs agent contacted the Pacers on June 18 and informed the team that George would not return after his contract expired following the 2017-18 season and that his preference was to play for his hometown Lakers.

When contacted in June, a source told The Indianapolis Star the Pacers were more concerned about finding a trade for George. The Pacers dealt the All-Star forward to the Oklahoma City Thunder on June 30 in exchange for guard Victor Oladipo and forward Domantas Sabonis.

George, who is from Palmdale, Calif., previously mentioned his admiration of Lakers legends Johnson and Kobe Bryant. Within an hour of an initial report about George‚Äôs intentions to leave the Pacers, Johnson tweeted ‚ÄúGod is good!‚Äù Johnson also acknowledged in a late-night TV interview in April that he would welcome George as a Laker.

A lamp at the top of the Elizabeth Tower which houses the UK‚Äôs iconic Big Ben will be switched off for the first time in more than 70 years, authorities said today. Located above the Great Bell known as Big Ben, the Ayrton Light ‚Äì which is switched on in the evening whenever Parliament is sitting ‚Äì needs to be fully dismantled and restored. A temporary light will replace it, the House of Commons has said.

Installed in 1885, the historic lamp was previously turned off only during both world wars. Big Ben will not chime regularly until 2021 because of repairs to the tower, the BBC reported. The light is said to have been installed at the request of Queen Victoria, so that she could see from Buckingham Palace when members of either the Commons or the Lords were sitting after dark.

The lamp is named after Acton Smee Ayrton, a Liberal politician who was First Commissioner of Works between 1869 and 1873. It is not yet known when the light will switch off, or how long it will be off for.

Big Ben will go silent from midday on Monday. The House of Commons has said it will look again at the length of time it will be silenced after ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù. Parliament said it had to protect workers carrying out the renovations.

But Prime Minister Theresa May said ‚Äúit can‚Äôt be right‚Äù that the bell will not chime regularly again for four years. It will still sound for important events including New Year‚Äôs Eve and Remembrance Sunday.

Pradeep Kumar, 24, woke up to a call by a police officer that a man had drowned in the lake, which he has been cleaning for over two years. He ran to the spot and fished out the body. But this isn‚Äôt the first body he has fished out ‚Äî in March, Kumar was called in after an elderly woman slipped and fell into the lake and drowned.

Kumar lives with his family at Hauz Khas Village, and gets paid by a private contractor for cleaning the lake. ‚ÄúI woke up to the news that a man had drowned,‚Äù said Kumar, who hails from Bihar and lives with his parents and siblings.

‚ÄúA huge crowd had gathered and divers were conducting the operation. I jumped in the water as well and started looking. The body was deep inside, about 10 metres away from the bank. I had to go 12-15 feet under the surface,‚Äù said Pradeep. ‚ÄúThe water here is choppy and a lot of broken branches fall into the lake. There are some broken boats too. It‚Äôs not easy for government divers to conduct a search operation here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSince it‚Äôs my job to clean the lake, I have to keep diving into the water,‚Äù he said.

Kumar‚Äôs colleague said a taller fence around the lake can help avert such incidents. ‚ÄúWe ask people to stay away but they don‚Äôt listen. Sometimes they sit on branches, at other times they scale the fence and play near the lake,‚Äù he said.

"‚ÄòIraq begins battle to retake Tal Afar, Islamic State bastion near Mosul‚Äô","In this Nov. 20, 2016 file photo, Popular Mobilization Units fighters ride on the back of a truck on their way to fight against Islamic State militants in the airport of Tal Afar, west of Mosul, Iraq. (AP Photo/Felipe Dana, File) In this Nov. 20, 2016 file photo, Popular Mobilization Units fighters ride on the back of a truck on their way to fight against Islamic State militants in the airport of Tal Afar, west of Mosul, Iraq. (AP Photo/Felipe Dana, File)

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced early on Sunday the start of a battle to retake Tal Afar, a key Northern Iraqi bastion of the Islamic State (IS) group and one of their last remaining strongholds in the region. The announcement comes a month after the capture by Iraqi forces of second city Mosul further east in a major blow to the jihadists.

In a televised speech, Abadi, dressed in military uniform and standing in front of an Iraqi flag and map of the country, announced ‚Äúthe start of an operation to free Tal Afar‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am saying to Daesh that there‚Äôs no choice other than to leave or be killed,‚Äù he said, using an alternative name for IS. ‚ÄúWe have won all our battles, and Daesh have always lost,‚Äù he said, telling the country‚Äôs troops that ‚Äúthe entire world is with you.‚Äù

Tal Afar is located 70 kilometres (43 miles) west of Mosul, where US-backed government forces ended jihadist rule in July after a months-long battle. In June 2014, IS jihadists overran Tal Afar, a Shiite enclave in the predominantly Sunni province of Nineveh, on the road between Mosul and Syria.

At the time it had a population of around 200,000, but local officials said it was now impossible to know the exact number still living inside the city as most are cut off from the outside world. However, authorities have accused the approximately 1,000 jihadists in the city of using civilians as human shields during Iraqi and coalition air strikes earlier this week in preparation for the ground assault.

Abadi said that Iraq‚Äôs paramilitary Hashed al-Shaabi forces would help various army, police and counter-terrorism units in Tal Afar.

The umbrella organisation, which is dominated by Iran-backed Shiite militias, has already been fighting to retake a number of other Iraqi cities from the Islamic State. ‚ÄúIn the early hours, the guns and flags turned towards their targets,‚Äù said Ahmed al-Assadi, a spokesman for Hashad. ‚ÄúVictory is near‚Äù in Tal Afar, an ‚ÄúIraqi city taken hostage and humiliated for years by attacks from these barbarians,‚Äù he said.

IS overran large areas north and west of Baghdad in 2014, but Iraqi forces have since regained much of the territory. Once Tal Afar is retaken, Iraqi authorities intend to launch a fight to retake jihadist-held Hawija, in the province of Kirkuk, 300 kilometres north of Baghdad. Jihadists still hold areas in Anbar, a western province that faces major security challenges.

IS, which declared a cross-border ‚Äúcaliphate‚Äù encompassing swathes of Iraq and Syria three years ago, has also suffered major setbacks in Syria, where around half of IS‚Äôs de facto Syrian capital Raqa has been retaken by US-backed fighters. But divisions across political, religious and ethnic lines will again rise to the surface in Iraq after the extremist group is driven out of its last bastions, experts have said.

A Place Called Home,"Sana Nasir‚Äôs illustration titled The Inside-Out Place. Sana Nasir‚Äôs illustration titled The Inside-Out Place.

Delhi-based artist Pakhi Sen has spent a large part of her life in the coastal landscape of Goa, in a home with ceramic tiles, surrounded with forests, where light filtered through glass panels to create patterns. She remembers reading in her large verandah with the music of American jazz saxophonist John Coltrane playing in her head. In her work titled The Old Pereira House, she paints two images of Goa ‚Äî one being what she imagines a perfect Goan house to be, and the other based on her recollections, a composition with negative colours and blurred boundaries.

Sen is one of the 12 artists who have explored the ‚Äúidea of home‚Äù in the first physical exhibition, titled ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, organised by The Pind Collective, an online collaborative platform that brings together artists from India and Pakistan, to share art, poetry, movies, illustrations and stories on common themes. ‚ÄúInitially, we connected with contemporaries in India whose work we like and respect. We then connected with artists in Pakistan through friends,‚Äù says Avani Tandon Vieira. The 22-year-old writer co-founded the collective with filmmaker Ansh Ranvir Vohra in July 2016.

While Vieira looks after the text, Vohra takes care of the visuals and collaborates with artists. His movie, Fazal Ka Bangla, is also being screened at the exhibition in Delhi, where he has shared memories of the Partition narrated by his maternal grandmother, Nirmal Chawla, who migrated from Pakistan to India in 1947. ‚ÄúWe also asked artists to create works in response to what others had done,‚Äù says Vohra, 24. In response to his movie, Sana Nasir, a Pakistani artist, has created an illustration titled The Inside-Out Place, that compares Chawla‚Äôs journey to India with her own grandmother‚Äôs journey to Pakistan. Similarly, Delhi-based poet Sthira Bhattacharya has responded to Sen‚Äôs painting with a poem, Surrounded, where she has explored spaces that lie between home and the unknown ‚Äî lush vegetation, unweeded gardens, rubble and ant hills.

Fawad Khan, a dastango in Pakistan, has filmed himself narrating a short story, Haveli, written by Urdu humourist, Mushtaq Ahmed Yusufi, where Qibla, a short-tempered, well-built man, who thought everyone else is beneath him, had to leave his haveli in Kanpur after Partition. Similarly, in Dairy of a Vagabond/Jis Desh Main Ganga Behti Hai, Karachi-based historian Sarah Hashmi, has sketched structures of homes left behind in India by refugees to Pakistan.

‚ÄúThe idea of the project came up after I visited Lahore for a debate competition in 2013, and realised how culturally similar both the countries are,‚Äù says Vieira. The postgraduate in English literature from the University of Oxford teaches Young India Fellowship students at Ashoka University. ‚ÄúOne year ago we didn‚Äôt really think that we would be holding a physical exhibition, and we don‚Äôt know where this project would be a year later,‚Äù says Vohra, who will soon relocate to New York for a filmmaking fellowship by Uniondocs Collaborative Studio. The Delhi-based duo, meanwhile, is also looking forward to an online exhibition based on ‚Äúresistance‚Äù. The line-up of artists will be revealed soon.

The exhibition ends today at Khoj Studios, S-17, Khirkee Extension

Switzerland is known for many things, from snow-capped mountains to Swiss chocolates, there is no dearth of reasons why one must visit the magical place. And to top that, it has now officially opened the world‚Äôs ‚Äòlongest‚Äô suspension bridge. The 494m-long pedestrian hanging bridge is perfect for hikers and for wanderers who love to explore nature at its best. But, it is not for the faint-hearted. The adventurous walk down the ‚ÄòEuropabruecke‚Äô bridge, connecting Gr√§chen and Zermatt, is at a ‚Äúdizzying height‚Äù, according to the Zermatt tourism board website.

The bridge is located along the Europaweg trail offers views of the Matterhorn, Weisshorn and the Bernese Alps mountains. The bridge will also provide an opportunity for travellers to witness the highest mountains in Switzerland the Dom (4,545m).

Gareth Bale leads Real Madrid to opening 3-0 league win without Cristiano Ronaldo,"Gareth Bale put Real Madrid in charge for good when he finished off the rebounds of back-to-back shots by Luka Modric and Karim Benzema. (Source: AP) Gareth Bale put Real Madrid in charge for good when he finished off the rebounds of back-to-back shots by Luka Modric and Karim Benzema. (Source: AP)

Cristiano Ronaldo wasn‚Äôt missed by his team as Gareth Bale scored one goal and set up another to help Real Madrid start its defense of the Spanish league title with a 3-0 win at Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday.

Madrid‚Äôs easy win was only marred by Sergio Ramos being sent off in stoppage time when he picked up his second yellow card for elbowing an opponent‚Äôs head.

After withstanding Deportivo‚Äôs early surge, Bale showed Madrid didn‚Äôt miss the suspended Ronaldo by scoring its opening goal in the 20th minute. Casemiro added a second goal seven minutes later, and Bale assisted Toni Kroos to round off the easy victory in the 63rd.

Before kickoff a minute‚Äôs silence was held at Riazor Stadium for the victims of the recent attacks in Barcelona and the nearby town of Cambrils.

Ronaldo received a five-match suspension for pushing a referee after he was sent off in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup. He was suspended for the second leg of the season curtain-raiser because of the red card. Madrid beat Barcelona 5-1 on aggregate for the title.

Deportivo striker Florin Andone twice got past Madrid‚Äôs defense in the opening minutes, but each time goalkeeper Keylor Navas turned back his shots.

Bale then put Madrid in charge for good when he finished off the rebounds of back-to-back shots by Luka Modric and Karim Benzema. Marcelo then sent a low cross behind three defenders for Casemiro to tap in at the far post to make it 2-0.

Bale turned playmaker when he cut back from the left and found Kroos arriving at the top of the area, where the Germany midfielder drove in Bale‚Äôs pass.

Andone had one last chance to beat Navas when Madrid‚Äôs Dani Carvajal fouled Bruno Gama inside the area, but Navas pushed his 90th-minute penalty kick past his post. Ramos was first booked for pushing Fabian Schar in the face during a scuffle in the 53rd.

"Garbine Muguruza, Grigor Dimitrov get their first Cincinnati titles","Grigor Dimitrov took advantage and won a title with his steady serve he was broken only once all week. (Source: Reuters) Grigor Dimitrov took advantage and won a title with his steady serve he was broken only once all week. (Source: Reuters)

Garbine Muguruza cradled her smiling face in both hands and closed her eyes, taking it all in. The Wimbledon champion had added another title to her breakthrough summer this one at the expense of a player who can‚Äôt quite get to No. 1.

Muguruza defeated Simona Halep 6-1, 6-0 for her first Western & Southern Open title on Sunday, needing only 56 minutes to extend her run of success. She also denied Halep yet another chance to move up to No. 1 in the WTA rankings.

‚ÄúHonestly, I was thinking in her situation, it must be difficult,‚Äù Muguruza said. ‚ÄúBut I wanted to win the title as well.‚Äù

On the men‚Äôs side, seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov beat Nick Kyrgios 6-3, 7-5 for his first ATP Masters title, emerging from a bracket decimated by injuries to top players.

Muguruza won her first title in the U.S. and her second of the year, along with Wimbledon. In three tournaments since, the Spaniard has at least reached the quarterfinals. Now it‚Äôs on to New York for the U.S. Open, where she‚Äôs got a history of disappointment.

‚ÄúThe tough matches never go my way, so I want to change that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI want to find the recipe this year.‚Äù It was a big disappointment for Halep the third time this season that she needed one more win to move up to No. 1 and couldn‚Äôt get it. She came up just short at the French Open and Wimbledon, and had it in the back of her mind the last few weeks.

Perhaps that had something to do with the poor showing. ‚ÄúMaybe I feel the pressure and I don‚Äôt realize it,‚Äù Halep said. ‚ÄúMaybe I just played bad. I don‚Äôt know what to say. But it‚Äôs still there. I still have a chance, so I will work for it and maybe one day it will be there.‚Äù

Halep also finished as the runner-up at Cincinnati in 2015, losing to Serena Williams. She brought a lot of momentum into this final title match. The Romanian is fully healed from a knee injury that limited her early in the season, and she didn‚Äôt lose a set all week until Sunday, when she was never in the match.

Muguruza broke her to go up 2-0 in the first set and was in control. Halep won only 12 points in the set, which lasted 23 minutes. Muguruza broke her again to open the second set and faced only two break points all match.

‚ÄúWhen I feel on court that I got dominated a little bit I felt that I cannot control the points and that‚Äôs maybe why I got a little big down in my confidence,‚Äù Halep said.

When it ended, Muguruza congratulated Halep and walked around the court with her smiling face cradled in both hands. Then she put her hands over her heart and reached toward the applauding crowd.

The women‚Äôs bracket was missing Williams, Victoria Azarenka and Maria Sharapova. Muguruza knocked off defending champion Karolina Pliskova 6-3, 6-2 in the semifinals.

The men‚Äôs bracket lacked Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and defending champion Marin Cilic because of injuries. Dimitrov took advantage and won a title with his steady serve he was broken only once all week.

Kyrgios had only two break chances and failed to convert either during the 1-hour, 25-minute final. Neither player had reached a Masters title match until this week. Dimitrov said his shoulder felt heavy as he sensed the moment and served out the match.

‚ÄúIn moments like that, it‚Äôs so difficult,‚Äù Dimitrov said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many things going through your head. Today there was a lot more on the line for me so yeah, the weight was a bit more.‚Äù

Kyrgios was delighted to reach a final after a hip injury prompted him to quit several matches this summer, including at Wimbledon.

‚ÄúWhere I was three weeks ago it wasn‚Äôt good at all and now I‚Äôm in a Masters final,‚Äù Kyrgios said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a very Nick Kyrgios thing to do. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Harbhajan Singh responds to irate home buyers after real estate firm goes under,"Harbhajan Singh defended claims by Twitter users that they received free real estate gifts. (Source: Express Photo) Harbhajan Singh defended claims by Twitter users that they received free real estate gifts. (Source: Express Photo)

Harbhajan Singh has hit back at home buyers who accused him and former India captain MS Dhoni of getting their due properties from real estate firms while many people have seen their funds and property liquified having invested in projects. The two cricketers were the faces of some of the real estate projects and like previous examples of PR crisis, the companies failed to deliver on their promises. It has thus brought into question the brand endorsers too ‚Äì in this case Harbhajan and Dhoni. Dhoni had pulled out of promoting a real estate company last year after they failed to deliver on their promises.

Some of the people who had invested into the schemes took dig at Harbhajan and the bowler did not take too kindly to the allegations.

One user wrote, ‚Äúamrapalifraud @msdhoni n @harbhajan_singh sir aap logon ka villa to mil gya free mein. Humhare to paise bhi doob rahe hai @avhflatbuyers (Sir you are getting villas for free while we are losing money),‚Äù on Twitter.

In response, Harbhajan said: ‚ÄúBhai tujhe kisne bola hamme villas mil Gaye hai? thenga Mila hamme.Bawakoof banaya gaya. Hamare naam ko use karke public k paise mare Gaye hai (who told you we got villas? We got nothing. We were fooled and our names were used to make money from the public).‚Äù

Meanwhile another user alleged Dhoni was a ‚Äògood friend‚Äô of the company boss, so Harbhajan should not lie. The India spinner replied, ‚ÄúHe could be his friend but not mine.. so you better ask him not me.. use ur brain if u have thoda sa bi‚Äù.

The same firm had allegedly promised to gift villas to the 2011 World Cup winning team which also included Harbhajan. However the off spinner later claimed that no villas were ever given.

Irregularities in SRA scheme: Probe against Prakash Mehta reaches Raj Bhavan,"Mehta had issued orders ignoring the bureaucracy‚Äôs red flag, which had said that the rules do not permit such a conversion, and that Mehta lacked powers to take any such decision. Mehta had issued orders ignoring the bureaucracy‚Äôs red flag, which had said that the rules do not permit such a conversion, and that Mehta lacked powers to take any such decision.

MAHARASHTRA‚Äôs Governor, Ch Vidyasagar Rao, will play a key role in the probe ordered against state‚Äôs housing minister Prakash Mehta. According to information, Rao is all set to invoke special powers conferred on the Governor‚Äôs office to grant more rights to the Maharashtra Lokayukta, who would be conducting the probe. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had earlier announced a Lokayukta-led probe into the allegations of irregularities by Mehta while sanctioning a proposal related to an SRA scheme in South Mumbai. But senior government sources said that Rao‚Äôs office will now issue orders to Lokayukta, M L Tahaliyani, for investigations in this regard.

The reason for this switch: The CM is said to be keen to clear his own name in the controversy. On June 21 this year, Mehta had issued orders to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority for permitting a real estate major in South Mumbai to make use of the built-up space originally sanctioned for expansion of rehabilitation homes in a slum project for building tenements for project-affected people.

In the process, Mehta‚Äôs orders permitted the developer to retain an incentive sale area of 71,822 square feet in the upscale South Mumbai, which he would have had to otherwise forgo. Mehta had issued orders ignoring the bureaucracy‚Äôs red flag, which had said that the rules do not permit such a conversion, and that Mehta lacked powers to take any such decision. The CM later stayed the approval.

While the proposal‚Äôs file never officially travelled to the CMO, Fadnavis was dragged into the controversy since Mehta, while approving the proposal, had noted on the file that the ‚ÄúChief Minister had been briefed about the case‚Äù. After the controversy surfaced, both Mehta and Fadnavis had denied that the latter was informed about the proposal, but the Opposition has even been targeting the CM on the issue.

On August 11, Fadnavis, during the monsoon session of the state legislative Assembly, announced that the office of the Lokayukta would probe the matter. But there was a small catch. While the Lokayukta can summon or investigate other Council of Ministers in the state government, it does not have the powers to summon the CM for a probe. But the government‚Äôs legal advisors have now found a way to overcome this legal hitch.

Senior sources said that Maharashtra‚Äôs Lokayukta and Upalokayukta Act, 1971, grants the Governor special powers to confer ‚Äúadditional functions‚Äù on the Lokayukta for the redressal of grievances or eradication of corruption. Section 17 of the Act states that ‚Äúthe Governor may, by order in writing and subject to such conditions and limitation as may be specified in the orders, require the Lokayukta to investigate any action (being action in respect of which a complaint may be made under the Act to the Lokayukta), and notwithstanding anything contained in the Act, the Lokayukta will comply with such orders.‚Äù

While issuing orders for the probe, the Governor‚Äôs office will specifically ask the Lokayukta to investigate Mehta‚Äôs note pertaining to the CM. Sources said that the CM was even willing to appear before the Lokayukta to clarify his stance in this regard.

Afghanistan hails Donald Trump for breaking silence on Pakistan‚Äôs support to terror,"Afghanistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US, Hamdullah Mohib said Trump has embraced a strategy that gives Afghanistan what it needs, specifically a shift away from talking about timetables and numbers to letting conditions on the ground determine military strategy. Afghanistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US, Hamdullah Mohib said Trump has embraced a strategy that gives Afghanistan what it needs, specifically a shift away from talking about timetables and numbers to letting conditions on the ground determine military strategy.

Afghanistan today lauded President Donald Trump for breaking America‚Äôs ‚Äúsilence‚Äù on Pakistan providing sanctuaries to terrorists and embracing a strategy that gives the war-torn country what it needs. Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to the nation as commander-in-chief, ruled out a hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to end America‚Äôs longest war.

He also warned Pakistan of consequences for providing safe havens to terrorists and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. Reacting to Trump‚Äôs address, Afghanistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US Hamdullah Mohib thanked president Trump for breaking America‚Äôs silence on Pakistan, which has been harbouring terrorists for attacks against its neighbours. ‚ÄúWe welcome this decision, which is the result of intense deliberations and takes into account both our countries‚Äô needs and considerations. This is the first time a focus has been put on what Afghanistan must have to succeed, and we are grateful for this outcome,‚Äù Mohib said after Trump concluded his speech on Afghanistan and South Asia.

Mohib said Trump has embraced a strategy that gives Afghanistan what it needs, specifically a shift away from talking about timetables and numbers to letting conditions on the ground determine military strategy. He also lauded the decision to integrate America‚Äôs military, economic and political power to achieve shared goals.

The strategy also expands ‚Äúauthority to move swiftly against terrorist activities and criminal networks in place of micromanagement from Washington‚Äù and ‚Äúa breaking of the silence over Pakistan‚Äôs shelters and sanctuaries for terrorists‚Äù, the Afghan Ambassador said. ‚ÄúLike America, Afghanistan also wants an honourable and enduring outcome‚Äù to this fight, for all the Afghan, US, and NATO soldiers who have served and sacrificed to advance the cause of peace, Mohib said.

In his address, Trump slammed Pakistan for its continued support to terrorist groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so. ‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,‚Äù Trump said.

‚ÄúPakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists,‚Äù he said, in an apparent warning to Pakistan. In his speech, Trump came down heavily on Pakistan for its support to terror groups, saying Islamabad receives billions in aid from the US but continues to harbour terrorists.

‚ÄúIn the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner. Our militaries have worked together against common enemies. The Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism. We recognise those contributions and those sacrifices,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúBut Pakistan has also sheltered the same organisations that try every single day to kill our people,‚Äù he added.

Trump noted that the US has been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars but it continues to house the very terrorists that America is fighting.

‚ÄúBut that will have to change. That will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country‚Äôs harbouring of militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace,‚Äù Trump said.

Putting woes see Anirban Lahiri drop to 28th at Wyndham Championship,"Anirban Lahiri frustrated with his performance in California. (Source: File) Anirban Lahiri frustrated with his performance in California. (Source: File)

Indian golfer Anirban Lahiri‚Äôs troubles with the putter continued into the final round and he ended with a round of two-over 72, which saw him drop down 11 places to be at tied-28th at the Wyndham Championship on the PGA Tour.

The Indian ace missed a whole lot of putts inside 10 feet and totalled nine-under 271 with rounds of 65-66-68-72. He has improved two places on the FedExCup standings to 63rd. He will now feature in the Play-offs, which begin this week with the Northern Trust Championships.

At the top, Swede Henrik Stenson made a bunch of birdies on the back, four in five holes from 13th to 17th and finished with a round of six-under 64 and that helped him get to a tournament record total of 22-under 258 at Sedgefield Country Club.

A disappointed Lahiri said, ‚ÄúThis is very frustrating. It (the putting) has reached a point, where it might begin to hurt my confidence. I needed 35 today and the average has been around 32. You can‚Äôt expect to contend or win golf tournaments with that.

‚ÄúI need to do something drastic. It is hurting. The bogeys on the back nine were all because of missed putts. It was like a reverse momentum. You hit a good shot, get to the greens and within 12 feet and then walk off with a bogey. That‚Äôs how it has been.‚Äù

Stenson broke the course‚Äôs 72-hole record, set by Carl Pettersson in 2008 and matched last year by Si Woo Kim. The Swede earned USD 1,044,000 and 500 FedExCup points for his sixth win on tour and his first since the 2016 British Open.

Ollie Schniederjans shot a 64 to finish second. Webb Simpson was 18 under after a 67.

Low scores and tight leaderboards once again were the norm at Sedgefield. With seven holes left for the final pairing, four players ‚Äî Stenson, Schniederjans, Ryan Armour and Kevin Na ‚Äî shared the lead at 18 under.

But Stenson stepped up the pace with a series of birdies to lock in the title.

"Madras HC directs premise owners, management of school regarding rent arrears","Madras High Court Madras High Court

The Madras High Court today directed the family of Aiswarya Dhanush, daughter of Tamil actor Rajinikanth, to file the statement of accounts to the Advocate Commissioner regarding the rental arrears due to the owners of the premises of Ashram School which the family runs. The court also directed the owners to file their statement of accounts and advance amount received for the building from Aiswarya‚Äôs family.

Aiswarya had moved the court against locking of the school by the land owners last week for alleged non-payment of rent arrears for the premises by the family of Aiswarya. The owners of the premises told Justice CV Karthekeyan, who is hearing the case, that they had handed over the keys of the school to the security personnel there in the presence of the Principal of the school.

When the counsel for the owners of the premises informed the court that there were rent dues for which they have filed a suit, the advocate for Aiswarya Dhanush presented demand drafts for Rs 7,79,200 in favour of the owners of the premises. However, the counsel for the owners declined to accept it.

The Judge directed the Advocate Commissioner to file a report and posted the matter for further hearing to August 24.

"Two IMA cadets take ill during training exercise, die","Two gentlemen Cadets (GCs) from the Dehradun-based Indian Military Academy (IMA) died after falling ill during a training course due to ‚Äúexhaustion and dehydration‚Äù, the academy authorities said on Monday. The deaths took place on Friday and Saturday.

Seven GCs fell ill ‚Äúdue to dehydration‚Äù during Friday‚Äôs 10-km run held under the ‚ÄòPahla Kadam‚Äô exercise, conducted in Badshahi Bagh area of Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. Of the seven, Deepak Sharma (22) from Bathinda, Punjab, was rushed to the nearest local hospital in Vikasnagar, in Dehradun district, in a ‚Äúcritical‚Äù condition, where he died the same day.

The remaining six were sent to the Military Hospital in Dehradun. Of them, Nabin Kumar Chhetri (23) from Darjeeling, West Bengal, was referred to Dehradun-based Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital, where he died late Saturday night, according to a statement issued by the IMA on Monday.

The remaining five GCs admitted at the Military Hospital are ‚Äústable‚Äù, the academy stated.

‚ÄúPostmortem reports of the two cadets are awaited but prima facie evidence indicates that the deaths occurred due to heart failure,‚Äù Dehradun Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Nivedita Kukreti said.

The cadets were in the fresh batch of GCs at IMA and were undertaking training course to leave the academy as Lieutenant-rank officers. The ‚ÄòPahla Kadam‚Äô exercise was part of the course to test endurance and build stamina of the GCs. While Sharma was undergoing training in Technical Graduate Course, Chhetri was in the Regular Course.

The whole verdict,"Justice Kurian Joseph agreed with them that triple talaq must be struck down, but not because it fails the test on the anvil of Article 14 (Archive) Justice Kurian Joseph agreed with them that triple talaq must be struck down, but not because it fails the test on the anvil of Article 14 (Archive)

The Supreme Court has spoken on triple talaq and the verdict is enormously welcome for the outcome. The practice, discriminatory and unjust to women, rightly stands struck down by the court. But the verdict is illuminating and valuable also because of the deliberative process that led to it, the issues and arguments that the 5-judge constitution bench agreed upon as well as the disagreements within.

Take the differences within the ‚Äúmajority‚Äù view on the bench. While emphasising that they are looking at the question before them ‚Äúin a very narrow compass‚Äù, Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman and Uday Umesh Lalit held triple talaq to be violative of the fundamental right to equality contained in Article 14 of the Constitution.

Justice Kurian Joseph agreed with them that triple talaq must be struck down, but not because it fails the test on the anvil of Article 14. It must go, he said, because it is not an integral part of Islamic religious practice and is ‚Äúagainst the basic tenets of the Holy Quran‚Äù. In effect, no wide, overarching or immutable principle was laid down by the court ‚Äî it has not held that all personal laws must henceforth meet the constitutionality or fundamental rights or essential practices test.

At the same time, the ‚Äúminority view‚Äù of two judges, which includes, notably, Chief Justice of India J.S. Khehar, urged the courts to approach matters of personal law with ‚Äúabsolute restraint‚Äù, underlining that these laws have constitutional protection. This verdict of a rainbow bench on a crucial minority and gender issue, needs to be read in its entirety ‚Äî not by dividing it into its ‚Äúmajority‚Äù and ‚Äúminority‚Äù components and privileging the former over the latter. It must be heeded as a plural whole, every strand of which is an essential part, necessary to take forward the debate.

There is a political context to the triple talaq debate. This verdict comes three decades after a government with a decisive majority in Parliament overturned a progressive court intervention on Muslim personal law in the Shah Bano case. Since that moment in 1986, the demand for reform has only grown louder within the Muslim community, particularly among its women, and it has compelled even the All India Personal Law Board to pay attention, and, in many cases, to bend.

But more recently, the coming to power of another government with a large mandate has sparked fears of majoritarianism among the minority. The several voices in which the five-judge bench of the Supreme Court has spoken on a practice seen as intolerable to all, therefore, mirrors and speaks to the complexity of the matter and its fraught political environment ‚Äî and in doing so, offers perhaps the best chance for reform.

That the court has not unanimously or starkly framed the issue as an opposition between the constitution and personal law, may seem to some to be a missed chance to uphold constitutional values. But the lack of stridency and grand claims ‚Äî while striking down the abominable practice of triple talaq ‚Äî serves a valuable end: By acknowledging a minority‚Äôs community‚Äôs aspirations without being disrespectful of its apprehensions, it keeps open crucial spaces for reform.

"It‚Äôs hard work being a video referee, says Italy‚Äôs VAR chief","VAR cheif said that VARs should not interfere after the match ends. VAR cheif said that VARs should not interfere after the match ends.

The official responsible for implementing the use of video replays at the Italian league said on Monday that the job of Video Assistant referees (VARs) is harder than it looks.

After VARs were implemented in the Italian league this season, former referee Roberto Rosetti told Reuters, ‚ÄúIt is an irreversible process that needs to be improved in times and procedures.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter a friendly match in front of 80,000 people, a VAR told me that he had never been so tired in his life. It is another concept, a different assessment structure and it takes time and patience to do things the right way.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe technical decision was right but there was a clear error on the disciplinary side,‚Äù said Rosetti. ‚ÄúThe VAR controlled a situation where it could have been assumed that there was a serious mistake,‚Äù he said.

Rosetti said that the VAR should not intervene after the referee blows his whistle. ‚ÄúWhen the referee blows his whistle, the game stops and from that moment the VAR should not intervene. We know that every change needs a phase of adaptation, the procedures have to optimised and the time taken needs to be limited and improved.‚Äù

He had the impression that the players were ‚Äúmore restrained and accepting refereeing decisions very well.‚Äù

New Trump Afghan policy expected to ramp up pressure on Pak,"President Trump will outline the policy in a televised speech ‚Äì only the second of his time in office ‚Äì from Fort Myers Base in Virginia to an audience of soldiers and their families. President Trump will outline the policy in a televised speech ‚Äì only the second of his time in office ‚Äì from Fort Myers Base in Virginia to an audience of soldiers and their families.

United States President Donald Trump‚Äôs new policy on the war in Afghanistan, scheduled to be announced late on Monday night, is likely to include a series of measures designed to coerce Pakistan‚Äôs military and intelligence services to abandon their support of the Taliban and its affiliated jihadist networks, two separate Washington DC-based government sources have told The Indian Express.

Few operational details of the new strategy are expected to be spelt out in the speech, but the sources said the President could signal his willingness to destroy jihadist infrastructure beyond Afghanistan‚Äôs borders ‚Äì in practice, by escalating drone strikes in Pakistan‚Äôs north-west, as well as special forces raids.

President Trump will outline the policy in a televised speech ‚Äì only the second of his time in office ‚Äì from Fort Myers Base in Virginia to an audience of soldiers and their families.

His speech is also expected to announce a modest increase in troop numbers, and reaffirm its financial commitment to the Afghan military‚Äôs counter-terrorism campaign.

The speech is being watched closely by Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs national security advisors, who have been telling the United States that the fall of the Afghan government will destabilise south and central Asia.

President Trump‚Äôs decision was made at a Friday meeting on Afghanistan, where the hard line counselled by his National Security Advisor, Lieutenant-General Herbert McMaster, prevailed over more cautious voices, the sources said. A veteran of the Afghanistan war, McMaster has long argued that the Taliban cannot be defeated unless Taliban infrastructure inside Pakistan is shut down.

Following a meeting with Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa in April, McMaster publicly chastised the country‚Äôs leaders, saying that ‚Äúthe best way to pursue their interests in Afghanistan and elsewhere is through diplomacy, not through the use of proxies that engage in violence‚Äù.

Lisa Curtis, Senior Director for South and Central Asia at the National Security Council, was among those who backed McMaster on Friday, the sources said, arguing that punitive elements were needed to change Pakistan‚Äôs policies on Afghanistan, a source familiar with the discussions said.

Early in August, Curtis had met with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar, on a low-profile visit to New Delhi, for talks on regional security issues.

The meeting on Friday, the sources said, saw Defence Secretary Jim Mattis lead discussions, presenting President Trump with a series of options, ranging from the status quo, to plans for an extended, aggressive commitment in Afghanistan. Plans for imposing a variety of sanctions to punish Pakistan for supporting the Taliban, and rewards for its cooperation, were also discussed in detail.

‚ÄúI am very comfortable that the strategic process was sufficiently rigorous,‚Äù Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said en route to Jordan, where he is scheduled to meet with the country‚Äôs King Abdullah.

Friday‚Äôs meeting was preceded by a palace coup which saw the exit of President Trump‚Äôs chief strategist, Steve Bannon, a controversial far-right figure who had argued against further commitment to the war in Afghanistan. Trump‚Äôs son-in-law and key advisor Jared Kushner was also absent, in a sign the President had chosen to lean on processional military and intelligence advice.

President Trump had earlier been expected to provide strategic directions on Afghan policy to the commander of United States forces in Afghanistan, Gen John Nicholson, by mid-July. Instead, on July 19, the President reportedly sought to sack General Nicholson, demanding to know why the 16-year-old war had not been won, and sought ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù ideas from his staff.

In its most recent report to the United States Congress, the Special Inspector-General for Afghan Reconstruction reported that the Taliban and its affiliate now control 11 districts and influence 34 of Afghanistan‚Äôs 407 districts, or some 11% of the country‚Äôs territory, while the Afghan government controls 97 districts and influences 146 districts, some 60% of the country‚Äôs territory.

Helped by a string of rural bases stretching from Helmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan, Zabul and Ghazni, the Taliban are increasingly able to threaten provincial capitals ‚Äì even though jihadists remain unable to hold them for sustained lengths of time.

Though the war is described by most experts as having reached a level of stalemate, Afghan National Security Advisor Hanif Atmar said the country‚Äôs military was losing 29 soldiers a day in combat ‚Äì levels most experts concur are unsustainable in the long run.

"India‚Äôs foreign reserves at record high, accounts Development Bank of Singapore","As per provisional exchange data, foreign investors sold shares worth Rs 321 crore on net basis yesterday. As per provisional exchange data, foreign investors sold shares worth Rs 321 crore on net basis yesterday.

India‚Äôs foreign reserves continue to march to record highs, touching $393 billion early this month backed by strong foreign portfolio and investment flows, according to Development Bank of Singapore (DBS). ‚ÄúStrong year-to-date foreign portfolio ($24 billion), net investment flows ($13 billion) and lower absorption due to a narrower current account deficit have led to an increase in dollar liquidity,‚Äù the DBS noted in its daily market report.

Notably, since late 2013‚Äôs taper tantrums, the quantum of jump in India‚Äôs reserves ($100 billion) is the highest compared to its Asian counterparts, outside of Japan, the bank said. ‚ÄúIf left unsterilised, these inflows will add to the rupee appreciation pressures, with the rupee already up 6 percent so far this year, leading its BRIC (Brazil, Russia,India, China) peers,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúSoaking up these dollar flows have added to the surplus rupee liquidity in the system, albeit the latter at current levels is less of a worry to the central bank‚Äôs inflation mandate in midst of lack lustre credit growth,‚Äù the bank said in the report. Inferring from the central bank‚Äôs intervention trends,reserves are set to rise further in the months ahead.

The authorities have been active not only on the spot butalso in the forward, to minimise any immediate impact on liquidity, the DBS observed. Accordingly, spot FX (Foreign Exchange) purchases amounted to $13 billion in January-June 17, while the net forward position stood at $16 billion, bulk of the latter in the three-month to one-year bucket. Rising reserves build a buffer against external volatility, backed also by a narrower current account deficit,lowering India‚Äôs vulnerability to external risk events, the bank said.

‚ÄúHowever, a downside of this build-up is the associated costs and weak returns in midst of soft global yields. This was one of the reasons behind a reduction in the Reserve Bank of India surplus dividends‚Äô contribution to the government‚Äôscoffers, besides the cost burden associated with demonetisation and liquidity absorption,‚Äù the bank said.

"Lebanese army, Hezbollah declare offensives on Islamic State at Syrian border","The Lebanese army operation got underway at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT), targeting Islamic State positions near the town of Ras Baalbek. (File Photo) The Lebanese army operation got underway at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT), targeting Islamic State positions near the town of Ras Baalbek. (File Photo)

The Lebanese army launched an offensive on Saturday against an Islamic State enclave on the northeast border with Syria as the Lebanese Shi‚Äôite group Hezbollah announced an assault on the militants from the Syrian side of the frontier. The Lebanese army operation got underway at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT), targeting Islamic State positions near the town of Ras Baalbek with rockets, artillery and helicopters, a Lebanese security source said. The area is the last part of the Lebanese-Syrian frontier under insurgent control. The operation by Hezbollah and the Syrian army targeted the area across the border in the western Qalamoun region of Syria.

A Hezbollah statement said the group was meeting its pledge to ‚Äúremove the terrorist threat at the borders of the nation‚Äù and was fighting ‚Äúside by side‚Äù with the Syrian army. It made no mention of the Lebanese army operation. The army said it was not coordinating the assault with Hezbollah or the Syrian army. Any joint operation between the Lebanese army on the one hand, and Hezbollah and the Syrian army on the other would be politically sensitive in Lebanon and could jeopardize the sizeable U.S. military aid the country receives. Washington classifies the Iran-backed Hezbollah as a terrorist group.

‚ÄúThere is no coordination, not with Hezbollah or the Syrian army,‚Äù General Ali Kanso said in a televised news conference, adding that the army had started to tighten a siege of IS in the area two weeks ago. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most difficult battle so far waged by the Lebanese army against terrorist groups ‚Äì the nature of the terrain and the enemy,‚Äù he said, characterizing the 600 Islamic State fighters in the area as 600 ‚Äúsuicide bombers‚Äù. In a recent speech, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Lebanese army would attack Islamic State from its side of the border, while Hezbollah and the Syrian army would simultaneously assault from the other side. A commander in the military alliance fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad said that ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù there was coordination between the operations.

TIES WITH DAMASCUS

Last month, Hezbollah forced Nusra Front militants and Syrian rebels to leave nearby border strongholds in a joint operation with the Syrian army.

The Lebanese army did not take part in the July operation, but it has been gearing up to assault the Islamic State pocket in the same mountainous region. Footage broadcast by Hezbollah-run al-Manar TV showed the group‚Äôs fighters armed with assault rifles climbing a steep hill in the western Qalamoun. Lebanese President Michel Aoun was following the army operation, called ‚ÄúJroud Dawn‚Äù. ‚ÄúJroud‚Äù refers to the barren, mountainous border area between Lebanon and Syria.

Hezbollah has provided critical military support to President Bashar al-Assad during Syria‚Äôs six-year-long war. Its Lebanese critics oppose Hezbollah‚Äôs role in the Syrian war. Northeastern Lebanon was the scene of one of the worst spillovers of Syria‚Äôs war into Lebanon in 2014, when Islamic State and Nusra Front militants attacked the town of Arsal. The fate of nine Lebanese soldiers taken captive by Islamic State in 2014 remains unknown.

Shi‚Äôite Hezbollah and its allies have been pressing the Lebanese state to normalise relations with Damascus, challenging Lebanon‚Äôs official policy of neutrality towards the conflict next door.

U.S. President Donald Trump called Hezbollah ‚Äúa menace‚Äù to Lebanon and the region during a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri in Washington last month, and promised continued U.S. support for the Lebanese army

Wrestling World Championships: India eye their 12th medal in Paris,"Bajrang won gold medal at Asian Championships. (Source: Express photo) Bajrang won gold medal at Asian Championships. (Source: Express photo)

Starting Monday, 24 Indian wrestlers will be in action in Paris at the Wrestling World Championships. The wrestlers will be competing in the three categories ‚Äî Greco-Roman, Freestyle and Women‚Äôs Freestyle ‚Äî with eight wrestlers in each category.

In the men‚Äôs freestyle, India‚Äôs biggest medal hope will be Bajrang Punia who recently won the Asian Championship gold medal at the 65kg. But, more than him, it will be Sakshi Malik who will be a strong contender to medal at the World Championships.

At the Senior Asian Championships in New Delhi, Sakshi lost her final bout to settle for silver at 60kg category. This was her first major competition since winning the historic bronze medal at the Rio Olympics in 58kg category. The move up a category doesn‚Äôt do all good to her.

She has to face Rio Olympic gold medallist at 63kg Risako Kawai in that category. Sakshi had lost her final at Asian Championships against her and the Worlds can be another challenge for her.

For Bajrang, the 65kg category brings a lot of hope to medal. The 2013 World bronze medallist has a chance to become India‚Äôs first ever multi-Worlds medallist by winning a medal in Paris. For that, he has to overcome challenges of Franklin Gomez of Puerto Rico, Zurabi Iakobishvili of Georgia, Magomedmurad Gadzhiev of Poland, Alan Gogaev of Russia and Zain Rutherford of USA.

This field is weaker that what he could have actually got. Rio gold medallist Sosalan Ramonov is absent due to injury, silver medallist Toghrul Asgarov is banned for one-year while the two bronze medallists ‚Äî Frank Chamizo and Ikhtiyor Nuvruzov ‚Äî have decided to compete in 70kg.

Back to the women‚Äôs freestyle, another medal hope will be Vinesh Phogat. She was injured in her quarter-final in Rio but can look forward to make amends in Paris. She is back in her preferred 48kg category. But, she has Yui Susaki of Japan as the main contender. The 17-year-old is a three-time cadet world champ and has won all three tournaments she has taken part at the senior level.

Now, Sandeep Tomar has an outside chance in the 57kg men‚Äôs freestyle category. There are some big names missing from the field in this category but Tomar still needs to be at the top of his game to win a medal here.

As far as Greco-Roman is concerned, India have only won a bronze medal in the history of the competition. Sandeep Yadav won the medal in Budapest four years back. This year, a medal looks highly improbable but a surprise won‚Äôt be bad for India‚Äôs wrestling fans.

Here are the 24 wrestlers who will take part in the Senior World Championships at Paris from August 21 to 26.

Men‚Äôs Freestyle: Sandeep Tomar (57kg), Harphool (61kg), Bajrang Punia (65kg), Amit Dhankar (70kg), Praveen Rana (74kg), Deepak (86kg), Satywart Kadiyan (97kg), Sumit (125kg).

Women‚Äôs wrestling: Vinesh Phogat (48kg), Sheetal Tomar (53kg), Lalita Sehrawat (55kg), Pooja Dhanda (58kg), Sakshi Malik (60kg), Shilpi Sheoran (63kg), Navjot Kaur (69kg), Pooja (75kg).

Greco-Roman: Gyanender (59kg), Ravinder (66kg), Yogesh (71kg), Gurpreet Singh (75kg), Harpreet Singh (80kg), Ravinder Khatri (85kg), Hardeep (98kg), Naveen (130kg).

"US: Helicopter crew had life vests, air bottles during crash","A UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter aircrew from Wheeler Army Airfield and a fireboat crew from the Honolulu Fire Department conduct a search for five crew members aboard a downed Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter on Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017. (Petty Officer 2nd Class Tara Molle/U.S. Coast Guard via AP) A UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter aircrew from Wheeler Army Airfield and a fireboat crew from the Honolulu Fire Department conduct a search for five crew members aboard a downed Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter on Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017. (Petty Officer 2nd Class Tara Molle/U.S. Coast Guard via AP)

All five crew members aboard a Black Hawk helicopter that crashed over the Pacific had life vests and an air bottle for underwater breathing, but Army officials and rescuers searching the turbulent waters off Hawaii for days had not seen signs of life as of late Friday. Crews of Black Hawk helicopters undergo underwater crash and survival training before they come to Hawaii, said Master Sgt. Peter Mayes, a spokesperson for the 25th Infantry Division. Soldiers simulate being on board a helicopter that‚Äôs crashed into the water and learn how to free themselves.

Mayes said there was no life raft on board the helicopter because operating procedure only calls for rafts when non-crew member soldiers or people without life vests are on board. Army officials have spent days sifting through chunks of helicopter debris since the aircraft crashed during nighttime training on Tuesday.

The US Coast Guard said Friday it is searching up to 50 miles (80 kilometers) off the remote point where the UH-60 helicopter crashed west of Oahu.

Firefighters found and collected what appeared to be pieces of helicopter fuselage and a helmet earlier in the week. The Coast Guard said responders continue to find debris, but didn‚Äôt have specifics on what kind. The Navy brought remotely operated underwater vehicles and sonar to help. On Friday, they searched waters about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) off the coast, said Lt. Col. Curtis Kellogg, a spokesman for the Army‚Äôs 25th Infantry Division.

Shifting waters and swift currents spread debris from 2 miles (3 kilometers) off shore on Tuesday night to an expanded search area of at least 50 miles (80 kilometers) on Thursday. The ocean floor drops quickly off Oahu and varies throughout the search area. It is over 1,000 feet (300 meters) deep at the center of a safety zone established by the Coast Guard for the search.

The safety zone extends from a 5-mile (8-kilometer) radius around the last known location of the helicopter. The Coast Guard set it up because it‚Äôs likely to have a higher concentration of debris and be where most of the search aircraft and vessels are operating. It‚Äôs not allowing civilians to enter the area.

A Coast Guard HC-130 plane helping with the search was using radar that‚Äôs designed to search the surface of the ocean, said spokeswoman Chief Petty Officer Sara Muir. An MH-65 helicopter was using infrared technology, she said. Asked whether sharks would be a concern, Muir said there were marine predators in the area. ‚ÄúThat is expected and perfectly normal for this region,‚Äù she said.

Mario Vittone, a retired Coast Guardsman and expert on sea survival, said how long people survive in the water depends on their age, weight and health in addition to water and air temperatures. Searches in colder climates where water drops below 60 degrees (15 degrees Celsius) may get called off after a day. In Hawaii, they often last longer. Last year, a search for 12 Marines who went missing after two helicopters collided off Hawaii lasted five days. Remains of nine Marines were found. Three were never recovered.

The recovery of debris indicates the Black Hawk hit the water uncontrolled, Vittone said. This would mean there‚Äôs a low probability anyone survived but he said the rescuers can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt assume that. The two Black Hawk crews were conducting training between Kaena Point and Dillingham Airfield when communications were lost. The two helicopters are part of the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade based in Hawaii.

Fashion choice leads to arrest of Vasant Kunj burglar,"The accused, Siddharth Mehrotra. Police noticed a common thing in his photos and CCTV footage: The way he rolls up his shirt sleeves. The accused, Siddharth Mehrotra. Police noticed a common thing in his photos and CCTV footage: The way he rolls up his shirt sleeves.

Rattled BY a spate of burglaries in Vasant Kunj, several teams of south district police had been trying to crack the cases with the help of CCTV footage, when they got their first clue ‚Äî a retired bank officer‚Äôs son, arrested in Noida in 2015 in connection with seven burglaries. Investigators checked the accused‚Äôs crime dossier and found that he was out on bail. Police then started monitoring his social media profile and noticed a common thing in his photos and the CCTV footage: The way he rolls up his shirt sleeves. Eventually, police arrested three persons and solved burglaries at several high-profile homes ‚Äî including of politicians and bureaucrats.

DCP (south) Ishwar Singh identified the accused as Siddharth Mehrotra (27), Jitender Yadav (29) and Anurag Singh (24). ‚ÄúIn the last few months, there had been an increase in incidents of burglaries in Vasant Kunj. During investigation, CCTV footage was examined and records of previous burglars were scanned. While looking for information on suspects on Google, the team found out about Mehrotra, who was arrested in 2015. His face and body structure matched the CCTV footage,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúOn scanning his Facebook profile and latest pictures, we found a picture of him sitting in a Ford EcoSport during a trip to Leh on July 30. The vehicle was registered under the name of one Vikas Kumar. After procuring details, we traced Mehrotra and arrested him on August 15,‚Äù the DCP said.

Singh said Mehrotra found that at residential blocks in the area, the guards did not have intercom and vehicles entering the blocks were not checked. ‚ÄúMehrotra and Singh would enter the blocks and park the car in a safe area. They would target homes of politicians, bureaucrats and senior officers after reading the nameplate,‚Äù he said.

The DCP said Mehrotra would ring the bell and if people answered, he would say he had done so by mistake. If there was no response, he would break the door or window while Singh kept watch outside. ‚ÄúMehrotra said he was fond of living a luxurious life and buying branded clothes. He would also spend the money on gadgets and has a diploma in animation. He also owns a Chevrolet Cruze,‚Äù he said.

Zimbabwe‚Äôs first lady Grace Mugabe returned from South Africa early on Sunday, state media reported, after a 20-year-old model accused her of assault in an upmarket Johannesburg hotel room. South African police had placed border posts on ‚Äúred alert‚Äù to prevent her leaving the country, but a security source told Reuters on Friday that the wife of 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe had been granted diplomatic immunity.

Zimbabwean state media reported that the president and first lady arrived in Harare aboard an Air Zimbabwe plane in the early hours of Sunday. A source confirmed this to Reuters. A bruised Gabriella Engels has accused Grace Mugabe of whipping her with an electric extension cable a week ago as she waited with two friends in a luxury hotel suite to meet one of Mugabe‚Äôs adult sons.

President Mugabe attended a South African Development Community summit in Pretoria on Saturday, but his 52-year-old wife was not there or part of his delegation. Harare has made no official comment on the saga and requests for comment from Zimbabwean government officials have gone unanswered. The South African government has limited all official comment to the police ministry and international relations department spokespeople did not answer calls for comment.

South Africa‚Äôs main opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA), blamed the ministers of police, international relations and defence for the failure to detain Mugabe and said it wants the matter investigated. ‚ÄúThe DA will be demanding an immediate parliamentary inquiry into (the) government‚Äôs complicity in allowing Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe to flee the country in the dead of night to avoid criminal prosecution,‚Äù DA whip John Steenhuisen said in a statement.

Compounding the awkward diplomatic situation, commercial flights between Zimbabwe and South Africa were grounded on Friday and Saturday, affecting both national carriers, after unexpected checks for operating permits. South African Airways resumed flights to Zimbabwe, it said in a statement on Sunday, and an Air Zimbabwe flight also departed from Harare to South Africa on Sunday morning.

Proffesor killed boyfriend as part of sexual fantasy: Prosecutors,"These booking photos provided by the Chicago Police Department show Wyndham Lathem, left, and Andrew Warren on Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017.

The fatal stabbing of a hairstylist in Chicago was part of a sexual fantasy hatched in an online chatroom between a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee, whose plan included killing someone and then themselves, prosecutors told a Cook County judge Sunday at a bond hearing for the men. An Illinois prosecutor shared disturbing new details about the July 27 slaying, describing to the court how Trenton James Cornell-Duranleau, the 26-year-old boyfriend of since-fired microbiology professor Wyndham Lathem, was stabbed 70 times at Lathem‚Äôs Chicago condo and with such brutality that he was nearly decapitated. His throat was slit and pulmonary artery torn.

Lathem, 46, had communicated for months before with Andrew Warren, 56, about ‚Äúcarrying out their sexual fantasies of killing others and then themselves,‚Äù Natosha Toller, an assistant Cook County state‚Äôs Attorney, told the court. While the prosecutor used the plural in talking about the alleged fantasy to kill, she did not say there were other victims. Judge Adam Bourgeois Jr. at one point shook his head in apparent disgust as he listened to the prosecutor offer a chilling narrative of the slaying. He later deemed both men potentially dangerous and flight risks, ordering them to remain in jail pending trial on first-degree murder charges.

‚ÄúThe heinous facts speak for themselves,‚Äù he said. Lathem and Warren ‚Äî a British citizen employed as a financial official at the Oxford, England, university ‚Äî were dressed in their own clothes Sunday at their first court appearance in Chicago. They stood calmly, their hands behind their backs, as the prosecutor and judge spoke. Lathem paid for Warren‚Äôs ticket to travel to the United States and he picked Warren up at Chicago‚Äôs O‚ÄôHare International Airport a few days before the killing, the prosecutor said. On July 26, one day before the killing, Lathem booked a room for Warren near the condo, Toller said.

Cornell-Duranleau, a Michigan native, had been asleep in Lathem‚Äôs high-rise Chicago condo when Lathem let Warren into the 10th-floor unit around 4:30 a.m. on July 27 ‚Äî treading carefully so as not to wake the victim. As Warren stood in a doorway, Lathem crept up to Cornell-Duranleau and began plunging a 6-inch drywall saw knife into his chest and neck, Toller said. Lathem had told Warren to take video of the killing using his cellphone, but Warren did not end up recording it, the prosecutor said.

When Cornell-Duranleau awoke, he began screaming and fought back; Lathem yelled at Warren, asking him to help subdue Cornell-Duranleau, the prosecutor said. Warren ran over to cover the victim‚Äôs mouth, then struck him in the head with a heavy lamp in an attempt to silence him, Toller said. As Lathem continued to stab the victim, Warren left the room and returned with two kitchen knives, she said.

Warren bent over Cornell-Duranleau and joined Lathem in stabbing him, the prosecutor said. At one point, the victim bit Warren‚Äôs hand as he struggled to fight off the attack. She said the victim‚Äôs last words were to Lathem: ‚ÄúWyndham, what are you doing?‚Äù

While prosecutors said Lathem and Warren had concocted a plan to kill themselves after the stabbing, Toller did not say why they never followed through with it. After showering, Lathem and Warren left the apartment an hour after the stabbing began, the prosecutor said. They surrendered to California authorities on Aug. 4 after an eight-day manhunt and were recently returned to Illinois. The stab wounds to Cornell-Duranleau included 21 to the chest and abdomen, and 26 in the back, as well as multiple cuts on his hands. Cornell-Duranleau‚Äôs lungs were also both punctured, and there were wounds to his colon, spleen and liver.

After leaving the apartment and renting a car, Lathem on the same day left an anonymous $5,610 donation ‚Äî in cash ‚Äî at the Howard Brown Health Center in Chicago in the name ‚ÄòCornell-Duranleau.‚Äô They then drove to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and, 13 hours after the first payment, Lathem went to its public library and wrote a $1,000 check as a donation, also in the victim‚Äôs name, the prosecutor said. Toller said Lathem, while on the run, sent a video message to his parents and friends, admitting to the killing and telling them ‚Äúhe is not the person people thought he was.‚Äù

Lathem‚Äôs lawyer, Barry Sheppard, said in a brief statement to reporters after the hearing that people shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúengage in a rush to judgment.‚Äù He said his client had led ‚Äúa life of unblemished ‚Ä¶ citizenship,‚Äù which included academic work on the bubonic-plague virus. Warren spoke briefly when the judge asked if he wanted a British diplomatic office to be in contact. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Warren said. For the bond hearing, Warren relied on a public defender, who did not comment later.

The judge set a Tuesday hearing for the men, when another judge will be assigned to oversee the criminal case. Both would have a chance to enter pleas at a later arraignment.

(Source ‚Äì AP photo)

U.S. Navy and Marine Corps divers on Tuesday found some remains of missing sailors inside sections of a U.S. guided-missile destroyer that collided with a merchant vessel near Singapore, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet said. The USS John S. McCain and the tanker Alnic MC collided on Monday while the U.S. ship was approaching Singapore on a routine port call. The impact tore a hole in the warship‚Äôs port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area.

U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Scott Swift said an international search-and-rescue operation had found some remains and that the wider search for 10 sailors missing from the accident would continue until all hope was exhausted. ‚ÄúThe divers were able to locate some remains in those sealed compartments during their search,‚Äù Swift told reporters at Singapore‚Äôs Changi Naval Base where the USS John S McCain is docked for damage assessment. ‚ÄúAdditionally, the Malaysian authorities have reported that they have located potential remains. They are working to confirm and identify those remains.‚Äù He did not specify how many remains had been found.

The Malaysian navy said in a statement it had found a body eight nautical miles northwest of the collision site and it would transfer it to the U.S. Navy on Wednesday. Swift also said Monday‚Äôs collision ‚Äì the fourth major accident in the U.S. Pacific fleet this year ‚Äì could not be viewed in isolation from other incidents and that investigations were seeking to find a ‚Äúcommon cause at the root of these events‚Äù.

The John S. McCain‚Äôs sister ship, the Fitzgerald, almost sank off the coast of Japan after colliding with a Philippine container ship on June 17. The bodies of seven U.S. sailors were found in a flooded berthing area after that collision. The latest accident has already prompted a fleet-wide investigation and plans for temporary halts in operations.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said to have sailors killed in two collisions this year was disconcerting. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just unacceptable and we‚Äôll get to the bottom of it,‚Äù Pence told Fox News. ‚ÄúBut right now our hearts are with the families of those that are lost and we honor them.‚Äù

Ships, aircraft and divers from an international search-and-rescue operation have been looking for the missing U.S. sailors to the east of Singapore and peninsula Malaysia, near where the accident happened. Aircraft from the amphibious assault ship the USS America, which was in port at Changi Naval Base, joined the search.

Earlier on Tuesday, divers equipped with surface-supplied air rigs got into compartments in damaged parts of the USS John S McCain. Immediate efforts by the ship‚Äôs crew after the collision on Monday were able to halt flooding into other parts of the hull, the Seventh Fleet said in a statement on its website.

CNN, citing unidentified U.S. Navy officials, said early indications suggested the collision was caused by a steering malfunction as the warship approached the Strait of Malacca. Swift said it was too early to draw conclusions about the cause and whether it was the result of human error. Aircraft and vessels from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have been helping with the search.

HOLE IN HULL

Swift said the U.S. Navy was sending a team to assess the damage before making a decision whether to move the ship or place it in drydock. Singapore‚Äôs Maritime and Port Authority said it had deployed 250 personnel for the search-and-rescue effort over an expanded area of 2,620 square kilometres. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said it had deployed more than 500. Five U.S. sailors were injured in the accident, although the U.S. Navy said none of those injuries was life-threatening.

On Monday, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said there were no indications so far the collision was intentional or the result of cyber intrusion or sabotage. ‚ÄúBut review will consider all possibilities,‚Äù he said on Twitter. Richardson said he was asking his fleet commanders worldwide for a one-to-two-day, staggered ‚Äúoperational pause‚Äù to discuss action to ensure safe and effective operations. He also said a comprehensive review would examine the training of U.S. forces deployed to Japan. The U.S. Seventh Fleet is headquartered in Japan.

The accident comes at a tense time for the U.S. Navy in Asia. This month, the John S. McCain sailed within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built by China in the disputed South China Sea, the latest ‚Äúfreedom of navigation‚Äù operation to counter what the United States sees as China‚Äôs efforts to control the waters.

The state-run China Daily said in an editorial that increased activities by U.S. warships in Asia-Pacific were a growing risk to commercial shipping.

Also this month, North Korea threatened to fire ballistic missiles towards the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam in a standoff over its nuclear and missile programmes.

There is, however, no doubt The Windfall has been written primarily for an American readership. What would be trousers in India become ‚Äúslacks‚Äù.

The Windfall

Diksha Basu

Bloomsbury India

304 pages

` 499

The title of Diksha Basu‚Äôs eminently readable new novel, The Windfall, is pretty straight-forward. Anil Kumar and Bindu Jha, Mr and Mrs, are your decent, middle-class, East Delhi Uncle and Aunty, professionals, parents, neighbours, likely to register median on most national surveys. That is, until Mr Jha‚Äôs homegrown website (simplycall.com) is acquired by an American company for twenty million dollars. Said windfall sends them careening out of their comfortable if quotidian Mayur Palli housing society to a glamorous bungalow in a posh, tree-lined avenue of Gurgaon. The consequences of this almost stratospheric shift become the subject of Basu‚Äôs breezy novel-of-manners.

In Mayur Palli, one merely had to compete with the Guptas who drive a Honda Swift, or the Patnaiks who are obsessed with the notion of getting their homely daughter married to Rupak, the Jha offspring, studying towards a business degree in a private college in Ithaca. But, Rupak is failing business school and he also has an American girlfriend to boot. Basu‚Äôs Mayur Palli captures, with exactness, the sights and sounds of East Delhi that are familiar to most Delhiwallas.

In Gurgaon, though, one must keep up with the Chopras. Dinesh Chopra has recreated the Sistine Chapel in their family foyer, at great expense. Although he addresses most whims of his family-members ‚Äî his wife Geeta and ‚Äúpoet‚Äù son Johnny ‚Äî and all fancies of his own, Mr Chopra still can‚Äôt keep at bay the uneasy feeling that ‚Äúrelative‚Äù to his neighbours, he was becoming poorer. As the Jhas move in next-door, with their Japanese sofa studded with Swarovski crystals and brand new Mercedes, Dinesh Chopra and Anil Kumar Jha soon begin to mirror each other‚Äôs acquisitive obsessions, leading to bizarre scenarios.

There are two competent sub-plots. A rather feel-good one involving the changing fortunes of Reema Ray, Mrs Jha‚Äôs best friend and neighbour, a young widow who feels suffocated in Mayur Palli; and, a more nuanced one about Rupak, who is torn between his parents‚Äô changing class-status ‚Äì middle-class or newly rich? ‚Äì and two women, one Indian and one American.

There is, however, no doubt The Windfall has been written primarily for an American readership. What would be trousers in India become ‚Äúslacks‚Äù. Even more problematically, Gurgaon, that steaming city with a monster‚Äôs breath and gilded eyes, where extreme affluence and urban poverty exist cheek by jowl, becomes a ‚Äúmonolith‚Äù in Basu‚Äôs world ‚Äî all quiet, tree-lined, ‚Äúan oasis of calm‚Äù as it were. Something that an American audience would equate with affluent suburbs of New York City, perhaps? In Westchester County or Scarsdale? The real Gurgaon, of course, is no oasis of calm. Neither is it exclusively for the rich. Indeed, it was after Mayur Vihar and its obverse in the south, Vasant Kunj, became well-nigh impossible to afford, that a large chunk of the middle-classes escaped to the high-rise apartments of Gurgaon that they could afford on EMIs, so much so that these too, in due course, became ‚Äúaspirational‚Äù.

It is, of course, heartening to see a novel of this sort, gentle humour, honest story-telling, and a clever Candace Bushnell-like pulse on contemporary trends (albeit without any Candace Bushnellian emphasis on sex) do so well in the US, given it has nothing whatsoever to do with caste, terrorism or atrocities on women, the usual favoured memes. One breathes a sigh of relief as it were to see that immigrants and exotic locations are no longer what sell. However, the attendant points this raises is rather troubling. Had this novel been published only in India, it would have disappeared from the mid-list before you finished saying windfall, perhaps even unreviewed in newspapers or magazines. Must (windfalls in) Indian writing in English come to India via an MFA degree and a global (read American) launch to be read at all? What does that say about the state of the industry in India at large?

Chew on that while you read the book!

Republican Ohio Gov John Kasich urges Donald Trump to end staff chaos and ‚Äòsettle it down‚Äô,"Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich. (AP Photo/Jay LaPrete, Files) Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich. (AP Photo/Jay LaPrete, Files)

Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich urged President Donald Trump on Sunday to stop the staff chaos at the White House and ‚Äúsettle it down.‚Äù Strategist Steve Bannon last week became the latest top White House official to follow Trump‚Äôs national security adviser, a chief of staff, two communications directors and a press secretary, and others, out the door. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt keep putting new people in the lineup and think you‚Äôre going to win a world championship,‚Äù said Kasich, who is among those who think the staff churn is hampering Trump‚Äôs ability to notch a major legislative victory. He voiced his concerns on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union.‚Äù

The White House said Bannon and new White House chief of staff John Kelly had ‚Äúmutually agreed‚Äù that Friday would be Bannon‚Äôs last day. Bannon immediately resumed his role as executive chairman of the conservative Breitbart News website, which he led before joining Trump campaign.

David Bossie, a former deputy manager of Trump‚Äôs campaign, said Bannon wanted to give Kelly ‚Äúan opportunity to have a clean slate.‚Äù Bannon repeatedly clashed with other top advisers, most notably Trump‚Äôs son-in-law, Jared Kushner. He dismissed concerns that White House staff divisions are hurting Trump‚Äôs ability to get his priorities passed, saying that ‚Äúin every presidency there are factions.‚Äù Bossie blamed Republican congressional leaders instead. ‚ÄúNo one is saying the president is not leading. There‚Äôs a lack of leadership on one side of Pennsylvania Avenue,‚Äù he said on ‚ÄúFox News Sunday.‚Äù

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, urged ‚Äúmore cleaning house‚Äù at the White House, echoing some fellow Democrats in naming policy adviser Stephen Miller and national security aide Sebastian Gorka as two who should be fired. ‚ÄúThere certainly are a lot of people on the White House staff and NSC staff that shouldn‚Äôt be there, people like Miller and Gorka and others, who not only, I think, represent the same thing that Steve Bannon did but also aren‚Äôt capable of doing the job well,‚Äù Schiff said, also on CNN. ‚ÄúSo, yes, I think there‚Äôs more cleaning house that ought to take place,‚Äù Schiff added.

Schiff also questioned Trump‚Äôs capability. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some attribute of his character that makes him seemingly incapable of introspection and a broad understanding of what the country really needs. And I think it‚Äôs a question that people are asking, you know, what is going on with this president?‚Äù

The lawmakers and others spoke Sunday as Trump prepared to return to the White House after more than two weeks away.

Trump spent most of what he said was a ‚Äúworking vacation‚Äù holed up at his private golf club in central New Jersey. He also spent two nights at his home at Trump Tower, his first visit to the New York skyscraper since taking office.

Before the President departed New Jersey, the White House announced that he planned to address the nation Monday night from Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia, on US policy toward Afghanistan and South Asia. Trump and his national security team met at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland on Friday to hash out policy toward South Asia. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, traveling in Afghanistan, said Sunday that the president has agreed on a new war strategy after 16 years of conflict, but declined to discuss details before Trump announces his decision.

Trump‚Äôs upcoming week also includes travel to Arizona to visit a Marine Corps facility in Yuma and hold a campaign rally in Phoenix on Tuesday. He stops in Reno, Nevada, on Wednesday to address the American Legion convention.

Back in their states and districts for the August recess, Republican lawmakers were scarce on Sunday‚Äôs talk shows, skipping opportunities to weigh in on the president‚Äôs comments about the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and Bannon‚Äôs exit from the White House.

An exception was Sen. Tim Scott, who urged Trump to spend time with people who have lived through the nation‚Äôs difficult racial past. The South Carolina Republican had said last week that Trump had compromised his moral authority by appearing to equate neo-Nazis and white supremacists with those who came out to oppose them in Charlottesville. Trump said there were ‚Äúvery fine people, on both sides‚Äù of the clashes. Scott said the nation is in a ‚Äúvery critical and sensitive time‚Äù and that Trump‚Äôs next steps would speak louder than his words. ‚ÄúWithout that personal connection to the painful past, it will be hard for him to regain that moral authority, from my perspective,‚Äù Scott said on CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace the Nation.‚Äù

"Conor McGregor win would be ‚Äòdreadful‚Äô for boxing, says Jeff Horn","Jeff Horn said Conor McGregor would struggle to even land a punch on the undefeated American. (Source: AP) Jeff Horn said Conor McGregor would struggle to even land a punch on the undefeated American. (Source: AP)

Australia‚Äôs Jeff Horn has given Conor McGregor little chance of beating Floyd Mayweather in Saturday‚Äôs super-fight and hopes the American will ‚Äúannihilate‚Äù the mixed martial arts fighter for the sake of boxing.

Horn, who became WBO welterweight champion by beating 38-year-old Manny Pacquiao in Brisbane last month, said McGregor would struggle to even land a punch on the undefeated American.

Mayweather (49-0) has not fought in nearly two years but is a heavy favourite to surpass Rocky Marciano‚Äôs record in the Las Vegas bout, which purists have dismissed as an exhibition.

‚ÄúI hope Mayweather annihilates him and I think he will,‚Äù Horn said in comments published by News Ltd media on Tuesday. ‚ÄúIt will be dreadful for the sport of boxing if Mayweather, one of the greatest fighters of all time, gets rolled by a guy having his first fight but I can‚Äôt see McGregor doing too well even with all the hype.

‚ÄúTheir fight is going to be under boxing rules and Mayweather will probably not even get hit. If McGregor‚Äôs got any sense he‚Äôll crash tackle Floyd at the opening bell and put a choke hold on him, get disqualified and then they‚Äôll have a rematch and make even more money.‚Äù

Saturday‚Äôs fight is tipped to test the pay-per-view and revenue records set by the Mayweather-Pacquiao bout in 2015. Mayweather‚Äôs defeat of the Filipino generated over $400 million from 4.6 million pay-per-views.

After Horn‚Äôs own win over Pacquiao, the Australian immediately laid down a challenge to Mayweather, holding up a walking stick to bait the 40-year-old.

Former schoolteacher Horn is set for a rematch against Pacquiao in Brisbane later in the year but said he would ‚Äúlove a crack‚Äù at Mayweather.

‚ÄúHe could challenge me for the world welterweight title. And if McGregor wanted to fight me I‚Äôd take it right now. I wouldn‚Äôt be worried one bit,‚Äù said the 29-year-old.

Horn added that he would fight Mayweather like Marcos Maidana, who pushed the American in two defeats in 2014. ‚ÄúA few years ago we saw Marcos Maidana from Argentina give Floyd the fight of his life but Maidana didn‚Äôt have the engine to sustain it for 12 rounds,‚Äù the Australian said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd fight Mayweather like Maidana did but I‚Äôd do it for 12 rounds, not six.‚Äù

Nepal Parliament fails to endorse Constitution amendment bill,"Representational Image Representational Image

Nepal‚Äôs parliament on Monday failed to endorse the much-awaited Constitution amendment bill to address the issues of Madhesis as the ruling coalition could not garner a two-thirds majority required for its passage. In the 592-member House, 395 votes were required to get the amendment bill through. During the voting, 347 lawmakers voted in favour of the bill while 206 lawmakers voted against it. Of the total 592 lawmakers, 553 lawmakers were present during the voting.

The main opposition, CPN UML, voted against the bill. Rastriya Prajatantra Party led by Kamal Thapa, a pro-Hindu group, had also voted against the bill. The voting process commenced after the 50 proposals to amend the bill registered by various political parties were rejected by a majority.

Earlier, a total of 54 lawmakers took part in the deliberations of the bill that was forwarded to address demands raised by the agitating Madhes-centric parties who have been opposing the local elections on the ground that the new Constitution be amended to accommodate their views. They want more representation in the Parliament and redrawing of provincial boundaries.

Madhesis, mostly of Indian-origin, launched a prolonged agitation between September 2015 and February last year against the implementation of the new Constitution which they felt marginalised the Terai community.

Tens of thousands protest in Hong Kong over jailing of democracy activists,"A protester holds up a poster with an image of Chinese President Xi Jinping as thousands of protesters match to support young activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow in downtown Hong Kong Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017.

(AP Photo/Vincent Yu)

Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday to protest against the jailing of three young democracy activists, with many questioning the independence of the Chinese-ruled city‚Äôs judiciary. Joshua Wong, 20, Nathan Law, 24 and Alex Chow, 27, were jailed for six to eight months on Thursday for unlawful assembly, dealing a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompting accusations of political interference. Thousands of people marched in temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) to the Court of Final Appeal, carrying placards and banners denouncing the jailing of the activists.

Former student leader Lester Shum, who helped to organise Sunday‚Äôs rally, said the number of protesters was the highest since the ‚ÄúUmbrella Movement‚Äù pro-democracy protests in 2014 that paralysed major roads in the financial centre for 79 days. ‚ÄúThis shows that the Hong Kong government, the Chinese Communist regime and the Department of Justice‚Äôs conspiracy to deter Hong Kong people from continuing to participate in politics and to protest using harsh laws and punishments has completely failed,‚Äù Shum said.

Hong Kong police estimated 22,000 people had shown up at the height of the protest. Protesters brandished a large banner saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a crime to fight against totalitarianism.‚Äù They shouted: ‚ÄúRelease all political prisoners. Civil disobedience. We have no fear. We have no regrets.‚Äù Ray Wong, 24, who leads the pro-independence group Hong Kong Indigenous, said outrage over the jailings was helping to unite the pro-democracy opposition camp that has been riven by divisions over the past few years.

‚ÄúSince the Umbrella movement, the radical and milder forces walked their own path,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre now standing together. It is a good start.‚Äù In Sunday‚Äôs protest, some signs said ‚ÄúShame on Rimsky‚Äù, referring to Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen. Reuters reported that Yuen had overruled other legal officials when they advised against pursuing prison terms for the three activists.

NO ‚ÄúPOLITICAL MOTIVE‚Äù

Wong and his colleagues triggered the 2014 protests, which attracted hundreds of thousands at their peak, when they climbed into a courtyard fronting the city‚Äôs government headquarters. They were sentenced last year to non-jail punishments including community service for unlawful assembly, but the Department of Justice applied for a review, seeking imprisonment. On Friday, Yuen denied any ‚Äúpolitical motive‚Äù in seeking jail for the trio.

The former British colony returned to China in 1997 under a ‚Äúone country, two systems‚Äù agreement that ensured its freedoms, including a separate legal system. But Beijing has ultimate control and some Hong Kong people are concerned it is increasingly interfering to head off dissent. The Hong Kong government rejected allegations of political interference.

‚ÄúThere is absolutely no political consideration involved. Further, allegations that the court is under political interference are totally unfounded and groundless,‚Äù it said in a statement late on Sunday. The jail terms for Wong, Law and Chow disqualify them from running for the city‚Äôs legislature for the next five years, halting their push for a career in mainstream politics. Lau Siu-lai, one of six legislators expelled from the legislature this year over the manner in which she took her oath of office, said the sentences were unreasonably harsh.

‚ÄúIt appears to be political suppression to strip away young people‚Äôs right to stand in elections,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI hope people will pay attention ‚Ä¶ We need to protect Hong Kong‚Äôs rule of law.‚Äù Another protester carried a placard of Lady Justice with a red blindfold. ‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äôs Lady Justice and the rule of law‚Ä¶ are now being controlled by communists, and are now being twisted and she is now blind,‚Äù said 50-year-old artist Kacey Wong.

While the imposition of tougher sentences on the activists attracted widespread criticism in Hong Kong and overseas, the Hong Kong Bar Association and Law Society defended the court‚Äôs decision. ‚ÄúUnfounded comments that judicial decisions were made or influenced by political considerations originating outside Hong Kong are unjustified and damaging to our legal system, and to Hong Kong as a whole,‚Äù they said in a joint statement on Friday.

"Doklam standoff: China tells India to withdraw troops, rejects Rajnath‚Äôs hope for early solution","Doklam standoff: The Sikkim section has a special historical background and this is the only defined boundary between China and India, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang Doklam standoff: The Sikkim section has a special historical background and this is the only defined boundary between China and India, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang

China on Tuesday said the only way to end the Doklam standoff in Sikkim sector was for India to unconditionally withdraw its troops from the area. Beijing‚Äôs response comes a day after Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh expressed hope that China would soon make a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù move in this regard. Rajnath Singh had on Monday hoped that a solution to the Doklam standoff would be found soon and said India never attacked a nation nor did it harbour any expansionist behaviour. In a speech, he had also expressed hope that China will undertake a positive initiative to resolve the standoff. Also Read: Ladakh scuffle: The importance of Pangong Tso

China, however, kept up its propaganda onslaught on India by reiterating its accusation that Indian troops ‚Äòillegally crossed the boundary‚Äô. Hua Chunying, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, called India‚Äôs reasons to stop Chinese road building in Doklam area as ‚Äòridiculous‚Äô. In a statement to the media, Hua said: ‚ÄúSo the only prerequisite and condition of this incident is unconditional withdrawal of the Indian troops and equipment.‚Äù Also Read: Hopeful China will initiate dialogue soon, says Rajnath Singh

Hua also criticised India, saying New Delhi‚Äôs move at Doklam has a negative impact in the eyes of the Chinese people. India should match its words with deeds, Hua said while calling for unconditional withdrawal of Indian troops and equipment.

Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in a stand-off in the Doklam area of the Sikkim sector for seven weeks now after Indian troops stopped the Chinese army from building a road in the disputed area. China claimed that they were constructing the road within their territory and has been demanding immediate pull-out of the Indian troops from the disputed Doklam plateau. New Delhi has expressed concern over the road building, apprehending that it may allow Chinese troops to cut India‚Äôs access to its northeastern states.

India has conveyed to the Chinese government that the road construction would represent a significant change of status quo with serious security implications for it. Doka La is the Indian name for the region which Bhutan recognises as Doklam, while China claims it as part of its Donglang region.

Of the 3,488-km-long India-China border from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh, a 220-km section falls in Sikkim. China also claims that Thimphu has no dispute with Beijing over Doklam.

Over the last two months, the Chinese media has vigorously protested the Indian resistance to its attempt to transform the character of the territory in Doklam. In August alone, some 125 articles have been written on the Indian ‚Äútrespass‚Äù, ‚Äúhijacking a small neighbour‚Äù, and a so-called Bhutanese acknowledgement to China that Doklam actually belongs to China.

"Don‚Äôt interfere, Lingayat leaders tell RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat","RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat (File Photo) RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat (File Photo)

Leaders of the dominant Lingayat community in Karnataka, who held a huge rally on Tuesday in Belagavi to press for recognition of Lingayats as a separate religion, have asked RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat to not interfere in matters pertaining to the community. This was in reaction to recent reports that Bhagwat, during a visit to Hubbali, had advised Lingayat seers to convince community leaders to drop the demand for status of independent religion.

Speaking at the rally, Mathe Mahadevi, a woman seer who is one of the spearheads of the Lingayat movement, said the RSS chief should focus on convincing Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding their demand. ‚ÄúHe should use his influence with Modi to speed up the process of granting us the status of an independent religion,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe live according to the principles of a modern democracy and not vedic ideology like Bhagwat. We need not heed the advice of such leaders,‚Äù another seer, Basava Jaya Mrutyunjay Swami, said. He said Lingayat political leaders must not be slaves to the ideology of their parties but should follow the teachings of the 12th century saint Basaveshwara, the founder of the community.

Lingayat leader and member of the state legislative council Basavaraj Horatti said that the Lingayat community must be allowed to handle its own affairs without interference from outside.

The seer of the Gadag Tontad mutt, Siddhalinga Swami, said right-wing leaders like Bhagwat were trying to derail their movement. He said the ideals of Lingayatism and Hinduism are at cross purposes since Lingyatism is based on the premise that there can be no discrimination based on class, caste and gender.

‚ÄúWe were never part of Hinduism. So, there is no question of us walking out of the Hindu fold. We have been a separate religion for 900 years. It is only a matter of time before the government recognizes us as a separate religion,‚Äù said former IAS officer S M Jamdar who is a part of the moverment. ‚ÄúEven if Lingayats were to continue to be a part of Hinduism we would be considered Shudras. Hence there is a need to recognise Lingayatism as a separate faith,‚Äù Jamdar said.

The Lingayat community in Karnataka who make up nearly 17 percent of the state population have been key supporters of the BJP in the northern parts of Karnataka in recent years. The Congress government in Karnataka has been tacitly supporting the Lingayat demand for the status of an independent religion with several ministers participating in meetings held to further the cause.

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has stated that he is willing to recommend the status of an independent religion for Lingayats to the central government if the demand from the community is unanimous. BJP‚Äôs national president Amit Shah on a recent visit to Karnataka dismissed the Lingayat demand as a political game being played by the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in the run-up to the 2018 assembly polls in the state.

After kicking off the Trophy Experience at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium on Saturday, the official winner‚Äôs trophy was put on display at the iconic India Gate on Sunday.

The response to what is the first leg of the six-venue tour was overwhelming with people getting a chance to pose with the silverware.

Present on the occasion, Javier Ceppi, Tournament Director for the Local Organising Committee said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a fantastic start to the Trophy Experience. We have had over

"I think there is a real chance of more than one medal at World Boxing Championships, says Vijender Singh","Vijender Singh turned pro in 2015 after a good run in the amateur circuit for India. (Source: Express File) Vijender Singh turned pro in 2015 after a good run in the amateur circuit for India. (Source: Express File)

Vijender Singh feels India have a good bunch of boxers to get more than one medal at the upcoming World Boxing Championships, starting August 25 in Hamburg. The pro boxer created history when he opened India‚Äôs account at the Worlds eight years ago in Milan. India have had bronze medals at the event in the 2009, 2011 and 2015 editions. Apart from Vijender, Vikas Krishan (2011) and Shiva Thapa (2015) are the other two bronze medallists from India.

‚ÄúIt is a mature bunch of boxers. I have been in teams that had Shiva (Thapa), Vikas (Krishan) and Manoj (Kumar). So, I know some of them well. They have the ability to ensure that India ends up with more than one medal. If they compete to their full potential, I think there is a real chance of more than one medal,‚Äù Vijender told PTI in an interview.

‚ÄúThey have competed at the highest level in the past and know what they should do. I cannot give any suggestions to them but I can just say, they need to be very focussed,‚Äù he added.

Both Vikas (75kg) and Shiva (60kg) are part of the eight-member unit which has already reached Hamburg after earning their berths through the Asian Championships earlier this year.

Amit Phangal (49kg), Kavinder Bisht (52kg), Gaurav Bidhuri (56kg), Manoj Kumar (69kg), Sumit Sangwan (91kg) and Satish Kumar (+91kg) are the other members of the team. Vijender, who turned pro in 2015, has two titles in his unbeaten run in the circuit so far. Vijender feels Milan medal helped him silence critics who termed his Beijing Olympics bronze medal fluke.

‚ÄúThat bronze medal I won in Milan was part of a beautiful phase in my career because it managed to silence some harsh critics, who felt that my medal in Beijing was a fluke. There were people who said that I was not training enough, within months of my medal in Beijing.

‚ÄúTo me, focus has always meant shutting myself off before heading to a big tournament. I would just insulate myself from anything and everything that was going on outside the little space, which I would create for myself,‚Äù he explained.

Vijender urged the boxers part of the World Championships team to not allow expectations play on the mind.

‚ÄúThere will always be expectations and I am sure the guys who are competing this time, are well aware of that. But to me, the key lies in not allowing that to play on the mind. There has to be a single-minded focus on the ring, forget everything else, that‚Äôs what I do,‚Äù he said.

India‚Äôs star boxer didn‚Äôt pick his favourite but reserved special praise for Shiva, who he feels ‚Äúhas progressed tremendously‚Äù.

‚ÄúHe has progressed tremendously and seems to be a very sorted boxer. I have been impressed by his growth,‚Äù said Vijender.

Japan launches satellite for better GPS system,"An H-IIA rocket blasted off at about 2:30 pm (0530 GMT) from the Tanegashima space centre in southern Japan, according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

Japan today launched the third satellite in its effort to build a homegrown geolocation system aimed at improving the accuracy of car navigation systems and smartphone maps to mere centimetres.

An H-IIA rocket blasted off at about 2:30 pm (0530 GMT) from the Tanegashima space centre in southern Japan, according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

The rocket successfully released the ‚ÄúMichibiki‚Äù No.3 satellite about 30 minutes after launch.

The launch was initially scheduled last week but was postponed due to a technical glitch.

Satellite geolocation systems, initially designed for the US military, now power countless civilian applications, from car navigation to internet browsing on mobile phones.

Japan relies on the US-operated Global Positioning System (GPS). Today‚Äôs launch was part of a broader plan to build a domestic version with four satellites focusing on the country and wider region.

The first satellite was put into orbit in 2010 and the second was launched in June.

The fourth is to be launched by March 2018 to start up the service.

The Japan-built system will still need to operate in tandem with GPS.

Though GPS is widely used in Japan, having supplementary satellites is important in a country where mountainous terrain and high buildings may interfere with its signals.

Michibiki, meaning ‚Äúguidance‚Äù in Japanese, will cover the Asia-Oceania region and is intended for civilian use.

Japan plans to boost the number of its satellites in orbit to seven by around 2023.

China to again launch world‚Äôs fastest bullet train from September 21,"China is relaunching the world‚Äôs fastest bullet trains in September 2017, running at 350 kilometers (217 miles) per hour. (AP photo) China is relaunching the world‚Äôs fastest bullet trains in September 2017, running at 350 kilometers (217 miles) per hour. (AP photo)

After cutting back the speed of the Beijing to Shanghai bullet train following a deadly crash, China is set to again make it one of the world‚Äôs fastest. New generation trains will service the route starting next month, making the 1,250-kilometer (777-mile) journey from the capital to Shanghai in just 4 hours, 30 minutes. The latest trains were unveiled in June and have a top speed of 400 kilometers per hour (250 mph), according to the official Xinhua News Agency.

China first ran trains at 350 kilometers per hour in August 2008, but cut speeds back to 250-300 kilometers per hour in 2011 following a two-train collision near the city of Wenzhou that killed 40 people and injured 191.

China has laid more than 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) of high-speed rail, with a target of adding another 10,000 kilometers (6,214 miles) by 2020. China has spent an estimated $360 billion on high-speed rail, building by far the largest network in the world.

"Utkal Express derailment: ‚ÄòBlock ka time nahin hai, gaadiyan bahut hain‚Äô","Workers repairing the rail track after the Puri-Haridwar Utkal Express train derailed in Khatauli near Muzaffarnagar, on Sunday. PTI Photo Workers repairing the rail track after the Puri-Haridwar Utkal Express train derailed in Khatauli near Muzaffarnagar, on Sunday. PTI Photo

‚ÄúSir, (Kalinga Utkal Express) Meerut city se nikal rahi hai.‚Äù

‚ÄúDe dein, Sir, 15 minute ka inko (block)?‚Äù

‚ÄúNahin nahin, block ka time hi nahin hai‚Ä¶ gaadiyan bahut hain.‚Äù

An audio clip of a purported conversation between Khatauli station master Prakash Singh and a section controller for Northern Railway in Delhi ‚Äî which reportedly took place minutes before the Kalinga Utkal Express derailed at Khatauli on Saturday, killing 22 people ‚Äî indicates that the ground staff had asked for rail traffic to be ‚Äúblocked‚Äù for carrying out maintenance work, but the request was denied.

Shailesh Kumar Pathak, Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), also confirmed that the Permanent Way Inspector (PWI), who is responsible for track maintenance, had asked for a 20-minute ‚Äúblock‚Äù ‚Äî a temporary stoppage of all trains ‚Äî to replace a damaged section of the track on Saturday.

Sources said Pathak has obtained the PWI‚Äôs written request submitted to the Khatauli station master.

While Railways officials said they were trying to verify the authenticity of the audio clip, sources said the Khatauli station staff have identified one of the voices as the station master.

In another purported conversation, the two officials can be heard discussing the PWI‚Äôs request for a ‚Äúblock‚Äù .

‚ÄúSir, yeh PWI 20 minute ka block maangte hain (the PWI is asking for a 20-minute block),‚Äù says a man, purportedly station master Prakash Singh.

‚ÄúYe kaunsa block hai (Which block is this)?‚Äù asks another man, purportedly a section controller for Northern Railway in Delhi.

‚ÄúMain line, loop line sab bandh ho jayengi. Main keh raha hoon gaadiyon ka group hai, kaise mil jayega block (Main line, loop line, everything will close. I have said there is a group of trains, how will we get a block),‚Äù says Singh.

The request for a ‚Äúblock‚Äù is again shot down in a subsequent conversation.

‚ÄúSir, (Kalinga Utkal Express) Meerut city se nikal rahi hai (Kalinga Utkal Express is leaving Meerut city),‚Äù says the section controller.

‚ÄúDe dein, Sir, 15 minute ka inko (block) (Should we give a 15-minute block)?‚Äù asks the station master.

‚ÄúNahin Nahin, block ka time hi nahin hai bhai sahib, gaadiyan bahut hain (no, there is no time for a block, there are many trains),‚Äù the controller replies.

The PWI, Pradeep Kumar, who was among the four officials suspended on Monday, could not be contacted.

Khatauli Station Supervisor Rajendra Singh, who said on Sunday that the station staff had no information about any ongoing work on the tracks, refused to speak to the media on Monday.

‚ÄúLives have been lost only because of a human failure. Work was started on the track without permission. If the PWI‚Äôs request for a block is refused, he doesn‚Äôt have the authority to cut the track without informing the station master,‚Äù said Commissioner of Railway Safety Pathak, who visited the spot on Monday.

Confirming that the PWI had asked for a 20-minute block, Pathak said: ‚ÄúThe request was placed at 5.10 pm but it was refused as it was a busy time. It is the job of a PWI to make sure the track can take the train‚Äôs load. If he thought this was not the case and a block was still denied, he should have followed the standard operating procedure. Red flags should have been placed at a distance of 1,200 m and 600 m from the spot and crackers should have been placed on the tracks to alert the driver and stop the train. This was not done.‚Äù

Pointing to the audio clips and the PWI‚Äôs written request, a source close to the CRS said that ‚Äúthe primary responsibility will fall not just on the track maintenance people but also on the operations control staff who denied the request‚Äù.

Sources said the crack in the ‚Äúglued joint‚Äù of the track was meant to be repaired for some time now. The track maintenance team had arranged a generator, rail welding machine and other equipment, and had sent the written request. ‚ÄúIt has been found that as per official log data, signal was failing frequently because of the faulty joint and the PWI was trying to do a ‚Äòforced block‚Äô,‚Äù said the official. ‚ÄúYes, he should have raised the red flag and stopped traffic‚Ä¶ But the people who denied the block are also responsible.‚Äù

The last train that passed Khatauli safely on Saturday was a passenger train which left the station at 4.46 pm.

According to sources, a crack had been noticed in the track at the accident site ‚Äî 300 metres from the railway station ‚Äî on June 12, when a resident of the area flagged down a train by waving a red shirt.

Blasts in Darjeeling hills upset mood for talks,"Officials investigate the blast site after an explosion near a motor-stand in Darjeeling on Saturday. (PTI Photo) Officials investigate the blast site after an explosion near a motor-stand in Darjeeling on Saturday. (PTI Photo)

THE BLASTS in Darjeeling and Kalimpong last week have thrown a spanner in the negotiations that were going on between the Union Home Ministry and the state government for the past week, sources said. After Home Minister Rajnath Singh met leaders of the Gorkhaland statehood movement on August 12, the ministry has been urging the state government to initiate a dialogue with them.

An official said: ‚ÄúInitially, the West Bengal CM was very upset with what appeared to be a bipartite meeting between the leaders of the statehood movement and the Home Minister. But it was clarified that it wasn‚Äôt the case,‚Äù said an official at state secretariat Nabanna.

After the meeting, Gorkhaland Janmukti Morcha (GJM) president Bimal Gurung had expressed hope that the Centre would do ‚Äújustice to Gorkhas at the earliest‚Äù. But, sources said, that the Centre made it clear that it ‚Äúwould not initiate talks‚Äù. ‚ÄúEven when the Gorkhaland agitation was taking place in the 1980s, led by Subhash Ghisingh, dialogue had initially taken place with the state government. The Centre will not initiate talks. It was only after talks between Ghisingh and former Bengal CM Jyoti Basu that the Centre got involved,‚Äù said a source.

There were some demands that the Gorkhaland Movement Coordination Committee (GMCC) ‚Äî the umbrella group of parties in Hills leading the protest ‚Äî had communicated to Singh. These included resuming of Internet facilities and dropping of cases against senior GJM leaders Bimal Gurung and Swaraj Thapa and criminal charges against those ‚Äúarrested during the political movement‚Äù, said sources. But the prime demand, sources added, was that ‚Äúdialogue on Gorkhaland‚Äù begins.

‚ÄúWe are not demanding the formation of a state immediately. But with the formation of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration in 2011, our demand for a separate state has been put on record. We want dialogue to resume,‚Äù a GJM leader said. Singh had communicated the GMCC‚Äôs demands to the Mamata government. Sources said that, at least initially, Mamata had ‚Äúappeared receptive‚Äù. In an interview to The Indian Express on August 11, she had said ‚Äúlet peace be restored, there may be talks, no problem‚Äù.

But since the blast on Saturday, a source close to Mamata said that the government‚Äôs strategy had changed. ‚ÄúTalks are likely to take place. But in terms of the negotiations, Mamata‚Äôs hand has grown stronger. She will not give any ground,‚Äù said a source close to the CM.

‚ÄúWith Durga Puja coming up, a key time for tourism in the Hills, it is becoming harder for the GJM to sustain the protest since tourism is key for the local economy there,‚Äù the source added.

Nigeria says ailing President Muhammadu Buhari to return today after 3 months,"FILE ‚Äì In this May 29, 2015 file photo, Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari salutes his supporters during his inauguration in Abuja, Nigeria. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba, File) FILE ‚Äì In this May 29, 2015 file photo, Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari salutes his supporters during his inauguration in Abuja, Nigeria. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba, File)

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari will return to the country Saturday after more than three months in London for medical treatment, his office announced, while giving no details on what exactly has been ailing him. Buhari will address the nation in a broadcast Monday morning, the statement from the office of the presidency said.

The government of Africa‚Äôs most populous nation has never said what kind of medical treatment the 74-year-old leader has been receiving. He also spent seven weeks in London for treatment earlier this this year and said he had never been so sick in his life. He also spoke of receiving blood transfusions.

Saturday‚Äôs statement merely called it a ‚Äúhealth challenge.‚Äù

Buhari‚Äôs long absences have led some to call for his replacement and for the military to remind its personnel to remain loyal. In recent weeks, his office has been releasing photos of officials meeting with the rail-thin but smiling president in the hope of reassuring people back home.

Nigeria‚Äôs ongoing challenges include the deadly Boko Haram insurgency, a weak economy and one of the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crises, with millions malnourished in the northeast. With Buhari away, Nigeria has been led by acting president and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who met with the president in London in mid-July and announced that Buhari would return to Nigeria ‚Äúvery shortly.‚Äù

Observers have feared that political unrest could erupt in Nigeria, particularly in the predominantly Muslim north, should Buhari not finish his term in office. The previous president was a Christian from the south, as is Osinbajo.

When former President Musa Yar‚ÄôAdua was ill abroad for months before coming home to die in 2009, northerners blocked his southern Vice President Goodluck Jonathan from assuming power, creating a months-long political paralysis.

Jonathan was eventually confirmed, but his subsequent successful run for election angered many Muslims, breaking an unwritten agreement that power rotate between northerners and southerners. Buhari‚Äôs four-year term ends in 2019.

The curious case of Taiwan and Chinese Taipei,"Over 12,000 athletes from over 140 countries are scheduled to compete in the ongoing Universiade. (Source: Reuters) Over 12,000 athletes from over 140 countries are scheduled to compete in the ongoing Universiade. (Source: Reuters)

Taiwan is what they want to be known as, but Chinese Taipei is what they are forced to compete as in the ongoing Summer Universiade or the ‚ÄòLittle Olympics‚Äô ‚Äî the biggest sporting event to be held in the island nation.

Chinese Taipei is not the name most of the people in this country can relate to. The 29th Summer Universiade was a chance to hog the

limelight as a free and democratic nation, but it isn‚Äôt the case as politics and diplomacy have forced it to participate in the event as Chinese Taipei.

The host nation may have the biggest squad out of 142 teams competing in the Summer Universiade but its 368 athletes will not be able to represent the Taiwanese flag or sing its national anthem as has been the case in international sporting events in the past.

The reason being that China sees the country as part of its territory and objects to any official diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.

‚ÄúIn our struggle to fight for international space, we have no choice but to accept the Chinese Taipei name,‚Äù said Su Li-chiung, secretary-general of the Taipei City government, who heads the Universiade preparations.

Since 1984, Taiwan has taken part in the Olympic Games as Chinese Taipei but residents feel it‚Äôs high time their nation gets its due recognition before the world.

‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt be made to feel ashamed of our history and identity. It is one of the rare moments that Taiwan is in the spotlight. We are a free and democratic nation,‚Äù said Steve, a marketing professional, who displayed the Taiwanese flag at the opening ceremony at the Taipei Municipal Stadium here yesterday.

In the last Summer Olympics at Rio, a Taiwanese athlete who won a gold medal in taekwando, watched a flag rise and listened to an anthem that most citizens would not normally recognise as Taiwanese.

Under the rules of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), competing under the name Chinese Taipei is the only way that Taiwan can participate in the Olympics. And the same rule applies for Taiwan in the ongoing Universiade, which is organised by the International University Sports Federation (FISU), which is governed by the IOC guidelines.

Over 12,000 athletes from over 140 countries are scheduled to compete in the ongoing Universiade and for Taiwan, it was a perfect platform to put forward its case before the international community.

But as has been the case, China has denied the island nation the global limelight. Such has been Beijing‚Äôs tough stance that its athletes took part only in individual events and boycotted the opening ceremony.

The two nations got separated after a civil war in 1949, but Beijing still considers the self-ruled island as part of its territory and objects to any official diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.

International University Sports Federation (FISU) president Oleg Matytsin steered clear of the controversy and said that the term Chinese Taipei has been used for Games because the federation must conform to the IOC Olympic Movement rules.

‚ÄúThe FISU is an IOC-recognised organization, so it has to conform to the Olympic Movement rules and regulations,‚Äù Matytsin said. ‚ÄúRespect the rules. Today, I believe it‚Äôs very important to educate people how to play according to the rules.‚Äù

The official Universiade media guide had used Chinese Taipei, but it was later changed to Taiwan after legislators and the public expressed discontent. Interestingly, at the opening ceremony, Tsai Ing-wen was introduced as the President of ‚Äúthe Republic of China‚Äù,

Taiwan‚Äôs official name, which China does not recognise.

She waved to the audience and declared the Games open but refrained from giving any speech.

DIAL to expand Delhi airport capacity,"Currently, T1 ‚Äì which is used for domestic operations of some flights ‚Äì can handle 20 million passengers annually. A fourth runway would be constructed by 2021. File photo Currently, T1 ‚Äì which is used for domestic operations of some flights ‚Äì can handle 20 million passengers annually. A fourth runway would be constructed by 2021. File photo

Delhi airport operator DIAL on Tuesday said it will expand the passenger handling capacity of two operational terminals, recommission operations at terminal two and build a new runway by 2021. DIAL has also asked airlines operating from T1 to partially shift their operations to T2 from October. ‚ÄúWe have planned to increase the capacity of T1 and T3 and build a fourth runway in due course of time,‚Äù Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) CEO I Prabhakara Rao said.

As per the master plan, capacity of T1 will be increased from 20 million to 40 million and the capacity of T3 will be increased from 34 million to 45 million, he said in a statement. Departure terminal T1D would be merged with arriving terminal T1C and then expanded to accommodate 40 million passengers per annum.

Currently, T1 ‚Äì which is used for domestic operations of some flights ‚Äì can handle 20 million passengers annually. A fourth runway would be constructed by 2021. ‚ÄúThis will ease out future pressure on other runways and will be constructed parallel to runway 11/29,‚Äù DIAL said.

At present, there are three runways. Taking into consideration rising passenger numbers, Rao said, ‚Äúwe have asked the airlines operating from T1 for part shifting of operations to T2 from October‚Äù. There is an immediate need to decongest T1 and one-thirds of operations need to be shifted to T2, which has been rev amped with an investment of around Rs 100 crore, Rao said.

Operations at T2 were stopped in 2010. T3 and T2 would cater to the growing traffic in the next three to four years by which time T1 expansion project would be completed, he added.

There would be a ‚Äúhuge transformation‚Äù for T1, Rao said, adding that there would be metro rail connectivity to the terminal. The expansion activities are part of the master plan, which would be implemented in three phases starting from 2018 -2021 period. The work in the second and the third phases would be done during 2021-2025 and 2026 onwards, respectively.

In 2016-17, the airport handled 57.7 million passengers and more than 8.57 lakh tonnes of cargo. DIAL is a consortium led by the GMR group. Other stakeholders are government-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Germany‚Äôs Fraport.

"Interview: ‚ÄòThere was convergence between AIADMK, BJP, now more scope‚Äô","BJP general secretary P Muralidhar Rao BJP general secretary P Muralidhar Rao

BJP general secretary P Muralidhar Rao talks to Indian Express about united AIADMK‚Äôs prospects in Tamil Nadu and what it means for BJP

How do you look at the developments in Tamil Nadu?

As far as Tamil Nadu and its people are concerned, to a large extent, the uncertainty has been cleared after the merger of two factions of AIADMK‚Ä¶ It means there will be some kind of stability.

How good is it for BJP?

BJP is focused on increasing its strength and doesn‚Äôt depend on someone else to grow. Definitely there has been convergence between the AIADMK and BJP in the last few years over issues of state and national interests. Now there is more scope to build upon these.

So is the united AIADMK going to be part of NDA government?

It depends on the AIADMK and the PM. I cannot say now. But there is scope for convergence with the party because there has been cooperation with it in Parliament and on other issues.

There were some differences in AIADMK. Dinakaran also seems to have the backing of some MLAs. Do you see chances of revolt in the AIADMK?

No one has come out against the leadership‚Äôs decision to merge. Nor was there any attempt to precipitate a revolt. Dinakaran held a rally to prove a political point, but it doesn‚Äôt look like he would stretch it further.

You don‚Äôt see any threat to the stability of the government in Tamil Nadu? Retaining power in the state depends on their unity. Their survival is also linked to it. After MGR‚Äôs death, when J Jayalalithaa took over, arch rival DMK could not take the place of AIADMK.

But will developments post Jayalalithaa‚Äôs death affect AIADMK‚Äôs prospects?

As a BJP leader I can say this much ‚Äî AIADMK as a party requires approval from its cadre and its government needs support from the people. It depends on its governance record. A vacuum has been created after Jayalalithaa‚Äôs death and M Karunanidhi‚Äôs withdrawal from the limelight. Many will make strong efforts to fill that.

What‚Äôs BJP‚Äôs future in Tamil Nadu?

BJP is focused on its growth ‚Äîbringing a new cadre and positioning itself as a party that can deliver and safeguard Tamil Nadu‚Äôs interests will be our target. There have been some developments and it depends on how BJP utilises the situation.

Centre protests J-K Bar‚Äôs stand on state‚Äôs accession to India,"Supreme Court (File) Supreme Court (File)

The BJP-led NDA government on Monday protested the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association (Srinagar)‚Äôs stand before the Supreme Court ‚Äúquestioning the accession of the state to India‚Äù. ‚ÄúThey are questioning the very accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India‚Ä¶. They have described it as mysterious‚Ä¶. They say all the elections in the state were rigged. This is the stand taken by members of the bar,‚Äù Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar told a bench of Chief Justice of India J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud during the hearing of an appeal filed by the association, demanding a ban on pellet guns in quelling protests in the Valley.

The High Court had rejected the bar body‚Äôs plea seeking a ban on use of pellet guns on the ground that the Centre had already set up a committee of experts through its memorandum of July 26, 2016, for exploring alternatives to pellet guns. Kumar was responding to the association‚Äôs charge that the Centre had not yet talked to all the groups concerned in the state.

The solicitor-general pointed out that during the last date of hearing, the court had asked the association to come up with suggestions on how to bring peace back to the state. This was also echoed by the CJI, who asked the petitioner‚Äôs counsel: ‚ÄúHave you used your good offices? We told you to use your good offices (to restore peace).‚Äù The court also noted: ‚ÄúWe have not heard of stone-pelting for a long time.‚Äù The SC has now set October 4 to finally hear both sides and decide the matter.

Lin Dan got his quest underway for a record sixth world badminton championship with a routine win over local British hope Kieran Merrilees on Monday. Lin won 21-15, 21-10 after an 11-1 start.

‚ÄúNormally the first match is not easy, because I need to get myself in a good mindset,‚Äù Lin said. ‚ÄúI did a lot of practice and preparation, so I need to make this mindset last until the end of the championships.‚Äù

Next for the seventh-seeded Lin is Emil Holst of Denmark, who beat the Chinese superstar in March at the German Open. The other names in the top half of the draw were also relatively untroubled; top-seeded Son Wan Ho, and Kidambi Srikanth of India.

Son could become the first South Korean male to win the world championship, but he has to pass the quarterfinals for the first time. He and Kidambi, who beat Son while winning consecutive Superseries titles in Indonesia and Australia in June, are seeded to meet in the quarters.

The bottom half of the men‚Äôs draw begins on Tuesday and features all three medallists from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics: Gold medallist and defending two-time worlds champion Chen Long, silver medallist Lee Chong Wei, and bronze medallist Viktor Axelsen.

Chen, the Asian championship winner, starts against Georges Julien Paul of Mauritius. Chen‚Äôs on course to meet Chong Wei in the quarterfinals. The winner then could play Axelsen.

Chong Wei, three times a worlds runner-up, begins against Brice Leverdez of France, against whom he has a 7-1 record. All 16 women‚Äôs seeds received byes into the second round, including Olympic and two-time defending champion Carolina Marin of Spain, and top-seeded Akane Yamaguchi.

"Bihar‚Äôs Srijan Scandal part IV: Funds diverted, drug-less health centre told patients, ‚ÄòMake do‚Äô","At the primary health centre in Sabour block. Express Photo by Santosh Singh At the primary health centre in Sabour block. Express Photo by Santosh Singh

In the absence of government funds that remained parked illegally with the Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti, a primary health care centre in Sabour block has remained without antibiotics, an ultrasound machine and a woman doctor for years; over 150 farmers displaced due to the Pirpaiti power plant continue to wait for compensation; and over a dozen city bylanes and drains await repair and construction. Officials suspect that given the scale of the Rs 700-crore scam, many other such district schemes may well be stuck.

An investigation by The Indian Express shows that Rs 275 crore was siphoned off from the Land Acquisition Department, while the Mukhyamantri Nagar Vikas Yojana and Health Department deposited Rs 10.26 crore and Rs 10.75 crore with Srijan respectively. As a registered society, Srijan was not authorised to function as a bank or accept such high-value deposits.

The scam was exposed when a Rs 270-crore Land Acquisition Department cheque presented at Bank of Baroda bounced on August 4. Bhagalpur District Magistrate Aadesh Titarmare conducted an internal inquiry and found that the government account didn‚Äôt have funds, following which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar sent an Economic Offences Unit team to Bhagalpur.

Nine FIRs have been filed in the case so far, and the number of arrests is up to 18. One of them died on Monday reportedly due to an illness. The Bhagalpur police on Sunday evening also raided premises of five associates of Srijan founder secretary Manorama Devi.

A look at the victims of the scam:

HEALTH

The PHC at Sabour block town is located barely 500 metres from the Srijan office. A small line stands before Dr Ajay Kumar Singh at the out-patient department. As he examines the patients, Dr Singh says he can prescribe from only among 10-odd medicines to his patients, mainly paracetamol, vitamin tablets, cough syrup, ointments, eye or ear drops. Though the PHC has antibiotics for children, these are not available for adults, and he asks several to buy them from the open market. The PHC gets about 100 patients daily (except Sunday).

There is a functioning lab for routine tests, but no ultrasound machine. While the six beds at the PHC are essentially for delivery cases, the centre has no woman doctor. Says a patient, Bachchu Das, ‚ÄúWe complain, but the PHC always cites funds crunch. ‚ÄòBas kaam chalao (make do with what is there)‚Äô, is a common answer.‚Äù

Another patient, Rajesh Mandal, who has heard about the Srijan scam, says, ‚ÄúWe always suspected the outfit. But why blame Srijan when government officials connived with it? When protectors turn looters, what can be done?‚ÄùDr Singh directed queries regarding ‚Äúconstraints‚Äù to PHC in-charge

Dr Singh directed queries regarding ‚Äúconstraints‚Äù to PHC in-charge Dr Rajkumar Choudhary, who was on leave.

LAND ACQUISITION

Between 2008 and 2011, the state government acquired 988 acres for setting up the Pirpaiti power plant. Originally planned as a thermal plant, it will now be a 1,338-acre solar power unit. Among the 969 local farmers who gave their land for the project, 150 are yet to get compensation, ranging from amounts Rs 30 lakh to Rs 1 crore.

The last promise was for payment in August-September this year. However, then came the news that the Land Acquisition Department‚Äôs Rs 270 crore cheque had bounced. Mohammed Farooq, who is to get his Rs 30 lakh, says, ‚ÄúWe stalled construction at the plant.‚Äù

Munna Singh, who is due Rs 70 lakh for his land, says the department had been delaying payment on some excuse or the other. ‚ÄúThey claimed there was no money. Now, after the Srijan scam expose, we know why. We need the money and will not allow construction at the power plant site till all farmers get compensation,‚Äù says Singh.

Sheikh Azmat, who is to receive Rs 50 lakh, says the delay in compensation money has affected their plans for their fields as well as education of their children.

MUKHYAMANTRI NAGAR VIKAS YOJANA

The state‚Äôs pet town planning scheme promises road and drains repair and construction, besides construction of pavements and development of parks. Bhagalpur has 51 wards, and work on their roads and drains largely depends on the availability and sanction of funds under the flagship scheme.

An open drain running along the boundary wall of Bhagalpur Central Cooperative Bank is an example of what the scheme has actually come to. The bank incidentally is also being investigated for transferring Rs 48 crore to Srijan.

Says resident Rajiv Kumar, ‚ÄúWhen a government department cannot get sanction for construction of a drain in front of its building, how can common people get a road or nullah repair sanctioned?‚Äù

While Bhagalpur DM Aadesh Titarmare could not be contacted, a municipal corporation official admitted, ‚ÄúNon-construction of some roads may not be directly linked to siphoning of funds, but it did affect town planning.‚Äù

A Collectorate official cited the Srijan scam to say why they couldn‚Äôt be of more help. They were busy providing documents to police, he claimed. ‚ÄúEven routine meetings are not being held. We can take questions after the Srijan dust settles a bit,‚Äù said a senior Bhagalpur officer.

Accused dead, RJD says ‚Äòanother Vyapam‚Äô

Welfare Department clerk-grade official Mahesh Mandal, who had been arrested in connection with the Srijan scam, died of kidney failure at Bhagalpur‚Äôs Mayaganj hospital on Monday. He had been put on dialysis soon after his arrest last week.

Mandal, 57, who needed dialysis every three-four days, would go for treatment to Mumbai, with the family spending Rs 1 lakh per month on flights from Patna. His son Shiv Mandal is a JD(U) leader.

After his death, Mandal‚Äôs relatives protested against the hospital administration, accusing them of not taking proper care of him. His brother Dinesh Mandal said: ‚ÄúWe suspect foul play as my brother could have exposed several politicians involved in the scam.‚Äù

Denying the charges, Bhagalpur SSP Manoj Kumar said: ‚ÄúWe admitted Mandal to hospital soon after his arrest.‚Äù A Mayaganj hospital official said postmortem had revealed water in Mandal‚Äôs lungs, reported in case of renal complications.

The opposition RJD, that stalled the Assembly‚Äôs opening day proceedings over the Srijan scam and floods, said there couldn‚Äôt be a fair probe under the present government. Former CM Rabri Devi said, ‚ÄúCM Nitish Kumar and Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi should resign.‚Äù

Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said, ‚ÄúThe first death in the Srijan scam has been reported. Srijan is getting bigger than Vyapam scam.‚Äù

"Iran parliament clears oil, foreign ministers for Rouhani‚Äôs new cabinet","Iran‚Äôs President Hassan Rouhani (Source: AP) Iran‚Äôs President Hassan Rouhani (Source: AP)

The Iranian parliament voted on Sunday to keep the oil and foreign ministers, two of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani‚Äôs key members of cabinet, in their posts. Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh has been credited with the boost in Iran‚Äôs crude output since many global sanctions were lifted last year and with a multi-billion-dollar deal with France‚Äôs Total to develop South Pars, the world‚Äôs largest gas field.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was Iran‚Äôs lead negotiator in the landmark 2015 agreement in which Western powers agreed to rescind sanctions on the Islamic Republic in exchange for curbs on its disputed nuclear programme. ‚ÄúThe most important duty of our foreign minister is to stand by the nuclear agreement and not allow America to succeed, not allow Iran‚Äôs enemies to succeed,‚Äù Rouhani said in an address to parliament before the vote, broadcast live on state TV.

‚ÄúThe person who defends the nuclear agreement is standing against the enemies of Iran, in other words standing against America, Israel and some small enemies in the region who are creating trouble.‚Äù Fourteen other ministerial candidates also received parliamentary approval on Sunday and only one of Rouhani‚Äôs nominees, the candidate for the ministry of energy, did not gather enough votes.

Rouhani was criticised by reformists two weeks ago when he submitted the all-male list of cabinet ministers to parliament. He had mentioned the importance of women‚Äôs rights in campaign speeches before May‚Äôs presidential election in which he won a second term. Rouhani appointed two female vice-presidents one day after submitting the list of candidates but the appointments did not defuse the criticism.

Vice-presidents do not have ministerial responsibility and do not need parliamentary approval. The approval of most of the ministerial candidates was a boost for Rouhani but he still faces hardline conservative opposition to his outreach to the West through the nuclear deal and his push for an easing of social restrictions at home.

In his address, Rouhani ‚Äì who lacks control over security and judicial organs that answer only to hardline Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ‚Äì acknowledged the obstacles his administration faces in his second term. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a smooth and easy road ahead. In the current situation, governance in the world, including Europe, America, Asia and other continents, is not easy and smooth, much less in Iran and in this chaotic (Middle East) region which has left us with many problems.‚Äù

"Mohali worst hit, showpiece airport road goes under water","The flooded airport road in Mohali on Monday (Express Photo by Jasbir Malhi) The flooded airport road in Mohali on Monday (Express Photo by Jasbir Malhi)

THE DRAINAGE system in Punjab-administered Mohali collapsed under the onslaught of downpour that lashed Tricity on Monday morning. All roads, including the showpiece six-lane airport road, were flooded throwing life out of gear for at least six hours on the first day of the week. Residential areas and parks turned into lakes. In some places, there was two and a half feet of water. Many residents watched helplessly as water entered their homes in almost all phases of Mohali, which was the worst hit in the Tricity.

Traffic came to a standstill on all major roads in the city. Uprooted trees and irregular power supply added to the woes of the residents, who blamed the Municipal Corporation for not taking enough precautions before the rainy season. According to the traffic police, around 500 vehicles developed snags after water entered their engines. Several cars, especially low-slung luxury cars, had stalled on the airport road. One car was floating near the Radha Swami light point.

Occupants of many vehicles had abandoned them on the roads in different areas of the city, adding to the jam. The traffic police struggled to arrange recovery vans and failed to clear the roads where people left their vehicles. Some people called the mechanics but they proved too few for the scale of the crisis that was unfolding on the roads.

The roads leading towards District Administrative Complex and the District Courts Complex witnessed huge traffic tailbacks in the morning. Order could be restored in the city only around 2 pm, when the water finally drained. Water entered many houses in Phase 1, Phase 3B2, Phase 5, Phase 4, Phase 2, Mohali village, Kumbra village, Phase 8, Phase 9, Phase 11 and sectors 68, 69, 70 and 71. The low-lying areas in Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 4 were among the worst hit areas as the water logged in the parks and roads due to poor drainage system. Two trees were uprooted near Forest Complex in Sector 68, blocking the traffic. Hoping to clear the vehicles, the police made several diversions but it still did not help.

The commuters started internal routes which further worsened the situation. In the midst of all this, a visit by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh to a private hospital in the city to meet his relative added to the difficulty, as police personnel had to be deputed for his security for traffic regulation on the route. It was not clear if he noticed the chaos on the roads. Ward number 17 councillor Kuljeet Singh Bedi said that he had to call the fire brigade to pump out water from some areas where it entered the houses in Phase 3B2. He added that he was witnessing such scenes for the first time after the floods of 1990.

Ward number 10 councillor Kuldeep Kaur Kang blamed the MC officials for not answering their phones even as water was entering many houses in Phase 5 which was among the worst hit areas on Monday. Ward number 9 councillor Arun Sharma said that there was around three feet water which entered the parks in his ward. He added that he had to call the fire brigade for sucking out the water from the internal roads.

Ashok Jha, ward number 8 councillor, said that parks were flooded in his area. He added that although the drainage system was repaired last month, the high volume of water made it impossible for the drainage pipes to discharge the water quickly enough. ‚ÄúI called Municipal Commissioner Rajesh Dhiman many times, but he did not take my calls. The other officers also ignored calls. The MC staff reached Phase 5 when the water had already entered the houses,‚Äù she alleged.

The residents of the area also held a protest against the MC and alleged that no official came to listen to their problems. Satnam Singh, a Phase 5 resident, said that the rain started around 7.30 am and when he came out of his house around 8.30 am to take his car for dropping his son to school, he saw that his car was submerged in water. ‚ÄúMost of the residents in my locality used to park the car in a nearby park. When I saw the water, I could not enter the park. My car‚Äôs upper part was visible,‚Äù Satnam added.

Guri Sharma, a teacher at a private school in Sector 69, said that she had to leave her car on the road near PCL light point as it developed a technical snag after water entered its engine. Vineet Kumar, a Mataur resident, said that he had never seen such waterlogging in their area in the last 10 years. He added that water was flowing around 4 feet above the roads and it stopped the traffic flow.

‚ÄúMataur is a low-lying area and water flows through the area due to which water flooded the entire sector and entered many houses,‚Äù he said. Shikha Sharma, a Phase 2 resident, said that she fell from her Activa scooter and suffered injuries as she entered the water on the main road. Shikha could not control her two-wheeler.

An ambulance of Sirhind-based private hospital was stuck in the traffic on the airport road near Radha Swami lightpoint. A PCR team helped the ambulance get out of the traffic jam. Mayor Kulwant Singh and Municipal Commissioner Rajesh Dhiman visited many areas which were flooded due to rain. Speaking to Chandigarh Newsline, the commissioner said that the drainage system did not fail but the water accumulated due to heavy rain. He added that the water cleared within two hours after the rain which means that the drainage system was working properly.

Senior Superintendent of Police Kuldeep Singh Chahal said that the rain came during the peak hours when the children go to schools and people go to their offices and due to rainwater, some vehicles stuck in the rain due to which other people had to face the problem due to traffic jams.

"2015 Kotkapura Lathicharge: United Akali Dal releases video clip, says peaceful protesters lathicharged","Several persons were injured in this lathicharge and angry protesters had later torched police vehicles. (Representational Image) Several persons were injured in this lathicharge and angry protesters had later torched police vehicles. (Representational Image)

Two years after a police lathicharge in Faridkot‚Äôs Kotkapura Chowk during a protest against an incident of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib, representatives of United Akali Dal put out a video clip purportedly showing that police cracked down on protesters who were sitting peacefully.

Gurdeep Singh Bathinda, general secretary of state United Akal Dal said,‚ÄùIt has been widely claimed that public indulged in stone pelting and even manhandled cops, following which lathicharge was done. However, our video clearly shows that police started lathicharge, followed by water cannons and teargas shells on peaceful public who were doing kirtan.‚Äù

Several persons were injured in this lathicharge and angry protesters had later torched police vehicles.

Bathinda said,‚ÄùIn our video, a senior cop is seen talking over phone constantly and it seems either he is telling details about the operation to someone or was seeking instructions from someone. We will submit this video clip to Justice Ranjeet Commission and even to the CM Punjab and will ask them to probe as to whom this cop was talking to. This will help establish as to who gave orders for a lathicharge. We also want the cops to be punished for this act as two persons had also been killed in Behbal Kalan police firing.‚Äù The commission formed by Congress government has started its fresh probe and does not have a deadline to complete it.

"‚ÄòIran‚Äôs top priority to protect nuclear deal from United States‚Äô, says President Hassan Rouhani","‚ÄúStanding up for the JCPOA means standing up to Iran‚Äôs enemies,‚Äù he said on the last day of debates over his cabinet selections. Rouhani indicated a week ago that Iran was ready to walk out on the nuclear deal if the United States continued to apply fresh sanctions.

Iran‚Äôs President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday, the top foreign policy priority for his new government was to protect the nuclear deal from being torn up by the United States. ‚ÄúThe most important job of our foreign minister is first to stand behind the JCPOA, and not to allow the US and other enemies to succeed,‚Äù Rouhani told parliament, using the technical name for the 2015 deal that eased sanctions in exchange for curbs to Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme.

‚ÄúStanding up for the JCPOA means standing up to Iran‚Äôs enemies,‚Äù he said on the last day of debates over his cabinet selections. Rouhani indicated a week ago that Iran was ready to walk out on the nuclear deal if the United States continued to apply fresh sanctions.

It has come under mounting pressure after Tehran carried out missile tests and Washington imposed new sanctions ‚Äî with each accusing the other of violating the spirit of the agreement. But Rouhani has insisted the deal remains the preferred way forward, not least to help rebuild Iran‚Äôs struggling economy and create jobs.

‚ÄúThe second responsibility of the foreign ministry‚Ä¶ is to get involved in economic activities. It should help attract foreign investment and technology,‚Äù Rouhani said. He was addressing lawmakers ahead of votes of confidence on his ministerial choices.

Rouhani, a political moderate, began his second term earlier this month after winning a resounding victory over a hardline challenger in May. He has vowed to continue his outreach to the world, and to improve civil liberties at home, but has been criticised by reformists for again failing to select a single female minister.

"Pro Kabaddi 2017: Puneri Paltan down Patna Pirates, Jaipur Pink Panthers snatch narrow win against UP Yoddha","Puneri Paltan beat Patna Pirates for the first time in the history of Pro Kabaddi. Puneri Paltan beat Patna Pirates for the first time in the history of Pro Kabaddi.

Sandeep Narwal single-handedly kept his team ahead of Patna Pirates. The raider made some of the most crucial raids and caused an all-out as well to keep his team Puneri Paltan on top in a high-scoring match in the Pro Kabaddi 2017 in Lucknow.

The other Narwal ‚Äî Pradeep ‚Äî part of the Patna unit tried his best to help his team by 19 off the total 42 points but the defence did not help him. He led Patna‚Äôs comeback in the second half but it was not enough has Paltan held on to a 47-42 win.

Pune coach BC Ramesh said that having Narwal on the mat is very important. ‚ÄúWhile Sandeep was on the mat, he didn‚Äôt let Patna‚Äôs Pardeep score points. Having a player like him in the right corner gives us an edge over other teams to take down Pardeep,‚Äù he said.

Pune had a plan to stop Patna‚Äôs ‚Äòraiding machine‚Äô and to a point, they did manage to keep Pardeep quiet. It was the first time that Pardeep was taken down thrice in his first five raids. While Pardeep was kept out of action for over eight minutes in the first half, Pune took a lead of 12 points. Pirates trailed 13-25 at halftime.

However, the ‚ÄòDupki King‚Äô made a strong comeback and went onto score 19 points from 24 raids and tried to get Patna back into the game. His super raid reduced the lead to 41-37, it was the successful tackle by Sandeep in the right corner to take down Pirates raider Monu Goyat in the second last moment which pulled the things back in Pune‚Äôs favour.

As per Patna Pirates coach Ram Meher Singh, it was their defence which let the game slip from their hands despite Pardeep‚Äôs heroics. ‚ÄúWhen Pardeep fails it does put pressure on the team but going all blank like this is seriously not acceptable. When you could easily get rid of the player with a bonus point then what is the need to give three points.‚Äù

In the second game of the night, Jaipur Pink Panthers, in the absence of Manjeet Chhillar, coasted to a 24-22 win as over UP Yoddha, who succumbed to their third straight loss in Lucknow. Jasvir Singh led the Jaipur unit to the narrow win.

On the backfoot after losing two matches in last five minutes, the Yoddhas focused on strengthening their defence which resulted in exerting pressure on their raiders.

It was the first time that Jaipur Pink Panthers and UP Yoddha faced off in Pro Kabaddi and gave Season 5 it‚Äôs one of the most thrilling encounters. Just like their previous two games, UP let the game slip from their hands in the dying moments. But it won‚Äôt be wrong to say that more than their defence, it was Jasvir‚Äôs experience that helped Jaipur to make a comeback as they were trailing 15-19.

With only two UP defenders left on the court and players like Nitin Tomar, Rishank Devadiga taken off, Pink Panthers capitalised the opportunity. With two minutes remaining for the final whistle, Jasvir gave Pink Panthers a crucial one point lead to take his team‚Äôs score to 20-19. Soon UP leveled it with Hadi Tajik getting one point for the hosts.

But, the drama continued till the final moment as both teams gave it all before the season 1 winners forced an all out to take the match in their favour. One could make out from Jasvir and Abhishek Bachchan‚Äôs celebration that how much did this win mean to them.

When asked how important it was for the youngsters to prove their mettle in Manjeet‚Äôs absence, Jaipur coach said, ‚ÄúFirst, there is no comparison for Manjeet Chhillar. His absence puts a lot of pressure on the team. Earlier, we lost Selvamani and now Manjeet. But with full support from the youngsters and the owner (Abhishek) we played our best. Give your best before going down.‚Äù

Balwan Singh also confirmed that Selvamani will be joining the team from September. ‚ÄúSelvamani is currently in his home town (Chennai) going through rehab. We can expect him to join us from next month.‚Äù While Selvamani mostly likely to join from September, Manjeet‚Äôs fitness now haunts Jaipur‚Äôs campaign.

12-year-old is first dengue victim this year in Delhi,"Representational Image Representational Image

A 12-year-old boy has succumbed to dengue ‚Äî the first death due to the vector-borne disease reported in the city this season ‚Äî official data released by the MCD revealed on Monday. The boy, who was admitted to a Delhi hospital on July 30, died on August 1, officials confirmed. Officials at Sir Gangaram Hospital said the boy, who hailed from Bihar and resided in south Delhi‚Äôs Humayunpur area, was admitted to the intensive care unit (paediatric division) at the hospital after he tested positive for dengue. ‚ÄúHe succumbed due to Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF),‚Äù a hospital official said.

Dengue has four serotypes. Type 2 ‚Äî which causes thrombocytopenia or drop in platelets, haemorrhagic fever, organ failure and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) ‚Äî is considered the most common cause of DHF. The latest data also revealed that at least 734 cases of mosquito-borne infections have been reported in the capital in the week ending August 19. An alarming 47 per cent of the total dengue cases reported in the city this year were during the first 19 days of August.

This week, Delhi reported 73 cases of dengue, of which the maximum number of cases (16) were reported from areas under the SDMC. An additional 87 cases were reported in Delhi where the patient acquired the infection from outside the state. According to the data, 50 cases of malaria have been reported this month, including 11 this week. The data also revealed that 194 cases of chikungunya have been reported in the city this year. Twenty fresh cases of the infection were reported this week alone.

Tales From the Coal Crypt,"Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973.

Let me start with the positives. Subhomoy Bhattacharjee‚Äôs book on India‚Äôs coal story has all the facts that a person might want to know about this industry. And I truly mean it ‚Äî from July 1836 when, through Carr, Tagore and Company, Dwarkanath Tagore (Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs grandfather), bought out a Raniganj mine in the district of Burdwan some 130 miles northwest of Kolkata, the nationwide scandal on coal block allocations triggered by the Comptroller and Auditor General‚Äôs report of August 2012 to Naveen Jindal‚Äôs foray into tapping the coal deposits of Mozambique. It is replete with information, hard facts, interviews and extremely plausible conjectures which makes the book an essential reference kit for anyone interested in this complex and messy industry.

Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. This was a cornerstone of Indira Gandhi‚Äôs nationalisation-driven socialist rule after the Bangladesh war and the bill was enthusiastically piloted by Mohan Kumaramangalam, a sophisticated and erudite trade union leader, an ex-Communist Party of India cadre and her minister for coal and mines. Describing the private sector mines as relics of the Middle Ages and instruments of human oppression, Kumaramangalam argued that if nationalisation was postponed by another 25 years, there would be little or no coal left for the country, barring uneconomical, hazardous units, underground fires and poorly paid workers. Coal nationalisation was Mohan Kumaramangalam‚Äôs last hurrah. Very soon afterwards, he was one of the 48 who died in a terrible Indian Airlines crash on 31 May 1973.

The next chapter, ‚ÄòCoal on Sale‚Äô, looks at the large scale illegal theft in the mining and sale of coal in the decade or so that followed nationalisation ‚Äî the stuff that made multi-millionaires of thugs led by the infamous four-term MLA Surya Deo Singh who became the legend and godfather of Dhanbad, as well as others such as Babloo Srivastava, Brijesh Singh, Hari Shankar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi. A part of every transaction in the nationalised mines from recruitment to sales and transport had to be paid to these goons; nothing could work without their say-so and their cuts. Bhattacharjee then uses the theme of ‚Äòcoal on sale‚Äô to transit from small to very large sales via Manoj Jayaswal, a hitherto unknown cricket-loving businessman from Nagpur and his application for a large coal block in Chhattisgarh; to be followed by Naveen Jindal and Sandeep Jajodia of Monnet Ispat.

That sets the stage for Bhattacharjee‚Äôs next chapter entitled, self-evidently, as ‚ÄòNotes from an Auditor‚Äô. It covers the famous CAG report under Vinod Rai‚Äôs tenure and goes into the entire coal mine leasing scam in great detail ‚Äî including the irreparable political damage it caused prime minister Manmohan Singh, the intervention of the Supreme Court which nullified almost all hitherto held coal block auctions, and the travails of the coal secretary PC Parakh and his successor Harish Chandra Gupta. To my mind, it is the best chapter of the book.

After that, the book meanders over the next four chapters. To be sure, it looks into some key issues such as environmental brakes and the part that Jairam Ramesh played as the minister for environment and forests; the role of entrepreneurs; the cost of the failure of coal block auctions to the banking system, especially those that had large exposures in coal based power plants and associated mining rights; a foray into international acquisitions, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa; and on India‚Äôs energy ambitions. Each chapter has considerable information. However, these somehow do not hold together as part of a continuous book.

Which brings me to my basic criticism. Here is a book that has enough material to have become a classic on the subject. Yet, it begs a coherence of purpose and narrative that such a book demands. It is as if there are many informative journalistic copies, each structured in 600-word formats, but few flowing from one to the other, to create tightly knit chapters leading to an ‚Äòun-put-down-able‚Äô book. Unlike, for instance, the books of fellow journalists such as Andrew Ross Sorkin‚Äôs Too Big to Fail, William D. Cohen‚Äôs Money and Power, any of David Halberstam‚Äôs works and, nearer home, some of Arun Shourie‚Äôs books or TN Ninan‚Äôs Turn of the Tortoise, Bhattacharjee does not tie together the many fascinating micro-pieces into the structure of a consistently well reading book. Perhaps it reflects the absence of the publishing editor, who ought to have helped in this task. Also, there are some serious editorial shortfalls, the most obvious one being that, despite having a 14-page bibliography printed in a tiny font-size, there is not a single footnote or endnote in the text to correlate these with the references.

There are so many informative nuggets in this work which, if fused well, ought to have made for a great book. It is, no doubt, a sound reference guide. But it could have been so much more. And that‚Äôs the pity.

Bail a ‚Äòpoint of reference‚Äô for kin of other accused,"Malegaon blast accused Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit. Malegaon blast accused Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit.

ON A day Lt Col Shrikant Purohit got bail in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case, family members of his co-accused, who are still in jail, hoped that their kin would also get bail on ‚Äúgrounds of parity‚Äù. Maharashtra ATS, then led by Hemant Karkare, who died in the November 2008 Mumbai terror attack, got the breakthrough by tracing the owner of the motorcycle on which the explosives were planted in Malegaon. It led to arrest of Pragya Singh Thakur, a former ABVP activist.

Purohit was arrested on November 5, 2008. After him, others arrested are Major Ramesh Upadhyay (retd), Sameer Kulkarni, Rakesh Dhawade, Sudhakar Dwivedi (alias Dayanand Pandey), Sudhakar Chaturvedi, Pravin Takalki, Shivnarayan Kalsangra, Shyam Sahu, Ajay (alias Raja) Rahirkar, and Jagdish Mhatre.

Accused Ramchandra Kalsangra and Sandeep Dange are still absconding. Pragya Thakur, Kalsangra, Sahu, Takalki, Rahirkar and Mhatre were released on bail earlier. Those still in jail are Sameer Kulkarni, a former VHP member; Pune-based arms expert and researcher Rakesh Dhawade; retired Army officer Upadhyay; self-proclaimed seer Sudhakar Dwivedi; and Sudhakar Chaturvedi.

On Monday, Nita Dhawade, sister of Rakesh, said, ‚ÄúWe hope Rakesh now gets bail from the court on grounds of parity.‚Äù Advocate Sanjiv Punalekar said, ‚ÄúOn receiving a copy of Lt Col Purohit‚Äôs bail order, we will move an application seeking bail for Dhawade and Kulkarni.‚Äù

Calling it a ‚Äúmuch-awaited relief‚Äù, Vishal Upadhyay, son of Major Upadhyay (retd), said, ‚ÄúMy father‚Äôs bail application is pending before division bench of Bombay HC. Bail for Lt Col Purohit is a big step in our fight for justice, and can be a point of reference in our argument for bail in HC.‚Äù

On Monday afternoon, Purohit‚Äôs friends, including local BJP corporator Jayant Bhave, gathered at his residence near Pune‚Äôs Law College Road, rejoicing the bail order. Purohit‚Äôs sister Vasanti also arrived there but did not speak with the media. Purohit, those close to him said, had studied at Abhinav Vidyalay, a Marathi-medium school in Pune, and graduated from the city‚Äôs Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce.

"Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli power India to nine-wicket win over Sri Lanka in 1st ODI","Shikhar Dhawan celebrates after scoring his 11th ODI hundred. (Source: Reuters) Shikhar Dhawan celebrates after scoring his 11th ODI hundred. (Source: Reuters)

Different day, different clothing but similar result as India, riding on another Shikhar Dhawan‚Äôs brutal assault, thump Sri Lanka by nine wickets in the 1st ODI of the five-match series. The Blues replaced the Whites but it had no bearing on the manner in which Dhawan operated in the middle. The left-hander was on the charge from the word go and Rohit Sharma‚Äôs early departure, in the fifth over of the chase, didn‚Äôt affect his game one bit as he continued to find the fence on regular occasions.

Ever since he has landed in Sri Lanka, Dhawan is yet to put a foot wrong. In the series opener in Dambulla, he elegantly planted his front-foot forward against the seamers Lasith Malinga and Vishwa Fernando, and was very busy while facing the spinners. Lakshan Sandakan had a decent start to his spell when Dhawan misread the length and looked very clumsy when he missed the sweep but that probably was the only occasion when the chinaman disturbed the Delhi dasher.

Post that play and a miss, Dhawan used his feet well and was not afraid to step out on regular intervals. This disturbed the spinner‚Äôs rhythm and made him bowl at ordinary lengths which turned out to be easy pickings for an on-song Dhawan. He was fresh from a hundred in the last Test against Sri Lanka and he‚Äôs making sure to make the good run count.

Off 71 balls, he scored his fastest hundred in the format and gave the visitors no chance of a fightback in the contest. Just like he successfully did in the first Test. It took him just two sessions to deliver a blow which Sri Lanka couldn‚Äôt recover from in the remaining period of the Test. Sunday was no different.

The stand

Rohit Sharma‚Äôs early departure ‚Äì courtesy a lazy run ‚Äì could have raised Sri Lanka‚Äôs hopes of making the contest interesting but Dhawan was in no mood to bat himself in. 36 balls and he brought up his fifty and did the job in fluent fashion with Virat Kohli.

It was one of those rare occasions where Kohli was more of a spectator from the other end. The Indian skipper remained unbeaten on 82 and played a very fluent supporting role to Dhawan. The right-hander gave nothing away and looked very determined to see the side home in the modest chase.

Spin control

Earlier in the day, after put into bat, Sri Lanka were off to a solid start with Niroshan Dickwella, Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis getting off to starts but the hosts lost control in the middle-overs a triggered a slide which they could never recover from.

From 150/2, they collapsed to 187/8 as the lower-order failed to get going. Angelo Mathews remained unbeaten on 36 as the all-rounder got no support from the other end. For the visitors, Axar Patel was pick of the bowlers with figures of 3/34 while Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal and part-timer Kedar Jadhav returned with two wickets each.

India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, MS Dhoni, Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal

Sri Lanka: Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Upul Tharanga (c), Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedara, Wanindu Hasaranga, Thisara Perera, Lakshan Sandakan, Lasith Malinga, Vishwa Fernando.

US Navy to launch fleet-wide probe as search for 10 missing sailors goes on,"The collision tore a hole in the warship‚Äôs port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area. (AP) The collision tore a hole in the warship‚Äôs port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area. (AP)

Ships, aircraft and divers from an international search-and-rescue operation were still looking for 10 missing US sailors on Tuesday after a collision between a US warship and a merchant vessel in waters near Singapore and Malaysia.

The USS John S. McCain and the tanker Alnic MC collided early on Monday while the guided-missile destroyer was nearing Singapore for a routine port call. The collision tore a hole in the warship‚Äôs port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area.

The collision ‚Äì the fourth major accident in the US Pacific fleet this year ‚Äì prompted a fleet-wide investigation and plans for temporary halts in operations to focus on safety. The US Navy said in a statement late on Monday that aircraft from the amphibious assault ship the USS America, which was in port at Singapore‚Äôs Changi Naval Base, would continue searching for the missing sailors. They join aircraft and vessels from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia already searching in the area.

Damage control efforts on board the USS John S. McCain were focused on draining water from the ship and restoring auxiliary systems, and divers had started assessing the warship‚Äôs damaged hull, the statement said. A public affairs officer for the US Seventh Fleet told Reuters the USS John McCain remained pierside at Changi Naval Base and that a repair plan would be put in place after assessments were complete. Admiral Scott Swift, who serves as the Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, was in Kuala Lumpur on Monday and was scheduled to arrive in Singapore on Tuesday.

Singapore‚Äôs Maritime and Port Authority said search efforts had continued through the night. Video footage and still pictures showed that a wide hole was ripped in the John S. McCain‚Äôs aft port side. Five sailors were also injured in the accident, although the US Navy said none of those injuries was life-threatening.

On Monday, US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said there were no indications so far the collision was intentional or the result of cyber intrusion or sabotage. ‚ÄúBut review will consider all possibilities,‚Äù he said on Twitter.

Richardson said he was asking his fleet commanders worldwide for a one-to-two-day, staggered ‚Äúoperational pause‚Äù to discuss action to ensure safe and effective operations. He envisaged this could begin within a week. He also said a comprehensive review would examine the training of US forces deployed to Japan ‚Äúto make sure we are doing everything we can to make them ready for operations and warfighting‚Äù. The US Seventh Fleet is headquartered in Japan. This would include looking at ‚Äúoperational tempo, trends in personnel, materiel, maintenance and equipment,‚Äù Richardson said.

"Finnish killings treated as first terror attack, suspect ‚Äútargeted women‚Äù, says police","Emergency services working in Turku Market Square in Turku Finland on Friday. Police in Finland say they have shot a man in the leg after he was suspected of stabbing several people in the western city of Turku. (File) Emergency services working in Turku Market Square in Turku Finland on Friday. Police in Finland say they have shot a man in the leg after he was suspected of stabbing several people in the western city of Turku. (File)

Finnish police said on Saturday that an 18-year-old Moroccan man, arrested after a knife rampage that killed two people and wounded eight, appeared to have targeted women and that the spree was being treated as the country‚Äôs first terrorism-related attack. The suspect arrested following the attack on Friday after being shot in the leg by police in the city of Turku had arrived in Finland last year, police said. They said they later arrested four other Moroccan men over possible links to him and had issued an international arrest warrant for a sixth Moroccan national.

Finnish broadcaster MTV, citing an unnamed source, said the main suspect had been denied asylum in Finland. The police said only that he had been ‚Äúpart of the asylum process‚Äù.

The case marks the first suspected terror attack in Finland, where violent crime is relatively rare.

‚ÄúThe suspect‚Äôs profile is similar to that of several other recent radical Islamist terror attacks that have taken place in Europe,‚Äù Director Antti Pelttari from the Finnish Security Intelligence Service told a news conference.

The police said they were investigating possible links to Thursday‚Äôs deadly van attack in the Spanish city of Barcelona.

Both of those killed in the Turku attack, and six of the eight who were wounded, were women, the police said. The two who died were Finns, and an Italian and two Swedish citizens were among the injured.

‚ÄúIt seems that the suspect chose women as his targets, because the men who were wounded were injured when they tried to help, or prevent the attacks,‚Äù said Crista Granroth from the National Bureau of Investigation.

‚ÄúThe act was cowardly ‚Ä¶ we have been afraid of this and we have prepared for this. We are not an island anymore, the whole of Europe is affected,‚Äù Prime Minister Juha Sipila said.

SCREAMING

The stabbing spree occurred on Friday afternoon in the main market place in Turku, on the southwest coast of the country, 160 kilometres from Helsinki.

‚ÄúFirst thing we heard was a young woman, screaming like crazy. I thought it‚Äôs just kids having fun ‚Ä¶ but then people started to move around and I saw a man with a knife in his hand, stabbing a woman,‚Äù said Laura Laine, who was sitting in a cafe.

‚ÄúThen a person ran towards us shouting ‚ÄòHe has a knife‚Äô, and everybody from the terrace ran inside. Next, a woman came in to the cafe. She was crying hysterically, down on her knees, saying someone‚Äôs neck has been slashed open.‚Äù

Four of the wounded were still in hospital, three of them in intensive care, while the other injured persons would be sent home on Saturday, the hospital said.

Turku‚Äôs Iraqi, Syrian and Islamic community condemned the attacks and organised a rally of solidarity in the city‚Äôs main square, but decided to cancel it due to security concerns.

‚ÄúFinns and immigrants, and people from different religions, have had very good relations in Turku‚Ä¶ We are shocked, but I don‚Äôt see this changing that,‚Äù said Abdirahman Mohamed, Chairman of the Islamic community of Turku.

He said the Moroccan suspects were not familiar to him or to the Islamic community in town, which has around 2,000 members.

TENSIONS

An Anti-immigration mood has been on the rise in Finland since it received some 32,500 asylum seekers during the migration crisis in 2015.

Tensions simmered on Saturday Turku as the anti-immigration ‚ÄúFinland First‚Äù movement held a rally but it was met by counter-demonstrators brandishing signs saying ‚ÄúNo room for racism‚Äù.

In Helsinki, about 200 people gathered in the rain to protest against the construction of a mosque and Muslim immigration to Finland in a rally planned by the Finnish far-right group the Finnish Defence League (FDL) before the attack.

Some members of the nationalist Finns party, which was kicked out of the government in June for their new hard-line anti-immigration leadership, blamed the government for what they said was too loose an immigration policy.

‚ÄúThe asylum system is the primary road for illegal immigration, used also by the terrorists. Harmful immigration can be controlled only by reducing Finland‚Äôs attractiveness, or by border controls,‚Äù said Finns party lawmaker Ville Tavio. The government has already tightened immigration policies in the past few years, along with other Nordic states.

"Donald Trump to announce new Afghan, South Asia strategy: White House","President Donald Trump. (Source: Reuters) President Donald Trump. (Source: Reuters)

President Donald Trump will announce America‚Äôs new strategy in Afghanistan on Monday, amid reports that his administration could be mulling a role for India in ending the brutal and costly conflict, the US‚Äô longest war. Trump will make his first prime-time broadcast to the nation as president at 9 pm (7:30 am IST, Tuesday) to unveil his new plan after a lengthy period of deliberations to end nearly 16 years long war in Afghanistan.

The president will ‚Äúprovide an update on the path forward for America‚Äôs engagement in Afghanistan and South Asia,‚Äù White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. The address from the Fort Myer military base in Arlington, Virginia, will follow Defence Secretary Jim Mattis confirmation yesterday that the administration had decided on a new Afghan strategy after ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù debate.

The much-awaited policy announcement comes eight months after Trump became the US president and after criticism from some US lawmakers that he was struggling to make a decision. Trump‚Äôs predecessor, Barack Obama, had announced his Afghan policy in the first 100 days of his office. Defence Secretary James Mattis said yesterday that Trump‚Äôs policy review on the war and the entire US approach to South Asia ‚Äî Washington‚Äôs tortured ties with Pakistan and complaints that Islamabad is tacitly encouraging extremists ‚Äî had been finalised.

‚ÄúHe wants to be the one to announce it to the American people,‚Äù Mattis said. ‚ÄúHe now needs the weekend to collect his thoughts on how he‚Äôs going to explain it to the American people.‚Äù On Friday, Trump had a meeting with national security officials at Camp David to discuss the Afghan strategy. On Saturday, he tweeted: ‚ÄúImportant day spent at Camp David with our very talented Generals and military leaders. Many decisions made, including on Afghanistan.‚Äù

While Obama‚Äôs policy focused primarily on Afghanistan and Pakistan, reports said the Trump administration looked into possibilities for a role for India during its policy review. Months ago, the Pentagon had settled on a plan to send approximately 3,800 additional troops to help strengthen the Afghan Army, which is stuck in what some call a deteriorating stalemate with the Taliban insurgency.

US military commanders have often argued that additional troops would help the US to reverse gains made by the Taliban and other militant groups. Trump delegated authority to adjust troop levels to Mattis early in his administration, but he has been presented by the Pentagon with a range of options for the path forward, including a complete troop withdrawal and the deployment of up to 4,000 more soldiers to add to the more than 8,000 American forces that are already there.

Hopes that the US could finally leave Afghanistan have been checked by the Afghan government‚Äôs struggle to preserve order under a resurgent challenge from the Taliban and inroads made by extremist groups like al-Qaeda, ISIS and the Haqqani network.

Following the 2001 September 11 attacks, the US-led an invasion of Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The war eventually became the US‚Äô longest in history. The Afghan war had cost more than USD 1.07 trillion till 2014 end. According to fatalities monitoring website icasualties.org, 3,539 coalition soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, including 2,403 Americans, 455 British and 681 others.

This year, the Taliban offensive against the West-backed government in Kabul increased this summer. Reports said the the insurgent group in an ‚Äúopen letter‚Äù to Trump last week reiterated its calls for the withdrawal of all remaining US troops from Afghanistan.

Trump‚Äôs address to the nation follows the most polarising chapter of a presidency that has continually exacerbated political divisions.

His handling of the aftermath of violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, earlier this month has sparked outrage and accusations that Trump has tarnished the moral authority of his presidency.

"AIADMK factions merge in Tamil Nadu: 20 MLAs behind him, TTV Dinakaran to first target CM, meet Governor","In the 233-member Tamil Nadu House, Dinakaran has the support of at least 20 MLAs, a number that can endanger the majority the ruling party has in the Assembly. In the 233-member Tamil Nadu House, Dinakaran has the support of at least 20 MLAs, a number that can endanger the majority the ruling party has in the Assembly.

On the day the two AIADMK factions led by E K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam buried the hatchet and moved to oust party general secretary V K Sasikala, her loyalists, led by nephew and deputy general secretary T T V Dinakaran, had only one refrain: ‚ÄúParty is first‚Äù.

In the 233-member Tamil Nadu House, Dinakaran has the support of at least 20 MLAs, a number that can endanger the majority the ruling party has in the Assembly. Three Independents who were with him seemed to have switched sides.

Leaders backing Dinakaran and Sasikala‚Äôs brother Dhiwakaran said they cannot promise the stability of the Tamil Nadu government in the wake of the decision to move against Sasikala. These leaders indicated that their first target would be Palaniswami, and not the government. He will be asked to prove that he has the backing of all party MLAs. Should he fail, they will insist on another leader who has their backing as well.

Dinakaran has not yet responded to the merger. In a tweet addressed to reporters, he said: ‚ÄúAs I have sore throat and fever, doctor has advised me rest. Will meet you all on August 23rd.‚Äù

Of the 20 MLAs with Dinakaran, 18 claimed he had the support of 25 MLAs, that Palaniswami and Panneerselvam did not have the powers to call a meeting of the party general council or remove Sasikala from her post.

These MLAs said Dinakaran will meet Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao at 10 am Tuesday. His camp will submit a memorandum stating that the MLAs who elected Palaniswami six months ago have lost trust in him. They will demand his removal.

The Opposition DMK has so far remained silent. Its working president M K Stalin, who had earlier said he would move a no-confidence motion if required, did not discuss immediate plans during a brief interaction with reporters Monday.

Stalin said the AIADMK merger was scripted by the BJP ruling the Centre. ‚ÄúDelhi had prepared the storyline, both OPS and EPS have acted in it,‚Äù he said.

My judge and my jury is my Lord, Jesus Christ,‚Äù Chappelle-Nadal, who later deleted from post from her personal Facebook page, told reporters at a church in Ferguson. She had asked media outlets to not publish the news conference‚Äôs location beforehand because she‚Äôd received death threats since the post. ‚ÄúPresident Trump, I apologize to you and your family,‚Äù she added. She walked out and didn‚Äôt take any questions after delivering her three-minute statement. Chappelle-Nadal‚Äôs post was in response to one that suggested Vice President Mike Pence would try to have Trump removed from office. She has said she made the comment out of frustration with the Republican president‚Äôs response to the recent white nationalist rally and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, for which Trump said ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù shared some blame.

Chappelle-Nadal was later questioned by the U.S. Secret Service as part of its investigation into her remarks. She has told The Associated Press that she let the federal law enforcement agency know she ‚Äúhad no intentions of hurting anyone or trying to get other people to hurt anyone at all.‚Äù Parson has said he will ask senators to remove Chappelle-Nadal, who lives in the St. Louis suburb of University City, from office if she does not resign by the time lawmakers convene Sept. 13 to consider veto overrides.

The Missouri Constitution says a lawmaker can be expelled upon a two-thirds vote of the elected members of a chamber. But that hasn‚Äôt occurred in recent decades, and it‚Äôs unclear exactly how it would happen. Before Sunday‚Äôs apology, Chappelle-Nadal had only called the Facebook post ‚Äúimproper‚Äù and claimed she was being targeted by the governor and other officeholders because of political expediency or grudges.

‚ÄúYou know, what I‚Äôm reminded of is that we‚Äôre all human,‚Äù she said Sunday, seconds before voicing defiance about calls for her ouster. She also apologized to Missouri residents and her Statehouse colleagues. ‚ÄúI will continue to fight for issues that are really, really important,‚Äù said Chappelle-Nadal, who was a prominent voice during the protests in Ferguson after the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown. ‚ÄúGod chooses people for different things, to send different messages.‚Äù

"Muslim outfit hails talaq verdict, demands uniform civil code","MSM member and writer Mahboob Gaus Sayyad (Sayyadbhai) said the talaq verdict will give strength to Muslim women. (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav) MSM member and writer Mahboob Gaus Sayyad (Sayyadbhai) said the talaq verdict will give strength to Muslim women. (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav)

Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal (MSM), a progressive and reformist outfit, today welcomed the Supreme Court verdict to set aside the practice of divorce through triple talaq. Appealing to Muslims to welcome the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù verdict and the upcoming legislation, MSM president Shamsuddin Tamboli said the judgement will strengthen the movement demanding justice for Muslim women in the country.

‚ÄúDue to inbuilt limitations of the Supreme Court, it has asked the Central government to enact a legislation in the next six months and since Parliament is the topmost platform to enact laws in the country, Muslims should welcome today‚Äôs verdict and upcoming legislation wholeheartedly,‚Äù he said.

Founded by rationalist and thinker Hamid Dalwai in 1970, MSM has been campaigning for the rights of Muslim women. The organisation has been demanding scrapping of practices such as triple talaq, ‚Äònikah halala‚Äô and polygamy in Muslim community. Tamboli said it is now the responsibility of government to enact an effective law so that Muslim women will get the due respect and justice.

‚ÄúPrime Minister Narendra Modi has been talking about equal rights to Muslim women. Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal is looking at him with a lot of hope,‚Äù he said. Tamboli said the court today said they will not touch issues like polygamy and ‚Äòhalala‚Äô. ‚ÄúHowever, issues of Muslim women are not limited to triple talaq only. Polygamy, halala, adoption and the right to property are the real raging issues for the women. If all these issues are to be addressed, then the Muslim personal law should be reformed radically,‚Äù he said.

Tamboli said the government should also take a further step to implement Uniform Civil Code. ‚ÄúThe blueprint or the draft of the UCC should be prepared as soon as possible so that misunderstandings and misinterpretations about it will stop, as without a concrete draft of UCC, discussions on it will be futile and will lead nowhere,‚Äù he said.

MSM member and writer Mahboob Gaus Sayyad (Sayyadbhai) said the talaq verdict will give strength to Muslim women. One of the victims of triple talaq, Arshiya Bagwan, who was given an instant talaq by her husband over a petty issue last year, also welcomed the verdict.

Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh‚Äôs relationship has dominated gossip columns. For gossip mongers, the couple has broken up several times and have chosen their separate ways in life. But none of it affected the Bajirao Mastani actors. In fact, the duo has been painting the town red with their love for each other.

In the videos that have surfaced on the internet, we see the couple getting cosy. While Deepika is all smiles with Ranveer by her side, Ranveer cannot stop himself from embracing Deepika.

The videos are a testimony to their genuine friendship and immense comfort level.

However, a few reports have been doing the rounds that the PDA of the lovebirds has left filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali fuming as he doesn‚Äôt want another controversy around his period-drama Padmavati which stars the duo in pivotal roles.

17 schools refunded excess fee: Delhi Government,"Representational Image/ Express Representational Image/ Express

Even as the Delhi government‚Äôs proposal to take over 449 private unaided schools ‚Äúas a last resort‚Äù got the official nod by L-G Anil Baijal, government officials said at least 17 schools had already ‚Äúrefunded excess fee charged from parents despite government orders‚Äù. Officials maintained that the proposal would allow the schools to initially respond to the showcause notice within ‚Äútwo weeks‚Äù as to why ‚Äúthey should not be taken over the government‚Äù.

The official added, ‚ÄúThe L-G office has also cautioned the government to ensure that studies in the present term are not impacted.‚Äù In doing so, the L-G office echoed the concerns raised by the Delhi HC, which said that ‚Äúour paramount interest is to ensure that students don‚Äôt suffer‚Äù. Last week, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said, ‚ÄúThe schools will not be allowed to loot students like they used to do under previous governments due to political collusion. But if they don‚Äôt implement, we will take them over as a last resort. I hope we don‚Äôt have to take over.‚Äù

According to a government official, the amount collectively owed by the schools amounted to around Rs 300 crore. S K Bhattacharya, president of Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, said schools would respond to the showcause notices. ‚ÄúThere are two types of schools ‚Äî a large number of schools have grievances and are not satisfied with the order, and want to challenge it. Then there are some who have excess money, which they will refund,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBut government cannot take over schools unless and until there is substantial proof against them‚Ä¶ This is not a simple matter,‚Äù he added. DPS Mathura Road Principal Manohar Lal said he is yet to receive the order from the L-G‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúA writ petition in the matter would have been filed in the High Court today, or it will be filed tomorrow. We are ready to obey whatever the court says,‚Äù he said.

US slaps sanctions on 16 Russian and Chinese entities for supporting North Korea,"The sanctions target third-country companies and individuals that assist already-designated persons who support North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The sanctions target third-country companies and individuals that assist already-designated persons who support North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

The US today slapped sanctions on 10 Russian and Chinese companies and six individuals for helping in advancing North Korea‚Äôs missile and nuclear weapons programme by conducting business with the reclusive nation. As a result of today‚Äôs action, any property or interests in property of the designated persons in the possession or control of US persons or within the United States must be blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them, the US Treasury Department said in a statement.

The sanctions target third-country companies and individuals that assist already-designated persons who support North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, deal in the North Korean energy trade, facilitate its exportation of workers, and enable sanctioned North Korean entities to access US and international financial systems.

‚ÄúTreasury will continue to increase pressure on North Korea by targeting those who support the advancement of nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and isolating them from the American financial system,‚Äù said Treasury Secretary Steven T Mnuchin.

Some of the prominent companies and individuals slapped with sanctions are China-based Dandong Rich Earth Trading Co, Moscow-based Gefest-M LLC and its director, Russian national Ruben Kirakosyan and China and Hong Kong-based Mingzheng International Trading Limited.

‚ÄúIt is unacceptable for individuals and companies in China, Russia, and elsewhere to enable North Korea to generate income used to develop weapons of mass destruction and destabilise the region,‚Äù Mnuchin said. ‚ÄúWe are taking actions consistent with UN sanctions to show that there are consequences for defying sanctions and providing support to North Korea, and to deter this activity in the future,‚Äù he said.

The Treasury also designated three Chinese coal companies collectively responsible for importing nearly half a billion dollars‚Äô worth of North Korean coal between 2013 and 2016.

"I think this Indian team will win 2019 World Cup, says Axar Patel","Axar Patel picked up three wickets for 34 runs in his 10 overs against Sri Lanka on Sunday. (Source: Reuters) Axar Patel picked up three wickets for 34 runs in his 10 overs against Sri Lanka on Sunday. (Source: Reuters)

India started off their ODI series with a comfortable nine wicket win over Sri Lanka in Dambulla on Sunday. For India, left arm spinner Axar Patel was the pick of the bowlers, picking up three wickets for 34 runs in his 10 overs. After the match, India‚Äôs pacer Jasprit Bumrah spoke with Axar Patel on his performance in the match.

On being asked about the bowling plan and his emotions after getting selected into the squad, Axar said, ‚ÄúI am really happy to be back in the team after six or seven months, I was not too worried about making a comeback, I thought that I would continue the same way as I used to perform earlier, when playing for India.‚Äù

Jasprit also asked Axar about the game plan when Sri Lanka‚Äôs first wicket partnership was building up, to which he replied,‚ÄùInitially I planned to contain the Sri Lankan batsmen as they were scoring at a high rate and even I needed two overs to settle down, then I decided to go for wickets and felt really good when I got my first wicket after two overs.‚Äù

Axar also praised Shikhar Dhawan‚Äôs knock of unbeaten 132 runs and felt that he deserved the man of the match award, ‚ÄúReally happy to see Dhawan score and he deserved the man of the match and it feels good when the entire team is performing to their level best in every department, and are not dependent on individuals.‚Äù

On being asked about the change which he noticed in the current Indian Team from past six-seven months when Axar last played for India, he said, ‚ÄúAll players are young with the average age of 26-27 so I think this is a main factor and everyone is enjoying each other‚Äôs company. There is unity in the team which is helping us to gel up together so I think this team will win the 2019 ICC World Cup.‚Äù India will play their second ODI of the five match series on August 24 in Pallekele.

Ladakh scuffle: The importance of Pangong Tso,"The stunning Pangong Lake in Ladakh, a part of which is controlled by India, the rest by China. Manish Swarup/AP File photo The stunning Pangong Lake in Ladakh, a part of which is controlled by India, the rest by China. Manish Swarup/AP File photo

The video of the alleged scuffle between Indian and Chinese soldiers on the banks of Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh, posted online by Lt Gen Prakash Katoch (retd) on August 19, was visual confirmation of what had been reported about the incident that took place on Independence Day morning.

A day before the video surfaced, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs had confirmed ‚Äúan incident‚Äù, without going into details. The video, which the Army is yet to officially authenticate, shows unprecedented physical violence between the two sides ‚Äî including kicking and punching, the throwing of stones, and the use of sticks and steel rods, leading to severe injuries.

In normal course, the two patrols, after coming face to face, would have engaged in a ‚Äúbanner drill‚Äù, displaying a banner asking the other side to vacate its territory. This drill could last a few minutes to an hour ‚Äî but barring some occasional jostling, the two sides would disengage quietly. That the Chinese chose to initiate violence against the Indians this time, can be linked to the state of heightened tensions between the two armies due to the two month-old standoff at Doklam on the Sikkim border.

But why did this incident take place at Pangong Tso, 1,300-odd km west of Sikkim? What is Pangong Tso, and why is it important to the two sides?

***

In the Ladakhi language, Pangong means extensive concavity, and Tso is lake in Tibetan. Pangong Tso is a long narrow, deep, endorheic (landlocked) lake situated at a height of more than 14,000 ft in the Ladakh Himalayas. The western end of Pangong Tso lies 54 km to the southeast of Leh. The 135 km-long lake sprawls over 604 sq km in the shape of a boomerang, and is 6 km wide at its broadest point.

The brackish water lake freezes over in winter, and becomes ideal for ice skating and polo. The legendary 19th century Dogra general Zorawar Singh is said to have trained his soldiers and horses on the frozen Pangong lake before invading Tibet.

The Line of Actual Control (LAC) cuts through the lake, but India and China do not agree on its exact location. As things stand, a 45 km-long western portion of the lake is in Indian control, while the rest is under China‚Äôs control. Most of the clashes between the two armies occur in the disputed portion of the lake.

A grab from the video of the alleged clash posted online by Lt Gen Prakash Katoch A grab from the video of the alleged clash posted online by Lt Gen Prakash Katoch

By itself, the lake does not have major tactical significance. But it lies in the path of the Chushul approach, one of the main approaches that China can use for an offensive into Indian-held territory. Indian assessments show that a major Chinese offensive, if it comes, will flow across both the north and south of the lake. During the 1962 war, this was where China launched its main offensive ‚Äî the Indian Army fought heroically at Rezang La, the mountain pass on the southeastern approach to Chushul valley, where the Ahir Company of 13 Kumaon led by Maj. Shaitan Singh made its last stand. This was made memorable in Chetan Anand‚Äôs 1964 war film, Haqeeqat, starring Balraj Sahni and Dharmendra.

Not far away, to the north of the lake, is the Army‚Äôs Dhan Singh Thapa post, named after Maj. Dhan Singh Thapa who was awarded the country‚Äôs highest gallantry award, the Param Vir Chakra. Maj. Thapa and his platoon were manning Sirijap-1 outpost which was essential for the defence of Chushul airfield. The award was announced posthumously for Maj. Thapa, as reflected in the citation, but he was subsequently discovered to have been taken prisoner by the Chinese. He rejoined his unit after being released from the PoW camp.

Over the years, the Chinese have built motorable roads along their banks of the Pangong Tso. At the People‚Äôs Liberation Army‚Äôs Huangyangtan base at Minningzhen, southwest of Yinchuan, the capital of China‚Äôs Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, stands a massive to-scale model of this disputed area in Aksai Chin. It points to the importance accorded by the Chinese to the area.

***

Even during peacetime, the difference in perception over where the LAC lies on the northern bank of the lake, makes this contested terrain. In 1999, when the Army unit from the area was moved to Kargil for Operation Vijay, China took the opportunity to build 5 km of road inside Indian territory along the lake‚Äôs bank. Last Tuesday‚Äôs skirmish took place in this area. The 1999 road added to the extensive network of roads built by the Chinese in the area, which connect with each other and to the G219 Karakoram Highway. From one of these roads, Chinese positions physically overlook Indian positions on the northern tip of the Pangong lake.

The mountains on the lake‚Äôs northern bank jut forward in major spurs, which the Army calls ‚Äúfingers‚Äù. India claims that the LAC is coterminous with Finger 8, but it physically controls area only up to Finger 4. Chinese border posts are at Finger 8, while Indian border posts are located close to Finger 3.

On the water, the Chinese had a major advantage until a few years ago ‚Äî their superior boats could literally run circles around the Indian boats. But India purchased better boats some five years ago, leading to a quicker and more aggressive response. Although there are well-established drills for disengagement of patrol boats of both sides, the confrontations on the waters have led to tense situations in the past few years. The induction of high speed boats has ostensibly provoked the Chinese, who have responded by increasing the number of transgressions in this area in recent years.

***

Finally, if you go as a tourist to see the lake that the climax scene of Aamir Khan‚Äôs 3 Idiots made famous, will you be able to travel up to the Chinese border?

No, because tourists are only allowed up to Spangmik village, around 7 km into the lake. In fact, tourists were not allowed at all at Pangong Tso until 1999, and even today, you need to obtain an Inner Line Permit from the office of the Deputy Commissioner at Leh. Scenes of Indian and Chinese soldiers allegedly clashing on the lake or on its banks will per force have to be limited to videos posted by retired generals.

"On morning walk, 22-year-old drowns in Hauz Khas lake, Delhi","This is the third incident of drowning in the lake in the last nine months. Express This is the third incident of drowning in the lake in the last nine months. Express

A 22-year-old man from Manipur drowned in Hauz Khas lake while on a morning walk with his friends, police said. The incident took place around 5.30 am Monday. Police said Horthan had come to Delhi from Manipur on July 27 and was staying with his cousins at a rented accommodation in Maharani Bagh. Police said he was in the capital in search of a job. Police said that around 6 am, they received a call from the Deer Park lake at Hauz Khas. A team rushed to the spot and found Horthan‚Äôs friends, Yurthing and Rizat, standing near the lake and screaming for help.

His friends told police that Horthan wanted to take a dip, so he took his clothes off and went into the water. Eyewitness, however, claimed that the three were playing near a boat on the periphery of the lake. Police called divers from the fire department and started to look for Horthan. They also called the staff responsible for cleaning the lake and, following a two-hour search operation, the body was fished out of the lake, police said. Police have recorded the statements of his friends and family. His sister works at a call centre in Delhi, while his parents and two siblings live in Manipur. The body has been handed over to the family following an autopsy, police said, adding that an inquest proceeding has been initiated.

This is the third incident of drowning at the lake in the past nine months. In December, 2016, a boy who had come to the lake with his friends drowned, while in March, an elderly woman on a morning walk accidentally slipped and fell into the lake.

Donald Trump to visit section of US-Mexican border wall in Arizona,"Donald Trump has said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first. (Photo: Reuters) Donald Trump has said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first. (Photo: Reuters)

President Donald Trump will visit a section of a US-Mexican border fence in Arizona on Tuesday as he seeks congressional funding for the wall he wants built, administration officials said on Monday. Trump, who has struggled to persuade the Republican-led Congress to approve funding for a project many see as unnecessary, is to visit a border facility at Yuma, Arizona.

The border area at Yuma is considered a success story for the US Border Patrol because illegal crossings have slowed as a result of the border installation. During his visit, Trump will be briefed on Border Patrol efforts in the region and the need for more funding for immigration and border officials to carry out the Republican president‚Äôs desire for sharp limits on illegal immigration, the officials said.

The proposed border wall, aimed at preventing illegal immigration to the United States, was one of Trump‚Äôs major 2016 campaign promises. His vow that Mexico would pay for the wall, which the Mexican government has insisted it will not do, has strained relations between the two neighbors. Trump has since said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first.

"Tottenham Hotspur vs Chelsea: Marcos Alonso scores incredible goals, watch videos","Marcos Alonso scored brace in the match against Tottenham. (Source: Reuters) Marcos Alonso scored brace in the match against Tottenham. (Source: Reuters)

The thrilling match between Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea has given a kickstart to the Premier League‚Äôs new season as the tough fight between the top two teams of last season ended with 2-1 in the favour of the Blues. The Spurs had a spectacular run last season, ending unbeaten at home. However, in the first Premier League match taking place at Wembley, they went down to reigning champions Chelsea after a hard fought battle.

While Marcos Alonso scored two brilliant goals for Chelsea, the match that was in Tottenham‚Äôs domination saw an own goal by Mitchy Batshuayi that equalised the game with six minutes to go for the final whistle.

Here are the three goals from the London derby:

The outfits portray glamour and power and the message is to strive harder every day to be more. Our Johnnie Walker inspired collection is an extension of my belief that like the striding man, every individual must keep walking through whatever hardships come across our path,"" said Asa.



Ali Fazal walked the ramp for the designer.

Asa has always presented fearless fashion and this season he brought ‚ÄòInvincible‚Äô haute couture with his customary strong, styling, elements. For the designer, fashion has to be beyond simplicity so the mix of ancient warriors‚Äô influences and contemporary punk culture made a dramatic, emphatic, style statement on the ramp. Asa worked only with a fabric base that comprised leather and denim but detailing was once again with the intelligent use of metal work that featured chains, spikes and fringes. The sharply cut garments in myriad silhouettes offered structural cuts, detailing and were further enhanced with clever embroidery.

Ending the show was the ‚Äòtrue blue warrior‚Äô Vidyut Jamwal, whose leather /denim jacket, multi pocket pant with zippered detailing and vest proved that he was all ready to fight it out. And that is just what the Commando actor did on the ramp! He demonstrated his expertise with two swords in a perfect warrior like demeanour.

Shreeya Somaiya's collection was inspired by Carine Roitfeld‚Äôs CR fashion book on Marie Antoinette. Marie Antoinette, the last queen before the French Revolution was the ultimate risk taker of the time in terms of being bold and edgy. The designer's take was to contemporise and make the fashion wearable for the modern Indian women. The silhouettes had a wide range including Duchess satin slip dresses, asymmetric skirts, jackets and shift dresses in soft pink and crimson with ruffle detailing.

White shirts under denim bustier and jackets, with pearl edging, teamed with a scarlet and pale pink tulle skirts with 3D flowers appliques were other impressive looks. Organza, chiffon and denim were the fabrics used to create innovative textures along with pearl and crystals to reinvent the charm of the astonishing historical figure. The designer improvised the jewels and accessories of that era and infused them as surface ornamentation while floral appliqu√©s were another technique used to add to the ladylike approach to the line.

Making a strong fashion statement with his new colour forecast, Ujjawal Dubey for his label Antar Agni at Lakme Fashion Week Winter/festive 2017 unveiled his ‚ÄòDisobedient‚Äô collection for both men and women. Ujjawal‚Äôs construction and designing techniques have been his signature that has revolutionised the concept of menswear and womenswear. His new line amalgamated the timeless quality of eastern classic silhouettes with international trends, thus bringing a certain amount of disobedience to his collection.

Menswear had the characteristic asymmetric silhouettes for waist coats and kurtas. Knit sherwanis, collarless shirts and shawl collar jackets made for great fashion statements.

Womenswear had a gentle, feminine, touch with stark shapes. Asymmetrical, double-breasted coat and dress were simple with machine embroidery; while jumpsuits with side pockets looked comfortable and relaxed. The double-breasted dress with a soft backless coat, grey midi with cowl cover, two-toned kurta, maxi dress with asymmetric cover and rouched back drape proved it was a balanced collection.

Delhi based duo Monika and Nidhi brought together a line that was exquisite, yet, experimental in its own way. Pernia Qureshi gracefully walked the ramp in an embellished ivory lehenga with stylised choli that had intricate details. It was the perfect winter wedding outfit for the new age women.

The collection had all the elements for a perfect fairy tale, right from the extravagant ensembles to the fragile embroidery and the vintage style quotient. The silhouettes were an ode to the Victorian era, but a contemporary twist was given to the ballroom skirts teamed with well-tailored corsets, cholis, cropped tops with elongated sleeves and capes with feather and fringe detail along with a metallic sari that sparkled like pixie dust. Waists were cinched to add a more figure-hugging accent to the collection.

Georgette, tulle, organza, satin and crepe were the fabrics chosen to construct this mystical labour of love. Salmon pink, colonial blue, Edwardian vanilla and jade were the hues picked to glorify the narration of tales from the ancient period.

When the inspirations for the collection are the draping styles of the Buddhist monks with the multiple layers and interesting waist belts; then the look has to be serene, spiritual and sophisticated. Divyam Mehta's 'The Black Monk' collection at Lakm√© Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 had subtle glamour. With the collection predominantly in black and cement grey, the effortless styling was interpreted with layered drapes, skirts, and relaxed wide leg monk trousers. Divyam also took a hint of inspiration from the artworks of French artist Jean Degottex to give a more comprehensive angle to his theme and designs.

The delicate Shibori patterns and interesting block prints gave an innovative texturing to the handloom wool and matka silks. But it was the imaginative Kantha work from Bengal and the thread embroidery that finally completed the ethereal look. The menswear started with a fluid kurta and loose trousers, black/ white coat, cropped/crushed shirt and dhoti pants. The low buttoned double-breasted jacket with draped baggy pants was an interesting addition. The cowled waistcoat worn with matching pants and jacket was an unusual version; while the Sherwani/shawl and bundi/kurta combos with asymmetric lapels and the black/white poncho with low-crotch pleated pant further confirmed the theme of the show.

When it comes to the colourful fantasy of digital prints, Ajay Kumar is the master of the genre. For Lakm√© Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017, the designer's 'Bhu-Svah' collection was inspired by the beauty, culture, flora, and fauna of India. The collection brought to the forefront the sustainability of style with the use of natural fabrics."
"Donald Trump rules out hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, warns Pakistan for support to terror","US President Donald Trump. (Reuters Photo) US President Donald Trump. (Reuters Photo)

The US on Tuesday ruled out a hasty withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan as President Donald Trump warned Pakistan of consequences if it continues to provide safe havens to terror groups and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. Trump, in a prime-time televised address to the nation, laid out his South Asia policy saying a ‚Äúcritical part‚Äù of it was to further develop US‚Äô strategic partnership with India.

He said after a ‚Äúcomprehensive review‚Äù, it has been decided that the American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically.

‚ÄúA core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions. I‚Äôve said many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance, the dates we intend to begin, or end, military operations,‚Äù Trump said in his address.

‚ÄúWe will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities,‚Äù Trump said as he announced his South Asia policy in front of about 2,000 people from all five services and top officials of his administration.Trump slammed Pakistan for its continued support to terrorist groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so.

‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúPakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists,‚Äù he said, in a apparent warning to Pakistan.

The US President reached out to India seeking an enhanced role for New Delhi, especially in the economic field, to bring peace and stability in Afghanistan. India, the world‚Äôs largest democracy, is a key security and economic partner of the United States, he said.

‚ÄúWe appreciate India‚Äôs important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development,‚Äù Trump said.

(AP Photo/Bullit Marquez)

The Philippines has deployed more troops to cull thousands of chickens one day after the farm ministry confirmed the spread of bird flu into a second province north of the capital, Manila. More than 100 soldiers were sent on Saturday to the towns of Jaen and San Isidro in Nueva Ecija province after two cases of avian flu were detected in quails, army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Isagani Nato said in a statement.

The new bird flu cases were about 50 km (30 miles) from the initial outbreak in a swampy area of Pampanga that is a sanctuary for migratory birds from China. Authorities have not determined the cause of the bird flu outbreak, nor the exact strain, on which tests are being done in Australia. There has been no case of human transmission in either outbreak, and early tests have ruled out lhighly pathogenic H5N1 strain.

Nato said the deployment in Nueva Ecija followed a request from the Bureau of Animal Industry in the Department of Agriculture for assistance ‚Äúafter confirming a new incident of bird flu outbreak‚Äù. He said troops were now undergoing training on how to do their jobs. The 300 soldiers sent to Pampanga on Thursday culled nearly 30,000 chicken from a farm within a one kilometre radius of the first bird flu outbreak. The farm ministry said about 600,000 chickens on about 36 farms in Pampanga will be culled. It did not say how many will be culled in the second province.

"Digvijaya Singh slams Centre, Congress response more guarded","Digvijay Singh (Express) Digvijay Singh (Express)

While the Congress officially reacted in a guarded manner on the bail for Lt Col Prasad Purohit, only asking why the government is giving extensions to the tenure of the NIA chief, party general secretary Digvijaya Singh alleged that the NDA government is protecting all accused connected with the RSS in blast cases.

Soon after the Supreme Court granted bail to Purohit, Digvijaya Singh said it was expected, as the Central government is protecting the accused connected with RSS. Hours later, at the official party briefing, senior leader Manish Tewari was guarded when asked about the role of the NIA in the probe. ‚ÄúWith regard to the NIA, we are not in the business of extrapolating or speculating about motives,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThere is a chargesheet which has been filed‚Ä¶ The matter is under adjudication, and a trial court will determine guilt or innocence,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhether NIA is fulfilling its responsibility, or whether it is weakening the case, the matter is before the trial court. And if anybody feels that things are not proceeding in accordance with the law, then those people‚Ä¶they have knock on the doors of the apex court.‚Äù

About the NIA chief‚Äôs tenure, Tewari said: ‚ÄúIt is surprising this government has not been able to find a single competent officer to head the NIA‚Ä¶these repeated extensions have been frowned upon by the Supreme Court.‚Äù ENS

Lebanon army advances against Islamic State in border battle along Syria,"Lebanon‚Äôs military estimated around 600 IS fighters were present in the Jurud Ras Baalbek and Jurud al-Qaa areas, controlling around 120 square kilometres of territory before Saturday‚Äôs advances.

Lebanese soldiers renewed fire on Islamic State group positions on the country‚Äôs eastern border with Syria today after capturing a third of the territory held by jihadists in the area. Lebanon‚Äôs army began its operation in the Jurud Ras Baalbek and Jurud al-Qaa region early on Saturday, and in the first day captured around 30 square kilometres of territory, a military spokesman said.

‚ÄúThat is around a third of the area controlled by the terrorists,‚Äù Brigadier General Nazih Jreij said late Saturday. Jreij said 20 IS fighters had been killed in the clashes, and 10 Lebanese soldiers wounded. Lebanon‚Äôs battle against IS comes as the jihadist group faces assaults in both neighbouring Syria and Iraq, where the government early Sunday announced an offensive on the group‚Äôs bastion of Tal Afar.

The attack also comes after IS claimed several international attacks, including twin car ramming incidents in Spain that killed 14 people. Lebanese soldiers raised the Spanish flag on a hilltop captured from IS on Saturday in a tribute to the victims of those attacks, the army said.

Lebanon‚Äôs military estimated around 600 IS fighters were present in the Jurud Ras Baalbek and Jurud al-Qaa areas, controlling around 120 square kilometres of territory before Saturday‚Äôs advances. On Sunday, Lebanon‚Äôs National News Agency reported soldiers were firing heavy artillery and rockets at IS positions in Jurud Ras Baalbek.

The army‚Äôs assault comes after Lebanon‚Äôs powerful Shiite militant group Hezbollah waged its own campaign against jihadists operating in another border area south of the current battle. The group‚Äôs six-day offensive against IS and Al-Qaeda‚Äôs former affiliate in the Jurud Arsal area ended with a ceasefire.

The agreement saw around 8,000 refugees and jihadists transported to a jihadist-held area of northwestern Syria in return for the release of five captured Hezbollah fighters.

Hezbollah said Saturday it had launched a simultaneous operation against IS from the Syrian side of the border, where the group‚Äôs fighters are battling alongside President Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs army against rebels. Lebanon‚Äôs army denied any coordination with Hezbollah or the Syrian army.

Hezbollah‚Äôs War Media outlet said its fighters and the Syrian army had on Saturday ‚Äúmanaged to liberate 87 square kilometres of the total area controlled by the Daesh (IS) organisation‚Ä¶ in western Qalamun region‚Äù of Syria.

Donald Trump warns Pakistan against providing safe havens to terrorists: Full text of his speech,"‚ÄúIn Afghanistan and Pakistan, America‚Äôs interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter‚Äù, Donald Trump said. ‚ÄúIn Afghanistan and Pakistan, America‚Äôs interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter‚Äù, Donald Trump said.

Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Tillerson, members of the Cabinet, General Dunford, Deputy Secretary Shanahan, and Colonel Duggan. Most especially, thank you to the men and women of Fort Myer and every member of the United States military at home and abroad.We send our thoughts and prayers to the families of our brave sailors who were injured and lost after a tragic collision at sea, as well as to those conducting the search and recovery efforts.

I am here tonight to lay out our path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia. But before I provide the details of our new strategy, I want to say a few words to the servicemembers here with us tonight, to those watching from their posts, and to all Americans listening at home.

Since the founding of our republic, our country has produced a special class of heroes whose selflessness, courage, and resolve is unmatched in human history. American patriots from every generation have given their last breath on the battlefield for our nation and for our freedom. Through their lives ‚Äî and though their lives were cut short, in their deeds they achieved total immortality.

Donald Trump: India‚Äôs role critical in Afghanistan‚Äôs stability; Pakistan must stop sheltering terrorists

By following the heroic example of those who fought to preserve our republic, we can find the inspiration our country needs to unify, to heal, and to remain one nation under God. The men and women of our military operate as one team, with one shared mission, and one shared sense of purpose.

They transcend every line of race, ethnicity, creed, and color to serve together ‚Äî and sacrifice together ‚Äî in absolutely perfect cohesion. That is because all servicemembers are brothers and sisters. They‚Äôre all part of the same family; it‚Äôs called the American family. They take the same oath, fight for the same flag, and live according to the same law. They are bound together by common purpose, mutual trust, and selfless devotion to our nation and to each other.

The soldier understands what we, as a nation, too often forget that a wound inflicted upon a single member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all. When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. And when one citizen suffers an injustice, we all suffer together.

Loyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another. Love for America requires love for all of its people. When we open our hearts to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, no place for bigotry, and no tolerance for hate.

The young men and women we send to fight our wars abroad deserve to return to a country that is not at war with itself at home. We cannot remain a force for peace in the world if we are not at peace with each other.

As we send our bravest to defeat our enemies overseas ‚Äî and we will always win ‚Äî let us find the courage to heal our divisions within. Let us make a simple promise to the men and women we ask to fight in our name that, when they return home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one.

Thanks to the vigilance and skill of the American military and of our many allies throughout the world, horrors on the scale of September 11th ‚Äî and nobody can ever forget that ‚Äî have not been repeated on our shores.

But we must also acknowledge the reality I am here to talk about tonight: that nearly 16 years after September 11th attacks, after the extraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure, the American people are weary of war without victory. Nowhere is this more evident than with the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in American history ‚Äî 17 years.

I share the American people‚Äôs frustration. I also share their frustration over a foreign policy that has spent too much time, energy, money, and most importantly lives, trying to rebuild countries in our own image, instead of pursuing our security interests above all other considerations.

That is why, shortly after my inauguration, I directed Secretary of Defense Mattis and my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of all strategic options in Afghanistan and South Asia.

My original instinct was to pull out ‚Äî and, historically, I like following my instincts. But all my life I‚Äôve heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office; in other words, when you‚Äôre President of the United States. So I studied Afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle. After many meetings, over many months, we held our final meeting last Friday at Camp David, with my Cabinet and generals, to complete our strategy. I arrived at three fundamental conclusions about America‚Äôs core interests in Afghanistan.

First, our nation must seek an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made, especially the sacrifices of lives. The men and women who serve our nation in combat deserve a plan for victory. They deserve the tools they need, and the trust they have earned, to fight and to win.

Second, the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable. 9/11, the worst terrorist attack in our history, was planned and directed from Afghanistan because that country was ruled by a government that gave comfort and shelter to terrorists. A hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum that terrorists, including ISIS and al Qaeda, would instantly fill, just as happened before September 11th.

And, as we know, in 2011, America hastily and mistakenly withdrew from Iraq. As a result, our hard-won gains slipped back into the hands of terrorist enemies. Our soldiers watched as cities they had fought for, and bled to liberate, and won, were occupied by a terrorist group called ISIS. The vacuum we created by leaving too soon gave safe haven for ISIS to spread, to grow, recruit, and launch attacks. We cannot repeat in Afghanistan the mistake our leaders made in Iraq.

Third and finally, I concluded that the security threats we face in Afghanistan and the broader region are immense. Today, 20 U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations are active in Afghanistan and Pakistan ‚Äî the highest concentration in any region anywhere in the world.

For its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and terror. The threat is worse because Pakistan and India are two nuclear-armed states whose tense relations threaten to spiral into conflict. And that could happen.

No one denies that we have inherited a challenging and troubling situation in Afghanistan and South Asia, but we do not have the luxury of going back in time and making different or better decisions. When I became President, I was given a bad and very complex hand, but I fully knew what I was getting into: big and intricate problems. But, one way or another, these problems will be solved ‚Äî I‚Äôm a problem solver ‚Äî and, in the end, we will win.

We must address the reality of the world as it exists right now ‚Äî the threats we face, and the confronting of all of the problems of today, and extremely predictable consequences of a hasty withdrawal.

We need look no further than last week‚Äôs vile, vicious attack in Barcelona to understand that terror groups will stop at nothing to commit the mass murder of innocent men, women and children. You saw it for yourself. Horrible.

As I outlined in my speech in Saudi Arabia three months ago, America and our partners are committed to stripping terrorists of their territory, cutting off their funding, and exposing the false allure of their evil ideology.

Terrorists who slaughter innocent people will find no glory in this life or the next. They are nothing but thugs, and criminals, and predators, and ‚Äî that‚Äôs right ‚Äî losers. Working alongside our allies, we will break their will, dry up their recruitment, keep them from crossing our borders, and yes, we will defeat them, and we will defeat them handily.

In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America‚Äôs interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter.

But to prosecute this war, we will learn from history. As a result of our comprehensive review, American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically in the following ways:

A core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions. I‚Äôve said it many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance the dates we intend to begin, or end, military options. We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities.

Conditions on the ground ‚Äî not arbitrary timetables ‚Äî will guide our strategy from now on. America‚Äôs enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out. I will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will.

Another fundamental pillar of our new strategy is the integration of all instruments of American power ‚Äî diplomatic, economic, and military ‚Äî toward a successful outcome.

Someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but nobody knows if or when that will ever happen. America will continue its support for the Afghan government and the Afghan military as they confront the Taliban in the field.

Ultimately, it is up to the people of Afghanistan to take ownership of their future, to govern their society, and to achieve an everlasting peace. We are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live, or how to govern their own complex society. We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.

The next pillar of our new strategy is to change the approach and how to deal with Pakistan. We can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond. Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists.

In the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner. Our militaries have worked together against common enemies. The Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism. We recognize those contributions and those sacrifices.

But Pakistan has also sheltered the same organizations that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country‚Äôs harboring of militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order, and to peace.

Another critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States. We appreciate India‚Äôs important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.

Finally, my administration will ensure that you, the brave defenders of the American people, will have the necessary tools and rules of engagement to make this strategy work, and work effectively and work quickly.

I have already lifted restrictions the previous administration placed on our warfighters that prevented the Secretary of Defense and our commanders in the field from fully and swiftly waging battle against the enemy. Micromanagement from Washington, D.C. does not win battles. They are won in the field drawing upon the judgment and expertise of wartime commanders and frontline soldiers acting in real time, with real authority, and with a clear mission to defeat the enemy.

That‚Äôs why we will also expand authority for American armed forces to target the terrorist and criminal networks that sow violence and chaos throughout Afghanistan. These killers need to know they have nowhere to hide; that no place is beyond the reach of American might and Americans arms. Retribution will be fast and powerful.

As we lift restrictions and expand authorities in the field, we are already seeing dramatic results in the campaign to defeat ISIS, including the liberation of Mosul in Iraq.

Since my inauguration, we have achieved record-breaking success in that regard. We will also maximize sanctions and other financial and law enforcement actions against these networks to eliminate their ability to export terror. When America commits its warriors to battle, we must ensure they have every weapon to apply swift, decisive, and overwhelming force.

Our troops will fight to win. We will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.

We will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy with additional troop and funding increases in line with our own. We are confident they will. Since taking office, I have made clear that our allies and partners must contribute much more money to our collective defense, and they have done so.

In this struggle, the heaviest burden will continue to be borne by the good people of Afghanistan and their courageous armed forces. As the prime minister of Afghanistan has promised, we are going to participate in economic development to help defray the cost of this war to us.

Afghanistan is fighting to defend and secure their country against the same enemies who threaten us. The stronger the Afghan security forces become, the less we will have to do. Afghans will secure and build their own nation and define their own future. We want them to succeed.

But we will no longer use American military might to construct democracies in faraway lands, or try to rebuild other countries in our own image. Those days are now over. Instead, we will work with allies and partners to protect our shared interests. We are not asking others to change their way of life, but to pursue common goals that allow our children to live better and safer lives. This principled realism will guide our decisions moving forward.

Military power alone will not bring peace to Afghanistan or stop the terrorist threat arising in that country. But strategically applied force aims to create the conditions for a political process to achieve a lasting peace.

America will work with the Afghan government as long as we see determination and progress. However, our commitment is not unlimited, and our support is not a blank check. The government of Afghanistan must carry their share of the military, political, and economic burden. The American people expect to see real reforms, real progress, and real results. Our patience is not unlimited. We will keep our eyes wide open.

In abiding by the oath I took on January 20th, I will remain steadfast in protecting American lives and American interests. In this effort, we will make common cause with any nation that chooses to stand and fight alongside us against this global threat. Terrorists take heed: America will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat.

Under my administration, many billions of dollars more is being spent on our military. And this includes vast amounts being spent on our nuclear arsenal and missile defense.

In every generation, we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed. We prevailed because we know who we are and what we are fighting for.

Not far from where we are gathered tonight, hundreds of thousands of America‚Äôs greatest patriots lay in eternal rest at Arlington National Cemetery. There is more courage, sacrifice, and love in those hallowed grounds than in any other spot on the face of the Earth.

Many of those who have fought and died in Afghanistan enlisted in the months after September 11th, 2001. They volunteered for a simple reason: They loved America, and they were determined to protect her.

Now we must secure the cause for which they gave their lives. We must unite to defend America from its enemies abroad. We must restore the bonds of loyalty among our citizens at home, and we must achieve an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the enormous price that so many have paid.

Our actions, and in the months to come, all of them will honor the sacrifice of every fallen hero, every family who lost a loved one, and every wounded warrior who shed their blood in defense of our great nation. With our resolve, we will ensure that your service and that your families will bring about the defeat of our enemies and the arrival of peace.

We will push onward to victory with power in our hearts, courage in our souls, and everlasting pride in each and every one of you.

Thank you. May God bless our military. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.

6 hours of rain stops Tricity in its tracks,"Waterlogged streets of Phase5 in Mohali on Monday. (Express Photo by Jasbir Malhi) Waterlogged streets of Phase5 in Mohali on Monday. (Express Photo by Jasbir Malhi)

SIX HOURS, 15 minutes; and 134 mm rain. That is how much it poured over Tricity in just one quarter of the day, completely disrupting life in Chandigarh for the better part of Monday. City Beautiful‚Äôs drainage proved simply inadequate for the ferocity with which the skies opened up to dump water on the region, resulting in the mother of all deluges.

Residential sectors, arterial roads, inner lanes, parks ‚Äî nothing was spared today as the rain began pounding from about 6.30 am until about 10 am, and then intermittently with less intensity for about a couple of hours more. Across the city, vehicles stood paralysed on roads filled with water.

Commuters spent hours stranded in their vehicles till the situation returned to normal sometime after 12.30 pm. Parks turned into lakes. Water entered homes. The city‚Äôs low-lying areas were the worst affected. Monday‚Äôs rainfall was the highest for the month of August in 13 years. ‚ÄúBy 8.30 am the city had received about 18.8 mm rain. From 8.30 am to 12:15 pm the rainfall recorded was 115.2 mm,‚Äù said Ashu Dogra, an official of Chandigarh Met department.

Skymet, a private weather forecaster, said 112 mm rain fell between 8.30 am and 11.30 am. Before this, the city received 241.6 mm rainfall over an entire day in August 3, 2004. Mayor Asha Jaswal conceded that the Municipal Corporation does not have any action plan if the city receives such high rainfall. She acknowledged the problems faced by city residents and said since the last house meet, the corporation had been looking for ways to handle the problem.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt deny that currently, the city does not have any plan for the density of the rain which the city has received today but certainly we are talking with experts and consultants to help the MC have a proper action plan. Since the time when the city was designed, we have preparations for only 50mm rainfall,‚Äù Jaswal told Chandigarh Newsline.

A team of mayor, municipal commissioner and area councillors also visited rain-affected areas. The mayor said that during their visit, the officials found that Mauli Jagran, Vikas Nagar, Sector 18, 19 Sadar Bazar, Sector 21 and Hallo Majra were the worst affected as water had entered houses. ‚ÄúWe have identified the spots. A meeting with officials has been called on Wednesday,‚Äù said Jaswal.

Chandigarh residents struggled to go about their everyday chores as it poured. Sanjeev Malhotra, a resident of Sector 40-C, Chandigarh, said, ‚ÄúMy son studies in a private school in Sector 37. On normal days it takes me only 20 minutes to drop him but today due to waterlogging, commuting became a difficult task as it took me almost 45 minutes to reach Sector 40-41 light points. Later, because of the waterlogging at the school, my car was stopped in the middle of the road. As a result, I had to return leaving my car there.‚Äù

Many two-wheeler riders could be seen pushing their bikes and scooters, while pedestrians, including schoolchildren, waded through thigh-deep water at many places. ‚ÄúThe downpour not only paralysed the life of the residents but also exposed the tall claims of the MC officials. My daughter studies at Government School in Sector 40-B, Chandigarh, which is hardly 10 minutes away from my house. Since it was raining, so I took my cycle to drop but even my street was flooded with water. I assisted several motorcyclists as their vehicles stopped and they had to push the vehicles to move them off the street,‚Äù said Sagar, a resident of Sector 41, Chandigarh.

Good News on Sukhna Front

n One positive outcome amid all the disruption caused by Monday‚Äôs heavy downpour was the increase in the water level of Sukhna Lake by 2.30 ft, raising it from 1,158 feet to 1,160.30 feet. A senior officer said, ‚ÄúA team of engineering department recorded the water level of Sukhna as 1,160.30 feet. On Sunday, it was recorded at 1,158 feet. The present water level is sufficient in the lake. Now we don‚Äôt think the lake will dry up.‚Äù Sukhna‚Äôs water had reached the same level ‚Äî 1,160.30 feet ‚Äî three years ago as well, the official said. In 2016, the highest water level of the lake was 1,157 feet.

Long weekend getaways for 2017: Where are you going for Ganesh Chaturthi?,"Everyone needs a holiday, so why not plan ahead for yours. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Everyone needs a holiday, so why not plan ahead for yours. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Did you spend most of last year grumbling about how you didn‚Äôt get to travel much; how work pressure was too much and there wasn‚Äôt any time to take a break? Well then, let that not be an excuse for 2017, because this year has a whole host of long weekends (some you may need to work around, but then what are casual leaves and sick leaves for?) for you to make good use of. So far we‚Äôve identified 14 of them, of which two (in August and October) can give you nine full days of vacation fun if only strategically add a couple of extra days.

We took inspiration from our own travels, added inputs from travel experts from Cleartrip, TravelTriangle, Travkart, Expedia, Skyscanner, etc., to come up with this. Check them out.

Hit the beach by going to Goa or Diu. The weather is perfect for water sports and fun. Love the snow? Then trek up to Auli or Parashar Lake for the weekend. You can even head to Dubai to catch the fag end of the Dubai shopping festival.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to Goa for Mardi Gras, or towards Shimla and Fagu for a relaxing weekend in the hills.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to the hills for some chill time, and to catch a bit of snow if you‚Äôre lucky. Options could include Shimla‚Äôs outskirts or McLeodganj to the north, a hilly trek towards Malshej to the west, or even Puri or Digha in the east.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: 1/2

Where to go: Head to Singapore for some weekend fun. There is much to do and see, and the destination can be covered fairly well over four days.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: 1

Where to go: If you‚Äôre health conscious and a tad bit religious, then you could head towards Rishikesh for a Yoga retreat during this weekend. Or attend the Aoleang festival, held during the first week of April, along with the Konyak tribe in Nagaland.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you like nature and a bit of hiking, then head towards McLeodganj or a bit higher up towards Triund. It‚Äôs an easy hike for those who have never trekked before and gives you the most stunning views.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to Orchha for a quick weekend trip, or Pondicherry or Coorg if you‚Äôre in southern India. This a good time to head to these places before summer comes by in full swing.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to places that are known for their non-vegetarian and Mughlai fare, such as Hyderabad, Lucknow and Ajmer.

Total days: 9

Extra leaves: 2/3

Where to go: If you take just two leaves, you have nine full days for a mini vacation, and the weather is perfect for a sojourn to Europe. Head to Eastern European countries such as Greece, Croatia, Hungary and Poland. There‚Äôs a lot to cover, and it works well for the budget traveller as well.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you plan really tight, this is the season to head to the Valley of flowers in Uttarakhand for a mini trek, and you can also go up to the Hemkund Sahib gurudwara, which is the highest gurudwara in the world.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you‚Äôre really fond of beer, then a quick visit to Munich for the Oktoberfest (on till October 3) may not be a bad idea. This is also a bucket list item for many, so why not! If you‚Äôre around Mumbai, then Karjat may be a viable option or if you want to head towards the North East then Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh is a great option. Though the music festival happens in September, you can always find local pubs with live music and there are, of course, some picturesque hiking trails.

Total days: 9

Extra leaves: 4

Where to go: Nine days is like a mini vacation, so make full use of it. October is a good month for a Vietnam-Cambodia trip, or just one of these countries, if you don‚Äôt want to rush it. Eastern Europe is also a good bet since it would be just before the severe winter sets in. In India, a trek through Spiti valley would give you stunning vistas to gorge upon, or if you haven‚Äôt been to Rajasthan yet, then a road trip is highly recommended.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Dhanaulti, Ranikhet, Mukteshwar, Manali, Binsar and Chakrata are all hill stations that would not only be a refreshing change, but also give stunning views of the snow-capped Himalayas. In southern India, Pondicherry or Kovalam are lovely seaside destinations worth considering.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Let‚Äôs face it, Goa is an obvious choice for this three-day weekend, and that‚Äôs for a reason. But if you‚Äôd rather not hit the crowded streets and beaches, and love snow then Manali and Rohtang Pass could be good options, even Auli is covered in white at this time of the year.

Indonesia angered after Malaysia shows its flag as Poland‚Äôs,"Indonesia‚Äôs national flag, printed upside down, is seen on the guidebook of the Opening Ceremony of the 29th South East Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017.

(AP Photo/Yau)

Indonesia has accused the Malaysian organizers of the Southeast Asian Games of negligence after the Indonesian flag was printed upside down in a souvenir guidebook. The mistake, which makes the red-and-white Indonesian flag resemble Poland‚Äôs, has caused anger in Indonesia where ‚Äúshameonyoumalaysia‚Äù has become the most popular hashtag on Twitter.

Indonesia‚Äôs Olympic Committee chairman Erick Thohir said the mistake ‚Äúshows negligence‚Äù and demanded the guidebook be withdrawn and a new version printed. ‚ÄúFriendship is the greatest legacy in sports, but a mistake in presenting a national identity is not justified,‚Äù he said.

Indonesia appears to have taken particular offense because the guidebook was distributed to VIPs at Saturday‚Äôs opening ceremony in Kuala Lumpur for the 29th Southeast Asian Games and only its flag was shown incorrectly. Youth and Sports Minister Imam Nahrawi said the error was ‚Äúvery painful.‚Äù

President Joko ‚ÄúJokowi‚Äù Widodo also called for an apology but cautioned against exaggerating the incident. ‚ÄúWe are waiting for an apology from the Malaysian government because this is related to the pride of our nation,‚Äù Jokowi said Sunday.

The Malaysian Organizing Committee said its chairman and Malaysia‚Äôs sports minister would meet with Nahrawi to apologize. ‚ÄúWe very much regret the mistake,‚Äù it said in a statement.

Malaysia and Indonesia are both Muslim majority nations and share a similar language but often trade accusations of stealing the other‚Äôs food and culture. The creation of Malaysia when the British empire was dismantled after World War II was bitterly opposed by Indonesia, itself then a new nation emerging from Dutch colonial rule and a short-lived Japanese occupation.

On Twitter, Indonesians said their flag represents the sacrifices of independence heroes and accused Malaysia of either being stupid or deliberately misprinting it. ‚ÄúYou know, this is maybe the reason why our founding father Soekarno wanted to Kick Your Ass,‚Äù said one user.

The Committee said it has established the man‚Äôs identity, confirming him to be a local resident born in 1994.

According to the regional police, officers present at the scene fired warning shots before taking down the suspect who was wearing a balaclava. A statement released by the regional government said, two out of the seven injured are in critical condition. The city lies some 2,100 kilometers northeast of Moscow in the oil-rich Khanty-Mansi region.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic expected to sign new Manchester United contract this week: Reports,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic is expected to rejoin Manchester United. (Source: Reuters) Zlatan Ibrahimovic is expected to rejoin Manchester United. (Source: Reuters)

If reports are to be believed, Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be joining Manchester United by the end of this week. The 35-year old, who was the highest goalscorer for the Red Devils last season, is recovering from a knee ligament injury that he suffered during the Europa League match against Anderlecht back in April.

Even though the injury is expected to keep him out of football action till 2018, a report by espn said that he is going to sign a new contract with the Old Trafford club which will be announced during this week. The development has taken place owing to the his quick recovery from knee ligament.

While he was linked to clubs like LA Galaxy, Ibrahimovic is set to return to United where he scored 17 times in 27 Premier League starts, racking up 28 goals overall. He goals were followed by Marcus Rashford and Henrikh Mkhitaryan at 11 each.

Manager Jose Mourinho had last week expressed his desire to get the Swedish player back on board. He had said, ‚ÄúWe are discussing the possibility of him to stay with us. It was very clear from him that what he did last year was not enough for him. He wants more football at the highest level so we are having conversations and discussing the possibility of him staying for the second part of the season.

‚ÄúHe is injured, he needs time to recover, and is not ready to play tomorrow. It‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs urgent, it‚Äôs not desperate to have it done or not.‚Äù

United had signed the 35-year old on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in June 2016. Post his departure, United signed striker Romelu Lukaku from Everton, who has been shining at the start of United‚Äôs league season, scoring a brace on his debut.

"Man kills wife, her mother over ‚Äòhonour‚Äô","Representational Image Representational Image

‚ÄúFamily honour‚Äù led a man from Bulandshahr to allegedly strangle his wife and mother-in-law and dump their bodies in an abandoned train in Shahdara, police said Monday. The bodies of Nishu, 28, and Maya Devi, 55, were recovered on August 17 by an official of the Railway Protection Force patrolling the tracks.

DCP (Railways) Parwaiz Ahmed said a man identified as Pushpender has been arrested. ‚ÄúHe told us he was upset that his wife and mother-in-law would often leave the house without telling him. He said villagers would talk about this, and the ‚Äòpride‚Äô of his family was at stake,‚Äù said Ahmed.

Police said Maya Devi‚Äôs husband died last year, while Nishu lost her daughter a few months ago. On August 16, when the two women left the house without telling Pushpender, he decided to kill them, police said. When they returned, he said he wanted to take them to a house he had bought in Delhi. The next day, they took a train to Shahdara.

There, he told them to ‚Äúchange trains‚Äù, and led them to the abandoned one, police said. Once inside, he asked them to stay in separate coaches. He first strangled Nishu, and then Maya Devi, before fleeing. The next day, he lodged a missing persons complaint at his village. ‚ÄúHowever, a probe is on and we can‚Äôt rule out the property angle,‚Äù said Ahmed.

Police quash Quebec City anti-racism demonstration after clashes,"A demonstrator lights a flare before throwing it during an anti-racism demonstration in Quebec City. (Source: AP) A demonstrator lights a flare before throwing it during an anti-racism demonstration in Quebec City. (Source: AP)

Clashes erupted between police and dozens of anti-racist activists on the sidelines of a pro-immigration rally in Quebec City, while a demonstration organised by extreme-right activists gained little traction. A few hundred people gathered in Quebec City‚Äôs center yesterday to counter-protest a planned far-right rally, supporters of which spent much of the day stuck in a parking lot.

In a bid to keep the two rallies apart, police erected a security cordon but declared the anti-racist demonstration illegal after sporadic clashes broke out and hooded individuals threw projectiles at police. ‚ÄúGiven acts of violence and vandalism, this demonstration is illegal,‚Äù tweeted the Quebec police, adding that one protester had been arrested.

The counter-demonstration was organized in response to a rally planned by La Meute, a far-right, anti-immigration group. The group called on Quebec residents to demand from the government ‚Äúsovereignty‚Äù of borders. In addition to 40,000 refugees Canada has accepted since the end of 2015, many migrants have fled north across the US-Canada border since the swearing-in of President Donald Trump, who espouses hardline immigration views.

In the first half of 2017 some 6,500 asylum seekers entered Canada. Approximately 7,000 have entered the North American country via Quebec since early July, about 6,000 of them Haitians. They face expulsion from the United States at the end of the year, when temporary asylum granted to 60,000 Haitians affected by a devastating 2010 earthquake is due to expire.

The World No. 9 Indian, playing with white pieces, started the game on an attacking note and gained an advantage in the initial stages of the game. However, the 12-year-old lad from Azerbaijan put up a staunch fight to contain the attacking Indian, but couldn‚Äôt do so as Harika took the game away from him after 40 moves.

‚ÄúI got off to a great start and gained an advantage in the initial phases of the game but a few miscalculated moves from my end got me in a complicated position,‚Äù Harika said.

‚ÄúAlthough when we were both were under the pressure of the clock and both kings were under attack, I outplayed him with a few strategies of my own,‚Äù she added.

After seven rounds in the nine-round Swiss tournament, Harika has amassed a total of four and a half points, courtesy three wins, three draws and just one loss. She has broken into the top-10 of the standings.

Title: When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan‚Äôs Poetics

Author: Guillermo Rodriguez

Publisher: Oxford University Press

Pages: 576

Price: Rs 1195

I am always wary of being told how to read a poet. When it is a poet whose work I care for, my resistance increases. And so, it was somewhat guardedly that I picked up this book on AK Ramanujan, a writer towards whom I feel not mere admiration, but gratitude and a very real kinship.

Every writer creates his own precursors, wrote the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges. For me, AKR is a precursor for several reasons. I have long enjoyed the philosophical restlessness, the quiet self-deprecating irony, the unobtrusive rigour of his poetry. I recently revisited his translations of Nammalvar and was struck all over again by his alchemic ability to transform a 1,000-year-old poet into our contemporary ‚Äî urgent, fearless, hoarse with longing and naked greed. AKR, at such times, becomes a precursor because, as translator, he uncovers for us an entire literary genealogy to which we can now claim allegiance.

More recently, on re-reading poems like ‚ÄòFear No Fall‚Äô, that moving evocation of the Tamil saint poet Arunagiri, I have felt a growing curiosity about the intersections between AKR as poet-intellectual and as a translator of ecstatic mystical verse. These later poems seem to offer glimpses of the poet as pilgrim, one who values literary poise and precision, but yearns also for the inspired self-forgetfulness of ‚Äòpossession‚Äô.

What makes Rodriguez‚Äôs volume rewarding is the fact that he shares the wonder of discovering AKR. Drawing on scholarly essays as well as AKR‚Äôs own private journals and unpublished work, it adopts an approach that is ‚Äòboth context sensitive and reflexive‚Äô, formal and biographical, academic and introspective, allowing each category to interrogate and nourish the other. And, underlying this whole exercise, is a passionate curiosity about AKR. Through this multifocal lens, we are offered fascinating access to the mind of the poet ‚Äî chronically incapable of rigidity or narrowness, hungry for places where beauty meets truth, often fractured by self-doubt, reluctant to rest content with easy victories, and always deeply, instinctively exploratory.

There is nothing schematic or critically legislative about this volume. It constantly invites the reader to look beyond pat binaries: east-west, akam-puram, interior-exterior, emotional-intellectual, insider-outsider, private-public, mother tongue-father tongue, little tradition-big tradition. Nuancing each category, it cautions us from reading AKR‚Äôs journey as that of the homesick exile, rediscovering his Indian roots in a foreign land. Instead, it reminds us of the complexity and variety of his inheritance in India, his ability to draw upon his Tamil and Kannada literary background without resorting to a chauvinist discourse, and his stout refusal to see either the Western or the Indian as monolithic categories.

‚ÄòBetween‚Äô becomes the operative word here. It signifies an awareness of the hyphen as a tremendous possibility that allows for a condition of multiple citizenship. Indeed, Ramanujan wryly described himself as ‚Äúthe hyphen in Indo-American studies‚Äù.

The book is liberally peppered with interesting quotes. In one, Ramanujan calls himself ‚Äúa multiple monolingual‚Äù. In another: ‚ÄúIt looks as if I live between things all the time ‚Äî two (or more) languages, two countries, two disciplines.‚Äù Or, yet again: ‚ÄúThe whole question of roots is not relevant to me‚Ä¶ India is me and with me‚Ä¶‚Äù And again, ‚ÄòIt takes some time before you realise that there are limits your culture has placed on you. Only they are not just limits. They are also resources.‚Äô

AKR‚Äôs image of his childhood home as a multi-tiered cultural abode (he imbibed Tamil from his mother, Sanskrit and English from his father) is significant in its refusal to posit an immutable divide between inside and outside, mother and father tongue: ‚Äú[There was] a downstairs for the Tamil world, an upstairs for the English and the Sanskrit, and a terrace on top that was open to the sky‚Ä¶ Each had a literature that was unlike the others‚Ä¶and it became the business of a lifetime for some of us to keep the dialogues and quarrels alive and to make something of them.‚Äù

There is no cultural machismo here ‚Äî no impulse to celebrate akam over puram, foundation over terrace. Indeed, how can there be when the terrace is always open to the wilderness of sky ‚Äî always challenging any snug, self-serving, static identity, aware of the tensions and ambiguities within each tradition, forever inviting us to discovery?

The ideal book on AKR, says Rodriguez, would ‚Äòhave to be written by a multidisciplinary team comprising a cultural anthropologist, a literary critic and theorist, a specialist in modern Indian poetry in English and Kannada, a Sanskritist, a Dravidian literature expert, a folklorist, a linguist, a translator and a poet‚Äô. Or, he adds, all of the above! One sees his point. It is a tall order. And yet, I suspect a vital key to understanding Ramanujan lies in seeing him foremost as a poet. It is the poet‚Äôs capacity to revel in metaphor and slippage, to distrust the rigidly ideological and doctrinaire, to doubt deeply and yet stay open to mystery, that, I imagine, made Ramanujan the inspired translator and scholar he was.

This, then, is the enduring contribution of this volume: the insight that it offers into inner workings of the mind of a remarkable writer-scholar, his capacity to remain poised between identities, to see their ruptures and continuities, without giving in to the extremes of foaming parochialism or glib internationalism. We rediscover Ramanujan as our culturally sophisticated contemporary ‚Äî more fascinating and more urgently relevant to our lives than ever before. Arundhathi Subramaniam is an award-winning poet and author.

Australian citizenship crisis erodes support for government,"Turnbull‚Äôs centre-right coalition government trails the opposition Labor party by a margin of 54-46, a Newspoll for the Australian newspaper showed, the lowest since February 2017 when support for Turnbull hit its lowest level.

(Photo: Reuters)

Australia‚Äôs government hit a six-month low in a widely-watched opinion poll on Monday, with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull‚Äôs one-seat majority in jeopardy over a citizenship crisis which could see three cabinet ministers thrown out of parliament. Australia‚Äôs parliament has been rocked by the revelation that seven politicians, including three ministers, are dual citizens, potentially ruling them ineligible to hold elected office. Turnbull‚Äôs centre-right coalition government trails the opposition Labor party by a margin of 54-46, a Newspoll for the Australian newspaper showed, the lowest since February 2017 when support for Turnbull hit its lowest level.

At the same time support for the far-right One Nation party jumped two points. One Nation leader Senator Pauline Hanson drew political rebuke last week when she wore a burqa in parliament as part of a campaign to ban the burqa on security grounds.

The next national election is not due until 2019, but continued poor polling may entice a leadership challenge to Turnbull, says political analysts.

‚ÄúVoters seem to have made up their mind that this government under Turnbull is not effective. The only way he can turn it around is to get the citizenship issue out of the way quickly,‚Äù said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia.

The High Court of Australia will this week set out a timetable for ruling on the eligibility of the seven politicians under a citizenship cloud. A 116-year-old law demands an elected lawmaker only have Australian citizenship, but some have discovered they hold dual citizenship by descent of a father being born in another country, such as neighbouring New Zealand.

Australian Attorney-General George Brandis said on Sunday said a final decision was unlikely before mid-October. Labor leader Bill Shorten called on the High Court to disqualify the seven politicians. ‚ÄúThe constitution needs to be upheld and honoured,‚Äù Shorten told reporters in Sydney.

"Central Bank, Dena Bank slash savings interest rates","Central Bank of India and Dena Bank on Monday reduced interest rates on savings accounts. While both banks reduced the rate by 50 basis points (bps) to 3.5 per cent per annum, the cuts apply to different buckets. At Central Bank, the cut will apply to savings accounts with balances of up to Rs 50 lakh. Accounts with higher balances will continue to earn 4 per cent. Dena Bank has reduced the rate on accounts with balances of up to Rs 25 lakh. For balances of above Rs 25 lakh, the rate remains unchanged at 4 per cent.

Most major banks recently dropped savings rates to 3.5 per cent, following SBI‚Äôs decision to do so for savings accounts with balances of up to Rs 1 crore.

HDFC Bank, Bank of Baroda, PNB, Axis Bank, Yes Bank and Karnataka Bank are among the lenders who have announced a cut in their rates.

Union Bank pays 3.5 per cent on savings accounts with balances of up to Rs 25 lakh.

Meanwhile, a PTI report has said that Bank of India is considering reducing the Savings Bank account rate and also the interest rate on deposits. ‚ÄúA cut on both the SB rate and interest on deposits are on the cards.

Nigeria‚Äôs President Muhammadu Buhari, in an address to the nation after returning from London where he spent more than three months for medical treatment, said his government will reinvigorate its campaign against the Islamic extremist insurgency in the country‚Äôs northeast. ‚ÄúTerrorists and criminals must be fought and destroyed relentlessly so that the majority of us can live in peace and safety,‚Äù said Buhari in a televised speech on Monday.

‚ÄúTherefore we are going to reinforce and reinvigorate the fight not only against elements of Boko Haram which are attempting a new series of attacks on soft targets, kidnappings, farmers versus herdsmen clashes, in addition to ethnic violence fueled by political mischief makers. We shall tackle them all.‚Äù Buhari returned Saturday to Abuja, though he didn‚Äôt make any comments upon his arrival to Abuja.

In his address, Buhari,74, did not say what ailment caused him to leave Nigeria in May for the lengthy treatment in Britain. He thanked Nigerians for their prayers. ‚ÄúI am pleased to be back on home soil among my brothers and sisters,‚Äù Buhari said.

The government of Africa‚Äôs most populous nation has never said what exactly has been ailing Buhari and his long absences have led some to call for his replacement and for the military to remind its personnel to remain loyal. Earlier this year Buhari spent seven weeks in London for treatment and said he had never been so sick in his life.

In his address, Buhari talked about political divisions, urging that Nigeria must be united. He said that while he was in London he kept in touch with daily events at home. ‚ÄúNigerians are robust and lively in discussing their affairs, but I was distressed to notice that some of the comments, especially in the social media have crossed our national red lines by daring to question our collective existence as a nation. This is a step too far,‚Äù he said.

Nigeria‚Äôs ongoing challenges include the deadly Boko Haram insurgency, a weak economy and one of the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crises, with millions malnourished in the northeast. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has been acting president during Buhari‚Äôs time abroad.

President Donald Trump to address nation on new US Afghan policy,"President Donald Trump. President Donald Trump.

President Donald Trump will address the US troops and the nation on his plans for Afghanistan and South Asia, the White House has said.

‚ÄúPresident Donald J Trump will address our nation‚Äôs troops and the American people tomorrow night at 9:00 pm (EDT) from Fort Myer in Arlington, VA, to provide an update on the path forward for America‚Äôs engagement in Afghanistan and South Asia,‚Äù White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

On Friday, Trump had a meeting with his national security officials at Camp David. On Saturday, Trump said he has taken a decision on his new Afghan policy. The much-awaited policy announcement comes eight months after he became the US President.

Former President Barack Obama had announced his Afghan policy in the first 100 days of his office, which was based on the recommendations of a three-member committee. While Obama‚Äôs Afghan policy focused primarily on Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Trump Administration during its policy review looked into possibilities of role and responsibilities of India.

Last week, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had said that Trump administration has almost reached a decision on a new approach for fighting the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan. Months ago the Pentagon had settled on a plan to send approximately 3,800 additional troops to help strengthen the Afghan army, which is stuck in what some call a deteriorating stalemate with the Taliban insurgency.

Afghanistan has been battling insurgency for more than a decade. The Taliban offensive against the west-backed government in the country increased this summer.

Vitamin C jabs may stave off blood cancer: Study,"To determine the effect of mutations that reduce TET2 function in abnormal stem cells, the team genetically engineered mice such that the scientists could switch the TET2 gene on or off.

(Photo: Thinkstock/Representational)

Vitamin C injections may halt the progression of blood cancer by encouraging faulty stem cells in the bone marrow to die, a study in mice has found. Certain genetic changes are known to reduce the ability of an enzyme called TET2 to encourage stem cells to become mature blood cells, which eventually die, in many patients with certain kinds of leukemia, researchers said. ‚ÄúWe are excited by the prospect that high-dose vitamin C might become a safe treatment for blood diseases caused by TET2-deficient leukemia stem cells, most likely in combination with other targeted therapies,‚Äù said Benjamin Neel, professor at New York University (NYU) in the US.

Changes in the genetic code (mutations) that reduce TET2 function are found in 10 per cent of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 30 per cent of those with a form of pre-leukemia called myelodysplastic syndrome, and in nearly 50 per cent of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

Such cancers cause anemia, infection risk, and bleeding as abnormal stem cells multiply in the bone marrow until they interfere with blood cell production, with the number of cases increasing as the population ages. Researchers studied the relationship between TET2 and cytosine, one of the four nucleic acid ‚Äúletters‚Äù that comprise the DNA code in genes.

To determine the effect of mutations that reduce TET2 function in abnormal stem cells, the team genetically engineered mice such that the scientists could switch the TET2 gene on or off. They found that similar to the naturally occurring effects of TET2 mutations in mice or humans, using molecular biology techniques to turn off TET2 in mice caused abnormal stem cell behaviour. These changes were reversed when TET2 expression was restored by a genetic trick.

Previous studies had shown that vitamin C could stimulate the activity of TET2 and its relatives TET1 and TET3.

Since only one of the two copies of the TET2 gene in each stem cell is usually affected in TET2-mutant blood diseases, researchers hypothesised that high doses of vitamin C, which can only be given intravenously, might reverse the effects of TET2 deficiency by turning up the action of the remaining functional gene.

They found that vitamin C did the same thing as restoring TET2 function genetically. By promoting DNA demethylation, high-dose vitamin C treatment induced stem cells to mature, and also suppressed the growth of leukemia cancer stem cells from human patients implanted in mice. ‚ÄúInterestingly, we also found that vitamin C treatment had an effect on leukemic stem cells that resembled damage to their DNA,‚Äù said Luisa Cimmino, assistant professor at NYU Langone Health.

Researchers combined vitamin C with a PARP inhibitor, a drug type known to cause cancer cell death by blocking the repair of DNA damage. They found that the combination had an enhanced effect on leukemia stem cells, further shifting them from self-renewal back toward maturity and cell death.

The results also suggest that vitamin C might drive leukemic stem cells without TET2 mutations toward death, given that it turns up any TET2 activity normally in place, Cimmino said. The study was published in the journal Cell.

"Sheena Bora murder case: ‚ÄòWas neither offered money nor demanded any‚Äô, says Shyamvar Rai","Sheena Bora (File) Sheena Bora (File)

ACCUSED-TURNED-approver in the Sheena Bora murder case, Shyamvar Rai, has told the court that he was neither offered any money nor had he demanded any from main accused Indrani Mukerjea, Rai said this during cross-examination by defence advocate for Mukerjea, Sudeep Pasbola, on Monday.

When Rai was asked if he had immediately agreed during the first Skype call by Indrani to join the conspiracy to murder Bora, he said yes. He was then asked if he had felt scared. ‚ÄúI was told by Indrani madam that I had nothing to fear and that my job would only be that of a driver. I was employed with her, so I agreed,‚Äù he told the court.

Rai was also asked about the Skype calls made in March 2012 by Indrani to him where the alleged conspiracy was discussed. Rai told the court that this took place at the Thane office of INX Media. ‚ÄúI do not have any document to show that I went there. I do not know if the company had any record,‚Äù Rai said when asked if any attendance register was maintained at the office to prove his presence.

Rai also submitted that he had taken the Khar police to a few places including the place near National College from where Bora was allegedly kidnapped on August 24, 2012. The cross-examination will continue on September 4.

UP Police gets on toes to tackle ‚ÄòBlue Whale Challenge‚Äô,"‚ÄòBlue Whale Challenge‚Äô is a controversial internet game in which a series of tasks, mostly brutal, are given to players for a period of 50 days ‚ÄòBlue Whale Challenge‚Äô is a controversial internet game in which a series of tasks, mostly brutal, are given to players for a period of 50 days

Wary of the impact of the ‚ÄòBlue Whale Challenge‚Äô, the Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday issued directives to police chiefs of all districts to ban the internet-based game that has been linked to several deaths of children worldwide. Expressing concern over the reports of the harmful impact of the game, Director General of Police Sulkhan Singh asked them to make efforts to contact school authorities and ensure that children are prevented from playing the game. He also called for legal action against administrators of the lethal game, which is said to have originated from Russia before spreading to other countries.

The Union Information Technology ministry, while taking serious cognizance of the incidents of suicides, has directed social media platforms such as Facebook, Google and Instagram to remove links of the controversial game from their sites, a statement from the DGP office said.

‚ÄúInstructions have also been issued to report any instance of the game being broadcast to law enforcement agencies. The Ministry of Home Affairs has also directed for taking appropriate action in this regard,‚Äù it said. The administrators of the ‚ÄòBlue Whale Challenge‚Äô use social media to misguide the children, who eventually harm themselves physically, DGP Singh said.

‚ÄúThis is indeed very worrying. The district police should make the people aware about the prevailing evil. Efforts should also be made to contact school principals to ban students from playing the game. Parents have been advised to consult a counsellor and initiate legal action against the administrator of the game,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄòBlue Whale Challenge‚Äô is a controversial internet game in which a series of tasks, mostly brutal, are given to players for a period of 50 days by the administrators with a final challenge requiring them to commit suicide. The player is asked to share photos after finishing the different levels of the game. The game is spread via links on social media platforms.

"Two dead, children trapped after quake hits Italian holiday island of Ischia","People standing near a collapsed building following an earthquake in Casamicciola on the Italian resort island of Ischia. An earthquake rattled the island at the peak of tourist season Monday night. (@percy80 via AP) People standing near a collapsed building following an earthquake in Casamicciola on the Italian resort island of Ischia. An earthquake rattled the island at the peak of tourist season Monday night. (@percy80 via AP)

A magnitude-4.0 earthquake struck the Italian holiday island of Ischia, causing destruction that left two people dead at peak tourist season, authorities said, as rescue workers struggled on Tuesday to free two children from the rubble.

A woman was killed in Casamicciola, in the north of the small tourist island, hit by debris that fell from a church, with the body of another spotted in the rubble of a collapsed house, local media reported. Around 4am (0200 GMT) emergency workers rescued a seven-month-old baby, crying but alive, after hours of effort. They were still struggling to free the baby‚Äôs two brothers, who were alive but trapped and communicating with emergency services through the rubble, according to Naples prefecture.

According to local media, the two children, aged 4 and 7, are trapped under a bed but are in touch with rescue workers by phone. It was their pregnant mother, healthy and safe, who raised the alarm. The father was rescued at 2:30am (0130 GMT).

‚ÄúIn Casamicciola, a building collapsed and three people were pulled alive from the rubble ‚Äî two women and a man,‚Äù the head of the local department of civil protection, Angelo Borrelli, said at a press conference early Tuesday. Two small communes, Casamicciola and neighbouring Lacco Ameno, had borne the brunt of the quake, he added.

The tremor hit the northwest of the island at 8:57 pm (1957 GMT), with a depth of some 10 kilometres. Italian authorities first put Monday‚Äôs quake at 3.6, but subsequently revised it upward to 4.0 magnitude. The main earthquake was followed by 14 smaller aftershocks, Borrelli said. Several buildings in the area collapsed and others had large, ominous cracks.

The Rai News 24 television channel broadcast images of holidaymakers by their cars with their bags packed, with other people sitting in their gardens or outside their houses. According to local media, many cars were waiting at Ischia port eager to head back to Naples as soon as possible. One ferry left at 2:30 am and another was scheduled for two hours later.

The quake struck just days ahead of the first anniversary of the 6.0 magnitude quake that killed nearly 300 people in and around Amatrice in central Italy. In October 2016 and January 2017 three other earthquakes hit the same region. ‚ÄúI was on the couch watching TV. Blackout, shaking, something fell on my head. I scream, my mother grabs me and we ran outside,‚Äù one witness wrote on Twitter.

The quake response has benefited from the presence of emergency responders who happened to already be on the island to fight the forest fires that have plagued Italy this summer, local media said. Teams of firefighters, including two units specialised in extracting people from the rubble, were quickly mobilised, said Bruno Frattasi, who oversees the fire department.

Ischia‚Äôs only hospital was also hit and had to be partially evacuated. Five patients were evacuated to another medical facility by helicopter. Restaurants were packed and many stores were still open when the shaking began, witnesses said on Twitter. ‚ÄúA horrible experience, everything was shaking, plunged into darkness, houses were collapsing‚Ä¶ a nightmare,‚Äù a witness wrote on Twitter. Electricity was restored after just a few minutes, but many people stayed outdoors after the quake, reluctant to go inside.

Ischia has been a frequent victim of earthquakes, with its worst dating back over a century. Estimated at a magnitude of 5.8, it killed over 2,000 people in July 1883. Much of Italy‚Äôs land mass and some of its surrounding waters are prone to seismic activity with the highest risk concentrated along its mountainous central spine. Italy straddles the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, making it vulnerable to seismic activity when they move.

"More potent, safer Zika vaccine developed","Scientists have developed the world‚Äôs first plant-based Zika vaccine. (Representational Image) Scientists have developed the world‚Äôs first plant-based Zika vaccine. (Representational Image)

Scientists have developed the world‚Äôs first plant-based Zika vaccine that may be more effective, safer and cheaper than other vaccines against the mosquito-borne virus. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available to combat Zika, researchers said. The vaccine developed by researchers from Arizona State University (ASU) in the US works against a part of a Zika viral protein, called DIII, that plays a key role for the virus to infect people.

‚ÄúAll flaviviruses have the envelope protein on the outside part of the virus. It has three domains,‚Äù said Qiang Chen, a scientist at ASU.

‚ÄúThe domain III has a unique stretch of DNA for the Zika virus, and we exploited this to generate a robust and protective immune response that is unique for Zika,‚Äù said Chen, who led the research published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The researchers first grew the envelope protein in bacteria, then prepared the DIII protein domain in tobacco plants.

The team then performed immunisation experiments in mice, which induced antibody and cellular immune responses that have been shown to confer 100 per cent protection against multiple Zika virus strains in mice. The team‚Äôs protein-based vaccine uses the smallest and most unique part of the Zika virus that can still elicit a potent and robust immune response.

‚ÄúIn our approach, we make what we call a pseudovirus. It is a fake virus. The pseudovirus displays only the DIII part of the envelope protein on the surface,‚Äù said Chen.

‚ÄúWe did a test to make sure that the vaccine produces a potent protective immune response, but also, that it does not produce antibodies that may be cross reactive for dengue, West Nile, yellow fever or others,‚Äù he said.

The worldwide Zika threat first emerged in 2015, infecting millions as it swept across the Americas. It struck great fear in pregnant women, as babies born with severe brain birth defects quickly overburdened hospitals and public health care systems.

"Alastair Cook attains sixth rank, highest in three years","Alastair Cook scored 243 in first test against West Indies. (Source: Reuters) Alastair Cook scored 243 in first test against West Indies. (Source: Reuters)

After scoring a magnificent double-hundred against West Indies in day-night Test match at Edgbaston, former England captain got a perfect reward for his efforts as he climbed to 6th spot in MRF Tyres ICC Player rankings for Test batsmen. Cook gathered six points following his record 243 against Caribbean team.

This is Cook‚Äôs highest ranking since he surged to number five in March 2013.

England captain Joe Root has returned to the 900-point mark following his 13th career century. For scoring 136, Root received 14 points, which has taken him to 905 points ‚Äì 36 behind Australia captain Steve Smith, who will defend his number-one ranking in the upcoming two-Test series against Bangladesh.

Hosts England rode on a brilliant partnership between Root and Cook to score 514/8 (d) in first innings during England‚Äôs first ever Test match. The rain interrupted the match on a number of occasions but it didn‚Äôt effect the result as the Englishmen wrapped the match within three days.

Claiming a total of 19 wickets in one single day, England bowlers ripped apart West Indies batting line up at Edgbaston. Beginning their first innings from 44/1, West Indies had a horrifying start of the day as they lost Kyle Hope and Powell early in the day.

England‚Äôs quicker bowlers kept troubling the Windies batsmen and wrapped the first innings for 168 to eventually enforce a follow-on. The fortunes didn‚Äôt change for West Indies in the second innings either and they lost wickets at regular intervals only to get bowled out for 137. This was England‚Äôs first ever day-night Test and they stamped authority after winning the clash by an innings and 209 runs

South Korea begin computer-simulated drills amid North Korea tensions,"US Army soldiers move during the annual US South Korea Ulchi-Freedom Guardian military exercises in Paju in 2016. (Source: AP) US Army soldiers move during the annual US South Korea Ulchi-Freedom Guardian military exercises in Paju in 2016. (Source: AP)

South Korean and U.S. forces began computer-simulated military exercises on Monday amid tensions over North Korea‚Äôs missile and nuclear programmes, amid reports that Pyongyang has generated at least $270 million since February despite U.N. sanctions. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the joint drills, called Ulchi Freedom Guardian, were purely defensive and did not aim to raise tensions on the peninsula.

‚ÄúThere is no intent at all to heighten military tension on the Korean peninsula as these drills are held annually and are of a defensive nature,‚Äù Moon told Cabinet ministers. ‚ÄúNorth Korea should not exaggerate our efforts to keep peace nor should they engage in provocations that would worsen the situation, using (the exercise) as an excuse,‚Äù he said.

The joint U.S.-South Korean drills will continue to Aug. 31 and involve computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea. The United States also describes them as ‚Äúdefensive in nature‚Äù, a term North Korean state media has dismissed as a ‚Äúdeceptive mask‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs to prepare if something big were to occur and we needed to protect ROK,‚Äù said Michelle Thomas, a U.S. military spokeswoman, referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea.

North Korea views such exercises as preparations for invasion and has fired missiles and taken other actions to coincide with the military drills in the past. North and South Korea are technically still at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. North Korea‚Äôs rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons and missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland has fuelled a surge in regional tension and U.N.-led sanctions appear to have failed to bite deeply enough to change Pyongyang‚Äôs mind.

SANCTIONS UNDERMINED

Japan‚Äôs Kyodo news agency reported on Monday that a confidential United Nations report found North Korea had continued to evade U.N. sanctions by ‚Äúdeliberately using indirect channels‚Äù and had generated $270 million in banned exports since February. The ‚Äúlax enforcement‚Äù of existing sanctions and Pyongyang‚Äôs ‚Äúevolving evasion techniques‚Äù were undermining the United Nation‚Äôs goal of getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, Kyodo quoted the report as saying.

The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Aug. 5 that could slash the North‚Äôs $3 billion annual export revenue by a third. The latest sanctions were imposed after North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that North Korea will face ‚Äúfire and fury‚Äù if it threatens the United States. The North responded by threatening to fire missiles towards the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam, but later said it was holding off on a decision while it waited to see what the United States would do next.

There will be no field training during the current exercise, according to U.S. Forces Korea. The United States has about 28,000 troops in South Korea. About 17,500 U.S. service members are participating in the exercise this month, down from 25,000 last year, according to the Pentagon. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday the reduction in the number of U.S. troops taking part reflected a need for fewer personnel and was not because of tensions with Pyongyang. Other South Korean allies are also joining this year, with troops from Australia, Britain, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New Zealand taking part.

China, North Korea‚Äôs main ally and trading partner, has urged the United States and South Korea to scrap the drills. Russia has also asked for the drills to stop but the United States has not backed down.

Last week, BJP president Amit Shah had stated during his Madhya Pradesh visit that there was no rule or tradition in his party that those above 75 do not get a post or election ticket. ‚ÄúThere is a need to change the outlook towards politics. It is not a medium to serve personal agenda, it is a medium to serve the society and country,‚Äù Mahajan said, speaking to reporters here.

‚ÄúAge is irrelevant if the person is mentally and physically fit,‚Äù she said.

When asked if she would stand for election in 2019, Mahajan said she was working with full vigour to serve people and working more than an ordinary MP. However, she clarified that she could not say how her physical condition would be after two years.

‚ÄúI will decide after two years whether I would be able to remain active (as a politician) as per the voters‚Äô expectations,‚Äù she said.

"Punish officers who framed Col Purohit, say Hindutva outfits","Malegaon blast accused Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit. Malegaon blast accused Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit.

WELCOMING THE Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to grant bail to 2008 Malegaon blasts accused Lt Col Shrikant Purohit, Hindutva outfits Abhinav Bharat and Sanatan Sanstha on Monday sought justice for other ‚ÄúHindus‚Äù, who they alleged, were arrested falsely in the case and demanded action against those who ‚Äúconspired‚Äù to ‚Äúframe‚Äù the likes of Purohit. The Pune-based Abhinav Bharat came under the scanner of investigating agencies in the Malegaon blasts, while the Sanatan Sanstha is under probe after its members were charged with the murder of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar and Leftist leader and anti-superstition activist Govind Pansare.

The blasts in Malegaon, in Nashik district of Maharashtra, in September 2008 had left seven people dead. Besides Purohit, Ajay Rahirkar, Samir Kulkarni, Major Ramesh Upadhyay (retired) ‚Äî all Pune residents and said to be members of the Abhinav Bharat ‚Äî are among 12 accused arrested by the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), which initially probed the case. The NIA later took over the investigation.

Milind Joshirao of Pune, who now heads Abhinav Bharat, said, ‚ÄúWe are happy that Lt Col Purohit has got bail, but justice is not done yet. The legal battle will continue until Purohit and others accused in the case are acquitted of all charges and legal action is initiated against those who framed them.‚Äù

Satyaki Savarkar, son of Himani Savarkar who headed the outfit when its members were arrested for suspected involvement in the blasts, said, ‚ÄúWe respect the court order and hope that all Hindus falsely arrested in the case also get justice.‚Äù Himani, daughter of Gopal Godse, who was a convict in the Mahatma Gandhi murder case, provided legal support to the accused. She died on October 11, 2015. ‚ÄúLt. Col. Purohit is a brave Army officer. It was our duty to support him and his family by all means,‚Äù Satyaki said.

Calling Purohit‚Äôs bail a ‚Äúvictory of truth‚Äù, Sanatan Sanstha said in a statement: ‚ÄúWe have only one demand. The police officers concerned, who had persecuted innocents such as Sadhvi Pradnya Singh, Col Purohit, by hatching a conspiracy against them should be severely punished. The day this happens would be the day of true justice.‚Äù

Trump administration wants to engage India more effectively in Afghanistan: Mike Pence,"US Vice President Mike Pence. (Reuters photo) US Vice President Mike Pence. (Reuters photo)

The Trump administration wants to engage India more effectively in Afghanistan and hold Pakistan accountable for its actions in the region, US Vice President Mike Pence said. His comments came hours after President Donald Trump hit out at Pakistan for providing safe havens to ‚Äúagents of chaos‚Äù that kill Americans in Afghanistan and warned Islamabad that it has ‚Äúmuch to lose‚Äù by harbouring terrorists.

‚ÄúWe want to strengthen the partnership between Afghanistan and India. We want to hold Pakistan more accountable for their actions in the region,‚Äù Pence said. ‚ÄúWhat President Trump announced yesterday was a whole new strategy for South Asia that said, look, we‚Äôre going to provide the resources and the military personnel and the air assets necessary to support the Afghan army‚Äôs efforts to defeat the Taliban,‚Äù the Vice-President told Fox News.

He said the US would destroy terrorist networks that use Afghanistan and portions of Pakistan as safe havens and asked Islamabad to step up and be a more effective partner in confronting the terrorist organizations, some 20 of which harbor in Afghanistan and regions in Pakistan.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to engage India more effectively in Afghanistan,‚Äù Pence said. India has been supporting an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned, broad-based and inclusive process of peace and reconciliation, and advocating the need for a sustained and long-term commitment to Afghanistan by the international community. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll let the Afghan people build their own nation. Our objective there is to advance the security of the United States of America and to support the Afghan national army as they stay in the lead, in the fight,‚Äù said the Vice President.

In an op-ed in USA Today, Pence alleged that Pakistan too often turns a blind eye to the cancer of terrorism and in many cases it has contributed to the growth of terrorist groups. ‚ÄúPakistan, like Afghanistan, is a haven for terrorist activity. Between the two countries, no fewer than 20 US- designated foreign terrorist organizations have haven and conduct operations ‚Äî the highest concentration of any region in the world. Pakistan, which has borne the weight of terrorist attacks in the past, shares with us,‚Äù he wrote.

He said America will not write a blank check for countries that fail to root out the same forces who try every day to kill its people. Pence said that Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with American effort in Afghanistan. It has much more to lose by supporting terrorists, he warned.

‚ÄúThe president has put them on notice,‚Äù he said. Pence said President‚Äôs strategy for South Asia involves a stronger strategic partnership with India ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest democracy and a key security and economic partner. ‚ÄúIndia has made important contributions towards Afghanistan‚Äôs stability and security, and India has also pledged critical support to Afghanistan‚Äôs development needs. Because they directly affect America‚Äôs interests, America will continue to work closely with New Delhi on these issues,‚Äù Pence wrote.

Delhi confidential: Post-victory prayer,"Ahmed Patel Ahmed Patel

Post-Victory Prayer

Was it divine intervention or astute political tactics that led to Ahmed Patel‚Äôs victory in the from Gujarat? Whatever the reasons may be, 43 Congress MLAs from Gujarat flew to Tirupati on Monday for a darshan at the Lord Balaji temple. During their stay in Bengaluru, the MLAs had vowed to visit Tirupati if Patel won the election. They have kept their word. Before flying out to the temple town in Andhra Pradesh, the MLAs were in Delhi to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul. The Gandhis told them to remain united and continue with the same fighting spirit to defeat the BJP in the coming Assembly elections.

Social Media Class

The chief ministers of BJP-ruled states, who arrived for a meeting at the party headquarters on Monday, had been asked to submit, among others, their progress on social media. The CMs had apparently been asked to tweet between 8 am and 9 am and retweet PM Narendra Modi‚Äôs tweets. Every CM has submitted the report on the number of followers on their Twitter handle and Facebook page, as also how many followers each of them has added in the last 100 days. Another category they had to highlight was how many of their tweets were retweeted by Modi.

Credit For Photos

Outgoing Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit created a new wall of photos of the previous High Commissioners and their wives at Pakistan House. The wall, however, has pictures of only seven or eight envoys with their spouses. A hunt is now on in the archives to get more pictures of Basit‚Äôs predecessors.

Anniversary Request

About a dozen MPs and around 50 writers have written to the Centre with a request to celebrate the 125th anniversary of noted Hindi authors Rahul Sankrityayan and Shivpujan Sahay, who was also a Gandhian litterateur. They have asked the Centre to mark the event of the two stalwarts of Hindi literature in the same manner as the UPA government had celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of literary icon Munshi Premchand in 2006. Acting on their missive, Sahitya Akademi, which has been asked by the Culture ministry for its views, has already endorsed the proposal. However, no decision has been taken yet on the proposal even after months, making the enthusiasts anxious.

"8 years before NIA, Karnataka CID probed ‚Äòlove jihad‚Äô, found no specific instance","Shefin Jahan with Hadiya (Akhila). (File) Shefin Jahan with Hadiya (Akhila). (File)

AN NIA investigation, based on a Supreme Court order, of whether an inter-religion marriage involving a Muslim boy and a Hindu girl fits into a pattern of what some call ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù will not be the first attempt by a police agency to find out if ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù is for real. In 2009, the Karnataka police CID was asked by a division bench of Karnataka High Court to look into allegations of ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù in the marriage of an 18-year-old girl, Silja Raj, from Chamarajnagar area of Bengaluru with a 24-year-old youth, Asghar Nazar, from Kannur in Kerala.

In an interim CID report filed in the high court on November 13, 2009, Karnataka‚Äôs then director general of police Ajay Kumar Singh reported that Silja and Asgar‚Äôs marriage did not involve ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù as alleged in court on behalf of Silja‚Äôs father C Selvaraj. ‚ÄúThere seems to be no prima facie evidence of ‚Äòlove jihad‚Äô in the case of Silja Raj of Karnataka‚Äôs Chamarajanagar district marrying Asgar of Kannur district of Kerala. Silja Raj has married Asgar out of her own volition,‚Äù the interim report said.

Based on the report, the court told Silja she was free to go where she wanted. She chose to go with her husband. ‚ÄúThere is no ‚Äòlove jihad‚Äô. I went with him of my own,‚Äù she said, following the high court‚Äôs verdict in November 2009. With the Silja Raj case settled temporarily, the CID police investigated hundreds of inter-religion marriages that had occurred in Karnataka and in a report dated December 31, 2009, stated that ‚Äúthere is no organised attempt by any group of individuals to entice girls/women belonging to Hindu or Christian religions to marry Muslim boys with the aim of converting them to Islam‚Äù.

The high court had intervened after the father of the girl, C Selvaraj, had filed a habeas corpus plea. During the course of the arguments, Silja‚Äôs elopement of August 9, 2009, and subsequent marriage to Asghar was labelled ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù. The court was told that many non-Muslim girls were being lured to convert to Islam through ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù. Sangh Parivar-affiliated groups Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal and Hindu Jagaran Vedike were around that time engaged in a campaign against ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù. Sri Rama Sene leader Pramod Muttalik had launched a ‚ÄúBeti Bachao Andolan‚Äù on the premise that Hindu girls were being forcibly converted to Islam.

The CID tried to obtain reports of specific instances of love jihad in Karnataka from right-wing activists but the outreach evoked little response. ‚ÄúNo one has come out with any specific instance of ‚Äòlove jihad‚Äô that has taken place in the state,‚Äù said the final seven-page report of then DGP (CID) Dr D V Guruprasad. ‚ÄúMany of the girls who have married outside their religion and who could be contacted stated that they were leading a happy life after marriage. They are adults and have got married to persons of other religions fully comprehending the consequences of their action, the most publicised being that of Shilja Raj.‚Äù

The CID investigation looked at details of police investigations in cases of missing girls from a five-year period (2005-09) and found that 149 Hindu girls who had gone missing during that period had married Muslim men and 10 had married Christian men. Also, 38 Muslim girls and 20 Christian girls had married Hindu boys. One Muslim girl reported as missing had married a Christian boy and 11 Christian girls had married Muslim boys, the CID probe found.

Out of 229 cases involving girls who were reported as missing and later found to be in an inter-religion marriage, conversion had occurred only in 63 cases, the CID probe said. The CID found that as many as 21,890 women had gone missing between 2005-2009 with as many as 2,624 untraced. The CID recommended that the issue of human trafficking required more serious attention than issues like ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù.

Based on the CID report, a division bench comprising Justice K L Manjunath and A V Chandrashekhar on November 6, 2013, closed the investigations into ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù initiated through the habeas corpus case. The case was closed after the government‚Äôs advocate in the high court stated that ‚Äúthere are no cases of love jihad‚Äù and that investigations would be carried out if any cases were reported.

"It‚Äôs more difficult to bat at number three than playing as an opener, says Imrul Kayes","Imrul Kayes will play against Australia in upcoming two-match Test series. (Source: AP) Imrul Kayes will play against Australia in upcoming two-match Test series. (Source: AP)

Bangladesh will face Australia in a two-match Test series at home which is scheduled to begin from Sunday. The hosts are looking to make few changes in their batting line up and batsman Imrul Kayes might have to come in at number three position and talking about the same Kayes has said that he needs to adjust as he is more comfortable while playing as an opener than at three.

‚ÄúI think it is more difficult to bat at number three than playing as an opener,‚Äù Imrul told reporters on Tuesday (August 22). ‚ÄúBut I have to adjust with that. I batted at number three in the last Test match I played in Sri Lanka. I have talked with the coach and he told me to bat at number three. I have been batting in the nets keeping that in mind,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúI think the team management has a plan and that‚Äôs why I am at number three. Soumya has done a lot better at the opening position in the last few matches,‚Äù he said.

Kayes did admit that he is more comfortable as an opener but suggested that he would be ready to do whatever his team requires.

‚ÄúI become very impatient to go to the field when I pad up for batting in the dressing room. Eventually, I have to adjust. If you tell Tamim to do similar kind of stuff, he won‚Äôt be able to do that. Once I could not do that, but I have to do it now for the sake of team‚Äôs requirement. I have to do whatever the team wants from me. I feel that I can bat in both positions either in number three or as an opener; I am ready to accept it,‚Äù Kayes told.

Talking about facing new ball, the batsman suggested when you bat at number three, bowlers become cautious and they control their line and length by the time

‚ÄúThere are both benefits and difficulties in facing the new ball. Bowlers don‚Äôt know about the strengths of a batsman, batsmen also don‚Äôt know what the bowlers can do. But when you bat at number three, bowlers become cautious and they control their line and length by the time,‚Äù he said.

Speaking about the choices that Bangladesh selectors now have, he said that it is a positive sign for Bangladesh cricket.

‚ÄúIt is a positive sign. It is really great for Bangladesh cricket to have a healthy competition in the team,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTeam management can pick the best player if there is a competition around. I think it is very good for us and players will perform as well,‚Äù he added.

Though he accepted that he is more comfortable as an opener, Kayes looked confident about facing the Aussie pace attack.

‚ÄúI have been playing international cricket for the last seven to eight years. I have played against South Africa and England as well. They also have the best pace attack. I survived against them, so I don‚Äôt think it will be difficult for me; I think I can play against the Aussie pace attack as well,‚Äù he said.

"Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy first look: Chiranjeevi‚Äôs next promises a visual treat, watch video","Chiranjeevi‚Äôs Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy first look is out Chiranjeevi‚Äôs Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy first look is out

The motion poster and title of Chiranjeevi‚Äôs upcoming film was unveiled on Tuesday to mark the birthday celebration of the Megastar, who turned 62. The poster was unveiled at a big event organised by Chiranjeevi‚Äôs son Ram Charan Teja in Hyderabad. The period film has been titled Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy, which is based on the life of a freedom fighter.

The motion poster shows a rebel army led by Narasimha Reddy‚Äôs lay siege to a fort occupied by British forces. And it promises to be a visual treat for the audience. The film also has a solid star cast, including Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan.

Nayanthara, Kiccha Sundeep, Vijay Sethupathi and Jagapathy Babu are also in the cast of the mega-budget film, which is bankrolled by Ram Charan‚Äôs home production banner Konidela Production Company.

Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman is also on board, and renowned cinematographer Ravi Varman will be handling the camera for the period-drama, which will be helmed by Surender Reddy.

Surender Reddy last year delivered a super hit movie called Dhruva, a remake of Tamil hit Thani Oruvan. The sleekly made cop-thriller had Ram Charan in the titular role.

Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy is the second film that is being bankrolled by Ram Charan. He made his debut as a producer with Khaidi No 150, which marked the comeback of Chiranjeevi after a gap of 10 years.

Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy is a biopic on Rayalaseema freedom fighter Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy. He is considered to be one of the first freedom fighters in India and his first revolt against the British rule came a decade before India‚Äôs first war of independence in 1857. He was captured and publicly hanged in 1847.

The film was launched earlier this month and the filmmakers have plans to release it worldwide in summer 2018.

"Mira Bhayander polls: BJP increases tally to 61, Shiv Sena suffers setback","BJP workers celebrate outside party office at Mira Bhayandar on Monday. (Dilip Kagda) BJP workers celebrate outside party office at Mira Bhayandar on Monday. (Dilip Kagda)

Bagging 61 of the 95 seats in the Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continued its winning streak in local body polls, making large gains in a region once dominated by the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). In a major setback to the Sena, which had hoped to win more than 45 seats, it won only 22 seats.

The NCP, whose prominent local leader Gilbert Mendonca recently moved to the Sena, was decimated, unable to open its account. In the outgoing general body of elected representatives in the municipality, the NCP had 27 corporators. The Congress won 10 seats while two were picked up by Independents.

In 2012, the BJP became the single largest party in the civic body by winning 29 seats. It was followed by NCP with 27 seats. The Congress had won 19 seats, while the Sena won 14 seats. The rest were won by small parties and Independents. While this poll was termed as a close contest between the BJP and the Sena, the Sena proved to be no match for the BJP, which fought in alliance with the Republican Party of India (Athawale) while the Sena, NCP and Congress fought the polls alone.

Kirit Somaiya, BJP MP, said the Sena should accept the bitter truth of its inability to slow down the BJP juggernaut. ‚ÄúBJP sweeps Mira-Bhayander Municipal Election‚Ä¶ Disaster for Shiv Sena‚Ä¶ hope now the Bandra supremo will accept the reality and respect PM Modi CM Fadnavis,‚Äù Somaiya Tweeted. Ashish Shelar, Mumbai BJP chief said: ‚ÄúThe BJP, which promised transparency, has been accepted by the people who gave us full majority. The result exposed the true strength of some parties.‚Äù

The results came as a big setback for the Sena, which was hoping to win between 45 and 54 seats. The Sena had started preparations for the polls months ago with the induction of sitting corporators and leaders from the Congress, NCP and BJP. The Sena had increased its sitting corporators‚Äô tally to more than 30 ahead of the polls. Besides, the Sena had given tickets to 36 non-Marathi candidates in an effort to woo these groups. However, the formula appeared to have failed, though Sena leaders put up a brave face. ‚ÄúIt is true that we could not get the expected seats in the polls. But our tally has improved substantially compared to the 2012 poll results. Of the 22 seats, 15 are from Marathi dominated areas and seven include four Christians, two North Indians and a Gujarati. It means the Marathi people stood behind us in the polls and those from other communities also won the polls on our ticket,‚Äù said Pratap Sarnaik, Sena in-charge of Mira-Bhayander.

‚ÄúThe BJP campaigned on religion and emotive issues to win. It created a divide among communities that is harmful in the long run,‚Äù said Nawab Malik, NCP‚Äôs chief spokesperson. He conceded that multiple defections had affected the NCP‚Äôs strength. Congress managed to win 10 seats including one unopposed seat. Some of the Congress victories came in areas where former Congress legislator Muzaffar Hussain holds considerable influence. His mother Saiyed Noorjahan Nazarhussain, 68, a former deputy mayor, also won. Meanwhile, the Sena said it would complain to the state poll panel against a Jain monk who sought votes for the BJP through a video message. ‚ÄúIt is illegal. We will ask the panel for action,‚Äù said Sarnaik.

Neymar nets twice as PSG thrash Toulouse 6-2,"The result moved PSG to the top of the table on goal difference. (Source: Reuters) The result moved PSG to the top of the table on goal difference. (Source: Reuters)

Paris St Germain‚Äôs record signing Neymar scored twice on his home debut as the 10-man side thrashed Toulouse 6-2 to go top of Ligue 1.

Last season‚Äôs runners-up produced a stunning display as they set out to reap the benefits of securing the services of Brazilian striker Neymar for 222 million euros ($260.92 million).

Neymar, who left Barcelona to join the French side, drew PSG level after Max Gradel had put Toulouse ahead with a volley in the 18th minute.

Adrien Rabiot struck home before an Edinson Cavani penalty made it 3-1 after Marco Verratti was given his marching orders in the 69th minute.

The visitors closed the gap thanks to Christopher Jullien‚Äôs header but there was no stopping PSG as Javier Pastore, Layvin Kurzawa and a second by Neymar completed the rout.

The result moved PSG to the top of the table on goal difference, with champions Monaco and Saint-Etienne also maintaining their 100 percent records with three wins each.

(Source: Reuters) Wayne Rooney gave another display of clever passing and positioning as well as his trademark finishing. (Source: Reuters)

Wayne Rooney scored his 200th Premier League goal in Everton‚Äôs 1-1 draw at Manchester City on Monday and gave another display which showed his career is far from over.

Rooney‚Äôs 35th minute goal looked to have earned Everton a surprise victory at the Etihad Stadium before substitute Raheem Sterling volleyed in an 82nd minute equaliser.

Although he did not end as the match-winning hero, Rooney was able to savour the moment he became just the second player to reach 200 Premier League goals.

Former Newcastle and England striker Alan Shearer, who ended his career with 260 goals, welcomed Rooney to the exclusive club by tweeting: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been lonely in this @premierleague 200 club. Welcome and congratulations @WayneRooney‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt was nice. To do it today in such an important game for us, with tough games coming up, it was a sweet moment and I am sure the red half of Manchester will have enjoyed it as well,‚Äù said Rooney who scored 183 of his goals in the red shirt of United.

Rooney‚Äôs move last month back to the club he has supported since his youth and where he made his professional debut, was questioned by some critics who wondered whether he might have run out of steam.

But the 31-year-old, who scored on his home debut against Stoke City last week, gave another display of clever passing and positioning as well as his trademark finishing.

‚ÄúIt is not bad for someone who is not fit anymore and can‚Äôt get about the pitch! I have always put a shift in for the team and tonight is no different,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe manager has made it clear he wants to play me in the attacking positions. I have done that throughout my career and the thing for me is to play. I didn‚Äôt play as much last year and if you don‚Äôt play you don‚Äôt get that match fitness,‚Äù he said.

Rooney‚Äôs revival in blue has raised the issue of whether he could earn a recall to Gareth Southgate‚Äôs England squad ahead of next month‚Äôs internationals.

‚ÄúI am focusing on Everton. I am sure I will speak to Gareth Southgate over the next few days and we will see what happens,‚Äù said the forward.

World Badminton Championship: A surfeit of superheroes in Glasgow,"Glaswegian Vincent Deighan, a.k.a. Frank Quitely, has sketched superheroes such as Batman and Superman. Glaswegian Vincent Deighan, a.k.a. Frank Quitely, has sketched superheroes such as Batman and Superman.

When Super Dan flew into Glasgow in pursuit of his half-dozenth World Championship title, the original Superman was zooming over the Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery. The civil reception for players and officials by the Glasgow City Council and BWF ‚Äì hosted at the iconic red matte fa√ßade ‚Äî coincided with The Art of Comics exhibition hosted by the gallery to honour local sketch artist Frank Quitely.

The 49-year-old Glaswegian ‚Äî born Vincent Deighan, and taking off on ‚ÄòFrank Quietly‚Äô, his cheeky alter ego ‚Äî has sketched Superman, Batman, X-Men and Jupiter‚Äôs Legacy in recent years, and the city devoted an entire six months to displaying his largest collection of artwork, while also doffing a hat to other comic legend writers like Mark Millar and Neal Adams.

Superman acquires the subtle Scottish square jaw when he hovers over Kelvingrove, penciled by Frank Quitely. The definitive strokes of a comic sketch more than made up for the gloom that had descended on the Kelvingrove when its piece de resistance, the Christ of Saint John of the Cross ‚Äì a Salvador Dali classic which needs more rumination to breathe it in than mere seeing ‚Äì was taken to London on one of its promised rotations. It‚Äôll move to Florida next, and Glasgow needed Frank Quitely‚Äôs stick strokes to brighten things up a little.

While Glasgow‚Äôs favourite building boasts some Dutch Old Masters, French Impressionists and the best of Scottish art ‚Äì including that of design icon Charles Rennis Mackintosh ‚Äì it‚Äôs the contemporary art exhibitions that the Kelvingrove staff get excited putting together. AC/DC and the Glasgow Boys were mega hits, while ‚ÄòCostumes of Kylie Minogue‚Äô drew a surprisingly large crowd few years back ‚Äî with the common refrain about how petite she was.

Badminton may not be the biggest sport this corner of the planet, but gallery staff were keen to take a shot at compiling shuttle‚Äôs best artefacts.

Scotland‚Äôs best sketched boy who never grew up is Peter Pan. Over this next week, we‚Äôll know if there‚Äôs an ageless Chinese reincarnate of JM Barrie‚Äôs best creation, and if he goes by the name Lin Dan.

"Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency is over, says Steve Bannon","US President Donald Trump talks to chief strategist Steve Bannon during a swearing in ceremony for senior staff at the White House in Washington, US January 22, 2017. (REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File photo) US President Donald Trump talks to chief strategist Steve Bannon during a swearing in ceremony for senior staff at the White House in Washington, US January 22, 2017. (REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File photo)

Ousted White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon on Saturday said the Trump presidency that the right-wing conservatives helped make a reality is ‚Äúover‚Äù and the president would now be ‚Äúmoderated‚Äù by the Republicans. Bannon, who headed the controversial right-wing website ‚ÄòBreitbart News‚Äô before joining the Trump administration, also denied that he was fired from the key position.

Hours after he left the White House, 63-year-old Bannon returned to Breitbart News as its executive chairman and also chaired the company‚Äôs evening editorial meeting yesterday. ‚ÄúThe Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,‚Äù he told the conservative outlet Weekly Standard. ‚ÄúWe still have a huge movement, and we will make something of this Trump presidency. But that presidency is over. It‚Äôll be something else. And there‚Äôll be all kinds of fights, and there‚Äôll be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over,‚Äù said Bannon, who is generally perceived as the driving force behind Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúnationalist‚Äù ideology.

Bannon says that his departure was voluntary, and that he had planned it to coincide with the one-year anniversary of his joining the Trump campaign as chief executive, on August 14, 2016. ‚ÄúOn August 7, I talked to [Chief of Staff John] Kelly and to the President, and I told them that my resignation would be effective the following Monday, on 14th,‚Äù he said.

The former White House chief strategist said that the fight is just the beginning. ‚ÄúI feel jacked up. Now I‚Äôm free. I‚Äôve got my hands back on my weapons. Someone said, ‚Äòit‚Äôs Bannon the Barbarian.‚Äô I am definitely going to crush the opposition. There‚Äôs no doubt‚Ä¶‚Äù he said.

Bannon predicted that Trump would now be moderated by the Republicans. ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre going to try to moderate him.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think that‚Ä¶his (Trump‚Äôs) actual default position is the position of his base, the position that got him elected. I think you‚Äôre going to see a lot of constraints on that. It will be much more conventional,‚Äù Bannon said.

Buoyed by Bannon‚Äôs return, Breitbart News CEO and President Larry Solov said: ‚ÄúBreitbart‚Äôs pace of global expansion will only accelerate with Steve back. The sky‚Äôs the limit.‚Äù Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow said, ‚Äúthe populist-nationalist movement got a lot stronger today and the magazine gained an executive chairman with his finger on the pulse of the Trump agenda.‚Äù

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in a brief statement did not explain the reasons for Bannon‚Äôs departure. ‚ÄúWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve‚Äôs last day. We are grateful for his service and wish him the best,‚Äù Sanders said.

Yuvraj Singh‚Äôs absence from the India squad named for the Sri Lanka limited overs series created quite a flutter and raised many eyebrows. There were reports doing the rounds following the decision that the reason for him not being included for the five match ODI series and a one-off T20I was the poor fitness level displayed at the National Cricket Academy (NCA).

The official reason stated for Yuvraj‚Äôs absence was given as ‚Äòrest‚Äô but Gautam Gambhir believes that wasn‚Äôt the right word used for the case. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think ‚Äòrest‚Äô is the right word because he (Yuvraj) hasn‚Äôt played any cricket for quite a while and he would be wanting to play. If you want to see him at the World Cup, he should be given the maximum opportunity. Because, someone like Yuvraj, you want him in that flow, you want him in that rhythm. You can‚Äôt have someone like him playing in one series and resting thereafter,‚Äù Gambhir told ESPNCricinfo.

Gambhir added that it will be tough for Yuvraj to find a place in the team going forward given the lofty fitness standards set by the team. ‚ÄúSo, I feel that it‚Äôs difficult now for Yuvraj to make a comeback. Hopefully, he does because he is one of the greats of the game,‚Äù Gambhir added.

Meanwhile, chief selector had earlier said Yuvraj had been rested but door was not shut on him in hopes of finding a spot in the 2019 World Cup squad. ‚ÄúYuvraj has been rested,‚Äù said MSK Prasad, adding that ‚Äúdoors are never closed on anybody‚Äù.

The critical fitness test which Yuvraj failed is called as the Yo-Yo test or an advanced version of the beep test from the past. ‚ÄúThe current team think tank, coach Ravi Shastri, skipper Virat Kohli and chairman of selectors MSK Prasad have made it clear that fitness standards are non-negotiable,‚Äù said a BCCI official.

‚ÄúOn an average, the Australian cricketers score 21 in Yo-Yo test. Here Virat (Kohli), Ravindra Jadeja, Manish Pandey regularly hit that score while others are either touching 19.5 or is hitting above that score,‚Äù the official added.

The rupee advanced by 8 paise to 64.06 against the US dollar in early session today on increased selling of the US currency by exporters and banks. Besides, the dollar‚Äôs weakness against major currencies overseas and a higher opening in domestic stocks kept the domestic unit in good spirit, forex dealers said.

Yesterday, the rupee had ended marginally higher at 64.14 against the US currency due to some dollar demand from importers and corporates. Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex rebounded by 218.19 points, or 0.70 per cent, to 31,477.04 in early trade.

After three people tackled the assignment with limited success, the job of keeping President Donald Trump on message has for now fallen to Hope Hicks, a young former public relations aide and political neophyte who entered his orbit not knowing the ride would eventually take her into the cutthroat world of Washington politics.

Word of Hicks‚Äô promotion _ she already was director of ‚Äústrategic‚Äù communications at the White House _ landed this week just as she and other top Trump aides confronted one of the biggest communications challenges in recent memory.

After Trump went off message and blamed ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù for deadly violence between white supremacists and counter-protesters at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, blowback was sharp and swift. Members of Congress in both parties urged a defiant president to more forcefully denounce the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who marched through the college town. Other lawmakers openly questioned the president‚Äôs competence and moral leadership. Business leaders whom Trump, a businessman himself, enjoyed inviting to the White House fled the advisory boards they had agreed to serve on, while leaders of the armed services denounced racism and hatred without naming their commander in chief.

Repairing the breach, or at least keeping it from growing, is among the most immediate tasks facing the 28-year-old native of Greenwich, Connecticut. She succeeds Anthony Scaramucci, another flamboyant New York businessman, whose 11-day tenure as White House communications director ended after an expletive-filled tirade to a reporter about his new office mates.

‚ÄúHope is a terrific person and will do a great job. Wishing her the best,‚Äù Scaramucci tweeted after the White House announced Hicks‚Äô promotion. She will help shape and steer White House messaging until someone who wants the assignment permanently _ who would be the fifth person in less than a year _ comes aboard.

Those who have worked with the shy, former teen model describe her as trustworthy.

‚ÄúHope is wise beyond her years and is someone I trust to always be there for the president,‚Äù said Brad Parscale, the digital director of Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign who, like Hicks, was one of Trump‚Äôs few original campaign members. ‚ÄúI have been disappointed in seeing so many use President Trump as an opportunity to maximize their own self-interest.‚Äù

Hicks avoids the spotlight, unlike colleagues who got under Trump‚Äôs skin by letting their profiles rise.

Hick has long served as a gatekeeper to Trump and now plays the role from her desk near the Oval Office. As was the arrangement during the campaign, media requests to interview the president go through Hicks, and she was the only aide in the Oval Office when Trump sharply criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a recent New York Times interview. She does not do television appearances.

Parscale said Hicks is dedicated to Trump‚Äôs broader aims.

‚ÄúHis campaign was about millions of Americans across this country who have been left behind,‚Äù Parscale said, adding that Hicks understands that and ‚Äútruly wants to see President Trump succeed.‚Äù

A former Ralph Lauren fashion model and public relations pro who worked for Trump‚Äôs daughter Ivanka, Hicks had no political background when she signed on for the celebrity businessman‚Äôs fledgling campaign in 2015. Soon, she essentially became a one-woman communications shop for an unconventional campaign that attracted unprecedented media attention.

She approved interview requests, often tapped out tweets he dictated and remained at his side as he barnstormed the country.

Hicks followed her parents, Paul and Caye Hicks, public relations professionals, into the business. After graduating in 2010 from Southern Methodist University with a degree in English, she moved to New York and worked with Hiltzik Strategies, which has also worked for Hillary Clinton _ as did her father. Paul Hicks used to do communications for the NFL, and is now managing partner at a firm in Washington. In 2014, Hicks joined the Trump Organization to help promote Ivanka‚Äôs merchandise. A year later, Trump brought her onto the campaign.

She attracted considerable media attention on her own, but largely eschewed face-to-face interactions with reporters, and almost never joined them for off-the-record socializing. Her interactions were almost always limited to the phone and email.

Don‚Äôt look for Hicks to try to curb Trump‚Äôs tweeting, as others have urged him to do.

‚ÄúYou can own the news cycle with one tweet and I think that speaks to both the power of his presence and personality, but also his message, and his ability to captivate,‚Äù she said in a brief video for Forbes magazine‚Äôs ‚Äú30 Under 30‚Äù series. Hicks is not on Twitter.

In Mobile, Alabama, during the transition, Trump cajoled her to say a few words to tens of thousands of supporters who turned out for a ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù rally after the election.

‚ÄúWhere is Hope? Where is Hope? Hope, get up here, Hope. Hope, get up here,‚Äù Trump said.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs always on the phone talking to the reporters, trying to get the reporters to straighten out their dishonest stories,‚Äù Trump said, adding that Hicks is a ‚Äútremendously talented person.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a little shy, but that‚Äôs OK because she is really, really talented,‚Äù Trump added, before beseeching her to ‚Äúsay a couple of words.‚Äù

Hicks said nine. ‚ÄúHi. Merry Christmas everyone, and thank you, Donald Trump.‚Äù

American distance runner Shalane Flanagan gets silver medal from 2008 Olympics,"The USOC and USA Track and Field said Shalane Flanagan, received her silver medal at her home in Portland, Oregon, earlier on Monday.

Distance runner Shalane Flanagan received her 2008 Olympic silver medal on Monday after the Turkish runner who finished ahead of her tested positive for a performance enhancing drug, the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Track & Field said.

Flanagan was the bronze medallist in the 10,000 metres at the Beijing Games until second-placed finisher Elvan Abeylegesse was disqualified in March after a re-test of a 2007 sample showed positive for the banned steroid stanozolol.

The USOC and USA Track & Field said Flanagan, who preferred not to have an official ceremony, received her silver medal at her home in Portland, Oregon, earlier on Monday.

‚ÄúReceiving my proper medal and having the record books changed is a dream come true,‚Äù Flanagan, said in a statement. ‚ÄúI greatly appreciate the USOC‚Äôs efforts to host a more formal medal ceremony in my honor, but with my coach and my family, I have decided to forego that option and instead celebrate in private.

‚ÄúThis news, and receiving my medal, are all that I need to feel incredibly fulfilled and happy.‚Äù The 2008 bronze medal previously owned by Flanagan, 36, has been returned to the IOC.

Decoded: Why expensive wines taste better,"It all has to do with the price tag! (Source: Thinkstock Images) It all has to do with the price tag! (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Expensive wines appear to be tastier, say scientists who have found that a higher price tag on the bottle causes the reward centre in the brain to trick the taste processing regions.

The phenomenon that identical products are perceived differently due to differences in price is called the ‚Äúmarketing placebo effect.‚Äù

As with placebo medications, it has an effect solely due to ascribed properties: ‚ÄúQuality has its price!‚Äù

‚ÄúHowever, it has so far been unclear how the price information ultimately causes more expensive wine to also be perceived as having a better taste in the brain,‚Äù said Bernd Weber, from the University of Bonn in Germany.

The researchers assessed how different prices are translated into corresponding taste experiences in the brain, even if the wine tasted does not differ.

Thirty participants took part in the study, of which 15 were women and 15 were men, with an average age of around 30 years.

The wine tasting took place lying down in an MRI scanner, allowing brain activity to be recorded ‚Äúonline‚Äù while participants were tasting the wines. Each time, the price of the wine was shown first.

Only then around a millilitre of the respective wine was given to the participants via a tube in their mouths. The participants were then asked to rate via a button on a nine-point scale how good the wine tasted to them.

Their mouths were then rinsed with a neutral liquid and the next identical wine sample was given for tasting.

Researchers conducted the tests using an average to good quality red wine with a retail bottle prize of 12 euros.

In the MRI scanner, the price of this wine was shown randomly as 3, 6 and 18 euros.

‚ÄúAs expected, the subjects stated that the wine with the higher price tasted better than an apparently cheaper one,‚Äù said Hilke Plassmann from the INSEAD Business School in France.

Identical wine leads to a better taste experience when a greater quality expectation is associated with the wine due to its price.

The measurements of brain activity in the MRI scanner confirmed this. The research team discovered that above all parts of the medial pre-frontal cortex and also the ventral striatum were activated more when prices were higher.

While the medial pre-frontal cortex particularly appears to be involved in integrating the price comparison and thus the expectation into the evaluation of the wine, the ventral striatum forms part of the brain‚Äôs reward and motivation system.

‚ÄúThe reward and motivation system is activated more significantly with higher prices and apparently increases the taste experience in this way,‚Äù said Weber.

‚ÄúUltimately, the reward and motivation system plays a trick on us,‚Äù said INSEAD post-doctoral fellow Liane Schmidt.

When prices are higher, it leads us to believe that a taste is present that is not only driven by the wine itself, because the products were objectively identical in all of the tastings.

(Source: Express Archive)

ISL franchise NorthEast United FC owner John Abraham on Sunday said his team will break-even within next one or two seasons and will become the first one among all the teams.

‚ÄúNEUFC will be the first team in ISL to break-even. This is the fourth season of ISL and we will break-even in fifth or sixth season. So, it is just one or two more seasons,‚Äù Abraham said at a press conference in Guwahati.

Most of the ISL teams are targetting to break-even in the seventh or eighth season, he claimed.

‚ÄúWithin the ISL, when someone talks about template, then they say look at NEUFC. We are working on economy of scale. We are working at the grass root and with local boys. We also prefer local sponsors,‚Äù the Bollywood star said.

He further informed that NEUFC is also very reasonable in terms of pricing of tickets during the matches and highly appreciated the support of the government machinery.

‚ÄúWe have a long-term vision. We are here for very very long term. We have already tied up with two clubs in Shillong and in Manipur. We have shortlisted kids and will house them

in a residential academy at Shillong, where all their needs, including education will be taken care of,‚Äù Abraham said.

A third partnership is in the offing with a club in Mizoram, he added without sharing the name.

‚ÄúI am also the brand ambassador of Arunachal Pradesh. Very soon something very very exciting coming up there. It is about football. NEUFC is not just a club. It is a platform to

reiterate the voice of North East,‚Äù the actor said.

NEUFC has conducted scouting across Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Manipur and selected 48 kids for trainig them at the residential academy.

Asked about merger of I-League and ISL, Abraham said it does not look possible at present, but a has to be taken by the higher management.

The ISL franchise owner also said he is reaching out to all the North Eastern state governments to tie up for encouraging tourism in the region.

Talking about Indian football, Abraham said: ‚ÄúIndian football still has to develop. Foreign players are coming up and it is exciting for Indian players. Infrastructure has to be developed. If you ask me, football is not cricket yet, but it will be new cricket in a period of time.‚Äù

Maharashtra Prisons dept sends photos of Vijay Mallya‚Äôs likely barrack to British authorities,"The official added that they could seek the permission from the court to produce Mallya through video-conferencing. (File) The official added that they could seek the permission from the court to produce Mallya through video-conferencing. (File)

IN ORDER to satisfy British authorities, the Maharashtra Prisons department attached photographs of the barrack at Mumbai‚Äôs Arthur Road jail where wanted liquor baron Vijay Mallya could be lodged if extradited to India to face prosecution in the alleged Rs 900 crore loan default case. The Prison authority also suggested that it would be more than happy to host a delegation from the Britain Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) if they wanted to pay a visit to the Arthur Road jail.

‚ÄúThe delegation could inspect for themselves the conditions of the Indian jails and satisfy if it meets the security and other requirements as per the extradition treaty in the event Mallya is sent back to India,‚Äù revealed a senior Home Department official. The CPS presented the case in a London court on behalf of the Indian authorities. Last month, the State Home Department had received a query from its counterpart in the Central Government on the contention raised by Mallya in his application against his extradition. In his plea, Mallya had raised the ‚Äúpoor conditions‚Äù of Indian prisons as one of the grounds. The reply has been sent to the Central Government. His extradition plea is being heard in London‚Äôs Westminster Court.

‚ÄúWe had also attached over a dozen of photographs of the cell, along with the details of the barrack number 12 at the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai where he could be lodged.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere are four cells which are still unoccupied in the barrack and are meant for VIP prisoners. In our reply, we have stated that one of these cells could house Mallya. The cells are spacious with a few facilities and would meet the condition laid down in the treaty,‚Äù explained a senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ‚ÄùIn our reply, we have stated that lodging Mallya won‚Äôt be a problem. There are cells in Arthur Road that have been built for housing high-profile prisoners. Other than Arthur Road jail, Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai is also very well equipped to lodge a special prisoner and could meet with the conditions raised in the treaty,‚Äù said an official who didn‚Äôt wish to be named.

The Maharashtra government had built a bomb-proof barrack inside Arthur Road jail to house 26/11 convict Ajmal Kasab. After Kasab was executed, the barrack now houses another 26/11 alleged mastermind Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Jundal. Sources add that the said barrack is reserved for criminals facing terror charges and those who have threat perception and could also pose as a threat to the jail. It‚Äôs highly unluckily that Mallya would be housed in Kasab‚Äôs barrack. ‚ÄúWe have other cells which are equally secured,‚Äù added the official while speaking on the issue of security.

A senior official from the Prisons Department also told The Indian Express that even before receiving a query from the Centre, a detailed discussion on Mallya took place a few months ago when the reports of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) seeking Mallya‚Äôs extradition first surfaced. A source said that while lodging a prisoner who is being brought through an extradition treaty, the conditions of the extradition cannot be breached. This includes how and where the accused should be lodged.

‚ÄúThis is not the first time that we are dealing with prisoners who have been extradited and lodged in our prisons. In their cases, we have met all the conditions listed in the treaty. Similarly, in the case of Mallya, we had discussed all that would be required to be done in the eventuality of him being brought to India,‚Äù said an official. According to sources, senior officials also inspected barrack number 12 at the Arthur Road jail to see the conditions of the cells. ‚ÄúThe treaty would require us to have barrack with particular size specifications. Cell number 12 on Arthur Road would be able to meet with such specifications. As far as providing facilities goes, those would be under the realm of the treaty agreed upon by the two parties,‚Äù added the official.

The official added that they could seek the permission from the court to produce Mallya through video-conferencing. ‚ÄúThe agencies could always ask the court to produce Mallya through video-conferencing. This will ensure that he is secured and we don‚Äôt have to press additional manpower in ferrying him to courts,‚Äù added the official.

Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) have availed the services of former India left-arm spinner Sunil Joshi for their upcoming series against Australia with the first Test starting on Sunday. Joshi would help the Bangladesh team as a spin bowling consultant. Joshi will be flying out to Dhaka soon to join up with the side in their quest to beat Australia in the two-Test series.

‚ÄúI am just going to Bangladesh for two Test matches. I will be helping them out with the spin department,‚Äù said Joshi to The Hindu, who played 15 Tests and 69 ODIs for India.

The prospect of Joshi aiding the Bangladesh spinners would become additionally interesting given Australia have brought in S. Sriram to aid their spinners.

The development was confirmed by a BCB official who said, ‚ÄúHe (Joshi) is expected to arrive in Dhaka soon and the preparations will begin for the first Test. Bangladesh has been looking for a spin consultant for a while and Mr Joshi will help strengthen our support staff.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe has currently been hired for the two-match series against Australia and a decision on future assignments will be taken after a meeting with the BCB members,‚Äù the official was quoted as saying by CricketNext.

Bangladesh had been on the look out for a spin bowling consultant following Australian leggie Stuart McGill‚Äôs decision to turn down the position due to illness.

State of the Union,"Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran. Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran.

The flaws in India‚Äôs internal security management and how it impacts our image in international fora

Title: Keeping India Safe: The Dilemma of Internal Security

Author: Vappala Balachandran

Publisher: Harper Collins

Pages: 328 pages

Price: Rs 599

Internal security provides the foundation for external security and our prestige in international fora. If there are a hundred points of insurgency, disaffection or rebellion, those weaken the social structure and hamper economic growth, and news about these unrests affects other countries‚Äô judgement about our handling of sensitive matters. Unfortunately, our policy makers have not paid adequate attention to this vital sector and their threat responses have been influenced more by political considerations than strategic vision. Much was expected of the NDA government, but unfortunately, it has also disappointed ‚Äî so far, at least.

Balachandran‚Äôs book on internal security is a valuable addition to the literature on the subject. He has drawn our attention to fundamental flaws in the Constitution which are adversely affecting our handling of internal security challenges. The founding fathers, as he says, copied the Act of 1935 while dividing Centre-state subjects without considering whether it would safeguard national integrity in times of turbulence. They should have given concurrent responsibility to the Centre to deal with national security threats, and not doing so was ‚Äúcertainly a lapse‚Äù. This view is supported by leading Constitutional experts like Fali Nariman. Not that the government is unaware of it, but it fears opposition from states. The reality has to be faced, and the sooner we do it the better.

Balachandran is on target when he says that after 26/11, the nation was united against the scourge of terrorism, and that it was an ideal opportunity to amend the Constitution and create a federal police which would investigate terror and other cases which had all-India ramifications. ‚ÄúWhat was however produced was a partly empowered police (the NIA)‚Äù. It was a ‚Äúleadership failure‚Äù of the UPA government.

The author also writes of institutions which are either dysfunctional or have no statutory basis. The National Security Council, which should have played a key role, is one of these, thanks to its unclear charter. The National Security Advisory Board is a collection of the best brains in the field of security, but the government has not made use of this vast reservoir of talent. What is worse, the organisation became defunct under the NDA regime, though lately, it has been revived in an emaciated form. The Crisis Management Group could never rise to the occasion, whether in the assassination of Mrs Indira Gandhi or the hijacking of IC-814 or the 26/11 attack. The Intelligence Bureau should have an oversight mechanism and be made accountable. The CBI also requires a legal mandate and greater autonomy in personnel and finance. The Ministry of Home Affairs has become unwieldy and needs to be bifurcated, with a separate division for internal security alone. All these are valuable points and need to be acted upon at the highest level.

The most interesting chapter deals with 26/11. It clearly brings out that the Centre had not passed on any specific intelligence to the State, that the police had reacted promptly with their available resources, and that there was no serious lapse. But the state government could have tightened coastal surveillance and made provisions for equipment and arms easier for the police. The political leadership and bureaucracy were to blame for that. Were they held accountable? Why the Centre didn‚Äôt institute an inquiry into the lapses of 26/11 remains a mystery to this day. According to knowledgeable people, the inquiry was not set up because several senior officers in Delhi would have been found guilty.

The NDA government, according to the author, has shown ‚Äúno interest in revising the stagnant thinking on national security‚Äù. The indictment is a bit harsh. The government has taken some initiatives to improve the police and tackle Maoists, but these efforts have not been as comprehensive as was required. The author has also faulted the NDA government for ‚Äúimmaturely‚Äù dealing with the Naga problem. The brain behind the framework agreement with the NSCN (IM) was of one of the finest officers of the country. If the framework could not be given a final shape, it is essentially because of the duplicity of the Naga leaders.

The book is full of facts and figures on foreign security agencies. Researchers would find these useful. But William Henry Sleeman has been given more space than he deserved. The detailed accounts of thuggee are, nevertheless, interesting.

"Triple talaq invalid: Who are the petitioners, what are their arguments?","Triple talaq verdict: At her parents‚Äô home in Kashipur, Shayara Bano hasn‚Äôt met her two children since she left Allahabad last April. (Express Photo/Ravi Kanojia/File) Triple talaq verdict: At her parents‚Äô home in Kashipur, Shayara Bano hasn‚Äôt met her two children since she left Allahabad last April. (Express Photo/Ravi Kanojia/File)

In a much awaited verdict, the Supreme Court on Monday invalidated the practice of instant triple talaq or divorce in Muslims. A five-judge bench began hearing a batch of petitions by women back in May, who argued that the practice was ‚Äúunlawful and unconstitutional‚Äù. The bench, headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar, includes Justices Kurian Joseph, R F Natiman, U U Lalit and S Abdul Nazeer. Each of them are from different religious communities ‚Äî Sikh Christian, Parsi, Hindu and Muslim.

Who are the petitioners?

Shayara Bano

There are six petitioners in the case. The main plea in the case was filed by Shayara Bano, a 36-year-old whose husband of 15 years divorced her by pronouncing triple talaq. Bano, who is battling multiple ailments following several abortions, received a talaqnama (divorce) by post while she was staying with her parents in Kashipur, Uttarakhand.

In her petition, Bano argued that ‚Äúthe Muslim husband‚Äôs right to ask for divorce by uttering talaq three times in a row is completely unilateral, unguided, absolute and has no rationale. It cannot be identified with Muslim culture and is not part of Muslim law. So it is not part of religion and hence not part of the right to practice or propagate religion and deserves no protection.‚Äù Read: Shayara Banu‚Äôs fight against triple talaq

Ishrat Jahan

Thirty-year-old Ishrat Jahan‚Äôs husband uttered talaq three times over the phone and allegedly took away her four children. She was left at the mercy of her extended family in Howrah.

Jahan‚Äôs lawyer V K Biju said ahead of the court verdict: ‚ÄúI did ask her to come, I do not know if she will be able to. She has been unreachable for some time. She lost her four children and her husband divorced her over phone. She fought back to prevent his second marriage. She was attacked and landed in the Calcutta Medical College.‚Äù

BMMA

A third petition, titled ‚ÄòMuslim Women‚Äôs Quest for Equality‚Äô, was filed by the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA). In court, BMMA argued that Allah says men and women are equal. ‚ÄúWe have reproduced verses from the Quran about talaq, negotiations and how it should happen over a minimum period of 90 days. The second argument is about gender justice. There is no ambiguity in the Constitution of India about all citizens having equal rights.‚Äù

Gulshan Parween, Aafreen Rehman, and Atiya Sabri

Gulshan Parween and Aafreen Rehman are two other petitioners in the case. Ahead of the verdict, their lawyers said they were unable to contact the women but insisted that they would be present in court on the ‚Äúbig day‚Äù. Parween is from Rampur while Rehman is from Jaipur. Atiya Sabri, a resident of Saharanpur, is the last petitioner in the case.

Meanwhile, senior counsel Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the All India Muslim Personal Law Board argued that court should not interfere in the practice of triple talaq as it‚Äôs a matter of faith. He had equated the issue to the belief that Lord Rama was born in Ayodhya to point out that matters of faith cannot be tested for constitutional morality. He had also said that as Muslims had been practicing triple talaq for at least 1,400 years, it cannot be termed un-Islamic.

Former Union minister Salman Khurshid, who was allowed by the court to assist it as amicus curiae, also contended that instant triple talaq ‚Äúcannot be justified or given legal validity‚Äù. He argued that the practice ‚Äúwas sinful but legal‚Äù.

Making a strong fashion statement with his new colour forecast, Ujjawal Dubey for his label Antar Agni at Lakme Fashion Week Winter/festive 2017 unveiled his ‚ÄòDisobedient‚Äô collection for men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs wear. Ujjawal‚Äôs construction and designing techniques have been his signature that has revolutionised the concept of men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs wear.

Men‚Äôs wear had the characteristic asymmetric silhouettes for waist coats and kurtas.

Asymmetrical, double-breasted coat and dress were simple with machine embroidery; while jumpsuits with side pockets looked comfortable and relaxed. The double-breasted dress with a soft backless coat, grey midi with cowl cover, two-toned kurta, maxi dress with asymmetric cover and rouched back drape proved it was a balanced collection.

DIVYAM MEHTA



When the inspirations for the collection are the draping styles of the Buddhist monks with the multiple layers and interesting waist belts; then the look had to be serene, spiritual and sophisticated.

Women‚Äôs wear was as spiritual in nature with draped front-tied skirt and coat, asymmetric layered dress, an interestingly draped sari, toga-style midi, black sack dress and skirt, kimono cover and draped dress. (Source: Amit Chakravarty/IndianExpress)

MANISH ARORA



Manish Arora‚Äôs Autumn/Winter 2017 collection celebrated his tenth anniversary of showing at Paris Fashion Week that has turned the designer‚Äôs name into a global phenomenon. He presented the glitzy, glamorous, collection called ‚ÄòCosmic Love‚Äô. ""The line I am bringing to Mumbai is inspired by the tribes of Africa and outer reaches of the cosmos. Having spent 10 years of my working life in Paris after launching my career in Delhi, I have drawn much inspiration from my travels to the work I create,"" said Arora of his collection.

The creations were a visual interplay of colours, styles, intricate silhouettes and designs. Taking the audience on a fast-paced fashion journey from Tribal Africa to Aztec prints that reflected Art Deco touches, Manish created geometrics with patchwork and embroidery. Detailing has always been Manish‚Äôs fort√® and the designer unleashed stunning velvet appliqu√©s and optical illusion peacock embellishments in gleaming gold and green.

Astrology played a major role for embroidery, as shooting stars and golden sunrays appeared on silk cr√™pe drawstring dresses and cropped denim jackets. Swarovski crystals looked magnificent for paisleys that were emblazoned on burgundy, tunic dresses or velvet gowns. Colours played a celestial symphony as mustard, tangerine, midnight blue, violet, fuchsia and royal blue turned into the ideal basis for the collection."

A Gentleman song Laagi Na Choote: This Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez song will give you goosebumps,"Sidharth Malhotra makes Jacqueline Fernandez and us go weak in the knees. Sidharth Malhotra makes Jacqueline Fernandez and us go weak in the knees.

Jacqueline Fernandez has been setting the screens on fire with her hot bod, moves and pole dance in her upcoming film A Gentleman. But in the new song from the film, Laagi Na Choote, it is Sidharth Malhotra who will take your breath away.

Girls, be prepared to swoon from the moment Sidharth goes shirtless. The actor looks extremely desirable, and we are not apologetic about swooning over him.

Add to it, Jacqueline and Sidharth‚Äôs chemistry is off the charts in this Sachin-Jigar composition sung by Arijit Singh and Shreya Ghoshal. The song also features a steamy lip-lock which is perhaps the liplock the lead actors were talking about during the press conference of A Gentleman in Mumbai. During the press meet, it was revealed that the directors had to stop the duo as they went on to continue the scene. Well, they do look very much into it, which takes it up a notch in comparison to other scenes we have seen in Bollywood films.

A Gentleman presents Sidharth in a never seen before avatar. Following in the footsteps of his contemporaries Varun Dhawan and Arjun Kapoor, the actor plays a double role for the first time in the Bollywood thriller.

Directed and written by Raj & DK, the film is a Fox Star Studios production, starring Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez. It is set to release on August 25, 2017.

Legends bemoan Windies‚Äô woes as ‚Äúa cricketing tragedy‚Äù,"West Indies were defeated by an innings and 209 runs. (Source: AP) West Indies were defeated by an innings and 209 runs. (Source: AP)

The gradual decline of West Indian cricket is hardly a new phenomenon but the latest capitulation of a once-dominant test match power has brought genuine expressions of sadness throughout the sport.

The defeat by an innings and 209 runs in the first day-night test in England at Edgbaston at the weekend left both Caribbean legends and old international foes alike bemoaning what they saw as Windies cricket crashing to rock bottom.

With a callow visiting team looking helpless in the absence of their best players and losing 19 wickets in one woeful day on Saturday, the overwhelming feeling was summed up by former England captain Michael Vaughan, who worries about yet more humiliation for the visitors.

‚ÄúI really fear that this series could be one of the saddest for Test cricket,‚Äù Vaughan told the BBC, before the second test that starts in Leeds on Friday.

According to another former captain Geoff Boycott in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, there could be no room for English gloating because the Windies surrender at Edgbaston had been so ‚Äúpainful to watch.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis West Indies lot are the worst Test match team I have seen in more than 50 years of watching, playing and commentating on cricket,‚Äù Boycott wrote.

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt bat and can‚Äôt bowl. I take no pleasure out of saying this as I played against some of the greatest players the world has ever seen wearing the maroon cap of the West Indies.

‚ÄúIt is a cricketing tragedy to see the West Indies like this‚Ä¶ It is just sad to see a once-proud cricket Test team lower than any I have ever seen before.‚Äù

The sadness was felt much closer to home, too, with the great Antiguan fast bowler Curtly Ambrose telling the Daily Mail newspaper: ‚ÄúIt does hurt. And it has reached a point where it is very embarrassing.

‚ÄúFor now, I‚Äôm just hoping West Indies can compete at Headingley and Lord‚Äôs (in the third test) because what we have seen so far has been pathetic.‚Äù

INTERNAL PROBLEMS

It is now 17 years since a West Indies side won a test in England and, as Vaughan suggested, ‚Äúevery time they have arrived here, they seem to have got worse.‚Äù

The halcyon days of those thrilling 1980s and early 1990s teams, when Ambrose and his fellow pace demons inspired fear and batting blasters like Viv Richards looked so imperious on English tours, have never felt more like pre-history.

The problems that have beset the sport in the Caribbean for so long were highlighted brutally in the Edgbaston debacle.

The West Indies may be the Twenty20 world champions but the mainstays of that triumph ‚Äì like Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels, Dwayne Bravo and Darren Sammy ‚Äì now play lucrative T20 tournaments around the world rather than representing the West Indies after constant pay disputes with Cricket West Indies.

The world T20 win and the under-19 team‚Äôs world championship victory last year tell of talent and potential that can still be harnessed in the Caribbean game.

Yet at test level, the internal conflicts have led to serial under-performing with the Windies having not won a test series away from home, other than against the ‚Äòminnows‚Äô Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, for 22 years.

Without senior players to guide them, it was the way the young team folded so meekly at Edgbaston that upset Ambrose.

‚ÄúI talked with Sir Viv Richards and Sir Andy Roberts at length before and during the Test about how we used to dominate world cricket, about our pride and passion. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs lacking,‚Äù wrote Ambrose.

‚ÄúWhat concerns me is that I do not think these players know what West Indies cricket means to West Indians and followers of the global game. People feel sad for us and that‚Äôs just not right.

Ambrose was desperate to see an improvement at Headingley. ‚ÄúCome back with aggression, confidence and commitment,‚Äù he commanded the class of 2017. ‚ÄúOur history and the pride we once had in our cricket demands it.‚Äù

The man who admitted to killing the Navajo girl, Ashlynne Mike, faces life in prison without parole. (AP Photo/Russell Contreras, Files)

In a heinous case on the Navajo Nation, an 11-year-old girl was lured into a van, sexually assaulted and killed. The tribe did not seek to have the man who recently admitted to killing her put to death. American Indian tribes for decades have been able to tell federal prosecutors if they want a death sentence considered for certain crimes on their land. Nearly all have rejected that option.

Tribes and legal experts say the decision goes back to culture and tradition, past treatment of American Indians and fairness in the justice system. ‚ÄúMost Indian tribes were mistreated by the United States under past federal policies, and there can be historical trauma in cases associated with the execution of Native people,‚Äù said Robert Anderson, a University of Washington law professor and a member of the Bois Forte Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.

‚ÄúThis allows tribes to at least decide in those narrow circumstances when there should be a federal death penalty or not.‚Äù

In the Navajo case, Ashlynne Mike‚Äôs body wasn‚Äôt found until the next day. Her death in May 2016 renewed discussions there about capital punishment. Ashlynne‚Äôs mother has urged the tribe to opt into the death penalty, particularly for crimes that involve children.

The tribe long has objected to putting people to death, saying the culture teaches against taking a human life for vengeance.

For years, Theda New Breast has seen the effects of domestic violence, drug addiction and poverty on her Blackfeet Reservation in Montana. The healer helps those who suffer from the associated trauma. But regardless of the nature of the crime, the 61-year-old is staunchly against capital punishment. ‚ÄúOur beliefs, that I was raised with, say that no one has a right to take away a life except the Creator. Period,‚Äù New Breast said. ‚ÄúEnd of story.‚Äù

Congress expanded the list of death-penalty eligible crimes in the mid-1990s, allowing tribes to decide if they wanted their citizens subject to the death penalty. Legal experts say they are aware of only one tribe, the Sac and Fox Nation of Oklahoma, that has opted in.

‚ÄúThe measures taken by the DPRK (North Korea) to strengthen its nuclear deterrence and develop inter-continental rockets is justifiable and a legitimate option for self-defence in the face of such apparent and real threats,‚Äù Ju told the Geneva forum, referring to ‚Äúconstant nuclear threats‚Äù by the United States.

‚Äú‚Ä¶As long as the US hostile policy and nuclear threat remains unchallenged, the DPRK will never place its self-defensive nuclear deterrence on the negotiating table.‚Äù

"Shiv Sena should face hard reality, say BJP leaders","The distance between the two parties in terms of political as well as electoral clout is stark. The distance between the two parties in terms of political as well as electoral clout is stark.

Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana never fails to let go off any chance to attack ruling partner BJP for its perceived failures. However, for a party that sees itself as a dominant regional force, the Shiv Sena, over the past two years, has been facing the hard political reality that in the coming few years, it may have to play the second fiddle to the BJP, which has been growing in strength in the state.

Maharashtra‚Äôs elections, which saw the BJP, Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP jostling for space, have over the past two years turned into a race between the BJP and the Sena, being the two dominant players.

However, the distance between the two parties in terms of political as well as electoral clout is stark. There are 27 municipal corporations in Maharashtra of which 18 went to polls after the BJP attained power at the Centre and in Maharashtra. Post 2014, of the 2,050 seats in these 18 corporations the BJP has won a massive 653 seats. The Sena stands at a distant second with 369 seats. The domination of the BJP has been so strong that of these 18 corporations it controls a dozen.

Once a junior ally of the Sena, the BJP has left its partner far behind. The Sena is increasingly being forced to play the second fiddle to the BJP. ‚ÄúWe only have branches in Mumbai and Thane,‚Äù a whatsapp forward that went viral a few months back summed up the Sena‚Äôs quandary in Maharashtra. ‚ÄúIf you see other states, the BJP has grown on the back of regional parties to subsequently consume them and become the dominant force. It happened with the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party in Goa as well as the Asom Gana Parishad in Assam. The Sena may choose to fight the BJP in Maharashtra but as of now, the gap between the two is too big to fill quickly,‚Äù a senior Shiv Sena leader said.

In spite of the gloom a BJP win spreads in the Sena, certain sections in the party still believe they can beat the BJP at its own game. ‚ÄúOur party president has made it clear that we will fight all subsequent elections on our own. Yes we did lose but even the Marathas lost in Panipat and they subsequently went on to win Delhi,‚Äù Maharashtra Transport Minister and senior Shiv Sena leader Diwakar Raote said.

While the party chooses to be belligerent, all it can do now is respect the public sentiment which has as of now given a bigger mandate to the BJP. Political analysts believe that Uddhav Thackeray has a lot of work to do before he joins the ranks of regional satraps who dominate their states. Senior BJP leader Kirit Somaiyya said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs high time the Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray shed his arrogance and come to terms with reality.‚Äù

Farah Khan says Ananya is too lovely to be Chunky Pandey‚Äôs daughter,"Farah Khan takes a jibe at Chunky Pandey, disbelieves that Ananya is his daughter. Farah Khan takes a jibe at Chunky Pandey, disbelieves that Ananya is his daughter.

Chunky Pandey‚Äôs daughter Ananya has been one of the most talked about celebrity kids in Bollywood. Reports suggest various Bollywood biggies like Karan Johar and Salman Khan are keen to launch Ananya. But this time, she has caught another director‚Äôs attention, and no, it is not for a movie.

When mother Bhavna Pandey uploaded a picture of daughter Ananya on her Instagram, one of the first people to comment was Om Shant Om director Farah Khan and her comment is no more sensational than the picture itself. She wrote, ‚ÄúDo a dna test pls.. shes too lovely to b chunkys child,‚Äù and even added a laughter emoticon with it. Well, well, is Farah taking a jibe at Chunky? We see good humour, wonder what Chunky has to say to this.

In an interview earlier with Mirror Today, Chunky said that he has no qualms if Ananya wants to enter Bollywood. He had said, ‚ÄúYes, Ananya wants to be an actress and she had informed me about her decision some time ago. Be it Ahaan or Ananya, I want the kids to create their own identity and be a brand in their own right.‚Äù

"Malegaon 2008 blast case: Citing differences in chargesheets, Supreme Court grants Lt Col Purohit bail","Shrikant Purohit (Source: File) Shrikant Purohit (Source: File)

THE SUPREME Court on Monday granted bail to Lt Col Shrikant Purohit, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, observing that there were contradictions in the chargesheets filed by the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The court said his ‚Äúright to bail‚Äù cannot be denied merely because the ‚Äúsentiments of the community‚Äù were ‚Äúagainst‚Äù him.

‚ÄúKeeping in view the fact that NIA has submitted the supplementary chargesheet which is at variance with the chargesheet filed by the ATS, and that the trial is likely to take a long time and the appellant has been in prison for about eight years and eight months, we are of the considered view that the appellant has made out a prima facie case for release on bail and we deem it appropriate to enlarge the appellant herein on bail,‚Äù said a bench of Justices R K Agrawal and A M Sapre.

‚ÄúAt the stage of granting bail, a detailed examination of evidence and elaborate documentation of the merits of the case has not to be undertaken. The grant or denial (of bail) is regulated, to a large extent, by the facts and circumstances of each particular case. But at the same time, right to bail is not to be denied merely because of the sentiments of the community against the accused,‚Äù it added.

‚ÄúLiberty of a citizen is undoubtedly important, but this is to balance with the security of the community. A balance is required to be maintained between the personal liberty of the accused and the investigational rights of the agency. It must result in minimum interference with the personal liberty of the accused and the right of the agency to investigate the case,‚Äù said the court.

On the contradictions between the NIA and ATS chargesheets, the bench said these are ‚Äúto be tested at the time of trial and this court cannot pick or choose one version over the other‚Äù.

The case dates back to September 29, 2008, when six people were killed in a bomb blast at Malegaon. Purohit was arrested in November 2008.

Though the NIA had opposed the bail plea, the supplementary chargesheet filed by the agency mentioned that the recovery of RDX from the house of an accused, Sudhakar Chaturvedi, was suspect as there were doubts that it could have been planted by the ATS.

Senior Counsel Harish Salve had pointed out to the court that ATS Assistant Police Inspector Bagde was found in Chaturvedi‚Äôs house on November 2, 2008, when the latter was not at home. Taking this into account, the court said: ‚ÄúIt is also pertinent to mention here that the ATS conducted a search of the house of Accused-11 (Chaturvedi) on November 25, 2008. wherefrom they had taken the swab of RDX which creates a doubt on the recovery of RDX.‚Äù

During the hearing, the court had wondered if anything remained of the charges against Purohit if there were doubts regarding his role in the supply of RDX.

On the ATS claim that he had floated the Hindu outfit, Abhinav Bharat, which is alleged to be behind the Malegaon blast, Purohit, who was with the Army Intelligence, contended that it was a ‚Äúcovert operation‚Äù to infiltrate the group and that he had passed on information to his superior officers.

The court asked Purohit to furnish a personal security of Rs 1 lakh, two additional sureties of the same amount, and surrender his passport before being released on bail.

The court also told him that he should make himself available for the investigation, as and when required by the NIA, and should ‚Äúnot, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade that person from disclosing such facts to the court or to the investigating agency or to any police officer‚Äù.

In April, the Bombay High Court granted bail to Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, another accused in the case. The high court had rejected Purohit‚Äôs bail plea.

World Badminton Championship: Satwiksairaj Rankireddy shares crackling chemistry with K Maneesha,"Kimdabi Srikanth won his opening match in Glasgow. (Source: Reuters) Kimdabi Srikanth won his opening match in Glasgow. (Source: Reuters)

Satwiksairaj Rankireddy was told in no uncertain terms when he arrived from his long U.S. flight last month that the World Championships meant he wasn‚Äôt allowed to be jet-lagged and not permitted to take off on Sundays.

Good fortune had come their way, when second-string doubles pairings from Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia opted to head to the South-East Asian Games instead of the World Championships. Chinese Taipei ‚Äî another buzzing team ‚Äî were ensuring their World Universiade tally looked pretty at home. It opened up spots for Indians on the fringe to make a mark at the World Championships. For some time now, it has been apparent that Satwik is the most exciting talent on India‚Äôs doubles scene, but his coaches knew he needed fortitude to go with that slice of fortune.

He was pulled out from a tournament in New Zealand a month ago, and packed off half a world away to another scenic country in the northern hemisphere to be better prepared. There was a price to pay: ‚ÄúThey cancelled all my Sundays for a month. We trained everyday,‚Äù the teenage sensation, known for his pulverising doubles attack, had said prior to leaving for the Worlds.

His potential has been the talk of the town, but what wasn‚Äôt known was his crackling chemistry with K Maneesha, a feisty if much weaker mixed doubles partner in the pairing. The two, ranked 77 on the circuit currently, have played alongside each other for many years. And they lit up Day 1 of the World Championships for India with a mini-upset 24-22, 21-17 win over Hong Kong‚Äôs World No 51 Tam Chun Hei and NG Tsz Yau.

It was a stomping display from the two, who bullied their opponents into submission after trailing 13-18 in the opening game, picking up their tempo in the big moments.

There‚Äôs a refreshing honesty to this pair that concedes that not playing together for a few months worked brilliantly for them. ‚ÄúGood we didn‚Äôt play or we would have been fighting with each other,‚Äù Satwik said, after the exciting 44-minute scrap-off.

Satwik is tall, powerful, attacking and has improved his game manifolds after coach Kim Tan Her coaxed him to stop playing in juniors and focus on seniors instead. Suddenly, he was at the Thomas Cup and Sudirman Cup and Super Series, a quick learner lapping up all the experience and pace that the opportunity provided. He would play one of the best matches of his short career with India‚Äôs top doubles shuttler Ashwini Ponappa ‚Äî a combination that offers much hope in the coming days. But at the Worlds, he was paired with Maneesha, a smaller player with a gutsy temperament and clever brain, but physically not amongst the strongest.

With Satwik having zoomed off in the elevator, and Maneesha, though his senior, playing in the lower tiers of the game, frustration would set in when the two were compelled to play together. ‚ÄúShe irritates me a lot because her serve had gone very weak and it is difficult to adjust to a girl who is making mistakes,‚Äù Satwik says with exasperation, ‚Äúbut she‚Äôs taught me patience in life.‚Äù

Ashwini had been a steadier partner, not prone to errors, and Maneesha needed to prop up her serve and defence. ‚ÄúBut she worked very hard ‚Äî almost 4-5 hours just on her serve,‚Äù he says.

The duo had lost to the same pairing in Malaysia earlier in the year, and the pressure was on the Indians. Sweating on Sundays was about to yield returns. ‚ÄúOur endurance conditioning for a month was a lot of track running ‚Äî 10 rounds of 400m every single day just to help us last this level,‚Äù Satwik had said. India‚Äôs modest doubles teams needed the base work to give themselves a chance of making the most of the gaping draws.

The Indians would trail by 5 points, looking like exiting early on Monday, before Maneesha got sturdier in defence, and began rediscovering the front-court understanding she‚Äôs shared with Satwik for years. The pair operates on a basic plan ‚Äî Maneesha sets up the kills for her junior partner, and his big smash does the rest. ‚ÄúMy strength is Satwiksairaj,‚Äù Maneesha said, when asked what part of her game worked on the day. ‚ÄúI just create openings and he finishes points.‚Äù

The 21-year-old did more than that ‚Äî of course. Displaying immense control on the net, and fine acceleration of speed while finding the gaps, Maneesha would put the Hong Kong pair under pressure, even as Satwik worked the angles and executed the kills. The Indians would roar back from a 18-20 deficit in the first game, and take the three crucial points after levelling at 21-all to display a fighting temperament.

Pumping fists, and rotating at the net, the Indians would keep their opponents under the pump and take an early lead in the second. Keeping their nerve as they grabbed the momentum, the duo would finish off with greater verve in the second to move into Round 2 at their maiden Worlds. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on my serve that we won the last point,‚Äù Maneesha would say, after Satwik had badgered her through the month about the weak spot in her game.

Besides inadvertently boosting his patience, Maneesha might well have helped Satwik express himself more on court. ‚ÄúShe shouts at me for not shouting enough and showing aggression. I like playing quietly. But today I joined in as well,‚Äù he says.

Hold the line in Kathmandu,"Kathmandu: External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with Nepal‚Äôs Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba at a meeting in Kathmandu on Thursday. PTI Photo / (MEA Twitter) Kathmandu: External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with Nepal‚Äôs Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba at a meeting in Kathmandu on Thursday. PTI Photo / (MEA Twitter)

As Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba begins a five-day trip to India, he knows he must propitiate Delhi‚Äôs ruling deities, both prime minister Narendra Modi and the RSS, for the continuation of their support to Kathmandu‚Äôs hill elites to abandon the egalitarian cause of the Madhes. In the 11 years since Nepal overthrew its monarchy and became a republic, which India supported in full measure, there have been two big agitations by the people of the Madhes, literally the strip land that lies between Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and the rest of Nepal, in 2007 and in 2015. Both the Congress-led UPA in 2007 and the BJP-led NDA in 2015 supported the Madhesi cry for aspiration and equality. In the 2015 agitation, as many as 60 people lost their lives. And then Nepal‚Äôs hill elite cunningly played the China card.

Led by K.P. Sharma Oli, the chairman of the moderate Communist UML and supported by pro-monarchist parties like the RPP, a constitutional amendment in parliament fell short by 48 votes only two days before Deuba landed in Delhi. The amendment would have redrawn provincial boundaries to ensure wider representation of Madhesis in parliament. But as many as 39 MPs from Deuba‚Äôs own Nepali Congress and his coalition partner, the Maoists, were absent. No one asked them why.

Did Deuba try hard to get the amendment passed? Probably, but not hard enough. Nor did Delhi seem particularly perturbed. External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj told Nepali lawmakers in Kathmandu a fortnight ago that in a democracy everyone must participate in elections. The message to the Madhesis, who had refused to join the first two rounds of local body elections in recent months unless the amendment was passed, was clear: India had abandoned the Madhesi cause. The sullen and despairing Madhesis admit that it may be unfair to lay the blame only at Oli‚Äôs door. The man has never made any bones about his distaste for the dark-skinned people of the Tarai ‚Äî or for that matter, his ambition to be prime minister again. Across the political spectrum, Madhesis know that at least for the time being, their struggle for equality is over.

Over four months in 2015-16, the Modi government had bravely boosted the struggle for equality through the Madhesi-led economic blockade of the Tarai. But when Oli embarked on a trip to China soon after the blockade and signed a transit agreement for access to Chinese ports as well as trans-national rail links the first signs of nervousness began to show in Delhi. Oli was clearly trying to create alternative forms of connectivity, away from Nepal‚Äôs dependency on its southern neighbour. The Chinese pressed the advantage. In May 2017, Nepal joined China‚Äôs One Belt, One Road initiative. Only a week after Swaraj returned from Kathmandu on August 10, Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang was in Nepal, wooing Deuba, promising aid, trade and economic projects, including building a railway up to the Nepal border and expanding the Kodari highway. India‚Äôs sense of encirclement by China seems much more magnified in Nepal because of the special relationship with Kathmandu. There‚Äôs an open border between the two countries, seven lakh Nepali citizens work in India, while languages, religions and cultures are similar.

Meanwhile, the RSS went to work. Although Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has held his tongue since he came to office, he has hardly been able to live down his 2016 much-publicised speech at the World Hindu Conference in Nepal, in which he glorified the monarchy. ‚ÄúWe have to go to the people and make them aware that without the rule of the Shahs, there would not be Nepal, one single Nepal,‚Äù Adityanath had said. The feeling that a Hindu Rashtra had kept the Chinese at bay is getting stronger by the day in Delhi. Oli‚Äôs successes with the Chinese have compounded the view that it was all very well to support the egalitarian struggle of the Madhesis, but that they are far too divided to have any real influence in Kathmandu. So, if Delhi has to play the great game in the Himalayas, it must return to those who have traditionally wielded power.

The problem with this kind of flip-flop is that it makes Modi look like an indecisive potentate. He had started off so well during his several visits to Nepal over 2014-15. But he now looks in danger of succumbing to the RSS, losing his nerve on supporting a just struggle for the Madhes and promoting a short-sighted perspective on India-Nepal relations. But if Modi is here for the long haul, then he must understand that democracy and realpolitik also go together. None other than the great G.P. Koirala, who became prime minister after Gyanendra the monarch had been overthrown in the ‚Äújan andolan‚Äù in 2006, had promised India‚Äôs then envoy Shiv Mukherjee that equal rights would be given to the Madhesis.

So why is Deuba going back on the promise made by his own predecessor? Modi must see that the Nepalis are toying with him, forcing him to go back on his own word. Just like in Bhutan‚Äôs Doklam, Modi must hold the line. His own South Asian legacy is at stake.

Torino say legitimate goal disallowed despite VAR,"Torino claimed they had a goal wrongly disallowed despite the referee consulting a video assistant referee (VAR). (Source: Twitter) Torino claimed they had a goal wrongly disallowed despite the referee consulting a video assistant referee (VAR). (Source: Twitter)

The use of video replays at matches ran into trouble in Serie A on Sunday when Torino claimed they had a goal wrongly disallowed despite the referee consulting a video assistant referee (VAR).

Torino‚Äôs match at Bologna ended 1-1 after they had an 83rd minute goal by Alex Berenguer disallowed for offside against Andrea Belotti who had provided the assist.

Replays showed, however, that the ball had been played to Belotti by an opponent, putting him onside. The referee blew for offside before Berenguer had put the ball into the net and so could not change his decision even after consulting the VAR, which took several minutes.

‚ÄúThey disallowed a legitimate goal,‚Äù said Torino coach Sinisa Mihajlovic. ‚ÄúThe whole stadium saw that (Bologna‚Äôs) Mattia Destro played the ball to Belotti, so much so that Bologna continued playing. Then the referee blew for offside.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have been told that, if there is a doubt, play should continue and then the referee should make his decision. But he blew the whistle first, and that was the mistake.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only human to make mistakes, but he needed to let the game continue,‚Äù Mihajlovic added. ‚ÄúOtherwise, what‚Äôs the point of VAR?‚Äù

At one point in the game, the crowd were told that the VAR system was not working before it was later announced that it had been fixed.
