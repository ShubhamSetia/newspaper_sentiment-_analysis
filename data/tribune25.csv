Being the last day of the last session of the 12the Vidhan Sabha, the Assembly today ended on a cordial note as treasury and opposition benches unanimously passed the Himachal Pradesh University of Health Sciences Bill, 2017 and bid adieu with the hope to return after winning the elections. Even though the Assembly started on a stormy note with BJP leaders, including Leader of Opposition PK Dhumal and BJP’s Chief Whip Suresh Bhardwaj, demanding a debate under Rule 67 Speaker BBL Butail adjourned the House at 11.10 am for 50 minutes, giving time for talks to break the logjam that has been on for the last three days. The House re-assembled at 12.20 pm with Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Agnihotri striking a conciliatory note to get the Opposition to cooperate and participate in the proceedings, with today being the last day of all the MLA’s during the presnt term of the House. “Today is not just the last day of this House but also Ganesh Chaturthi and we do not know how many of us will return as MLAs as our fate is in the hands of the public, so we must part on a cordial note,” he urged. While thanking Dhumal and Suresh Bhardwaj, Agnihotri urged that the whole House must rise above politics and take up business, especially the Medical Sciences University Bill, 2017 which is in the state interest. Responding to the gesture from the ruling benches, Bhardwaj acted positively while admitting that everyone must part on a happy and not a bitter note. He added that his party had decided to participate in the proceedings and end the session and this term of the Assembly on a positive note.

Jalandhar, August 24

Jalandhar has been put on high alert and prohibitory orders imposed ahead of the court verdict in the alleged rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.

The Deputy Commissioner has imposed section 144-A in the entire district. Likewise, people have been debarred from carrying weapons and wireless sets except the police and para-military forces.

Though intelligence reports have ruled out any riot-like situation in the district, DC Varinder Sharma has directed all officials to be prepared for any exigency that may come after the special CBI court will announce its verdict tomorrow in the dera chief case.

Along with the deployment of the police force, the BSF and the Sashashtra Seema Bal (SSB), the Army has also been put on standby for help to maintain law and order, while the Centre has assured all possible help to both states.

According to Jalandhar Police Commissioner Praveen Sinha, the situation in Jalandhar is expected to remain peaceful as there are only 2,000-3,000 followers in the entire district. “While the dera leaders have assured all cooperation to us in maintaining peace and harmony in the area, much will depend on the court’s verdict tomorrow and its cascading effect that may reach the city as well,” said Sinha.

Though the district administration has not issued any advisory to the religious organisations, the police have tightened security around religious shrines as well.

Later, in a meeting held with all the Sub Divisional Magistrates and Executive Magistrates, the DC told them to keep a strict vigil over the law and order situation in the areas of their respective jurisdiction in the wake of the impending judgment against Dera Sacha Sauda head.

He told officials not to leave their stations for two days. Sharma categorically said that any sort of callousness towards duty in this hour was not tolerable, adding that the officials should tie up with their counterparts in the Police Department and prepare a joint strategy for dealing with any sort of untoward situation.

He also said that a strict check must be kept over rumour mongers so that people were not misled by anyone. He directed the officials to adopt zero tolerance towards the miscreants or anti-social elements trying to create any sort of disturbance.

Sharma said officials must lay major thrust on maintaining law and order situation in the district along with promoting the ethos of communal harmony, peace and brotherhood at every cost.

The Deputy Commissioner also solicited the support of people for the maintenance of peace and harmony. He said people should not get panicky as the district administration was fully vigilant to tackle any sort of situation.

Sharma told the officials to ensure that in compliance with the orders of the state government all educational institutions within their jurisdiction were closed tomorrow. He said strict action would be taken against the educational institutes violating the directions of the state."
Govt favoured pvt distillery: Cong,"Tribune News Service

Dehradun, August 24

Leader of the Opposition in state Assembly Indira Hridayesh today accused the state government of putting a blanket ban on recruitments and favouring a private distillery over the government cooperative for manufacturing liquor. Addressing a press conference, Indira Hridayesh said, “Far from fulfilling the electoral promises, the BJP government upon being elected in Uttarakhand has put a blanket ban on recruitments. The government should offer an explanation to the people.” She accused the government of pursuing a revenue-driven excise policy without exercising caution or restraint. She alleged that the state government in order to earn more revenue had stopped manufacturing Gulab, a country liquor brand, at the cooperative distillery to favour a private distillery owner at Bajpur. “The Gulab brand, with light content, has been shut in favour of a stronger brand, Dabang, manufactured by a private company. The locals are getting addicted to it,” she rued. She accused the state government of delaying the CBI probe in the NH-74 land scam. “The Central government is not keen on the probe. It is protecting the NHAI officials at the behest of the Centre,” alleged Hridayesh."
The Java connect,"Pulsating with performances, art and life, the city of Yogyakarta in Indonesia gives you the feel of being in a different era

Akash Mehrotra

An ancient city and the last remaining Sultanate of Indonesia, Yogyakarta has been a cradle of art and culture and for long nurtured the Javanese connection with the outer world. Old ways of life exist side by side with bustling modernity here and the city decorates itself with the symbols of Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. From shadow puppetry, the age old extraordinary Buddhist temple of Borobodur and the equally impressive Hindu ones of Prambanan, socially aware graffiti on the wall to the beautifully styled Batik designs; Yogyakarta, Indonesia’s second most visited spot, is a cultural palette on display.

The city comes as a huge relief from the urbane madness of Jakarta; narrow roads lined with trees, old buildings wearing a colonial touch, shops styled as pagodas, alleys lined with themed restaurants, art cafes often buzzing with some performances, random music bands performing on streets, endless boards advertising batik designing lessons, and strangers wearing a gracious smile; Yogyakarta gives you a feeling of being in a different era.

The city is always throbbing with performances, mostly unannounced. An art gallery will host a performer or a dance troupe visiting the city performing an ancient myth, puppetry shows in some random corner around the Sultan’s palace, rappers set up on a plaza, some impromptu performance in some coffee shop or even private homes inviting strangers for a local gamelan performance; festivals can pop up in any corner.

And as you remain on the lookout for the art scenes, don’t miss to do what all travel blogs tell you. Yogyakarta is a Unesco heritage site for its old temples and its age-old puppetry tradition. Put these in your ‘must-do’ list and then proceed. Start off your day with the Krotan Palace, snaking your way through the alleys of the old town, an area owned by the Sultan. The palace stands like a happy collision between the conformist and the iconoclastic. Perhaps, the most captivating, the Gamelan music, an ensemble of bronze percussion instruments, including gongs, xylophones and drums, often combined with string and wind instruments as well as vocals, can be experienced regularly throughout the week.

At a stone’s throw is the water castle. At a walkable distance from there, through the narrow alleys, housing some painters, designers and artists is the underground masque.

Cut to evening and brace yourself for some more artesia. In the north of the airport stands another emblem of Yogyakarta cultural heritage — the Prambanan temple. The towering temples with spires and spectacularly sculpted walls are a treat to watch. The temple also serves a backdrop of the Ramayana ballet, a spectacular staging of the South Asian Hindu epic, in a dance drama form, with firelights, extravagant costumes, gamelan orchestra, grandeur and an adroit mastery in story-telling. The town seems to have grown up with the Ramayana tales, no wonder many kids (including Muslim kids) have been named after characters of The Ramayana.

The Borobodur Temple

Ditch that urge to lie in late and take an hour-long drive past the enchanting countryside to the Borobodur temple, the largest Buddhist temple excavated in the early 19th century by the then British king of Indonesia, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. Sitting atop a hill, surrounded by volcanoes, Borobodur haunts with its striking architectural beauty. A colossal 30 metre-high step pyramid, housing some 500 Buddha sculptures perched around and lower terraces built as balustrades with countless sculptures from Buddha’s life and teachings, the temple is a sight to behold.

In the early 19th century, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles heard of the site and ordered its excavation. Even though one can find enough cues of this decay in the temple, Borobodur stands as a defining architectural piece and attracts hundreds of travellers and art lovers from across the world, for academic revelations and picture perfect moments.

Both Prambanan and Borobodur, give a peep into how elegantly Yogyakarta embraced and nurtured different cultures and religious ideals, which still live in the daily rituals of the common folk in the form of rituals, myths, stories passed on from one generation to other, puppetry shows, music, dance forms or just as symbols hung on doorsteps."
World Championships: India’s Big Three enter quarters,"Glasgow, August 24

Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth stand just a win away from grabbing a medal at the World Badminton Championship as they entered the quarterfinals here today. Sindhu, who won bronze in the 2013 and 2014 editions of the event, survived a scare against Hong Kong’s Cheung Ngan Yi before prevailing 19-21 23-21 21-17 in a thrilling match that lasted an hour and 27 minutes. The 22-year-old Indian fought back from 13-16 down in the second game after losing the first to eventually come up trumps. Saina dished out a gritty performance to beat world No. 3 Korean Sung Ji Hyun 21-19 21-15. Srikanth, however, eased into the quarterfinals with a straight-game win over Denmark’s Anders Antonsen. On a 12-match winning streak, Srikanth knocked out world No. 18 Antonsen 21-14 21-18. The world No. 10 Indian will clash with world No. 1 Son Wan Ho in the quarterfinals. “It will be tough in the quarters but I have been improving with each match and am looking forward to a good game tomorrow,” said Srikanth.

Praneeth, Jayaram out

Later in the day, Sai Praneeth and Ajay Jayaram suffered contrasting defeats to crash out of the tournament. Praneeth fought hard before going down 21-19 10-21 12-21 to world No. 4 Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei, while Jayaram, who had beaten The Netherland’s Mark Caljouw yesterday, proved no match for two-time defending champion Chen Long of China as he lost 11-21 10-21 in 41 minutes. India’s top mixed doubles pair of Pranaav Jerry Chopra and N Sikki Reddy, seeded 15th, played their heart out before going down 22-20 18-21 18-21 to Indonesia’s world No. 6 pair of Debby Susanto and Praveen Jordan. “So far it has really been a very good performance and I am very pleased with the players. We did lose a couple of close doubles matches that could have gone our way but overall it has been satisfying,” said India’s chief coach P Gopichand. It was the end of the road for Sameer Verma as well – the Syed Modi Grand Prix Gold winner suffered a 20-22 9-21 loss against Rajiv Ouseph. National champion Rituparna Das, too, bowed out after losing 16-21 13-21 to local favourite Kirsty Gilmour. The women’s doubles pair of Sanjana Santosh and Arathi Sara Sunil also bowed out with a 14-21 15-21 loss to the Chinese combination of Bao Yixin and Yu Xiaohan. Among others, five-time champion Lin Dan, his compatriot Tian Houwei, Viktor Axelsen and Hong Kong’s Wong Wing Ki Vincent also entered the quarterfinals. In the women’s singles, China’s Chen Yufei stunned top seed Akane Yamaguchi to reach the quarters. Thailand’s Ratchanok Intanon, Carolina Marin, Japan’s Nozomi Okuhara also made the last-eight. — PTI"

"Punjab, Haryana sit on the names of their members","Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, august 24

BCCI’s state units were supposed to send the names of all their members, both voters and non-voters, to the Committee of Administrators (CoA) by August 8. It’s been more than two weeks since the deadline passed but as many as 15 units are yet to comply with the directive. From the North Zone, only the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) and the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) have sent the list; the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA), the Haryana Cricket Association (HCA) and the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) continue to drag their feet on the issue. “What are they scared of? Why can’t they share the names of their members? Their caginess shows there’s something wrong, there’s something they don’t want out in the open,” said Rakesh Handa, secretary of the Punjab Cricket Players Association (PCPA). The state units’ reluctance to make the names public is indeed baffling and lends credence to Handa’s misgivings. RP Singla, a convenor of the interim committee overseeing the PCA affairs, however, assures that everything is above board and the committee would send the updated list in a couple of days. “Look, we’ve been updating the list. We’ve found that a few of the members have passed away, but the association wasn’t informed about it. So, we are checking everything, and that’s why it’s taking us some time,” said Singla. CoA had issued the directive on August 2, and gave the state associations six days to complete the task. Many responded within the given time frame and a few others took a little more time. Why were some state units able to accomplish the job within a few days, and why are the other 15 units taking so long to verify everything and send out the list? It seems the lack of intent on the part of these non-complying units is one of the major reasons behind the delay. “If these units can’t comply with such a simple directive, how could you trust them when they say they are ready to implement the Lodha Committee reforms?” said Handa about PCA."
Amendments to deal with today’s ills,"CONSUMER BEWARE!

Pushpa Girimaji

Is it true that the Reserve Bank of India has amended the Banking Ombudsman Scheme to expand its jurisdiction? If so, can you please give some details?

Yes, the 2017 amendment to the Banking Ombudsman scheme has widened the scope of the scheme and brought under the ambit of the Ombudsman, a number of hitherto excluded issues pertaining to the banking operations.

To be more specific, the amendments finally provide for redress of a large number of highly vexatious problems faced by bank customers in recent years such as fraudulent withdrawal of money through electronic banking as well as stolen and cloned debit and credit cards, besides mis-selling of insurance, mutual funds and other investment products. Similarly, the amendments have also brought under the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman issues such as erroneous reporting of credit information to the Credit Information Bureau and the failure to rectify such factual inaccuracies. These are all issues on account of which consumers have for long suffered not just financial loss but also harassment and mental anguish. And in the absence of any redress at the ombudsman level, they have had to fight long battles before the consumer court. Finally, consumers can seek resolution of their disputes in these matters through the Ombudsman.

The revised ombudsman scheme, which came into effect from July 1 this year, includes in the list of ‘Grounds for complaint’, non-adherence to the instructions of the Reserve Bank vis-à-vis mobile banking/electronic banking services in respect of delay or failure to effect online payment or fund transfer and unauthorised electronic payment/fund transfer . Similarly, one can complain against banks for sale of unsuitable, improper financial products such as insurance and mutual funds, besides lack of transparency in such sale and delay in facilitating after sales service.

Another positive change brought about in the Ombudsman Scheme is the provision to award compensation for harassment and mental anguish, besides loss of the complainant’s time and other expenses, up to a limit of Rs 1 lakh. Despite the low limit, I really welcome this because earlier the Scheme provided for such compensation only in cases of credit card operations. So, extending this to all complaints is really good. Second, the compensation awarded for any loss suffered as a direct consequence of the bank’s omission or commission (or the pecuniary jurisdiction to pass an award) has been raised from Rs 10 lakh to 20 lakh.

Are there any pre-conditions that one must remember while filing a complaint before the Ombudsman?

One of the most important conditions is the requirement of the complainant going to the Ombudsman only after exhausting the complaint redress system available with the bank. The Scheme requires the complainant to first write to the bank (preferably the nodal officer) and approach the ombudsman only if there is no response within a month or if the response is not satisfactory. Consumers must remember this because a number of cases before the Ombudsmen are rejected for this reason.

Otherwise, filing a complaint before the Ombudsman is easy — you can even send it electronically. You do not need any lawyer and the process of resolution of the complaint is very simple. First and foremost, the Ombudsman will try to promote a settlement through conciliation or mediation between the parties and if it is agreeable to the complainant, will pass an order. If not, the Ombudsman will pass an award after giving both the parties an opportunity to present their case. One can also file an appeal against the order of the Ombudsman before the Appellate Authority.

The complaint has to be filed before the Ombudsman under whose jurisdiction the bank branch concerned is situated. However, in case of credit card and other types of services with centralised operations, a complaint can be filed before the Ombudsman under whose territorial jurisdiction the billing address of the complainant is located. You can get the details of the scheme as well as the addresses of the 20 Ombudsmen in the country from the website of the Reserve Bank of India."
Rocky rocks!,"MOVIE REVIEW - ROCKY MENTAL

Jasmine Singh

Action thriller may be a popular genre with Bollywood, but when it comes to Punjabi cinema, we have seen filmmakers attempting it only in bits and parts. And now here is a film, Rocky Mental, that takes on the genre full throttle, justifying action and thrill. Debutant director Vikram Thori’s film Rocky Mental gives Punjabi cinema a solid punch with its action. The story of the film, of an aspiring boxer caught on the wrong side of the fence, is though not a new thing for cine-goers, what, however, is new here is the treatment. The opening of the film goes overboard in establishing the character of Rocky, aka Parmish Verma, but soon enough everything fall in place. The dialogues of the film can make you pick up Punjabi’s shabd kosh, nevertheless they fit the bill. Rocky Mental is a quick watch, moving crisply from one scene to the other, justifying each action. It is the friendship angle in the film, which brings in moments of lightness and laughter. Though there are moments when the movie digresses from the main plot, next moment it immediately goes back on the right path for which the director Vikram Thori definitely needs a word of praise. Rocky Mental marks the debut of video director, Parmish Verma as an actor on silver screen. Undoubtedly, Parmish has nailed his character, he not looks dashing on screen, he can act with intensity and with warmth. Punjabi cinema can count on him for intense action and except some comedy too! Next up is the artiste, who showed us his acting skill in the Punjabi film, Qissa Panjab, Dheeraj Kumar. Dheeraj not only acts superbly, the artiste can be credited for giving the main character a strong support. Jagjeet Sandhu is yet another actor from Qissa Panjab and in Rocky Mental he shows his comic timing as well. Though we feel Jagjeet has far more talent then what we saw in Rocky Mental. Karanveer Khullar and Mahabir Bhullar and two other artistes have justified their roles. As for line producer, Darshan Aulakh, Punjabi cinema has got another bad man. Actress Tannu Kaur Gill makes her debut with Rocky Mental, and we bet the entertainment industry can register her name in the list of pretty faces, who can act too, if allowed. The film’s music is macho, strong and likeable. Sharry Mann’s track, Yaara, is an emotional song, reminding us of Jaane Nahi Dainge Tujhe from 3 Idiots. Rocky Mental does has its share of pull-down factors, but it is the action thrilling moments that attract major points, and then of course, we have Rocky (Parmish Verma), who rocks!

Solan, August 25

Heavy rain triggered landslides on the Parwanoo-Dharampur stretch of the national highway today with debris also falling on the railway track between Sanwara and Koti. The rail authorities were informed around 3:30 pm and the staff were pressed into service to clear the track. The work was accomplished till 5:30 pm. Since the next train was scheduled to cross at 6:30 pm, there was no disruption to the rail traffic. The area received heavy rain till afternoon and several landslides were visible on the road. An inspection of the rail track near Sanwara was also carried out by officials of the NHAI and GR Infra Limited executing the four-laning work. Devasis Patra, project director, GR Infra, revealed that the debris on the rail track had flowed down through a culvert from the opposite side which had been dumped by a builder. A report would be sent to the Deputy Commissioner, Solan, soon. Road traffic also remained obstructed near Sanwara from 3 pm to 4 pm when debris and huge boulders fell on the road. JCB machines were pressed into service to clear the road. Debris dumped at various sites by GR Infra has become a cause for concern for the authorities as it is flowing down onto the land in rain. Several bighas arable land have been eroded at Chakki Ka Mor following debris a few days ago. Though engineers of GR Infra had inspected the site and suggested preventive steps, little could be done to check the flow of debris."
A canvas for fashion,"Installations and scenography are the new buzzwords at fashion shows across the country

Swati Rai

if 29 Rooms, the installation at last year’s New York Fashion Week in Bushwick, is anything to go by, it can safely be presumed that art in high fashion is a globally rising trend. Designed to inspire creativity and, of course, Instagram posts, the 80,000 square foot warehouse saw installations by artists as well as fashion designers, amongst them the likes of Michael Kors. Kors’ concept titled The Sidewalk is Your Runway, had people posing with his famed bags and posting the captures on social media. Fashion and its interpretation have changed over the years. This change reflects itself not just in the colour and texture, but also in the way fashion is presented to people today. Artistic installations and scenography for a fashionably ambient presentation are an off shoot of that. Bold designing steps see couturiers seeking artistic outlet to jazz up the ramp and, in turn, create an immersive experience for the onlooker. While we have had the trend impressing the fashion scene abroad, it is catching up in India too, be it at the last two India Couture Weeks or Lakme Fashion Week. Designers have been successful in creating scenes and vignettes both on and off the ramps. Recently, seven fashion icons — Sabyasachi Mukherji, JJ Valaya, Tarun Tahiliani, Rajesh Pratap Singh, Shantanu & Nikhil, Abraham & Thakore and Narendra Kumar Ahmed — were invited by Godrej India Culture Lab to reflect on the Partition of India through their designs. These were presented in a fashion-meets-art installation at the Lakme Fashion Week and would be permanently housed at The Partition Museum in Amritsar. At the recent ICW, designer Anamika Khanna, in her show entitled Happily Ever After, chose to have a multi-dimensional mannequin theme reflecting various stages in a marital journey — from betrothal to the nuptials. Wide-eyed stationary models brought alive the theme with scenes created to match the outfit and the occasion. An installation is also about a designer’s mind. Also at ICW, Gaurav Gupta brought to the ramp a bit of the fantasy world he inhabits. An esoteric world found itself taking shape and offering the audience a quick mood elevation. The ramp became a barren yet rich moonscape with huge glass blowouts radiating in a purple haze as the show opened. It felt as if one was suspended in the bubble for a moment. In his own words: “I added a new dimension to a mythological forest by creating a floating space in between. It sort of mirrored the fantasy space in my head, which I inhabit most of the time. There was foliage in glass on the 10 installations, measuring between 7 and 10 feet, which we created.” A more traditional take was Manav Gangwani’s latest couture collection, India@70. It showcased the god and goddesses of India and meenakari on Patolas and Paithani to reflect different cultural imprints of the country. Big and bold Kathakali masks worn by models accentuated the show. A model perched on the grand staircase of a hotel foyer reflected the Prime Minister’s Make in India campaign, showcasing an intricately designed silhouette of a lion. Sharing his design landscape, Gangwani says, “The fashion industry has evolved over the past few years. We now have so much inspiration around us in India. Monumental structures, cultural diversity and geographical differences have helped me curate this collection… I have taken inspiration from every region of India to create this collection and to give the audience this experience.” FDCI president Sunil Sethi isn’t surprised by the increasing room for art in fashion. “Deep down, all designers think of themselves as artists and this creative force comes out in their collections — be it in the set design or as an installation fashion show.” Still, he feels art is just an embellishment for a fashion show. Designs have to be the real powerhouse. “I feel that the philosophy or the thought process of a designer will remain hidden if the clothes in his/her collection fail to do so. It’s the clothes and not the art work that is important.” While crediting digital technology and advanced projection techniques for the innovation on ramp, he hints at the limited scope of the trend too. “Such scenography has more scope and visibility in couture and not so much in pret,” Sethi says."
A travel back in time,"Shailesh BR’s most recent work, Tarka, looks like an interpretation of childhood memories

Monica Arora

Shailesh BR’s work is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected that you may have seen amongst contemporary artists in the recent times, and that is what makes it all the more engaging and awe inspiring. He draws inspiration from several concepts in Sanskrit, a language he studied and mastered for some 14 years during his early childhood. His creations reflect the rural upbringing and simplicity of life as in his village, where even an electric bulb was regarded as a huge miracle. In an interview during a Khoj workshop in 2015, Shailesh had articulated, “I do not know how to work, but I sure can create for my own and from my own.”A post-graduate from Faculty of Fine Arts, MSU, Baroda, the artist uses the ordinariness of mundane objects to turn their notion or existence around. He recently put up his first solo show at the Vadhera Art Gallery in New Delhi as part of Foundation for Contemporary Indian Art (FICA)’s Emerging Artist Award Programme. This show was known as Tarka, being derived from Tarka Shastra or the art of debating, enquiring and logical reasoning as prescribed in ancient Sanskrit philosophy. Through his myriad creations, he has questioned the origin, life journey and end of several objects and that is what draws onlookers to this unique body of work. Occupying centre piece at the exhibition was the Kshir Dhara, a series of sculptures that explore repeated actions whilst performing religious ceremonies such as the grinding of chandan on a slab or application of tilak on the forehead. These are used as metaphors in sculptures made from material such as wax, motor, sandalwood, honey, motor, water, milk, copper. Created from rubber, motor, iron was The Tongue, a set of kinetic sculptures that represents the various sensory functions and organs of the body that pertain to sensations of touch, taste, smell, sight and so on. Similarly, the Hot Tongue, comprising of plaster, coil and iron mesh, seems to be a satirical statement on the art of glib talking and nonsensical jargon, which is innately ingrained in the political and bureaucratic machinery. The most evocative of all creations was the Philosophy Machine. Essentially a wooden rotating disc fitted with lamps arranged in a circle, it has a gas flame pipe to light the lamps at one end and a blower pipe to extinguish them. This remarkable creation is a representation of the circle of life and is a stunning commentary on the fact that death is inevitable. Philosphy Machine Drawings was a series of 48 drawings. These inhabit little corners at the gallery and are mostly arranged as asymmetrical drawings on vintage, sepia-tinted and yellowing paper that appear as blueprints or pages from a novella or a personal diary or an old school examination. In most, there is no attention paid to any spelling or grammatical errors and reflect a childlike innocence with several drafts, cuts, scratches and random musings. Also, the 46 tongue drawings are an extension of the sculpture and endeavour to decode the tongue as an organ of taste, articulation and hence, as an allegory for human emotions, sensory as well as of the mind faculties. It’s almost as if he had taken tiny bits of childhood memorabilia and when he saw similar objects during adulthood, he re-interpreted those in a completely different manner and re-arranged the conventionality and typicality associated with them."
"Sector 16 stadium back in news, for different reason","Gulu Ezekiel

New Delhi, August 24

The Sector 16 Cricket Stadium in Chandigarh is where the likes of Kapil Dev, Yograj Singh and Chetan Sharma learned the ropes of pace bowling. The stadium is back in the news, designated a “temporary jail” for the trial of Dera Sacha Sauda Sirsa chief Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in Panchkula on Friday. The stadium has staged just one Test match and five ODIs, the last one in October 2007. It fell out of favour when the new PCA stadium was constructed in Mohali in 1993. But there is a reason why the venue has a special place in the hearts of Indian cricket fans — it was here that the teenaged Sachin Tendulkar played his maiden Test match on home soil, against Sri Lanka in November 1990, after 10 Tests abroad. India were playing a home Test for the first time in two years and won this one-off Test by an innings and 8 runs. Though Tendulkar scored only 11 in India’s lone innings, the Test is notable in his career for another reason — it is the only one in his career in which no records were maintained for the number of balls he faced in his brief innings. Hence his career Strike Rate (number of runs divided by balls faced) cannot be calculated. It was the first and only such instance in 200-Test career. There were a number of other interesting stats in this Test match: This was the first victory for fledgling captain Mohammad Azharuddin. His previous six Tests, all in New Zealand and England earlier that year, had resulted in two defeats and four draws. When Kapil Dev had Hashan Tillakaratne caught by Ravi Shastri in the second innings, he equalled Ian Botham’s tally of 376 wickets, which at that time was second only to Richard Hadlee’s world record of 431 wickets. Sri Lanka needed just 89 runs to avoid the follow-on after India were dismissed for 288. Yet the visitors crashed to 82 all out in their first innings and scored 198 in the second. This remains the lowest total for India in an innings victory."
Leave me alone,"The Supreme Court has made the right to privacy a fundamental right. So, will it work in letter and spirit? Well-known faces from the region share their take

Jasmine Singh

The Oxford dictionary defines privacy as a state in which one is not observed or disturbed by other people,; now, the word finds an approval from the Supreme Court, which, in a verdict on Thursday, passed the ‘right to privacy’ as a fundamental right. Chief Justice JS Khehar said the ‘right to privacy’ is intrinsic to the ‘right to life’ and is hence a part of Article 21, Part 3, of the Constitution of India. The verdict, though slightly ambiguous in nature, has got thumbs-up from the film fraternity, politicians and from the general public. In a country like ours, where the next-door- aunty keeps a tab on your coming and going out timings, where paparazzi chase celebrities to death, where one can draw hints about your private life from the social media...declaring ‘right to privacy’ as a fundamental right is a praiseworthy step. What needs to be seen now is how it safeguards privacy!

Private life

“Privacy is part of our liberty, part of freedom, which must be respected; it helps people make better decisions and safeguard our family,” shares filmmaker Amit Prasher, who reminds us of the one-line answer that actors and actresses have in response to whom are they dating or if they were seen with someone – ‘It’s my personal life’. “No one has any right to question them or print their personal pictures on social networking sites,” he adds. Amit has raised a valid concern but with celebrities willing to share their personal pictures on social networking sites, it is all a bit chaotic. “Celebrities want to share their pictures all the time and then they want to guard their privacy fiercely,” says Mandy M, singer-actor. Mandy is also of the opinion that the verdict might curtail the loose talk that people do about celebrities on social media; morphing pictures, writing about their personal choices.

Right choice

One of the key conclusions of the judgement is that privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal intimacy, the sanctity of family life, marriage, home, procreation and sexual orientation. Privacy also connotes right to be left alone. Dhananjay Mangalmukhi, first transgender student at Panjab University, draws our attention to this point. “It is my business what I do in my bedroom; whom I stay with, what I wear, is my right. Tomorrow, they can even install cameras in washrooms, which will be total violation of privacy.” Vivek Trivedi, Chandigarh-based social worker, however, has his concerns. “We already have six fundamental rights that are violated on a daily basis. Right to privacy will only hold some value if there is a law backing it, which will allow prosecution, otherwise this will be another fundamental right with exceptions.”""Privacy is part of our liberty, part of freedom, which must be respected; it helps people make better decisions and safeguard our family. ""

""We already have six fundamental rights that are violated on a daily basis. Right to privacy will only hold some value if there is a law backing it, which will allow prosecution, otherwise this will be another fundamental right with exceptions.""

Vivek Trivedi, social worker

Great verdict

""I am truly overwhelmed by the Supreme Court verdict on right to privacy and the parts of the judgement which specifically mention that sexual orientation should be a guaranteed right under the Constitution. This is a big day for the LGBTQ community in India, who have been fighting for their rights for over two decades. This verdict vindicates our appeal for equal rights as citizens of India. I feel truly happy and free.""

Trading with blind faith,"Pramod Kumar

The importance of deras and “religious babas” acts as an active antidote to the frustration caused in neoliberal economy by income stagnation, expanding inequality and rampant unemployment in a highly competitive electoral politics.

Pramod Kumar

INDIA has held 14 Lok Sabha elections and innumerable elections for 29 state assemblies and seven Union Territories on the basis of the Deras and ""religious Babas"" are the poor cousins of religion. They are the schoolmasters of subaltern poor and middle class. They have emerged as messengers between the people and God. Alexis Monteli, as early as in the 18th century, observed, “how in all spheres of social life, the lion's share falls to the middlemen. In the economic domain, e.g., financiers, stock exchange speculators, merchants, shopkeepers skim the cream; in civil matters, the lawyers fleece the clients; in politics, the representative is more important than voters, and in religion, God is pushed into background by the mediator (Godmen).” These mediators of God liberate their devotees from vices like drugs, drunkenness, wife-beating and efficiently deliver subsidised food and give access to health services unlike the inefficient implementation of the government’s social security schemes. If the State’s institutions do not deliver, it is natural for the people to repose faith in those institutions which deliver and bring ""Acchhe Din."" The faith of the devotees in the deras acquires moral superiority as compared to other institutions. The devotees’ faith sweeps them away from the governments, political class, judiciary and even the market. This works to the advantage of self-styled Godmen, even if convicted by the courts, their devotees consider them to be innocent and victims of competing vested interests. The blind faith of these devotees is traded. The devotees are traded as voters, private army, donors of labour, body organs, blood, skills etc. It is their reservoir of power which empowers these Godmen, and makes them acquire a larger-than-life image. The conglomerate of the devotees becomes a clan — they marry amongst themselves (irrespective of their caste, religion or creed), appropriate social capital to acquire jobs and multiply their businesses. Godmen act as arbitrators to facilitate these alliances. This interdependent relationship leaves the political class with no choice but to barter with these Godmen and their followers to garner support in elections. The appeal of these ""Babas"" is a tonic which is embraced by the political leaders. All the political parties try to outcompete each other in wooing the deras. The deras issue a diktat to induce people to vote according to their faith rather than their conscience. The Dera Sacha Sauda exercises influence in around 27 assembly constituencies in Punjab. The deras have made it a practice to venture into the electoral mandi to enhance power. The devotees not only justify their being traded in politics, but consider it empowering. In turn, these deras and religious ""Babas"" are provided a shield against the rule of law to allow them to promote their commercial enterprises and personal leisure. These deras use the political space so acquired to get State patronage and, coupled with the blind faith of their followers, even subvert the rule of law. Blind faith perpetuates ignorance and garnishes it with moral arrogance — thereby making it convenient to overlook the misdeeds of these powerful “Babas.” Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim, head of the Sirsa-based Sacha Sauda is facing a case of rape of two sadhvis, charges of murder of a Dera follower Ranjit Singh and journalist Ram Chander Chattarpati and castration of the followers. Similarly, Baba Ram Pal became a bhajan singer and started his own Kabir Panthi sect. He was charged with murder. When the court issued non-bailable warrants in 2014, his supporters armed themselves with petrol bombs, bottles and stones to resist his arrest. He continues to be in jail. The storm and fury of these followers is demonstrated to pressurise even judicial pronouncements. The institutions of the State are being compromised. Is it only the deras as a vote bank that is enticing or there is something more to it? The importance of deras and ""religious Babas"" acts as an active antidote to the frustration caused in the neoliberal economy by income stagnation, expanding inequality and rampant unemployment in a highly competitive electoral politics. In such a situation, these “religious Babas” emerge as traders of blind faith in a complex neoliberal economy, politics and technologically-driven communication system. These “Babas” use the market-driven mass culture to brainwash their followers, diverting them from real issues and struggles. The use of electronic media, films and social media campaign fill them with false and reactionary views about their social existence. For instance, Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim produced and acted in films to build a larger-than-life image of himself. He produced films like The Messenger 1, Messenger 2, The Warrior Lion Heart, Hind Ka Napak Ko Jawab and Jattu Engineer — all hits at the Box Office. Why do the governments appear to be diffident before these religious bigots? These deras use their appeal to sap the protest of the poor against real sufferings. To put it in the words of Karl Marx, ""religion is…the heart of the heartless world, and the soul of the soulless conditions… To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.” The State, instead of changing these conditions, finds it convenient to blur them and use these deras to garner support in the elections. It is partly natural and hardly unreasonable with widespread distrust in the political system, judicial inefficiency, and market fundamentalism. To hide behind this and justify violations by the “Babas” is a clear case of being blinded by the ""light itself"". However, the question is, to what extent the blind faith in a ""religious Baba"" and uncritical worship of the so-called spiritual power supposedly possessed by them have to be allowed? How long will the State continue to fiddle with the rule of law to flatter the ""Babas"" and their followers. It is the constitutional obligation of the political class, and other institutions responsible for promoting and protecting the rule of law to counter the unreasonable claims of these ""Babas"" which have been accepted blindly by their followers and accommodated by the political class.

The Tribune: Jammu & Kashmir news,"JAMMU/UDHAMPUR: High alert was sounded in Jammu and Udhampur districts on Wednesday night following two reports of suspicious movement in the Miran Sahib area on the outskirts of Jammu city and possibility of infiltration on the Line of Control (LoC) in Rajouri and Poonch districts.

Jammu/Udhampur, August 24

High alert was sounded in Jammu and Udhampur districts on Wednesday night following two reports of suspicious movement in the Miran Sahib area on the outskirts of Jammu city and possibility of infiltration on the Line of Control (LoC) in Rajouri and Poonch districts.

The police, Army and the administration were on their toes throughout the night. As a result, some schools in Jammu and Udhampur remained closed today.

The police in Jammu said searches were conducted during the night in the Miran Sahib area by the Army and the police following reports of suspicious movement.

“Nothing was found during the searches after which the operation was called off. After information of suspicious movement, high alert was sounded but it was called off this morning,” said Sunil Gupta, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Jammu.

A resident of Satwari in Jammu said the Army choppers were making rounds during the night and it did not sound normal.

“A few shopkeepers outside the Satwari cantonment were on Wednesday evening asked to close their shops early,” the resident said.

A red alert was also sounded in Udhampur town by the Northern Command and the police last night, leading to closure of all Army schools and Kendriya Vidyalayas today. Air Force Station, Jammu, school was also closed early, creating panic among parents.

All vital installations, including the Udhampur railway station, Vaishno Devi and Chenani-Nashri tunnel, were put on high alert and security was beefed up. Strict vigil was being kept on the highway and other locations in the district.

“High alert was sounded for security installations at all places in the Jammu zone as a precautionary measure,” said Rayees Ahmed Bhat, SSP, Udhampur.

“(The people are asked to) remain alert and cautious and inform the police in case of any suspicious movement. There is no need to panic. Rumours of terrorists being sighted in Udhampur are baseless and there is no need to pay any attention,” Bhat said.

Sources in the Army confirmed that a red alert was sounded in the area.

“We were told by the higher authorities to sound a red alert. Beyond that we have no information,” said a source.

Another source in the Army said that after the red alert, movement of Army vehicles was restricted and schools were closed as a precautionary measure."
"The Tribune: Health, fitness, medicine","NEW YORK: Consuming daily a fresh avocado, a nutrient-rich, cholesterol-free fruit with naturally good fats, may help boost cognitive function such as working memory and problem-solving skills in older adults, according to new research.

New York

Consuming daily a fresh avocado, a nutrient-rich, cholesterol-free fruit with naturally good fats, may help boost cognitive function such as working memory and problem-solving skills in older adults, according to new research.

The findings showed that adults aged 50 and over who ate one fresh avocado a day for six months experienced a 25 per cent increase in lutein levels in their brain and eyes, which resulted in significant improvment in working memory and problem-solving skills.

Lutein is a carotenoid, or pigment, commonly found in fruits and vegetables that accumulates in the blood, eye and brain and may act as an anti-inflammatory agent and antioxidant.

""The results of this study suggest that the monounsaturated fats, fiber, lutein and other bioactives make avocados particularly effective at enriching neural lutein levels, which may provide benefits for not only eye health, but also for brain health,"" said lead researcher Elizabeth Johnson from the Tufts University in Massachusetts.

Eating avacadoes also showed progressive improvement in other cognitive skills such as memory, processing speed and attention levels.

""Furthermore, the results reveal that lutein levels in the eye more than doubled in subjects that consumed fresh avocados, compared to a supplement. Thus, a balanced diet that includes fresh avocados may be an effective strategy for cognitive health,"" Johnson added, in the paper published in the journal Nutrients.

In a study, researchers from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley reported that avocado seed husks, which are usually discarded along with the seed, contain a plethora of useful chemical compounds.

The study revealed that these chemical compounds could eventually be used to treat a host of debilitating diseases as well as to enhance the allure of cosmetics, perfumes and other consumer goods.

Illegal mining goes on unchecked,"Officials cite lack of infrastructure, manpower for being unable to prevent it

Arteev Sharma

Tribune News Service

Jammu, August 24

Illegal excavation near major rivers continues unimpeded in Jammu and Kashmir with the mining mafia, having full backing of government officials, finding new ways and means to mine sand, gravel and boulders from riverbeds and river banks in broad daylight. This is happening because the state government could not complete the auction for grant of mining lease or quarry licences last year. Thereafter, it granted a “breathing period” to ensure availability of sand and gravel for construction so that the people do not face any inconvenience. The unabated mining has not only been causing huge loss to the state exchequer but also damaged strategic bridges, caused soil erosion and impacted the course of rivers across the state. “It’s a free-for-all in the Kishenpur area. Hundreds of trucks, tractors and mules strip the riverbeds of mineral wealth daily from the unauctioned sites on the Tawi near Kishenpur. Miners use trucks and tractor-trailers to transport sand and gravel without any fear. We are allowed to transport sand and gravel without issuing mandatory royalty payment receipts,” Deepak Kumar, a tractor owner, said. He added, “In return, we pay officials their share. In this way, officials generate a handsome daily income illegally while the state’s coffers remain empty.” An official of the Geology and Mining Department said, “The mining sector has always been controlled by a powerful and influential lobby. Whenever the department made attempts to keep a check on their activity, the lobby scuttled the move by using political clout.” The official said the illegal and uncontrolled extraction of minerals from the Tawi, Ravi and other rivulets had also been causing damage to basements and superstructures of important bridges. Farooq Ahmad Khan, Director, Geology and Mining Department, admitted that the pilferage and leakage in the existing system while citing lack of infrastructure and manpower as the main reasons for it. “The department had notified new rules in 2016 following the Supreme Court guidelines. We started the auction process but it was stayed by the court. Finally, we have got a green signal from the court for the auction and the process has been initiated. We will be going for the auction at the district-level under the supervision of Deputy Commissioners,” Khan said. “The lack of infrastructure and manpower are the reasons for the leakage in the system. The revenue generated for the government could be in the range of 50 to 60 per cent while there was a possibility of 40 per cent leakage,” he said. The Director said the department provided a “breathing period” to the people after the stay on the auction process to ensure that the people did not face any difficulty. “Till July this year, we generated Rs 20 crore as royalty against the expected annual revenue of Rs 60 crore,” he said. Khan said it was not possible to have a round-the-clock supervision. “The odd-hour movement of trucks and tractor-trailers is another problem for us. We are going for the auction of royalty and the process will be completed by September 30 to ensure a foolproof system,” he added."

Even as the Punjab Government has imposed curfew in sensitive areas of 10 districts in the Malwa region as a precautionary measure, it has arranged 200 PRTC buses to ferry the Dera supporters through Punjab on way back to Sirsa, the Dera headquarters.

The Tribune,"NEW YORK: An Indian-origin CEO was racially abused and told to ""go back to India"" and also take along Nikki Haley after he said that he will not support President Donald Trump's economic agenda after the US leader appeared to defend white supremacists following the Virginia violence.

New York, August 23

An Indian-origin CEO was racially abused and told to ""go back to India"" and also take along Nikki Haley after he said that he will not support President Donald Trump's economic agenda after the US leader appeared to defend white supremacists following the Virginia violence.

US-born Ravin Gandhi, 44 founder and CEO of GMM Nonstick Coatings, a global supplier of coatings for cookware and bakeware, wrote an op-ed for CNBC following Trump's Charlottesville remarks but was quickly trolled and racially abused by readers, the Chicago Tribune reported.

. @RavinGandhi1 I am told on a daily basis to go back to India. Like you, I was born here and proud of my roots. Thanks for speaking out. — Ameya Pawar (@Ameya_Pawar_IL) August 22, 2017

""I recently told the New York Times I was 'rooting' for certain aspects of Trump's economic agenda,"" Gandhi wrote in the op-ed.

Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

""After Charlottesville and its aftermath, I will not defend Trump even if the Dow hits 50,000, unemployment goes to 1 per cent, and GDP grows by 7 per cent. Some issues transcend economics, and I will not in good conscience support a president who seems to hate Americans who don't look like him.""

Hundreds of white supremacists clashed with counter demonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville on August 12 in which a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 injured when a car drove into a crowd of protesters. Gandhi was soon bombarded by hate comments on his option piece, including a voicemail from a woman who said Gandhi should ""get your (expletive) garbage and go back to India.""

The woman, using abusive and inappropriate language, told Gandhi that he should also take ""that other half-(expletive) Bangladesh (expletive) with you, Nikki Haley,"" referring to the US envoy to the UN. ""She's (Haley) the one that started all this when she took down the Confederate flag. So don't tell us that you gave him a chance. We don't give a (expletive) who you gave a chance, OK? We're going to start taking down Buddhist statues and see how you and Nikki Haley like that,"" the woman said. In the minute and a half voicemail she said Gandhi should ""go clean up your own (expletive) country, it's a filthy mess.""

Gandhi posted the voicemail to YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and shared some of the nastier emails he received as well, the report said. ""It was obvious that people thought my professional position somewhat protected me,"" he said. ""I wanted to show people that racism is blind to socioeconomics. It just is.""

""Even though my race is a complete non-issue in my day- to-day life, the sad reality is there's a group of racists in the USA that views me as a second-class citizen,"" he said in the report.

""I wanted my peers in the business community, the civic community, my friend community to see that this can happen to me. Because there's this delusion that racism is dead because Obama was elected."" Gandhi added that the fact that Trump ""equated hate groups with those protesting hate lit me up"" as he called Trump's moral leadership on the issue ""reprehensible.""

He said while his sharing a ""bigoted"" voicemail may not make a big difference, but he will speak out against such abuse as long as he has a platform to do so. ""My heroes are Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, people who stood up against insane odds. And let's be honest — I live in doorman-protected building in the Gold Coast. For me to say that I'm suffering in any real sense is insane. But many people in this city who don't have resources really are suffering.""

""I know I'm on the right side of history here,"" he said. ""That's how I sleep at night."" —PTI"
Samsung heir Lee convicted for bribery; jailed for five years,"Seoul, August 25

The billionaire head of South Korea's Samsung Group, Jay Y. Lee, was jailed for five years for bribery on Friday after a six-month trial over a scandal that brought down the president. Follow The Tribune on Facebook ; and Twitter @thetribunechd

Lee had paid bribes in anticipation of favours from then president Park Geun-hye, according to a landmark ruling by a Seoul court, which also found him guilty of hiding assets abroad, embezzlement and perjury.

Lee, the 49-year-old heir to one of the world's biggest corporate empires, has been held since February on charges that he bribed Park to help secure control of a conglomerate that owns Samsung Electronics , the world's leading smartphone and chip maker, and has interests ranging from drugs and home appliances to insurance and hotels.

Lee denied wrongdoing.

One of his lawyers, Song Wu-cheol, said Lee would appeal the lower court ruling.

""The entire verdict is unacceptable,"" Song said, adding that he was confident his client's innocence would be affirmed by a higher court.

Under South Korean law, sentences of more than three years can not be suspended. The five year-sentence is one of the longest prison terms given to a South Korean business leader.

The Seoul Central District Court said Samsung's financial support of entities backed by Park's close friend, Choi Soon-sil, constituted bribery, including 7.2 billion won ($6.4 million) in sponsoring the equestrian career of Choi's daughter.

In return for the contributions, prosecutors say, Samsung sought government support for a controversial 2015 merger of two of its affiliates, which helped Lee tighten his control of the conglomerate.

His lawyers had argued that the merger was done on business merits but the court did not accept that.

'Violation of rights'

Park, who was forced from office in disgrace, is facing her own corruption trial, with a ruling expected later this year.

Prosecutors have argued that Park and Lee two took part in the same act of bribery so Lee's conviction would appear ominous for Park.

Hundreds of rowdy, diehard Park supporters rallied outside the court earlier in the day to demand Lee's acquittal.

""The trials of former President Park Geun-hye and Samsung Jay Y. Lee go hand in hand,"" said Son Tong-sok, 63, who heads a conservative group, holding a Korean flag.

Son said prosecutors had built their cases on circumstantial evidence and unsubstantiated claims reported in the media.

""Arresting these two innocent people are violations of human rights,"" he said.

Samsung, founded in 1938 by Lee's grandfather, is a household name in South Korea and a symbol of the country's dramatic rise from poverty following the 1950-53 Korean War.

But over the years, it has also come to epitomize the cosy ties between politicians and powerful family-controlled business groups - or chaebols - which have been implicated in a series of corruption scandals.

South Koreans, who once applauded the chaebols for catapulting the country into a global economic power, now criticize them for holding back the economy and squeezing smaller businesses.

South Korea's new president, Moon Jae-in, who replaced the Park after a May 9 election, has pledged to rein in the chaebols, empower minority shareholders and end the practice of pardoning corporate tycoons convicted of white-collar crime. —Reuters"
'Very big gap' ahead of Brexit talks: EU official,"Brussels, August 25

Britain and the EU are very far apart on the main issues just days ahead of crunch Brexit talks, EU officials said on Friday, blaming London's ""lack of substance"" for holding up progress. The two sides are due to hold a third round of negotiations next week but the officials were unable to say if they would start on Monday, as widely expected, or Tuesday. The EU insists there has to be ""sufficient progress"" in three key areas — EU citizen rights, Northern Ireland's border and the exit bill — before considering London's demand for talks on its future trade relationship with the bloc. ""If you look where we are and where we need to be... it is a very big gap. It is unlikely that we will make major steps to close this gap"" next week, one of the EU officials told a press briefing. ""It is not the lack of time that is preventing us from advancing, so far it has been the lack of substance,"" added the official who asked not to be named. The EU officials stressed repeatedly that the remaining 27 member states had agreed on the sequencing of the talks and despite London pressing to get the future relationship on the table, that was a no-go for the moment. After the last round in July, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned Britain it had to clarify its position on the initial separation issues if there was to be the ""sufficient progress"" required to turn to trade in October. London has published several position papers in the past few weeks but the EU officials appeared not to be overly impressed. On the future of Northern Ireland and its border with the Republic of Ireland, London suggested technological solutions could avoid it becoming a barrier to both trade and the peace process. ""We see a lot of magical thinking about how an invisible border could work in the future,"" one of the officials said, urging London to really take on board just how big an impact Brexit will have on Ireland's economy and society. The official rejected British suggestions that agreeing a trade deal now would help resolve the issue and warned: ""We think that the peace process must not become a bargaining chip in these negotiations"". In another position paper, Britain said there might be room for the European Court of Justice to have an indirect influence, apparently softening its position that the EU's top court would have any future say at all. But again this would not be good enough, the official said. The rights of more than three million EU citizens in Britain and one million Britons in Europe arose from EU law and therefore come under the remit of the ECJ, they said. ""There is no other possibility,"" one official said. As for Britain's divorce settlement — estimated at up to 100 billion euros in Brussels but much less at 40 billion according to reports in London — the officials said it was not a numbers game but one of agreeing how to work out the bill. ""We have to have a methodology sufficiently detailed so that commitments made to various beneficiaries of the EU budget will be honoured,"" one official said."

There are two types of people in the world — the doers and the rest. Times when Mother Earth is witnessing abnormal climatic conditions and concrete jungles are fast replacing the green cover; some doers are working relentlessly to make things better for themselves, the rest and the rest of the rest. They are the ones who cared to stop by, smelled the roses, ploughed their own fields, then someone else's till their acts became contagious and sparked a movement. Here's to the everyday eco-heroes who refused to be non-participants, who started as one-man armies, faced the heat and still ushered in positive changes. Now in the latter part of their lives, these persons promise to leave the world a greener and finer place.

Jungle all the way

Jagat Singh Chaudhary, a BSF soldier, had just been home on leave in the fall of 1973 when a village woman, out to get fodder, fell down a mountain and sustained fatal injuries. The incident might have been unfortunate in every way, but it wasn't anything new for Kot Malla and many other villages of Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, where trekking to treacherous heights for essentials like water and fodder was part of every woman's daily routine.

The incident kept the young soldier up all night. The rest of his holidays were spent finding ways to improve the plight of the womenfolk of his village. Little did he know that what he would eventually start as an unfeigned attempt to provide respite to his fellow villagers would one day earn him a special name.

Chaudhary decided to grow plants on a wasteland his father owned, which was not just barren, but also uneven and stony. In 1980, he decided to hang up his boots and started cultivating these two barren hectares. Since no water was available in the vicinity, Jagat would walk 3 km daily, carrying water pots on his shoulders. His unbridled enthusiasm was infectious. Many others were inspired to go the ‘Jungli ‘way. Jungli was the name villagers gave the retired soldier.

After turning an unyielding land into a jungle of mixed plants, Jungli started planting cash crops such as ginger, turmeric, pulses, vegetables and herbs, which not only benefited the environment, but also provided livelihood to people.

Suman Saurabh, a Delhi university student, made Jungli’s work the focus of his post-graduation thesis. “There are very few people who're doing the real work. I came to know about Jagat sir from my professor. A visit to his jungle in Rudraprayag was so inspirational that I decided to study it further,” maintains Suman.

In 2007, Chaudhary was invited by HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, to develop a model forest on the campus, which he did till 2010.

He’s been undertaking plantation activities using wood, stone and pit technology. Now 70, ‘Jungli’ says he wants to save the future generations from the ill-effects of environment change; that’s why all the efforts.

Chamba's Chipko campaigner

Sunderlal Bahuguna’s Chipko Movement of 1981 offered meaning and purpose to many people across the country. Though working for the cause of environment since 1973, the movement marked an important event in the life of Kulbhushan Upmanyu of Kamla village in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, who marched from Kashmir to Kohima as part of the movement.

After school, Upmanyu decided to cultivate a piece of land in his village. A small field could not contain this young man’s dream, who refused to turn a blind eye to the problems his fellow villagers faced. Soon, he formed a development group with other villagers in 1973, where they addressed issues of villagers without any government help. He started working towards making the village self-sustainable.

What Bahuguna’s movement gave Upmanyu was a reason to concentrate on forests. He soon became a frontline campaigner in spreading awareness on forest conservation. That time, pine and eucalyptus plantation was under way on a large scale in Himachal, a dangerous practice which was set to jeopardise the ecosystem of the region and put villages in a major fodder crisis. Upmanyu stood up against the destructive move and launched a campaign. His consistent efforts bore fruit and after a seven-year fight, eucalyptus plantation was banned on the government land across the state and pine plantation was majorly discouraged. Owing to his endeavours to protect forests in the years to follow, oaks and rhododendron were declared protected in Himachal.

“It's important to focus on two things — plantation and systematic waste disposal. In plantation, we have to bring in more multi-purpose species and avoid pine and eucalyptus. There's also a need to learn the scientific ways of garbage disposal. The authorities should adopt the European model of waste disposal, which almost eliminates the chances of pollution,” says Upmanyu.

“I have always been interested in forestry. About five-six years ago, I met Upmanyu ji and joined him. He's been working for the preservation of forests for decades and his contribution is inspirational,” says Ranjeet of Chamba.

For many years, Upmanyu has been running an NGO — Himalaya Bachao Samiti. He now usually takes up advocacy work, but that, by no means, stops him from daily escapades into the wild.

The eco-warrior from Marathaland

When Ravi Purandre landed in India after spending the prime years of his life in the Gulf, he threw away his passport to purposely banish the temptation to travel any further.

Besides the warmth and love of his family, returning home to Pune also meant starting anew and finding a job. While still looking for one, he would unpremeditatedly wander off to Hanuman Tekdi — a bleak and lifeless hill, which had long been a haven for gamblers and drunkards.

The year was 1999, the hill was barren and Purandre had an idea whose time had come. He wanted to make Hanuman Tekdi green. He started planting saplings on the hill. Soon he met Srikant Paranjpe, who had already been working in this direction. “Together we started planting saplings and making trenches to harvest rainwater,” says Purandre, as he recalls the onset of the journey.

“One day, I saw NCC cadets practising for the RD parade at the Symbiosis College ground. When you have an unwavering commitment to your work, it's almost impossible not to connect it with everything you see. So yes, I saw these spirited children sweating it out and realised there was little that could match their verve and vibrancy. I wanted to rope in children and bring them to the hill for helping us. But above all, I believed that we, adults, had a responsibility that ran deeper than our subjective goals. It is not only wise, but also indispensable to inculcate regard and respect for nature in our young ones,” he asserts.

Pune schools and colleges, too, realised there was a wide scope for EVS activities at the once insipid Hanuman Tekdi. “We'd have youngsters working, laughing and eating together all day. It never felt like work,” says Purandre.

All along, the facelift of the hill was a matter inspiring enough to pique the curiosity of Pune residents, who now started dotting the hill for their walk.

In 2004, his group started getting support from the Pune Municipal Corporation.

“Moving ahead, we started making coco peat using a shredder, which I, being a mechanical engineer, designed myself. Once crushed, coco peat is used for mulching. It retains moisture like nothing else. A complete waste for the city, coconut shells were a treasure for our plants,” explains an innovative Purandre.

Pune had been facing a problem of leaf litter for a long time. Purandre came to the rescue, yet again. “Two years ago, we created six tonnes of best-quality compost using leaf litter, putting an end to the problem. Our target is to make 30 tonne compost by the end of this year and I am confident that we'll find the first-of- its-kind leaf shredding solution in India,” he asserts.

Eighteen years have passed since Purandre and his team started rainwater harvesting and plantation on the rocky Hanuman Tekdi. Today, the hill is unrecognisable with green cover over 60 acres. Three heart attacks and a bypass surgery has failed to shake Purandre's resolve. Every morning, he walks up the hill, his steps hard to match, while children from nearby schools flock the area to assist him. “Is it work?” It’s not, they know."
