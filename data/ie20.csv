Lack of generosity from spouse drives women to be unfaithful: Survey,"As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue (Source: ThinkStock Images) As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue (Source: ThinkStock Images)

Once the wooing stage is over and the couple has settled down, some men become far less generous and downright stingy. This leads to most women becoming unfaithful to their partners, according to a survey. Gleeden, a European dating site for married individuals, catering to people seeking affairs outside their relationships, conducted a research on 5,000 Indian women users of the dating site who belong to the age group of 23-35 years.

According to the study, married women do not ask to be showered with gifts, but they do appreciate being looked after and valued. As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue.

Most women link infidelity to the lack of generosity from their husbands. Around 69 per cent women think that the lack of sweet words, tenderness, small gestures and initiatives is because their spouse is cheating on them or is in the process.

To explain their own infidelity as a result of their spouse’s ignorant behaviour, 39 per cent of the women members stated that it was their need to feel valued.

Around 29 per cent women admitted their self-esteem is hurt when their spouse does not make sufficient effort. Over a quarter of them declared that stinginess has suppressed their desire for their spouse, and that they consider this defect to be a real romance killer.

“We are delighted to see the increasing number of Indian users in our site and how encounters outside marriage is no more a taboo or something to be shy about in India. In this survey, we have seen what could be the reason for the women to move out from their marital bond to find new encounters,” Solène Paillet, head of communications and a manager at Gleeden, said in a statement.

“The company’s aim is not only to bring members together but to anticipate their expectations and needs and providing them with reliable content, a high-quality interface and many innovative services and I believe, this survey gave us a ray of hope to provide more tempting services to our users,” Paillet added.

Rape Victim narrates ordeal after mother noticed her wearing uniform wrong side out,"(Representational Image) (Representational Image)

A CLASS VIII student, who was allegedly raped while going to attend the Independence Day function at her school, would have kept silent about the crime inflicted on her had it not been for her mother, who noticed that her daughter had worn her school uniform wrong side out and asked her about it.

Only then did the girl tell her mother that she had been sexually assaulted. Sources said the victim, who is said to be extremely traumatised, is now being spoken to by different sets of counsellors from the police and PGIMER.

The suspect, who is yet to be apprehended, is said to be in his 40s. In describing the incident, the girl said he first asked her father’s name, claimed to know him, then dragged her into a nallah where he raped her.

The police have not been able to make any arrest in the case even five days after the crime. The girl was allegedly raped at a nallah situated between her school and Chandigarh Traffic Park at Sector 23 on August 15. On August 16, Chandigarh Police made a sketch following the description provided by the victim.

Four different police teams, including the personnel of crime branch, operations cell and Sector 17 Police Station, were constituted to crack the case but the police are yet to achieve any success.

Florida shooting: Suspect in killings of two police officers arrested at bar,"Two law enforcement officers stand guard outside Osceola Regional Medical Center after two Kissimmee police officers were shot Friday, Aug. 18, 2017, in Kissimmee, Florida. (AP) Two law enforcement officers stand guard outside Osceola Regional Medical Center after two Kissimmee police officers were shot Friday, Aug. 18, 2017, in Kissimmee, Florida. (AP)

A police officer in Florida died from his injuries Saturday, a day after his colleague was killed when a suspect fired at them during a scuffle while they were on patrol. The suspect was later arrested at a bar.

Sgt. Sam Howard died Saturday afternoon at a hospital where he had been taken following Friday night’s attack in Kissimmee, Florida, located south of the theme park hub of Orlando. Officer Matthew Baxter died Friday night, a short time after authorities say he was shot by 45-year-old Everett Miller. Miller faces a charge of first-degree murder for the killing of Baxter. Authorities hadn’t yet said what charges he could face for Howard’s death.

During a patrol late Friday of a neighborhood with a history of drug activity, Baxter was “checking out” three people, including Miller, when the officer got into a scuffle with Miller. Howard, his sergeant, responded as backup, said Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O’Dell. The officers didn’t have an opportunity to return fire. They weren’t wearing body cameras.

Sheriff’s deputies with a neighboring law enforcement agency later tracked Miller down to a bar and approached him. Miller started reaching toward his waistband when the deputies tackled and subdued him, O’Dell said. They found a handgun and revolver on him. “They were extremely brave and heroic actions taken by the deputies,” O’Dell said.

The police chief said Miller was taken to jail wearing Baxter’s handcuffs. Authorities originally said they believed there were four suspects, but the chief said Saturday that no other arrests are anticipated.

Miller, 45, was a Marine veteran and was recently involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation by the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office. The early stages of the investigation show that Miller had made threats to law enforcement on Facebook, O’Dell said.

Baxter, 27, had been with the Kissimmee Police Department for three years. He was married to another Kissimmee police officer and they have four children. Howard, 36, has served with the Kissimmee Police Department for 10 years. He and his wife have one child, O’Dell said. “They are two wonderful men, family men,” O’Dell said. “They are two committed to doing it the right way.”

Separately, two other officers were injured late Friday in Jacksonville, Florida, after police responded to reports of an attempted suicide at a home where the mother of the man’s child, their 19-month-old toddler, the woman’s mother and a family friend were thought to be in danger. One of the officers was shot in both hands and the other was shot in the stomach.

Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Saturday that officers Michael Fox and Kevin Jarrell are in stable condition following Friday night’s confrontation with an armed Derrick Brabham, who was killed by the officers. In Pennsylvania, two state troopers were shot and a suspect killed outside a small-town store south of Pittsburgh on Friday night. In a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, a suspect was fatally shot and an officer injured after they got into a struggle.

President Trump tweeted early Saturday that his thoughts and prayers were with the Kissimmee Police Department. “We are with you!” he said. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted he was “heartbroken” by the attacks on the officers. US Rep. Darren Soto said Saturday that he will ask for American flags to be flown over the U.S. Capitol and he plans to ask for a moment of silence on the floor of the U.S. House to honor the officers.

The officers were fatally shot in a district where the top prosecutor says she will no longer seek the death penalty. State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced earlier this year that she wouldn’t seek the death penalty, explaining it’s not a deterrent and it drags on for years for the victims’ relatives. The announcement came as her office was building a case against Markeith Loyd, who is charged with the fatal shooting of an Orlando Police lieutenant.

Gov. Rick Scott on Saturday evening issued an executive order removing the case from Ayala and reassigning it. “Today, I am using my executive authority to reassign this case to State Attorney Brad King to ensure the victims of last night’s attack and their families receive the justice they deserve,” Scott said in the order. A spokeswoman for Ayala didn’t respond to an email inquiry seeking comment.

"Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: This Rajkummar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon film works in fits and starts","Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast. Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast.

Bareilly Ki Barfi star cast: Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon, Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi, Seema Tripathi

Bareilly Ki Barfi director: Ashwini Iyer Tiwari

Bareilly Ki Barfi rating: 2.5 stars

‘Bareilly ke bazaar mein barfi giri re’. Clearly, the film was made keeping the iconic song in mind, except with an alliterative ‘barfi’ not a ‘jhumka’ in mind.

This Small-Town Rom Com ticks all the boxes going in: perky girl armed with requisite quirky parents, a couple of suitable boys, and great one liners. And it does work in fits and starts, but it flattens equally in between. The thing with dreaming up smart lines, and there are some quite wonderfully flavoursome ones in here, is that sometimes entire scenes get written just to be able to include the punch-lines: this ‘mithai’ has several such sequences, and make the run-time flabby.

One fine day, Bitti Mishra (Sanon) pronounced, quite properly Misra, by the ‘h’ dropping Bareilly-walas, sets her heart on meeting a mysterious someone who seems to know her inside out. Local printing press owner Chirag (Khurrana) is smitten. And then arrives a guy who goes by the name of Pritam Vidrohi (Rao) who is the fly in the ointment. Or is he? Will the new entrant surge ahead? Who will win the fair maiden?

Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast: Tripathi, who’s much too young to play the leading lady’s father, does a good job of being Bitti’s papa, who’s more like a pal than a pa. Pahwa scores another ace after Aankhon Dekhi: what a lovely actress she is.

The two actors who play the best friends, one who accompanies Khurrana, and the other who is seen with Sanon, are pitch perfect. They show up the problems that Sanon has with merging into her part: she tries hard to the be the small-town girl who likes a couple of puffs on the side, and who break dances for fun, but the effort shows.

The plot’s contrivances come in the way of Khurrana’s playing of Chirag fully credibly. As does Rajkummar Rao, who blows away the weaknesses of this film with his consummate act, playing the timid ‘chota shehari’ on the one hand, and the loud ‘rangbaaz’ on the other.

Rao sweetens the pot, and makes up for the rest of it. Almost.

"Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah dropped for Australia Tests; Nasir Hossain back","Nasir Hossain had last featured in a Test in 2015. (Source: AP File) Nasir Hossain had last featured in a Test in 2015. (Source: AP File)

Bangladesh have named their 14-man squad to take on Australia in the two-match Test series with Mominul Haque and Mahmudullah failing to find a place in the squad. Haque has been dropped for the first time since making his Test debut in 2013. Meanwhile there was no place for senior batsman Mahmudullah who was sent back home after the first Test against Sri Lanka earlier this year.

In their place, Bangladesh have recalled allrounder Nasir Hossain who hasn’t played a Test since August 2015 and medium-pacer Shafiul Islam whose last appearance came in October 2016.

Australia arrived in Dhaka under strict security blanket after their previously scheduled tour to Bangladesh was cancelled due to security concerns. More recently, the tour looked to be under threat due to the pay dispute surrounding Australian cricket. However the board and players’ union came to an understanding and a contract was signed to the effect which brought Australia to the sub-continent where they will play India after the Bangladesh series.

The two-match Test series begins on August 27 at Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium. The second Test will be played on September 4 at Chittagong. Before the Test series, Australia are scheduled to play a warm-up match on August 22 and 23.

Squad Mushfiqur Rahim (capt & wk), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Liton Das, Soumya Sarkar, Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Mustafizur Rahman, Taijul Islam, Mehedi Hasan, Taskin Ahmed, Mosaddek Hossain, Nasir Hossain, Shafiul Islam

Virat Kohli continues to top ICC ODI rankings for batsmen,"Virat Kohli has 873 points under his belt. (Source: AP) Virat Kohli has 873 points under his belt. (Source: AP)

India captain Virat Kohli continued to be the world’s top-ranked One-day batsman in the latest ICC ODI rankings, released in Dubai on Friday.

Having 873 points in his kitty, Kohli will have a chance to increase the 12-point lead over second-placed Australian David Warner at the upcoming five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka, starting in Dambulla on Sunday.

Other Indian batsmen in the top-15 are former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (12th), Shikhar Dhawan (13th) and vice-captain Rohit Sharma (14th).

However, no Indian bowler figure in the top-10 list. Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar (13th) is the lone Indian in top 15.

As for the ICC ODI Team Rankings, India are currently at number three and they would have to win the upcoming series at least by a 4-1 margin to ensure that they stay at that position, ahead of England.

At 114 points, India, even if win the series 3-2, will slip to 113 points and behind England on decimal points.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka will by eyeing the chance to seal direct qualification for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 during the upcoming series.

The 1996 World Champions will have to win at least two matches to secure a place in the pinnacle 50-over competition by staving off the challenge from the West Indies.

The cut-off date for direct qualification is September 30. Sri Lanka are placed eighth with 88 points, 10 points more than the West Indies team, which has an unenviable task in its aim of being among the seven top-ranked sides apart from host England to gain direct qualification.

The bottom four sides on the ICC ODI Team Rankings will need to play a qualifying event, also featuring the top four sides from the ICC World Cricket League Championship and top two sides from the ICC World Cricket League.

The top two teams from this event will get to play in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.

Winning two matches will take Sri Lanka to 90 points, while the Windies will at best reach 88 points even if it wins its one-off ODI against Ireland on September 13 as well as all five matches of its series in England from September 19-29.

However, a 4-1 win for India will see Sri Lanka finish at 88 points and the Caribbean side could edge it on decimal points if they win all their upcoming six matches.

The West Indies side will go out of contention if it loses to Ireland as from there it will at best reach 86 points and remain behind Sri Lanka on decimal points, even if Sri Lanka lose 0-5 to India.

Former workers at US-owned miner Freeport Indonesia injured in clash with police,"Police talk with protesting workers of the Indonesian unit of the US mining giant Freeport McMoran Inc during a labour dispute in Timika, Papua, Indonesia August 19, 2017.

REUTERS/Muhammad Yamin

Hundreds of workers laid off by Freeport Indonesia clashed with security forces, injuring three, near the company’s mines in the eastern province of Papua on Saturday, company and union officials said. The Indonesian unit of U.S. mining giant Freeport McMoran Inc. has been embroiled in a labour dispute since May, when around 5,000 workers went on strike to protest against mass layoffs.

Freeport says the layoffs were triggered by unexpected revisions earlier this year in government rules on taxes and royalties. Police on Saturday fired warning shots in the air to disperse the crowd of ex-workers who were demanding their jobs back, blocking roads and setting trucks on fire. Union official Tri Puspital said police then fired into the crowd, injuring three. A national police spokesman declined to comment.

A spokesman for the company said the protests have not had an impact on operations, although employee access to worksites was being affected. “Some of our employee convoys have been cancelled and we will not be scheduling further convoys until the situation is conducive again. We have urged our workers to avoid this area until further notice,” said Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama. The company is a major source of employment and livelihoods in the impoverished eastern-most province of Indonesia.

Rise in number breast of reconstruction surgeries: Women dealing with cancer need not ‘lose’ their breast,"Nikisha Oswal (centre) who battled breast cancer now teaches kids how to dance Nikisha Oswal (centre) who battled breast cancer now teaches kids how to dance

At 23, Nikisha Oswal was engaged to be married and also looking forward to a promising career as a fashion designer. Till breast cancer struck, with at least two doctors — one in Pune and the other from Mumbai — advising removal of a breast. “I was so confused. I didn’t understand much about cancer but losing a breast played heavily on my mind,” Nikisha recalled.

The youngster went through chemotherapy to reduce the lump in her breast and instead of a mastectomy (removal of breast) underwent an oncoplastic breast surgery. Here, the breast is conserved or reconstructed. “It all started with a small lump in my right breast. My hand started hurting and after a check, I was detected with HER2 breast cancer a year ago,” says this former student of Wadia college. “My fiancé broke up with me and all of a sudden life came to a standstill,” she said.

Nikisha soon mustered the courage to tackle the disease. “It was Dr C B Koppiker, breast oncoplastic surgeon, who allayed most of my fears and helped me recover. Importantly, I could conserve my breast,” Nikisha, who now teaches small kids how to dance, said. Like Nikisha, a 30-year-old woman who preferred anonymity, spoke about how she dealt with breast cancer. She too had been advised removal of her breast. “I had just stopped breastfeeding my child and it was a such a shock when one of the doctors said I would have to remove my breast,” she recalled. Dr Koppiker not only operated upon the tumour, the surgical technique was used in such a way that despite the reduction of one breast, the other one was also similarly reconstructed to present an aesthetic look, she said.

At 56, a teacher at an international school in the city was alarmed when she was detected with cancer. “I was eating well, exercising and really felt depressed that I would ‘lose’ my breasts. But I need not have worried as my breasts were aesthetically replaced despite a double mastectomy,” the teacher said on the condition of anonymity.

“With the increase in the incidence of breast cancer, there is a common misconception that treatment means removal of the breast. Nearly 80 per cent of breast cancer patients in the country undergo mastectomy while the remaining undergo breast conservation surgeries with poor cosmetic results,” Dr C B Koppiker, who heads Prashanti Cancer Care Mission, told The Indian Express. However, in the last three years, the oncologist has performed as many as 250 oncoplastic breast surgeries and helped women conserve their breast.

“Mutilating surgeries often lead to loss of self-esteem and depression among women which has been linked to negative impact on the treatment outcome. There is a paucity of trained breast surgeons in the country and at times women are unable to avail of the benefits of such surgeries,” Koppiker, who has set up an international school of oncoplastic surgery in the city, said. While surgeons have been trained in the last three years, Prashanti Cancer Care Mission’s Orchids Breast Health Clinic has tied up with the University of East Anglia, UK, and launched a three-year Masters in Breast Oncoplasty Programme in July this year. “Our first cohort has students from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Indonesia and the faculty will include experts from the UK, the US and India,” Koppiker added.

Scott Hend eyes Presidents Cup audition at Fiji International,"“There is nothing more I would like than to be on a Presidents Cup team this year,” Scott Hend said on Friday. (Source: AP) “There is nothing more I would like than to be on a Presidents Cup team this year,” Scott Hend said on Friday. (Source: AP)

Australia’s Scott Hend put his hand up for Presidents Cup selection after firing a six-under-par 66 to grab a share of the lead after the second round of the Fiji International on Friday.

The 44-year-old, who missed the cut at the PGA Championship, is in a four-way tie on seven-under with New Zealand’s overnight leader Daniel Pearce, South Australian Jason Norris and Malaysia’s Gavin Green at the Natadola Bay Golf Course.

The reigning Asian Tour of Merit winner’s round got off to a flying start when he drained a 70-foot putt for eagle on the par-five first and rolled in three more birdies before the turn.

Hend then added two more birdies on the back nine but missed out on the outright lead after making his only bogey of the round on the 17th at the European Tour event, co-sanctioned with the Asian Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia.

Hend tied for 10th at the recent WGC-Bridgestone event but will need a captain’s pick from Nick Price if he is to represent the International team against the United States at the Presidents Cup in New Jersey from September 28-October 1.

“There is nothing more I would like than to be on a Presidents Cup team this year,” Hend said on Friday. “With that in mind, there are no two ways about it, I have to perform if I don’t perform I won’t get picked.

“There is nothing to hide, there is nothing to be scared about, I want to play in a Presidents Cup and I need to perform.” A good performance in Fiji will not hurt Hend’s chances, particularly with former U.S. Masters champion Mike Weir in the field. Canadian Weir, one of International skipper Price’s assistants, shot a 71 to be one-under, six behind the leaders.

Local favourite and former world number one Vijay Singh, who has been troubled by an elbow injury, was also on one-under after shooting an even-par 72, having grinded through nine consecutive pars after the turn.

Argentina’s twice major champion Angel Cabrera found his groove with four birdies on the back nine to shoot a 69 and be within four of the leaders on three-under.

Today is the last day for White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, a presidential spokesperson said today. The announcement came amid reports that Bannon has been fired by US President Donald Trump.

“White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve’s last day,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

“We are grateful for his service and wish him the best,” Sanders said, thus bringing down the curtains on Bannon, known for his right-wing views, who played a key role in electoral victory of Trump last year.

With this, Bannon became the third high-profile White House official to have been fired in recent weeks. The other two being the White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer.

The White House announcement comes three days after Trump said of Bannon, “I like him, he’s a good man”. He also said that press treats him “very unfairly”.

S Sreesanth moves Kerala High Court for direction to BCCI for NOC to play in Scotland,"S Sreesanth has shared his apprehension that he doesn’t think the BCCI will take a timely decision. S Sreesanth has shared his apprehension that he doesn’t think the BCCI will take a timely decision.

Cricketer S Sreesanth on Friday moved the Kerala High Court seeking its direction to the BCCI to grant a no objection certificate (NOC) to participate in Premier league matches of Glenrothes Cricket Club at Scotland.

In a letter sent to the club on August 10, he said that he had sent a communication to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to issue NOC with immediate effect to enable him play for the club.

Sreesanth has also shared his apprehension that he doesn’t think the BCCI will take a timely decision to grant him the NOC.

In his petition to the HC, the cricketer said, “Without intervention of this court by issuing necessary clarification this petitioner reasonably apprehends that the BCCI may not issue such NOC.”

The premier league will conclude on or before September 9, the petition states.

In a relief to Sreesanth, the Kerala High Court had on August 7 lifted the life ban imposed on him by the BCCI in the wake of the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal.

In his order, Justice A Muhamed Mustaque had also set aside all proceedings against Sreesanth initiated by the BCCI.

"No one had imagined that we will beat Netherlands, says Varun Kumar","India beat the Netherlands twice in their European tour. (Source: Twitter) India beat the Netherlands twice in their European tour. (Source: Twitter)

After a successful European tour, the young Indian brigade said that the tournament helped them learn to handle pressure. With two defeats in the beginning of the tournament against Belgium, India turned the tables in their favour by winning three back to back games which included two against Netherlands.

PTI spoke to forwards Gurjant Singh, Armaan Qureshi, midfielder Nilkanta Sharma, full-back Tirkey, Varun Kumar and goalkeeper Suraj Kerkera who made their debut in the tournament after being a part of last year’s junior World Cup winning team.

Armaan said, “We played together at junior level so our co-ordination was excellent. One has to be mentally and technically strong to perform at this level and victory in three games has given us that boost.”

Varun said that nobody had expected them to win agaisnt a strong team like Netherlands. “No one had imagined that we will beat The Netherlands. It was like a dream for us and we can never forget that moment. It was like a tonic for us which will have long-lasting effect.”

Keeper Suraj accepted that he was nervous in the beginning but gradually adapted to the pressure. “I was nervous in first match but gradually learnt to handle pressure. This tour will play a major role in shaping our careers,” said the Mumbai lad.

Defender Tirkey said that the competition has helped them mature for bigger tournaments later on. “Its good to have healthy competition. We have experienced the difference between playing at junior and senior level and now we will try to minimise the mistakes and become more mature,” he said.

China installs high-definition cameras along Great Wall,"Beijing: Tourists at the Great Wall of China.

China has installed over 300 high-definition cameras along the iconic Great Wall after growing incidents of vandalism, including by foreigners, who scratch their names or messages onto the masonry of one of the world’s seven wonders.

The move is part of a two-pronged approach to tackle the problem which also involves teams patrolling the historic landmark to catch or warn off perpetrators, state-run China Radio International reported. It follows recent publicity after Chinese characters, along with English and Korean words were found on parts of the Great Wall’s popular Badaling section, causing a public outcry, it said. However, the practice is nothing new. NBA player, Bobby Brown, aroused public anger after scribbling his name and number on the Great Wall in October 2016, the report said.

An expert on the Great Wall, Dong Yaohui, says many of the scratches were left by tourists in the 1980s to 1990s when people were less aware of the importance of ancient monument protection, and preventative measures were far from effective.

The newly installed cameras will provide real-time monitoring and provide a record of events as evidence. If anyone is found to be vandalising the wall, they will be banned from visiting again, reported to the police and fined, the report said. Special teams will also patrol daily, with more frequent patrols during peak times. Special signs have been put up warning visitors against climbing on the wall or vandalising the brickwork.

The Great Wall, a symbol of China, is actually not just one wall, but many interconnected walls built between the third century B.C. and the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The existing sections are mainly the Ming wall, which stretches over 8,800 kms, inspiring wonder amongst its millions of visitors each year. “It is a marvellous sight. I wonder how this massive structure was built in the olden times,” said Sunil Kumar, an Indian visitor to the Wall, considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

It was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987. With a total length of more than 21,000 kms (the entire wall with all of its branches), China’s Great Wall runs through 404 counties in 15 provincial regions, with much of it in poor condition due to natural erosion and man-made damage. The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. It was mainly constructed to thwart foreign invasions.

Last year, the Chinese government allocated 700 million yuan (over USD 100 million) to protect the Great Wall over the past two years, according to a top cultural heritage official. Liu Yuzhu, director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH), said that this year his department aims to set up model zones for protection, launch training programmes for protectors and volunteers and establish a national research center for Great Wall protection.

The commander of a US Navy ship that collided with a Philippine-flagged cargo ship off Japan, killing seven American seamen, will be relieved of duty and several other sailors face punishment, a senior admiral said Thursday. Among those being disciplined from the crew of the USS Fitzgerald are its commanding officer, executive officer and senior enlisted sailor, who will all be relieved of their duties aboard the ship, said Admiral Bill Moran, the vice chief of naval operations.

“They will be detached from the ship for cause, which (means) we’ve lost trust and confidence for their ability to lead in those positions and they will not return to the ship,” Moran told reporters.

Seven sailors drowned in their sleeping berth when the USS Fitzgerald collided with the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal in a busy shipping channel off Japan’s coast early on June 17. Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, who heads the Navy’s 7th Fleet, based in Yokosuka, Japan has notified one sailor of his or her punishment and the rest would likely be informed by today. About a dozen sailors are expected to be disciplined in total.

About a dozen sailors are expected to be disciplined in total. “If it’s clear to (Aucoin) that some members of that crew should no longer be doing this line of work, it’s time to move them on, it’s time to take accountability actions,” Moran said.

Moran said the sailors could face further punishments later one, depending on the outcome of various ongoing probes. “I’m not telling they will or they won’t. It’s just we are not done with the investigation,” Moran said.

Aged 19 to 37, the drowned seamen were found by divers in flooded sleeping quarters a day after the collision tore a huge gash in the side of the Fitzgerald. Moran spoke to Pentagon reporters just as the Navy released findings from a preliminary inquiry into what happened in the immediate aftermath of the crash.

Moran spoke to Pentagon reporters just as the Navy released findings from a preliminary inquiry into what happened in the immediate aftermath of the crash. The report found that all seven victims died in the line of duty and their deaths were not due to any misconduct on their part.

Investigators praised the quick-thinking and “heroic” actions of sailors who worked to save shipmates, one of whom had to be dragged from his bunk in a flooding sleeping area as waters quickly rose. One sailor who was rescued moments before he would have drowned reported that “when taking his final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.”

Additionally, the report describes how the ship’s commanding officer was injured when the merchant ship Crystal struck his cabin, trapping him inside. Fellow sailors had to smash and pry his door open before retrieving the commander, who was “hanging from the side of the ship. The officer was eventually medically evacuated by helicopter.

Moran praised the actions of the drowned sailors. The last of them to be buried was laid to rest on Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington.

Rafael Benitez must move players out to sign any more,"Asked about further transfers before the deadline, Rafael Benitez said it would depend on how many players left. (Source: Reuters) Asked about further transfers before the deadline, Rafael Benitez said it would depend on how many players left. (Source: Reuters)

Manager Rafael Benitez takes Newcastle United to Huddersfield Town on Sunday well aware that the Yorkshire club have been busier in the transfer market than his own since both ascended to the Premier League from the Championship in May.

The experienced Benitez has been frustrated not to have secured more players, while Huddersfield, the Championship playoff winners, reaped the benefit of their spending with a stunning 3-0 win away to Crystal Palace on the opening weekend of the season.

“Huddersfield did really well the other day, and it will be a tough game,” Benitez told reporters on Friday. “What I have to do is concentrate on what we can do now, and make sure the players are ready for this game. I think we know how they play and they know how we play.

“If we do well, we’ll have more confidence for the next games.” Despite suffering a 2-0 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur after midfielder Jonjo Shelvey was sent off, Benitez said the players have remained upbeat.

“The mood is positive, the team has been working very hard. They know what is going on. As they say in English, you must walk the walk.”

Newcastle’s army of travelling fans will see a number of changes, as Shelvey is suspended and defenders Florian Lejeune and Paul Dummett were both injured against Spurs.

Two new signings could play – German midfielder Mikel Merino from Borussia Dortmund and Spanish forward Joselu. “You’ve not seen too much of him at Stoke, but he’s played in top leagues,” Benitez said of his countryman Joselu. “He has a lot of potential.”

The former Under-21 international played for Stoke City in the 2015-16 season, scoring four times, and was then loaned to Deportivo La Coruna last season.

Asked about further transfers before the deadline, Benitez said it would depend on how many players left. He added that the rare interview club owner Mike Ashley gave to Sky Sports “didn’t change anything on what I think.”

Malaysia apologises to Indonesia over flag blunder at regional games,"Indonesian Youth and Sports Minister Imam Nahrawi also expressed dismay, posting pictures of the mistake on his Twitter account.

Malaysia has apologised to Indonesia over the upside down printing of the Indonesian flag in a souvenir guidebook handed out at the opening of the Southeast Asian Games.

The mistake, spotted at the opening of the games in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, on Saturday sparked an outcry in Indonesia and the hashtag #ShameonyouMalaysia was trending on social media.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo told reporters in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, the incident concerned “national pride”, and had called for an apology.

Indonesian Youth and Sports Minister Imam Nahrawi also expressed dismay, posting pictures of the mistake on his Twitter account. “It was a good opening ceremony but spoiled by this fatal negligence that was very painful,” he said.

His Malaysian counterpart, Khairy Jamaluddin, tweeted an apology. “There was no malice intended,” Khairy said. Khairy was expected to meet Indonesia’s delegation to formally apologise on Sunday.

Indonesia’s flag has two horizontal bands with red on the top and white underneath. Turning it upside down, makes it look like Poland’s flag. The Malaysian Organising Committee also apologised saying it had been “an inadvertent error”.

The flag blunder was the latest in a series of embarrassing incidents at the regional sports meet. Last week, a bus driver ferrying the Myanmar women’s football team was arrested on suspicion of stealing a watch and for not possessing a driver’s license.

Five books to look forward to in August 2017,"Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon) Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon)

Another month has gone by and a fresh set of books is ready to hit the nearest stands. With an intriguing mix of genres — dominated by non-fiction — August offers simple reading options without the hype that distracts and manipulates readers.

There are no big literary names, no grand book launches for the upcoming books in the coming month. Readers, thus, will have an opportunity to pick titles on the basis of merit and not on the credentials of their authors.

For those looking to focus on more trending issues, we have a couple of political biographies releasing — and, yes, one is on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi. More literary readers may look forward to two anthologies of late writer Khushwant Singh. The list also has a revised biography of Agatha Christie, whose thrillers have once again created a buzz on social media after HarperCollins India released 25 limited facsimile editions of the best books from the Queen of Crime. There are several books focussing on economy and business from Hachette India.

But here are the five books that we can’t wait to read this August:

* The Generation of Rage in Kashmir by David Devadas (Oxford University Press)

This book by a former editor at Business Standard describes the livid experience of Kashmiris who came of age between 2007 and 2017. It shows that Kashmiris generally had high hopes for peace and stability when the militancy, which began in 1988, seemed to be tapering off around 2006 — but alas, that was not to be. It explores the reasons why there was so much angst and rage, which exploded in agitations and stone-pelting in 2008, 2010, and 2016 and why a new militancy is on the rise. The book also traces the decline of hope among the Kashmiris as the situation worsened from a perceived threat to their identity in 2008 to rage over the killing of innocents in 2010. The anger, the author argues, has finally resulted in support for militancy in 2016.

* The Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told by Muhammad Umar Memon (Aleph)

Selected and translated by writer, editor and translator par excellence Muhammad Umar Memon, the 25 stories in this book represent the finest short fiction in Urdu literature. Every story in the anthology illustrates one or the other facet of the form in the Urdu literary tradition. But even more than for their formal technique and inventiveness, these stories have been included because of their power and impact on the reader. Despairing, violent, passionate, humorous, ironic and profound — the fiction in “The Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told” will imprint itself indelibly on your mind.

* Politicshock by Meghnad Desai (Rupa)

In this perceptive account, Meghnad Desai, a Labour Peer in the House of Lords, opens up the debate beyond the West and looks at parallels between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump as two outsiders who broke through the barriers to reach the top. He analyses Asia’s challenge to Western hegemony and asks if the conventional wisdom about the hegemony of free trade liberalism needs re-examination. He peers into the future to look at the greatest challenge facing the world today: Will the Liberal Order survive, collapse or mutate? Is the world at a cusp? Is history — the old saga of blood, sweat and tears — about to resume its course?

* The Epic City: The World on the Streets of Calcutta by Kushanava Choudhury (Bloomsbury)

(Source: Amazon) (Source: Amazon)

A masterful and entirely fresh portrait of great hopes and dashed dreams from a major new literary voice. “Everything that could possibly be wrong with a city was wrong with Calcutta” — and yet, after completing his education in the US, Choudhury embodied his parents’ greatest fears by returning to the city they escaped for a better life. Sifting through the chaos and decay for the stories that are ignored by the papers, that don’t fall into any reporter’s beat, “The Epic City” is a soulful, insightful and meticulously researched account of everyday lives and an extraordinary portrait of a city which is a world unto itself.

* India: Priorities for the Future by Bimal Jalan (Penguin)

(Source: Amazon) (Source: Amazon)

Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Bimal Jalan’s formidable analysis of the last four decades of India’s economic journey illuminates the nation’s transition from a strictly regulated, slow-growth state enterprise to one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Drawing on this vast experience, he compares two distinct periods — 1980-2000 and 2000-15 — to examine the core changes and their significance, and considers their lessons for the immediate future.

Pakistan must ensure that its soil is not used for any terrorist attack against the neighbours, a top American General has said. US Central Command (CENTCOM) commander General Joseph Votel conveyed this to Islamabad during a visit this week. This was his third visit to Pakistan as commander.

During the visit, he called on Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Defence Minister Khurram Dastgir, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Zubair Hayat and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

“In his discussions with Pakistani leaders, he emphasised that all parties must work to ensure that Pakistani soil is not used to plan or conduct terrorist attacks against its neighbours,” the US Embassy here said in a statement.

General Votel also underlined the need to further strengthen US and Pakistani military-to-military relations as the two nations work together to ensure greater regional security and stability. “This visit allowed the General to gain an increased understanding of the counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency efforts the Pakistani government has made over the years to achieve our shared objectives,” the statement said.

Votel called on Prime Minister Abbasi on Friday, during which the premier underscored that Pakistan had an important stake in peace and stability in Afghanistan as Pakistan has suffered the most due to conflict in that country.

Abbasi also raised the Kashmir issue with Votel. He agreed with General Votel on the importance of working closely to address issues of regional concerns.

"Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli power India to nine-wicket win over Sri Lanka in 1st ODI","Shikhar Dhawan celebrates after scoring his 11th ODI hundred. (Source: Reuters) Shikhar Dhawan celebrates after scoring his 11th ODI hundred. (Source: Reuters)

Different day, different clothing but similar result as India, riding on another Shikhar Dhawan’s brutal assault, thump Sri Lanka by nine wickets in the 1st ODI of the five-match series. The Blues replaced the Whites but it had no bearing on the manner in which Dhawan operated in the middle. The left-hander was on the charge from the word go and Rohit Sharma’s early departure, in the fifth over of the chase, didn’t affect his game one bit as he continued to find the fence on regular occasions.

Ever since he has landed in Sri Lanka, Dhawan is yet to put a foot wrong. In the series opener in Dambulla, he elegantly planted his front-foot forward against the seamers Lasith Malinga and Vishwa Fernando, and was very busy while facing the spinners. Lakshan Sandakan had a decent start to his spell when Dhawan misread the length and looked very clumsy when he missed the sweep but that probably was the only occasion when the chinaman disturbed the Delhi dasher.

Post that play and a miss, Dhawan used his feet well and was not afraid to step out on regular intervals. This disturbed the spinner’s rhythm and made him bowl at ordinary lengths which turned out to be easy pickings for an on-song Dhawan. He was fresh from a hundred in the last Test against Sri Lanka and he’s making sure to make the good run count.

Off 71 balls, he scored his fastest hundred in the format and gave the visitors no chance of a fightback in the contest. Just like he successfully did in the first Test. It took him just two sessions to deliver a blow which Sri Lanka couldn’t recover from in the remaining period of the Test. Sunday was no different.

The stand

Rohit Sharma’s early departure – courtesy a lazy run – could have raised Sri Lanka’s hopes of making the contest interesting but Dhawan was in no mood to bat himself in. 36 balls and he brought up his fifty and did the job in fluent fashion with Virat Kohli.

It was one of those rare occasions where Kohli was more of a spectator from the other end. The Indian skipper remained unbeaten on 82 and played a very fluent supporting role to Dhawan. The right-hander gave nothing away and looked very determined to see the side home in the modest chase.

Spin control

Earlier in the day, after put into bat, Sri Lanka were off to a solid start with Niroshan Dickwella, Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis getting off to starts but the hosts lost control in the middle-overs a triggered a slide which they could never recover from.

From 150/2, they collapsed to 187/8 as the lower-order failed to get going. Angelo Mathews remained unbeaten on 36 as the all-rounder got no support from the other end. For the visitors, Axar Patel was pick of the bowlers with figures of 3/34 while Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal and part-timer Kedar Jadhav returned with two wickets each.

"Held for ‘blackmailing’ ex-employee: Four years on, peon acquitted after prosecution fails to prove evidence","The peon, Chandu Ram, was acquitted from the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) Akshdeep Mahajan. The peon, Chandu Ram, was acquitted from the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) Akshdeep Mahajan.

Four years after a peon of the Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board was held by the Chandigarh Vigilance Department for allegedly blackmailing a former employee of the same department, a local court on Friday, acquitted the peon after the prosecution failed to prove the evidences. The peon, Chandu Ram, was acquitted from the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) Akshdeep Mahajan.

During the trial of the case, the complainant could not support his statements given in his complaint. The statements of the complainants did not match with the complaint when he was reportedly cross-questioned by the defense counsel in the court trial which further led to the acquittal of the peon.

According to reports, the Chandigarh Vigilance Department had arrested Chandu Ram in July 2013 for allegedly blackmailing a former employee of the Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Sadhu Singh, a resident of Nayagaon.

As per the complaint, Singh had purchased National Saving Certificates worth Rs 12,000 in the year 2000. He had mentioned then in his complaint that he had kept the National Saving Certificates in a log book but he lost them. He retired in 2006 and later forgot about the certificates. However, six months later, an employee of the organisation approached Singh with photocopies of the certificates and was told to meet a man who had the originals.

The retired official said that when he contacted Chandu Ram, he asked for Rs 20,000 in return for the certificates. Singh in his complaint filed in 2013 stated that he offered him Rs 5,000 as a reward for returning his certificates but he insisted for the money he demanded and was not ready to compromise.

Tired of being harassed, Singh filed a complaint with the MD of the Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board but no action was allegedly taken. Meanwhile, Chandu agreed to return the certificates for Rs 10,000. However, Singh then approached the vigilance department and filed a complaint. Chandu was asked to come to a parking lot in Sector 26,Chandigarh. Vigilance department officials who were waiting there arrested the peon from the spot. He was booked under Section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and Section 384 ( extortion) of the Indian Penal Code.

Spanish police searching for van driver in Barcelona attack,"Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain’s King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain’s King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

Spanish police were on Saturday searching for the driver of a van that ploughed into a crowd in Barcelona, killing 13 people, in one of two deadly attacks in Catalonia carried out by a network of suspected Islamist militants. The van driver has yet to be identified, police in the northeastern Spanish region said late on Friday, but said it seemed increasingly unlikely that he was one of five suspects shot dead in a Catalan seaside resort.

The driver abandoned the van and fled on Thursday after speeding along a section of Las Ramblas, the most famous boulevard in Barcelona, leaving a trail of dead and injured among the crowds of tourists and local residents. Another woman died after a car rammed passersby in the resort town of Cambrils in the early hours of Friday, before police shot dead five attackers who were wearing fake explosive belts and had an axe and knives in the vehicle.

Police have arrested four people in connection with the attacks – three Moroccans and a citizen of Spain’s North African enclave of Melilla. Another three people have been identified but are still at large. Spanish media said two of them may have been killed in Alcanar, where a house was razed by an explosion shortly before midnight on Wednesday, while one suspect, named by El Pais newspaper as Younes Abouyaaqoub, was still sought by police.

Spanish police declined to confirm his identity. They believe the house in Alcanar was being used to plan one or several large-scale attacks in Barcelona, possibly using a large number of butane gas canisters stored there. More than 100 people were injured in the Las Ramblas attack, many of them foreign tourists visiting Barcelona during the peak of the summer season.

In the past 13 months, militants have used vehicles as weapons to kill nearly 130 people in France, Germany, Britain, Sweden and Spain. The Spanish government will decide on Saturday whether to raise its security alert one notch to the maximum level, which could involve armed forces being deployed to help patrol cities and vulnerable areas.

The Mediterranean region of Catalonian is thronged in the summer months with tourists drawn to its beaches and the port city of Barcelona’s museums and tree-lined boulevards. Of the 14 dead in the two attacks, five are Spanish, two are Italians and there is one Portuguese, one Belgian, one Canadian and one U.S. citizen, emergency services and authorities from those countries have confirmed so far.

Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia were due to visit the injured – who are of many different nationalities ranging from France and Germany to Pakistan and the Philippines and are in various Barcelona hospitals – on Saturday.

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar backs Deepa Malik’s name for Khel Ratna,"Deepa Malik had bagged the silver medal in Rio Paralympics in 2016. (Source: AP) Deepa Malik had bagged the silver medal in Rio Paralympics in 2016. (Source: AP)

Rio Paralympics silver-medallist Deepa Malik and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar have requested the Sports Ministry to reconsider her omission from this year’s Khel Ratna award’s list.

In a letter to Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar wrote, “I am of the considered opinion that prestigious Khel Ratna award should be conferred on Deepa Malik. I, therefore, request to you to kindly consider her name for Khel Ratna.”

It may be recalled here that Deepa Malik had spoken to the indinaexpress.com and expressed surprise at her omission. She also revealed that she was heartbroken at the omission while the other three medal-winning para-athletes (of Rio 2016) found a place in the elite list.

“I am sure there was a competent authority there. So am I not defying the committee which has probably come to a conclusion. But I am surprised that despite being the first woman to bag an athletics medal in the Paralympics last year why did they choose to omit me. I am confused and what just happened was not expected. I am sure they must have seen something.” she said,

“I have complete regards and honour for what my fellow athletes have achieved. But why my effort was not considered at par is my question. Is my silver not good enough? I am not questioning the decision but it is heartbreaking. It is not something that I can ask for but I do feel left out on the bandwagon of Rio medallists.”, she further added.

Meanwhile, a member of the selection committee, on condition of anonymity said, “Look, Mariyappan Thangavelu had also won gold in Rio but still not chosen for Khel Ratna, he was given Arjuna. For Jhajharia, it was his second Paralympics gold, we could not ignore him”.

However, it does not seem like the sports ministry will make any further changes. This was after a Sports ministry official said, “We want to stick to what the panel has recommended. We will make public the names of the award winners very soon.”

Meet the Rich,"There is, however, no doubt The Windfall has been written primarily for an American readership. What would be trousers in India become “slacks”. There is, however, no doubt The Windfall has been written primarily for an American readership. What would be trousers in India become “slacks”.

The Windfall

Diksha Basu

Bloomsbury India

304 pages

` 499

The title of Diksha Basu’s eminently readable new novel, The Windfall, is pretty straight-forward. Anil Kumar and Bindu Jha, Mr and Mrs, are your decent, middle-class, East Delhi Uncle and Aunty, professionals, parents, neighbours, likely to register median on most national surveys. That is, until Mr Jha’s homegrown website (simplycall.com) is acquired by an American company for twenty million dollars. Said windfall sends them careening out of their comfortable if quotidian Mayur Palli housing society to a glamorous bungalow in a posh, tree-lined avenue of Gurgaon. The consequences of this almost stratospheric shift become the subject of Basu’s breezy novel-of-manners.

In Mayur Palli, one merely had to compete with the Guptas who drive a Honda Swift, or the Patnaiks who are obsessed with the notion of getting their homely daughter married to Rupak, the Jha offspring, studying towards a business degree in a private college in Ithaca. But, Rupak is failing business school and he also has an American girlfriend to boot. Basu’s Mayur Palli captures, with exactness, the sights and sounds of East Delhi that are familiar to most Delhiwallas.

In Gurgaon, though, one must keep up with the Chopras. Dinesh Chopra has recreated the Sistine Chapel in their family foyer, at great expense. Although he addresses most whims of his family-members — his wife Geeta and “poet” son Johnny — and all fancies of his own, Mr Chopra still can’t keep at bay the uneasy feeling that “relative” to his neighbours, he was becoming poorer. As the Jhas move in next-door, with their Japanese sofa studded with Swarovski crystals and brand new Mercedes, Dinesh Chopra and Anil Kumar Jha soon begin to mirror each other’s acquisitive obsessions, leading to bizarre scenarios.

There are two competent sub-plots. A rather feel-good one involving the changing fortunes of Reema Ray, Mrs Jha’s best friend and neighbour, a young widow who feels suffocated in Mayur Palli; and, a more nuanced one about Rupak, who is torn between his parents’ changing class-status – middle-class or newly rich? – and two women, one Indian and one American.

There is, however, no doubt The Windfall has been written primarily for an American readership. What would be trousers in India become “slacks”. Even more problematically, Gurgaon, that steaming city with a monster’s breath and gilded eyes, where extreme affluence and urban poverty exist cheek by jowl, becomes a “monolith” in Basu’s world — all quiet, tree-lined, “an oasis of calm” as it were. Something that an American audience would equate with affluent suburbs of New York City, perhaps? In Westchester County or Scarsdale? The real Gurgaon, of course, is no oasis of calm. Neither is it exclusively for the rich. Indeed, it was after Mayur Vihar and its obverse in the south, Vasant Kunj, became well-nigh impossible to afford, that a large chunk of the middle-classes escaped to the high-rise apartments of Gurgaon that they could afford on EMIs, so much so that these too, in due course, became “aspirational”.

It is, of course, heartening to see a novel of this sort, gentle humour, honest story-telling, and a clever Candace Bushnell-like pulse on contemporary trends (albeit without any Candace Bushnellian emphasis on sex) do so well in the US, given it has nothing whatsoever to do with caste, terrorism or atrocities on women, the usual favoured memes. One breathes a sigh of relief as it were to see that immigrants and exotic locations are no longer what sell. However, the attendant points this raises is rather troubling. Had this novel been published only in India, it would have disappeared from the mid-list before you finished saying windfall, perhaps even unreviewed in newspapers or magazines. Must (windfalls in) Indian writing in English come to India via an MFA degree and a global (read American) launch to be read at all? What does that say about the state of the industry in India at large?

Downbeat Rafa Benitez in the dark about Newcastle United signings,"Rafa Benitez rued Newcastle United’s lack of activity in the transfer market. (Source: Reuters) Rafa Benitez rued Newcastle United’s lack of activity in the transfer market. (Source: Reuters)

Newcastle United manager Rafael Benitez offered little hope to the club’s fans after a second straight loss in the Premier League, having made no secret of his disappointment at the club’s failure to make significant moves in the transfer market.

Newcastle fell to a 1-0 defeat at Huddersfield Town on Sunday in a meeting of two promoted clubs, having also lost at home to Tottenham Hotspur last week.

While Huddersfield are clearly riding the wave of their promotion through the playoffs, Newcastle who won the second tier Championship last season, finishing 13 points ahead of the Yorkshire club, appear to have none of that buzz.

“It was a long time ago,” was all Spaniard Benitez would say when asked if the momentum of promotion had been lost.

In the build up to the game he had talked, yet again, about his unhappiness with the club’s lack of activity in the transfer market.

It has been the issue that has surrounded United’s return to the top flight and their lack of invention and craft against David Wagner’s side served only to emphasise even further their need for some new additions.

Asked directly if that game had highlighted that requirement, Benitez replied: “I don’t know,” and he offered little extra when pushed.

“No news. I haven’t read the newspapers, we will have to wait. Obviously we are working behind the scenes trying to do things but I don’t know what our position is at the moment,” he said.

The club’s former striker Alan Shearer had tweeted after the match that on the evidence of the first two games it was going to be a long, hard season for Newcastle.

Benitez did not disagree but said he felt there would be an improvement as his team got used to playing in the top flight again and that they would be good enough to survive.

“Hopefully yes because I think we will improve… we will need time but we will improve,” he said.

“We have to keep working as hard as we did today and to play better if we can. It is something we have to learn every week,” he added.

The former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager spoke with little enthusiasm and asked about his mood had another short response: “I’m not happy because we have lost two games.”

"Barcelona terror attack: 13 killed, several injured; Islamic State claims responsibility","An injured person is carried in Barcelona, Spain, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017, after a white van jumped the sidewalk in the historic Las Ramblas district, crashing into a summer crowd of residents and tourists and injuring several people, police said.

(AP Photo/Oriol Duran)

A van on Thursday mowed through crowds of tourists on Barcelona’s Las Ramblas district, killing at least thirteen people, Reuters reported. The van had swerved off the sidewalk into an area near the Las Ramblas avenue, a popular tourist district of the city usually crowded with foreigners who frequent the bars and shops on the stretch of this historical market area.

“We can confirm there are 13 dead and more than 50 injured,” regional interior minister Joaquim Forn said on Twitter. Police confirmed the arrest of two men behind the incident, news agency AP said. One of the suspects was named by the police union as Driss Oukabir.

The attack was later claimed by Islamic State. Carles Puigdemont, the head of the Spanish region of Catalonia said that at least 80 people had been taken to hospital. According to a US monitor, the jihadist organisation’s propaganda outlet Amaq said, “The executors of the Barcelona attack were soldiers of the Islamic State.”

US President Donald Trump condemned the attack. He took to twitter and said that he will take necessary actions. He tweeted, “The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help.”

France’s President Emmanuel Macron called it a “tragic attack”. British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Twitter that London “stands with Spain against terror”.

News agency AFP quoted an eye witness saying, “There were bodies on the ground with people crowding round them. People were crying. There were lots of foreigners.” Another eye witness told Britain’s Sky News television, “All of a sudden, I just sort of heard a crashing noise and the whole street just started to run, screaming. I saw a woman right next to me screaming for her kids.”

Earlier, the Islamic State also claimed the Nice attack and also the 2015 Paris attack on the night club. Not only this, IS also claimed another deadly vehicle attack in December in which 12 people were killed when a man driving a truck ploughed into a crowd at a Berlin Christmas market.

Across the aisle: India at 70 – The Economy (continued),"The RBI’s monetary policy statement has confirmed many of the conclusions. The RBI’s monetary policy statement has confirmed many of the conclusions.

I am happy to read well-reasoned articles on India at 70 and particularly about the state of the economy. In my interactions with people, village folk and town folk, I find that there is growing interest in matters like prices, jobs and infrastructure. At political rallies, I find that people don’t pay much attention to political stump speeches or party-bashing or name-calling. They listen keenly to speeches about unfulfilled election promises; prices of farm produce, fuel and transport; jobs; the infrastructure deficit; education loans; and so on. Hence, I decided to stay this week with the subject of ‘Economy’.

There is ample officially blessed material on the state of the economy. There are the Economic Survey, Volume 2 (ES) and the RBI’s Monetary Policy Statement of August 2, 2017.

My dashboard last week had five metrics or measures on the health of the economy.

Jobless and Slow Growth

The first metric was JOBS. The ES has no separate section on jobs, only a two-page write-up on ‘Employment and Skill Development’. The ES has given no numbers on the jobs created, except a claim that among those who received skill training, 4,27,470 persons were given employment! Nothing is mentioned about states or sectors which have created the 4,27,470 jobs. Nothing has been said about the number of jobs likely to be created in 2017-2019. The silence on the most challenging issue tells the truth: India is witnessing moderate, but jobless, growth.

The second metric was GDP GROWTH. The ES admits that GDP growth declined from 8 per cent in 2015-16 to 7.1 per cent in 2016-17. It also admits that growth in the first half of 2016-17 was 7.7 per cent and 6.5 per cent in the second half. The decline, therefore, is from a rate of growth of 8 per cent to 6.5 per cent — exactly what I had predicted would be the impact of demonetisation. The Gross Value Addition (GVA) numbers are worse: in Q4 of 2016-17 it was 5.6 per cent. Going forward, the ES warns “sustaining current growth trajectory (read 6.5 per cent) will require action on more normal drivers of growth such as (private) investment and exports and cleaning up of balance sheets to facilitate credit growth”.

Declining Graphs

The third measure was INVESTMENT: In two startling graphs (Figures 47 and 48), the ES presents a depressing picture of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Growth in Public GFCF has been on the decline since Q2 of 2015-16. Growth in Private GFCF has also been on the decline since the same time and entered negative territory in Q4 of 2015-16 where it remained through 2016-17. The forecast is even more depressing: “The investment spending of the general government, relative to GDP, is likely to decline in 2017-18 as per available Budget information.”

The fourth metric was CREDIT GROWTH: I need say no more than quote from the ES: “The high growth observed in the 2003-08 period was accompanied by a surge in credit growth, which usually exceeded the 20 per cent mark year on year. After being impacted sharply by the global financial crisis and the fiscal stimuli over the period 2008-10, credit growth remained around the 15 per cent mark till February 2014. Subsequently, it has slowed down. During 2016-17, gross bank credit outstanding grew at around 7 per cent on an average. The latest reading for May 2017 is 4.1 per cent.” Non-food credit growth as a whole as well as credit growth to agriculture, industry, services and personal loans have been on the decline since September 2016. The worst affected is ‘industry’ where credit growth has been negative since September 2016. Public sector banks’ credit to industry has been negative since March 2016; it is only private banks that are giving some credit to industry.

The fifth measure was INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION: According to the ES, “industrial performance has declined from 8.8 per cent during 2015-16 to 5.6 per cent in 2016-17.” The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) numbers are confusing. Going by the old series (base year 2004-05), the growth rate of IIP has improved from 0.7 per cent in Q1 to 1.9 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17. However, under the new series (base year 2011-12), the growth rate has declined in 2016-17 from 7.8 per cent in Q1 to 2.9 per cent in Q4! The new series numbers, although on a declining curve, are still better than the old series numbers! The new series numbers present a flattering picture which one may believe at one’s own risk!

Also read | Across the Aisle: India at 70 – The Economy

Given Up on 2019

The RBI’s monetary policy statement has confirmed many of the conclusions. According to the RBI, business sentiment reflects expectations of moderation of activity in Q2 of 2017-18 (read slower growth). Industrial performance has weakened and there is output contraction in consumer durables and capital goods (read declining industrial production). The number of new investment announcements fell to a 12-year low in Q1 of 2016-17 and high levels of stress in twin balance sheets — banks and corporations — are likely to deter new investment, and states may cut back on capital expenditure (read sluggish investment). The statement was silent on jobs and credit growth.

As I had feared, we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of Independence without joy. I am afraid the government fears looking at the dashboard. It seems to have given up on achhe din by 2019 and is busy polishing the rhetoric of a New India in 2022!

Delhi Police say probing ‘Blue Whale’ link to teen suicide bid,"Blue Whale: A reported suicide game (Source: Twitter) Blue Whale: A reported suicide game (Source: Twitter)

Days after a 16-year-old boy jumped off the fourth floor of a building in northwest Delhi’s Ashok Vihar, police are investigating whether this is Delhi’s first case of ‘Blue Whale Challenge’ and have taken his phone into their possession. With the teenager being treated at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and unable to give a statement, police haven’t been able to rule out any connection to the challenge. DCP (northwest) Milind Dumbere maintained that “nothing about the ‘Blue Whale Challenge’ has come out as of now”.

“We have taken the boy’s mobile phone for investigation. The handset is password protected and we are trying to unlock it,” he said. Dumbere added, “The boy was upset as he had changed schools in March and was trying to adjust to the new environment. We are looking into every angle.” The incident took place on August 16 when the boy went to the terrace and jumped off the four-storey building at his east Delhi residence, police said. A security guard saw him lying on the ground and informed his mother, who was at home. They rushed him to a nearby hospital, from where he was shifted to Fortis Hospital. “We have recorded statements of eyewitnesses who saw him jumping off the building. Before he jumped, he left his mobile phone, spectacles and his bathroom slippers,” an officer said.

His neighbour and friend Sanjam (18) said the suicide attempt left everyone shocked. “He used to regularly play with us, but for the past few days he had not been coming out of the house,” he said. According to a doctor, the boy had to undergo surgery as he sustained severe head injuries. He is still critical and has been kept under observation, the doctor added.

When Huma Qureshi gave us style inspiration in a beautiful plaid dress,"Huma Qureshi in a Vidhi Wadhwani creation. (Source: Instagram/iamhumaq) Huma Qureshi in a Vidhi Wadhwani creation. (Source: Instagram/iamhumaq)

Huma Qureshi might not always be a hot favourite of fashion enthusiasts, but this talented is actor is known for cutting a fine figure from time to time. We remember a few memorable looks where she looked drop-dead gorgeous. Our favourite is of the actor in a bright, cheery cold-shoulder yellow dress from Asos which she wore with a pair of fuschia pink earrings from Crimson. She also made quite an impact in a hi-low sleeveless dress and a light lemon yellow floor-length jacket from Ritika Mirchandani.

Now, the actor is back to make your hearts skip a beat in a lovely plaid number during the promotion of her upcoming film Partition 1947. Celebrity stylist Sanjana Batra picked up this asymmetrical dress from Vidhi Wadhwani and we are glad she did.

The off-shoulder bow sleeves with the soft sweetheart neckline gives it a feminine touch and the sharp silhouette gives it a nice edge. We like how she styled it with clear strap heels from Intoto, even though we would have preferred a plain black strappy pair.

The sideswept hairdo by celebrity hairstylist Sana Pathan looks gorgeous on Qureshi and her make-up by celebrity make-up artist Ajay Vishwasrao gives her ta beautiful glow. She looks lovely, won’t you agree?

There’s another outfit which we like a lot and we think the Jolly LLB 2 actor looks really elegant in it. The simple black maxi isn’t anything extraordinary but paired with the patterned blue longlayered cape, it looks wonderful on her.

Celebrity stylist Sanjana Batra who styled her picked it up from Ritu Kumar and accessorised it well with Amrapali Jewels and Aquamarine Jewellery. Poker straight hair, smokey eyes, and a soft pink pout accentuates her beauty.

Which look do you like the most? Let us know in the comments below.

Blaise Matuidi completes move from PSG to Juventus,"PSG did not say how long Matuidi’s contract is with Juventus. (Source: Reuters) PSG did not say how long Matuidi’s contract is with Juventus. (Source: Reuters)

France midfielder Blaise Matuidi completed his move from Paris Saint-Germain to Juventus on Friday. Matuidi arrived in Turin for a medical on Wednesday but the move finally went through Friday, PSG said in a statement.

No financial details were given, but Juventus will reportedly pay PSG 20 million euros ($23 million) plus bonuses for the player, who had a year left on his contract. PSG did not say how long Matuidi’s contract is with the Italian champion.

The French club, runner-up to Monaco last year, is trying to balance the books after buying Neymar for 222 million euros ($261 million) and could not afford to lose Matuidi on a free transfer.

Matuidi scored 22 goals in 295 games for PSG in all competitions after joining from Saint-Etienne in 2011.

After a difficult first season, he quickly became an integral part of the team for successive managers, Carlo Ancelotti and Laurent Blanc. He flourished from a largely defensive midfielder to a robust, tireless runner with an eye for goal and an enormous work-rate.

Overcoming some technical deficiencies in his game, Matuidi gradually earned himself a place in the France lineup and became a key player at the 2014 World Cup and last year’s European Championship. He has made 58 appearances for France, scoring eight times.

At the beginning of last season, after Blanc was fired and replaced by Unai Emery, Matuidi expressed a desire to leave PSG and wanted to join Juventus. But the club blocked his move, considering him too important to leave.

In all, Matuidi won four league titles, three French Cups and four League Cups with PSG.

Cow deaths: Congress demands removal of Chhattisgarh Animal Husbandry minister,"Nearly 173 cows died in about one week at three shelter homes in Chhattisgarh following which nine officials, including two deputy directors, of the state’s animal husbandry department have been suspended. Nearly 173 cows died in about one week at three shelter homes in Chhattisgarh following which nine officials, including two deputy directors, of the state’s animal husbandry department have been suspended.

The Congress on Sunday demanded sacking of Chhattisgarh Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Minister Brijmohan Agarwal over the death of about 173 cows in the government-aided cowsheds in Durg and Bemetara districts. Congress state unit chief Bhupesh Baghel alleged that despite sanctioning grants to the tune of crores to cow shelter homes, it is in pathetic condition across the state.

“It clearly reflects the corruption on the part of the (animal husbandry) department and Gau Sewa Ayog officials. Funds being given for maintenance of Gaushala were being siphoned off by the department officials in nexus with the facility owners.

“Neither the inspection of cow shelter homes nor the auditing of the funds sanctioned to them was being done due to kickbacks. Over 200 cows alone died of starvation and thirst at the cowshed ran by BJP leader Harish Verma in Rajpur which had received lakhs of rupees by means of grant for its maintenance. The cattle became victims of kickbacks,” Baghel alleged.

He said that mere suspension of some officials over cow deaths would not serve the purpose. “Chief Minister Raman Singh should immediately sack minister Agrawal and the chairman of the state’s Gau Sewa Ayog from their posts,” the Congress leader demanded. Baghel questioned why the RSS and the BJP were silent over the death of cows in Bemetara and Durg.

“The BJP and RSS workers have been involved in lynching innocent people in the name of cow protection. But now in the Chhattisgarh’s case, why the RSS and BJP leaders have kept themselves mum,” he said. Congress leaders and workers today took out a march in Rajpur area demanding strict punishment to the guilty in cow deaths incident.

On August 28, a massive protest will be staged in Bemetara on several issues, including deaths of cows, alleged lathicharge on villagers when they were demanding strict punishment against rape accused in Berla and others, he said. Later, on August 30, the Congress will stage gherao at the Chief Minister’s residence here while taking stray cows along with them, he added.

Nearly 173 cows died in about one week at three shelter homes in Chhattisgarh following which nine officials, including two deputy directors, of the state’s animal husbandry department have been suspended.

"Garbine Muguruza, Grigor Dimitrov reach first Cincinnati finals","Garbine Muguruza defeated Karolina Pliskova 6-3, 6-2 in semi-final. (Source: USA Today Sports) Garbine Muguruza defeated Karolina Pliskova 6-3, 6-2 in semi-final. (Source: USA Today Sports)

Garbine Muguruza reached her first Western & Southern Open final with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over defending champion Karolina Pliskova on Saturday.

Grigor Dimitrov also will be playing in his first W&S final after outlasting John Isner 7-6 (4), 7-6 (10) in the first men’s semifinal.

Muguraza, the Wimbledon champion, will meet the winner of the later semifinal between Simona Halep and Sloane Stephens.

The final Sunday will be the first on American soil for Muguruza, who lost to Pliskova in last year’s W&S semifinals. The Spaniard had lost six straight matches against Pliskova since winning their first in 2013.

“I was very precise with my shots,” Muguruza said. “I wanted to be more aggressive and take my shots. I felt pretty good out there – under control. Everything went my way.”

Muguruza won when the top-ranked Pliskova sailed a forehand long on the fifth match point. Pliskova, who played part of one match and all of another Friday after rain forced postponements Thursday, had 28 unforced errors to Muguruza’s 13.

Muguruza was coming off playing the tournament’s longest match, a 2-hour, 45-minute three-set win over Svetlana Kuznetsova on Friday. That followed a 2-hour, 18-minute win over Madison Keys on Thursday, when she fought off three match points.

“I don’t think I played my best tennis today,” Pliskova said. “I think the energy was pretty low from my side. Obviously, a tough schedule for me the last two days _ three matches in about not even 24 hours.

“I think she played very solid, not missing much and obviously serving well. Everything started, I think, in the first game of the first set.”

Muguruza took charge early, breaking Pliskova in the first and last games of the first set. She gained a second-set edge with a backhand winner on break point for a 4-2 lead before closing it out in 1 hour, 19 minutes.

The 11th-ranked Dimitrov, who lost in the last year’s semifinal to eventual champion Marin Cilic, had just one double fault and finished with nine unforced errors to No. 19 Isner’s 28 in the 2-hour, 3-minute match. The Bulgarian will play the winner of the semifinal between Nick Kyrgios, who knocked out second-ranked Rafael Nadal in straight sets in a Friday quarterfinal, and David Ferrer.

"With betting and $200K for winner, online World Cup pays","Ahmed Al-Meghessib won’t be lining up alongside Neymar, but the 19-year-old Qatari is no less a soccer pioneer. (Source: AP) Ahmed Al-Meghessib won’t be lining up alongside Neymar, but the 19-year-old Qatari is no less a soccer pioneer. (Source: AP)

In the days after Neymar’s world-record transfer, Paris Saint-Germain was wrapping up another ground-breaking signing. One less costly and lacking the Brazilian’s fanfare. Ahmed Al-Meghessib won’t be lining up alongside Neymar, but the 19-year-old Qatari is no less a soccer pioneer.

Unlike the other 31 console competitors at the FIFA Interactive World Cup in London this week, Al-Meghessib still pulls on his boots for a top-flight club, in his native Qatar with Al-Duhail. “I am a real football player,” he says. “It is a great feeling to be a virtual and an actual football player.”

Unfortunately for Al-Meghessib, whose gaming name is “AMEGHESSIB,” he couldn’t transfer his talent for real football into a deep run in the virtual finals. He finished in the middle of his group in the first round and advanced no further. It was the same fate for the second gamer signed by PSG in its first esports squad. And yet, PSG could consider them a relative success.

Professional teams are no longer just focused on winning competitions like the Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup on the field. They want gaming titles to tap into a slice of the growing esports market, and bring a new generation of fans into clubs. Of the 32 men who made the finals in London no women qualified 11 were attached to clubs, according to FIFA.

Those other clubs included Ajax, Roma, Wolfsburg, and FC Basel. They take any reflected glory at the Interactive World Cup from their players, whom they really sign for other tournaments, where they can field their club colors.

Al-Meghessib was told off for setting up his team as PSG after his opening match in a choking, sweaty room surrounded by seven other head-to-heads and loud commentary. His team had to wear a neutral kit instead in future games. Al-Meghessib was a success even before his opening match in London.

Competition to reach the finals is getting harder each year. Two million players entered the 2016 edition. Qualifying for the 13th tournament attracted seven million competitors, according to FIFA, and the finals were broadcast globally online and on television. Just like the men’s World Cup 51 years ago at Wembley Stadium in London, FIFA’s virtual tournament culminated in an England-Germany final in front of an audience at Central Hall Westminster on Friday.

Just like in 1966 an Englishman collected the trophy and with it $200,000 for Spencer “GORILLA” Ealing , who beat Kai “DETO” Wollin . “It’s life-changing money at stake now,” says the 28-year-old Wollin, who still took home $40,000 despite losing 7-3 in the two-leg final, one on his preferred PlayStation and the other on Ealing’s favored Xbox.

FIFA has increased the jackpot for its gaming champion ten-fold since last year’s $20,000 prize in New York, an investment reflecting the growing importance of esports even to the world’s most popular traditional sport.

“We’re not in it for the money,” says Jean-Francois Pathy, director of marketing services at FIFA. “The priority of this event is to engage with the younger community. It’s just another way of consuming football.”

The Interactive World Cup produces the unusual sight of stars like Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Lionel Messi (Argentina) and Neymar (Brazil) wearing the jerseys of other countries. There are also long-retired players also available for selection like Ruud Gullit, who scored for Ealing’s winning England team.

“Thanks to this game the youngsters know me because I’m in the legends game,” says Gullit, a title winner with AC Milan, Feyenoord, PSV Eindhoven and the Netherlands. “Not being raised on egames, it’s new for us … we have to deal with it.”

The EA Sports-produced FIFA game already seems to be the preferred recreational activity for players worldwide, whether to fill the tedium after training or while lounging around hotels on team trips.

“Every year when the game comes out, the first thing I do is check my stats,” Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta says after handing out the jerseys for the FIFA gamers in London.

Bookmakers are getting into virtual soccer, too, with in-play betting available. “It’s crazy when you can see (people) spending money on me winning,” Wollin says. More than 30 bookmakers are being fed information by Bulgaria-based UltraPlay. Just like in regular soccer there is scouting, with experts logging old games and practice matches online to assess odds.

“We are literally following every single player whether they are playing at home or streaming,” Peter Ivanov, UltraPlay head of the eSports trading, says by telephone. “It works in the same way as any other football game, making sure each game is fair to the public so it is OK to take bets on it.”

But as the financial stakes rise for players, so do the temptations: Match-fixing, cheating, corruption. Ian Smith, integrity commissioner at the Esports Integrity Coalition, thinks it is “foolish” to be offering extensive betting on virtual soccer due to the lack of data available to provide reliable markets.

“The risk is sitting all with the operators on this,” said Smith, who has been in talks with EA about introducing integrity programs and education for players. But, he adds, soccer games represent only around three percent of the esports market.

“There’s less incentive to fix a match because the match is small,” Smith says. “If FIFA takes off as an esport then of course integrity is going to become an issue.” Performance-enhancing substances could also become an issue, with players not currently tested.

“I know that in other esports people take some drugs to boost their concentration,” Al-Meghessib’s Brazilian teammate, Rafael Fortes, says. Preserving the integrity of virtual soccer is particularly important for the governing body since the game is the one part of the FIFA brand yet to be infected by corruption scandals. FIFA is cautious but not immediately troubled by the prospect of video gamers trying to cheat like real footballers.

“We are keeping an eye on it,” Pathy says. “It could come with challenges in the future. But we feel by being close to our players, their agents and the clubs we are minimizing this risk.”

Those players are helping to dispel a stereotype, articulated by Gullit, that gaming is about “geeks at home.” For youngsters, the professional gamers who master strategy, formations and tactics on consoles are becoming heroes like professionals on the pitch as they grow social media followings.

“Take my son as an example,” Pathy says. “He knows more about football through playing the EA FIFA game than actually watching on TV.” Al-Meghessib is hoping to feature in the game one day as a Qatari national team player, by competing at FIFA’s real World Cup in his homeland rather than just in the digital version.

From London, after pocketing $1,000 for his group-stage exit, Al-Meghessib was flying to Slovenia for a training camp to resume his playing career for real on grass. “My goal now is to be in the squad in 2022,” he says.

Fortes will have to settle with making esports pay. “I didn’t have the talent to be a regular pitch player,” the 22-year-old Fortes says. “Your family don’t expect if you play video games in your room and you get good that you can make money out of it.”

"Ryan Armour, Webb Simpson share second-round lead in Wyndham Championship","Webb Simpson, a North Carolina native who won here in 2011, put himself in position to contend for his first victory since 2014. (Source: AP) Webb Simpson, a North Carolina native who won here in 2011, put himself in position to contend for his first victory since 2014. (Source: AP)

Ryan Armour shot a career-best 9-under 61 on Friday for a share of the lead with Webb Simpson after two rounds at the Wyndham Championship.

Armour and Simpson were at 13-under 127 halfway through the PGA Tour’s final event of the regular season. Simpson shot a 64. Henrik Stenson was a stroke behind them after a 66. Ollie Schniederjans and Vaughn Taylor and were 11. Schniederjans shot 63, Taylor had a 66.

First-round leader Matt Every followed his 61 with a 72 to slip six strokes off the lead. The field at Sedgefield Country Club is once again full of players trying to force their way off the bubble and qualify for the postseason. The top 125 players on the points list earn berths at The Northern Trust next week in New York.

At No. 187 on the list, Armour isn’t even close to the bubble. “Could turn your life around,” Armour said. “I had some goals at the beginning of the week. I knew where I stood and, you know, right now the goals are attainable.”

The 41-year-old who has yet to win on tour and has bounced between the big tour and the Web.com Tour throughout his 14-year professional career, had nine birdies five on his first nine holes, then four in a row on Nos. 5-8 to quickly climb the leaderboard.

His round was two strokes better than his previous best of 63 nine years ago in Milwaukee. Simpson, a North Carolina native who won here in 2011 and named his third child Wyndham, put himself in position to contend for his first victory since 2014.

He had four birdies on the first six holes of his back nine, pulling even with Armour at 13 under after his birdie on the par-5 15th.

“Keep making birdies, stay aggressive and know that there’s plenty of good golfers behind me,” Simpson said. “I got to keep the hammer down.”

Stenson, who started on the back nine, offset his lone bogey of the round he missed a 15-foot par putt on the par-4 18th with three birdies during the four-hole span between Nos. 4-7.

“The game plan is there,” he said. “I got the set-up in the bag to give me those numbers off the tee that we need and it’s just about going out there and playing, continue making birdies and giving myself birdie chances. It’s a low scoring golf course … keep it going.”

Among bubble players, No. 125 Geoff Ogilvy played his way to the weekend late in his round. He had birdies on five of his final six holes to move to 4 under for the tournament good enough to help him beat the cut line of 3 under.

And No. 141 Johnson Wagner had the shot of the tournament so far, with an albatross on the par-5 fifth, using a 5-iron to hole out his 215-yard second shot from the right fairway. It was the first double-eagle at the tournament since Fabian Gomez had one on No. 15 in 2011.

I had a bunch of family that’s up by the green and they started going bananas,” Wagner said. “Pretty clear it had gone in.” Wagner shot a 64 to move to 9 under.

Some others weren’t so fortunate: No. 126 Daniel Summerhays was at even par while No. 126 Cameron Tringale was 1 under.

"Barcelona van attack: We saw people going flying because of the collision, says eyewitness","Injured people are treated in Barcelona after a white van jumped the sidewalk in the historic Las Ramblas district, crashing into a summer crowd of residents and tourists and injuring several people, police said. (Source: AP) Injured people are treated in Barcelona after a white van jumped the sidewalk in the historic Las Ramblas district, crashing into a summer crowd of residents and tourists and injuring several people, police said. (Source: AP)

A van ploughed into crowds in the heart of Barcelona on Thursday killing at least 13 people in what police said they were treating as a terrorist attack.

Police said they said were searching for the driver of the van who, according to local media, fled the scene on foot. Spanish newspaper El Periodico said two armed men were holed up in a bar in Barcelona’s city centre, and reported gunfire in the area, though it did not cite the source of the information.

It was not immediately clear whether the incidents were connected. A source familiar with the initial US government assessment said the incident appeared to be terrorism, and a White House spokeswoman said President Donald Trump was being kept abreast of the situation.

Media reports said the van had zigzagged at speed down the famous Las Ramblas avenue, a magnet for tourists.

“I heard screams and a bit of a crash and then I just saw the crowd parting and this van going full pelt down the middle of the Ramblas and I immediately knew that it was a terrorist attack or something like that,” eyewitness Tom Gueller told the BBC.

“It wasn’t slowing down at all. It was just going straight through the middle of the crowds in the middle of the Ramblas.”

Mobile phone footage posted on Twitter showed several bodies strewn along the Ramblas, some motionless. Paramedics and bystanders bent over them, treating them and trying to comfort those still conscious.

Around them, the boulevard was deserted, covered in rubbish and abandoned objects including hats, flip-flops, bags and a pram.

“We saw a white van collide with people. We saw people going flying because of the collision, we also saw three cyclists go flying,” Ellen Vercamm, on holiday in Barcelona, told El Pais newspaper.

TOURIST DRAW

Emergency services said people should not go to the area around Barcelona’s Placa Catalunya, one of the city’s main squares at the top of the Ramblas, and requested the closure of nearby train and metro stations.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he was in contact with authorities, and the priority was to attend to the injured.

The incident took place at the height of the tourist season in Barcelona, which is one of Europe’s top travel destinations with at least 11 million visitors a year.

Vehicles have been used to ram into crowds in a series of militant attacks across Europe since July 2016, killing well over 100 people in Nice, Berlin, London and Stockholm.

Witness Ethan Spibey told Britain’s Sky News: “All of sudden it was real chaos. People just started running screaming, there were loud bangs. People just started running into shops, there was a kind of mini-stampede where we were, down one of the alleyways.”

He said he had taken refuge with dozens of other people in a nearby church.

“They’ve locked the doors because I’m not sure whether the person who may have done it has actually been caught, so they’ve locked the doors and told people just to wait in here.”

Authorities in Vic, a small town outside Barcelona, said a van had been found there in connection with the attack. Spanish media had earlier reported that a second van had been hired as a getaway vehicle.

Barcelona is the capital of the wealthy northeastern region of Catalonia, which plans to hold a popular vote on Oct. 1 on whether it should secede from Spain. It is in dispute with the central government, which says the vote cannot go ahead because it is unconstitutional.

This is the deadliest attack in Spain since March 2004, when Islamist militants placed bombs on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people and wounding more than 1,800.

Khot announces committee to draft format of new party,"ENDING SPECULATIONS about his future course of action, Minister of State for Agriculture Sadashiv (Sadabhau) Khot announced on Saturday the formation of a committee to draw up the form and format of his new organisation. Speaking to The Indian Express, the minister said the name of the committee members will be announced in seven days.

Khot’s expulsion from the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana earlier this month had raised speculations about his political future. Considered a trusted lieutenant of Sanghatana founder MP Raju Shetti, Khot was sacked from the farmers’ union due supposed “anti-party activities”. Khot has also, reportedly, fallen out of favour with many leaders of the Sanghatana due to his alleged “proximity with the ruling BJP and his role in trying to scuttle the farmers’ strike”. There were also speculations that Khot may join the BJP and contest against Shetti in the 2019 elections from Hathkanagale, Kolhapur. “I will decide on my future course of action,” Khote said adding his organisation will “never expel or distrust its members”.

Bangladesh: Ten sentenced to death for attempting to assassinate PM Sheikh Hasina,"PM Sheikh Hasina narrowly escaped the attack that killed 23 people and injured hundreds. PM Sheikh Hasina narrowly escaped the attack that killed 23 people and injured hundreds.

Ten militants on Sunday were sentenced to death and nine others jailed for 20 years each by a court in Bangladesh for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2000. The convicts had hatched the plot to kill Hasina in 2000 by planting a high-powered explosive device at an open ground at her village home in southwestern Gopalganj where she was scheduled to address a public rally. Security officials, however, detected the bomb ahead of the rally.

On further investigation, outlawed Harkatul Jihad-e-Islami Bangladesh (HuJI) chief Mufti Hannan, who was executed earlier this year in another case involving attempted assassination of the then Bangladeshi-origin British High Commissioner, was found to be the mastermind of the plot.

Twenty-five suspects had been accused in the Special Powers Act case. Nine received 20 years in prison and were fined 20,000 taka each, while four were acquitted. “They (convicts) will be executed either by hanging or by shooting with permission of the High Court,” Dhaka’s Speedy Trial Tribunal-2 judge Mamtaz Begum said. Only eight of the accused faced the trial in person while the rest were sentenced in absentia.

Under the Bangladesh law, the death sentences would require to be endorsed by the High Court following an automatic death reference hearing. The convicts are allowed to file an appeal as well. The judgment came a Dhaka court nearly ended trial of another major assassination attempt on Hasina while she was the opposition leader as the chief of the Awami League in 2004.

An influential group of the then ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of ex-premier Khaleda Zia is believed to have masterminded the plot engaging HuJI to execute it. Hasina narrowly escaped the attack that killed 23 people and injured hundreds.

BNP leader and Zia’s son Tarique Rahman is being tried in the case in absentia as a prime accused. “The verdict of the case is expected by the year end,” a court official familiar with the development said.

Tottenham Hotspur are close to completing their first signing of the transfer window after agreeing a deal for Ajax Amsterdam centre back Davinson Sanchez, according to multiple British media reports.

Tottenham were likely to pay a club record fee of 42 million pounds ($54.2 million) for the 21-year-old, who scored six goals in 32 league appearances for Ajax last season and received the club’s player of the year award, the reports said.

The potential signing will reassure fans who have expressed concern over Tottenham’s inactivity in the current window. Spurs, who finished runners-up to Chelsea in the league last season, are the only team in the English top-flight that are yet to make a signing and have lost England international right-back Kyle Walker to rivals Manchester City.

Tottenham beat Newcastle United 2-0 in their opening league fixture last Sunday and will host champions Chelsea at Wembley on Saturday.

Landslide kills 40 in northeast Democratic Republic of Congo,"village of Tora on the banks of Lake Albert was left with 40 dead. (File) village of Tora on the banks of Lake Albert was left with 40 dead. (File)

A landslide has swept over a fishing village on the banks of a lake in the northeast Democratic Republic of Congo, killing 40 people, a regional official said today. Part of a mountain engulfed “a fisherman’s camp after heavy rains caused a landslide” the deputy governor of Ituri province, Pacifique Keta, told AFP.

He said 40 people were killed in the disaster in the village of Tora on the banks of Lake Albert on Wednesday. It follows devastating floods in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown on Monday that killed some 300 people.

“Yesterday, we buried 28 bodies and today we will bury 12 more,” said Keta.

A doctor at the nearby Tshomia hospital, Herve Isamba, said they were treating four people injured in the landslide. The vast country has experienced a number of previous such disasters. In May 2010, a mudslide that swept over the eastern village of Kibiriga killed 19 people: the bodies of 27 others were never recovered.

In February 2002, about 50 people were found dead after a wave of mud and rocks hit the eastern town of Uvira, submerging about 150 homes. Fishing on Lake Albert is one of the main occupations in Ituri, which borders Uganda. The province, rich in gold deposits, saw several outbreaks of violence during the Second Congo War between 1998 and 2003. That ended with the aid of a French-led international military intervention.

Terrorism & graft-free India in 5 years PM Modi’s target: Jitendra Singh,"Jitendra Singh talks to the media in New Delhi (File/PTI Photo) Jitendra Singh talks to the media in New Delhi (File/PTI Photo)

Union minister Jitendra Singh on Sunday said terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir was in its last phase as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had set a target to wipe it out from the country in the next five years. He said that just as the period between 1942, when the Quit India movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi, and 1947, when India got freedom, witnessed important developments, the five years of the Modi government would free India from terrorism, corruption and poverty.

“The prime minister has set a target to make India free from terrorism, corruption, casteism, imperialism and poverty… Despite getting freedom (in 1947), we are not fully free from these evils,” the minister of state in PMO told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Jammu. “Terrorism in Kashmir is in its last phase and within the next five years, Modi’s fight against corruption will be taken to the next level,” he said.

Singh said today’s India belonged to the youth and the task of “cleaning the mess” would be completed by them. On the issue of Article 35A, which allows the J&K government to define the “permanent residents” of the state, who are entitled to certain benefits, he said, “People who are out of power are trying to make it an issue.” “They want to create something out of nothing. They want make it complicated,” he said.

"Malaysia surprises with 5.8 per cent GDP growth, may add fuel to early election talk","A view of Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) in Malaysia August 15, 2017. REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin A view of Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) in Malaysia August 15, 2017. REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin

Malaysia’s economy expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in the second quarter on the back of domestic demand and robust exports, defying expectations for a slight slowdown. The strong performance is likely to add to speculation over whether Prime Minister Najib Razak will call an early election to take advantage of an economic recovery and a fractured opposition.

Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy grew 5.8 percent in April-June from the same period a year earlier, data showed on Friday, well above a Reuters poll forecast of 5.4 percent. Growth accelerated at 5.6 percent in the first three months of the year, which had also been better than expected.

Following the data, Malaysia’s central bank raised its 2017 growth forecast to above 4.8 percent. The last forecast in March predicted growth of 4.3 to 4.8 percent. “Based on the numbers from Q1 and Q2, we expect (full year) growth will go beyond our earlier forecast,” Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Governor Muhammad Ibrahim told a news conference. He expected domestic consumption and exports to improve further in the second half, but warned there were always risks related to external factors.

Exports grew 10 percent on-year in June, short of forecasts and well below the 32.5 percent pace in May. But analysts believe the weakness may have been due to seasonal factors, noting that global demand, particularly for electronics, still appears to be strong.

Fitch Ratings affirmed Malaysia’s ‘A-‘ credit rating with a stable outlook on Thursday, citing its strong economic growth and the government’s ability to contain the impact of falling oil prices on its budget deficit. “It is another recognition for the country’s economic management,” Najib tweeted earlier in the day about the Fitch ratings.

Other upbeat data on Friday showed the current account surplus grew to 9.6 billion ringgit ($2.24 billion) over the second quarter from 5.3 billion ringgit in January-March, due to a larger goods surplus and smaller services and primary income deficits.

Investment in Malaysian stocks, bonds and other financial assets also showed a sharp improvement in the quarter, with net portfolio inflows rebounding to 16 billion ringgit, compared with outflows of 31.9 billion in the first quarter. The turnaround may be partly due to improved confidence in the ringgit currency. It has strengthened 4.5 percent against the dollar this year since hitting a 19-year low of 4.9880 on Jan. 4.

However, foreign direct investment dropped to 8.3 billion ringgit in the quarter, compared with 17 billion ringgit in the first quarter. While FDI flows can be volatile from quarter to quarter, the weaker reading could point to some loss of economic momentum in the months ahead.

Election speculation

The central bank also said inflation is expected to ease further after moderating to 4 percent in the second quarter. “Inflation will still be within the range of 3-4 pct, but we expect it to track lower for the rest of the year compared to earlier quarters,” BNM’s Muhammad said. However, there is widespread public concern about the rising costs of living, which Najib will need to temper heading into the polls.

He may already be facing his toughest election ever as he looks to counter bad press from a corruption scandal involving state-owned fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and a growing challenge from his former mentor turned foe, Mahathir Mohamad.

On Wednesday, Najib brandished more than $3 billion in housing packages for the country’s majority ethnic group. Last month, he gave cash handouts and offered debt waivers to palm oil farmers, a key voter base. The increasing handouts have fuelled speculation he will call an election earlier than the scheduled deadline of mid-2018 to take advantage of the economic recovery and a fractured opposition.

Najib lost the popular vote in the 2013 polls, and is expected to roll out a voter-friendly budget this October targeted at the rural Malay electorate. ($1 = 4.2950 ringgit)

More than 40 installations are to light up London in one of the biggest ever light shows, Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Thursday.

Streets, buildings and public spaces will be illuminated during the Lumiere London festival which is expected to attract millions of visitors to the British capital next January.

The event takes place between January 18 and 21 in what Khan says will be a chance for people across the world to see London in a new light.

More than 40 British and international artists will transform London and offer new perspectives on the capital’s iconic architecture, streets and landmarks.

Building on the phenomenal success of Lumiere London 2016, festival destinations will include King’s Cross, London’s West End, including Carnaby, Regent Street, Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, Mayfair, Piccadilly, St James’s, Fitzrovia and Westminster.

Works will be exhibited on both sides of the River Thames, with Covent Garden, Victoria, South Bank and Waterloo added as new destinations for 2018.

Mayor Khan said: “Lumiere London 2018 will be bigger, brighter and bolder than ever before, with even more areas of the city involved and even more people expected to visit this incredible festival.

“Lumiere London 2018 shows that London is open to people from across the world and open to creativity and ideas, and open for business. There’s no better way to banish the January blues — so get ready to take to the streets and marvel at a dazzling array of incredible artwork and installations.”

Lumiere London in 2016 attracted more than 1.3 million visitors to London at a time when the city is usually quiet following the Christmas break.

"Sledging, shot clocks, coloured clothing… cue sports get their own IPL","India’s leading cueist Pankaj Advani will take part in Cue Slam, a city-based league that begins in Ahmedabad. India’s leading cueist Pankaj Advani will take part in Cue Slam, a city-based league that begins in Ahmedabad.

Mic’d-up players, soft-sledging and shot clock. In the backyard of one of the game’s most-celebrated purist, Geet Sethi, cue sports will flirt with some of the boldest changes in its attempt to go the IPL way. Cue Slam, a city-based league that begins in Ahmedabad tonight [Saturday], doesn’t exactly promise to revolutionise the sport. Instead, the idea is to lift it out of anonymity. And it’s poised to do it in a brash and glitzy manner.

Players’ wardrobes will now have bright-coloured polo shirts instead of the waist coats and bow ties. They will be encouraged to have a go at each other while the crowd, which is required to stay silent for the players to focus, wouldn’t be stopped from cheering even when a player is hunched on the table. Matches will last just 15 minutes and a player will have just 20 seconds to pot the ball. “It’s something the connoisseurs of the game might not approve of,” admits 16-time billiards world champion Pankaj Advani, who will lead the Chennai Strikers squad. “But to make it appealing to a wider audience, it is important to shake things up. I am excited to wear a yellow t-shirt instead of the bow tie. It’ll brighten things up and look good on TV.”

Television needs, in fact, dictate the format. One of the reasons Atul Pande, who’s company Sportzlive has conceptualised the league, chose Ahmedabad as the venue for the league’s first edition because ‘it’s Geet Sethi’s city’. But that’s where the tournament’s tryst with tradition ends. Pande, who was the CEO of a sports channel before starting this venture, says 90 percent of the revenue generated by these leagues comes from television. Its demands, then, cannot be ignored. “The viewer engagement does not last beyond one-and-a-half to two hours,” Pande says. “In that time frame, we have to finish a competitive match and also need enough moments to keep bringing people back again.”

The general perception of cue sports is that it is too formal. The well-mannered, crisply dressed cueists, silent stands and three-hour long matches made cue sports spectator unfriendly even though it is one of the most popular leisure activities. According to a survey by the league’s promoters, roughly 2.5 million people play the sport recreationally and it is also the ‘most downloaded game on mobile phones.’

Globally, too, India has done reasonably well. For years, the country’s cueists have won major international titles with Advani leading the current lot. Yet, the sport remains absent from the collective consciousness. “The conventional style is pretty long-form and does not render itself easy to television. A routine billiards or snooker game could last for three to three-and-a-half hours,” Pande says. “We are trying to crunch the matches into 20 minutes. The TV and digital product needs to look appealing enough.”

To create drama – the staple for TRP-driven TV shows – players will be made to wear collar mikes. They are expected to indulge in some banter and also engage the audience by voicing their thoughts while cueing up for a shot – a twist inspired by the IPL, where players are wired up while on field. “Our intention is to create a story, rivalry of sorts. Because rivalries are watched. We still don’t know how it’ll play out on live TV,” Pande says.

Cue Slam, of course, isn’t the first league to experiment with its format. It’s promoters tried something similar with badminton, which fetched them mixed results. The Pro Badminton League had three games of 11 points each instead of the standard 15. The rivalries were created by having trump matches, where the best player of each team player his counterpart. The format attracted mixed reviews, with the 11-point system drawing flak from the players. However, there are no such apprehensions among the players with regards to Cue Slam.

“It won’t be a club game. There will be an element of seriousness to it but at the same time, there is an attempt to make it look casual,” Advani says. Though the money isn’t as big as most other IPL-inspired leagues, it’s still decent enough. Advani, for instance, will earn approximately Rs 15 lakh for a week’s job. Most of the ‘icon players’ earn in that bracket. The league owners, though, do not expect to make any profit. “We are investing a million dollars (roughly Rs 6.5 crore). But we will lose half-a-million. This is our first year, we are sampling and testing it out,” Pande says.

The jury is out on whether the format clicks. But it’s already dividing opinions. Yasin Merchant, India’s first professional snooker player, says if the format deviates too much from the traditional format, ‘then the purpose of popularizing the sport does not arise.’ “If you want to look at it in terms of gimmickry, it’s good for the game,” the 50-year-old says. “(But) People would rather prefer to watch a Geet Sethi making a 500 break in its pure form than something like this.”

Pakistan’s Malala “excited” after winning place at Oxford University,"Yousafzai, now 20, came to prominence when a Taliban gunman shot her in the head in 2012, after she was targeted for her campaign against efforts by the Taliban to deny women education.

Yousafzai, now 20, came to prominence when a Taliban gunman shot her in the head in 2012, after she was targeted for her campaign against efforts by the Taliban to deny women education. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.

Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize when she was 17, said on Thursday she was “excited” after winning a place to study at Oxford University.

Yousafzai said she had been accepted at Oxford to study Politics, Philosophy, and Economics. She joined thousands of other students in Britain in discovering where they will go to university after getting their final school results.

Others to have studied the same course at Oxford, one of the world’s top universities, include former British Prime Minister David Cameron and late Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

Yousafzai, now 20, came to prominence when a Taliban gunman shot her in the head in 2012, after she was targeted for her campaign against efforts by the Taliban to deny women education. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.

“So excited to go to Oxford!! Well done to all A-level students – the hardest year. Best wishes for life ahead!” she said in a tweet. A-levels are final year exams for school students.

After recovering from the Taliban attack, she has attended school in England.

Early figures showed a fall in the number of places allocated by universities, although the proportion of students scoring top grades rose.

University admissions service UCAS said on its website the decrease in the number of university acceptances had been driven by a fall in acceptances from older students and fewer students from the European Union.

UCAS said 416,310 people had been accepted to degree courses on A-level results day, down two percent compared to 2016. But over 1 in 4 of the grades was an A or A*, the best ratings, up 0.5 percentage points on last year.

"40% reservation for girls at planned Navodaya schools, says Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi","The Minister of State for Minority Affairs said the government is mulling to open the 100 Navodaya-type schools in minority concentrated areas.

The government has decided to proffer 40 percent reservation for girls at 100 Navodaya-type schools and five higher education institutes it plans to setup for minority community students, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has said. The Minister of State for Minority Affairs said the government is mulling to open the 100 Navodaya-type schools in minority concentrated areas of the country. “We want to empower the communities with dignity and, therefore, are focusing on the education sector. We will give 40 per cent reservation to girls from the communities in the schools and also in the institutes. This is to ensure they complete their education,” he told PTI.

A high-level panel formed by the Maulana Azad Education Foundation (MAEF), a government-funded agency, had in its report recently recommended a three-tier model to tackle educational backwardness among minorities, particularly the Muslims. The suggested model includes creating infrastructure to impart education at primary, secondary and tertiary levels by opening 211 schools, 25 community colleges and the five institutes.

The panel had said the proposed schools could work on the patterns of Kendriya Vidayala or Navodaya Vidyalaya. Under the Navodaya Vidyalaya system, rural students are selected and provided with quality education, which is among the best in the country. They are also provided with food and lodging facilities. Naqvi said the schools will “most probably” be commissioned next year in buildings developed under the multi-sectoral development programme (MsDP). MsDP is a programme for developing infrastructure and creating assets in areas dominated by minority community with an aim to take tangible and intangible benefits to them.

The minister said that the governments in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have expressed interest in setting up the institutes for higher education. There are six notified minority communities in the country: Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis and Jains

Qatar expressed concern about the safety of its citizens in Saudi Arabia following the reopening of the countries’ border enabling Qataris to attend the annual haj pilgrimage in Mecca. Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said during a visit to Norway that Saudi authorities had yet to respond to queries from the Qatari Ministry of Islamic Affairs regarding the security of Qatari citizens during haj.

“The level of tension between the two nations, the language and the tone of the Saudi media spreading hatred against Qatari people represents a great concern for us,” he told a news conference.

“Those people crossing the border right now are under the responsibility of the Saudi authorities for their security and safety,” he said, adding that “more than 100” citizens had crossed since the border was reopened.

Diego Simeone says Atletico Madrid can use transfer ban as motivation,"Atletico’s head coach Diego Simeone. (Source: AP) Atletico’s head coach Diego Simeone. (Source: AP)

Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone said on Friday his players will dig deep in the face of adversity as they begin the new season shackled by a transfer ban and with key players missing.

Atletico will be without striker Kevin Gameiro and left back Filipe Luis for the opening game at newly promoted Girona. Thomas Partey and Diego Godin are suspended, deepening the deficiencies of a squad banned from registering new players.

The ban, imposed by FIFA for the illegal transfer of minors and upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in June, means Atletico cannot count on the services of their one new signing, Vitolo, who is spending the first five months on loan at Las Palmas before joining up with Simeone’s side in January.

The squad has been further weakened by midfielder Tiago retiring and Theo Hernandez leaving for Real Madrid, while the club has parted ways with Matias Kranevitter and Rafael Sante Borre.

Crucially, however, Antoine Griezmann, Saul Niguez and Koke have all been persuaded to stay, signing new long-term contracts, while Fernando Torres agreed a one year extension.

“The club has made a huge effort to keep its most important players and it’s clear that the players who have stayed have a huge sense of belonging here and that reflects well on the club,” Simeone told a news conference on Friday.

“Now we have to reflect that on the pitch. Some would see not being able to sign players as a weakness but we’ve taken it as a positive because we all know each other, we know how we want to play, and that boosts the essence and ideas of the team.”

Forward Luciano Vietto is reported to be on his way out to Italian side Sampdoria but has been named in the squad for the trip to Girona.

The Catalan side are gearing up for a first season in the top flight in their 87-year history and have signed experienced Liga players such as goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz from Athletic Bilbao and former Espanyol forward Christian Stuani from Middlesbrough in their bid for survival.

Girona have also brought in four players on loan from Manchester City, whose parent company, City Football Group, is reported to be close to purchasing a majority stake in the club.

Author Akhil Sharma talks about short stories and compelling characters,"The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo) The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo)

The greatest challenge for a short story writer, says one of the foremost names in the field — who might not be too well known in India but has built up an impressive resume in the US — is to stick to its ideal length, with the writer captivating his readers in a way that they have no desire for more.

“Knowing that a story is only 15 or 20 pages means that you are restricted in how many characters you can have or situations you can entertain. This means that the entry into the story has to be so strong that the reader has no desire for more,” Akhil Sharma told IANS in an email interview from New York.

The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. He maintained that once a writer goes beyond this length, the stories begin to take the shape of novellas. But temptation is always lurking around the corner.

“The problem is that characters can be so compelling that one feels the need to follow them,” he quipped.

Delhi-born Sharma, who emigrated to the United States in 1979, is certainly not among the most well-known faces of our literary fraternity but the illustrious career of this prolific author is still a distant dream for many writers.

His stories have been published in the New Yorker and Atlantic Monthly, and included in “The Best American Short Stories” and “O. Henry Prize Collections”. Sharma’s first book, “An Obedient Father”, won the PEN/Hemingway Award in 2001. His second novel, “Family Life” won the Folio Prize in 2015 and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2016. “I began writing ‘We Didn’t Like Him’ the day after I handed in my novel ‘Family Life’. I began it with the idea that I just wanted a story with a beginning, middle and end. I had the opening line and I had an idea for someone who wants to be a televangelist.

“I then just began describing the character and trying to make him sympathetic. Part of this meant inventing his back story and what would be natural for him as his life progressed. I wrote one ending and it didn’t satisfy me and so I wrote another,” the author said on being asked to throw light on the journey of a short story — from the time of its inception to its fulfilment.

“We Didn’t Like Him”, along with seven others, comprise his latest book. Titled “A Life of Adventure and Delight” (Penguin/Rs 599/190 Pages), the book is a collection of stories that focus on Indians at home and abroad and plunge the reader into what Sharma calls the unpredictable workings of the human heart.

Sharma said that he loves short stories. “They are demanding and fun and there is the sense that unlike a novel, one is not held hostage by them,” he elaborated. The author further shared that his short stories have become looser with time. “They cover longer periods. I find that the transition between my paragraphs is not as tight. More and more I think short stories are simply narratives where an event occurs and a character changes or does not change even though we would expect him to,” he contended.

Sharma hoped that short stories are published in newspapers like they used to be in the past, adding that they have a specific place in the world and will always remain relevant.

"Seven years since teen’s death after egg donation, mother moves MSHRC","Pramila Pandey with her daughter’s photo. Express Pramila Pandey with her daughter’s photo. Express

Seven years after she lost her daughter allegedly to complications stemming from ovum donation, the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (MSHRC) has taken cognisance of a complaint filed by Pramila Pandey. Fixing the first hearing date in November, the commission has asked the deputy commissioner of police, Zone X, to be present before it. The commission will question the reasons behind the delay in “delivering justice” to Sushma Pandey, who died at the age of 17 years after illegally donating her eggs at an IVF clinic.

In a complaint to the MSHRC, Pandey has claimed that she approached Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) in 2013 with a complaint against Bandra-based Rotunda – The Center for Human Reproduction Fertility Clinic, where Sushma had donated her ova thrice between 2009 and 2010. While the MMC has held at least four hearings in the matter, a decision to whether it amounts to a case of medical negligence on the part of Rotunda’s medical director, Gautam Allahbadia and his staff members, remains pending.

The MMC, currently under the interim charge of its administrator Dr Abhay Chaudhary, is yet to get a fresh board of members to handle the backlog of cases.

On August 10, 2010, two days after donating ovum at Rotunda clinic, Sushma passed away at Rajawadi hospital after complaining of abdominal pain.

Pandey claims she was unaware that her minor daughter was an egg donor and she had posed as Sushma Dube with a fake PAN card that showed her age as 19 years. In her complaint to the MSHRC, she has alleged that the clinic did not follow all safety measures and took no step to verify whether Sushma was eligible for ovum donation.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines state that an egg donor must be above 18 (later revised to 21 years) and less than 35 years of age. The Assisted Reproductive Technologies (Regulations) Bill and Rules (2009), state that a fertility clinic is supposed to verify the age before registering a donor.

In 2014, the Bombay High Court had pulled up the Mumbai Police for their investigations into the case. In 2015, the Sakinaka Police filed a supplementary chargesheet naming Dr Allahbadia, along with Dr Kaushal Kadam, Dr Gauri Gupta, who conducted the surgery, anaesthetist Dr Hetal Chabria, Dr Kirit Trivedi, and Dr Yogen Bhatt, as accused. An agent, Noorjahan, and Sushma’s former employer have also been named. The case is underway at the Andheri sessions court, although no hearing has taken place.

Sushma had donated her ovum on October 22, 2009, February 15, 2010, and August 8, 2010 before she succumbed to medical complications. According to a report submitted by J J hospital, a rise in hormones led to shock causing her death.

“My daughter got no money in return. She was lured into this without my knowledge. I have been visiting the MMC office and the police station regularly. The case has remained stuck for years now,” Pandey, who resides in Saki Naka, said.

In her one-room flat, a picture of Sushma is placed next to a television set. Sushma’s father, a driver, has lost hope that those responsible would be held accountable. “The director (Allahbadia) has left the country. Other doctors continue to work. What about other minors lured into egg donation for money?” Pandey asked.

According to a human rights commission official, while the MSHRC cannot hold hearings against a private clinic, it can take a decision against government officials, including the MMC officials, for delaying the case. The last hearing in Sushma’s case in the MMC was held in 2015.

"Nineties, Unplugged!","Alisha Chinai rose to fame with her song “Made In India”, which is still remembered by fans everywhere. Alisha Chinai rose to fame with her song “Made In India”, which is still remembered by fans everywhere.

In november 2015, of the 60,000 people who had gathered at London’s Wembley Stadium to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a rally-cum-reception, many didn’t recognise the singer dressed in an ivory lehenga, who came on stage just ahead of the PM’s address. But they soon did. As composer Biddu’s popular synth prelude began playing and the artiste began to croon, the crowd erupted in loud cheer and chants of “Ek dil chahiye that’s made in India”. It was then that Alisha Chinai, pop icon of the Nineties, knew that she was far from forgotten. “That song has been my identity for a really long time.

All I need to do is sing ‘Made in India’ and people follow,” says the singer, with a laugh over a telephone conversation from her south Mumbai apartment. Chinai, among the earliest of Indipop stars in the country, burst on to the scene in 1995, on the back of her successful playback stint in Bollywood — Kate nahi kat te for Shekhar Kapur’s Mr India — with a music video that featured supermodel Milind Soman. Made in India married western beats to Indian sounds, creating a fusion that was both different and catchy. Chinai would be dubbed the Indian Madonna and go on to spawn a generation of pop artistes who aspired to make music differently. “People still listened to international stars such as Michael Jackson, Backstreet Boys and Aqua, but now, there were a bunch of musicians singing of our experiences in Hindi and that appealed to people,” says musician Leslie Lewis, 58, who had composed many pop songs of the time.

The Nineties were an interesting time to be a musician in India. After liberalisation, the scope of private and foreign investments scaled up, paving the way for the entry of foreign broadcasters such as MTV and Channel V in the country. These gave people a taste of contemporary music from across the world, from a range of artists such as Madonna, Whigfield and bands like Shakespears Sister and Michael Learns to Rock. There was an explosion of choices and a talented bunch of artistes grasped it with both hands. Suneeta Rao, known for her song Pari Hoon Main (1991), says, “We all knocked on the doors of music producers, but we wanted to do more than just playback music. Bollywood didn’t have space for people who thought clearly and boldly and wanted to do something different. That industry only wanted a certain kind of voice, a particular pitch. It was either for a heroine or a vamp, nothing in between,” says Mumbai-based Rao, who now does live shows and writes music.

The Nineties were also a time to experiment. There was Shweta Shetty dressed in a man’s suit, singing about Johnny Joker, her red lipstick as unmistakable as her deep, husky voice, in a Ken Ghosh video. Daler Mehendi gave bhangra a twist and got his audience to go Tara rara with him. While Jasbir Jassi, a young wedding singer from a pind in Punjab, sang of being thrilled about his heart being stolen by a girl from Gujarat (Dil le gayi kudi), Bally Sagoo was adding slick beats to Malkit Singh’s Aaja nach le and Gud naal ishq mittha, a song that still brings back memories of the Malaika Arora and Jas Arora video. If Colonial Cousins, comprising Hariharan and Lewis, were introducing pop to us with a touch of the classical, Shubha Mudgal’s Ab ke saawan was taking classical music to the masses. Falguni Pathak found success with Yaad piya ki aane lagi, a folk-based pop album, and, would go on to become a staple at dandiyas, while Anamika Grover turned an RD Burman ditty, Kahin karta hoga, into bubblegum pop. If Mehnaz aspired to be a beauty queen in Banoongi main Miss India, the Aryans sang of teenage love with songs such as Aankhon mein tera hi chehra.

The foundation of this success, however, was laid a decade ago — when the Pakistani brother-sister duo Nazia and Zoheb Hassan became the toast of South Asia with Disco Deewane (1981). “Disco Deewane sold 100,000 records within a day of its release in Mumbai. Without any internet, without the kind of marketing systems that exist today, it was a paradigm shift for the music industry. People were interested in music that was hip and their own pop by virtue of being in their own language,” says Zoheb in a conversation from London, where he settled down after the death of his sister in 2000.

This new sound was also markedly different from what Bollywood was producing at the time. Apart from AR Rahman (Roja, Dil Se) and a few soundtracks from Jatin-Lalit (Lamhe, Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge), Bollywood, says British-Indian music producer Bally Sagoo, “was producing really mediocre stuff and that’s why there was such a spurt in interesting non-film music”. Sagoo, who began making music in Birmingham after being inspired by hip hop and reggae, was among the earliest to cash in on the trend. Merging Western beats with Punjabi folk, he came up with upbeat numbers that have become staple at clubs and wedding parties. “For the first time, people realised that you could have a music video and it didn’t have to be attached to a film. That awareness, and consequently, the investments in music videos and the presentation of the artistes that followed changed how one perceived singers. They became performers,” says Sagoo, 53, who is remembered for a reworked version of Asha Bhosle’s Chura liya hai (1996),the Punjabi pop hit Aaja nach le (1998) and for his remix of Lata Mangeshkar’s Noorie for Gurinder Chaddha’s Bend It Like Beckham (2002). His compositions and remixes were also in Mira Nair’s Monsoon Wedding (2001) and Mistress of Spices (2005). Now, primarily, a music producer for the UK and US markets, Sagoo was presented the inaugural trophy for outstanding achievement by Spice Girls at UK Asian Awards, 2003.

By the mid-2000s, however, Indipop’s glory days were fading and the focus was shifting once again to Bollywood. “It was hard to keep up with Bollywood. They had the infrastructure and the resources. Once they caught on to the formula, everything and everyone eventually got absorbed by it. Those who couldn’t keep up, left and looked for alternate careers,” says 47-year-old Jasbir Jassi. Sonu Nigam, who had delivered a brilliant album like Deewana (2003) and Shaan, a Tanha Dil (2000), went on to have successful careers as playback singers. “It was necessary to adapt to Bollywood’s ways because either you toed the line or they would hire someone else to replace you,” says Jassi.

Bollywood’s ascendancy would also spell bad news for music companies such as Magnasound and Polygram that had been launch pads for so many pop artistes. The record labels had begun investing more than they could chew. “I heard that for Daler Mehendi, who was paid Rs 2 lakh for his first successful album (Bolo Ta Ra Ra, 1995) that sold almost 75 lakh copies, the amount was increased to Rs 2 crore for the next one. It ended up with approximately 50 lakh copies sold. The profits weren’t as big and the companies began to lose money,” says Jai Walia of the Aryans.

The arrival of the internet would sound an emphatic death knell for Indipop. Most music companies couldn’t keep up and went out of business. “Music labels tried to create paid content for a while for musicians who wanted to find a footing in Bollywood. Many of these artistes were musicians who had had their moment, but for music channels and record labels to survive, they needed more than that,” says yesteryear pop star Anaida of Nazuk Nazuk fame. It was only a matter of time before MTV’s content would be dominated by reality shows such as Roadies and Splitsvilla. While Channel V veered away from music, MTV India had a brief moment of rejuvenation with Coke Studio India, MTV Unplugged and MTV Indies, but it was too little too late.

The internet may have hit the industry hard, but, over time, it has also helped some artistes turn their fortunes around. Chinai after having delivered monster hits such as Kajrare from the 2007 film Bunty Aur Babli and a forgettable outing with Krishh 2 (2013), is now trying to harness the power of the social media to release a couple of songs on YouTube. “I know I’ve had my head buried in the sand, but, as an artiste, I am clear that one can’t die with the song inside. I don’t believe in numbers. I want to do quality work and perform once in a while. That way, one doesn’t get burnt out. That’s probably part of the reason that every time I come back, there is a certain amount of freshness. I’m known to be a hitmaker,” says Chinai, who says her fight for royalties in Bollywood has left her far from satisfied.

Shweta Shetty, another Magnasound artiste, worked as a playback artiste for a while before marriage took her to Germany in 1997. Shetty has spent the last decade learning the ropes of opera while travelling with English classical soprano and actor, Sarah Brightman (known for her productions Cats and Phantom of the Opera). When the two met, Brightman was married to musical theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber and had collaborated with Shetty in the album Harem (2004), a combination of operatic vocals and Middle-eastern sounds. Shetty returned to India last year and unsurprisingly, played a man’s role — Shylock — in a version of The Merchant of Venice, called Reth — Songs of the Sand, directed by Satyabrata Rout. “I want to cater to an audience that does not know of my existence. This young audience is well travelled, intelligent, has access to various genres of music. I think they are ready for the opera,” says Shetty, 48.

Anaida, the half-Indian and half-Iranian singer who came under the spotlight at 15 with her teen album, Hotline, has turned chef and entertainment consultant. “I got out of pop music when the scene got a little crazy and when Bollywood and the internet began edging Indipop out. I had the first mover’s advantage and I wanted to harness my interest and expertise in food to profitable ends,” says the 37-year-old, who is the chef/partner at SodaBottleOpenerwala in Mumbai’s Powai and focuses on authentic Persian cuisine. “The digitisation of music has actually helped people like me. Some days, I write and compose five trance/dance tracks. My Swedish producers put it online the same day and likeminded people just follow it. You don’t even have to advertise,” says Anaida, who has recently completed an album on Rumi, that is being mixed in LA by Grammy-nominated producer Luigie Gonzales. Like her, Walia, too, is preparing to launch his cafe in Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh, where he will have a live music space for struggling musicians. He has also moved completely away from pop, choosing instead to cut an album of ghazals that will be released soon online.

Anamika Grover, who shot to fame with her remixes, is planning to follow in Chinai’s footsteps and release a Punjabi album titled Chak De Dhol online. “You don’t need a record company anymore as long as you create your own music and put yourself out there,” she says. The internet’s already given her a fan following in the north Indian wedding market and the NRI crowd — Grover spends a few months every year overseas, performing at NRI weddings and at Navratri celebrations, where her chartbusters Kala sha kala and Kahin karta hoga still remain the most requested numbers. Does she miss the kind of popularity she once commandeered? “I can’t say I am disillusioned. My fans are spread across the globe. I am making good money. It’s only how I work that has changed,” she says.

Tune into the popular soundscape online and among the handful of Indian “pop” videos floating around on YouTube, very few make the cut. Neha Bhasin’s work, in particular, her modern takes on Punjabi folk songs of Surinder and Prakash Kaur, however, touch a chord. “I have grown up watching Indipop. That was why I participated in a reality music competition to form the first girl band in India (Viva). Now, more than anything else, I want to be a pop icon for my personal satisfaction. They say internet killed the pop stars, now I am trying to use it to set myself up as one. It’s time to get the swagger back,” says Bhasin.

Chinese fans tell ‘homesick boy’ Carlos Tevez to stay away,"Carlos Tevez flew to Buenos Aires this week for treatment on a muscle injury. (Source: File) Carlos Tevez flew to Buenos Aires this week for treatment on a muscle injury. (Source: File)

Chinese football fans and media are urging underperforming Carlos Tevez not to return from a trip to Argentina, nicknaming him “Very Homesick Boy” as speculation swirls that he wants out of China.

The 33-year-old Argentine former international has been a flop since moving this year to Shanghai Shenhua on a fat salary, scoring only twice, missing half the games through injury and having his commitment repeatedly questioned by fans.

Tevez, who has previously suggested he would look to leave after the season, flew to Buenos Aires this week for treatment on a muscle injury.

The trip has fuelled suspicions that he may not return, though the Chinese Super League (CSL) club told AFP this week Tevez was expected back by the end of the month.

Shanghai Shenhua made Tevez one of the best-paid players in the world when they signed him in January from Boca Juniors on reported weekly wages of around 730,000 euros ($850,000).

But the former Manchester United, Manchester City and Juventus star has failed to settle and has been christened by supporters and media in China as “Very Homesick Boy” — a play on how his name is pronounced in Chinese.

The label is also an apparent reference to Tevez’s falling-out with then-City boss Roberto Mancini, when Tevez refused to warm up as a substitute in the last moments of a Champions League match against Bayern Munich in September 2011.

Tevez flew back to Argentina and considered retiring, before eventually returning to England in February 2012.

Many football fans on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, criticised Tevez.

“He won’t need to come back in person. I’ll deliver his luggage to logistics companies,” said one posting. “Tevez shamelessly went back to Argentina. Don’t ever come back,” said another.

“Shenhua’s highest-paid yet worst foreign player. As a Shenhua fan since 1994, the club’s management this season is the worst ever,” added another.

Shenhua say that a break in the CSL season made it a good opportunity for Tevez to seek rehabilitation back in Argentina and that the decision to let him go was made after discussions between the player and the club’s medical team.

Gianluigi Buffon saves VAR penalty as Juventus beat Cagliari,"Gianluigi Buffon saved a penalty. (Source: Reuters) Gianluigi Buffon saved a penalty. (Source: Reuters)

The opening match in Serie A also produced the first decision from video review on Saturday. The Video Assistant Referee awarded a penalty to Cagliari but Diego Farias’ effort was saved by Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and the Bianconeri went on to win 3-0.

“I don’t want to comment on the VAR, just as before I didn’t comment on the referees’ decisions,” Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said. “I’ll only say that luckily we have Buffon in goal: He’s still the best.”

Juventus has had a difficult few months: Losing its second Champions League final in three years and key defender Leonardo Bonucci moving to AC Milan amid reports of infighting. It also lost the Italian Super Cup to Lazio last weekend.

“Considering that at the beginning of the season there’s a bit of sparkle lacking, we did well,” Allegri said. “When the team works together in defense it’s difficult for our opponents to shoot on goal. In preseason we always conceded, and that was a sign that something wasn’t working.”

It took the Bianconeri less than 12 minutes to open the scoring when Mario Mandzukic volleyed in Stephan Lichtsteiner’s cross. This is the first season that Serie A has introduced video technology, and it got its first use at the end of the first half.

Duje Cop went down under Alex Sandro’s challenge and, after a bit of hesitation, referee Fabio Maresca summoned video reviews. After consulting with the VAR and looking at the incident on a pitchside monitor, he gave a penalty to Cagliari.

Buffon saved Farias’ penalty and Juventus doubled its lead in first-half stoppage time when Dybala controlled Miralem Pjanic’s ball over the top and fired it home. Dybala also hit the bar two minutes into the second half.

Gonzalo Higuain extended Juve’s lead shortly after the hour with a precise strike into the bottom far corner after being set up by Alex Sandro. New Juventus signings Blaise Matuidi and Douglas Costa made their Serie A debuts after joining from Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich respectively.

Vigilance Bureau raids properties of irrigation officials,"A DAY after a criminal case was registered against several serving and retired officers of the Punjab irrigation department, Vigilance Bureau (VB) teams on Saturday searched two properties at Phase 9 in Mohali and Sector 19 in Chandigarh where the accused officers used to prepare the documents for private contractor Gurinder Singh, the prime accused in the multi-crore scam.

“The VB teams seized various papers, indicating that both these properties were used to prepare the documents to complete the tendering process for Gurinder’s company,” a VB source told Chandigarh Newsline. The VB also contacted various banks to seize the accounts of all the accused booked in the case. The investigating agency is also preparing to check the documents of all the properties, worth around Rs 100 crore and owned by Gurinder.

According to sources, Gurinder owned residential plots numbering 3309, 4072, 4073 and 5059 at Aero City in Mohali. Besides, VB also identified that Gurinder owned industrial plots E-13 in Industrial Area, Phase 7; E-318 in Industrial Area Phase 8; a hotel site in Sector 66, plots B-39 in Sector 57A, C-3 in Sector 57 A. Besides Mohali, VB identified Gurinder’s properties, including plot No. 103 at Bulakhpur village in Ludhiana district, plots K-95 and H-280 in Yamuna Authority, Noida, and a shop at Omaxe Mall in Patiala.

Sources said investigation revealed that the accused also had a stake in a micro-brewery in Chandigarh. “We are now investigating the properties the irrigation officers have bought. We have also sought details of some projects executed by the irrigation department in the Kandi area to which Gurinder Singh was a party,” said sources. They also revealed that VB sleuths visited several banks on Saturday where Gurinder had accounts to make a request to seize them.

The VB on Friday booked two serving and four retired officers of the irrigation department along with Gurinder.

"AIADMK merger: Talks on reunion moved a step forward, says O Panneerselvam","Panneerselvam, a former chief minister, had revolted against the leadership of jailed party chief V K Sasikala in February last, causing a split in the party. Panneerselvam, a former chief minister, had revolted against the leadership of jailed party chief V K Sasikala in February last, causing a split in the party.

Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and rebel AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam on Sunday said talks regarding the the merger of the warring factions led by him and current CM K Palaniswami have moved a step forward and expressed that a “good” decision would be reached shortly. “I had informed that the merger talks are already progressing smoothly. It has progressed one more step…A good decision will be attained shortly as desired by you,” he told mediapersons after a meeting with his party functionaries.

Panneerselvam stated that the party will be united, insisting that no party interference will be allowed to persist in the party, ANI reported. On Saturday, Panneerselvam had indicated a positive result was expected in a “day or two”. Meanwhile, Palaniswami had also stated he was confident that “both the factions would merge soon”.

AIADMK Amma faction veteran and Education Minister K A Sengottaiyan had echoed him. “It will be good decision and it will happen to the liking of the cadres and people,” he said while referring to the ‘positive views’ expressed by both Panneerselvam and Palaniswami.

As per sources on both sides, the merger might fructify on Monday. The factions led by OPS and Palaniswami seemed to have chalked out the formula for re-unification following the end of many marathon meetings over the past few months.

The AIADMK merger talks started gaining momentum after Palaniswami on August 17 announced that an inquiry commission would be set up to probe the death of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa and that her Poes Garden residence would be converted into a memorial, two of the key demands put forth by Panneerselvam camp. However, the OPS camp’s key demand of removal of jailed party chief VK Sasikala from the party remain unmet.

Panneerselvam had launched a rebellion against the leadership of Sasikala in February last, causing a split in the party.

India’s economy became fastest growing under PM Modi’s rule: Amit Shah,"Bhopal: BJP National President Amit Shah addresses during the launch of ‘Mukhyamantri Medhavi Vidhyarthi Yojana’ at Lal Parade ground in Bhopal on Sunday.

PTI Photo (PTI8_20_2017_000125B)

BJP president Amit Shah on Saturday said that India’s economy has become the fastest growing in the world after Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014. “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country’s economy has become the fastest growing economy in the world,” said Shah while addressing a function in Bhopal. Shah also blamed the previous UPA rule for putting the economy in a bad shape. During its rule the economy was in a state of paralysis and the development was stranded, said Shah.

Speaking at a function to distribute certificates to meritorious students, Shah said that recognising the potential of the youth of the country, the government has launched schemes like Start-Up India, Stand-Up India and Skill India to provide forum to them. He said it was the responsibility of the youth to ensure development of the country as they comprise 65 per cent of the total young population. “Therefore, it is the duty of the government to provide a forum to the youth-power and their immense potential so that they can stand up to ensure the country’s development at the world level,” he said. The Modi-led government at the Centre has focused on skill development and started the ‘Skill India’ scheme, he said.

Besides, to give wings to the youth potential, the government also launched Start-Up India and Stand-Up India schemes so that they get associated with the country’s development process, the BJP chief said. By taking advantage of these schemes, the youth of the country would be in a position to offer jobs rather than seeking it, he said. Shah said he sees immense potential in Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s meritorious students’ scheme and that it will give boost to the state’s development.

“Shivraj’s government has framed schemes for the welfare of all sections of the society and ensured that its benefits reach to the bottom level. Because of this only, Madhya Pradesh had come out of the BIMARU (laggard) state category and is standing among the developed states,” he said.

On the occasion, Chouhan said his government wants to create industrialists like Tata, Birla and Ambanis in the state and that is why his government is providing guarantee to the banks for providing loans to youth. The prime minister wants to make India a “vishwa guru” (world leader), he said, adding that his government is also making all possible efforts for it.

In his new book, Neel Mukherjee keeps an unwavering focus on the inequities, inequalities and exploitation of human beings by human beings

Title: A State of Freedom

Author: Neel Mukherjee

Publisher: Penguin Random House

Pages: 278

Price: Rs 599

If Neel Mukherjee’s Booker-shortlisted The Lives of Others (2014) was a diachronic dissection of the Ghosh family, spanning lifetimes, in his latest offering, A State of Freedom, he uses his linguistic scalpel for a synchronic cutting open of India’s now and here. Less a novel than a set of five linked narratives, their lengths ranging from a brief eight pages to a novella-length 100, A State of Freedom is probably the most sustained reflection on class in post-Liberalisation India in contemporary fiction. Reminiscent of two monumental works of non-fiction, P Sainath’s path-breaking Everybody Loves a Good Drought, published over two decades ago, and Sudeep Chakravarti’s Red Sun: Travels in Naxalite Country, published in 2008, Mukherjee’s novel brings back to the discussion table issues that seem to have fallen out of favour with the chatterati and the intelligentsia these last few years.

From the opening narrative’s unnamed protagonist, the Kolkata-born and–bred “tourist in his own country”, whose two decades in “the academic communities of the East Coast of the USA [have] defanged him of the easy Indian ability to bark at people considered as servants”, to the second narrative’s first-person narrator, a London-based designer, also Kolkata-born, who too is appalled at the way in which supposedly educated people like his own parents treat domestic workers in India, to the “servants” themselves, who are the subjects of the three remaining narratives, Mukherjee keeps an unwavering focus on the inequities, inequalities and exploitation of human being by human being in every story.

Yet, as the protagonists of his stories seem to believe, and Mukherjee himself seems to at times, not all human beings are equal, or, more problematically, capable of being equal. In the second narrative, the first-person narrator parenthetically describes his own use of the term “domestic help” thus: “(My mother’s generation still called them servants. My politically correct tag [i.e. domestic help] had not a jot of correlation to their status: their position in the Indian social hierarchy or economy had never changed)”. But this ironic self-deprecatory statement is marred by the statement, a few lines earlier, of the creation of the state of Jharkhand “carved out… after decades of agitation and activism by tribal peoples and backward castes — they had that dreaded Indian distinction, the branding iron of an acronym: OBC, Other Backward Castes — for a separate state…” etc. One notes several things here. First, the bleeding-heart-liberal championing of the underdog (tribals and backward castes); second, the use of the adjective “Indian” (see all the quotes above — Indian ability, Indian social hierarchy, dreaded Indian distinction); and, finally, the egregious error about the expanded form of “OBC”, which stands for “Other Backward Classes” and not “Other Backward Castes”. Is this the narrator’s error or Mukherjee’s? And is the repeated use of the adjective “Indian” to indicate primitive, casteist, sexist, class-biased positions a reflection of the narrators’ views or Mukherjee’s own? Not an easy question to answer.

A central takeaway from this beautifully written novel is that if one is born in middle-class, relatively privileged, urban India (a member of the English-medium class) one can only imbibe democratic and human values, and develop the ability to look critically at oneself, if one lives in the West; remaining in India dooms one to continue one’s horrifically solipsistic middle-class existence, treating everyone who is one’s social inferior with contempt and brutality. Such, for example, are the people who are Milly’s employers — the domestic help/servant who moves from the underdeveloped Naxal-infested jungles of Jharkhand to the highrises of Bombay/Mumbai (where she works for the parents of the second story’s narrator, among others) — one of whom, in Kolkata, is described as having picked up and thrown a 10-year-old boy “down the hole through which the lift goes up and down”. Milly, central figure in the novella-length narrative, is told she “should be grateful for what you have — things are far worse out there” by the tribal Christian woman who had got her a job as a domestic worker.

Mukherjee’s novel strikes all the right guilt-ridden-anti-capitalist-liberal-pinko-lefty chords so beloved of the West’s educated classes: middle-class Indians (who are actually pretty near the top of the class hierarchy, and so, should be seen as rich) are brutal exploiters of innocent tribals; innocent tribals who convert to Christianity end up exploiting their own people; development has only added modern forms of misery and enslavement to India’s traditional heritage of discrimination and violence; the only way out of this seems to be death, whether willed or otherwise. No wonder it has won high praise from Western critics. But for this reviewer, the biases that Mukherjee seeks to lay bare with his cutting prose end up revealing some of his own — and these are not always very pretty.

A magnificently written, marvellously phrased book, with its heart in its right place, A State of Freedom might not be quite what its Western critics claim (“devastating portrait of the inhumanity of the rich to the poor”, and so on) but it is certainly worth the read, if only to discover what it stumbles in attempting as also what it succeeds in achieving.

A Man of His Times,"This book is primarily a compendium of Kanvinde’s most important works over these five decades. This book is primarily a compendium of Kanvinde’s most important works over these five decades.

ACHYUT KANVINDE AKAR

Edited by Tanuja & Sanjay Kanvinde

Niyogi books

464 pages

` 7,000

By Riyaz Tayyibji

Achyut Kanvinde, born in the small village of Achara in Maharashtra, belonged to the first generation of modern Indian architects who returned to practice in India after an education abroad, in their quest to find an appropriate contemporary expression for a young country with a long past.

Contrary to popular belief, modern architectural design did not find its way to the subcontinent on the back of Le Corbusier. A group of young Indian architects including Habib Rehman, Piloo Modi and Achyut Kanvinde had already established a base here with their work. Kanvinde, deeply influenced by the great Walter Gropius, had a strong rationalist orientation and an exposure to engineering and construction, which would profoundly influence the course of Indian architecture in the five decades after independence.

This book is primarily a compendium of Kanvinde’s most important works over these five decades. The work itself is presented chronologically and their decade-wise grouping subtly brings out the fundamental shifts in Kanvinde’s work over his incredibly prolific career. Along with the architectural work, which is represented through generously sized drawings (including a marvellous appendix of construction drawings) and photographs, this book also contains the great architects’ own words and writings.

One glimpses a wide array of subjects, from his own work to architectural education, the role of the building professional, and, most engagingly, anecdotes of his experiences with the many great people he worked with. From statesmen like Jawaharlal Nehru, the industrious Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and Dr. Homi Bhabha to the master architects: Gropius, Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. These personal experiences are not only of historical value, but make for enthralling reading for anyone interested in history, architecture or simply the spirit and energy of the time just after 1947. Kanvinde’s own writings are simple, and deal directly with the problems and solutions pertaining to our built environment. The tone of his writing, as much as their content, gives us insight into the man known for his quiet humility, unequalled generosity and professional commitment.

In order to tell us more about the man, the editors have interspersed a series of essays into the book, written by Kanvinde’s colleagues, historians and family members, thus creating a background to the work that ranges from the historical to the intimate. However, though an important aspect of the book, this is also, perhaps, its weakest link. The essays are informative, but lack a certain tautness of narrative.

Much more importantly, the book re-produces the work done by Kanvinde at the JJ School of Architecture during his student days. Comprising both sketches and project work, these drawings talk about the predilection and general direction of the country’s architectural education at the time. The book looks at that historic moment of May 17, 1959, when, at the ‘Seminar on Architecture’ at Lalit Kala Academy, Kanvinde delivered an address titled ‘Architectural Expression and National Policy’. Kanvinde argued for a functional, technology-driven modern architecture embedded in the society of the day. The historical implications of this event are not lost on the editors of this book as they reproduce Nehru’s address along with Kanvinde’s own intimate anecdotes about proceedings.

Modern buildings are rarely ‘pretty’. Made in bare materials and unadorned by softer finishes, they’re robust and driven by functional needs. Yet, in the hands of a great architect, like Kanvinde, these buildings have a fierce and powerful beauty. There is a tactile exploration of material, their organisation into evocative structural configurations that allow for a play of light, of inside and outside, of sun and shadow, of movement and gathering. This is an architecture of doing a lot with very little: for a country that had very little. One simply has to turn to page 148 and look at Kanvinde’s Dudhusagar dairy project for the National Dairy Development Board at Mehsana, to recognise that an industrial building can be given a poetry of form. Balanced horizontals and verticals, the play of raw concrete and white plaster, the power of architectural composition squeezed out from a most pragmatic of requirements.

This book brings out the unparalleled relentlessness with which Kanvinde followed his modernist convictions. An almost spiritual orientation which helped the architect find a deep resonance with the historic architecture of the subcontinent. Though modern in its appearance, his buildings seem to imbibe an age-old understanding of the environment in which he built.

Throughout his career Kanvinde’s work was in partnership, first with Shaukat Rai, and then with the addition of Murad Chaudhary. This book documents his final decade of practice, which was largely a

personal one. Now, he challenges his rationalist approach with projects that have high symbolic content (temples) and require logic other than function. He responds to these self-set challenges by returning to his roots — to his JJ School training and to the poetry of Tukaram. Kanvinde’s life work is a study of systematic architectural development in search of dissolution and belonging. An architect who takes the impulses and influences from a foreign place and brings them home. This book is a fitting tribute to the journey of India’s greatest professional, modern architect.

"Usain Bolt blew £7,000 post retirement at a bar","Usain Bolt ran his last competitive race at the World Athletics Championship. Usain Bolt ran his last competitive race at the World Athletics Championship.

Usain Bolt and his friends spent a staggering £7,030 in a bar bill following the Jamaican’s disappointing end to his glittering career. One of the most decorated sprinters of all time and his pals drank five bottles of Dom Pérignon Champagne – two of them £940 magnums. He also ordered a bottle of vodka at £570, three bottles of £500 cognac, 23 Red Bulls costing £5.50 each and 18 cans of coke at £2.50 each.

If that wasn’t enough, Bolt showed he’s an extremely generous tipper to splurge £500 cash on top of the 15 per cent service charge which was added to the £6530.23 bill.

Bolt and friends partied at the DSTRKT nightclub in London alongside partner Kasi Bennett and Love Island stars. The partying and clubbing went on for three nights. One partygoer was reported to have said: “He was buying everyone drinks. It descended into a crazy party.”

Bolt also posted a Snapchat video at 5 AM while pouring champagne in his ear and saying: “Don’t judge me. This is what I do. I don’t give a s***.”

Bolt didn’t get the best end to his career as he finished with a bronze medal in the 100m sprint at the Athletics World Championship. However he limped off in the 4 X 100m relay final as the anchor runner. However, Bolt – a Manchester United fan – wants another sporting career and hopes to impress the legends of the game when he plays in a charity match for United on September 2. But for that, he has to get fit.

Indians are now ready to go global: Designer Manish Arora,"Manish Arora said he wanted to showcase here what he shows internationally because the Indian market is now becoming open to things happening globally. Manish Arora said he wanted to showcase here what he shows internationally because the Indian market is now becoming open to things happening globally.

Manish Arora has been winning hearts on the international runway and the designer said in the past few years, the Indian fashion scene has evolved immensely as people are now more aware about the global trends. Arora, who has established himself as a brand internationally, presented his collection at the Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017.

It was the first time he showcased his latest Paris collection on the Indian runway. “Ten years ago when I started showing in Paris there were hardly any people from India travelling there. Right now you go anywhere you see Indian people, not NRIs but people from India. They are now travelling a lot, they are seeing things and gaining experiences.

“Around 60 per cent of our population is in the ’30s and they all have this craving to learn and be a part of the global phenomenon, and fashion is one of them. Indians are now ready to go global,” Arora said. “That is the reason why I came back with the Manish Arora Paris brand. I had never shown it here before. I wanted to showcase here what I show internationally because the Indian market is now becoming open to things happening globally.”

The designer showcased his collection for the first time in Paris Fashion Week in 2007 and has been a regular since then. “It’s been quite an adventurous journey. I have learned a lot in the past ten years. I have celebrated a lot. But I would say I have just begun.” The designer said he might be working keeping the international sensibilities in mind, but in the past one decade he has always made sure to maintain the Indian ethos of the brand alive.

“The craftsmanship in my clothes is very Indian but workmanship is very international. It is easy to understand. It is not like I am just making Mughal flowers. Even though I might use zardozi, but I will make stars or planets out of it. “My work is all about embellishments and techniques. It has tribal elements but it is very new. We use all luxurious fabrics.”

The Paris collection, which he showcased here last night, was titled “Cosmic Love”. The creations were a visual interplay of colours, styles, intricate silhouettes and designs. From Tribal Africa, Aztec prints to art deco touches, Arora created geometric patterns with patchwork and embroidery. Velvet appliques and optical illusion peacock embellishments in gleaming gold and green dominated the range.

Astrology played a major role for embroidery, as shooting stars and golden sun rays appeared on silk crepe drawstring dresses and cropped denim jackets. Swarovski crystals were used for paisleys that were embossed on burgundy tunic dresses and velvet gowns. The colour palette included shade of mustard, tangerine, midnight blue, violet, fuchsia and royal blue.

From denim tunics, tiered evening wear, satin quilted bombers, the look progressed to flowing wrap dresses, silk trouser suits, silver, silk and organza dresses, waistcoats, sweatshirts and skirts. Arora said he is now getting ready for his next show in Paris Fashion Week on September 28. The designer is also planning to expand his brand. “I am the only brand, who has managed to be Indian, and be outside the country. I think till now it is me and I am happy about that. But at the same time it is all about having a strong identity and how much you can work hard. I trying to explore avenues outside fashion,” he said.

Donald Trump to visit Marine base in Yuma before Phoenix rally,"US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

The White House says President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit a Marine Corps base in Arizona along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump is set to visit Marine Air Station Yuma on Tuesday afternoon before he travels to Phoenix to hold a rally.

Yuma’s location along the US-Mexico border touches on one of Trump’s signature issues: his call for putting up a border wall to stem illegal immigration from Mexico.

The rally in Phoenix will take place at the city’s convention center. Trump tweeted about the event last week with a link for ticket availability.

The president has been holding campaign-style events in Trump-friendly areas since he took office. The rally will be his first in the West.

Gary West, the coach who guided Anna Meares to gold at the 2012 London Olympics, has died at the age of 57, Cycling Australia said on Sunday.

West stood down as Australia’s head track sprint coach last year after eight years in the role when he was diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease (MND).

“Gary was a man of utmost integrity,” Cycling Australia CEO Nick Green said in a statement. “His accolades both on and off the bike as a cyclist and coach are well documented: he was a leader, he was humble and a visionary in all aspects of life and sport.

“Beyond the track, he was a loving husband and father, and friend to so many involved in our sport.” West competed in the points race at the 1984 Olympics and won gold in the 4,000m team pursuit at the 1982 Commonwealth games but it was as a coach that he enjoyed his greatest success.

He took over as coach of Meares after she won a sprint silver at the 2008 Olympics and four years later in London was at her side when she gained revenge over British rival Victoria Pendleton to take the gold.

Delhi Daredevils look to rope in Jason Gillespie as head coach,"Jason Gillespie played 71 Tests and 97 ODIs in a career spanning a decade for Australia. (Source: AP) Jason Gillespie played 71 Tests and 97 ODIs in a career spanning a decade for Australia. (Source: AP)

Former Australian pacer Jason Gillespie is in talks to become Delhi Daredevils head coach for the next season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The 42-year-old ended his association with Yorkshire in 2016 and is currently part of Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash League.

The Daredevils are presently without a coach in their ranks with Rahul Dravid having opted to continue as coach of the India under-19 team. This after the BCCI’s new rules regarding conflict of interest had left coaches and support staff personnel in the country to pick between working for IPL and national teams.

The Indian Express has learnt that Gillespie himself has shown interest in being part of an IPL team a few months ago. Gillespie has been part of the IPL in the past, after having been roped in as the bowling coach for Kings XI Punjab in 2011. Sources at the Delhi franchise, meanwhile, confirmed that talks are indeed on, but nothing has been finalised yet.

“He brings a lot to the table. He has vast experience behind him. He has shown keenness to be a part of Delhi team and talks are still on,” a Delhi Daredevils official said.

Impressive CV

Gillespie played 71 Tests and 97 ODIs in a career spanning a decade for the Australians during their indomitable reign as the foremost cricket team in the world, forming a deadly new-ball pairing with Glenn McGrath. He then made a very successful switch to coaching, especially at Yorkshire, where he lifted the struggling county from the second division in his first season before helping them win back-to-back County Championship titles in 2014 and 2015.

He was also attributed with playing a significant role in the development of Yorkshire cricketers who then went on to become England mainstays like Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow and David Willey. There were even talks of him taking over the England job following the sacking of Peter Moores last year but it didn’t work out. Since ending his time with Yorkshire and returning to his hometown of Adelaide last year, he’s continued to be in high demand as coach.

In addition to being touted to become Australia’s bowling coach at some point, Gillespie’s already worked this year in an interim capacity with both Kent — as bowling coach — and the Papua New Guinea national team — as head coach. He was also named as bowling coach of the Australia A team to tour South Africa, which unfortunately got scrapped owing to the pay dispute crisis Down Under.

Recently, during an interaction with the media in Bengaluru at the National Cricket Academy Gillespie insisted that he is still committed to the Adelaide Strikers. “I do a little bit of work for Cricket Australia. I’ll be looking to see what other opportunities are out there in T20 leagues around the world,” Gillespie said. The pacer was in the city with other five Australian coaches to conduct a re-certification programme for Level 3 Indian coaches. In other Delhi Daredevils related news, India’s former pace spearhead, Zaheer Khan, has confirmed that he’s keen on playing in next year’s IPL.

Bankruptcy law to boost investor confidence in corporate bond market: Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi,"SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi (PTI Photo) SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi (PTI Photo)

Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman Ajay Tyagi on Saturday said that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) will help boost investor confidence and encourage fund inflows into the corporate bonds market, especially in low-rated instruments.The bankruptcy law was enacted to ensure time-bound settlement of insolvency and enable ease of doing business.

“From an investors’ standpoint, an effective and robust bankruptcy regime is important for developing the corporate bonds market. Investors have been shying away from low-rated corporate bonds and even if the rating is of investment grade, given the high rate of defaults,” said Tyagi who was speaking at the insolvency and bankruptcy summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here. “Successful implementation of the IBC will increase confidence among investors, including foreign ones, and is likely to increase liquidity in low-rated papers,” said Tyagi.

He said globally bankruptcy reforms has had significant impact on developing corporate bonds market in various parts of the world.“In Brazil the corporate bond market as percentage of GDP increased from 12 per cent to 26.3 per cent, in Russia from 8.1 per cent to 13.1 per cent; it also increased significantly in China and Britain. In our country fund raising from bond was 17.9 per cent of GDP in 2016 and it would be interesting to see the impact of implementation of this code on the corporate bonds market,” said Tyagi.

The Sebi chairman also said the regulator has taken steps to strengthen the rating mechanism followed by credit rating agencies to enhance an early-warning system to identify potential defaulters.“As per the mechanism rating agencies will carry out a review of rating on occurrence of an announcement of material events such as transactions, corporate debt restructuring, and a significant increase in debt levels and then will come out with a press release about the rating action,” said Tyagi. Tyagi said the August 4 Sebi circular has tightened the disclosure norms for listed companies on default of bank loans and other financial intuitions.

Scandal-marred USA Gymnastics needs sweeping change: Aly Raisman,"Raisman, who was around Nassar regularly at the team’s training facility in Texas and at meets around the globe, declined to talk about whether she was treated improperly. (Source: Reuters) Raisman, who was around Nassar regularly at the team’s training facility in Texas and at meets around the globe, declined to talk about whether she was treated improperly. (Source: Reuters)

Aly Raisman is ready to talk about “the elephant in the room.” And the six-time Olympic medal-winning gymnast thinks it’s time USA Gymnastics joins in a conversation she feels is long overdue.

The 23-year-old is calling for sweeping change in the organization in the wake of dozens of allegations of sexual abuse by former national team doctor Larry Nassar, a scandal that has left one of the U.S. Olympic movement’s marquee programs scrambling and Raisman shaken.

Nassar spent nearly 30 years as an osteopath with the USA Gymnastics program and is now in prison in Michigan after pleading guilty to possession of child pornography. He is awaiting trial on separate criminal sexual conduct charges, in addition to being sued by more than 125 women who claim he sexually assaulted them under the guise of treatment.

Nassar has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, and the dozens of civil suits filed in Michigan are currently in mediation .

Raisman, who was around Nassar regularly at the team’s training facility in Texas and at meets around the globe, declined to talk about whether she was treated improperly by Nassar. She did agree to speak more generally, calling Nassar “a monster” and blaming USA Gymnastics for failing to stop him and spending too much of the fallout attempting to “sweep it under the rug.”

“I feel like there’s a lot of articles about it, but nobody has said, `This is horrible, this is what we’re doing to change,”’ Raisman said in a wide-ranging interview Saturday shortly after she and other members of the “Final Five” that won team gold at the 2016 Olympics were inducted into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

Raisman served as a captain for both the “Final Five” and the “Fierce Five” that won gold in London in 2012. While several alleged Nassar victims have come forward, including 2000 Olympic bronze medalist Jamie Dantzscher, Raisman is the highest profile athlete yet to publicly reprimand the organization. Raisman said she kept quiet waiting after the initial allegations surfaced last summer, waiting for USA Gymnastics to own up to its mistakes.

While it is taking steps toward creating a safer environment for its athletes, she doesn’t believe it is doing nearly enough openly enough, adding that she feels USA Gymnastics is trying to get on with business as usual.

“What people don’t realize is that this doctor was a doctor for 29 years,” Raisman. “Whether or not he did it to a gymnast, they still knew him. Even if he didn’t do it to you, it’s still the trauma and the anxiety of wondering what could have happened. I think that needs to be addressed. These girls, they should be comfortable going to USA Gymnastics and saying: `I need help, I want therapy. I need this.”’

USA Gymnastics launched an independent review of its policies in the wake of the allegations against Nassar and reporting by the Indianapolis Star that highlighted chronic mishandling of abuse allegations against coaches and staff at some of its more than 3,500 clubs across the country.

In June, the federation immediately adopted 70 recommendations proffered by Deborah Daniels, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the review. The new guidelines require member gyms to go to authorities immediately, with Daniels suggesting USA Gymnastics consider withholding membership from clubs that decline to do so. The organization also named Toby Stark, a child welfare advocate, as its director of SafeSport. Part of Stark’s mandate is educating members on rules, educational programs, reporting and adjudication services.

USA Gymnastics said in a statement late Saturday it welcomes Raisman’s passion, adding it’s “appalled” by the accusations against Nassar.

“We are taking this issue head-on, and we want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe,” USA Gymnastics said.

Daniels said repeatedly when her review was published that she wasn’t hired to make judgments on past missteps, something that doesn’t fly with Raisman. She pointed to the reported $1 million severance package given to former president Steve Penny after he resigned under pressure in March as proof that the organization just doesn’t get it.

“I thought, `Wow, why couldn’t they create a program?”’ Raisman said. “A million dollars is a lot of money. They could do a lot of things to create change. They could create a program. They could even contact all the families that have come forward and say. `Can we help your kid with therapy?”’

Lynn Raisman, Aly’s mother, said USA gymnastics needs to “get rid of the people who knew and looked the other way.”

Raisman has used her celebrity and extensive social media reach as a platform to promote positive body image and anti-bullying. She’s currently living in Needham, Massachusetts, working on an autobiography due out in November while weighing whether to take a shot at the 2020 Games. Either way, she wants USA Gymnastics to evolve and stressed there’s a difference between her criticism of USA Gymnastics and the sport as a whole.

The sport is fine. She loves gymnastics. It’s the parent organization that needs to undergo a transformation. And she’s clear on the message she wants it to send.

“Everyone is important,” Raisman said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re the Olympic champion or you’re an 8-year-old that goes to gymnastics in Ohio, or wherever you are in the U.S. Every single kid is important and I want USA Gymnastics to do a better job with that.”

Describing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a ‘sufi Prime Minister’ who always thinks of good governance, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said here on Saturday that only a sufi can think of the welfare of the downtrodden in this way.

Speaking at a function organised by Gujarat Minorities Finance and Development Corporation (GMFDC) Ltd, where he distributed cheques of Rs 6 crore to 535 loan seekers from minority communities, Naqvi, who holds charge of the minority affairs ministry, said “empowerment with dignity without appeasement” is the current environment of development all over the country and the Modi government is “trying to reach out to the last man in queue without any religious or caste discrimination”.

“We will not let any destructive agenda dominate society. Giving you this assistance is our duty and your right,” Naqvi said, concluding his speech by chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and “Vande Mataram”.

"In Charlottesville, Germans see echoes of their struggle with history","White nationalists carry torches on the grounds of the University of Virginia, on the eve of a planned Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, US August 11, 2017. Picture taken August 11, 2017.

Picture taken August 11, 2017. Alejandro Alvarez/News2Share via REUTERS

For the past decade, the pupils of the Manfred von Ardenne school in Berlin have been visiting a local cemetery to tend the graves of victims of the Nazis. By honouring those who died doing forced labour for Adolf Hitler’s regime and learning their stories, pupils gain a clearer, more visceral understanding of their country’s crimes 75 years ago.

“It is very important for us to bring our pupils closer to what happened to make sure it never happens again,” said Annemarie Sardisong, the school’s head teacher. “Especially now when the world seems to be coming out of joint.” In few countries was public opinion so shocked by last weekend’s events in Charlottesville, Virginia, as in Germany, where the sight of skinheads marching by torchlight and chanting anti-Jewish slogans had historical resonance.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned “racist, far-right violence”, although she also stressed that Germany had its own problems with extremism and needed to put its own house in order before pointing the finger at others. But when US President Donald Trump declined in a press conference to distance himself from white supremacists chanting “Jews will not replace us”, even the officially impartial German public media struggled to conceal its shock.

“There is a new reason to be worried about the condition of the US,” said news anchor Claus Kleber in a Tuesday evening broadcast. Eight years after the United States elected its first black president, “we thought America had overcome its original sin of slavery and racism. Is this a relapse?” After the fall of the Nazi regime, which murdered some 6 million Jews in concentration camps and gas chambers, atoning for crimes like the Holocaust was central to post-war West Germany’s ambitions to win back the world’s trust.

From the first, unamendable article of the German constitution, which declares “human dignity is inviolate”, to bans on extremist organisations and totalitarian symbols, or “political culture” classes in schools, huge efforts go into maintaining a healthy polity. Such sensitivity can take foreigners by surprise.

Last week, a drunken American tourist was assaulted in the eastern city of Dresden for giving an outstretched-arm Hitler salute and then charged with the crime of displaying the symbol of an unconstitutional organisation. Two Chinese tourists had a similar experience, detained and fined by a passing policeman for giving the “Hitler greeting” when posing for photographs in front of the German parliament.

In the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes, when a young woman was killed as far-right activists marched under the sign of the Nazis’ swastika symbol, Trump’s failure to draw a distinction between neo-Nazis and their opponents shocked. “For an American president, his reaction was completely inappropriate,” said Bengt Kasper, 54, a history teacher taking his class round the Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar.

SUPPRESSING HISTORY

All over Germany lie “Stolpersteine”, or stumbling stones embedded in pavements, marking the last place where victims of Nazis lived in freedom before being murdered by the regime. Remembrance culture ensures the past is never far away. Visitors familiar with London memorials that glorify generals who carried out bloody imperial campaigns in the 19th century or statues in the US to Confederate leaders who fought to preserve slavery in the American Civil War are often surprised by Germany’s emphasis on commemorating its darkest deeds.

“I have the feeling that in the US a lot of history is suppressed. We do it differently here – just look at where we are,” said Martine Pukownick, 48, a nurse visiting Buchenwald, standing next to the ovens in which prisoners dead of exhaustion or typhus were cremated.

It is an irony that much of the ground for today’s remembrance culture was laid by the U.S. and British victors who occupied Germany after World War Two, said Jeannette van Laak, a historian. “It was part of the democratisation programme put in place by the allies,” she said, describing exhibitions they put on to inform a defeated and demoralised population about the horrors Germany perpetrated. “It wasn’t just pedagogical finger-wagging,” she said. “It was sober and objective.”

Even in Germany, this ground is contested. A long line of conservatives, chief among them the late Franz-Josef Strauss, who ran the state of Bavaria for decades, have criticised what they see as Germany cringing before its past. Today, that line is represented by the hard-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), which is set to enter parliament for the first time in a Sept. 24 election. Bjoern Hoecke, one of its most prominent politicians, caused uproar by describing the vast field of stark concrete pillars that is Berlin’s Holocaust memorial as a “monument of shame”.

Controversy has been stirred in the United States by the removal of monuments to the pro-slavery Civil War Confederacy, a step decried by Trump in comments which echoed the views of white nationalists and drew stinging rebukes. “I saw how memorials were built and destroyed in East Germany,” said Kasper, the history teacher, who cautioned against tearing down statues. “It was the government that decided. That’s not the way to go. Americans must decide for themselves. It should not be decided rashly and emotionally.”

A lamp at the top of the Elizabeth Tower which houses the UK’s iconic Big Ben will be switched off for the first time in more than 70 years, authorities said today. Located above the Great Bell known as Big Ben, the Ayrton Light – which is switched on in the evening whenever Parliament is sitting – needs to be fully dismantled and restored. A temporary light will replace it, the House of Commons has said.

Installed in 1885, the historic lamp was previously turned off only during both world wars. Big Ben will not chime regularly until 2021 because of repairs to the tower, the BBC reported. The light is said to have been installed at the request of Queen Victoria, so that she could see from Buckingham Palace when members of either the Commons or the Lords were sitting after dark.

The lamp is named after Acton Smee Ayrton, a Liberal politician who was First Commissioner of Works between 1869 and 1873. It is not yet known when the light will switch off, or how long it will be off for.

Big Ben will go silent from midday on Monday. The House of Commons has said it will look again at the length of time it will be silenced after “concerns”. Parliament said it had to protect workers carrying out the renovations.

But Prime Minister Theresa May said “it can’t be right” that the bell will not chime regularly again for four years. It will still sound for important events including New Year’s Eve and Remembrance Sunday.

Indonesia angered after Malaysia shows its flag as Poland’s,"Indonesia’s national flag, printed upside down, is seen on the guidebook of the Opening Ceremony of the 29th South East Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017. (AP Photo/Yau) Indonesia’s national flag, printed upside down, is seen on the guidebook of the Opening Ceremony of the 29th South East Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017. (AP Photo/Yau)

Indonesia has accused the Malaysian organizers of the Southeast Asian Games of negligence after the Indonesian flag was printed upside down in a souvenir guidebook. The mistake, which makes the red-and-white Indonesian flag resemble Poland’s, has caused anger in Indonesia where “shameonyoumalaysia” has become the most popular hashtag on Twitter.

Indonesia’s Olympic Committee chairman Erick Thohir said the mistake “shows negligence” and demanded the guidebook be withdrawn and a new version printed. “Friendship is the greatest legacy in sports, but a mistake in presenting a national identity is not justified,” he said.

Indonesia appears to have taken particular offense because the guidebook was distributed to VIPs at Saturday’s opening ceremony in Kuala Lumpur for the 29th Southeast Asian Games and only its flag was shown incorrectly. Youth and Sports Minister Imam Nahrawi said the error was “very painful.”

President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo also called for an apology but cautioned against exaggerating the incident. “We are waiting for an apology from the Malaysian government because this is related to the pride of our nation,” Jokowi said Sunday.

The Malaysian Organizing Committee said its chairman and Malaysia’s sports minister would meet with Nahrawi to apologize. “We very much regret the mistake,” it said in a statement.

Malaysia and Indonesia are both Muslim majority nations and share a similar language but often trade accusations of stealing the other’s food and culture. The creation of Malaysia when the British empire was dismantled after World War II was bitterly opposed by Indonesia, itself then a new nation emerging from Dutch colonial rule and a short-lived Japanese occupation.

On Twitter, Indonesians said their flag represents the sacrifices of independence heroes and accused Malaysia of either being stupid or deliberately misprinting it. “You know, this is maybe the reason why our founding father Soekarno wanted to Kick Your Ass,” said one user.

Manchester United oozing confidence after handing out another mauling,"Following the opening day mauling of West Ham by the same score, United manager Jose Mourinho was a happy man. (Source: Reuters) Following the opening day mauling of West Ham by the same score, United manager Jose Mourinho was a happy man. (Source: Reuters)

Manchester United fans would be ill-advised to start dreaming about the Premier League title just yet but they will be heartened by another vintage performance in a 4-0 rout of Swansea on Saturday which showcased their attacking firepower.

Following the opening day mauling of West Ham by the same score, United manager Jose Mourinho was a happy man.

“I think the team is confident and in both matches winning 1-0 at halftime, we didn’t start the second half looking like we had to keep a clean sheet to win the match,” he said.

“We tried to control the game by keeping the ball and creating chances and we did that in both matches,” he added.

“The players that came on from the bench did well. Easy for me to make decisions, easy for me to make changes. The players make the manager look better and I thank their fantastic attitude because we know we have to have a squad to do something special this season.”

Midfield anchorman Nemanja Matic bossed the centre of the pitch, allowing a rejuvenated Paul Pogba to venture forward and score his second goal in two games while striker

Romelu Lukaku netted his third after selfless work throughout the match.

Henrik Mkhitaryan and substitute Anthony Martial, who again scored as a late substitute, also continued to thrive.

“We are more confident (than last season),” Pogba told Sky Sports.

“We know each other more. We work for each other and I think that is easier for us. We want to carry on on this road.”

Mkhitaryan spoke about United’s passion and team spirit, factors which have been lacking for long spells since the departure of manager Alex Ferguson in 2013 when United won their 20th and last league title.

Cracks in last season’s disappointing sixth-place finish were papered over by winning the League Cup and the Europa League, the latter allowing United to qualify for the Champions League group stage.

Mourinho signed Matic, Lukaku and Sweden defender Victor Lindelof, who is yet to make his Premier League debut as Phil Jones forced his way into the starting 11 with good pre-season form.

United now have the squad depth they have lacked in the past four years and although their credentials are yet to be tested against stronger rivals, former Wales striker John Hartson believes they will be a different prospect this season.

“Clearly the opposition will get tougher for Manchester United,” Hartson told the BBC.

“But in terms of the first two games they’ve been faultless. In that three or four minute spell where they took the game away from Swansea, they were devastating.”

China launches probe into Brazilian broiler chicken imports,"China also has anti-dumping duties on US broiler chicken products. (Representational photo) China also has anti-dumping duties on US broiler chicken products. (Representational photo)

China on Friday launched an anti-dumping investigation into imports of Brazilian broiler chicken and products after a complaint from the domestic industry that the South American country has been selling its chicken below market value. Brazil accounted for more than 50 pct of broiler product supplies to China between 2013 and 2016, a Commerce Ministry statement said on Friday, according to a preliminary review by the local industry and the ministry.

China, the world’s No. 2 poultry consumer, relies on imports for its supply of white feather broiler chickens, which are favoured by fast-food chains like KFC and McDonalds for their more rapid development and plumper meat, compared with yellow-feathered birds, which are native to China and generally sold retail.

The country also has anti-dumping duties on US broiler chicken products. Any move to penalise imports would be a further blow to Brazil’s meat industry following a scandal over its beef exports earlier in the year, which threatened to tarnish the country’s powerhouse protein industry. China is the biggest national consumer of Brazilian meat.

The move also comes just months after Beijing slapped hefty penalties on sugar imports from top growers such as Brazil and Thailand after lobbying by domestic mills.

My outfits will never overpower my personality: Taapsee Pannu,"Taapsee Pannu says looking like a diva is not her aim and she will never let clothes define her personality. Taapsee Pannu says looking like a diva is not her aim and she will never let clothes define her personality.

She may be experimenting a lot with her fashion choices, but actor Taapsee Pannu says looking like a diva is not her aim and she will never let clothes define her personality. The 30-year-old star, who has lately been sporting edgy and out-of-the-box looks, says she does not go by the fashion trends and only wears clothes that she can manage easily.

In an interview, Taapsee says, “The credit of dressing me up goes to my sister-in-law, Devki, who is also my stylist. She stays in the US and styles me from there. She is pharmacist by profession and does styling for fun. “I openly say that fashion is not my main aim. It is not

that I constantly follow what’s happening in the world in terms of fashion. But I believe if you know how to carry yourself and follow your own style, you become fashionable. Devki knows my style, she knows what suits me. (But) My outfits will never overpower my personality. They don’t define me, I define them.”

The actor says she loves dressing up for events and getting clicked, but the trend of the airport-gym looks have not gone down well with her. “People are after the airport look, gym look, etc. It bothers me a lot. If I am taking a 5 am flight, I can’t afford to look fashionable. I am not a hardcore fashion person. I have made peace with it. I have decided I will wear what I like and not care about what the fashion police has to say. Still, it does stress me out. But it is an occupational hazard. Nothing much can be done about it,” says Taapsee.

The “Naam Shabana” actor today walked the ramp at the Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 for designer Divya Reddy.

Taapsee slayed the runway in a floor-length embellished jacket worn over a delicately-embroidered sheer piece. The actor says walking the ramp has always been a nightmare for her, right from her modelling days. “I believe there are different expectations attached when you are a model and things are different when you are showstopper. When I used to model, I felt like a nameless body carrying clothes.

“So, now I really enjoy (it). I like the fact that a designer would create something for me or want me to represent their creation for the first time in front of the world. That makes me feel special. People will not look just at my clothes but also at my personality,” she adds.

Taapsee will next be seen in “Judwaa 2”. The movie, also featuring Varun Dhawan and Jacqueline Fernandez, will release on September 29.

PCB slams Umar Akmal for wrongful allegations against coach Mickey Arthur,"PCB believes that the whole issue has been put up by Akmal in order to divert from his fitness issue. (Source: File) PCB believes that the whole issue has been put up by Akmal in order to divert from his fitness issue. (Source: File)

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in their press release on Friday lashed out at Umar Akmal, after their recent bitter war-of-words with coach Mickey Arthur. PCB believes that the whole issue has been put up by Akmal in order to divert attention from his fitness issue. On Friday, PCB also issued a show-cause notice to Akmal. His recent claims on coach Arthur have been described as ‘bogus attempt’ to divert attention from his own failings.

The press release issued by the PCB said, “While making frivolous allegations against the national team management, Umar has made a bogus attempt to deviate attention from his own failings. He was given as many as seven chances to improve his fitness and match the standards of his teammates, laid out by the team management. He was given a program to improve his fitness like other players before the West Indies tour and after he failed the tests in Lahore, he was left out of the team.”

Earlier in May, Akmal was unable to clear his fitness test in England, due to which he did not feature in the ICC Champions Trophy. “After clearing another test before the squad selection on eve of the ICC Champions Trophy in England, Umar was included in the eventual 15 member squad.

“The PCB wants to stress that the team trainer conducts fitness tests of squad members before each international assignment and the tests before the Champions Trophy were conducted as a continuation of the policy. Once again Umar failed to attain the desired level of fitness and the team management was left with no option but to drop him from the squad.”, the release said.

On Wednesday, Arthur was accused by Akmal of verbal abuse at the National Cricket Academy. “After I recovered, I went to the NCA to start working on my fitness and training but the coaching staff doesn’t want to work with me at all. I then went to talk to Inzi bhai (Inzamam-ul-Haq), but he referred me to Mickey Arthur. Arthur took me back to Inzi bhai’s room and started scolding me and using bad language in front of Inzi bhai, which I found demeaning and insulting. It’s not even my fault, and I find it painful that anyone should be allowed to swear at me,” Akmal told reporters.

“I accept my fitness isn’t up to the mark, and I am trying to work on it, and I asked to be allowed a trainer to help me. But Mickey said I shouldn’t even have come to the NCA, and should be playing club cricket instead. When the head coach is allowed to swear at someone whenever they wish, that is unacceptable.”

Arthur on the other hand, did not agree with Akmal’s allegations, saying: “I never stopped him from using the academy. Umar Akmal cannot expect that the support staff, who are for contracted players, are at his beck and call.”

According to PCB, Akmal was given several chances by Arthur for redemption. “Head Coach Mickey Arthur had placed Umar in his white ball format plans and gave him repeated chances for redemption. Unfortunately though, the batsman remained incapable of reaching the requisite fitness level. The PCB awaits his response to the show-cause issued to him yesterday and hopes that in the meantime, the batsman will refrain from making baseless allegations.”, the release said.

Manager Mark Hughes believes Stoke City have secured an elite player in forward Jese Rodriguez, who joined the team on a season-long loan from Paris St Germain on Wednesday, and says the 24-year-old can excel at the Premier League club.

Former Real Madrid player Rodriguez won multiple titles with the Spanish club before sustaining a serious knee injury in 2014. He failed to re-establish himself after the long injury layoff and joined PSG in 2016.

After an underwhelming start to last season, Rodriguez spent the second half on loan at Spain’s Las Palmas. “I think we can give him a platform here to really enjoy himself. Everyone is excited to see him play,” Hughes told reporters on Friday.

“He’s an elite player, a top-level player and you don’t get too many opportunities to bring players like him to the club. When you do you should enjoy it.”

Rodriguez was Stoke’s sixth recruit in the current transfer window and Hughes says his team are stronger than last season. “It’s always the case in transfer windows that you want to be stronger at the end than the start” Hughes said.

“If you look at the players we let go I would argue that we’ve only let go of one who would be a regular starter, the rest would be squad players.

“But we’ve replaced them with starters. If you compare and contrast with last season I believe we are much stronger.” Hughes also confirmed that forward Julien NGoy has been ruled out for up to six weeks with a thigh injury.

"Defaulters owe 27% of total amount to SBI alone, PNB next","State Bank of India. (File Photo) State Bank of India. (File Photo)

Country’s largest lender SBI accounts for over 27 per cent of the total amount owed to public sector banks by wilful defaulters. As many as 1,762 wilful defaulters owed Rs 25,104 crore to State Bank of India as on March 31, putting pressure on its balance sheet. Punjab National Bank (PNB) is next on the list with 1,120 wilful defaulters having outstanding non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans of Rs 12,278 crore. Together these two banks account for Rs 37,382 crore or 40 per cent of the total outstanding loans.

Total outstanding loans due to public sector banks by wilful defaulters amounted to Rs 92,376 crore, according to the Finance Ministry data. The total outstanding loans by wilful defaulters rose to Rs 92,376 crore at the end of financial year 2016-17, from Rs 76,685 crore at the end of last fiscal 2015-16 — up 20.4 percent. At the same time, there has been close to 10 per cent increase in the number of wilful defaulters on annual basis.It increased to 8,915 at the end of March as against 8,167 in the previous fiscal. Out of 8,915 cases of wilful defaults, banks have filed FIR (First Information Report) in 1,914 cases with outstanding loans of Rs 32,484 crore.

During 2016-17, 27 public sector banks, including SBI and its five associates had written off Rs 81,683 crore, the highest in the last five fiscals. The amount was 41 per cent higher than that in the previous fiscal. Gross NPAs of the public sector banks rose to Rs 6.41 lakh crore at the end of March 2017 as against Rs 5.02 lakh crore a year ago. In order to check incidences of wilful default, RBI has tightened the norms and made it clear that promoter of the defaulting company cannot escape from his responsibility even if he is not a whole time director.

As per earlier guidelines, a bank couldn’t label a non-whole-time director of a company as a wilful defaulter unless there was conclusive evidence that the individual was aware of the wilful default by the company and had not objected to it. A wilful default occurs when a borrower doesn’t honour an obligation despite having the capacity to pay or siphons off funds by disposing of assets without the knowledge of the bank, according to RBI. RBI has allowed banks to name and shame wilful defaulters by publishing their photographs.

Charlottesville Mayor says Lee statue must go as debate over US slave past rages,"Damage is seen to the face of a statue of Confederate commander General Robert E. Lee at Duke University’s Duke Chapel in Durham, North Carolina (Source: Reuters) Damage is seen to the face of a statue of Confederate commander General Robert E. Lee at Duke University’s Duke Chapel in Durham, North Carolina (Source: Reuters)

The mayor of Charlottesville called on Friday for a special session of Virginia’s legislature to let localities decide the fate of Confederate monuments like the statue at the center of a far-right rally last week that turned deadly. Mayor Mike Signer issued his appeal amid an increasingly contentious debate over what to do with memorials to Confederate figures, who fought for the preservation of slavery during the US Civil War, that are seen by opponents as offensive.

In what has become the biggest domestic crisis of his presidency, Donald Trump has been sharply criticized, including by fellow Republicans, for blaming Charlottesville’s violence not only on the white nationalist rally organizers, but also the anti-racism activists who opposed them.

“Whether they go to museums, cemeteries, or other willing institutions, it is clear that they no longer can be celebrated in shared civic areas,” Signer said in a statement, referring to the statues. “We can, and we must, respond by denying the Nazis and the KKK (Ku Klux Klan) and the so-called alt-right the twisted totem they seek.”

A 32-year-old woman, Heather Heyer, was killed and several people were injured when a man crashed a car into a crowd of counter-protesters at last Saturday’s rally. A 20-year-old Ohio man has been charged with her murder. On Friday, he was handed five new felony counts of malicious wounding, with the charges related to serious injuries inflicted on people hit by the vehicle, Charlottesville police said.

Some attendees at the rally were heavily armed, and Signer said in his statement he was also calling for legislation that would let localities ban open or concealed carry of weapons at some public events. And he said he wanted to find a way to memorialize Heyer’s name and legacy.

Heyer’s mother told a memorial service on Thursday that her daughter’s killers tried to silence her. “Well guess what? You just magnified her,” Susan Bro told the service. Signer said that memorial was a profound turning point for him, and that it made him realize the significance of the city’s statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee had changed. “Its historical meaning now, and forevermore, will be a magnet for terrorism,” the mayor said in his statement.

RALLYING POINTS FOR RACISTS

Also on Friday, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe signed an executive order temporarily banning protests at the Lee Monument in downtown Richmond while new regulations governing demonstrations are put in place, the governor’s office said. In many places, Confederate monuments have become rallying points for white nationalists. Efforts to remove many such statues have been stepped up since the Charlottesville rally, which was called by far-right groups to protest against plans to remove the Lee statue.

In Maryland on Friday, authorities took down a statue of a 19th century chief justice, Roger Taney, who wrote an infamous 1857 ruling known as the Dred Scott decision that reaffirmed slavery and said black people could not be US citizens. Trump on Thursday decried the removal of such monuments, drawing stinging rebukes from fellow Republicans in a controversy that inflamed racial tensions nationwide.

The mother of Heyer, the woman killed in Charlottesville, said in a television interview on Friday that after Trump’s comments, “I’m not talking to the president now.” “You can’t wash this one away by shaking my hand and saying, ‘I’m sorry.’ I’m not forgiving him for that,” Susan Bro told ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

There are more than 1,500 symbols of the Confederacy in public spaces across the United States, with 700 of those being monuments and statues, the Southern Poverty Law Center said. The large majority of these were erected long after the Civil War ended in 1865, according to the center, with many going up early in the 20th century amid a backlash among segregationists against the civil rights movement. More than half a dozen have been taken down since Saturday.

Critics cry foul as young Hong Kong democracy leaders get jail,"Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 26, and Nathan Law, 24, were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 26, and Nathan Law, 24, were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly (AP Photo/Vincent Yu)

* Joshua Wong jailed for six months for unlawful assembly

* Jail terms disqualifies trio from running for seats for 5 years

* Terms slammed amid accusations of political interference

A Hong Kong appeals court jailed three leaders of the Chinese-ruled city’s democracy movement for six to eight months on Thursday, dealing a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompting accusations of political interference.

The jail terms will curtail the political ambitions of the trio, disqualifying them from running for seats in the financial hub’s legislature for the next five years.

Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 26, and Nathan Law, 24, were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly, but Hong Kong’s Department of Justice applied for a review, seeking imprisonment.

Wong was jailed for six months, Chow for seven months and Law for eight months. Law had been the city’s youngest ever democratically elected legislator before he was stripped last month of his seat by a government-led lawsuit.

The three appeared stern but calm as their sentences were delivered by a panel of three judges. A lawyer involved in the case said they would appeal. Wong, who was 17 when he became the face of the student-led democracy movement, punched his fist in the air as he left the court room and shouted: “Hong Kong people don’t give up.”

Minutes earlier he Tweeted: “They can silence protests, remove us from the legislature and lock us up. But they will not win the hearts and minds of Hongkongers.” Chow waved at his parents as he left the court. His mother broke down in tears.

The three judges in Hong Kong’s second highest court, the court of appeal, wrote in their judgment that the three could not say they were sentenced for exercising freedom of assembly in a city where many democrats see a gradual erosion of freedoms promised in 1997.

“In recent years, there’s been an unhealthy trend in Hong Kong society. Some people use the pursuit of ideals … as an excuse to take illegal action,” Judge Wally Yeung wrote.

“This case is a prime example of the aforementioned unhealthy trend.”

The former British colony, which has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, was rocked by nearly three months of mostly peaceful street occupations in late 2014, demanding Beijing grant the city full democracy.

The so-called “Umbrella Movement” civil disobedience movement, which drew hundreds of thousands of protesters at its peak, was triggered by Wong and his colleagues storming into a courtyard fronting the city’s government headquarters.

They were later charged with participating in and inciting an unlawful assembly.

Just before sentencing, Wong told over a hundred supporters who thronged into the court lobby, some weeping, that he had no regrets.

“I hope Hong Kong people won’t give up,” he said. “Victory is ours. When we are released next year I hope we can see a Hong Kong that is full of hope. I want to see Hong Kong people not giving up. This is my last wish before I go to jail.”

About 100 supporters later swarmed the prison vans taking the three away from court, shouting slogans, a Reuters witness said. At least one person was taken away by police.

Wong told Reuters on Wednesday that Hong Kong’s democratic movement was facing its “darkest era” and that he’d lost confidence in the city’s independent legal system, long considered one of the best in Asia.

DISSENTING VIEWS

A senior government source who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter said Hong Kong’s top prosecutors had initially “not recommended pursuing” the case further” after the non-jail terms were handed down.

But Hong Kong’s Secretary of Justice, Rimsky Yuen, overruled them and insisted on re-opening Wong’s case, a decision that ultimately led to their imprisonment, the source said.

In response to emailed questions from Reuters to Yuen seeking clarification, a spokesman for the Department of Justice said it “does not comment on internal discussions regarding individual cases”.

“However, the DoJ (Department of Justice) reiterates that all decisions were made in accordance with the Prosecution Code, the applicable law and relevant evidence.”

The DoJ said in an earlier statement there was “absolutely no basis to imply any political motive”.

Critics disagreed.

“From the initial choice to prosecute these young democrats through to today’s hearing, these cases have been shot through by politics, not law,” China director at Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said in a statement.

“That Hong Kong’s courts increasingly appear to operate as mainland courts do is clear evidence that ‘one country, two systems’ is on the ropes – with ominous consequences for all,”

Amnesty International also slammed the jail terms.

“The relentless and vindictive pursuit of student leaders using vague charges smacks of political payback by the authorities,” said Mabel Au, Director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.

Under the “two systems” formula, Hong Kong enjoys a free judiciary, unlike on the mainland where the Communist Party controls the courts which rarely challenge its decisions.

In recent months, dozens of protesters, mostly young people, have been jailed for their roles in various protests, including a violent demonstration that the government called a riot in early 2016. (Additional reporting by Tyrone Siu; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Nick Macfie)

Uber wins U.S. court appeal to push price-fixing case to arbitration,"In a 3-0 decision, the appeals court also said the passenger, Spencer Meyer, agreed to arbitrate his own claims, but could try to show Uber waived its right to arbitration by actively fighting him in court. In a 3-0 decision, the appeals court also said the passenger, Spencer Meyer, agreed to arbitrate his own claims, but could try to show Uber waived its right to arbitration by actively fighting him in court.

Uber Technologies Inc on Thursday won a victory in its effort to keep unhappy customers from suing in court, persuading a federal appeals court to send a Connecticut passenger’s price-fixing case against the ride-service company into arbitration.

Overturning a lower court ruling, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Uber and former Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick properly notified customers in online user agreements that disputes should be arbitrated.

In a 3-0 decision, the appeals court also said the passenger, Spencer Meyer, agreed to arbitrate his own claims, but could try to show Uber waived its right to arbitration by actively fighting him in court.

Brian Feldman, a lawyer for Meyer, in a statement said Uber did waive that right, and “we look forward to pressing ahead with the litigation.” Uber and its outside lawyer welcomed the decision.

“The Second Circuit’s powerful and commonsense opinion will serve to protect online contracting and strengthen commerce nationwide,” the lawyer, Theodore Boutrous, said in a statement. “We are thrilled with the decision.”

Thursday’s closely watched decision was a boost for efforts to enforce arbitration requirements, which are often buried in long lists of terms and conditions that customers never see.

Internet companies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned that a loss by Uber could inhibit growth in mobile commerce and call into question the enforceability of online contracts.

The decision also offered a lift to San Francisco-based Uber, which has been besieged by high-profile problems.

Kalanick resigned as CEO in June after a shareholder revolt, and is the target of a lawsuit by Uber investor Benchmark Capital to force him off the company’s board. Uber also faces sexual harassment and bias accusations by female staff, a federal inquiry into software that helps drivers avoid police, and a trade secrets lawsuit by Google parent Alphabet Inc’s self-driving car unit Waymo.

‘SURGE PRICING’

Meyer accused Uber and Kalanick of conspiring with drivers, whose earnings are shared with Uber, to charge “surge pricing” fares during peak demand periods. He claimed he never saw a hyperlink to Uber’s arbitration requirement when he used his smartphone to sign up.

Internet users often agree to such terms and conditions through “clickwrap” agreements by checking an “I agree” box, or “browsewrap” agreements where terms are posted via hyperlinks.

U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan denied Uber’s request for arbitration in July 2016, saying the company never properly alerted Meyer to its policies. In overturning that ruling, Circuit Judge Denny Chin said typical smartphone users would find the disclosures “reasonably conspicuous,” even on smaller screens common to mobile devices, and Meyer was not excused for not following the hyperlink.

“While it may be the case that many users will not bother reading the additional terms, that is the choice the user makes,” Chin wrote. Rakoff will decide whether Uber waived its right to arbitrate with Meyer.

On Sept. 20, a federal appeals court in San Francisco will hear arguments on whether some Uber drivers can recoup expenses and tips in a class action because they are employees, or must arbitrate their claims.

The case is Meyer v. Uber Technologies Inc, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-2750.

Government extends deadline to file GST returns for July till August 25,"An illuminated Parliament ahead of midinight launch of ‘Goods and Services Tax (GST)’ in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI Photo) An illuminated Parliament ahead of midinight launch of ‘Goods and Services Tax (GST)’ in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI Photo)

The government on Saturday extended the deadline for payment of the goods and services tax (GST) and filing of GST return-3B for July by five days to August 25. The decision to extend the deadline from August 20 came after the GST Network (GSTN) portal faced technical glitches during the day, with several taxpayers complaining about issues ranging from inability to login on the portal to being unable to make the payment through the online banking channel, even after generation of the GST challan.

The government said that they are extending the deadline for GST payment and return filing after receiving requests from taxpayers, tax practitioners, states, including those who have been hit by floods and as technical glitches are being experienced by last minute return filers.On Thursday, the government had extended the return filing deadline for those taxpayers who want to claim transitional input tax credit to August 28 from August 20 notified earlier. The clarification was issued by the finance ministry after concerns were raised by industry that TRANS-I, the form for claiming transitional input tax credit, was not available on the GSTN, yet the deadline for filing GSTR 3B, which is a summary of self-assessed tax liabilities with consolidated details of outward supplies and input credit, was notified to be August 20.

As per Saturday’s finance ministry release, now the deadline has been extended till August 25 for payment of GST as well as filing of GSTR-3B by taxpayers, including those who do not want to avail transitional input tax credit in TRANS-1 form. For those taxpayers, who want to avail transitional input tax credit, the last date for filing of returns will be August 28, as announced earlier, it said.“Since it is the first return to be filed under GST, the taxpayers and the tax practitioners have requested for few more days to file their return. Also, there have been requests from states, which are hit with floods to extend the last date for filing of GST Returns. The state of Jammu & Kashmir has also requested for extension of time because of late passing of their GST ordinance. Some technical glitches are also experienced by last minute return filers,” the release said.

The ministry urged taxpayers not to wait till last date for filing the returns. “In order not to face any last moment technological difficulty in submission of return, all taxpayers are requested to kindly file their return well before 25th/28th of August 2017 and not wait for the last date,” the release said.

Gujarat state board exam papers to give more weightage to subjective,"Following repeated incidents of students scoring above 90 per cent in the objective section and zero in the subjective in the Class X examinations, the state education board is planning to change the examination pattern by giving more weightage to the descriptive questions.

A proposal in this regard has already been discussed in the monthly meeting of the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) in July and it would be further debated for feasibility and implementation in the upcoming meeting of the board this month, officials said.

“The change in examination pattern as a solution to such incidents where students are either dictated answers from outside the examination hall by their school teachers or by other means — which go undetected by the CCTV cameras — has been mooted, and recently discussed at the board meeting. Other factors too have been taken into consideration like such cases being more rampant in the Class X mathematics exam, and in the tribal districts,” said GSHSEB Deputy Chairman R R Thakkar.

Sources said that the idea was suggested by the senior education department officials when the GSHSEB failed to check repeated incidents of copying and other unfair means despite taking several measures like installing CCTV cameras, preparing 15 sets of question papers and even penalising the teachers, if found guilty.

More than the students, the board has been blaming the schools for such cases in order to inflate their overall result and thus receive more grant from the government. According to the education department’s revised rules, grants to schools are based on their Class X board results.

The Class X exam pattern of all subjects was changed to 50:50 objective and subjective in 2011. This was done as per the recommendations of a committee, led by former chief secretary Sudhir Mankad, in a bid to ease stress among students. However, the report had stated that the multiple choice questions should be application-based and have quality to check understanding of concepts among the students.

In 2015 when the GSHSEB set maths paper on this formula, it faced flak for setting lengthy question papers.

Dale Steyn one step closer to international return,"Dale Steyn suffered a shoulder injury against Australia last year. (Source: Express Photo) Dale Steyn suffered a shoulder injury against Australia last year. (Source: Express Photo)

South Africa pace bowler Dale Steyn is all set to return to competitive cricket. He announced on Friday that he will be part of the Multiply Titans in the 2017-18 domestic season. This means that he will end his seven-year partnership with Cape Cobras.

The 34-year-old, who suffered a shoulder injury against Australia last year, has missed his team’s matches since then and is looking to make a comeback into the side. He has joined a team with which he began his pro career in 2003-04.

“It was an easy decision for me,” Steyn said on Friday. “The luxury of playing for South Africa is that you get to nominate which franchise you want to play for.

“The Titans laid down the platform for where I am now. I think the most important thing that I learnt at the Titans were the basics and it is something I still go back to every time I play international cricket. It was a great place to start playing cricket and it’s going to be a great place to go back to.”

At the Cobras, Steyn will be joined by former South Africa wicket-keeper and teammate and current coach of Titans Mark Boucher. He expressed his happiness at getting Steyn in his team. “The experience he’ll bring to the side will provide the youngsters the opportunity to learn from him,” Boucher said.

“I want to get the best out of him, not only for himself but if Dale is playing good cricket then South African cricket is in good a position. If we can give him an opportunity to show case his skill and hopefully try work his way back into the Protea side then that will be great.”

South Africa, who recently lost a four-match Test series 3-1 against England, will host Bangladesh, India and Australia in coming time and Steyn’s comeback can be a big boost for them.

"300-bed neuro, mother and child care centre at PGI gets health ministry nod, work likely to start in 3 months","Both projects will come up at the cost of Rs 485 crore and Rs 495 crore respectively, a PGI official said. Both projects will come up at the cost of Rs 485 crore and Rs 495 crore respectively, a PGI official said.

Having got the nod of the standing finance committee of the Union Health Ministry, the work to setup a 300-bed Neuroscience centre and an Advance Mother and Child Care Hospital at PGI is likely to start within three months.

Confirming the development, PGI officials said that after a wait of so many years, the Institute has finally received the final nod from the health ministry. A senior PGI official told Chandigarh Newsline on Saturday that the approval was accorded during a meeting, which was held in New Delhi on Friday and was attended by officials from the institute and senior health ministry officials.

The official said that both projects will come up at the cost of Rs 485 crore and Rs 495 crore respectively. “We will now wait for the letter to come from the ministry. The next procedure would be to select a company for the construction process,” said the official, adding that the work is expected to begin within 90 days.

From the date of construction work, the two crucial projects are expected to come up in approximately 39 months. “The much awaited Neurosciences and Mother and Child Care centres will soon become a reality,” said a PGI doctor. On Friday, the SFC also gave its nod to the satellite centre at Una in Himachal Pradesh. “It will be however subject to certain formalities,” said the PGI official. The Una centre will come up at the cost of Rs 495 crore.

PGI had recently announced to setup another satellite centre at Una. Earlier, during the governing body meet of the Institute, it had proposed the same centre at Baddi. It was however shifted to Una. Recently, a PGI team also visited Una to inspect the proposed spot, where the centre is expected to come up.

Hamburg SV winger Nicolai Mueller will be sidelined for about seven months and will need surgery after tearing a cruciate ligament while celebrating a goal during the side’s opening Bundesliga game on Saturday.

The 29-year-old Mueller scored the only goal of the match against Augsburg but as he raced towards the corner flag to celebrate with fans he stumbled over it and fell, tearing his ligament in the process.

He tried playing on but had to be taken off.

“This diagnosis is a big shock for us all and a heavy blow for Nicolai at the start of the season,” Hamburg sports director Jens Todt said on Sunday after a medical check on Mueller.

Saturday’s win was the first for Hamburg at the start of the season in seven years with the former European champions having narrowly avoided relegation in three of the last four seasons.

Consumer forum orders travel company to pay Rs 2.85 lakh to complainant,"(Representational Image) (Representational Image)

THE DISTRICT Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum II has directed Thomas Cook, a travel company, to refund Rs 2.85 lakh for failing to arrange visa for a Panchkula-based family. The complainant, Rajesh Datta, a resident of Sector 4 in Panchkula, had booked a tour of Europe for 15 days and 14 nights from June 20, 2015, for Rs 8.23 lakh from Thomas Cook and according to the terms and conditions, the package was for all passengers, including wife, son and daughter of the complainant and it was inclusive of visa, air fare, stay, meals, sightseeing, etc.

Datta had paid Rs 4 lakh to Thomas Cook and thereafter, the booking confirmation was issued to the complainants on May 18, 2015. Then, on June 13, the company demanded the balance of Rs 4.23 lakh and a mail from Thomas Cook to Datta stated that till June 13, the UK visa was ready but not the Schengen Visa. The complainant, however, deposited the balance amount of Rs 4.23 lakh.

Meanwhile, just three days prior to the tour slated to begin on June 17, 2015, the complainant received information that their Schengen Visa had been rejected by the Italian embassy because “information submitted regarding the justification for the purpose and conditions of intended stay were not reliable”.

According to the complaint, the Embassy of Italy, while rejecting the applications of the complainants for visa, had given an option to appeal to the Administrative Regional Tribunal (TAR) of Lazio within 60 days from the notification of refusal. But Thomas Cook, which was bound to arrange visa for the Dattas, did not take any step to file an appeal before TAR against the orders of refusal.

The complainant, however, requested the company for a refund of the amount, whereupon the latter refunded Rs 5.39 lakh after deducting Rs 2.85 lakh. The complainants made several requests to the company for a refund of the balance, but all in vain. Following this, the complainant moved the consumer forum. The consumer forum, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, directed Thomas Cook to refund Rs 2.85 lakh to the complainant within a month.

"Bimal Gurung, others booked for blast in Darjeeling","Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) chief Bimal Gurung Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) chief Bimal Gurung

A high intensity blast shook Darjeeling’s Chowkbazar in the wee hours of Saturday, the first such incident since the indefinite shutdown to press for a separate state of Gorkhaland began in the Hills over two months ago. Following this, police booked Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Bimal Gurung and several others under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for their alleged involvement in the blast. Though no casualty was reported, police said several shops were destroyed due to the explosion that took place around 12.50 am in front of the old supermarket near Singamari Motor Syndicate in Chowkbazar.

“We have recovered some wires from the spot, which establishes that it was an IED explosion. Prima facie we suspect that Gorkha leaders, namely Bimal Gurung, Prakash Gurung and Praveen Subba, were behind the explosion. They are basically trying to create panic among the people of Darjeeling,” Darjeeling SP Akhilesh Chaturvedi said. Demanding an NIA probe, GJM claimed the blast was executed by those who are not in favour of Gorkhaland. “We believe it was the handiwork of those who do not want Gorkhaland to be formed,” Gurung said. Meanwhile, one civic police personnel was killed in a grenade attack on Kalimpong police station, Darjeeling Range IG Manoj Verma said.

"‘Category-wise’ admissions begin: For aspirants, every second counts","The admission has been divided into three categories based on the percentage of marks in Class X examinations. (Express Photo) The admission has been divided into three categories based on the percentage of marks in Class X examinations. (Express Photo)

As online admissions to the first year junior college (FYJC) begin Sunday on the “first-come, first served” basis, aspirants run the risk of missing a seat by a matter of seconds. The admissions, set to take place online, have been divided into three categories — First, Second and Third — depending on the percentage of marks received by students in Class X examinations.

Each category of students have been allotted days on which they have to log onto the online Centralised Admission Process (CAP) system to take admissions. All students can log in at the same time or different times and whenever a student logs in, they will be shown the number of available seats in each college. Students will get a chance to take admission into any college of their choice where a vacant seat is showing availability and whoever selects the seats first will get the admission, notwithstanding any other student with a higher score who may wanting the same seat.

The idea hasn’t gone down well with most students who were seen crowding the office of the deputy Director of Education on Saturday. “This is ridiculous? What if my Internet connection is down on that day? Will I be punished for having a slow Internet connection since most of the choice seats would be taken by then?” wondered one of the students. Another student said jokingly that the FYJC aspirants are now making plans to stay up overnight to ensure they get into the system first. “Many a time, they declare the dates, but start the system hours prior to the date. One doesn’t know if it will happen this time too. So, we will start refreshing the admission website from the previous night itself,” said another student.

Meanwhile, the CAP committee released the schedule of admissions, stating that this round would be valid only for those students who have not yet got any allotment in any college, those who did not take admissions, who cancelled admissions at the end of Special Round I or those who were rejected. The overall vacancy list of colleges would be declared on August 20, 5pm.

For Category I of students, those scoring 80 per cent and above are eligible for which the first-come, first-served (FCFS) panel would be made active and students can log onto the website (http://pune.11thadmission.net) using their existing student Login and password to avail the facility. Once allotted seats, students have to confirm admissions until 1 pm on August 22 by approaching the respective junior college. By 5 pm on August 22, the vacancy list for the second category of students (60 per cent and above as well as students from first category who haven’t yet got admissions) would be declared and they would have August 23, 10am to 5pm, to get allotments. The students would then have to confirm admissions by 1 pm on August 24, after which the vacancy list for Category III students (all passed students, along with students of first two categories without admissions) would be displayed.

The FCFS panel for the third category would remain open for three days, from August 26 to 28, 10 am to 5 pm for students to select allotments and then they would have August 28-29, until 5pm to take admission in allotted colleges. The overall vacancy list would be declared on August 30, 5 pm. ‘Sorry, you’re late’ If there are no seats available in the desired college, then the students will get a message, “Sorry, you are late by … seconds,” and you should should try for next colleges.

Sri Lanka vs India: How Sri Lanka can book direct entry into 2019 World Cup,"Sri Lanka will play a five match ODI series against India starting Sunday. (Source: Twitter) Sri Lanka will play a five match ODI series against India starting Sunday. (Source: Twitter)

Sri Lanka were blanked 0-3 in the Test series by India with each game producing a big margin after another. It started with a 304 run defeat, then innings and 53 runs followed by an innings and 171 runs in the third and final Test. It gave India their first away Test series clean sweep and it gave Sri Lanka plenty of headache and reasons to contemplate.

Just six days later, Sri Lanka have to shift their focus from the longest format of the game to the 50 over format all while trying to forget what happened in the Test series. The 50 over format is all the more important for the hosts than the Tests were. A blanking here and Sri Lanka might be facing nervous times in order to qualify for the 2019 World Cup in England. Recent form suggests things are unlikely to go smooth for the islanders. They were beaten 2-3 by 11th ranked Zimbabwe in the most recently concluded series. In their last ten completed matches, Sri Lanka have lost seven of them.

Currently, Sri Lanka have 88 points that makes them eighth in the ICC ODI team standings and they can book a direct slot at the 2019 World Cup should they win at least two matches. At least two match wins, out of five ODIs in the series, will take up Sri Lanka’s points tally to 90 points. Nearest competitors West Indies can at best reach 88 points even if they win their six ODIs – one against Ireland and five against England – before the September 30 cut-off for the tournament. The tournament will see hosts England and seven more top ranked teams gain direction qualification.

In case Sri Lanka win just one game, West Indies can go through on slender decimal points. Again, for that West Indies would have to win all their six ODI matches. Should Sri Lanka get whitewashed by India, again, West Indies can still miss out if they lost to Ireland who are ranked 12th in the table.

Sri Lanka can take heart from the fact that West Indies aren’t in pulsating form either in the 50 over game – unlike their ability to wow in the T20s. In the last five years among full members, their average and run rate is only better than that of Afghanistan, Ireland and Zimbabwe.

"‘Garba entry should be only for those who apply tilak, drink Panchagavya’: Hindu Utsav Samiti","Representational Image/ Express Representational Image/ Express

Soon after Hindu Utsav Samiti (HUS)’s demand that Aadhaar card be made compulsory to keep non-Hindus away from Garba pandals, Sanskriti Bachao Manch (SBM) on Saturday demanded that entry should be given only if participants produce the unique identity number, apply tilak on forehead and drink Panchagavya. Panchagavya is a concoction of cow milk, urine, dung, curd and ghee. “Drinking Panchgavya cleanses one’s soul. Hinduism lays emphasis on it but Muslims won’t drink it and will be found out,’’ convener of SBM Chandrashekhar Tiwari told The Indian Express. He claimed Muslim boys “infiltrate” garba pandals and “trap” Hindu girls as part of “love jihad”.

The Bhopal-based organisation said it had appealed to parents through religious and social groups on WhatsApp to instruct their daughters to choose garba partners only after knowing their real identity and background. He said he has also appealed garba organisers to allow only religious songs at the venue.

The SBM claims membership of over 500 in the Madhya Pradesh capital. From anti-Pakistan protests to fashion shows to pro-Hindu causes, its volunteers often take to the streets. It has also protested against “indecent” hoardings near a government college for girls. Tiwari earlier headed Bajrang Dal. He said Islam does not allow idol worship and yet Muslim boys insist on entering garba venues because “they have evil designs”. When asked whether Hindu youths would be asked to taste Panchgavya, he claimed they would not refuse because they are used to it having it during religious events at home.

The United Nations says attacks against aid workers are increasing in South Sudan. A statement by the humanitarian coordinator there, Serge Tissot, says the attacks also put millions of South Sudanese in peril amid the country’s civil war. Millions face severe hunger.

The world’s youngest nation has become one of the most dangerous places for aid workers to operate. Eighty-two have been killed since 2013, including 15 this year. Many are local workers. The UN says attacks include the looting of warehouses and trucks and the loss of tons of food aid.

The world body has repeatedly asked South Sudan’s government to better protect aid workers and let them do their jobs without restrictions. Government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny says it is “unbecoming” to think authorities are targeting aid workers.

On Love and Desire,"Amitava Kumar during his book Launch ‘The Lovers ‘ in New Delhi on Wednesday, Auguct 09, 2017. (Express photo by Abhinav Saha) Amitava Kumar during his book Launch ‘The Lovers ‘ in New Delhi on Wednesday, Auguct 09, 2017. (Express photo by Abhinav Saha)

Amitava Kumar’s new novel maps the journey of a young man, Kailash, in “Reagan’s America” as he searches for love and meaning in life. Woven within the fabric of a larger political narrative, Kumar calls The Lovers (Aleph Book Company, Rs 599), an “in-between novel” — somewhere between fiction and non-fiction. “It speaks about the current situation, in the sense that it gives immigrants a voice. Not just a voice but a voice on their own terms. My narrator doesn’t simply declare his right to live there, he wants the right to love too,” says Kumar, who recently launched the book in Delhi.

In The Lovers, Kumar says, he has written about love and desire like never before. “I am getting old and I thought the body forgets. Through this book, I wanted to remember who I was. When I went to the US, I always thought that I would come back soon, but time kept passing. So I also thought that I must write about my life in the US, the 30 years that I have been there,” says Kumar, whose previous books include Home Products (2010) and non-fiction works such as Husband of a Fanatic (2004) and Passport Photos (2000), among others.

In the novel, Kailash’s professor and mentor, Ehsaan Ali, plays a pivotal role. Ali’s character was inspired by political scientist and anti-war activist Eqbal Ahmad, who was born in Bihar and moved to Pakistan after Partition. Ahmad studied in the US and ended up teaching there. “I never met him, but he has been an inspiring figure for me, not only because he was born in Bihar but because he embodied a radical cosmopolitanism,” says the Arrah-born author.

In the US and the UK, the book has been published with a different title — Immigrant, Montana. “I think it was David Davidar who chose this title (The Lovers). I like it because my narrator says he tore out a page from a magazine in the library that had Picasso’s The Lovers printed on it. This was the painting that Picasso did after first making love,” says Kumar, 54, who is currently the Helen D. Lockwood Professor of English at Vassar College in New York’s Poughkeepsie.

As a graduate student in the US in the late 1980s, Kumar maintained a journal that has served as inspiration for the novel. “I saved many letters from that time, some of them were written by women, which I was surprised to discover. It also includes some letters by my mother. But reading those letters was depressing — the past coming back at you like that. So I left those. Instead, I used to read the book My Mistress’s Sparrow is Dead, a collection of short stories. I read one story each day and wrote the next day. In other words, I used literature to call back some memories and also imagine other things,” he says.

The United Nations says the death toll from Sierra Leone’s mudslides is now above 400. The U.N. humanitarian agency says 409 bodies have been found after flooding and mudslides in the West African nation’s capital of Freetown on Monday morning. Burials have begun as an estimated 600 people remain missing. People continue to search through tons of mud and debris amid the threat of further mudslides.

The government has warned residents to evacuate a mountainside where a large crack has opened. Rainfall remains in the forecast for the coming days, slowing recovery efforts. Thousands of people have lost their homes. Some critics accuse the government of not learning from past disasters.

Many poor areas are near sea level and lack good drainage. The capital also is plagued by unregulated construction.

“NEK CHAND was a man who was in sync with God and nature. He had an eye for art and everything beautiful and unique,” says Major Rajinder Singh Virk, recalling the long association he had with the creator of the Rock Garden. A childhood friend of Nek Chand’s son Anuj Saini, Maj Virk refers to Nek Chand as uncle, someone he knew since his childhood.

“I was witness to the years the Rock Garden was being created and saw the artist at work, viewing his thoughts and ideas come to life. He would ride a bicycle to work and greet everyone who came to visit him with an open heart,” smiles Maj Virk, whose home in Sector 8, Chandigarh, reflects the works of Nek Chand, with parts of the home done up with ideas similar to Nek Chand’s creations. “That’s because I built the house with Nek Chand’s ideas and suggestions and I am so proud to say that he was the one who inaugurated my home. His love and presence engulf us and this home always. He was family,” says Major Virk.

Maj Virk’s favourite possessions are of course, sculptures of a chowkidaar and a duck gifted to him by Nek Chand, which find a special place in the open green area, gifted to him in the early 1990s, with a sculpture by Anuj, very similar to Nek Chand’s creation, using broken tiles, cement, colourful mosaic, et al, also close to his heart. “The piece is a proof of the father and son’s bond as Anuj has been closely associated with uncle and his work,” says the major.

An art and nature lover himself, Maj Virk reflects that Nek Chand’s art, love, friendship have enriched his life and being in many ways, describing the artist as, “a happy-go-lucky man who stayed happy and loved making others happy. I remember the joy on his face to date when he was awarded a bicycle and was so ecstatic riding it. He was a man of simple tastes, someone I idolise, with his determination an inspiration to one and all. It was his hard work and focus that made him achieve the goal of his life and made Rock Garden a reality. He never lost touch with his life and was a person with a calm mind. Even in his last days, Nek Chand never lost touch with the Rock Garden, visiting the place daily. Nek Chand’s heart and soul resides in the Rock Garden”.

Saudi coalition attacks killed children in Yemen: UN chief Antonio Guterres,"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. (Source: Reuters/File) United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. (Source: Reuters/File)

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says in a draft report that the Saudi-led coalition was responsible for more than half the children killed and injured in Yemen’s civil war last year. The report, obtained yesterday, said the United Nations verified 1,340 casualties and attributed 683 — representing 51 per cent — to attacks carried out by the coalition. It said nearly three-quarters of attacks on schools and hospitals, 38 of 52, were also carried out by the coalition.

The draft report on children and armed conflict echoes similar findings from last year when the US-backed coalition was put on a UN blacklist for violating child rights. It was removed by then Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon after Saudi Arabia and other coalition supporters threatened to stop funding many UN programs.

But Ban said he stood by the report, which said the UN verified a total of 1,953 youngsters killed and injured in Yemen in 2015, a six-fold increase compared with 2014. Foreign Policy magazine reported on Wednesday that Virigina Gamba, the new UN special representative for children and armed conflict, intends to recommend that the Saudi-led coalition be added to the list of countries that kill and maim children.

UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters yesterday that Guterres hasn’t seen the draft report that was leaked. He said its contents are still under discussion and the decision of who will be on the blacklist is up to him. Haq said Guterres is scheduled to meet Gamba today but the report isn’t expected to be completed for another month.

Saudi Arabia’s UN Mission said in a statement that the coalition maintains its position “that there is no justification whatsoever for including its name in the annex of the secretary-general’s report on children and armed conflict.” “We trust that the United Nations will make the appropriate decision on this matter,” taking into consideration an ongoing review with the UN and “the positive exchange of information” on the coalition’s activities, the statement said.

Yemen, which is on the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has been engulfed in civil war since September 2014, when Houthi Shiite rebels swept into Sanaa and overthrew President Abed-Rabbo Mansour Hadi’s internationally recognized government.

In March 2015, the Saudi-led coalition began a campaign against Houthi forces allied with ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh in support of Hadi’s government. Since then, the Iranian-backed Houthis have been dislodged from most of the south, but remain in control of Sanaa and much of the north.

Top 20 per cent higher education campuses to have greater autonomy: Prakash Javadekar,"Javadekar used the words “trust”, “free from government’s clutches” and a “fund and forget” philosophy to underline the policy. (File Photo) Javadekar used the words “trust”, “free from government’s clutches” and a “fund and forget” philosophy to underline the policy. (File Photo)

The top 20 per cent of higher education institutions in the country deserved more autonomy and the government would work towards exempting them from UGC’s review mechanism, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar told The Indian Express on Friday. Javadekar used the words “trust”, “free from government’s clutches” and a “fund and forget” philosophy to underline the policy.

All higher education institutions, Javadekar said, will be divided into three categories, with the top 20 per cent enjoying greater academic freedom, the next 40 per cent with relatively more regulations, and the remaining 40 per cent that will remain under the UGC’s regulatory control. The top 20 per cent will be chosen on the basis of the NAAC grading system scores.

“Trust is important,” Javadekar said. “Educational institutes of eminence across the world are free from government clutches. The Parliament and the government (in our country) are now following a new philosophy of fund and forget.” He said: “The top 20 per cent on the institutions will have close to 80 per cent of the academic freedom that we have agreed to bestow on IIMs under the new IIM Bill, which is tabled in Parliament.”

The plan to set up 20 world-class institutions — 10 government-run and 10 private — also fits into the above philosophy, according to Javadekar. The 20 will be known as “institutions of eminence”. “By April 2018, these 20 world-class institutions will come into being. I’m doing weekly follow-up (meetings) of all developments. The advertisement (calling for applications) will be issued this month. Meanwhile, an empowered committee will be constituted by a group that would have the cabinet secretary, higher education secretary and the UGC chairman,” he said.

Javadekar said this group “will identify five to six persons of eminence who will vet applications and choose the 20 world-class institutions…. We’ll give them three months for this.” The Institutions of Eminence, also mentioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech, will be set up through a UGC regulation that will provide an enabling architecture to them to emerge as world-class institutions as the country has little representation in international rankings.

When asked if the merger of the AICTE and UGC was part of the ministry’s plan to move towards greater autonomy for educational institutions, Javadekar said there was no such proposal with the government at this moment.

US general reaffirms commitment to Japan amid North Korea tensions,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (Left) and US President Donald Trump (Right). (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E, Pablo Martinez Monsivais, Files) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (Left) and US President Donald Trump (Right). (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E, Pablo Martinez Monsivais, Files)

The top US general restated Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to the security of its close Asian ally, Japan, on Friday amid regional tensions over North Korea, telling his counterpart in Tokyo that “an attack on one is an attack on both of us”. Fears about North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons programmes have grown in recent weeks. Pyongyang has said it was considering plans to fire missiles over Japan towards the US Pacific territory of Guam, although North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appears to have delayed the decision.

US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and their Japanese counterparts agreed at a meeting in Washington on Thursday to work more closely on North Korea. “The most important thing it (the ministers’ meeting) did was reaffirm the primacy of our bilateral relationship here in Asia-Pacific,” US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford said at the start of a meeting with the Chief of Staff of Japan’s Self-Defence Forces, Admiral Katsutoshi Kawano.

“This is a very important time for security in the region and of course we are mostly focused on the threat coming out of North Korea,” Dunford said. “I think we have made it clear to North Korea and anyone else in the region that an attack on one is an attack on both of us.”

Tillerson said in Washington the United States wanted dialogue with Pyongyang, but only if it were meaningful. “Our effort is to cause them to want to engage in talks but engage in talks with an understanding that these talks will lead to a different conclusion than talks of the past,” he said.

In 2005, North Korea reached an agreement with six countries to suspend its nuclear programme in return for diplomatic rewards and energy assistance but the deal later collapsed. Tensions have risen after North Korea conducted two missile tests in July which, like its five atomic bomb tests, were carried out in defiance of international pressure and United Nations resolutions.

US President Donald Trump has vowed not to allow North Korea to develop nuclear missiles that could hit the US mainland but Pyongyang sees its nuclear arsenal as protection against Washington and its partners in Asia. The new US Ambassador to Japan, William Hagerty, said he had arrived at a difficult time and the United States wanted to work with Japan to “calm the rhetoric” over North Korea. “Our alliance is rock solid, in fact in my personal view this is the greatest alliance on earth,” he said as he met Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday.

“Fire And Fury”

Dunford said on Thursday the United States and South Korea would go ahead with joint military drills next week despite pressure from North Korea and its main ally, China, to halt the contentious exercises that Pyongyang routinely describes as preparation for war. North Korea has fired missiles and taken other steps in response to the war games in the past.

Trump warned North Korea last week it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States, prompting North Korea to say it was considering plans to fire missiles towards Guam. Both sides have since tempered their rhetoric somewhat, but with North Korea’s military capabilities growing, Japan has been looking to strengthen its defences.

The Japanese defence ministry wants to introduce a land-based missile defence system called “Aegis Ashore” to address North Korea’s missile threats and has decided to seek funding in the next fiscal year to cover the system design costs, a Japanese defence official told Reuters. “We will absolutely help and what’s most important for ballistic missile defence is that we integrate our capabilities,” Dunford said.

Foreign Minister Taro Kono said in Washington Japan would strengthen its defence posture in response to the North Korean threat and provide $500 million to help boost maritime security in East Asia, where China has been pursuing extensive maritime claims that have angered regional neighbours.

Japan is likely to increase its defence spending at a faster pace in its next five-year plan from April 2019 than the annual 0.8 percent average rise in its current mid-term plan, the Nikkei business daily reported on Friday. Defence officials have said such a rise was desirable but finance ministry officials are cautious because of Tokyo’s mammoth public debt.

North Korea has repeatedly threatened to target Japan, which hosts around 54,000 U.S. military personnel, as well as South Korea and the United States with its missiles. The United Nations approved tough new sanctions against North Korea earlier this month in response to its missile tests, which include a ban on North Korean seafood exports.

China, North Korea’s largest trading partner, has vowed to enforce the new sanctions, as it has done with previous imposts, and says it is ready to pay the price.

State-run Chinese newspaper the Global Times said on its website late on Thursday that authorities in the Chinese border city of Hunchun were negotiating with North Korea about the fate of seafood trucks stuck between the two countries’ customs ports. “The seafood that can’t enter China is ready to be gradually shipped back to North Korea,” a Hunchun official told the paper.

"Lebanese army, Hezbollah declare offensives on Islamic State at Syrian border","Lebanese soldiers stand near artillery ammunition in Ras Baalbek, Lebanon August 17, 2017. (REUTERS/ Hassan Abdallah) Lebanese soldiers stand near artillery ammunition in Ras Baalbek, Lebanon August 17, 2017. (REUTERS/ Hassan Abdallah)

The Lebanese army was targeting Islamic State positions near the town of Ras Baalbek with rockets, artillery and helicopters, a Lebanese security source said. The area is the last part of the Lebanese-Syrian frontier under insurgent control. The operation by Hezbollah and the Syrian army was aimed at Islamic State militants in the western Qalamoun region of Syria, Hezbollah said, an area across the frontier from Ras Baalbek.

A Hezbollah statement said the group was meeting its pledge to “remove the terrorist threat at the borders of the nation” and was fighting “side by side” with the Syrian army. It made no mention of the Lebanese army operation. Any joint operation between the Lebanese army on the one hand, and Hezbollah and the Syrian army on the other would be politically sensitive in Lebanon and could jeopardize the sizeable U.S. military aid the country receives.

Washington classifies the Iran-backed Hezbollah as a terrorist group.

In a recent speech, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Lebanese army would attack Islamic State from its side of the border, while Hezbollah and the Syrian army would simultaneously assault from the other side.

The Lebanese security source said the two offensives were not coordinated. “Each side is working alone,” the source said. But a commander in the military alliance fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad said that “naturally” there was coordination.

Last month, Hezbollah forced Nusra Front militants and Syrian rebels to leave nearby border strongholds in a joint operation with the Syrian army. The Lebanese army did not take part in the July operation, but it has been gearing up to assault the Islamic State pocket in the same mountainous region.

Hundreds of IS fighters are estimated to be holed up in the enclave. “We started advancing at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT),” the Lebanese source said. Footage broadcast by Hezbollah-run al-Manar TV showed the group’s fighters armed with assault rifles climbing a steep hill in the western Qalamoun.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun was following the army operation, called “Jroud Dawn”. “Jroud” refers to the barren, mountainous border area between Lebanon and Syria. Hezbollah has provided critical military support to President Bashar al-Assad during Syria’s six-year-long war. Its Lebanese critics oppose Hezbollah’s role in the Syrian war.

Northeastern Lebanon was the scene of one of the worst spillovers of Syria’s war into Lebanon in 2014, when Islamic State and Nusra Front militants attacked the town of Arsal. The fate of nine Lebanese soldiers taken captive by Islamic State in 2014 remains unknown.

Shi’ite Hezbollah and its allies have been pressing the Lebanese state to normalise relations with Damascus, challenging Lebanon’s official policy of neutrality towards the conflict next door.

US President Donald Trump recently called Hezbollah “a menace” to Lebanon and the region during a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri in Washington last month, and promised continued US support for the Lebanese army.

"Protesters block traffic, throw stones at cops, damage police vehicle","People block road at Manimajra on Saturday. (Express Photo by Jaipal Singh) People block road at Manimajra on Saturday. (Express Photo by Jaipal Singh)

AGITATED OVER the death of 50-year-old Dharam Singh, a resident of Madi Wala Town in Manimajra and accusing Chandigarh Police of conducting a biased investigation, family members of the victim, along with more than hundred others, staged a protest, blocking traffic and pelting stones at police, damaging a PCR Gypsy at Manimajra on Saturday.

Dharam Singh, along with his uncle Satnam (45), were thrashed by more than half-a-dozen youths, including five identified, near his house on August 14. The two were taken to Civil Hospital, Manimajra, and discharged later. On Friday, Dharam’s condition deteriorated and he was declared brought dead at GMCH-32. He is survived by his wife and three children.

The situation took a violent turn when Dharam’s family members demanded the addition of murder charges against the assailants. But the Chandigarh Police turned down their demand, saying Dharam might have died of excessive consumption of alcohol. The protesters blocked the traffic on Manimajra road starting from the railway crossing to Shivalik Garden, which is barely 100 metres from Manimajra police station. Later, murder charges were added in the FIR.

“All the assailants were drug addicts and two of them, Gurpreet Singh, alias Madu, and Chattu, who are residing in our locality, used to sell drugs in the residential area. Dharam Singh and I raised objections against them and also complained to the police but all in vain. On August 14, Gurpreet, along with others, attacked us on the street. They were armed with sharp weapons. We were rescued by the neighbours,” said Satnam, Dharam’s uncle and auto driver.

“When we rushed to the local police station after the death of Dharam Singh to lodge a case against the assailants, SHO Harminderjeet Singh refused to listen to our plight,” he added. Police sources said though Satnam received sharp injuries in the rear, Dharam was injured in the head. The two were rushed to Civil Hospital, Manimajra, and discharged after preliminary treatment.

Inspector Harminderjeet Singh, SHO of Manimajra PS, said, “We have registered a case and arrested three of the assailants. The main accused, Gurpreet Singh, alias Madu, along with another person, is still absconding. We have added murder charges in the FIR. The post-mortem will be conducted on Sunday.”

The three arrested assailants are Harjeet, alias Sonu, Gurjeet and Preet. Those absconding are Gurpreet and Chattu. Earlier, a case under charges of rioting, assault and criminal intimidation was registered at Manimajra PS. On Saturday, murder charges under Section 302 IPC were added in the FIR.

"Run-up to Bypoll: As BJP intensifies Bawana campaign, Delhi unit president Manoj Tiwari ‘attacked’","Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari in Bawana on Saturday. Express Photo by Amit Mehra Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari in Bawana on Saturday. Express Photo by Amit Mehra

On Saturday, the BJP’s campaign in Bawana, just ahead of the bypoll on August 23, began with public meetings denouncing the AAP and leaders having lunch with a Dalit family. It, however, culminated with an alleged attack on Delhi unit president Manoj Tiwari at Jhanda Chowk.

Besides its Bawana candidate Ved Prakash and the Delhi BJP president, Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan, and MPs Udit Raj, Ramesh Bidhuri, Parvesh Verma were in Bawana during the campaign on Saturday.

While the party’s official statement described the campaign as ‘more intense’, the day, the party said, ended on a contentious note when Tiwari was allegedly attacked with “stones” and “sharpened wood”.

According to a BJP spokesperson, “A little while ago, stones and a piece of sharpened wood were thrown at Manoj Tiwari while he was on stage. It appears that the political opponents, sensing defeat in the electoral fight, are resorting to violence now.”

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Rohini), Rishi Pal, said they received a written complaint about the attack from a woman party worker.

“In her complaint, she said that a piece of wood, and stones were thrown at Manoj Tiwari, and the piece of wood hit him as well,” said Pal.

He further said that there was a huge crowd due to which the attacker could not be caught. “With the help of recordings, we are trying to identify the attackers,” Pal added.

Reacting to the attack on Tiwari, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said, “The Delhi Police comes under the BJP-led Centre and should immediately investigate the attack.”

Further, he said that the BJP’s ‘intense’ campaign, reflected the party’s own ‘insecurity’. “They have become insecure. Why else would so many senior leaders suddenly turn up to campaign in a place that they have otherwise ignored. In fact, we have learnt that they have got volunteers from Haryana to work here because no one from Delhi was willing.”

Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister and veteran Congress leader, Harish Rawat, said, “The by-election to the Bawana Assembly constituency will not only be a historical election for Delhi, but also for the country, as it is a brave battle to save democracy. The central government has not done anything for the benefit of the poor and the weaker sections in the last three-and-a-half years.”

Tiwari’s electoral campaign was dominated by the binary of “fraud, betrayal and forgery, typified by the AAP”, while maintaining that the “BJP is in the field of election with the principle of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.

Earlier on Saturday, Tiwari and Delhi MP Udit Raj ate lunch with a Dalit family at Poonthkalan, while Balyan addressed two public meetings in Bawana.

“The people of Bawana feel they have been cheated, whereas rest of Delhi is witnessing development. The people of Bawana have been voting for either the Congress party or the AAP during the last two decades but both these parties have betrayed the people,” claimed Balyan.

This Day That Year: Virat Kohli’s special ‘chair’ makes him nostalgic about ODI debut; see pic,"Virat Kohli made his ODI debut on August 18 in 2008 against Sri Lanka as an opening batsman. (Source: Twitter) Virat Kohli made his ODI debut on August 18 in 2008 against Sri Lanka as an opening batsman. (Source: Twitter)

As India and Sri Lanka gear up to face each other in the first ODI, BCCI took fans for a nostalgic ride by tweeting a picture of Virat Kohli’s nostalgic moment when he made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka nine years back in 2008. Kohli took a photo sitting on the same chair on which he sat 9 years ago on his debut match. “Few things never change – only the legend grows. #ThisDayThatYear In 2008, @imVkohli sat on this very chair during his debut game #SLvIND.”, BCCI wrote.

Virat Kohli made his ODI debut on August 18 in 2008 against Sri Lanka as an opening batsman. He was only able to score 12 runs before being dismissed by the Lankan pacer Nuwan Kulasekara. It was the first match of the ODI series where India was bundled out for mere 146 runs in 46 overs, with Yuvraj Singh being the highest scorer for the side with 23.

Sri Lanka clinched that match easily by eight wickets, but since then Kohli has never looked back and has only continued to progress, leading Team India to countless victories. His record against Sri Lanka has been very impressive as he has smashed six ODI centuries against the hosts.

Kohli’s most impressive knock against Sri Lanka came in the year 2012 when he hammered 133 runs off just 86 balls, taking India to a thrilling win, chasing 321 in just 36.4 overs.

Nigeria’s freed Chibok girls to return home ‘fully recovered’,"“All the 106 girls are now fully recovered, ready for re-integration with their families and the larger society, and to go back to school,” Aisha Jummai Alhassan, minister of women affairs, told a news conference.

(Source: AP Photo/File)

More than 100 girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants in the Nigerian town of Chibok in 2014 are ready to return to normal life after being released and receiving psychological and medical treatment, the government said on Friday. Some 270 girls were originally abducted by the Islamist group but 82 were freed in May this year after mediation, adding to 24 who were released or found last year. The girls have been receiving psychological and medical care in the capital, Abuja, as part of a government rehabilitation programme.

“All the 106 girls are now fully recovered, ready for re-integration with their families and the larger society, and to go back to school,” Aisha Jummai Alhassan, minister of women affairs, told a news conference. “They are now stabilised and most of their traumatic stress disorder symptoms have been overcome and previously frequent incidents of flashbacks, insomnia and nightmares have now been successfully brought under control,” she said.

Some of them underwent surgery, and a prosthetic limb was provided for a girl who lost a leg while in captivity. Four babies were also said to be in good health. Of the 270 girls who were originally taken, about 60 escaped soon afterwards but around 100 are still believed to be in captivity. Alhassan said negotiations to secure their release were ongoing.

Boko Haram has killed more than 20,000 people and displaced more than two million during an eight-year insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria. The Chibok case provoked global outrage and a celebrity-backed campaign to raise awareness of the girls’ plight, but aid groups say Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands more adults and children, many of whose cases are neglected.

A United Nations human rights committee called in July for Nigeria’s government to step up efforts to rescue all women and girls abducted by Boko Haram and ensure they returned to school without stigma.

The triumph and tragedy,"No sooner had the celebratory lights of Independence Day been extinguished that Delhi was plunged into the darkness of unprecedented communal violence. No sooner had the celebratory lights of Independence Day been extinguished that Delhi was plunged into the darkness of unprecedented communal violence.

Seventy years ago on August 15, 1947, I mingled with jubilant crowds in the streets of Delhi. The Union Jack was lowered, the Indian tricolour fluttered in the air. I was a 16-year-old girl in a unique moment in our history.

It is impossible to convey the sense of pride I felt to the present generation who did not have to endure the humiliation of living in a subject nation. I felt the elation of a long-cherished dream come true. Mounted police were trying to keep a semblance of order. A stranger saved me from being trampled by a horse. The whole scene around me was hazy with the dust kicked up by the gathering. It is engraved in my memory like an Impressionist painting.

Growing up in enslaved India, I witnessed our journey towards freedom. I saw the exhilaration of the Quit India movement of 1942 and the misery caused by the Bengal famine of 1943. In the winter of 1945 the saga of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and his Indian National Army took the country by storm during the Red Fort trial of three officers — a Hindu, a Muslim, a Sikh.

It was a personal tryst with destiny that enabled me to be in Delhi at the moment of Independence. I was born in Dhaka and grew up in Calcutta. After my school-leaving exam, I had come to spend a holiday in Delhi with the family of my paternal uncle Nirad C. Chaudhuri. Uncle Nirad was an admirer of the British Empire. As August 15 approached, I felt apprehensive I would not be allowed to take part in the Independence festivities. However, Uncle Nirad said that if I wished to join the “mafficking” I was free to do so.

I was overjoyed. At midnight on August 14-15, I went to our neighbour’s flat and listened to Nehru’s moving “tryst with destiny” speech. Early next morning I went out with my two cousins, Dhruva and Kirti, to take part in the popular celebrations. Late into the night, utterly exhausted, we trudged back towards home. The roads were by now deserted but all the houses were lit up with lamps as if it was Diwali. Kirti broke the silence of the night by reciting Tagore’s famous poem Shah Jahan: “Gone are you today, O Emperor, your empire has vanished like a dream, your throne lies in ruins.” The poem goes on to say that the memories of the mighty soldiers whose footsteps shook the earth now mingled with the dust on the streets of Delhi. We related this poem to the fall of the once invincible British raj.

No sooner had the celebratory lights of Independence Day been extinguished that Delhi was plunged into the darkness of unprecedented communal violence. Smoke billowed from devastated neighbourhoods.

One morning in late August, my two cousins and I got into trouble as we were cycling towards All India Radio. My cousin Kirti said, “Didi, mind your sari, people are staring at you.” But it was not a case of my sari billowing in the wind. We were soon stopped by the military police. They told us a curfew had been imposed and instructed us to get out of the violence-torn locality immediately. I had never cycled so fast in my life. After many detours, we eventually found our way home with the help of a tongawallah.

The train journey back to Calcutta in September 1947 was a nightmare. The Delhi railway station was strewn with dead bodies. After our train started to move I saw human beings being thrown out of the train by miscreants. The goons confronted the three of us as well — my mother and I and a family friend. Had Bengal not been partitioned and the eastern wing of Pakistan created there? So we deserved to be punished. Suddenly a young Punjabi girl — a refugee from Lahore, where she had lost her family in the riots — stood up to defend us. Taken aback by her spirited protest, the goons left in search of other victims. Once the train steamed into Kanpur station, military police surrounded the train and arrested the murderers.

As the train sped through the night towards newly partitioned Bengal, I felt conflicting emotions. The pride and joy I felt with the coming of freedom seemed drowned by deep sorrow as I reflected on the mindless violence wrought by Partition. Seventy years on, we need to draw lessons from both the triumph of freedom and the tragedy of Partition.

Ruthless Borussia Dortmund begin with dominating win,"Borussia Dortmund began the season with a win. (Source: AP) Borussia Dortmund began the season with a win. (Source: AP)

Borussia Dortmund overcame hosts VfL Wolfsburg 3-0 on Saturday to make a flawless start to their Bundesliga season as last season’s runners-up RB Leipzig suffered a shock loss at Schalke 04.

New Dortmund coach Peter Bosz had promised attractive, attacking football and his team, who finished third last season, delivered on his Bundesliga debut.

There was more good news for Dortmund with Mario Goetze making his comeback after half a year out following a metabolic disorder and the Germany international set up 18-year-old Christian Pulisic after 22 minutes for the first goal at the Volkswagen Arena.

The absence of suspended Ousmane Dembele, who missed training last week amid speculation about a possible move to Barcelona, was quickly forgotten as Marc Bartra doubled the lead five minutes later against a dazed Wolfsburg defence.

With the Wolves cornered, Dortmund kept up the pressure and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, last season’s Bundesliga top scorer, added a third on the hour.

“I am very satisfied. A 3-0 win at Wolfsburg is a very good result,” Bosz said. “Overall we delivered a very good team performance and that is important.”

“Christian Pulisic is still very young but he did really well today,” Bosz said of the American teenager. “Not only because of the goal. He was everywhere today.”

Champions Bayern Munich are also on three points after Friday’s 3-1 victory over Bayer Leverkusen. An 84th-minute deflected effort from Andrej Kramaric gave Hoffenheim, who face Liverpool next week for a spot in the Champions League group stage, a 1-0 win over Werder Bremen.

Australian Mathew Leckie struck twice for new club Hertha Berlin as they beat promoted VfB Stuttgart, back after a season in the second division, 2-0.

Schalke, with 31-year-old coach Domenico Tedesco making his Bundesliga debut, scored once in either half to beat Leipzig 2-0 with the visitors’ sensational league run last season already a distant memory.

Nabil Bentaleb put them ahead with a 43rd minute penalty before Yevhen Konoplyanka, who had scored twice in the German Cup on Monday, struck to finish Leipzig off.

Nicolai Mueller’s goal gave Hamburg, who suffered a shock first-round exit in the German Cup last week, a 1-0 win over Augsburg for their first victory at the start of the season in seven years.

Promoted Hanover 96 won by the same scoreline, with Austrian Martin Harnik on target against Mainz 05.

"After Charlottesville, Boston aims to avert violence at ‘Free Speech’ rally","A large crowd of people march towards the Boston Commons to protest the Boston Free Speech Rally in Boston, MA, U.S., August 19, 2017. (Source: Reuters) A large crowd of people march towards the Boston Commons to protest the Boston Free Speech Rally in Boston, MA, U.S., August 19, 2017. (Source: Reuters)

Hundreds of police officers will hit the streets of Boston on Saturday to deter violence at a “Free Speech” rally with right-wing speakers a week after a woman was killed at a Virginia white-supremacist protest. At least 500 police officers, many on bicycles, aim to keep the expected crowd of a few hundred people at the “Free Speech” rally separate from thousands attending a counter-protest by people who believe the event could become a platform for racist propaganda.

Authorities will close streets to avert car attacks like the deadly one carried out in Charlottesville, Virginia, by a man said to have neo-Nazi sympathies against counter-protesters and a similar spate of attacks by Islamist extremists in Europe, most recently Barcelona. After Charlottesville’s bloody street battles, Boston outlawed weapons of any kind – including sticks used to hold signs – in the protest area and ordered food vendors out of Boston Common, the nation’s oldest park.

The violent clashes in Charlottesville, in which one woman was killed in the car rampage, ratcheted up racial tensions already inflamed by white supremacist groups marching more openly in rallies across the United States. White nationalists had converged in the Southern university city to defend a statue of Robert E. Lee, who led the army of the pro-slavery Confederacy during the Civil War, which ended in 1865.

A growing number of U.S. political leaders have called for statues honoring the Confederacy to be taken down, with civil rights activists charging that they promote racism. Advocates of the statues contend they are a reminder of their heritage. Last weekend’s violence sparked the biggest domestic crisis yet for U.S. President Donald Trump, who provoked ire across the political spectrum for not immediately condemning white nationalists and for praising “very fine people” on both sides of the fight.

Beyond the Boston rally and counter-march, protests are also expected on Saturday in Texas, with the Houston chapter of Black Lives Matter holding a rally to remove a “Spirit of the Confederacy” monument from a park and civil rights activists in Dallas planning a rally against white supremacy.

COUNTER-PROTESTERS REJECT PLEA

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh on Friday asked counter-protesters to avoid Boston Common, saying their presence would draw more attention to the far-right activists. “We’re urging everyone to stay away,” Walsh said. Monica Cannon, an organizer of the “Fight White Supremacy” march, rejected that call. “Ignoring a problem has never solved it,” Cannon said in a phone interview. “We cannot continue to ignore racism, ignore white supremacism, ignore neo-Nazis and pretend it’s not a problem.”

Organizers of the “Free Speech” rally denounced the violence and racist chants of the Charlottesville “Unite the Right” protest. “We are a coalition of libertarians, progressives, conservatives, and independents and we welcome all individuals and organizations from any political affiliations that are willing to peaceably engage in open dialogue about the threats to, and importance of, free speech and civil liberties,” the group said on Facebook.

The event’s scheduled speakers include Kyle Chapman, a California activist who was arrested at a Berkeley rally earlier this year that turned violent, and Joe Biggs, formerly of the right-wing conspiracy site Infowars.

"Down in jungleland: A cow and bull story, or how not to attain bovine glory if you’re a rebel animal","(Illustration: Mithun Chakraborty) (Illustration: Mithun Chakraborty)

Recently, my rustic, very organic cousin invited me over to his farm to spend the weekend. When I reached there, I heard his exasperated voice from the large cowshed. I walked up to it and, since the best stories are those that you overhear, began to eavesdrop. And this is what I overheard. My cousin was talking to his cow, Moti, while milking her.

“I don’t care what you think. It’s a done deal. Monday morning and I’m admitting you to the hostel. I’ve already made the down payment on rent and have examined the stalls. They are very comfortable: with air-conditioning, free wi-fi, HDTV, non-alcoholic mini-bar, etc. You will have 24-hour stall service, dung and pee collection (which will be donated to medical labs), and every morning, a member of the staff will come to milk you. We will visit you once a week on the weekends. You’ll be very happy.”

“I don’t want to go to a hostel!” Moti replied mutinously. “You have no idea what the wardens do to inmates in hostels. And everyone knows what hostel food is like!”

“Well, you should have thought about that earlier. You and your friends spend the whole day gallivanting about in the streets, eating rubbish and plastic bags and causing traffic jams.”

“No, we do not! We just lie down in the middle of a highway to do yoga, that’s all. And, for your information, the mere sight of us cows doing the cud-chewing asana, calms the traffic down. Drivers slow down as they try to navigate around us. Sometimes, we bring the traffic to a complete halt for two hours to induce them into a deep coma! We are a beatific influence.”

“That may be, but what about these complaints I’ve received about you being seen in the Glitizzy Mall in the company of a bafellow at night? Not only that, you went into a women’s lingerie store and…” Here my cousin sputtered to an outraged halt. “Have you no sense at all? What were you thinking? What will people say?” he went on.

“They can say and think what they like,” Moti replied, giggling. “You should have seen Bhaisa darling’s face when I came out of the trial room. The dude got so excited that he totaled the Food Court. It was pandemonium!”

“That’s another thing. To be seen going around with a bafellow in the first place.”

“Oh chill, this is the 21st century and we are bovisexuals. Bhaisa’s very sweet, even if a bit thick between the horns. Besides, I have the right to go out with whom I choose.”

“It’s a wonder you were not arrested by the anti-Romeo squads.”

“They wouldn’t dare. You know, we have our own SPG to protect us at all times,” Moti snorted. “You just want to take away our freedom as you have been trying to do with human girls. No going out, no mobiles, no boys within 20 km of the hostel. You can’t wear this, you can’t eat that, you can’t say this, you can’t write that, you can’t see this, you can’t hear that, you can’t have boyfriends, be back by this hour or else. Sorry, but we are not going to be your goongi gudiyas.”

“It’s for you own good!”

“Pah! Besides, we get so much more protection than human girls. If any girl had come out of that trial room looking like I had, even though she had every right to… We can wander the streets all day and night, and no one says or does anything to us, except, maybe, garland us. We can help ourselves to fruits, vegetables and snacks from roadside stalls without asking or paying, and no one dares protest.”

“I don’t want to hear anything more about that lingerie store incident,” my poor cousin said. “I don’t know how I’m going to live it down. Why can’t you be like your lovely step-sister Malti here? She has no problem going to a hostel.’

“Jee papaji,” Malti said in a sweet, low voice, making me wince. “I’m so looking forward to it, but I’ll miss you all so much. But, imagine, to be in a stall all day just ruminating. Can you think of anything more tranquil?”

“Hah! I know what you’ll be ruminating about: those fabulous Jallikattu bulls or some of those jet-black Spanish studs,” said Moti.

“Papaji, tell her. She’s being so mean!”

Then came the sound of a pail being kicked over and a shout from my cousin.

“Moti, you kicked the milk bucket over deliberately. You are impossible!”

“I just don’t think adult human beings should be drinking milk: It’s stolen baby food. No adult animal drinks milk. Really, you people are infantile! Grow up!”

“That’s it! It’s the hostel for you, like it or not!” my cousin snapped. “I hope they’ll teach you to be more respectful towards those who look after you.”

“Bah. Just let them try!” Moti snorted.

“She’s a real feisty one, isn’t she?” I commiserated with my cousin some time later. He nodded.

“Always been a rebel. I just hope she will simmer down in the hostel,” my cousin said.

Later, I checked to find out how the hostel admission process had gone off.

“Oh,” my cousin said lugubriously, “They didn’t admit her. They said her mother probably did some hanky-panky. Basically, that Moti’s cross-bred and has Jersey blood in her, and they’re only admitting wholesome, indigenously-bred khadi cows.” He cheered up. “But they took sweet Malti!”

"$300 million later, Manchester City still striving to fix defense","Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Nicolas Otamendi, Vincent Kompany and Kevin De Bruyne. (Source: Reuters) Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Nicolas Otamendi, Vincent Kompany and Kevin De Bruyne. (Source: Reuters)

Manchester City has spent more than $300 million in an effort to improve its defense since last winning the English Premier League in 2014.

It’s a staggering amount of money _ and still the problem is not fixed.

One of the most surprising moves in the summer transfer window emerged this week when City offered 18 million pounds ($23.2 million) for Jonny Evans, the former Manchester United defender who is club captain at West Bromwich Albion.

West Brom rejected the bid but is braced for another offer from the richest team in England.

“It would be crazy to say a team like West Brom won’t sell if a team are going to put a huge amount of money in front of you,” West Brom manager Tony Pulis said.

The fact that City manager Pep Guardiola feels he still needs to bolster his defense at this late stage of the window highlights the concerns he has about this area of the team. It also underscores the recent failings by those in charge of City’s recruitment.

Eliaquim Mangala arrived from FC Porto for a reported 42 million pounds (now $54.1 million) in 2014. Nicolas Otamendi arrived from Valencia for 32 million pounds (now $41.2 million) a year later. Another center back, John Stones, cost an initial 47.5 million pounds (now $61.2 million) in the summer of 2016 before City turned to signing full backs this offseason.

Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy, and Danilo joined in the space of 10 days in July, for around 120 million pounds ($155 million) in total.

There’s still a wide-held belief that a player signed nine years ago, captain Vincent Kompany, is holding the defense together. For City fans, that is a worry _ given the 31-year-old Belgium center back has been ravaged by injury over the last three years.

Kompany was fully fit in only the final two months of last season _ he played six games in all competitions before April _ and City lost just one of nine league games in that period. Without the captain, the 23-year-old Stones looked lost at times and Otamendi was often out of position and impetuous in the tackle.

Mangala, meanwhile, was out on loan at Valencia and it would be a surprise if he ever featured under Guardiola.

In terms of money paid for a player, the France center back has possibly been the biggest transfer let-down in Premier League history. A combined 80 million pounds for Otamendi and Stones also raised eyebrows.

If Evans does come to City then at least Guardiola has an experienced and reliable center back to fall back on, coupled with the fact he is homegrown which improves City’s quota for European competitions. City started the season playing a three-man defense containing Kompany, Stones, and Otamendi, with the latter two players looking more comfortable with Kompany alongside them.

“I’m not going to say we are going to play all the season in that system, we are going to play different systems,” Guardiola said. “But the fundamentals will be the same.”

Guardiola was forced into an overhaul of his full backs after City released out-of-contract trio Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna, and Gael Clichy in the offseason, and released left back Aleksandar Kolarov for Roma at his own request. Kolarov’s decision came as a surprise to Guardiola, who appreciated the Serbia international’s versatility.

Knowing City’s desperation to fill the void _ particularly after the team missed out on signing Dani Alves, who eventually chose to leave Juventus for Paris Saint-Germain _ Tottenham and Monaco ramped up the asking price for Walker and Mendy, respectively.

“Now the full backs are younger, they have energy in their legs,” Guardiola said last week. It cost City a fortune for the privilege, however.

Letting go four full backs in one summer is an error of judgment and planning, but City has owners who are rich enough to solve the problem.

The full back situation is sorted now. There’s two weeks left to find another center back, and Evans appears to be Guardiola’s preferred solution.

The song that’s India: Revisiting Desh Raag,"(From left) Pt Ravi Shankar on the sitar, tabla maestro Zakir Hussain. (From left) Pt Ravi Shankar on the sitar, tabla maestro Zakir Hussain.

On the morning of August 15, 1989, India woke up to Desh raag, a celebration of the nation through classical music and dance. India, with its newly acquired colour television sets, watched as Pandit Bhimsen Joshi invoked Desh, a soothing late evening raga associated with the monsoons and the Indian national song — Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s Vande Mataram.

Set against a waterfall and majestic mountains, we saw a solemn looking Joshi sing Lab pe jaage geet aisa, Goonje bankar des raag in his sonorous voice to the sounds of a tabla and tanpura. His verses were followed by the doleful strains of a sarangi played by Pt Ram Narayan. There was also sitar maestro Pt Ravi Shankar strumming the seven sitar strings with exuberance, Pt Hari Prasad Chaurasia breathing life into a reed, Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma playing the santoor, M Balamuralikrishna playing the violin and singing Baje sargam in Tamil, and, the famed tabla dual between Ustad Allah Rakha and Zakir Hussain, with the tricolour as the background — all inseparable elements of Desh raag.

The orchestral masterpiece also showcased various classical dance forms through short pieces: Kathak exponent Shovana Narayan danced at Fatehpur Sikri followed by Protima Bedi presenting Odissi on Juhu beach, Mallika Sarabhai giving a glimpse of Bharatanatyam, Kanak Rele presenting Mohiniattam and Swapna Sundari dancing the Kuchipudi.

This was India through sound and video, a glimpse into its rich and diverse cultural fabric. “It was also education. Telling the people about one of India’s most significant pillars — the classical arts,” says Narayan.

Conceptualised by Suresh Mullick, creative director of Ogilvy back then, and directed by Kailash Surendranath for Lok Sewa Sanchar Parishad, the piece was commissioned by the Rajiv Gandhi government “to raise the morale of people in a pre-liberalised India”. It was the third and final piece in a trilogy of short films; the other two being Freedom Run — The Torch Song and Mile sur mera tumhara. “Most of the credit goes to the fine performances of these classical heavyweights and Suresh Mullick who thought of the idea. It came when the economy was underdeveloped, the country was facing unrest and the people needed a unity in diversity message,” says Surendranath about the piece, which was composed mainly by Joshi. It was later put together by prominent jazz musician, Louis Banks. Mullick also got composer P Vaidyanathan and cinematographer RK Rao on board.

For lyrics, Mullick went to one of his own — Piyush Pande. “Baje sargam har taraf se, goonje bankar desh raag, said everything it had to. Suresh was my boss, and very particular. He said we should use analogies, and that people are smart enough to understand that we are talking of integration,” says Pande, now CEO, Ogilvy & Mather.

Surendranath, however, claims that Pandit Vinod Sharma (remembered for writing the popular Nirma advertisement) wrote the famed lines and that Pande didn’t. “Pandit Sharma was a dear associate and friend but he had nothing to do with the lyrics of the trilogy. Suresh is dead now and people want to create some or the other controversy over the piece, but all his old interviews, in great detail, talk about the process of writing both Mile sur and Desh raag and how he had commissioned them to me,” says Pande.

The process of completing the short film took over a month. Long fax messages were constantly exchanged between Banks and Mullick. Cinematographer Rao travelled across the country to shoot the film. “It was the simplicity that worked,” says Rao about the video that quite possibly helped many to grasp that Kathakali and Manipuri were classical art forms and not folk dances.

While Mile sur was about seven minutes long, Desh raag exceeded 13 minutes. Brilliant and technically sound as the piece was, Desh raag found more acceptance in the art circles as compared to the masses. “There hasn’t been a better musical genius than Suresh. But in hindsight, I think he went a little overboard. When the artiste in you gets too involved, that can happen. His artistic leanings resulted in the length becoming a problem. We loved those pieces by the artistes so much that we got carried away and got lost in its brilliance. It’s so beautiful and became extremely popular but not as much as Mile sur,” says Pande about the piece for which no artiste charged any fee.

The final lines of the national anthem were included towards the end of the film and that proved to be an impediment. “The authorities did not like our inclusion of the last bit of the national anthem — an incomplete anthem was considered inappropriate. But we managed to show it to Rajivji who loved it. He did not want anything changed,” says Surendranath.

Judge refuses to end Roman Polanski sex assault case,"Filmmaker Roman Polanski walks on a corridor during a break of a court hearing in Krakow. (Reuters Photo/File Photo) Filmmaker Roman Polanski walks on a corridor during a break of a court hearing in Krakow. (Reuters Photo/File Photo)

A Los Angeles judge on Friday denied the impassioned plea of Roman Polanski’s victim to end a four-decade-old sexual assault case against the fugitive director. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon ruled that Polanski must return to California if he expects to resolve charges of sexually abusing a teen. The Oscar winner fled the country on the eve of sentencing in 1978.

Gordon’s ruling follows a fervent request by Samantha Geimer to end a “40-year sentence” she says was imposed on both perpetrator and victim. It was issued on Polanski’s 84th birthday and blamed the director for the fact that the case was still alive.

“Her statement is dramatic evidence of the long-lasting and traumatic effect these crimes, and defendant’s refusal to obey court orders and appear for sentencing, is having on her life,” Gordon wrote.

Harland Braun, Polanski’s attorney, said the ruling came after the judge asked for proposals on how to resolve the case. Braun’s proposals include several that previously were rejected by the court.

Polanski pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with Geimer when she was 13. She has said he drugged, raped and sodomized her.

The Associated Press does not typically name victims of sex abuse, but Geimer went public years ago.

After he became a fugitive, his attorneys have failed to persuade judges to sentence him in absentia and credit him for the 42 days he was incarcerated for psychological testing before he fled.

Geimer has long supported Polanski’s efforts but made her plea in court for the first time in June. After her statement, the director’s lawyers reiterated their request for the case to be dismissed, or Polanski to be sentenced without appearing in court.

Geimer told the judge that she was deeply disappointed Polanski had not been able to resolve the case with prosecutors and implored Gordon to “bring this matter to a close as an act of mercy to myself and my family.”

Gordon’s ruling Friday noted that a court “may not dismiss the case merely because it would be in the victim’s best interest.”

Geimer has said she was more traumatized by the legal system and the fallout from the case than she had been by Polanski. In downplaying Polanski’s actions, Geimer’s position was at odds with many sexual assault victims and an outcry about lenient sentences in sex abuse cases.

Gordon had praised Geimer for her courage and elegant words but also expressed skepticism that Polanski could resolve the case without appearing in a Los Angeles courtroom.

Deputy District Attorney Michele Hanisee had insisted that Polanski show up in court to face his fate.

Polanski contends that he fled when the original judge in the case suggested in private remarks that he would renege on a plea agreement. It called for no more time behind bars for the director after he spent 42 days in a prison for tests.

Polanski has tried for years to end the case and lift an international arrest warrant that confined him to his native France, Switzerland and Poland, where he fled the Holocaust.

The warrant prevented him from collecting his Academy Award for best director for his 2002 film “The Pianist.” He was also nominated for 1974’s “Chinatown” and 1979’s “Tess.”

Geimer said she didn’t excuse what Polanski did but said she felt he had served his sentence and wasn’t being treated fairly.

Polanski had been shooting photos of the girl at Jack Nicholson’s house when he gave her champagne and part of a sedative pill before raping her in March 1977, according to grand jury transcripts. Nicholson was not home at the time.

Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in exchange for dropping drug, rape and sodomy charges.

Kolkata man held for ‘raping’ minor for over a year after promising break in films,"Accused Sheikh Heyadet Ali is a struggling actor in Bangladesh Accused Sheikh Heyadet Ali is a struggling actor in Bangladesh

A 48-year-old man was arrested by the CID on Friday for allegedly sexually exploiting a minor girl for more than a year with the promise of giving her a break in Television or films. Sources in the police said the accused, Sheikh Heyadet Ali, was apparently a struggling actor in Bangladesh. He was nabbed in Barrackpore by officials of Protection of Women Crime Department of CID.

ADG (CID) Dr Rajesh Kumar told The Indian Express that Ali had been exploiting the girl for the last one year. “It is an important arrest. Ali was also associated with some bars on Kalyani Expressway,” he added.

CID sources said that Ali was a close associate of Sheikh Bachchu, an extortionist who allegedly controls operations in Barrackpore from prison. The accused has been booked under various IPC sections, including 363 (kidnapping), and 376 (rape), sources said, adding that he has been remanded to police custody till August 25, sources said.

CID sources said the 10-year-old girl stays with her mother, a widow, in North-24 Parganas district. Ali, a resident of Naihati, befriended the girl’s mother and promised to give her daughter a role on screen.

“The girl used to call Ali ‘mama’. Ali told the girl’s mother that he would take her along with him to hone her acting skills. She agreed and allowed her daughter to go with the accused. After this, Ali started torturing the girl sexually,” said a source, adding that Ali even shot obscene pictures of the girl.

“He had taken the girl to places like Digha, Dharmatala, Bangaon, Dum Dum and would keep her confined in cheap hotels,” said a source. Ali would allow the girl’s mother to meet her once a month in his presence, sources said. “He would threaten the girl that if she ever opens her mouth he would make the pictures public,” they added.

But, recently the girl managed to come back home and refused to go again with Ali, sources said. When her mother, who was unaware of the ‘sexual abuse’, scolded the girl, saying why she was refusing to go with her ‘mama’, she broke down and narrated her ordeal, said an official. Following this, the girl’s mother lodged a complaint with the CID.

“Ali had plans to go to Bangladesh on Friday. We asked the victim’s mother to call him up and ask him to meet up. The CID officials were stationed in Barrackpore and the accused was arrested as soon as he reached the spot. The case is much more serious than what we thought.

“We found dozens of obscene videos of minor girls in his phones. He also has good connection with several bars and used to supply girls. His arrest may lead us to some more arrests,” said another official.

Barcelona terror attack: Injured included people from Asia,"People stand on the street after a van crashed into pedestrians near the Las Ramblas avenue in central Barcelona, Spain August 17, 2017.

Citizens from four Asian countries — China, Pakistan, Taiwan and The Philippines — were among the over 100 people who were injured in Thursday’s terror attack in Barcelona, the Catalonian Interior Ministry said on Friday. At least 13 people were killed when a van ploughed into pedestrians along the Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday afternoon. The Islamic State (IS) terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Two people are currently in custody but the person who was driving the van is still at large, the police said.

Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported on Friday that two Taiwanese nationals who were part of a tour group were lightly injured. China has also confirmed a victim from Hong Kong received minor injuries as a result of the attack. Authorities in the Philippines confirmed that four members of an Irish-Filipino family were injured in the attack in Barcelona, which is home to around 20,000 Filipinos.

In addition to the Asian nationals, authorities have reported people of various nationalities, including Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Argentine, Venezuelan, Belgian, Peruvian, Romanian, Irish, Cuban, Greek, Macedonian, British, Austrian, Canadian, Ecuadorian, US, Kuwaiti, and Turkish, who were among the injured. Joaquim Forn, the head of Catalonia’s regional interior ministry, told the media that 15 of the injured were in serious condition and that the toll is likely to rise.

The death toll from devastating floods in Sierra Leone has passed 400 while an estimated 600 others remain missing, a senior Red Cross official said today. “Today we are counting more than 400 people dead,” the president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Elhadj As Sy, told reporters in Geneva.

An unofficial morgue toll had previously put the toll at around 400 dead, but the figure had not been officially confirmed. Sy said the government of the West African country was facing a crisis “way beyond (its) capacity” and appealed to the international community to significantly ramp up its support. The displaced are still sleeping outside “because there are not enough shelters for everybody,” he said.

Responding to the crisis that began on Monday will require “a combination of efforts from all people,” he added. The Red Cross said it will launch an emergency funding appeal later today.

Lemons were status symbol in ancient Rome,"The first remains of the earliest lemon, found in the Roman Forum, date to right around the time of Jesus Christ, the end of the first century BC and early first century AD. (Source: Thinkstock Images) The first remains of the earliest lemon, found in the Roman Forum, date to right around the time of Jesus Christ, the end of the first century BC and early first century AD. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Lemons were status symbols for the ancient Roman ruling elite, according to a study which found that they were the first fruits to arrive in the Mediterranean around the time of Jesus. Researchers from Tel Aviv University in Israel studied a collection of ancient texts, art, artifacts and plant remains such as fossil pollen grains, charcoals, seeds.

Until the first century AD, the only citrus produce available to the ancient Romans were the extremely rare and inordinately expensive citrons and lemons, they said. “Today, citrus orchards are a major component of the Mediterranean landscape and one of the most important

cultivated fruits in the region. But citrus is not native to the Mediterranean Basin and originated in Southeast Asia,” said Dafna Langgut, from Tel Aviv University in Israel.

“My findings show that citrons and lemons were the first citrus fruits to arrive in the Mediterranean and were status symbols for the elite,” Langgut said. “All other citrus fruits most probably spread more than a millennium later for economic reasons,” she added.

At first, Romans only had access to rough-skinned citrons, also known as etrogim – mostly rind and dry, tasteless flesh. The citron arrived in Rome from what is now Israel. The earliest botanical remains of the citron were identified in a Persian royal garden near Jerusalem and dated to the 5th-4th centuries BC. It is presumed that it spread from there to other locations around the Mediterranean, researchers said.

“The first remains of the earliest lemon, found in the Roman Forum, date to right around the time of Jesus Christ, the end of the first century BC and early first century AD,” said Langgut. It appears that the citron was considered a valuable commodity due to its healing qualities, symbolic use, pleasant odour and rarity, researchers said.

Only the rich could have afforded it. Its spread therefore was helped more by its high social status, its significance in religion and its unique features, rather than its culinary qualities, they said. Sour oranges, limes and pomelos were introduced to the West by Muslim traders via Sicily and the Iberian Peninsula much later, in the 10th century AD, Langgut said. “It is clear that Muslim traders played a crucial role in the dispersal of cultivated citrus in Northern Africa and Southern Europe,” Langgut said.

Researchers found that the sweet orange associated with Israel today only dates as far back as the 15th century and was the product of a trade route established by the Genoese and, later, the Portuguese. The sticky-sweet mandarin was introduced to the Mediterranean in the beginning of the 19th century, they said. “It wasn’t until the 15th century that the sweet orange arrived on European tables. By the time mandarins appeared in the 19th century, citrus fruits were considered commonplace.

They were cash crops rather than luxury items,” said Lanngut. The study was published in the journal HortScience.

Greece basketball federation accuses Milwaukee Bucks of staging player’s absence,"Giannnis Antetokounmpo posted on Facebook and Instagram that he was unavailable because of a knee injury. (Representational Image) Giannnis Antetokounmpo posted on Facebook and Instagram that he was unavailable because of a knee injury. (Representational Image)

Greece’s basketball federation accused the Milwaukee Bucks and the NBA of hatching a plan to prevent Giannis Antetokounmpo on Saturday from playing in the European championship.

About an hour after Antetokounmpo posted on Facebook and Instagram that he was unavailable because of a knee injury, the federation attacked the Bucks and the NBA in a statement, describing an “organized and well-staged plan” to keep Antetokounmpo from playing in the Eurobasket at the end of the month.

“The simultaneous report by the Milwaukee Bucks and Giannis Antetokounmpo himself, by phone and social media from faraway China, and not by the appropriate official manner, of his inability to join the national men’s team saddens us … but is not surprising,” the federation said in the statement.

“A series of indications … had convinced us of the existence of an organized and well-staged plan by (Antentokounmpo’s NBA) team, with the full knowledge if not encouragement of the NBA that put the athlete on the spot and forced him to announce today that he is no longer part of the men’s national team.”

The federation also said that all details of the story would soon become known. Takis Tsagronis, the federation general secretary, told state TV ERT that a scan revealed no problems with Antetokounmpo’s knee.

“This (the player’s absence) is bad but not unexpected news. All indications were that it would end up like that,” Tsagronis said.

“We, on our side, did everything not to give the Bucks an excuse. We took a magnetic scan of Giannis’ leg and it was clean. What the Bucks claim is not the reality; something else is happening.”

In his Facebook post, Antetokounmpo said he failed to complete physicals because of excessive pain. Antetokounmpo is in China to attend, but not play in, a basketball tournament in Shanghai, as an NBA ambassador.

He was to have rejoined Greece after his China tour to prepare for the Eurobasket starting on Aug. 31, but his knee problems, which forced him to miss all but one of Greece’s warm-up games, alarmed the Bucks, who administered the physical in China.

“It is by far the biggest disappointment in my career,” Antetokounmpo posted, in Greek. “I must deal with the problem. Last year, I could `freeze’ the deal on my new extension contract. This year, I have no choice.”

As if anticipating the questions over his absence, Antetokounmpo added: “I ask everyone not to make of my absence more than it already is, and focus instead on the guys who will fight at the Eurobasket for a success that has eluded us for years.”

Antetokounmpo’s new four-year, $100 million contract with the Bucks begins in September. Last season in the NBA, he finished in the top-20 in total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.

"Iraqi forces ready for next battle against Islamic State extremists, says US","The upcoming fight follows weeks of Iraq regrouping troops and repairing equipment and weapons after recapturing Mosul in July. (File Photo) The upcoming fight follows weeks of Iraq regrouping troops and repairing equipment and weapons after recapturing Mosul in July. (File Photo)

Senior US military leaders said today that Iraqi forces are largely set for their next major campaign against Islamic State extremists after closing out the wrenching nine-month battle to retake the city of Mosul. Lt Gen Stephen Townsend, the top US commander in Iraq, said he sees the Iraqi assault on the IS-held area of Tal Afar “unfolding relatively soon.” The upcoming fight follows weeks of Iraq regrouping troops and repairing equipment and weapons after recapturing Mosul in July. “I can’t say that we replaced every single damaged orbroken vehicle or rifle or machine gun,” said Townsend, whose forces are aiding the Iraqi military. But, he insisted: “They’ll be ready enough.”

Tal Afar and the surrounding area is among the last pockets of IS-held territory in Iraq after victory was declared in Mosul, the country’s second-largest city. Tal Afaris west of Mosul and about 150 kilometers (93 miles) east of the Syrian border. It sits along a major road that was a key IS supply route. Mosul took a heavy toll on Iraqi forces. As many as 1,400 troops were killed and more than 7,000 wounded, and the Iraqi military has proceeded methodically since its biggest success to date.

Just three years ago, its soldiers were chased by the Islamic state group from much of the battlefield. “The last days of Mosul looked like Iwo Jima to me,” Townsend told a small group of reporters. “In the end, it took bulldozers plowing ISIS fighters under the rubble,” he recalled, using multiple different acronyms for the extremist group. “Iraqi infantry men advanced beside the bulldozers, shooting and throwing grenades at Daesh fighters popping up out of the rubble.” Iraiqi Humvees emerged shot up, their glass spider-webbed with bullet marks and shrapnel, their weapons worn out or even destroyed. In the weeks since, much of the Iraqis’ equipment has been repaired or replaced, said Gen. Joseph Votel, America’stop Middle East commander who spent the last few days in Iraq. “I think they are ready,” Votel told reporters Friday,echoing Townsend. The key priority, he said, is ensuring the Iraqis maintain momentum and have a good battle plan, and thatthe US-led coalition is prepared to support them.

Votel met with Iraqi military and political leaders in Baghdad and with Kurdish Peshmerga leaders in Irbil, in northern Iraq. He was ensuring US military advisory teams are with the right local units to provide the best support,intelligence gathering, surveillance and advice. Iraqi military leaders said Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has approved their combat plans. The fight will involvea broad spectrum of forces, including the Iraqi Army,counter-terrorism troops, police and a group of mainly Shiite,Iranian-backed militias. The fight will start “in the next few days,” Iraqi Brig.Gen. Yahia Rasool told reporters. Speaking through an interpreter, he said officials believe there are between 1,400 and 1,600 IS militants in the Tal Afar area. Many are foreign fighters, he said.

Rasool said the various Iraqi forces already have largely encircled Tal Afar. “I don’t think it will be tougher than the battle of Mosul, taking into consideration the experience we got in Mosul,” he said.

"Gorakhpur: In region deadly for children, dismal health parameters, poverty, poor infrastructure","A relative of a encephalitis patient near ward Number 100 billboard sitting outside the encephalitis ICU ward at BRD Medical University in Gorakhpur, UP. Express photo by Vishal Srivastav A relative of a encephalitis patient near ward Number 100 billboard sitting outside the encephalitis ICU ward at BRD Medical University in Gorakhpur, UP. Express photo by Vishal Srivastav

The death of over 150 children this month has firmly turned the focus on Gorakhpur’s BRD Hospital, but child deaths are common in this part of the country, beset by dismal health indicators, poverty, sub-optimal health infrastructure, both in the private and the public sectors, and decades of neglect. This is borne out in the National Family Health Survey 4 (2015–16), which for the first time tabulated district-level data (see boxes).

Sample this: Only 9.1 per cent of mothers in Gorakhpur had received full ante natal care, only 34.35 per cent households had “improved sanitation facility” largely interpreted to mean toilets and only 65.4 per cent children in the 12-23 months age group had been fully immunised (defined as BCG, measles and three doses each of polio and DPT).

Health experts list a number of reasons for these numbers in eastern Uttar Pradesh. “There is huge corruption, a kind of an extortionist feudal system. While there are large vacancies in the government sector, the private sector is filled with government doctors. It is a combination of illiteracy, poverty and social backwardness, a feudal structure and weak governance,” says former health secretary K Sujatha Rao.

The fact that so many children brought to BRD suffer from Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES), says Dr K S Reddy of the Public Health Foundation of India, shows that primary and secondary care are lacking. In ideal situations, AES treatment can be administered even at the primary health centre level. “Indicators of economic and social development are poor in eastern UP compared to other parts of the state, which have more agrarian prosperity, industrial growth, educational institutions and politically influential leaders. Eastern UP needs intensive investment in development and accelerated expansion of functioning health services,” says Dr Reddy.

"Bal Thackeray was a great communicator, says Arun Jaitley","Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Arun Jaitley. (Source: PTI) Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Arun Jaitley. (Source: PTI)

Union minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday described Bal Thackeray as a bold leader who often displayed the courage to swim against tide and time and connect with people.

Describing Thackeray as a versatile leader, the Union Minister for Finance and Defence, who was speaking at Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s book launch in Mumbai, said: “A charismatic leader, great cartoonist, writer and communicator, he would display boldness in voicing his concerns on national issues and cross border terrorism without mincing words.”

Jaitley added: “The media must have written more against Bal Thackeray than in his favour. Yet, he would convey his message to the masses across Maharashtra. Late Thackeray was a great communicator.”

He added: “Mahatma Gandhi had this ability to communicate with the people directly. The salt satyagraha was an example of how he held appeal across the masses.”

Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray asserted how his party was one of the oldest and loyal alliance partners of the BJP since the time they were treated as political untouchables. Today, when they are in power, everybody is making a beeline to embrace them, he said.

“Balasaheb (Thackeray) would have been happy to see Jaitley as the defense minister,” he said.

Uddhav highlighted the charismatic character of his father and said his confidence was supreme. It was late Thackeray’s Hindutva that laid the foundation for the ruling alliance at Centre and the state, he pointed out.

Recalling how the slogan “Garva Se Kaho Hum Hindu Hain” was given by Bal Thackeray and evoking the “sons of the soil” issue that was integral to Sena’s politics, he said: “Today, West Bengal talks of maa, mati, manush. In the 1960s, Bal Thackeray spoke of Marathi Manus. If the South can have wada-idli, why not vada pav in Maharashtra? If the Tamils can have Amma Canteen, why not the state boast of its Jhunka Bhakar,” Uddhav said.

Earlier, Raut had said: “Even today, it feels as if I am talking to Bal Thackeray daily and writing.”

This is a remarkable work of scholarship in a long-neglected area — state consolidation and frontier-making in the eastern Himalaya between 1910 and 1962. Unlike other books which have dealt with the high politics of the India-China relationship and boundary, it studies these issues from the ground up, from the point of view of the peoples and society. Coming when the Indian and Chinese states have accumulated hard power and are rubbing up against each other in their shared periphery, this history is a topical reminder of how we got to the present situation, and suggests alternate ways of looking at the processes of state formation and consolidation in the Indian and Chinese peripheries in the early 20th century.

The basic thesis is that existing analyses miss a fundamental element of Sino-Indian rivalry: the difficulty of coexisting in the Himalayas, a region whose distinct human landscape exposes India and China’s imperial nature. The 1962 war was preceded not just by military and diplomatic escalation, but by an older and increasingly tense shadowing contest to convince the eastern Himalayas’ inhabitants that one state, and not the other, was the better alternative. Guyot-Réchard sees India and China as post-imperial polities seeking to deepen their rule over the Himalayan region, where they encounter people starkly different from their “core” citizenry. She distinguishes between the behaviour of China and India. While China uses colonial policies on its geographic peripheries, independent India’s unity-in-diversity ideal coexisted with imperial strategies, and China and India see themselves as each other’s ‘shadow state’ in the Himalayas.

Based on research in the Arunachal Pradesh and Assam archives, original primary sources, and extensive interviews with those involved, the book naturally focuses much more closely on the Indian side, where sources are accessible. For the Chinese side, where sources are unavailable, limited or patchy, the author relies on deduction and inferred motives from revealed Chinese state behaviour. This could have opened her to the accusation that she is looking for keys lost somewhere else under a street lamp because that is where the light is. But the objectivity with which she handles the material avoids most pitfalls of this method — of picking over Indian flaws and hesitations while the official Chinese narrative gains undeserved credence by comparison and equation. It is hard to see what more she could have done. She has obeyed the historian’s cardinal rule and followed the evidence.

The result of her considerable scholarship is an important book that covers significant themes in an increasingly important area with a professional historian’s care and precision. For instance, the book deals with the complicated and non-linear transition in the eastern Himalaya from empire to nation-state in India and China, where the process was completed in the early 20th century (and, implicitly, in Tibet where the transition from a pre-modern polity to the nation state was not completed). It describes competitive state expansion in successive episodes, the first of which, by China in 1910-12, set off what Guyot-Réchard calls “shadow state” behaviour, where India and China reacted and mirrored what they thought the other was doing to consolidate power and sovereignty in this border region, and not only on their side of the Himalaya.

In describing this process, she is also alert to multiple side-shows which influenced the main flow of events in unpredictable ways. One was the triangular differences between London, Calcutta/Delhi and Assam. For London, imperial interests in keeping Russia out of Tibet dictated accommodation with China, recognition of Chinese “suzerainty” over Tibet, and ruled out an interest in expanding into the eastern Himalaya. New Delhi/Calcutta saw the exercise of British rule and recognition of boundaries as necessary both for security and commercial reasons but were unwilling to prioritise or invest. And, Assam saw Delhi’s regular relapse into a “policy of aloofness” as dangerous and sought a forward policy on the ground in terms of presence, civilian administration and development.

Another interesting theme was the impetus for the 1910 Treaty with Bhutan from Qing and Tibetan assertions of sovereignty in the eastern Himalaya, and Bhutan’s role in Calcutta and London’s Tibet and China policy. As for China, when she first tried to conquer Dzayul in May 1910 and entered the Lohit valley, the King of Bhutan was informed that his kingdom was China’s protectorate, and he was ordered to let Chinese currency circulate freely and to confine diplomatic relations to Beijing only — plus ça change…! This first burst of Qing China’s forward policy in the eastern Himalaya was soon ended by Tibetan resistance and the fall of the dynasty at home.

Shadow States: India, China and the Himalayas, 1910–1962

This is a book full of discovered delights, of repetitive patterns of behaviour by governments in India and China. One of them is the “recourse to force [which] had been a long-standing way of managing vulnerability on the part of China-based polities” that several instances in the book attest to. It is particularly good on the ebb and flow of administration in the eastern Himalayan borderland. Chapters 3 and 4 reveal the development dimension and the relationship between the people and the state in NEFA. The new Indian state differed from its predecessor, but carried on its legacy. With the 1950 Assam earthquake, independent India changed the coercive state vocabulary by adding development initiatives and relief. The story of state-building is told clinically and well.

The real value of this book is its emphasis on the role of the people of the eastern Himalaya and what it says of “ever-changing state-society relations on either side of the eastern Himalayas”. It describes local peoples’ preference for the looser arrangements of India over the monopolistic Chinese approach to their polities and societies. It was this preference that saw the relatively smooth return of the Indian administration into these areas after the 1962 war, despite Chinese attempts during their two to three month occupation of large parts of NEFA to demonstrate their goodwill to the people and to prove their superiority over the Indian state. Guyot-Réchard argues that “arguably, the PRC’s demonstration of invincibility, impeccable efficiency and self-sufficiency had been too convincing.”

The book also brings a fresh perspective to China’s military victory in 1962, which Guyot-Réchard says could well turn out to be Pyrrhic. She argues that viewed solely in military terms or of control of territory, the victory was undeniably China’s. But why then, as John W. Garver points out, is this China’s “forgotten war”? Is it because China’s leaders felt they miscalculated in launching it, and that it failed to resolve China’s coexistence with India or win over the populations of the eastern Himalaya? After the war, Tibetan resistance to Chinese rule continued, and NEFA’s people cooperated with returning Indian authorities. To that extent, the narrative of Chinese victory loses its shine, she points out. My own sense is that the war was at least as much an internal political coup by Mao, which succeeded, but which can hardly be acknowledged. It is probably a combination of several of these factors that explains the Chinese treatment of 1962 as the ‘forgotten war’.

As China seeks to extend her strategic frontiers in several directions including the eastern Himalaya, and India seeks to maintain the natural geographic boundaries that have served her through history, this is a timely and useful book. It is also a useful reminder of the relatively recent and fragile nature of state formation in the eastern Himalaya. Internal party-political games in the Northeast, toppling governments and stretching the law beyond its capacity, and failure to meet minimum standards of governance only lays in store trouble in a situation of weak and fragile state structures and fundamental social change in our Himalayan borderland. When China is increasingly active at our periphery, when she hosts insurgent leaders from the Northeast India like Paresh Baruah, and reactivates Indian insurgent groups, it is useful to remember that this has been an arena of India-China competition for over a century, where the two countries have shadowed each other, where new states and aggressive nationalisms are yet to find equipoise, and where development has proved its worth as an instrument in the past.

We need more work like this which takes us away from the monochromatic state and sovereignty-centred view of our borders to a fuller understanding of our own past that includes the agency of the people and that show us the complexity of what we have inherited. In that complexity itself lies opportunity for the pragmatic policymaker, for the historian and for those who are prisoners of our present constricted narrative on China, our borders and the history we share. Like a true work of history, it will have served a useful purpose if it brings us to question conventional wisdom, widens our vision, and provokes more scholarship on its themes, and on the domestic and internal political dynamics that drive India and China to do what they do. Do read this book. It is of value well beyond the limited circle of academic readers that the title might attract.

"Sushil Modi fires fresh salvo against Lalu Prasad, his family","Sushil Kumar Modi File/ PTI Photo Sushil Kumar Modi File/ PTI Photo

Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Sunday came out with a fresh allegation against Lalu Prasad and his family saying that the RJD chief’s wife had acquired land worth over Rs 2 crore in lieu of which favours were allegedly granted. The senior BJP leader alleged that one Ramashray Prasad Yadav was made chairman of Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) besides one Mohammad Shamim was nominated as an MLC from the governor’s quota when the RJD was in power.

Ramashray Prasad Yadav was the chairman of BPSC from January 1991 to January 1997 when Prasad was the chief minister while Mohammad Shamim was nominated as MLC from the governor’s quota in 1998 when Rabri Devi was the chief minister, Sushil Modi told a press conference in Patna. The deputy chief minister was flanked by the state BJP vice president Devesh Kumar, party chief whip and MLA Arun Kumar Sinha and Nitin Navin, also an MLA.

The deputy chief minister alleged that Ramashray Prasad Yadav, first of all, registered a plot of land measuring 6726 sq ft, around 6 cottah, at Saguna Mor area in Patna worth over Rupees 2 crore to one Mohammad Shamim and his wife Sofia Tabbasum in 1993-94. On May 13, 2005, Shamim and his wife Tabbasum gave the “power of attorney” to Rabri Devi who in her election affidavit showed the property as her own asset, Sushil Modi said. He asked as to why did Rabri Devi mention in her affidavit that it was her asset when she was just given power of attorney of the said property?

“We have come across the various innovative ways and means of acquiring properties by Lalu Prasad…So far we have seen that Prasad and his family have been acquiring properties through shell companies, gifts, direct registry of land but now he has devised a new and innovative way of acquiring land through ‘power of attorney’,” Sushil Modi said.

Taking a jibe at Lalu Prasad, the senior BJP leader said that he (Lalu) must be rewarded for coming out with new and innovative ideas of acquiring land, the ideas which even agencies like Income Tax cannot think of. Sushil Modi wondered as how can Rabri Devi, a former chief minister, be made the caretaker of the land of one Mohammad Shamim as it is the otherway round that people normally become caretakers of the property of former CMs.

Meanwhile, the RJD chief dodged a query about Sushil Modi’s allegations at a press conference in Patna. Prasad, however, said that all the documents about his property are in public domain. RJD Bihar unit spokesman and MLA Shakti Singh Yadav said that “Sushil Modi’s allegations vis-a-vis Lalu Prasad’s family is concocted. He has not said anything new as everything is in the public domain.”

The spokesman said that “We have been demanding independent probe into the charges levelled by RJD against Sushil Modi’s relatives- Mahavir Modi and R K Modi- who have acquired benami properties through shell companies. The Centre should conduct investigation.”

"West Bromwich Albion have rejected bid for defender Jonny Evans, says Tony Pulis","Tony Pulis confirmed that the club have rejected a bid for defender Jonny Evans from Manchester City. (Source: File) Tony Pulis confirmed that the club have rejected a bid for defender Jonny Evans from Manchester City. (Source: File)

West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis confirmed that the club have rejected a bid for defender Jonny Evans from Premier League rivals Manchester City, but stopped short of completely ruling out a move away from the Hawthorns for the centre-back.

Pulis told a news conference ahead of Saturday’s Premier League trip to Burnley that Evans, who is out with a hamstring injury, would not be sold unless an “enormous” offer was made.

“We’ve turned down an offer for Jonny,” Pulis said on Friday. “Every player is for sale at the right price. “It is absolutely crazy to say a team like West Brom won’t sell players if people weren’t going to put an enormous amount of money in front of you.

“Firstly, we don’t want to sell him, we don’t need to sell him. So we’re not desperate to get the money. It would have to be a very, very good offer.”

Pulis also dismissed reports that Tottenham Hotspur defender Kevin Wimmer was close to completing a switch to West Brom. “Whoever’s telling you we are close is miles away from that fact. We have a lot of irons in the fire with a lot of targets,” Pulis said.

West Brom centre-back Gareth McAuley and midfielder James Morrison are also ruled out of the trip to Burnley as they are recovering from thigh and knee injuries, respectively.

Aaron Mooy strikes as buoyant Huddersfield edge Newcastle,"Aaron Mooy scored for Huddersfield in the 50th minute. (Source: Reuters) Aaron Mooy scored for Huddersfield in the 50th minute. (Source: Reuters)

Promoted Huddersfield Town made it two wins out of two in the Premier League as a superb Aaron Mooy strike gave them a 1-0 home win over Newcastle United on Sunday.

The hosts built on last week’s 3-0 win over Crystal Palace, which marked their return to the top flight after a 45-year absence, when Australian Mooy grabbed the winner in the 50th minute.

Newcastle, who also won promotion from the Championship last season, should have equalised in the 68th minute but Ayoze Perez wasted a chance from close range.

Rafa Benitez’s Newcastle remain without a point following their home loss to Tottenham Hotspur last week.

There was a buzz of anticipation around the John Smith’s Stadium as Huddersfield, three times champions in the 1920’s, prepared to welcome England’s elite once more.

German manager David Wagner, whose team won promotion through the playoffs, has energised the Yorkshire town, injecting optimism and excitement into a club that had been struggling in the second tier Championship when he took over in November, 2015.

Signs of ‘We are Premier League’ were proudly displayed outside the ground and former players, such as ex-England international Frank Worthington, savoured the occasion in the stands.

A series of new signings, mainly from Europe, during the off-season has given Huddersfield a fighting chance of survival and their opening-day win at Palace only added to the optimism of the Terriers faithful.

Not surprisingly in such an atmosphere, Huddersfield attacked from the outset but there were few clear chances and a Tom Ince snap-shot in the 13th minute was their first real effort on goal.

A minute later, Newcastle threatened with their Scottish international winger Matt Ritchie forcing a fine diving save out of home keeper Jonas Lossl.

Huddersfield took the lead in outstanding fashion five minutes after the break with Australian midfielder Mooy playing a neat one-two with Elias Kachunga and then curling a fine shot past the helpless Rob Elliot.

Benitez took off the ineffective Dwight Gayle, replacing him with Spanish forward Joselu, and that, combined with greater urgency, saw Newcastle apply some pressure.

Perez should have brought Newcastle level in the 68th minute when he fired over the bar from five metres out and although Newcastle battled hard at the end, they lacked craft and ingenuity.

A massive roar greeted the final whistle from the home fans who know that every point is likely to matter if they are to remain in the Premier League at the end of the season.

Out of my mind: Modi’s new BJP,"Modi’s advantage is exactly that people underestimate him as a thinking person. Exprees Photo By Amit Mehra 15 August 2017 Modi’s advantage is exactly that people underestimate him as a thinking person. Exprees Photo By Amit Mehra 15 August 2017

Sometimes it is the nearness which obscures the vision. Even three years after Narendra Modi piloted the BJP to a single-party majority, the Opposition fails to see the nature of the ideological transformation he has wrought in the party. His Independence Day speech elicited the usual responses — ‘Communalism’, ‘Intolerance’, ‘Muslims in danger’, ‘Hindu nationalism’. Modi may talk of ‘Desh jodo’ and 125 crore people. He may talk about women’s rights or removing poverty, but everyone on the other side hears a sinister plan to abolish diversity.

Modi’s advantage is exactly that people underestimate him as a thinking person. On the Left, there is a universal belief that the Rightists are stupid and bigoted. I know because the Labour Party made the mistake for many years when Mrs Thatcher was winning election after election. After the fourth defeat, we sobered up and began to learn from the message that Mrs Thatcher had sold to the people.

In Modi’s case, few are willing to see firstly how far the RSS has come since M S Golwalkar’s time. Remember when Mohan Bhagwat argued for equality among all, everyone attacked him as being anti-reservation. ‘The RSS and equality?’. Nor do they see the way in which Modi has expanded the political space for the BJP. Modi has fashioned a new BJP ideology without abandoning its core. Hindu nationalism was never enough to win a majority. Atal Bihari Vajpayee reached the limit of that. It is Modi who has forced the BJP/RSS to become inclusive.

Two examples. Modi has systematically expanded the BJP reach into Dalit votes. It would have been hard for the hardline BJP to contemplate this. He has done it by taking over Ambedkar as a figure to be honoured. The hatred for Ambedkar among orthodox Congress Hindus, to say nothing of Jan Sanghis, has been forgotten. But Modi’s inclusive strategy is not clientelist like the Congress had. By establishing enabling institutions to help Dalit entrepreneurs, he is appealing to the aspirations of Dalits.

Modi’s other innovation is to focus strongly on women’s issues, from LPG gas cylinder to the crusade against outdoor defecation. No one until he came along associated outdoor defecation with gender issues. Indeed, through years of socialism, such trivial considerations were beneath attention.

The gender issue also fans out into triple talaq. Who can forget that to prevent Shah Bano from getting alimony, Parliament, with an overwhelming Congress majority, passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act. The Act was against the rights of Muslim women on divorce. The Supreme Court in awarding the victory to Shah Bano had suggested that Parliament could bring in Uniform Civil Code (UCC). This was the stage at which UCC became anti-secular, though it had been a demand of the All-India Women’s Conference since the 1930s.

The BJP stepped up its campaign on UCC once the Congress retreated. Now Modi has made it not a secular/ communal issue but a gender equality issue. Of course his detractors would say that being a Rightist, he cannot be sincere. That it is just a device for being anti-Muslim. But Muslim women have just the same rights as other women even if the BJP delivers them.

This is the challenge the Opposition faces. Given Modi’s luck, they will fail to meet it.

"Bangladesh cricket is not all about Mominul Haque, says coach Chandika Hathurusinghe","Mominul Haque has been dropped from Bangladesh squad. (Source: Reuters) Mominul Haque has been dropped from Bangladesh squad. (Source: Reuters)

Mominul Haque and Mahmudullah failed to find a place in the Bangladesh squad that will face Australia in two-match Test series which is scheduled to start from August 27. Haque has been dropped for the first time since making his Test debut in 2013 and coach Chandika Hathurusinghe said that the selection has been pretty fair and all the players know what they need to do.

“As a coach, you have a responsibility,” Hathurusinghe said. “But the player also knows what he has to do. They are working very hard on it. “Somebody is going to go out of the team when they are not performing. Those players not in the squad, they are still practicing. Confidence comes when we communicate with the player. There is no rule but fairness is applied for everybody,” he added.

Talking about Mominul’s selection, the coach insisted that the players need to be more consistent to sustain their place in the team.

“Bangladesh cricket is not all about Mominul,” he said. “Selection is done by consistency. Some of the guys were dropped for our last Test. I won’t mention name because the team is more important.”

Moreover, he went on to say that the consistency in selection process gives confidence to players as well. “Consistent selection gives a lot of confidence to players who perform. We have reason to make good calls because we have been consistent on selection,” he added.

In a historic first for international football, seven women officials have been picked as support referees for the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in India, which kicks off on October 6.

“…for the first-ever time, FIFA has selected female referees for a men’s tournament. The results and improvements seen in the joint preparations have shown that the time has come for the elite female referees to officiate in men’s competitions together with their male colleagues,” the event’s organising committee said in a statement.

The FIFA Referees Committee has appointed 21 trios of match officials, representing all six confederations.

“For FIFA, it is essential to ensure that the best match officials from all around the world are selected for FIFA competitions,” the organising committee stated.

For some of the selected match officials, the event will be an important step in their preparations for FIFA’s flagship competition, the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

“We think it’s time for the elite female referees to be involved in a FIFA men’s competition. They worked together with male match officials last year and now we want to see them working together in a competition,” said FIFA Head of Refereeing Massimo Busacca.

The referees have completed a host of activities together in several seminars, including theoretical sessions in the classroom and practical sessions on the field of play.

The match officials have also discussed and practiced various game situations to achieve consistency and uniformity.

The under-17 World Cup will take place in Goa, Guwahati, Kochi, Kolkata, Navi Mumbai and New Delhi between October 6 and 28.

The final will be played at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan Stadium in Kolkata on October 28.

A 16-year-old boy in the US has died after falling about 45-feet while volunteering on a construction project inside a Hindu temple in New Jersey, police said. The boy from Hatfield, Pennsylvania, was volunteering on a construction project at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir campus on Thursday in Robbinsville when he fell, Robbinsville police spokesman Lt Michael Polaski said.

The teen was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital at Hamilton, where he died an hour later, NBC Philadelphia reported. “The victim fell about 45-feet and the fall appears to be an accident, but it is still under investigation,” Polaski said. Police have not released the identity of the victim.

Vinay Limbachia, a volunteer at the temple, said people at the temple were looking into what exactly the boy was helping with. The temple is inside a larger structure. The boy’s fall occurred inside the structure, but in an area next to the temple.

The boy and his family usually worshipped at the faith’s temple in Lansdale, Limbachia said. A second temple remains under construction on the campus.

A spokesperson said the worship site has been built completely by volunteers. The BAPS called the incident as a “tragic accident” and promised to work with Robbinsville Police. “The entire BAPS family is heartbroken by the tragic accident that took the life of one of our young volunteers,” the organisation said in a statement.

“The prayers, condolences, and support of every BAPS family are with the family of this talented young man, whose loss will be felt by all those fortunate to have known him,” they said. The temple with its intricate marble carvings and Indian design was dedicated in August 2014 and draws thousands of worshipers from around the world.

Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) is a volunteer-driven religious and charitable organisation founded in the early 20th century and named after Swaminarayan, a religious leader of the late 1700s and early 1800s.

It has major worship centres in Mumbai, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, London, Los Angeles, Nairobi, Sydney, and Toronto.

Boko Haram ramps up attacks on refugee camps in northeast Nigeria: Aid agency,"FILE PHOTO: In this Wednesday April 8, 2015, Nigerian soldiers man a checkpoint in Gwoza, Nigeria.

Boko Haram militants are ramping up attacks on sites sheltering people uprooted by the jihadists’ insurgency in northeast Nigeria – pushing the displaced from “one hell into another” – a leading aid agency said on Friday. The Islamists are seeking softer targets – such as camps hosting the displaced – as Nigeria’s military offensive against the group intensifies, said the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).

Suicide bombers have killed and wounded dozens of people in recent months in a spate of attacks on camps and areas sheltering the displaced that bore the hallmarks of Boko Haram. Civilians were caught up in violence on about 200 occasions last month – triple the total for June – and there have been at least 32 attacks on camps and sites for those uprooted by the conflict since July, according to latest data from the NRC.

“Camps sheltering innocent families fleeing war should be places of refuge,” said Ernest Mutanga, head of programmes for NRC in Nigeria. “But instead they are turning into death traps. “Armed groups in this conflict are pushing people from one hell into another,” he said in a statement.

Boko Haram’s brutal eight-year campaign to carve out an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria has killed about 20,000 people and forced more than 2.7 million to flee their homes. Nigeria’s military last year wrested back large swathes of territory from the Islamist insurgents. But the militants have struck back with renewed zeal since June, killing at least 170 people and weakening the army’s control in the northeast.

The spike in violence is hindering aid work in the region, with agencies such as the NRC having been forced to temporarily suspend their operations in Maidiguri – the capital of Borno state – due to threats from Boko Haram. “We are worried that if these attacks continue, a very bad situation will grow even worse when it comes to aid access and delivery,” Jackie Okao, protection and advocacy adviser at the NRC in Nigeria, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

About 5.2 million people are expected to need food aid by the end of this month – an increase of 500,000 from the start of 2017 – in a region threatened with famine, according to the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP). Yet the situation could be far worse with many areas cut off from help due to the threat of Boko Haram and the arrival of the rainy season restricting access, aid agencies say.

The Philippines government says a child missing after a vehicle plowed into pedestrians in Barcelona is the 7-year-old son of a Filipino woman who had been living in Australia.

The Philippines’ Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs Sarah Arriola said in a statement on Saturday that the 43-year-old Filipino woman was seriously injured in Thursday’s attack. She had been based in Australia for the past three or four years.

Arriola says the woman and her son were in Barcelona to attend the wedding of a cousin from the Philippines.

Arriola says the woman’s British husband is en route to Barcelona to help find his son. Arriola says the boy was separated from his mother during the attack.

Australia’s prime minister has urged people to pray for the child.

(Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh) India take on South Africa for four Tests, five ODIs and two Twenty20 series. (Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh)

The likelihood of India playing South Africa in the Boxing Day Test or even on New Year’s looks increasingly bleak due to a packed schedule for the top-ranked India. The Test, originally scheduled to be played at Newlands, looks to be in jeopardy as India won’t reach South Africa and be comfortable with the conditions by then. This would severely hamper the Boxing Day Test which has been the highlight of South Africa’s domestic calendar with Cape Town hosting the second Test from January 2.

But considering Sri Lanka’s tour of India would run till December 24, the chances of India playing anywhere before first week of January looks difficult. As per reports, India will land in South Africa in last week of December to play the four Tests, five ODIs and two T20Is series. They would want to acclimatise with the conditions for at least a week.

“We can’t make it make it in time. The Sri Lanka tour ends on December 24. After that we need to give the boys a few days’ rest,” a board official told ESPNcricinfo. “The South Africa tour is a big one, so they need to play two warm-up games, so it will take at least 10 days [before the first Test].”

In India’s absence, Cricket South Africa are looking at options to stage a one-off Test. Pakistan and Afghanistan are reportedly the two possible options to travel to South Africa but nothing concrete has been set yet.

“I had been aware of the fact that they were unlikely to be there for Boxing Day, but for them not to be here for the New Year’s Day is a major blow to CSA and the fans,” said Tony Irish, head of South African players association. “To lose Boxing Day is a big thing, but to lose both of them would be massive hit for the fans.”

Irish felt India could play a two or three day game ahead of the opening Test to ensure the contest in early January goes ahead but BCCI official said the players could not be pushed.

“If the India Test matches start much after January 2 or 3, there will be a lot of concern about the players’ workload,” Irish said. “You really compound the workload issue.” Irish has raised this concern with CSA. As per the current calendar, as soon as India leave, Australia play a four Test series in South Africa before the players head to India for the IPL. If South Africa do find an alternative for the Boxing Day, they would be playing nine Tests inside two months.

"Robin Singh, Balwant Singh goals give India edgy win over Mauritius","India beat Mauritius 2-1 in a friendly on Saturday. (Source: File) India beat Mauritius 2-1 in a friendly on Saturday. (Source: File)

India did find their equaliser before the break, somehow, against a Mauritius team that was the better side for the first 45 minutes. It took a close range strike from Robin Singh, who scored for the first time since November 2015, to restore parity after Jean Jocelyn had given the visitors the lead at the Andheri Sports Complex.

Coach Stephen Constantine had fielded a relatively experienced starting XI for the friendly, but the winner would eventually come from Balwant Singh, who has played for the national team just once before — that too for only five minutes. Balwant entered the game as a half-time substitute, replacing Robin at a time when the movement in the attacking third by the hosts was static, and posed little threat to the opposition defenders.

After Balwant’s introduction, the Mauritius’ midfield was pushed back to counter the pressure the Blue Tigers were building up. Balwant’s movement freed up his teammates, particularly strike-partner Jeje Lalpekhlua, who had been closely watched by defenders.

In the 62nd minute, the pair combined to score the winner. Receiving a grounded pass by Eugeneson Lyngdoh deep in his own half, Jeje cleverly flicked the ball to his right to find an unmarked Balwant. The forward, who became the first ever Indian to score in the Indian Super League back in 2014 (months after his five-minute international debut against Bangladesh) latched onto the pass, took a few quick strides into the box, and powerfully drove his shot which goalkeeper Kevin Jean-Louis only managed to get a weak touch on.

“Balwant was superb today, he absolutely ran himself to the ground,” says Constantine. “I’m glad he got his first goal.” Over the 90 minutes, Constantine awarded three more debuts – Amrinder Singh, Nikhil Poojary and Manvir Singh. The latter had a chance to increase the gap, but his long-range effort soared just over the crossbar.

Despite India getting its ninth consecutive win, Constantine wasn’t too pleased with his team’s performance. Mauritius’ opening goal, in the 15th minute, came after their striker was left unmarked inside the box.

How a new directive by Sebi looks set to change the rules of the borrowing game,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). (File Photo) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). (File Photo)

Four years ago, minutes after taking over as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan made the now famous statement about promoters not having a divine right to stay in charge if they could not manage an enterprise. For many promoters, life has been difficult not just because of a business downturn, but also because rules of the game have changed considerably over the last couple of years. The new insolvency law that came into effect this year has seen a dozen-odd corporates being referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) which will ensure either a quick turnaround, or closure.

The nature of the relationship between lender and borrower or debtor and creditor, especially where big business groups are involved, has long been skewed in favour of the borrower. This situation now looks set to change.

Earlier this month, the securities market regulator, Sebi, unveiled a new rule under which listed firms will have to publicly disclose, within one working day, any default on a bond or loan that it commits, either in local or international markets, or on any other securities. Such defaults were hitherto not made public — banks cited confidentiality agreements entered into with borrowers as the reason — and credit rating agencies, therefore, often fell behind the curve.

The new rule, which comes into effect from October, will potentially trigger behavioural changes among banks, firms and investors.

India’s bankers have been used to even some of the better names stretching the concept of working capital liquidity by making interest payments, in many cases, up to 89 days after the due date — just in time to ensure that the loan does not turn ‘bad’ (mandatory when interest or instalment on the principal remains unpaid for 90 days or longer). Often, fresh funds are lent to group firms to prevent a loan from being classified as a bad loan — a practice that is known as “evergreening”.

Such quiet arrangements between banks and borrowers could be put to test in the new regime — unless lenders, especially among the private banks, design new ways to escape the regulator’s gaze and game the system. The new rule should impose a higher degree of credit discipline on both the borrower and the bank to prevent an early default. This is because a public disclosure of even a small default can impact not just the company’s stock, but also its ability to raise capital in the future. It will mean a downgrade by credit rating agencies, with implications for the cost of borrowing.

For banks, it should indicate a much closer monitoring of loans or credit. For investors, the rule change will provide an early opportunity to assess the risks of staying on, and help them cut losses rather than holding on to a lemon without any way to recover their funds.

The rule change should also make it more difficult for promoters or businessmen to nudge bankers to go easy on repayments. The real test of this new preventive measure to stem the build-up of bad loans already aggregating Rs 8 lakh crore will come after October. In the current business cycle, with many firms struggling, the frequency of downgrades with each public disclosure of a default should logically be higher. That is something the regulators should be looking at closely.

It seems apparent that the top financial regulators are working to ensure that listed banks have to now disclose publicly the reason for the divergence of over 15% in the numbers furnished by them and the one reached by the banking regulator after inspection. Three private banks, including two leading ones, have figured in such a list. It casts doubts on the integrity of accounts, the role of audit committees, and the boards of the banks, and leaves investors with the apprehension of more bad news. Elsewhere, when the integrity of financial accounts is violated, punishments are swift. Indian regulators haven’t come down as hard on such practices as their global peers. The P J Nayak Committee, which reviewed the governance of bank boards, suggested a way forward: levying of penalties through cancellation of unvested stock options, clamping down on monetary bonuses for the top management and full-time directors, and directing the chairman of the audit committee to step down from the board of the bank.

As the global experience shows, cleaning up banks can be a prolonged and painful affair. It will be a test of political resolve — especially because not enough jobs are being created and existing jobs are being threatened with more companies being referred to the insolvency forum — besides governance, integrity and regulatory capacity. During the last such cycle over 15 years ago, when too, an NDA government was in power, the pedal was eased as soon as the recovery started. For years after that, the can was kicked further down the road. Doing that again may be difficult.

Iran reform leader Mehdi Karroubi ends hunger strike,"Iranian opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi, under house arrest for six years, ended his hunger strike after the government agreed to remove intelligence agents from his home. However, his demand to face trial — he has never been charged since being placed under house arrest in 2011 –appears no closer to being granted.

Karroubi, 79, stopped eating and drinking on Wednesday morning and was hospitalised a day later with high blood pressure. His son, Mohammad Hossein, told the reformist Jamaran website that Karroubi had met with Health Minister Ghazizadeh Hashemi yesterday, and secured promises that convinced him to end the hunger strike.

Sahamnews, a website linked to the Karroubi family, said the minister had promised to remove the agents from his home. Karroubi and fellow reformist leader Mir Hossein Mousavi were candidates in Iran’s disputed 2009 presidential election which sparked months of mass protests over claims that the polls were rigged in favour of hardline incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Both were placed under house arrest in 2011 for their role in the protests, which were brutally put down by the regime. Karroubi’s wife Fatemeh told Sahamnews earlier this week that his first demand was the removal of intelligence ministry agents and security cameras that had been recently installed inside their home, which she said “has no precedent before or after the (1979 Islamic) revolution in any house arrest”.

“Second… in case of continuation of the house arrest, they should arrange a public trial,” she said. Karroubi “does not expect a fair trial” but wants it to be public and would respect the verdict, she added.

In March, Iran sentenced Karroubi’s eldest son Hossein to six months in prison for “propaganda against the regime” after he published a letter that his father had written to Iran’s current president, Hassan Rouhani, considered a political moderate, calling for a trial.

Karroubi’s failing health — he underwent a heart operation earlier this month — poses a potential problem for the Iranian regime, with fears that it could provide a lightning rod for renewed protests.

Rouhani won a resounding re-election victory in May, in part by rallying reformists and vowing to win the release of Mousavi and Karroubi. But hardline judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadegh Larijani threw cold water over Rouhani’s promises shortly after the election. “Who are you to end the house arrest?” Larijani said in May.

Great Britain hoping for record medal haul at Winter Games,"Lizzy Yarnold won gold in the skeleton, and is hoping to become the first British Winter Olympics athlete to defend a title. (Source: Reuters) Lizzy Yarnold won gold in the skeleton, and is hoping to become the first British Winter Olympics athlete to defend a title. (Source: Reuters)

British athletes are hoping for their best-ever Winter Olympics medal haul in Pyeongchang next February after matching their previous record of four last time around in Sochi.

Team GB Chef de Mission Mike Hay told reporters at a media event in Edinburgh that a medal target was unlikely to be set in stone before December or early January but the signs were promising.

“I have to say that I’m pretty excited about the talent that we do have in our team, across a number of sports and disciplines,” he said.

Britain was second in the overall medal table at last year’s Rio de Janeiro summer Olympics, with 27 gold medals and 67 in total.

It has been a different story on snow and ice, with Jenny Jones’s bronze medal in snowboard slopestyle at the 2014 Games in Russia representing the country’s first Olympic success on snow.

Lizzy Yarnold won gold in the skeleton, and is hoping to become the first British Winter Olympics athlete to defend a title, while the men’s and women’s curling teams won silver and bronze respectively.

British Ski and Snowboard performance director Dan Hunt said last month that the country could win as many as seven medals on snow this time around.

Standout results from last season included Dave Ryding’s second place in the Kitzbuehel Alpine skiing World Cup slalom in January.

Short track speedskater Elise Christie won three golds at the world championships in Rotterdam last March, after being disqualified from her three events in Sochi, and holds the 500m world record.

Britain’s previous best medal haul before Sochi was at the 1924 Chamonix Games in France, when only 16 nations competed compared to 88 in 2014.

Team GB expect to take around 60 athletes to Pyeongchang, compared to their previous biggest squad of 56 in Sochi, with 10 curlers already selected.

“UK Sport have confidence in the winter sports being able to produce,” said Hay, while warning that the top talent was spread thinly and always vulnerable to injury in sports that are more dangerous than many on the summer schedule.

“For them to get to the Games healthy is key for us,” he added.

Aerial skier Lloyd Wallace, a 2015 junior world championships bronze medallist, became one such casualty this week when he suffered a serious head injury in training in Switzerland.

British Ski and Snowboard said on Saturday that Wallace was now “conscious and comfortable” and would be moved from intensive care to a recovery ward in Zurich. “He is doing well and is able to talk,” it said in a statement.

Stuart Broad surpasses ‘hero’ Ian Botham,"Stuart Broad (R) surpassed Ian Botham as England’s second highest wicket taker. (Source: Instagram) Stuart Broad (R) surpassed Ian Botham as England’s second highest wicket taker. (Source: Instagram)

Stuart Broad remained overjoyed after surpassing his ‘hero’ Ian Botham to become England’s second highest wicket taker following England’s mauling of West Indies in the day-night Test at Edgbaston which the hosts won by an innings and 209 runs. Broad finished with five wickets in the match – two wickets in the first innings and three in the second – to go above Botham’s tally of 383 wickets for England.

By castling Shane Dowrich, Broad picked up his milestone 384th wicket to become England’s second highest wicket taker. In the process, he also gave England a massive win in their first day-night Test.

“He’s obviously been a hero of mine, someone who gave me my Test cap back in 2007 and someone who inspired me to play cricket for England with his performances. It’s very special to be up there in the ranks with him,” said Broad on Botham.

In fact, it was Botham who handed Broad his Test cap in Colombo in December 2007 and the former all-rounder was present at the ground when Broad reached the milestone moment.

What a way to do it – @StuartBroad8 takes his 384th Test wicket to become our second highest wicket taker! 👏http://t.co/rxDAQ3Mugf pic.twitter.com/72OvnVstqh — England Cricket (@englandcricket) 19 August 2017

“It was great, I’m very pleased for him, I think it’s terrific,” said Botham in response. And later added, “Many congratulations ‘Broady’ great effort really pleased for you !!!! Better have a good glass or two of the finest !!!!” in a tweet.

Broad revelled in the momentous occasion. “They add up pretty quickly. There’s been some great memories along the way, certainly. You don’t really remember the wickets you take, you remember the Test matches you win and those special moments winning series.”

“It’s a very special day, having the family here and being able to take a special wicket but it’s the Test series wins that you remember.”

Only James Anderson stands ahead of Broad in the list of highest wicket takers with 492 wickets to his name.

Men find sexual assault as traumatising as women do: Research,"These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research. (Source: File Photo) These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research. (Source: File Photo)

Men are often looked at only as perpetrators of sexual assaults. But what happens to those men who become victims of such assaults? These men feel just as emotionally traumatised and depressed as women do, reveals new research.

Sexual assault is unwanted sexual contact — including rape — and is a traumatising event linked to numerous mental health consequences associated with negative outcomes such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, fear, anxiety, alcohol dependence, use of illicit substances, suicidal ideation, and attempted suicide. While there is extensive research on the collateral consequences experienced by females, almost no research exists on how sexual violence affects adult, non-incarcerated males or how it affects them as compared to females.

The new findings, published in the journal Women & Criminal Justice, challenge a sociological theory that explains that men are more likely to respond to sexual assault with anger and by engaging in criminal activity, while women are more likely to respond with depression and sadness.

“When we began this study, we thought for sure that we would find that females who were sexually assaulted would exhibit higher depression scores than males who were sexually assaulted,” said lead researcher Lisa Dario, Assistant Professor at Florida Atlantic University in the US.

“I think this is probably because of antiquated ideas that men and women experience emotions differently. What we actually discovered, much to our surprise, is that sexual assault is traumatic regardless of gender,” Dario added. The study involved a sample size of 11,860 adults in the US — 5,922 men and 5,938 women — obtained from the National Violence Against Women Survey’s database.

The researchers found that all victims of sexual assault had higher depression scores than individuals who have had not experienced sexual assault in their lifetime.

Men make up about 38 percent of sexual assault and rape incidents reported, and those in the military are particularly vulnerable and more unlikely to report an assault, according to the US National Crime Victimisation Survey results. The researchers suspect that it is possible that men may even experience depression more than women because they do not have the social outlets and support systems available to women, and therefore may wind up internalising their feelings and emotions.

“There is no room for ‘sexism’ in sexual assault research [by ignoring male victims] and we must bring attention to an issue that impacts men equally, especially if we know that their negative emotional responses are treatable,” Dario said.

Jobs for daily wagers completing 7 years: PU panel to place proposal before syndicate meeting today,"“Right now, around 1,500 daily wage workers are working out of which around 450 workers are eligible for the proposed regularisation. So, we have to see if the syndicate gives final nod to the proposal or not,” said Deeepak Kaushik, president of PU non-teaching union. “Right now, around 1,500 daily wage workers are working out of which around 450 workers are eligible for the proposed regularisation. So, we have to see if the syndicate gives final nod to the proposal or not,” said Deeepak Kaushik, president of PU non-teaching union.

MEMBERS OF the subcommittee of the Joint Consultative Committee (JCC) of Panjab University, constituted to frame the policy to regularise the services of daily wage employees on the lines of the state government, have proposed to regularise daily wage employees, who have completed seven years of service.

The proposal, which would be placed before the next syndicate meeting scheduled for August 20, recommends that daily wage employees, who have completed seven years of service up to March 31, 2016, and other conditions of the previous regularisation policy should be regularised if they are fulfilling all the conditions of qualification work and conduct report.

“Right now, around 1,500 daily wage workers are working out of which around 450 workers are eligible for the proposed regularisation. So, we have to see if the syndicate gives final nod to the proposal or not,” said Deeepak Kaushik, president of PU non-teaching union. The proposal also includes minutes of the JCC meeting held on January 29, 2016.

At that meeting, Dr Gurdip Kumar Sharma, the chairman of the committee, mentioned how for years, the university was hiring daily wagers for seasonal work and no regular appointments were made. The route for regularising clerks or any other daily wager employed for seasonal work at the varsity and subsequently granting them extension and fill the vacant posts of regular substantive posts for which no efforts were made to fill by proper advertisement and selection process.

The meeting also discussed that there was no proper procedure for walk-in interviews like approval of qualifications, selection criteria, etc. It was also mentioned that the time period for seasonal work is only 89 days though many daily wagers have continued working despite the end of their seasonal work. It was also highlighted that there are 20-30 departments where surplus manpower provided on daily wage basis than the sanctioned posts. The issue of conducting manpower audit at PU was also discussed.

PGI to replace present oxygen storage tank with new one,"The oxygen gas plant at PGI. (Express Photo by Jasbir Malhi) The oxygen gas plant at PGI. (Express Photo by Jasbir Malhi)

THE POST Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) will soon replace its existing 7kl (7000 litres) oxygen storage tank with a new 12kl (12,000 litres) tank. PGI officials said the new tank would enhance the oxygen storage capacity of north India’s premier medical hub. Currently, four oxygen tanks are there at PGI, including two at Advance Pediatrics Centre (APC) and Advance Cardiac Centre (ACC) which are 10 kl each. Two additional plants, having a storage capacity of 12 kl and 7 kl, respectively, also supply oxygen to the hospital.

“The process has already started and we are expecting to replace the existing 7Kl tank with a newer one soon,” said an official, adding that in the newly set up tanks at ACC and APC, a facility has also been added that if one of the tanks stop working, the other would start supplying oxygen continuously. Other than the oxygen storage tanks, PGI also has oxygen cylinders on standby. There are over 1000 oxygen points at the institute.

Medical gas system check

According to officials, the PGI administration recently ordered a check of the medical gas system at the institute, following a tragedy in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, where children died due to shortage of oxygen at the hospital. At a meeting on Thursday, PGI Medical Superintendent Dr A K Gupta said after the Gorakhpur incident, he had immediately ordered the concerned official to revisit the whole process of medical gas supply at the institute.

A note of the meeting, seen by Chandigarh Newsline, said the OIC (officer in-charge) confirmed the availability of adequate supply of medical gases and the present system was not likely to face any adverse situation. It further said that the engineering services department “may be impressed by the urgency of upgrading the medical gases supply system at PGI”.

Not only PGI, other city hospitals, too, maintained that adequate supply of oxygen was available. Dr A K Janmeja, director and principal of Government Medical College and Hospital at Sector 32, said the hospital had a proper system in place to ensure continuous supply of oxygen. A Chandigarh health department official said additional cylinders were on standby at the hospitals to meet any exigency, apart from supplying oxygen regularly.

"Dabholkar murder case: Four yrs on, wait for justice continues","Dr Narendra Dabholkar. File Dr Narendra Dabholkar. File

FOUR years after anti-superstition activist Narendra Dabholkar was shot dead when he was on a morning walk on August 20, 2013, prime accused Sarang Akolkar (35) and Vinay Baburao Pawar (37), members of Sanatan Sanstha, continue to remain at large, away from the clutches of the CBI and the SIT who continue to beat a bare path in the case.

The duo had shot dead Dabholkar on August 20, 2013, around 7.25 am on the V R Shinde bridge in the city. For three years, there was no clue about the murder. On June 10, 2016, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Sanatan Sanstha seeker Virendra Tawde.

Along with Tawde, the CBI named Vinay Pawar, who has been missing since 2009, and Sarang Akolkar, who is absconding in the October 2009 Goa blast case, as prime suspects. The CBI claimed that Akolkar and Pawar are the two persons who opened fire on Dabholkar, causing his death.

In March this year, the CBI’s special crime branch announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh for the person giving information about Akolkar and Pawar. In the chargesheet filed against Tawde on September 8, 2016, the CBI mentioned the motive behind the murder as “long-standing enmity/hatred” between Dabholkar and his organisation, Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS), with Sanatan Sanstha. In the chargesheet, the CBI gave details of the alleged email conversation between Tawde and Akolkar, against whom a red corner notice was issued by Interpol in July 2012. “One email, dated April 20, 2009, from Akolkar to Tawde mentions about the availability of country-made arms (Deshi banavatiche sahitya) in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It also mentioned about foreign made arms (Pardeshi sahitya) availability in Assam. Here coded language has been used. It is also mentioned in email about the raising of the army of 15,000 persons for financial procurement of firearms (Sahitya), even theft could be committed, in case of need,” the chargesheet stated.

A statement given by a Hindutva activist, Sanjay Sadvilkar from Kolhapur, helped the CBI in the investigation. The CBI claims that even after Akolkar went absconding, Tawde’s association with him continued. The CBI mentions Tawde and Akolkar had a meeting with Sadvilkar in 2013. Tawde wanted to manufacture weapons with Sadvilkar’s help. “Akolkar had for this purpose brought samples of one country-made pistol and one country-made revolver of high quality,” it is stated. Sanatan Sanstha calls Sadvilkar a “bogus” witness. In August 2016, the special investigation team (SIT) of Kolhapur police took Tawde’s custody to probe his involvement in the murder of Communist leader Govind Pansare. Two persons had opened fire at Pansare and his wife, Uma, while they were returning home from morning walk on February 16, 2015. Pansare had while undergoing treatment at the hospital on February 20. Uma received bullet injury but survived. The SIT filed a supplementary chargesheet against Tawde on November 29, 2016, naming him as the prime conspirator and Akolkar, Vinay Pawar and Rudra Patil as wanted accused in the case. Earlier this month, the state government announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for the information about Akolkar and Pawar.

The ballistic reports

The Pune city police had arrested illegal firearms dealer Manish Nagori (24) and Vilas Khandelwal (22, on June 20, 2014, in the Dabholkar murder case. The arrest was on the basis of a ballistic report of firearms seized from the duo when they were arrested by Mumbra police in an extortion case on August 20, 2013, the day when Dabholkar was murdered in Pune. The report suggested that one of the firearms (seized from Khandelwal) matched with the “markings” on a cartridge seized from crime scene.

The CBI sent the samples of bullets and cartridges found at the crime scenes — Pune (Dabholkar murder), Kolhapur (Pansare murder) and Dharwad in Karnataka where Kannada scholar M M Kalburgi was shot dead on August 30, 2015 — to the New Scotland Yard police.

What they didn’t tell you: Coming out is a never-ending process,"What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar) What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar)

What do you want to be when you grow up?” a ninth grade English paper once asked me. It was a 20-mark essay, and I had 20 minutes to earn them. I rolled up my sleeves, and pulled out my cursive best.

The thing is, I wanted to be a great many things.I wanted to be a chef, an actor, a painter; I wanted to be an astronaut, and, for two weeks after I turned 11, I wanted to be a National Geographic correspondent — if only because my older sister said that she wanted to be one. From the age of six to 16, I raced through changes. My styles, my sexual leanings and my haircuts changed, and so did my dreams.Only, what did I never dream of being? Myself.

I was so used to pushing my problems under a hypothetical carpet, that I never realised the lies I was hoarding. It was an easy, lazy life. Through adolescence, I used this complacency as a security blanket, and wound it around myself whenever thoughts of the future terrified me. What would coming out (as a gay man) be like? Would I have to talk about my feelings? Would I have someone to talk about my feelings to (a fair question, because I grew up thinking that you were only allowed to talk about your feelings at expensive therapy sessions, sappy book clubs or when watching romantic tearjerkers)?

Growing up signified independence — no more staying at home, no more rules, no more restrictions, no more getting worried over your mother’s 18 missed calls (well, almost). But I didn’t know what I would do with all the freedom. Independence petrified me. What would I do being free? Would I finally have to be myself?

People are terrified to be themselves, especially when bravery is an option, and not an obligation. I’ve been called manipulative, selfish, a coward and a sore loser. Why would I want to be myself then? I’d rather be someone nicer and more admirable; I’d rather be someone else.

Some enjoy the peace that comes with accepting who they are, but most of us get stuck on the fence in the middle. Take sexuality, for instance. We can stir ourselves to walk free and fabulous, but we’d rather stay safe and sound in the cage of heteronormativity. I made myself feel at home in the cage till I was 21. The thing about independence, though, is that it doesn’t come gift-wrapped and express delivered to your front doorstep. It needs to be earned, or fought for.

Coming to terms with your sexuality and stepping out of the closet isn’t easy — especially in a country like India, where minds can be as narrow as Bandra’s bylanes, even if you are an upper-class, well-educated man (and sometimes, especially if you an upper-class, well-educated man). As countless films and American television shows have told us, you don’t just wake up one morning and walk out into the sunlit world. To reach the closet door, you need to push through your woollens, those “buy-one-get-one-free” shirts you bought on an impulse, and the odd tangle of smelly socks, greying underwear and smutty novels you don’t want your mother to find. It will be tough, especially if you’ve been hoarding — and holding back — all your life.

And even when you do, it’s a never-ending process. Those closet doors that everyone talks about? They are revolving. Week after week, you will find yourself coming out to friends, family, acquaintances, and (occasionally) drunken strangers at the bar. Perhaps, one day it will not be the big deal that it is today, and you won’t have to worry about whether your words are followed by a kiss to the cheek or a punch to the mouth. Every new acceptance is a fresh slice of independence, and you’ll wolf it all down.

Fortunately, my personal coming out story reeks of acceptance and Hallmark cards. I sat my parents down and told them everything in a diligently rehearsed 17-minute monologue. In 18 minutes, it was done. Questions were asked, hugs were exchanged, a tear was shed (that would be me). My mum went for a walk with her friends and my dad continued solving the crossword puzzle. They accepted it with a simple shrug (and lots of love and support over the next couple of years, but this is not that story). My sexuality was just another fact.

What about the war of words I had been expecting? The emotional bloodshed? The years of torment at the hands of society? They never came, even though history books said that they would. Times are changing, and somewhere over pop culture references and more inclusive media representations, my parents and peers had changed as well. The history books had it wrong.

What they did get right was this — freedom felt liberating. The freedom to stay single. To be a sexual deviant. The freedom to wear a skirt (if you are a man) or a jersey (if you are a woman). The freedom to wear both, or neither. The freedom to never find your way back home.

What do we do with the freedom then? Do we let it consume us? Terrify us into never seeking it out? We do neither. We simply unwind and enjoy it with a cup of tea. Preferably, chamomile.

Venezuela’s constituent assembly assumes power to legislate,"Governments around the world have slammed the creation of the constituent assembly, with many accusing Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro of seeking to ignore the will of the people who want a change of government.

Venezuela’s new legislative superbody on Friday gave itself the power to pass laws, superseding the opposition-led congress and fueling criticism by government adversaries that socialist President Nicolas Maduro is consolidating a dictatorship. In practice, the move does little to change the existing situation. The Socialist-dominated Supreme Court has stripped power from the congress and shot down nearly every law it has approved since it was taken over by the opposition in 2016.

But the decision suggests the constituent assembly, elected in July in a vote boycotted by the opposition, is more interested in limiting the opposition’s influence than carrying out its official task of rewriting the nation’s constitution.

Delcy Rodriguez, a Maduro ally and president of the constituent assembly, insisted the move did not imply a dissolution of the congress.

“Those lazy bums have to work. What we are doing is telling them: ‘Gentlemen, we are not going to let you take a holiday’,” Rodriguez said in a reference to opposition legislators.

South American trade bloc Mercosur condemned the assembly for usurping congress’s responsibilities, according to a statement released by Brazil’s Foreign Ministry.

Mercosur founding members Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay will not recognize any measures taken by the assembly, the statement said.

The assembly had invited leaders of the existing congress to join the session. Congressional leaders did not attend, insisting it was fraudulently created and usurped their powers.

“(Congress) only obeys the constitution and the people. We do not recognize the constituent assembly, much less subordinate ourselves to it,” Freddy Guevara, an opposition politician and vice president of the congress, wrote on Twitter.

Maduro pushed for the creation of the constituent assembly on promises it would bring peace to the country after months of violent street protests that have killed more than 125 people.

Critics say the assembly was created to extend the rule of the Socialists, who face anger across the country over chronic food shortages, triple-digit inflation and a severe recession.

Protests have slowed since the July 30 election, partly because opposition leaders are in talks to present candidates for the gubernatorial elections expected in October. Many opposition supporters are also tired and demoralized.

Governments around the world have slammed the creation of the constituent assembly, with many accusing Maduro of seeking to ignore the will of Venezuelans who want a change of government. The United States has slapped sanctions on top Socialist Party officials, accusing them, among other things, of weakening democracy and violating human rights. Washington has said it will consider sanctions against anyone who participates in the constituent assembly.

Jermain Defoe in line to start for Bournemouth,"Jermain Defoe could make his first start for Bournemouth in 16 years. (Source: Reuters) Jermain Defoe could make his first start for Bournemouth in 16 years. (Source: Reuters)

Jermain Defoe could make his first start for Bournemouth in 16 years at home to Watford on Saturday, manager Eddie Howe told a news conference on Friday.

The former England striker left relegated Sunderland in the close-season and came on as a substitute in the 1-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion last weekend.

He was on loan at Bournemouth as a teenager in 2000-01, famously scoring in 10 successive league matches. “Jermain felt a tightness in his groin after the Valencia pre-season game and he felt it before the West Bromwich game, but he is in contention to start,” Howe said.

Bournemouth finished ninth last season, rising from 16th the previous year in their first-ever campaign in the top flight of English football.

Mo Farah wins his farewell track race in Britain,"Mo Farah will become a marathon man next season. (Source: Reuters) Mo Farah will become a marathon man next season. (Source: Reuters)

Mo Farah brought down the curtain on his peerless track career in Britain by winning his farewell race on home soil on an emotional afternoon at the Birmingham Grand Prix Diamond League meeting on Sunday. In his penultimate track race — his final run will be at the Zurich Weltklasse meeting on Thursday — before becoming a marathon man on the roads next season, the quadruple Olympic champion outclassed a 3,000 metres field with familiar elan.

The weekend after winning 5,000 metres silver and a fortnight since his 10,000 metres triumph at the World Championships in London, the 34-year-old was presented with a more accommodating field for his domestic goodbye.

The crowd at the Alexander Stadium gave Britain’s greatest racer — perhaps the best the world has seen too after 10 global title wins — a rapturous reception before watching him sprint away one last time down the home straight as he won in 7 minutes 38.64 seconds.

Farah, who clocked 56.89 seconds over the last lap to ease away from Spain’s runner-up, Adel Mechaal, the fourth-placed finisher in the world 1500 metres final, told the BBC: “It means everything to me.

“The emotion was high and I had a lot of support from the home crowd. This is what we dream of — having a home crowd cheer you on — and I want to thank everyone who has supported me and followed my journey.

“I never dreamed of becoming four times Olympic champion and a multi world champion. All I ever dreamed of was competing for Britain.

“Now I just want to continue to see what I can do on the road, without having a target on my back, and just try to enjoy it without so much pressure. I’m going to a completely new game on the roads with a new mind and I’m excited.”

Five more newly-crowned world champions celebrated their London triumphs in style, headed by Qatari’s magnificent high jumper Mutaz Essa Barshim, who produced the performance of the meeting with the world’s best jump of the year, 2.40 metres.

Barshim again demonstrated why Javier Sotomayor’s world record of 2.45 metres is under threat with his clearance that pleased him so much, he promised to leave with the high jump bar as a souvenir.

“I knew I was in good shape. I felt good and went for it,” he said, clutching the bar. “That jump was amazing, I’m taking that bar home!”

Other world champions to thrive were Greece’s Ekaterini Stefanidi, who won her 12th consecutive pole vault competition (4.75 metres) and Ramil Guliyev, Turkey’s surprise 200 metres winner, who again forged away strongly from a quality field to win in 20.17 seconds.

Croatia’s discus colossus Sandra Perkovic, who won a second world gold to add to her two Olympic golds, was again in a different league, unleashing a 67.51m winning throw, while New Zealand’s shotput winner Tom Walsh prevailed again with a 21.83m winner.

Elaine Thompson, who surprisingly missed out in London, hit her best form a fortnight too late as she raced to victory in a high-class 100 metres.

Jamaica’s double Olympic sprint champion, whose poor fifth place finish in the world championships 100 metres was one of the meet’s major surprises, clocked 10.93 seconds to remain unbeaten in the Diamond League this year.

She ousted London silver medallist Marie-Josee Ta Lou by four-hundredths of a second while bronze medallist Dafne Schippers, who also won the 200m crown in London, finished sixth in 11.22.

Pakistan and Afghanistan on Saturday recognised terrorism as their “common enemy” as the two countries agreed to deepen cooperation to eliminate the “menace”, an official statement said. Pakistan Foreign Office said the visiting Afghan Deputy Foreign Minister Nasir Andesha called on Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua and the two discussed ways to strengthen bilateral ties in diverse fields as well as improving efforts for lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan.

“Recognising that terrorism was a common enemy of the two countries and its peoples, Foreign Secretary and the Afghan Deputy Foreign Minister agreed for deepening cooperation and coordinating in counter-terrorism efforts with a view to eliminate this menace,” Foreign office said in a statement. Janjua underlined the need for enhancing economic cooperation, trade, transit and connectivity for the mutual benefit of the people of both the countries.

She emphasised on the need to expedite infrastructure and energy connectivity projects between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Andesha is visiting Pakistan to mark Afghanistan’s Independence Day celebrations and for the foundation-laying ceremony of the new Afghan Embassy in the Diplomatic Enclave in Islamabad.

Earlier, Janjua visited Kabul on August 15 for meetings with Afghan leadership to strengthen bilateral relations. Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan had strained due to cross border terrorism attacks which led to months of tensions and war of words between the two countries.

Pakistan had closed down its borders with Afghanistan at Chaman and Torkham in February following terrorist attacks blamed on militants who have taken sanctuary across the border. The border points were opened after a month on the orders of the prime minister after millions of dollars were lost in trading and business between the two countries.

Nervous Japan holds evacuation drill in case North Korea fires missiles over them,"Nearly 130 people took part in the drill in Kotoura, which has a population of 18,000. (Source: AP) Nearly 130 people took part in the drill in Kotoura, which has a population of 18,000. (Source: AP)

Residents of a town on the Japanese coast held evacuation drills on Saturday to prepare for any launch of North Korean missiles towards the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, that would fly over their homes. As sirens blared from speakers in the town of Kotoura, children playing soccer outside ran to take shelter in a school, along with their parents and their team coach.

“I’ve been concerned every day that something might fall or a missile could fall in an unexpected place due to North Korea’s missile capabilities,” said the coach, Akira Hamakawa, 38. North Korea’s rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons and missiles has fuelled a surge in tension across the region. U.S. President Donald Trump warned North Korea this month it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States. The North responded by threatening to fire missiles towards the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam. Any such missiles would have to fly over western Japan.

While North Korea later said it was holding off firing towards Guam, tension remains high and annual joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea beginning on Monday are likely to enrage Pyongyang.

Nearly 130 people took part in the drill in Kotoura, which has a population of 18,000, a town official said. For 10 minutes, people ducked down covering their heads with their arms. Many of those taking part said they were worried. North Korea has in the past threatened to attack Japan, a staunch U.S. ally and host to U.S. military bases. Japan is the only country in the world to be attacked with nuclear weapons. Authorities are publishing notices in newspapers, on television and online, advising people to take shelter in robust buildings and to keep away from windows should missiles land. Evacuation drills, however, have only been held in remote towns such as Kotoura.

A North Korean missile could reach Japan in about 10 minutes. “A lot of people participated in the drill with a sense of emergency,” said Yosuke Suenaga, the cabinet counsellor of situation response and crisis management.

Atletico Madrid dig deep to draw at Girona after Antoine Griezmann sees red,"Antoine Griezmann had been sent off for the first time in his career. (Source: File) Antoine Griezmann had been sent off for the first time in his career. (Source: File)

Atletico Madrid demonstrated their remarkable team spirit to come roaring back from two goals and a man down to draw 2-2 at Liga debutants Girona on Saturday, after Antoine Griezmann had been sent off for the first time in his career.

Girona looked set to enjoy a dream top flight bow when Uruguay international Cristhian Stuani rose to head in a sweeping cross from Alex Granell midway through the first half and three minutes later showed his predator’s instinct to nod in a loose ball from close range.

Argentine forward Angel Correa pulled one back for Atletico with a long range strike in the 78th minute, after Griezmann had been dismissed for two successive bookings, one for diving to try and win a penalty and another for dissent.

Defender Jose Gimenez then beat Girona goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz to Koke’s chipped free-kick to head Atletico level in the 85th minute and cap a thrilling encounter at the Montilivi stadium, which was hastily expanded for the club’s first Liga game.

“Girona are a solid team that knows how they want to play and they proved that in the first half, but I’m delighted with the good things we did, we again showed that we never give up and keep fighting until the end,” Atletico coach Diego Simeone told reporters.

Girona boss Pablo Machin said: “We were on our way to a memorable win, not just because it was a historic game for us but because of how we played. Just when it looked like we’d done everything to win, Atletico did what champions do and as well as their quality they had that slice of luck which we didn’t.”

Stuani returned to Spain this summer after two years at Middlesbrough and already has half the amount of league goals with Girona he managed last season. His quick-fire strikes had the home supporters on their feet as they savoured the club’s first game in the top flight in their 87-year history.

Atletico nearly struck back early in the second half when Griezmann launched himself acrobatically at a high through ball, but his bicycle kick flew past the far post.

Once Correa had got them back in the game with his sublime strike, substitute Luciano Vietto should have levelled when he was played in the area, only to blast over the bar. Girona tired despite their numerical advantage and Gimenez eventually pulled Atletico out of trouble.

Elsewhere on Saturday, Real Sociedad twice came from behind to win 3-2 at Celta Vigo, snatching three points with a late penalty from Willian Jose after Uruguayan Maxi Gomez had scored twice on his debut for Celta.

Sevilla meanwhile drew 1-1 at home to Espanyol, with Argentine midfielder Ever Banega being sent off for two successive yellow cards on his first game back at the Andalusian club, one for a foul and the other for protesting the foul.

"Gurpreet Singh Sindhu will be a better keeper at Bengaluru FC, says Stephen Constantine","Gurpreet Singh Sandhu signed for Bengaluru FC. (Source: Twitter) Gurpreet Singh Sandhu signed for Bengaluru FC. (Source: Twitter)

After Bengaluru FC signed India keeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, who ended a three-year contract with Norwegian club Stabaek FC, India head coach Stephen Constantine said that it was important for the 25-year old to play regularly.

Constantine was quoted by Firstpost as saying, “I think Gurpreet has made his decision and we should respect this. I think it was important for him that he goes somewhere where he’s going to play.

“At Bengaluru, he will play. He did not start in Stabaek which was a concern for me and I told him last year that you need to be playing games if you have to go to the next level,” said Constantine, who confirmed that he will not be keeping any of the Blues in his squad for the upcoming triangular tournament.

“I think at Bengaluru if he gets 20-30 games under his belt in a season, he will be a better keeper for that. And then if he decides to go out after that, then obviously that’s his decision,” he added.

Gurpreet, who became the first Indian player to be signed from a European club, said after signing a one-year contract with Bengaluru that he took up the offer despite having the option of playing for a top flight club in Europe.

"As US debates policy, Afghan pilots fear for families’ lives","In this August 10, 2017, President Donald Trump, accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, speaks to reporters before a security briefing at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. (Source: AP Photo) In this August 10, 2017, President Donald Trump, accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, speaks to reporters before a security briefing at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. (Source: AP Photo)

As the Trump administration debates war strategy in Afghanistan, this Afghan pilot in the US-backed Afghan Air Force has more pressing concerns: He’s worried the Taliban may kidnap or kill his family. Like other colleagues flying A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft, he told Reuters he has received death threats. One came in the form a note left on the door of his home in Kabul. “It said: ‘If you don’t quit, we’re going to kidnap your kids and kill you’,” the pilot said in an interview, asking not to be identified due to fears for his security.

His children are aged 2, 3, 6 and 7. Three other pilots said such threats were common among Super Tucano pilots, whose skills are quickly becoming among the most sought after assets in the Afghan arsenal. Two said they wanted the Afghan government to do more to help protect their families. Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.

The fledgling Afghan Air Force (AAF) is a bright spot in a 16-year-old war against Taliban insurgents that American commanders say is at a stalemate, and any future US plans to aid the Afghan military will almost certainly involve strengthening its air power.

US President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and his national security team are scheduled to discuss Afghan war strategy, and regional policy guiding it, at a meeting at Camp David on Friday.

Even if Trump approves sending thousands more American troops, recruiting, training and retaining Afghan pilots and aircraft maintenance crews is expected to remain a major priority of the US effort.

The 17 Afghan Super Tucano pilots are particularly precious, taking years to train, including in the United States. After dropping their first bomb in April 2016, Afghan Super Tucano pilots are now regularly flying combat missions, something that was hard to imagine just a few years ago.

That appears to have made them targets. In one case cited by two Super Tucano pilots, a car bomb badly injured an A-29 pilot last year. Wounded in a leg, he no longer flies, they said.

US Air Force Major General James Hecker, commander of the 9th Expeditionary Task Force – Afghanistan, told Reuters the US military was aware of the pilots’ accounts and has discussed the matter with the Afghan government.

“That is something we are very concerned about,” Hecker said. Afghanistan’s defense ministry said it was also aware of the concerns. Ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri said measures had been taken to protect the pilots but he declined to offer details, saying that disclosure could compromise their security.

“Overall, there is a plan to protect them, especially those who are directly involved in operations against the terrorists,” Waziri said.

ASYLUM REQUEST

The first female fixed-wing pilot in Afghanistan’s air force made headlines in December for requesting asylum in the United States after completing an 18-month training course there. She was certified to fly a C-208 military cargo aircraft.

In a US State Department award citation, it said she and her family had received direct threats not just from the Taliban but also from some relatives, forcing her family to move house several times.

None of the A-29 pilots suggested they were seeking asylum, however, only protection for their families. They appeared proud of their training and eager to fight the Taliban.

The Super Tucanos are built in the United States under an agreement between their Brazilian manufacturer, Embraer and Sierra Nevada Corp.

The aim of the expanding US assistance is to build an Afghan air force able to support counter-insurgency forces fighting in remote and forbidding terrain with air strikes, supplies and intelligence.

The AAF has about 120 aircraft in service, ranging from small propeller Cessna 208s to old Soviet-era helicopters, as well as the A-29s, MD-530s and veteran C-130 Hercules transporters.

In June, an Afghan air crew parachuted about 400 kg of supplies to an isolated border police outpost, the first time the AAF had conducted an aerial supply drop.

In coming years, the old Russian Mi-17s helicopters, which are increasingly difficult to maintain, will be replaced by American UH-60 Black Hawks.

The planned acquisitions will cost $6.78 billion over the next six years, according to the US military. That does not include maintenance, which is heavily dependent on pricey foreign contractors.

The aim is to increase the effectiveness of the security forces, which advisers hope to get to a point where the Taliban are forced to negotiate a political settlement.

As the AAF has grown, however, it has faced increasing pressure from army units to step up operations. Advisers say one of the main risks it faces is overstretch.

"Each player has to look themselves in the mirror and see where they can improve, says Jason Holder","Jason Holder has called upon his troops to look themselves in the mirror and put in a better performance. (Source: AP) Jason Holder has called upon his troops to look themselves in the mirror and put in a better performance. (Source: AP)

After suffering a defeat by an innings and 209-run against England, a disappointed West Indies captain Jason Holder has called upon his troops to look themselves in the mirror and put in a better performance.

Speaking to the media, Holder, recalled the performance and said, “It’s been a tough few days, we were disappointing in this Test match. We lacked consistency when we bowled and we didn’t put up any runs,” We got beaten in three days and just weren’t up to scratch. -We have to regroup — it’s only one Test, and we can’t drop our heads down,” and added, “The series is not lost… I have to believe, (because) every team is beatable. (But) each player has to look themselves in the mirror and see where they can improve. We didn’t show enough fight,” Holder said after the match. We were totally outplayed.”

Stressing on the importance of self-belief, he said, “We’ve got to just believe, we have a few days off now, we have to use them wisely. We’ll sit and talk, and formulate some plans about how we are going to go, but it’s not impossible [to come back]. It’s just one game, the series is not lost, we have believe, regroup, and come back strongly.”

Commenting on the where it wrong for the Windies, Holder analyzed and said, “There’s inexperience in the side but we have to be professional and get over that,” said Holder. “I thought we were in the game for a session, but Cook and [Joe] Root put on a really good partnership and we were struggling in the end. We’re a young side with nothing to lose, we just have to believe and come back strongly.”

First video review in Serie A leads to saved penalty,"Juventus have had a difficult few months. They lost their second Champions League final in three years. (Source: Reuters) Juventus have had a difficult few months. They lost their second Champions League final in three years. (Source: Reuters)

The opening match in Serie A also produced the first decision from video review on Saturday. The Video Assistant Referee awarded a penalty to Cagliari but Diego Farias’ effort was saved by Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and the Bianconeri went on to win 3-0.

“I don’t want to comment on the VAR, just as before I didn’t comment on the referees’ decisions,” Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said. “I’ll only say that luckily we have Buffon in goal: He’s still the best.”

Juventus have had a difficult few months: Losing its second Champions League final in three years and key defender Leonardo Bonucci moving to AC Milan amid reports of infighting. It also lost the Italian Super Cup to Lazio last weekend.

“Considering that at the beginning of the season there’s a bit of sparkle lacking, we did well,” Allegri said. “When the team works together in defense it’s difficult for our opponents to shoot on goal. In preseason we always conceded, and that was a sign that something wasn’t working.”

It took the Bianconeri less than 12 minutes to open the scoring when Mario Mandzukic volleyed in Stephan Lichtsteiner’s cross. This is the first season that Serie A has introduced video technology, and it got its first use at the end of the first half.

Duje Cop went down under Alex Sandro’s challenge and, after a bit of hesitation, referee Fabio Maresca summoned video reviews. After consulting with the VAR and looking at the incident on a pitchside monitor, he gave a penalty to Cagliari.

Buffon saved Farias’ penalty and Juventus doubled its lead in first-half stoppage time when Dybala controlled Miralem Pjanic’s ball over the top and fired it home.

Gonzalo Higuain extended Juve’s lead shortly after the hour with a precise strike into the bottom far corner after being set up by Alex Sandro.

New Juventus signings Blaise Matuidi and Douglas Costa made their Serie A debuts after joining from Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich respectively.

VAR FOR NAPOLI TOO

Video technology was also called upon in Napoli’s 3-1 victory at newly promoted Hellas Verona. Napoli took the lead when Verona goalkeeper Nicolas flapped at a corner and it bounced off Samuel Souprayen’s shin and into the net for an own goal.

Michael Fabbri consulted with the VAR to check whether there was a foul on Nicolas before awarding the goal.”(Kalidou) Koulibaly’s hand was on Nicolas, but the VAR judged it how it did and anyway I don’t think it would have changed the outcome of the match,” Verona coach Fabio Pecchia.

Napoli doubled its lead minutes later when Lorenzo Insigne counterattacked and Arkadiusz Milik slotted across into the bottom left corner. It was the Poland international’s first league start since injuring his knee in October.

The third came when Nicolas parried Dries Mertens’ effort but Faouzi Ghoulam chipped in the rebound. The only negative point for Napoli was the sending off of defender Elseid Hysaj. Substitute Giampaolo Pazzini, who was the top goal-scorer in the second division last season, converted the resulting penalty.

Donald Trump drops plan to create infrastructure council: White House,"President Donald Trump (Source: AP Photo/File) President Donald Trump (Source: AP Photo/File)

US President Donald Trump has abandoned plans to create an infrastructure advisory council, the White House said on Thursday, the day after two other advisory groups were dismantled over the furor caused by Trump’s remarks on white supremacists. “The President’s Advisory Council on Infrastructure, which was still being formed, will not move forward,” a White House official said. The decision to drop the planned council was first reported by Bloomberg.

Trump signed an executive order last month establishing the council, with members to be drawn from real estate, construction, transportation and other sectors of the economy.

Trump has proposed spending $1 trillion to fix aging US roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure, a major part of his legislative agenda along with healthcare and tax reform.

On Wednesday, Trump disbanded two high-profile advisory groups after several chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend on anti-racism activists as well as white nationalists.

Trump said he dissolved the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum “rather than putting pressure” on its members, although both groups were preparing to disband on their own when Trump made his announcement on Twitter.

The snubs from chief executives raised questions about Trump’s ability to marshal the business community behind his policy goals.

A Wall Street analyst, Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said that because the infrastructure panel had yet to get off the ground, its demise was less important than the scrapping of the other two groups. “But it contributes to the uncertainty that’s creeping in” about Trump’s agenda, Hellwig said.

Boston march against hate speech avoids Charlottesville chaos,"Counter protesters clash with Boston Police outside of the Boston Commons and the Boston Free Speech Rally in Boston. (Source: Reuters) Counter protesters clash with Boston Police outside of the Boston Commons and the Boston Free Speech Rally in Boston. (Source: Reuters)

Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Boston on Saturday to protest a “free speech” rally featuring far-right speakers a week after a woman was killed at a Virginia white-supremacist demonstration. Rally organizers had invited several far-right speakers who were confined to a small pen that police set up in the historic Boston Common park to keep the two sides separate. The city avoided a repeat of last weekend’s bloody street battles in Charlottesville, Virginia, where one woman was killed.

Police estimated that as many as 40,000 people packed into the streets around the nation’s oldest park. Officials had spent a week planning security for the event, mobilizing 500 police officers, including many on bikes, and placing barricades and large white dump trucks on streets along the park, aiming to deter car-based attacks like those seen in Charlottesville and Europe. The rally never numbered more than a few dozen people, and its speakers could not be heard due to the shouts of those protesting it and the wide security cordon between the two sides. It wrapped up about an hour earlier than planned.

Protesters surrounded people leaving the rally, shouting “shame” and “go home” and occasionally throwing plastic water bottles. Police escorted several rally participants through the crowds, sometimes struggling against protesters who tried to stop them. Some people dressed in black with covered faces several times swarmed rally attendees, including two men wearing the “Make America Great Again” caps from President Donald Trump’s campaign.

The violence in Charlottesville triggered the biggest domestic crisis yet for Trump, who provoked ire across the political spectrum for not immediately condemning white nationalists and for praising “very fine people” on both sides of the fight. On Saturday, Trump on Twitter praised the Boston protesters. “I want to applaud the many protestors in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate. Our country will soon come together as one!” Trump tweeted. “Our great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heal, & we will heal, & be stronger than ever before!”

ARRESTS, TENSIONS

Thirty-three people were arrested, largely for scuffles in which some protesters threw rocks and bottles of urine at police dressed in riot gear, the Boston Police Department said. “There was a little bit of a confrontation,” Police Commissioner William Evans told reporters, adding that “99.9 percent of the people who were here were here for the right reasons.” Several protesters said they were unsurprised that the “Free Speech” event broke up early. “They heard our message loud and clear: Boston will not tolerate hate,” said Owen Toney, a 58-year-old community activist who attended the anti-racism protest. “I think they’ll think again about coming here.”

US tensions over hate speech have ratcheted up sharply after the Charlottesville clashes during the latest in a series of white supremacist marches.

White nationalists had converged in the Southern university city to defend a statue of Robert E. Lee, who led the pro-slavery Confederacy’s army during the Civil War, which ended in 1865. A growing number of U.S. political leaders have called for the removal of statues honoring the Confederacy, with civil rights activists charging that they promote racism. Advocates of the statues contend they are a reminder of their heritage.

Organizers of Saturday’s rally in Boston denounced the white supremacist message and violence of Charlottesville and said their event would be peaceful.

Republican US Senate candidate Shiva Ayyadurai spoke at the rally, surrounded by supporters holding “Black Lives Matter” signs. “We have a full spectrum of people here,” Ayyadurai said in a video of his speech posted on Twitter. “We have people from the Green Party here, we have Bernie (Sanders) supporters here, we’ve got people who believe in nationalism.” Protesters also began gathering on Saturday evening in Texas, with the Houston chapter of Black Lives Matter holding a rally to remove a “Spirit of the Confederacy” monument from a park. In Dallas, where a Lee statue was vandalized overnight, about 1,000 people gathered near City Hall to demonstrate against white supremacy.

A man who appeared waving a Confederate flag was quickly surrounded by at least 100 demonstrators. “Shame on you,” they chanted. Police officers escorted the man out of the plaza a few minutes later as the crowd cheered. While Boston has a reputation as one of the nation’s most liberal cities, it also has a history of racist outbursts, most notably riots against the desegregation of schools in the 1970s. Karla Venegas, a 22-year-old who recently moved to Boston from California, said she was not surprised that the Free Speech rally petered out so quickly. “They were probably scared away by the large crowd,” Venegas said.

"After firing, Steve Bannon returns to his ‘killing machine’","Bannon had told friends he is worth tens of millions of dollars, is a worldwide leader in the populist-nationalist movement that propelled Trump to power. (File Photo) Bannon had told friends he is worth tens of millions of dollars, is a worldwide leader in the populist-nationalist movement that propelled Trump to power. (File Photo)

With Stephen Bannon, the worry always was that he could be even more disruptive to President Donald Trump’s White House from outside than he was within. In the hours following his firing on Friday, those fears seemed warranted, as the conservative voices who viewed Bannon as one of their own howled in rage over Trump’s decision to fire his chief strategist. The reaction was most notable from Breitbart News, the hard-right news site that Bannon ran before he joined Trump’s presidential campaign last year.

“WAR,” tweeted one of the site’s editors, Joel Pollak, who published a piece questioning whether Trump would now move in a more moderate direction with Bannon out of the White House. “Steve Bannon personified the Trump agenda,” Pollak wrote. Bannon rejoined Breitbart as executive chairman only hours after his firing was announced. He is now expected to use it as a platform to blast those within the White House – and perhaps Trump himself – when they don’t hew to the fiercely nationalist policies Bannon advocated as an inside adviser. As Trump’s chief strategist, Bannon fought numerous battles with senior Trump aides and top Republicans in Congress over the administration’s policy agenda. Breitbart frequently backed him up, ripping establishment Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan, blaming them for obstructing Trump’s agenda. More recently, the site trained its fire on Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, after he removed officials who espoused Bannon’s foreign-policy world view.

In recent days, Bannon had told friends he is worth tens of millions of dollars, is a worldwide leader in the populist-nationalist movement that propelled Trump to power, and could go back to Breitbart, which he refers to as a “killing machine”, or perhaps other endeavors financed by the family of hedge-fund tycoon Robert Mercer, his longtime ally. “Steve has a powerful voice, and he’s going to keep that voice up,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser and Bannon friend. “He’s going to continue to promote policies that got Donald Trump in the White House.”

Bannon had clashed with the likes of Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Jared Kushner, a Trump adviser and the president’s son-in-law, both of whom favored more business-friendly, mainstream economic policies on trade, taxes, and other matters. While Bannon’s ouster may mean a short-term win for the relative moderates in the West Wing, those he dubbed the “globalists,” it does not mean that policy battles on national security, immigration and the economy will dissipate.

Trump has a shown a proclivity for seeking counsel from former advisers such as Corey Lewandowski and Newt Gingrich and from conservative pundits such as Sean Hannity. The outspoken and provocative Bannon could join their number. And there remain other White House officials sympathetic to Bannon’s world view, such as domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller. Even so, Bannon’s absence will be felt. “Trump is always going to be Trump on immigration, trade, and foreign policy. But Steve was the highest-ranking adviser who shared Trump’s world view. With him gone there’s not a replacement for that voice in internal debates,” one administration official said. “I think people have always overestimated how influential anyone can be on Trump. But without Steve constantly pushing back on every policy idea coming from the so-called ‘globalists,’ it’s easy to see how they could have a chance to start winning more policy battles.”

Mike Cernovich, an alt-right activist and personality, suggested to his more than 300,000 followers on Twitter that Bannon was sacked to ensure that the White House raises troop levels in Afghanistan, which Bannon opposed. “This is a full-on coup now, guys,” Cernovich said in a posted video. Beyond Breitbart and the alt-right, some more traditional conservative groups were also concerned about the implications of Bannon’s departure. Twenty Republican grassroots leaders, including longtime activists Richard Viguerie, Jenny Beth Martin, and Ginni Thomas, wrote to Trump earlier in the week urging him to keep Bannon on.

“We will miss Steve Bannon in the White House because he helped President Trump keep many of the promises he made on the campaign trail,” Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, said in a statement after Bannon’s ouster. But she also reiterated her support for the president, saying “he is his own man.” If Bannon has anything to do with it, he will push to make sure that Trump stays that way. But some supporters still worried that the radical agenda Bannon fought for could be at risk. “It’s a sad day for the movement,” Nunberg said. “I think it will end up being a mistake.”

Sketches of a Poet’s soul,"Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature. Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature.

Book- Faiz Ahmad Faiz: Colour of My Heart, Selected Poems

Translated by- Baran Farooqi

Publication- Penguin Random House India

Pages- 304

Price- Rs 499

The name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds most people of melodious voices of Noor Jahan and Nayyara Noor, and the songs Mujh Se Pahli Si Muhobbat Meri Mehboob Na Mang, Ham Dekhenge or Aaj Bazar Mein Paa-ba Jolan Chalo. For those who have a deeper interest in Urdu poetry, it evokes many more images. Faiz symbolises a turning point in the history of the Urdu language — his name evokes memories of the Progressive Writers Association (PWA), his poetry is reminiscent of an era when the best of minds produced great literature in Urdu, which inspires writers and poets even today.

Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature. No nation state has been able to create impermeable fortifications thick enough to withstand the osmotic pressure which arts and literature produces. Even if these walls are constructed on the dense bedrock of hate and animosity.

Faiz’s poetry kept on transcending geographical boundaries and made him the most celebrated poet of the Indian subcontinent. But what makes Faiz unique, and I have said this earlier in an article, is that his poetry also transcends caste, class, regional and even linguistic boundaries. It is not unusual to see processions in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, where workers, students or political activists walk on streets with posters on which Bol Ke Lab Azaad Hain Tere or Nisar Main Teri Galyon Pe Aye Watan Ke Jahan, Chali Hai Rasm Ke Koi Na Sar Uttha Ke Chale is written. If you walk into a five star hotel and witness Faiz being sung by a renowned singer, it would not be considered out of the ordinary. Faiz is the only poet who has no adversaries. Even the mullahs in Pakistan did not pass a fatwa against him.

Faiz’s name also reminds us of the great divide between taraqqi pasand (the progressives) and jadidiyat pasand (modernists). Those who called themselves modernists in India were essentially anti-communist, backed by international groups who professed ‘art for the sake of art’ and ‘art with no political objective’. This group consistently attacked all writers, poets, filmmakers and artists who were members of PWA. Their politics drove them to condemn and reject all those who were committed to the idea of equality and justice, and created literature to build consciousness around these ideals.

Faiz demolished the wall created by the modernists. They initially tried to ignore him but did not succeed. In an Urdu magazine, Tehrik (Silver Jubilee Number), Wazir Agha wrote an article on ‘25 years of Urdu literature in Pakistan’. He listed the names of 30 poets, without mentioning Faiz. In passing elsewhere in the article, he mentioned Faiz as a progressive poet who “did not toe the party line and therefore created some good literary pieces”.

Similarly in Guftugoo, Balraj Komal, in an article titled ‘Poetry of Straight and Curvilinear Lines’, placed Faiz’s work on the border of this divide vis-a-vis Ali Sardar Jafri, Sahir Ludhyanvi and Josh Malihabadi; and, therefore categorised it as ‘effective’. These assertions were utterly false because Faiz remained committed to the ideals of socialism till his last breath. These were only excuses for liking a revolutionary poet. Almost every word of his poetry is dedicated to the idea of building an equitable and just society, yet his grandeur was accepted by even those who stood on the other side of the political fence.

The book Faiz Ahmad Faiz: Colour of My Heart, Selected Poems provides yet more proof of my assertion. In her introduction, the translator, Baran Farooqui, has made her political position very clear. She has referred to Faiz and many other progressive writers as “armchair socialists”, ignoring the fact that some of them, including Faiz, spent long years in jail for their ideological commitment. An unnecessary reference to Stalin could also have been avoided. She has not minced her words to reveal her unsympathetic attitude towards Faiz’s political views. The rest of the introduction is full of ‘illuminating’ information and she has translated the poems with utmost care, restrain and thoughtfulness. The soft, firm and robust ‘king of romantic realism’ deserves no less, even from those who do not agree with him. The ideological bias is completely absent in the translation.

When I read the list of 57 selected poems I was a bit disappointed that Intisab, Raqeeb Se, and Mauzu-e-Sukhan were missing. But when I moved on to the introduction it was clear that these poems did not measure up to the taste of the selector for obvious reasons.

If you are in love with a piece of literature in its original form — and I am an unashamed lover of every poem that Faiz wrote — then it is painful to read its translation. For me there are two indicators of good translation. The first test is: choose lines from the middle of a poem, read, and if you are able to recollect the original, then it is a good translation. I performed this test on every poem in this book. The second test is: the translated poem must invoke the same or similar feeling which the original does. Farooqi’s translation passes both these tests with very high marks. For all those who understand Urdu but cannot read ‘farsi rasm-ul khat’ the appendix provides transliteration of all selected poems, carefully scripted with the correct pronunciation of each word.

Farooqi refers to seven translators who introduced Faiz to non-Urdu readers, during his lifetime. I have not read all of them, but on the basis of whatever I’ve gone through, Farooqi’s translation is incredibly close to the spirit of Faiz’s poetry. I’m sure after reading this book, non-Urdu-Hindi readers will gain a deeper understanding of his life and poetry.

Congress begins consultations with traders for manifesto: Party to appoint 4 working presidents,"Madhusudan Mistry and Siddharth Patel are likely to hold key poll panel posts. Madhusudan Mistry and Siddharth Patel are likely to hold key poll panel posts.

The Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) is likely to appoint four working presidents to assist the state party chief Bharatsinh Solanki for Assembly poll preparations. Sources said that the party will appoint MLAs Paresh Dhanani and Ashwin Kotwal, former MP Jagdish Thakore and former minister Tushar Chaudhary as working presidents.

Sources said that the initiative was being taken to satisfy all social and caste groups important from the election point of view.

According to the sources, former state party president Siddharth Patel is likely to be appointed as chairman of the election campaign committee and former MP Madhusudan Mistry as chairman of the election manifesto committee.

Besides, three new vice-presidents, five general secretaries and four spokespersons are also to be appointed.

State Congress chief Solanki, when questioned, said the appointments were to be made within a week. However, he did not reveal the names.

Meanwhile, senior party leader Deepak Babariya on Saturday reached Surat to consult traders and take their inputs as party begun consultations for its manifesto.

The impact of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on various industries, especially diamond and textiles, may get a prominent place in the Congress party’s manifesto.

Babariya met textile, jari, diamonds and embroidery traders and discussed issues affecting their business. He also met trade union leaders.

It is to be noted that textile traders in Surat have been protesting against the five per cent GST on their industry. Though they have called off their strike after receiving assurances from the state government and Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, their protest against the GST continues.

“The meeting will help us in preparing the roadmap of Congress manifesto for the Assembly elections. We heard that textile industry is badly hit by the GST and the demands of weavers and traders have not been looked into by the GST Council. The state government also failed to take up their issues. If this issue is not sorted out, lakhs of people will be jobless, and people will start migrating from Surat to other states for work,” he said.

“The situation in the textile weaving industry is very bad in Surat city as weavers face great difficulties due to GST. There are over 6 lakh powerloom machines in Surat, and lakhs of people attached to this industry will be affected,” he added.

The Congress leader also met traders from diamond industry and listened to their grievances about 5 per cent GST on inter-state transport of diamonds and 3 per cent GST on import of unsorted rough diamonds.

Apart from meeting student leaders, Babariya met party leaders of Surat, Navsari, Valsad, Tapi and Bharuch. Party sources said that senior Congress leaders will also meet people from the NGOs in the state.

"Bayern Munich newcomers Niklas Suele, Corentin Tolisso score in season opening win","Bayern Munich comfortably beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-1 in the Bundesliga season opener on Friday. (Source: AP) Bayern Munich comfortably beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-1 in the Bundesliga season opener on Friday. (Source: AP)

Champions Bayern Munich comfortably beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-1 in the Bundesliga season opener on Friday to lay down a marker as they eye a record-extending sixth straight German league title.

Newcomers Niklas Suele and Corentin Tolisso put the Bavarians ahead before Robert Lewandowski added a third goal with a penalty, following the official use of the video assistant referee for the first time in the Bundesliga.

Bayern were missing close to half a dozen key players through injury including keeper Manuel Neuer, Thiago Alcantara and Jerome Boateng, but it never showed as they rode roughshod over Leverkusen for more than an hour at the Allianz Arena.

Admir Mehmedi pulled a goal back in the 65th minute for the visitors, who missed a handful of late chances to score again. “We have to improve our defensive work,” Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. “But I am not alarmed. We will get better.

“At this stage this can happen. If we want to have a clean sheet, we have to be more compact. We gave them at times too much space.”

Bayern could have taken the lead after five minutes when Frenchman Tolisso, the club’s record signing at 41 million euros ($48.22 million), came close to scoring on his league debut but goalkeeper Bernd Leno did well to block his low drive.

It took the hosts another five minutes to break the deadlock when Suele headed home after fellow newcomer Sebastian Rudy floated a free kick to the far post.

Midfielder Tolisso did score in the 19th minute with a close-range header from Arturo Vidal’s clever cross. Tolisso then rattled the post four minutes later with Leverkusen struggling to repel the Bayern pressure.

RAIN DELAY

The start of the second half was delayed for more than 20 minutes due to torrential rain, but seven minutes later the Bundesliga’s first ever use of the video assistant referee handed Bayern a penalty.

Poland forward Lewandowski, who had been brought down by Charles Aranguiz, converted the spot kick to grab Bayern’s third goal before Mehmedi fired in from close range.

Leverkusen finally managed to spark into life but were wasteful with their chances as Bayern stepped off the gas.

Last season’s runners-up RB Leipzig begin their title challenge at Schalke 04 on Saturday while Borussia Dortmund, who finished third, travel to VfL Wolfsburg.

"Auction of three limestone mines fetches Rs 16,201 crore; Gujarat govt to auction 9 more mines","In what is being touted as one of the biggest success stories in e-auctioning of mines in Gujarat, the state government is set to earn a whopping Rs 16,201 crore from the e-auctioning of three limestone mines in Kutch district. Officials said that this was nearly 2.5 times the revenue, the state would have earned if it had followed the traditional allotment process. Buoyed by the success of the auctioning, the government has scheduled to auction nine limestone and bauxite mines in the next six to nine months.

“Despite poor sentiments prevailing in the cement industry, we have earned a premium in the e-auctioning of three mines in Mudhvay area of Kutch district. This was the first e-auction conducted for a major mineral in the state,” Roopwant Singh, head of Commissionerate of Geology and Mining told The Sunday Express.

The three mines, put together, have a total reserve of 751 million tonne of limestone and are expected to last for 50 years. According to Singh, the government would have earned Rs 6,620 crore if the mines were allotted instead of auctioning them. “Now, the government gets additional Rs 9,581 crore as auction premium over royalty,” Singh said, adding that transparency, speed and competitiveness were some of the major advantages of the e-auctioning process.

The bids were won by Adani Cementation Ltd, JSW Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd. They together will pay Rs 324 crore annually to the state government for 50 years, which is the estimated age of the mines. “The payment of the first installment, being 10 per cent of the up-front payment, has been received from all preferred bidders,” said Singh.

Meanwhile, the government is gearing up to auction nine more mines. “These nine mines will provide the state with an estimated Rs 1,500 crore in revenues annually,” the official said.

While the bauxite mines, which will come up for e-auction, are in Dev Bhoomi Dwarka, the limestone mines are located in the districts of Gir Somnath, Kutch, Jamangar and Porbandar.

“We will also be redesigning three additional limestone blocks in Kutch and Jamnagar districts and will be putting them up for auction in the coming months,” Singh added.

Among minor minerals, the government is planning to auction 175 blocks, spread over 612 hectare, in nine district. “Apart from this, we will also be auctioning eight blocks of sand in Gandhinagar next month,” Singh added.

Gujarat produces 59 minerals, of which 38 are major and 21 minor minerals, with sizeable reserves of limestone and lignite. Gujarat has about 7,800 mining leases, of which 468 are for major minerals like limestone, lignite and bauxite that contribute up to 45 percent of the annual revenue.

Title: When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan’s Poetics

Author: Guillermo Rodriguez

Publisher: Oxford University Press

Pages: 576

Price: Rs 1195

I am always wary of being told how to read a poet. When it is a poet whose work I care for, my resistance increases. And so, it was somewhat guardedly that I picked up this book on AK Ramanujan, a writer towards whom I feel not mere admiration, but gratitude and a very real kinship.

Every writer creates his own precursors, wrote the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges. For me, AKR is a precursor for several reasons. I have long enjoyed the philosophical restlessness, the quiet self-deprecating irony, the unobtrusive rigour of his poetry. I recently revisited his translations of Nammalvar and was struck all over again by his alchemic ability to transform a 1,000-year-old poet into our contemporary — urgent, fearless, hoarse with longing and naked greed. AKR, at such times, becomes a precursor because, as translator, he uncovers for us an entire literary genealogy to which we can now claim allegiance.

More recently, on re-reading poems like ‘Fear No Fall’, that moving evocation of the Tamil saint poet Arunagiri, I have felt a growing curiosity about the intersections between AKR as poet-intellectual and as a translator of ecstatic mystical verse. These later poems seem to offer glimpses of the poet as pilgrim, one who values literary poise and precision, but yearns also for the inspired self-forgetfulness of ‘possession’.

What makes Rodriguez’s volume rewarding is the fact that he shares the wonder of discovering AKR. Drawing on scholarly essays as well as AKR’s own private journals and unpublished work, it adopts an approach that is ‘both context sensitive and reflexive’, formal and biographical, academic and introspective, allowing each category to interrogate and nourish the other. And, underlying this whole exercise, is a passionate curiosity about AKR. Through this multifocal lens, we are offered fascinating access to the mind of the poet — chronically incapable of rigidity or narrowness, hungry for places where beauty meets truth, often fractured by self-doubt, reluctant to rest content with easy victories, and always deeply, instinctively exploratory.

There is nothing schematic or critically legislative about this volume. It constantly invites the reader to look beyond pat binaries: east-west, akam-puram, interior-exterior, emotional-intellectual, insider-outsider, private-public, mother tongue-father tongue, little tradition-big tradition. Nuancing each category, it cautions us from reading AKR’s journey as that of the homesick exile, rediscovering his Indian roots in a foreign land. Instead, it reminds us of the complexity and variety of his inheritance in India, his ability to draw upon his Tamil and Kannada literary background without resorting to a chauvinist discourse, and his stout refusal to see either the Western or the Indian as monolithic categories.

‘Between’ becomes the operative word here. It signifies an awareness of the hyphen as a tremendous possibility that allows for a condition of multiple citizenship. Indeed, Ramanujan wryly described himself as “the hyphen in Indo-American studies”.

The book is liberally peppered with interesting quotes. In one, Ramanujan calls himself “a multiple monolingual”. In another: “It looks as if I live between things all the time — two (or more) languages, two countries, two disciplines.” Or, yet again: “The whole question of roots is not relevant to me… India is me and with me…” And again, ‘It takes some time before you realise that there are limits your culture has placed on you. Only they are not just limits. They are also resources.’

AKR’s image of his childhood home as a multi-tiered cultural abode (he imbibed Tamil from his mother, Sanskrit and English from his father) is significant in its refusal to posit an immutable divide between inside and outside, mother and father tongue: “[There was] a downstairs for the Tamil world, an upstairs for the English and the Sanskrit, and a terrace on top that was open to the sky… Each had a literature that was unlike the others…and it became the business of a lifetime for some of us to keep the dialogues and quarrels alive and to make something of them.”

There is no cultural machismo here — no impulse to celebrate akam over puram, foundation over terrace. Indeed, how can there be when the terrace is always open to the wilderness of sky — always challenging any snug, self-serving, static identity, aware of the tensions and ambiguities within each tradition, forever inviting us to discovery?

The ideal book on AKR, says Rodriguez, would ‘have to be written by a multidisciplinary team comprising a cultural anthropologist, a literary critic and theorist, a specialist in modern Indian poetry in English and Kannada, a Sanskritist, a Dravidian literature expert, a folklorist, a linguist, a translator and a poet’. Or, he adds, all of the above! One sees his point. It is a tall order. And yet, I suspect a vital key to understanding Ramanujan lies in seeing him foremost as a poet. It is the poet’s capacity to revel in metaphor and slippage, to distrust the rigidly ideological and doctrinaire, to doubt deeply and yet stay open to mystery, that, I imagine, made Ramanujan the inspired translator and scholar he was.

This, then, is the enduring contribution of this volume: the insight that it offers into inner workings of the mind of a remarkable writer-scholar, his capacity to remain poised between identities, to see their ruptures and continuities, without giving in to the extremes of foaming parochialism or glib internationalism. We rediscover Ramanujan as our culturally sophisticated contemporary — more fascinating and more urgently relevant to our lives than ever before. Arundhathi Subramaniam is an award-winning poet and author.

Search area expands for Army helicopter missing off Hawaii,"A Response Boat-Medium boat crew from Coast Guard Station Honolulu conducts a search for five crew members aboard a downed Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter approximately two miles west of Kaena Point, Oahu, Hawaii, Wednesday.

The US Coast Guard said Thursday it was now searching up to 50 miles (80 kilometers) off Hawaii for five soldiers missing after their Black Hawk helicopter crashed during nighttime training. Swift and dynamic currents prompted the rapid expansion. About 24 hours earlier, the search was focused on waters about 5 miles (8 kilometers) off shore. “This is normal and we have the assets, and the resources to plan for it,” Lt. Scott Carr, a spokesperson for the Coast Guard in Hawaii, said as rescuers prepared for a third night of searching.

The two pilots and three air crew members on board went missing when their helicopter lost communication with another Black Hawk at about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday. The water depth varied across the vast area. Rescue crews were only searching on the surface for the time being.

Airplanes scoured outer edges of the search zone. Helicopters and vessels were searching closer in, about 15 to 20 miles (24 to 32 kilometers) offshore. The Army, Marine Corps and Navy joined the search along with Honolulu firefighters and lifeguards. “Everyone has been resolute and determined that we are going to get after this and bring our soldiers home,” said Lt. Col. Curtis Kellogg, a spokesman for the Army’s 25th Infantry Division. “That’s what we’re focused on. And you can see it in everything they do. There’s a purpose, there’s a seriousness and there’s a determination.”

“Everyone has been resolute and determined that we are going to get after this and bring our soldiers home,” said Lt. Col. Curtis Kellogg, a spokesman for the Army’s 25th Infantry Division. “That’s what we’re focused on. And you can see it in everything they do. There’s a purpose, there’s a seriousness and there’s a determination.”

Mario Vittone, a retired Coast Guardsman and expert on sea survival, said the length of the search will depend on the likelihood of finding someone alive. In colder areas where ocean temperatures are below 60 degrees, a search would be over in 24 to 36 hours even if no one was found. But in Hawaii, where ocean temperatures are often over 75 degrees and air temperatures are also warmer, people can survive longer and searches will last longer, Vittone said.

One of the planes the Coast Guard was using, the HC-130 Hercules, has infrared technology that’s able to spot a one-degree change in temperature which will help rescuers find people in the water, Vittone said. The airplane has a screen that will overlay infrared, night vision and radar readings to give operators the best possible view of the ocean at night, he said.

On Wednesday, firefighters found and collected what appeared to be pieces of helicopter fuselage and a helmet. The two Black Hawk crews were conducting training between Kaena Point and Dillingham Airfield when communications were lost. The two helicopters are part of the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade based in Hawaii.

Early last year, 12 Marines were killed when two CH-53E helicopters collided during nighttime training off Oahu’s North Shore. A Marine Corps investigation found low aircraft readiness led to inadequate pilot proficiency. It also blamed the squadron’s lack of focus on basic aviation practices. Poor light made it difficult for crews to gauge the distance between the two aircraft, the Marine Corps said.

The Army has 2,300 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. It’s been using them since the 1970s to transport troops, lift heavy equipment and carry out other missions. In April, one crew member was killed and two others were injured when an Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed onto a golf course in Maryland during a routine training flight. In 2015, 11 crew members were killed when an Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed into the water off Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.

"Two years to World Cup, need to assign specific roles, says Virat Kohli","Virat Kohli will captain India for the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka. (Source: AP) Virat Kohli will captain India for the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka. (Source: AP)

With two years to for the ICC ODI World Cup, India need to give their players certain roles and get into the groove to understand what they need to do, captain of the Indian cricket team Virat Kohli said on Saturday. India and Sri Lanka play the first of their five one-day internationals on Sunday and Kohli believed that India doesn’t pick and choose according to the opposition they are playing.

“For us, it is about the time frame. It is not about which opposition we are playing. You can’t pick and choose. I have never believed in that and we as a team don’t believe in that,” Kohli said when asked about whether he will use players depending on the opposition.

“Two years to go for the World Cup and now is the time to give players certain roles to get into the groove and understand what we need to do,” said Kohli.

Kohli also confirmed that Test opening batsman KL Rahul will be part of the ODI playing XI and will bat at number four against Sri Lanka. This leaves Manish Pandey and Kedar Jadhav fighting for the remaining spot in the middle order.

“KL will definitely be playing in the middle-order. We are not going to be predictable or have a set pattern anymore in terms of what we are going to do in ODI or T20 cricket. Anyone could go anywhere. That’s what we are looking to do,” said the skipper.

“Someone like Manish, he has done well and has grabbed his opportunities. He has got a hundred in Australia as well, and we know about his talent and what he brings onto the field as well. He is a super fit guy and has a bright future ahead of him. So he will certainly be backed.”

“All three guys (including Kedar Jadhav) will have to compete for two spots in the middle-order. There are no guarantees I would say. As long as there is healthy competition, everyone will keep pushing each other and that is healthy for Indian cricket,” the skipper opined.

Not only Pandey but the skipper hinted that even Ajinkya Rahane has to wait as Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma will be opening while Rahane is the third opener in the side. Rahane had good series in West Indies but Kohli says Dhawan is an impact player.

“Shikhar Dhawan is an impact player. Shikhar and Rohit, we know what they have done (achieved) in the past together. We understand their potential also Jinks (Rahane’s nickname) understands that at this stage, he is the third opener in the team,” said Kohli.

“We certainly back him (Rahane) because he has been shifted around a bit in the batting order, which is not healthy for a guy, who likes to open in the shorter format. See, he grabbed his opportunities in the West Indies and he was man-of-the-series and he continues to be in the set up.

“I think he (Rahane) is much more relaxed after that West Indies series. Yes he felt the pressure before but he has overcome that now. He is enjoying his cricket,” he added.

Kohli said that with a big season coming up which includes a lot of ODIs, it is important to look to experiment and not expect an Indian victory every time.

“For us, it’s all about when you want to start giving roles to players and experimenting as a team. Sometimes we get so carried away by team India’s expectations that you have to win every game and that we don’t follow a pattern. So it’s very important to understand that as a group,” the skipper said.

“Criticism will come along the way, but we should be ready to embrace challenges and be ready to take risks and to lose a few games when you need to try out something. We are very comfortable with trying things in very different ways.

“But we need to start making the effort because 8-10 months down the line, we will be solid in our roles and what we need to do as a team,” he added. “We definitely believe in our core group – that is the only way you can reach finals of a big tournament and be consistent as an ODI side. But if you want to be world-beaters and win everywhere in the world, you need to do certain things that are out of the box as well. So we’re all ready to embrace that,” skipper explained.

“I don’t see having three spinners on this track. I have played here in the past. It is probably a three-fast bowler kind of a pitch, where Hardik Pandya is good enough to give us 7-8 overs. So I see only two guys (spinners) taking the field.”

“Now who are those two going to be really depends on what we feel like going in with as a team but having wrist spinners (chinaman Kuldeep Yadav and leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal) in the team is always an advantage. If you look at teams across the world, they have at least one wrist spinner, if not two in their side, giving breakthroughs in the middle overs, which is very important. So all three are very skilled (including Axar Patel) but only two can take the field which we haven’t decided as of now. But we should be clear by tomorrow morning,” Kohli said.

Decoded: Why whisky tastes better with water,"Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Adding a few drops of water enhances the taste of whisky, say scientists who confirm what alcohol connoisseurs have long known. Researchers at Linnaeus University in Sweden have found that adding water to whisky alters the drink’s molecules to make it taste better. Whisky is a chemically complicated beverage. After malting, mashing, fermentation, distillation and maturing, for at least three years in oak barrels, it is bottled.

However, first whisky is usually diluted to around 40 per cent of alcohol by volume by the addition of water, which changes the taste significantly. Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky. “The taste of whisky is primarily linked to so-called amphipathic molecules, which are made up of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts,” said Bjorn Karlsson, chemistry researcher at Linnaeus University.

“One such molecule is guaiacol, a substance that develops when the grain is dried over peat smoke when making malt whisky, providing the smoky flavour to the whisky,” Karlsson said.

Researchers carried out computer simulations of water/ethanol mixtures in the presence of guaiacol to study its interactions. They found that guaiacol was preferentially associated with ethanol molecules and that in mixtures with concentrations of ethanol up to 45 per cent guaiacol was more likely to be present at the liquid-air interface than in the bulk of the liquid.

“This suggests that, in a glass of whisky, guaiacol will therefore be found near the surface of the liquid, where it contributes to both the smell and taste of the spirit,” said Ran Friedman, researcher in chemistry at Linnaeus University. “Interestingly, a continued dilution down to 27 per cent resulted in an increase of guaiacol at the liquid-air interface.

“An increased percentage, over 59 per cent, had the opposite effect, that is to say, the ethanol interacted more strongly with the guaiacol, driving the molecule into the solution away from the surface,” Friedman said. These findings suggest that the taste and aroma of guaiacol, and similar compounds in whisky, are enhanced when the spirit is diluted prior to bottling and this taste may be more pronounced on further dilution in the glass.

“How we experience taste and aroma is highly individual. Some people choose to add ice cubes to their whisky, to cool it down and give it a milder taste. Thus, there is no general answer to how much water you should add to your whisky to get the best taste experience,” Karlsson added. The research was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

IIT Kharagpur accepts resignation of whistle-blower professor who got relief from former president,"The institute set up a probe panel that found him guilty. In 2014, the IIT decided to hand him compulsory retirement. The institute set up a probe panel that found him guilty. In 2014, the IIT decided to hand him compulsory retirement.

IIT Kharagpur, has accepted the resignation of whistle-blower professor, Rajeev Kumar, whose compulsory retirement penalty was quashed by former president Pranab Mukherjee, days before he demitted office. IIT Kharagpur had suspended Kumar for “misconduct” in May 2011, the same year the Supreme Court had lauded him as an “unsung hero” for his efforts to reform the IIT Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), which has since been re-christened as JEE Advanced.

The institute set up a probe panel that found him guilty. In 2014, the IIT decided to hand him compulsory retirement. Kumar, who alleged that the panel was biased, moved the Delhi High Court and obtained a stay on the IIT’s decision. He also appealed to the then president requesting that the decision be quashed. While he had resigned in 2014 only, the institution had not accepted his resignation saying the matter was sub-judice.

“Former president and Visitor of IIT Kharagpur has set aside the penalty of compulsory retirement on professor Rajeev Kumar…the institute accepts his technical resignation in view of the HRD communication following presidential order,” an official memorandum said. Following the high court’s stay order, Kumar had taken lien for two years and joined Jawaharlal Nehru University in 2015. However, he was relieved from JNU in June so he can join back at IIT Kharagpur.

The professor has appealed to JNU Vice Chancellor to reinstate him as his penalty has been quashed and resignation accepted. The JNU Vice Chancellor, when contacted, did not comment on the issue. Days before he demitted office last month, Mukherjee had ordered setting aside of the penalty imposed on Kumar. The HRD Ministry had last week issued orders to the IIT Kharagpur director to comply with Mukherjee’s decision.

Kumar was accused of “damaging the reputation of the institute” by levelling allegations on issues ranging from irregularities in the purchase of laptops to rampant copying by students during examinations.

‘Education system should be so strong that no child fails’,"Debates on the education policy should not become political controversies, Peshin said. (Representational Image) Debates on the education policy should not become political controversies, Peshin said. (Representational Image)

THE EDUCATION system should be so strong that no child fails, a top official of the DAV schools said on Saturday. Dr Nisha Peshin, (Director PS II) Director-Academics, DAV CMC, New Delhi, was here in the city to inaugurate the two-day Hansraj Parliamentary Debate Championship, in which 30 teams from schools across the Tricity took part.

“Instead of creating a controversy over detention/no detention, all stakeholders in the education system should focus on framing the right policy keeping in mind the well-being of each child. Two extremes are always wrong. So, we need to have from Class I measures to help the child develop the right educational base so that he never fails. The educational stakeholders should focus more on the preventive measures ensuring that the education system is so strong that there is no need for such a policy,” she said.

Debates on the education policy should not become political controversies, Peshin said. “Right now, every school is giving knowledge to the students but many are still missing as how to ensure a student should apply the gained knowledge in the right manner.”

Sharing her views on the issue of subscribing to NCERT books at all CBSE-affiliated schools, she said the issue raised by NCERT is right to some extent as there in no doubt that at many places, publishers of private books are doing commercialisation and because of which the students are getting sub-standard reading material.

“We have to understand that whatever NCERT or CBSE is saying, we at DAV are also saying the same thing. We also say that commercialisation done by the private publisher is wrong but at the same time, we also ensure that the students get dynamic set of books which are revised every year, which is certainly missing in the case of the NCERT books,” said Peshin.

A majority of Americans say that the US should not threaten the North Korea with military action, according to a new poll. Nearly six in ten Americans say that the US should not threaten North Korea with military action, while 33 per cent say that military threats should be issued toward North Korea, said the CBS News poll.

Opinions differ largely by party, the poll also found, with 82 per cent Democrats saying the US should not and 63 per cent of Republicans saying the US should threaten with military action, Xinhua news agency reported.

However, if the US fails in its effort to solve North Korea nuclear issue diplomatically, 58 per cent of Americans say that they would approve of military action against North Korea.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reaffirmed on Thursday that diplomatic effort was “first and foremost” choice in solving the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.

“In cooperation with other nations, we will continue to employ diplomatic and economic pressure to convince North Korea to end its illegal nuclear and ballistic missile program,” said Tillerson here at a joint press conference with visiting Japanese officials.

“We continue our full-out efforts, working with partners, working with allies to bring that pressure,” he added.

However, Tillerson warned that though not “our preferred pathway,” the US is “prepared militarily… with our allies to respondent, if that is necessary”.

"Manchester United under no pressure to complete fourth signing, says Jose Mourinho","Jose Mourinho feels that Manchester United’s spot in the Champions League marked the most important thing for him last season. (Source: AP) Jose Mourinho feels that Manchester United’s spot in the Champions League marked the most important thing for him last season. (Source: AP)

Manchester United are satisfied with their transfer business and under no pressure to sign a fourth player in the current window, manager Jose Mourinho said.

Last week, Mourinho said United were looking to sign a winger after signing three of his four transfer targets – defender Victor Lindelof, midfielder Nemanja Matic and striker Romelu Lukaku – but has since said he is content with the squad.

“Unless something happens that puts us in the market again. Obviously, my plans were four but I also told (club Executive Vice Chairman) Ed Woodward, ‘No pressure from me, do what you think is best for the club’,” Mourinho told reporters on Friday.

“I am happy with the squad we have. I’m ready to go without a fourth signing. My club did phenomenally well. I had four targets, we got three before first match. My club did great work. Also nobody is in doubt (about their future).”

Mourinho believes United must raise their game, like they did under former manager Alex Ferguson in previous years, to challenge for the Premier League title this season.

“When I won two consecutive titles with Chelsea, the United manager (Ferguson) said we brought the bar to a certain level,” Mourinho said. “And that they had to improve a lot to try to win the trophy back.

“I think this happens every season. Somebody wins and the others are not happy. They don’t accept it with their hands in their pockets and the others improve to try to be better.”

The Portuguese boss said injured defenders Luke Shaw and Ashley Young were close to returning and would play for the club’s under-23 team on Monday.

United, who opened their league season with a 4-0 win over West Ham United last Sunday, face Swansea City this weekend.

Neeraj Chopra’s World Athletics Championships memory: Jan Zelezny sighting,"Neeraj Chopra could not improve on his season best of 85.63 at the World Championships in London and did not make the final. File Neeraj Chopra could not improve on his season best of 85.63 at the World Championships in London and did not make the final. File

His throws weren’t quite memorable but that doesn’t mean javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra is likely to forget the World Athletics Championship at London any time soon. For the 19-year-old the biggest takeaway from the England trip was a chance to witness the training session of the Czech Republic javelin team. More specifically, standing transfixed watching legendary javelin thrower Jan Železný train his proteges Jakub Vadlejch and Petr Frydrych.

Considering he was without a coach in London, Chopra would have loved to interact with the all-time great and the world record holder but he kept a distance, taking mental notes that he would refer to when training.

After his Asian Athletics Championships gold, Chopra was expected to make an impact at the Worlds. That was not be as he failed to qualify for the final. Looking back, Chopra can put a finger on his flaws. “Speed during the approach run was an issue. I felt I was lacking speed and I was not in rhythm. I don’t know why I have lost some of my speed, but I need to figure out if I need to rework my technique. Nothing went right for me. I just could not throw to my potential,” says the teenager who registered a best throw of 82.36 metres during qualification. His second throw was a foul and the third 80.54.

Two days later, Chopra watched from the stands as Germany’s Johannes Vetter won gold (89.89m) . He also witnessed one of the all-time greats Mo Farah run his last race on the track, the 5000 metres, and finish second. “The world championships is the highest level of competition. There was a lot of expectations from me. I know people thought that since he has won a gold at the junior world championships, he will win a medal at the senior world championships. It does not work like that. I worked as hard as I possibly could but the effort I put in didn’t translate into success. But I am still young and the experience will hold me in good stead. There is a world of a difference if you compare junior and senior competition. Some of the throwers in the field had over a decade of experience.”

Chopra is back at the National Institute of Sports in Patiala and is looking forward to the Diamond League Finals in Zurich next week. He will once again have to manage without the expertise of a coach and will have to fallback on videos shot on his mobile phone to analyse his technique and find ways to iron out technical flaws.

“Technique is everything in javelin throw. You may have the power, but if your technique is awry then it can even result in injuries. Having a coach will be beneficial because there is an expert with you who can tell you what you are doing wrong, what you need to focus on and how you should plan your schedule. Currently, I am asking senior throwers for advice or figuring it out myself.”

Last month at the Asian Athletics Championships in Bhubaneshwar, Chopra, after starting with a foul and following it up with two 78-metre throws, didn’t seem like a medal contender. Yet he fed off the home crowd to produce his best throw of the evening in his final attempt — 85.23m — to win gold at the continental championships.

“Hopefully, there will be many more occasions when I will be at the top of the podium at a senior championships. In London, I didn’t fulfil my potential but I am confident that my fortune will change soon. Rest assured it is not because of lack of effort on my part.”

Bihar’s Srijan Scandal part II: At heart of Srijan scam is rise and rise of its founder,"Manorama Devi’s house at Vikramshila Colony in Bhagalpur. EXPRESS PHOTO BY Santosh Singh Manorama Devi’s house at Vikramshila Colony in Bhagalpur. EXPRESS PHOTO BY Santosh Singh

FROM TWO sewing machines in a one-room rented house in Bhagalpur 20 years ago to an influential cooperative society with over 6,000 members, 60 staff and office premises spread over 24,000 sq ft on government land.

The rise of Manorama Devi, founder of Srijan Mahila Sahyog Samiti Ltd, since 1996 was nothing short of spectacular. On February 13, Devi died of illness at the age of 65 and her organisation is now in the dock for allegedly conniving with government officials and bank employees to siphon off Rs 700 crore of welfare funds by fudging records over the last 10 years.

On Thursday, the Bihar government ordered a CBI probe into the scam, following nine FIRs and 12 arrests registered by state police in the case. But an investigation by The Indian Express shows that at the heart of the scam is the tale of its founder itself, who operated right under the government’s nose, sharing the stage with ministers and flaunting her links to senior bureaucrats, businessmen and politicians.

So much so, that she came to be known as “Srijan Didi”.

Today, Devi’s daughter-in-law Priya Kumar who took over Srijan this year, is on the run, along with her husband Amit Kumar, who runs a finance coaching centre in Bhagalpur.

“Now we know the reason behind her growth. We used to wonder how an organisation selling incense sticks, bindis and pickles could make people so rich,” said a resident of Vikramshila Colony in Bhagalpur’s Sabour town, the site of Devi’s four-storey mansion. District officials say that when Devi fell ill in 2016, an air ambulance was called to Bhagalpur to take her to Delhi for treatment.

According to police records, Devi’s journey started in 1996 when, as an undergraduate, she set up Srijan to empower women. Officials say she “meticulously” worked on the “symbol of women empowerment”, riding the boost given by Nitish Kumar’s NDA government of 2006 to self-help groups across the state.

Police officers now suspect that Srijan’s official list of activities, such as preparing sattu (roasted gram), bindis, incense sticks, pickles and spices, could have been a cover. They say they are investigating charges that the cooperative society enrolled the relatives of bureaucrats as members, giving them “heavy loans”, far above the limit of Rs 50,000.

Police records show that one such case being probed is that of a loan of Rs 8 lakh allegedly given to the wife of an IAS officer “for buying a Harley Davidson motorcycle”.

”All the big businessmen in Bhagalpur would be at the beck and call of Manorama Devi. But no one sought to know how the head of an organisation with an annual turnover of less than Rs 1.5 crore could command such respect and awe,” said police sources linked to the investigation.

”I have seen at least three senior officials touch her feet to show their respect,” said a resident of Sabour.

How 2003 marked turning point

Devi hails from an upper caste Kayasth family at Navgachhia in Bhagalpur and moved to Sabour after the death in 1991 of her husband, Awadhesh Kumar, a principal scientist at the Indian Lac Research Institute in Ranchi, which is now known as the Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums. Her father was a former principal of Sabour Agriculture College.

Police sources say Devi took on the responsibility of her three sons and two daughters and started a stitching centre for women with two employees. Soon, they say, she tied up with a local doctor’s wife to expand her network, borrowed Rs 40,000 “from the market” and started selling handicrafts, salwar suits and saris.

The year 2003 was crucial for Devi, say police sources. That was when K P Ramaiah took charge as the District Magistrate of Bhagalpur and launched several schemes to promote cooperative initiatives. “Citing a government scheme, the DM announced a subsidy of 50 per cent for purchasing sewing machines. Srijan purchased 1,000 machines from a vendor, who now runs one of the biggest electronic showrooms in Bhagalpur. These machines were given to 1,000 women, who were enrolled as members. This was how Manorama Devi became a known face here,” said an official posted at the Bhagalpur DM’s office.

”Later, she cultivated links with bureaucrats banking on her image as a rising entrepreneur working to uplift women. In 2005, she started a cooperative bank, which was not affiliated to the Central Cooperative Bank of Bhagalpur. The district administration opened branches of the CCB in all blocks of Bhagalpur, except Sabour,” said police sources.

Sources close to the Srijan management say Devi’s influence started spreading rapidly after the bank was set up.

”At the time, Sabour had only one nationalised bank and people started flocking to Srijan without knowing that it was not a full-fledged bank. In 2006, an official from the state cooperative department arrived for an inspection but Devi got him to talk to a senior official and the matter came to rest. By 2007, she had started giving heavy loans to the market at an interest rate of 16 per cent,” said sources close to the Srijan management.

One case that police sources point to is that of local BJP leader Bipin Sharma, who was sacked as the party’s state vice-president after he came under the scanner for his alleged proximity to Devi. “He started off as the owner of a small shop but now owns five showrooms of branded footwear and clothes in Bhagalpur,” they said. Sharma was not available for comment.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Bhagalpur SSP Manoj Kumar said, “One startling revelation that has emerged during investigations is that government money under different heads would be directly deposited with Srijan in outright violation of banking norms. This was discontinued after the DM issued an order in 2008 to deposit government funds in nationalised banks. By then, we suspect, Srijan could have accumulated a lot of money in interest.”

More officials could face heat

Another police officer linked to the investigation said several senior officials in the state “could face the heat” once the CBI begins its probe.

“We suspect that Devi invested a lot of money in real estate and other businesses through conduits and dummies. This is hard to establish, which why the district police may not have been able to take the investigation beyond a point,” said the officer.

The Indian Express had reported on Saturday that the key to the scam were two methods: direct deposit of government funds to Srijan’s accounts through fake third-party endorsement and via duplicate cheques with forged signatures.

“Let the forensic department examine the signatures of some of the DMs on these cheques. We suspect some of them would turn out to be genuine. But it is now up to CBI to take the investigation further,” said the officer.

On Saturday, Bhagalpur police detained three persons — former district cooperative officer Pankaj Jha, former central cooperative bank manager Sudhanshu Kumar Das and bank staffer Vijay Kumar Gupta for allegedly transferring Rs 48 crore from the cooperative department’s fund to Srijan. “We have detained them for questioning. If we are not satisfied with their answers, they could be arrested,” said SSP Kumar.

Apart from daughter-in-law Priya, whose father is Jharkhand Congress’s vice president Anandi Brahma, and her husband Amit, police sources say Srijan was being run by a chartered accountant P K Ghosh, auditor Satish Chandra Jha, who has been arrested, and staffer Bansidhar Jha. Devi’s second son Pranav Kumar is a doctor in Australia — a third son died in an accident a few years ago – and her two daughters are married.

According to former employees of Srijan, Devi had once claimed that she decided to name her organisation “Srijan” after meeting victims of the communal riots of 1989 at Chanderi village in Bhagalpur. At the time, Devi is said to have declared: “After all, Srijan (creation) takes place after pralay (destruction).”

US: President’s arts council quits over Donald Trump’s Charlottesville remarks,"US President Donald Trump. (Reuters/Files) US President Donald Trump. (Reuters/Files)

The members of the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities (PCAH), an advisory committee to the White House on cultural issues, have resigned citing the controversial comments made by US President Donald Trump about the racist violence in Virginia. In a letter dated yesterday, and signed by 16 of 17 committee members including two Indian-Americans Jhumpa Lahiri and Kal Penn, Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change has also been cited as a reason for their resignation.

“Supremacy, discrimination, and vitriol are not American values. Your values are not American values. We must be better than this. We are better than this. If this is not clear to you, then we call on you to resign your office, too,” said members of the presidential advisory committee who resigned yesterday.

Trump had commented about last weekend’s “Unite the Right” gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia. He has blamed “many sides” for the demonstrations that left an anti-racism activist dead. All the members who resigned were appointed by Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama.

The White House in a statement said Trump had already decided not to renew the executive order for the PCAH, which expires later this year. “While the committee has done good work in the past, in its current form it simply is not a responsible way to spend American tax dollars. The PCAH merely redirects funding from the federal cultural agencies that answer directly to the President, Congress and taxpayers. These cultural agencies do tremendous work and they will continue to engage in these important projects,” it said.

In its letter, members of the presidential committee said reproach and censure in the strongest possible terms are necessary following Trump’s “support of the hate groups and terrorists who killed and injured fellow Americans in Charlottesville.” “The false equivalencies you push cannot stand,” said the letter released to the press. “Elevating any group that threatens and discriminates on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, disability, orientation, background, or identity is un-American. We have fought slavery, segregation, and internment. We must learn from our rich and often painful history,” the members said in the letter.

Noting that art is about inclusion and the humanities include a vibrant free press, the members alleged that Trump had attacked both. “You released a budget which eliminates arts and culture agencies. You have threatened nuclear war while gutting diplomacy funding. The administration pulled out of the Paris agreement, filed an amicus brief undermining the Civil Rights Act, and attacked our brave trans service members. You have subverted equal protections, and are committed to banning Muslims and refugee women & children from our great country,” they said.

Underscoring the importance of open and free dialogue, the members said the actions and words of the president are pushing further away from the freedoms they are entitled to. “This does not unify the nation we all love. We know the importance of open and free dialogue through our work in the cultural diplomacy realm, most recently with the first-ever US Government arts and culture delegation to Cuba, a country without the same First Amendment protections we enjoy here. Your words and actions push us all further away from the freedoms we are guaranteed.

“Ignoring your hateful rhetoric would have made us complicit in your words and actions. We took a patriotic oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic,” the members wrote in the letter.

Earlier this week, two business advisory councils were disbanded as members left in protest. Among others who resigned were Paula Boggs, Chuck Close, Richard Cohen, Fred Goldring, Howard L Gottlieb, Vicki Kennedy, Anne Luzzatto, Thom Mayne, Eric Ortner, Ken Solomon, Caroline Taylor, Jill Cooper Udall, Andrew Weinstein, George Wolfe and John Lloyd Young.

"Floyd Mayweather aka ‘Mr Money’ talks up legacy, record","Floyd Mayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime. (Source: AP) Floyd Mayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime. (Source: AP)

Floyd Mayweather has a fight on his hands. A week out from the boxing match against UFC superstar and non-boxer Conor McGregor, the five-division world champion is busy trying to convince everybody of the high stakes involved. “You know, I have the 49-0 record. And when a fighter has lost before, if he loses again they say, ‘Oh, it’s nothing. He lost before’,” Mayweather said during a conference call on Friday, referring to the Irishman’s 21-3 MMA record. “But when a fighter has been dominating for 20-something years and never lost, everything is on the line — my legacy, my boxing record, everything is on the line. I truly believe I’m taking the bigger risk. There’s a big reward for both, but I’m taking the bigger risk.”

There is a big reward, that much is accurate. The showdown in Las Vegas looks set to surpass the record Rs. 3,982 crore generated by Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in 2015. The basic purse for McGregor and Mayweather is Rs. 511 crore and Rs. 642 crore respectively. With the pay-per-view priced at Rs. 6,400, both have left no stone unturned in trying to maximise their shares through a merciless promotional campaign.

A four-day, four-city media tour, two loudmouthed combatants and countless publicity stunts have managed to generate interest, but slow ticket sales mean scepticism remains over the competitive nature of the freakshow. Both McGregor and Mayweather are trying to dissuade just that and lend some sort of legitimacy to the contest. McGregor’s camp has resorted to releasing flattering sparring footage and drumming up the Irishman’s infamous left hand. Mayweather Sr conversely has talked about a “hand problem” plaguing Floyd, and the 40-year-old son admits he hasn’t been as sharp in training.

“I’m not the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago. Of course not,” he said. “I don’t think that I’m the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 10 years ago. I’m, not even the same Floyd Mayweather that I was I was five or two years ago.” At one point, earlier this week, the usually brash Mayweather seemed to be betting on his opponent. “He’s a lot younger. When you look at myself and Conor McGregor on paper, he’s (an inch) taller, has a longer reach, he’s a bigger man from top to bottom. He’s a lot younger, so youth is on his side,” he said of the 29-year-old. “And I’ve been off a couple of years. And I’m in my 40s. So, if you look at everything on paper, it leans toward Conor McGregor.”

At least on Friday, Mayweather believed the fight now leans back towards him. “…I still have a high IQ in that ring. And experience wise, it leans towards me, period, because I have been in the ring at such a high level for so long.” Twenty-one years, to be exact. Since the knockout win on debut against Roberto Apodaca, Mayweather has amassed a 49-0 record, one short of heavyweight legend Rocky Marciano’s flawless 50-0. Veteran promoter Bob Arum has said that “Floyd doesn’t deserve the 50-0 record, because he is not fighting a real boxer.”

Mayweather though isn’t thinking that far ahead. “I am putting a 21-year, 49-0 career on line. But I try not to think about losing or taking the ‘L.’ Each boxer I beat paved way for this record. But that is not my focus. 50-0… Rocky Marciano did it his way. Floyd Mayweather will do it his.” 50-0 or (highly improbable) 49-1, Mayweather though insists that he won’t be coming out of retirement again. “I gave my word to (manager) Al Haymon. I gave my word to my children. And one thing I don’t want to do is break that. This will be my last fight.”

US State Department email restored after worldwide outage,"State Department email service has been restored after a nearly 12-hour worldwide outage hit its entire unclassified system. Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said service resumed slowly shortly after midday Friday and was expected to be completely restored by late afternoon.

The outage began around 2 am Friday morning and officials said it was not caused by human error and not “any external action or interference.”

The department was forced to shut down its unclassified email systems in 2014 in what officials said at the time was routine maintenance. But it later emerged that the system had been compromised by hackers believed to be affiliated with Russia and that the maintenance explanation was a cover story.

Need to stop ‘radical Islamic terrorism’: Donald Trump,"US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

US President Donald Trump on Friday called for strong measures to combat “radical Islamic terrorism”, a day after twin terror attacks killed 14 people and injured around 100 others in Spain. A van driver on Thursday ploughed into pedestrians on Barcelona’s most popular street in broad daylight, killing at least 14 people.

The Islamic State terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Police later shot dead five suspects after a second vehicle attack in the coastal town of Cambrils, around 130 kilometres from Barcelona. “Radical Islamic Terrorism must be stopped by whatever means necessary! The courts must give us back our protective rights. Have to be tough!” Trump said in a tweet.

In another tweet, Trump said the US security forces and law enforcement agencies were on guard and were monitoring the situation. “Homeland Security and law enforcement are on alert & closely watching for any sign of trouble. Our borders are far tougher than ever before!” he said. Trump accused the Opposition Democratic party of being “obstructionists” and compromising with security of the country. “The Obstructionist Democrats make Security for our country very difficult. They use the courts and associated delay at all times. Must stop!” he tweeted.

Sadio Mane strikes as Liverpool scrape 1-0 win over Crystal Palace,"Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 1-0. (Source: Reuters) Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 1-0. (Source: Reuters)

Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp was able to breathe a sigh of relief after Sadio Mane scored an opportunist goal to give them a 1-0 Premier League win over Crystal Palace at Anfield on Saturday.

The Senegalese winger took advantage of a mistake by Palace midfielder Luka Milivojevic and steered the ball past Wayne Hennessey in the 73rd minute, prompting Klopp to praise the home side’s persistence.

“It was a hard job,” the German told Sky Sports.

“We had moments in the first half but had to be more patient because they were deep. “(In the) Second half we did it better. We were really awake and defended well and I loved the goal because it was not a clear situation. “We had other chances but I am completely happy with how we did the job today. Anfield helps a lot, I think today it was the difference.”

Still missing forward Philippe Coutinho through a back injury, after Liverpool reportedly turned down a third offer from Barcelona for the Brazilian playmaker on Friday, the hosts struggled to break down a stubborn Palace.

Wary after conceding three soft goals in their opening day 3-3 draw at Watford, Liverpool were reluctant to take too many risks in a tepid first half devoid of goalmouth action.

The hosts had 72 percent possession and took 23 shots at goal against Palace’s four. But the visitors missed the best chance of the match shortly after the break as former

Liverpool striker Christian Benteke blazed a shot over the bar from six yards out.

With the Anfield faithful roaring them on, Liverpool broke the deadlock when Milivojevic failed to clear the ball and Mane pounced to beat Hennessey, who did well to deny substitutes Dominic Solanke and Mohamed Salah in the closing stages.

Liverpool fielded a revamped back four with left back Andrew Robertson enjoying an impressive Premier League debut, having made several darting runs on his flank while also doing some good defensive work.

“Before the game he (Klopp) said go and play your normal game and there was bit more space down the left than the right in the first half,” said the 23-year old Glaswegian, who joined Liverpool from relegated Hull City during the close season.

“It is brilliant to be here.”

Australia’s Jason Norris wins Fiji International,"Australian Jason Norris claimed his biggest career victory Sunday when he shot a 5-under 67 to win the Fiji International by four shots.

The 44-year-old from South Australia began the final round a shot behind countryman Wade Ormsby and carded eight birdies and three bogeys to finish out in front with a four round total of 274, 14-under par.

“I think it was just our week,” said Norris. “Everything aligned and putts dropped and some good shots came, it was amazing.”

Thailand’s Jazz Janewattanond drained a 66-foot eagle putt to set a course-record of 8-under 64 and finish in a three-way tie for second at 10-under with Australians David McKenzie and James Marchesani.

The overnight leader Wade Ormsby closed with a 73 to tie for fifth with Adam Bland (65), New Zealand’s Daniel Pearce (69), and Peter Wilson (70), five shots behind Norris.

The tournament, which is co-sanctioned by the Australasian PGA and the European and Asian Tours, featured three Masters champions.

Canada’s Mike Weir finished with a 74, in a tie for 35th at 2-under, while hometown favorite Vijay Singh (71) and Argentina’s Angel Cabrera (74) were tied for 41st at 1-under.

Norris won three smaller events on the Australasian Tour between 2007 and 2010 but almost gave up the sport when he contracted meningitis in 2013.

“I said a couple of years ago when I was about to quit that I didn’t want to give it away until I had won a big tournament because I know I can,” Norris said.

“I just tried to stay switched on and not think about the future, things come into your head, you try to block them out. I was really happy with our process today.”

(Lehtikuva via AP)

Finnish police are investigating Friday’s knife attacks that killed two and wounded eight in the city of Turku as terrorism-related crimes, they said on Saturday. The suspect arrested on Friday was an 18-year-old Moroccan, police said, adding that the two people killed were Finns and an Italian and two Swedish citizens were among the injured.

The attacks shocked the Nordic country where violent crime is relatively rare and which has been named as the world’s safest place to visit by the World Economic Forum. Following the attacks on Friday, police shot the suspected attacker in the leg and arrested him. “Due to information received during the night, the Turku stabbings are now being investigated as murders with terrorist intent,” the National Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.

Security was reinforced nationwide with increased patrols and more surveillance in case more people were involved. “First thing we heard was a young woman, screaming like crazy. I thought it’s just kids having fun … but then people started to move around and I saw a man with a knife in his hand, stabbing a woman,” said Laura Laine, who was sitting in a cafe during one of the attacks.

“Then a person ran towards us shouting ‘he has a knife’, and everybody from the terrace ran inside. Next, a woman came in to the cafe. She was crying hysterically, down on her knees, saying someone’s neck has been slashed open.” The police arrested a number of people during the night as part of their investigation.

Local media said the police raided an apartment in the eastern Turku suburb of Varissuo, which is home to a large immigrant population and located about 7 kilometers from the market square where the attack took place. The arrested suspect had been in Finland for only a short time before the attack, Helsingin Sanomat newspaper reported. The police will hold a news conference at 1100 GMT.

Four of the wounded were still in hospital, three of them in intensive care, while the other injured persons would be sent home on Saturday, the hospital said. Flags were at half mast on Saturday across the Nordic country whose Security Intelligence Service (SIS) raised the terrorism threat level in June to ‘elevated’ from ‘low’, saying it had become aware of terrorism-related plans in Finland.

Leaders of Turku’s Iraqi and Syrian community condemned the attacks and said they would hold a rally of solidarity in the city’s main square. An anti-immigration group was planning a demonstration in Helsinki. The SIS has said anti-immigration groups have been on the rise in the country after it received about 32,500 asylum seekers during the migration crisis in 2015.

“Terrorists want to pit people against each other. We will not let this happen. Finnish society will not be defeated by fear or hatred,” Interior Minister Paula Risikko said on Twitter. On Thursday, a suspected Islamist militant drove a van into crowds in Barcelona, Spain, killing 13 people and wounding scores of others.

Barcelona terror attack: California man celebrating marriage anniversary killed in Las Ramblas attack,"Dan Tucker, father of Jared Tucker who was killed in the Barcelona truck attack. (Source: AP Photo) Dan Tucker, father of Jared Tucker who was killed in the Barcelona truck attack. (Source: AP Photo)

California resident Jared Tucker and his new bride had just sent joyful pictures from their first trip to Europe, a vacation they’d saved for to celebrate their 1-year anniversary. The last pictures arrived a day before tragedy struck. Tucker’s family in Northern California learned Friday that he was among those killed in a deadly truck attack a day earlier in Barcelona, Spain, becoming the only known American fatality among 14 victims. Tucker’s father, Dan Tucker, stood outside his home in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Walnut Creek, scrolling through pictures on his phone in disbelief.

One showed Jared frolicking in the ocean at a Barcelona beach, his arms raised above his head. Another shows Jared in sunglasses pretending to ride a statue of a lion. “That’s him just having a ball,” his father said, choking up as he looked at the pictures. “Everybody is just shocked. What are the chances? That one person in the whole United States is the victim of terrorists and it’s Jared.” Jared, 42, worked with his father in a family business remodeling swimming pools. He had “a magnetic personality and people loved him,” his dad said. He liked to fish, play golf and other sports and he was deeply in love with his wife, Heidi-Nunes-Tucker, 40, a schoolteacher, his father said.

Betty Needham, who works at one of the companies Daniel Tucker owns, said she’s known the younger Tucker for years. “Once you meet him, you’d never forget him. He’s always got a smile on his face. He’s got a big smile and a big heart,” she said. “It’s a big loss here for us. He’s leaving a big hole here.” Jared’s sister, Tina Luke, told The Associated Press that Tucker and his wife had married a year ago and were celebrating their anniversary after having saved up for the trip. They spent about four days in Paris and were to have stayed in Barcelona another four days with plans to return home on Saturday, his father said. Nunes-Tucker told NBC News that the couple was having drinks at a patio in Barcelona on Thursday when her husband said he was going to the bathroom. “Next thing I know, there’s screaming, yelling,” she said. “I got pushed inside the souvenir kiosk and stayed there hiding while everybody kept running by screaming.” Nunes-Tucker was notified by the U.S. Consulate which first showed her pictures of the victims and then took her to see his body, Tucker’s father said. The couple lived in Lafayette, the town next to his parents, where friends gathered outside the home. A neighbor, Diana Gray, described them as a “very happy, loving” couple.

Jared’s father said he had been through a broken marriage and tough times but he was so happy lately. “I’ve not seen him happier than he’s been this last year,” his father said softly. “The last week has probably been some of the happiest time of his life. That’s the only consoling part _ that he probably died happy,” Dan Tucker said. The State Department confirmed earlier Friday that at least one American was killed and one injured in the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils, Spain.

In remarks to State Department staff on Friday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed the death and expressed condolences to the victim’s family. He said diplomats from the U.S. consulate in Barcelona are working with local authorities to identify victims and provide assistance to other Americans in need. Jared Tucker leaves behind three daughters, his sister said in a message posted on a fundraising website. “Pray for Jared and his family, pray for Barcelona, but most importantly pray that we can someday rid ourselves of the hate that takes our loved ones before their time,” she wrote.

IIT JEE entrance exam to be conducted online from next year,"Earlier this year, the Ministry of Human Resource Development notified two major changes in the JEE pattern for 2017. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Human Resource Development notified two major changes in the JEE pattern for 2017.

The IIT entrance exam will go completely online from next year, according to a member of the IIT Joint Admission Board. The JAB, which is the policy-making body on IIT admissions, took the decision at a meeting in Chennai.

In a statement, Director, IIT-Madras, and Chairman JAB 2017, Prof Bhaskar Ramamurthi said, “It has been decided that the JEE (Advanced) will be conducted in online mode from 2018 onwards. Further information regarding the examination will be provided by the JAB in due course.”

The HRD Ministry had earlier introduced the option of taking the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)- Mains online.

The JEE-Mains is the entrance examination for admission to engineering courses offered across the country and a qualifying exam for JEE-Advanced which is required for admission to the prestigious IITs and NITs.

“In order to make logistics and evaluations easier it was decided today that the JEE-Advanced should be made online,” a JAB member said. “The concept was being discussed for many years, but it was necessary to have adequate infrastructure to conduct the exam online,” the member added.

More than 13 lakh students took the JEE-Mains this year, with less than 10 per cent of them going online. Around 2.2 lakh students were eligible to write the JEE (Advanced).

For admission engineering in 23 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), students have to appear for the Joint Entrance Examination – Advanced (JEE – Advanced). It is the sole admission test for the IITs.

Earlier this year, the Ministry of Human Resource Development notified two major changes in the JEE pattern for 2017. Firstly, there shall be no weightage for the 12th class marks in calculating the ranks in the JEE (Main) examination. Secondly, for the candidates to qualify for the admission in the IITs/NITs/IIITs and such other CFTIs whose admissions are based on the JEE (Advanced)/JEE(Main) ranks, they should have secured at least 75% marks in the 12th class examination, or be in the top 20 percentile in the 12th class examination conducted by the respective Boards.

For SC/ST students the qualifying marks would be 65% in the 12th class examination.

"Fighting spirit will keep us up, says Newcastle United’s Jamaal Lascelles","Jamaal Lascelles joined Newcastle United from Nottingham Forest in 2014. (Source: Reuters) Jamaal Lascelles joined Newcastle United from Nottingham Forest in 2014. (Source: Reuters)

Newcastle United captain Jamaal Lascelles believes the players’ never-say-die attitude will ensure the team’s survival in the Premier League this season.

Although the promoted Tyneside club are likely to be among the candidates for relegation, the English defender says their mentality and dedication will give them a vital edge.

“Half of this team have already played in the Premier League and they know what it’s about. For us, it is a massive step up but we wouldn’t be in this situation if we couldn’t handle it,” Lascelles told Reuters in an interview at St James’ Park.

“Our ‘never-say-die’ attitude will keep us fighting until the final game and that will be a massive advantage for us this season. The main aim this season is to make sure we stay up and then see just how far we can push and kick on.

“I think we’ve got the right manager (Rafa Benitez) to lead us to where we want to go and we’ve got the talent and work ethic to carry that on as well.”

With fellow North East clubs Middlesbrough and Sunderland relegated from the top flight last season, Benitez’s side are the region’s only Premier League representatives.

Skipper Lascelles is determined Newcastle will learn from their neighbours’ errors and not become another ‘yo-yo’ club, bouncing between the top two divisions.

“I don’t think we’ll make the same mistakes they did. We’ve got too big of a fan base, talented players and a fantastic manager, so I don’t think that will happen to us,” said the 23-year old, who reportedly interested Chelsea last season.

“We’re an ambitious club, (we) want to take this club further and we’ve got a massive history. As players, the onus is on us to make sure we do that.”

Lascelles, who joined Newcastle from Nottingham Forest in 2014, played through the pain in the second half of last term before having a double hernia operation in May once promotion was secured.

Newcastle travel to Huddersfield Town on Saturday, having lost their opening fixture 2-0 at home to Tottenham Hotspur last Sunday after midfielder Jonjo Shelvey was sent off.

Ahead of the trip to the John Smith’s Stadium, Lascelles said it was vital to beat their fellow promoted rivals.

“We’ve got to pick ourselves up (after the Spurs defeat) and learn from our mistakes. We know what Huddersfield are about so we need to make sure we take it to them at the weekend,” he said.

“Huddersfield are well organised, as we saw last season, they’ve got a good manager (David Wagner) and the players all work hard.

“They’re a very aggressive team but we went there last season and beat them so there’s no reason we can’t go there on Saturday and do that again,” he added.

Read this as a student of ‘history’ and you will gain the most out of it. If you have not read the Ramayana, I advise you to read a few pages about it on the Internet, this will help you get the most out of this article.

1. Never have too many controlling stakeholders in your business:

King Dashratha had three wives – Kaushalaya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi. Thus, when you have too many stakeholders in decision making, it becomes difficult to control your business. Kaushalya gave birth to Rama, Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharat and Sumitra gave birth to Laxmana and Shatrughana. Power dilutes when too many stakeholders take charge of any business.

2. Never sign a document without reading the terms and conditions:

Once queen Kaikeyi had saved King Dashratha’s life in battle. Dashratha was very pleased with his queen and thus in order to repay the favour, the king told her that she can ask for any two boons from the king. When Kaikeyi’s mind was influenced by her maid Manthara, she used these boons against her stepson Rama and tried to make her own son Bharata the next crowned king of the kingdom. She asked the king to send Rama on a 14-year-long exile to the forest and to declare her son Bharata as the next king of the kingdom. In business, you cannot trust anyone. Make sure, you have all the your contacts in black and white.

3. Learn from the experts:

King Dashratha sent his son Rama to sage Vishwamitra for learning the art of warfare. As the promoter or owner of the business, learn to send your children to the most suitable teacher. Raise your next generation of leaders by putting them in challenging situations. Help them develop the skills they must learn to face a challenging business environment.

4. Be willing to compete:

When the King Janaka organised the wedding of his daughter Sita, fearsome warriors were invited to participate in a ‘Swayamvar spardha’- the competitive act of choosing one’s husband’. The king organised a competition in which Rama defeated all other warriors and emerged as the most suitable candidate. As a business owner, expect strong competition and learn whatever it takes to win what you want ethically.

5. Do not covet what does not belong to you:

If you see the entire story plot of Ramayana you will realise that it is made up of storylines where human greed took charge. Kaikeyi wanted her son to be the next king; Ravana’s sister Surpanakha wanted to marry Laxmana, who rejected her evil advances and ended up cutting her nose; King Bali abducted the wife of his own brother Sugreeva. Likewise, Ravana wanted to possess Sita, who was the rightfully wedded wife of Rama. Ravana – blinded by his desire to possess Sita – ended up abducting her. The entire battle of Lanka was fought to free Sita from the shackles of the evil king Ravana. In your business too, learn to play ethical. Do not do anything illegal or overlook laws to secure a quick win.

6. Keep wise counsel:

Queen Kaikeyi kept an evil maid Manthara as her counsel. Over time, the woman managed to poison Kaikeyi’s mind against Rama. King Ravana avoided the counsel of his wife Mandodari who told her to return Sita respectfully to her husband. He did not listen to his own brother Vibhishana and kicked him out of his kingdom. Do not have subordinates who always try to flatter you. Surround yourself with a team of people who tell you what you need to know and not what you like to know.

7. Choose your joint venture alliances carefully:

Rama, in order to win, needed a powerful ally. Yet when it came to making an alliance, he choose Sugreeva over his powerful brother King Bali. Bali was a very powerful man who had already defeated Ravana once, and yet Rama did not join forces with him because he was an immoral man. He kicked his own brother Sugreeva out of the Kishkindha kingdom and abducted his wife. If you partner with wrong and unethical people you may win in the short run, but in the lose run will lose your reputation.

8. Negotiate and do not fight disruption:

Before declaring a full-scale war, Rama tried to negotiate with King Ravana by sending Angada as his emissary. Later on, even Hanumaan offered peace to Ravana, but he was so blinded in his ignorance that he failed to see a more powerful force. Innovate on your strategy regularly. Choose innovation over ignorance. A low of businesses die because their leader could not negotiate and adapt well to a powerful force of disruption. The businesses which do not change with time, eventually get destroyed.

Be a curious student and see what you should learn from Ramayana to take your professional life to the next level.

Jese scores debut goal as Stoke beat Arsenal 1-0,"Jese scored in the 47th minute for Stoke City. (Source: Reuters) Jese scored in the 47th minute for Stoke City. (Source: Reuters)

Spanish forward Jese marked his debut for Stoke by scoring in a 1-0 win over Arsenal in the English Premier League on Saturday.

Three days after joining on a season-long loan from Paris Saint-Germain, Jese was handed a start by Stoke manager Mark Hughes and showed why he was once regarded as one of Europe’s top young players by scoring a well-taken goal.

The former Real Madrid player passed the ball forward to Saido Berahino on the left and sprinted to meet the return pass inside the area, shooting first-time into the far corner in the 47th minute.

Jese was given a warm ovation by Stoke’s fans when he was substituted in the 71st and he already looks an inspired signing, impressing with his technique and searching runs.

Arsenal dominated possession but couldn’t match the finishing the team had in its 4-3 win over Leicester in the opening round.

When the visitors did find the net, Alexandre Lacazette’s 72nd-minute goal was ruled out for offside. Video replays suggested the France international was level with the last man when he ran onto a flick-on by substitute Olivier Giroud and smashed in a rising left-foot shot.

Goalkeeper Jack Butland saved from Danny Welbeck and Aaron Ramsey in the first half as Stoke picked up its first points of the season, after opening with a 1-0 loss at Everton.

"Mercy, My Jewels!","Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‘Mona Lisa of the North’, by Johannes Vermeer Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‘Mona Lisa of the North’, by Johannes Vermeer

Book- The Ring of Truth: Myths of Sex and Jewelry

Author- Wendy Doniger

Publication- Speaking Tiger

Pages- 397

Price- Rs 899

Wendy Doniger’s latest book, The Ring of Truth, has 45 pages of notes and a 30-page index. Yet, it is so much more than a well-annotated and minutely referenced compendium of stories about rings, lost and found, about how jewelry can establish the identity of a person or jog a buried memory of love. In Doniger’s agile mind and in her skilful hands, these become stories, as the very clever pun in the title suggests, about truth and reality, about how memory, recognition and human consciousness work for the self and for the other.

The stories in the book come from many genres, cultures and languages, but the paradigmatic story here is Kalidasa’s Shakuntala — a story about an innocent forest girl who loses the ring of recognition that the king, her ‘husband,’ gives her and then is denied physical as well as psychic recognition on account of its absence. When Dushyanta sees the ring many years later, he remembers his lost love and travels through the three worlds to find her and the son that she bore him. The child he encounters is proved to be his son through another piece of jewelry, a band that he wears on his arm. Eventually, all memories are restored, everyone is proved to be who they said they were and the family is reunited in love and happiness. A crucial character in this story is the fish who swallowed the ring that went missing – the fish, too, becomes a motif in the ocean of stories that Doniger draws upon.

Doniger takes the many strands of Kalidasa’s story and weaves them into other stories from around the world, indicating how they are alike or different from each other. But, unlike so many other gatherers of tales that resemble each other (Stith Thompson and Alan Dundes, for example), Doniger does not care about a mere taxonomy. Her interest lies not in what these stories tell us about themselves and each other, but what they tell us about ourselves — how we think, how we feel, how we construct reality, how we love those that we do and what it is, both within and without ourselves, that is lost when we lose our lovers and our memories.

Although she never leaves the world of classical mythology behind, as the sutradhar who holds the thread of rings and memory, Doniger takes us on a whirlwind tour of narratives from opera, works from 19th and 20th century literature, many contemporary works of fiction as well as to her other great love, the movies. In this volume, we get (re)acquainted with the Celtic fairy Morgana, Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Isolde, Siegfried and Brunhilde, various Shakespeare plays and a host of other lovers who are separated from each other, who cheat on each other in moments of ring-induced forgetfulness, who use rings and other personal objects to reveal their true identities or to unmask imposters.

There is also a fascinatingly detailed chapter about Marie Antoinette’s diamond necklace, a rather large, heavy and expensive piece of jewelry which, though entirely non-existent, took the allegedly extravagant and heartless queen to the guillotine. Reminding us that even in the real world, a piece of jewelry can be a potent symbol, a metonym, in fact, for a person, Doniger traces the story of this necklace-that-never-was through various historical sources. The factually verifiable version that Doniger produces of the queens and knaves, the kings and priests, the cuckolds and mistresses that animate the saga of the necklace would put Alexander Dumas to shame. Later in the book, a corollary to this chapter about the Queen’s Necklace is a thoroughly enjoyable, wise and witty takedown of De Beers, the company that markets diamonds as ‘symbols, myths, magic.’ (p.259)

Doniger tells us that The Ring of Truth actually split off from an earlier book for which she was collecting stories (The Woman who Pretended to be Who She Was, 2004). And, so it is that this book about rings of truth stays with many of Doniger’s favourite themes and recurrent concerns, such as sexual masquerade and substitution. Although she often refers to conventional Freudian readings of myth about real and imagined sexual encounters, Doniger is not afraid to call some of these encounters between men and beguiled (and most often, helpless) women ‘rape,’ for that is what they more correctly are. By analysing whatever devices of enchantment (curses, disguises, amnesia, darkness, fog) these stories use, she brings the essential nature of the pivotal sexual encounter to our attention. This persuades us to recognise how violence — emotional, physical and sexual — against women is prevalent in all cultures, hard-wired, as it is, into the stories that human beings love to tell over and over again.

Having said that, this is hardly the point of the book, which is anything but a feminist polemic against telling stories about women who lose their rings and are forgotten (or sometimes, ‘misremembered’) by their lovers. Rather, it is a book that revels precisely in these stories and the myriad ways in which we tell them. While the stories are often about sexual violence, they are even more about the cognitive violence inflicted upon the self and the other by forgetting or by the wilful erasure of memory. At a time when the danger of systematic cognitive violence against truth and memory is all too real, it is comforting to read a book which reminds you that memories can be restored, that truth can return, to heal both life and love.

"‘Poets are self-motivated souls, poetry is compulsion’: Kiriti Sengupta","“You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words”, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) “You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words”, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)

Of all romanticism associated with poetry, the ethereal and carefree life of a poet is perhaps the most adored. But is this — the state of a poet’s being — the reason for the existence of poetry, and, more so, what is a poem’s purpose?

There are no wars to be won through poetry, no great intentions behind a poem’s composition and it is more of a compulsion for self-motivated souls than a mere hobby, says Kiriti Sengupta, a gifted Indian poet, who has more than 17 books of poetry to his credit.

“I think writing poetry cannot be defined as a favourite pastime for a writer. An honest poet writes poetry out of sheer compulsion. Poets write poetry when they think it will do justice to their thoughts or expressions. There are several other ways for conveying messages, observations,and experiences, but poetry is written only when poets think they can do no better without indulging in this genre of literature,” Sengupta told IANS in an interview.

Elaborating, the much-acclaimed poet from West Bengal said that he had no “great intention” when he started composing poetry and even now he does not entertain ideas of “changing the society” through his poems. “Poetry does not change anything. It does not initiate a change either. Poetry makes you think, makes you aware, and it makes you revisit your concerns, which may include your agonies as well,” he added.

Sengupta’s “My Glass of Wine” is almost autobiographical and is now a part of India’s first poetry trilogy, “Dreams of the Sacred and Ephemeral”, which also bears two other works, “The Reverse Tree” and “Healing Waters Floating Lamps”. In the first two collections, one finds verses placed alongside prose. Sengupta stressed on the fact that he wanted to eliminate the apathy of a common reader towards poetry and thus a mix of prose and poetry was the immediate option.

But poetry is considered to be one of the finest expressions of literature and, even today, it is widely read and adored. How fulfilling is the experience of a poet then?

“You have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words. Whatever be your objective, if you do it well, you are happy at the end of the day. Prose writing is generally more time-consuming, but then, there are poems that, no matter if they are long or short, take days and even weeks to write and finish,” quipped the poet.

And then there is the writer’s bloc. Like all creative people, a poet is no stranger to this rather depressing phenomenon, but Sengupta says that one has to live with it as it is a part of the journey.

“I’ve my share of non-productive days when I fail to write. After publishing more than 17 books I don’t find it stressful or alarming any more. I just feel bad about it, but it is only when I read other poets’ work. See, it is extremely important to keep abreast of the latest happenings in the field of poetry, especially when someone is seriously engaged in it,” he maintained.

Sengupta also contested the idea that poetry has taken a backseat in recent years and said that the reality is actually contrary to popular belief. There has been a rise in poetry consciousness across India, he said, and we have more than one organisation in every city promoting poetry among new readers, especially youngsters. It is, however, debatable whether they promote quality work and enhance the availability of quality work.

He also emphasised that it is indeed impossible “to earn a living from writing poetry” in India. “Poets are self-motivated souls who write poems for the joy derived from creating a work of art,” said the poet, whose upcoming chapbook of verses is titled “Solitary Stillness” and is due to be published in August.

Decoded: Why expensive wines taste better,"It all has to do with the price tag! (Source: Thinkstock Images) It all has to do with the price tag! (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Expensive wines appear to be tastier, say scientists who have found that a higher price tag on the bottle causes the reward centre in the brain to trick the taste processing regions.

The phenomenon that identical products are perceived differently due to differences in price is called the “marketing placebo effect.”

As with placebo medications, it has an effect solely due to ascribed properties: “Quality has its price!”

“However, it has so far been unclear how the price information ultimately causes more expensive wine to also be perceived as having a better taste in the brain,” said Bernd Weber, from the University of Bonn in Germany.

The researchers assessed how different prices are translated into corresponding taste experiences in the brain, even if the wine tasted does not differ.

Thirty participants took part in the study, of which 15 were women and 15 were men, with an average age of around 30 years.

The wine tasting took place lying down in an MRI scanner, allowing brain activity to be recorded “online” while participants were tasting the wines. Each time, the price of the wine was shown first.

Only then around a millilitre of the respective wine was given to the participants via a tube in their mouths. The participants were then asked to rate via a button on a nine-point scale how good the wine tasted to them.

Their mouths were then rinsed with a neutral liquid and the next identical wine sample was given for tasting.

Researchers conducted the tests using an average to good quality red wine with a retail bottle prize of 12 euros.

In the MRI scanner, the price of this wine was shown randomly as 3, 6 and 18 euros.

“As expected, the subjects stated that the wine with the higher price tasted better than an apparently cheaper one,” said Hilke Plassmann from the INSEAD Business School in France.

Identical wine leads to a better taste experience when a greater quality expectation is associated with the wine due to its price.

The measurements of brain activity in the MRI scanner confirmed this. The research team discovered that above all parts of the medial pre-frontal cortex and also the ventral striatum were activated more when prices were higher.

While the medial pre-frontal cortex particularly appears to be involved in integrating the price comparison and thus the expectation into the evaluation of the wine, the ventral striatum forms part of the brain’s reward and motivation system.

“The reward and motivation system is activated more significantly with higher prices and apparently increases the taste experience in this way,” said Weber.

“Ultimately, the reward and motivation system plays a trick on us,” said INSEAD post-doctoral fellow Liane Schmidt.

When prices are higher, it leads us to believe that a taste is present that is not only driven by the wine itself, because the products were objectively identical in all of the tastings.

"Nick Kyrgios rips Rafael Nadal to reach semifinals, Karolina Pliskova takes two in Cincinnati","Rafael Nadal and Albert Ramos-Vinolas wore black ribbons on their shirts in memory of victims of the terror attack in Barcelona. (Source: Reuters) Rafael Nadal and Albert Ramos-Vinolas wore black ribbons on their shirts in memory of victims of the terror attack in Barcelona. (Source: Reuters)

Australia’s Nick Kyrgios humbled new world number one Rafael Nadal 6-2, 7-5, winning twice in one day to reach the WTA and ATP Cincinnati Masters semi-finals.

On a day when defending champion Karolina Pliskova won twice in one day for the third time this season to tighten her grip on the world number one ranking, Kyrgios stole the show by overpowering the 15-time Grand Slam champion after each had won earlier.

The 22-year-old from Canberra was up a double break in 10 minutes, seizing the chance to make a between-the-legs showoff shot on his way to a 4-0 lead, drawing boos from the crowd.

Kyrgios, ranked 23rd, took the first set in 25 minutes, dropping only three points on his serve while taking seven-of-eight points off the 31-year-old Spaniard’s second serves.

Nadal netted a forehand to surrender a break and a 3-2 lead to Kyrgios in the second set. The Aussie served for the match in the 10th game but double faulted on his third match point and Nadal had new life, screaming, “Come On.”

But Kyrgios broke again to lead 6-5 and this time end matters with his 10th ace after 80 minutes, improving to 2-2 all-time against Nadal and booking a Saturday semi-final against Spain’s David Ferrer.

Bulgaria’s 11th-ranked Grigor Dimitrov plays American John Isner in the other semi-final. Nadal took only 6-of-20 second serve points and won only five off the Aussie’s first serve.

Earlier, Kyrgios defeated Croatia’s Ivo Karlovic 4-6, 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 and Nadal downed compatriot Albert Ramos-Vinolas 7

-6 (7/1), 6-2.

Kyrgios, who matched his best ATP Masters runs from Miami the past two years, seeks his fourth career title after 2016 trophies at Marseille, Atlanta and Tokyo.

And he served notice for the US Open, where he has never reached the fourth round. The year’s last Grand Slam event starts August 28.

Pliskova, fighting to hold off Romania’s Simona Halep atop the rankings, first ousted Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 in one of five matches postponed from Thursday due to rain.

With only two hours between matches, the 25-year-old Czech defeated Denmark’s fifth-ranked Caroline Wozniacki 6-2, 6-4 to book a Saturday semi-final against Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza.

“I feel pretty good,” Pliskova said. “I recover well, so definitely I will be ready for tomorrow.” Second-ranked Halep eliminated British seventh seed Johanna Konta 6-4, 7-6 (7/1) to book a semi-final date with US wildcard Sloane Stephens.

“Whatever comes I will just take it,” said Pliskova. “Even if I would be second coming to the US Open, it’s still better than I was last year. So no pressure about being world number one.”

Pliskova’s two-in-one effort, matching feats on her way to Eastbourne and Doha titles, means Halep must capture the crown to swipe the top spot in Monday’s rankings.

“Not always is it going this way,” Pliskova said of her twin wins. “It’s just lucky that I always won both of them.”

– All my support to Barcelona –

Nadal, who won his 10th French Open title in June, was assured of moving into the top ranking on Monday for the first time since July 2014 when Roger Federer withdrew from Cincinnati with a back injury.

Nadal and Ramos-Vinolas wore black ribbons on their shirts in memory of victims of the terror attack Thursday in Barcelona.

“What happened yesterday in Barcelona was, of course, terrible. Everyone is very, very sad. I don’t have words to say, because when these kind of things happen, is difficult,” Nadal said.

“All my support to Barcelona and especially to the people that are suffering a lot, for all the families of the victims. Just keep going and sorry for everything.”

Drawing on a camera lens after the final match, Kyrgios wrote “Barcelona” and drew a heart. Sixth-ranked Spaniard Muguruza, wearing a black ribbon on her visor, ousted Russian eighth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-2, 5-7, 7-5 in a matchup of two-time Grand Slam winners.

Ferrer upset Austria’s eighth-ranked Dominic Thiem 6-3, 6-3 while Isner fired 25 aces in beating American wildcard Jared Donaldson 7-6 (7/4), 7-5 and Dimitrov downed Japan’s Yuichi Sugita 6-2, 6-1.

Stage set for merger of ADMK factions,"Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam (L), former AIADMK general secretary TTV Dinakaran (C) and TN Chief Minister E K Palanisami (R). Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam (L), former AIADMK general secretary TTV Dinakaran (C) and TN Chief Minister E K Palanisami (R).

Six months after former chief minister O Panneerselvam revolted and attempted to split the AIADMK, a merger seems close. At the end of many marathon meetings and tortuous negotiations over the past few months, the factions led by OPS and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami seem to have hammered out the formula for re-unification. An announcement is likely on Monday, sources on both sides said.

The two factions are allegedly under pressure from the BJP to announce the merger before August 22, the day party president Amit Shah is scheduled to visit Tamil Nadu. OPS is learnt to have taken the final decision to seal the deal at a meeting with his senior aides late on Friday night. The BJP national leadership has been informed that the merger will be announced on Monday, top leaders from both factions said.

The merger will be announced even though the key demands of the OPS camp — including the removal of Sasikala from the party — remain unmet, sources on both sides said. At least three leaders — K P Munuswamy, P H Pandian and Manoj Pandian — are likely to publicly oppose the merger, if it is announced without the removal of Sasikala.

The OPS camp’s other two major demands are: a CBI probe into J Jayalalithaa’s death, and the post of either chief minister or party general secretary for OPS. He is, however, left with very few options — his camp has only 10 MLAs, and the rival faction controls the state government. One MLA left him two weeks ago to join the ruling faction.

A third faction of the AIADMK, led by Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dinakaran, has the support of 20 MLAs — enough to topple the EPS government.

A senior ruling faction leader said a decision on removing Sasikala from the post of general secretary and the party would be taken in a month. “We cannot remove Sasikala immediately even if OPS insists,” he said. The OPS faction is learnt to have been promised that a presidium committee, co-chaired by OPS and EPS, would be formed to control the party’s affairs until the process of Sasikala’s ouster is complete.

OPS has been offered the post of deputy chief minister, and the plum portfolios of PWD and Highways, which get a large share of the state’s budgetary allocation, it is learnt. Sources said the final deal also includes the promise of two more ministerial berths for the OPS camp, besides key posts for at least top 10 leaders in the party or government — such as those of district secretary or influential posts in state boards.

While OPS and Mafoi Pandiarajan were keen to settle the issue, a section in their faction remained opposed, the sources said. “OPS is desperate. It has been more than five months since he lost power. He has no option but to agree to the merger even at the cost of backing off on demands such as the post of CM,” said a leader.

Pandiarajan told The Sunday Express that there would be a decision in two days. A crucial stage had been crossed, and a statement would be issued on Monday, he said. He declined to elaborate.

Former BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP V Maitreyan, a close OPS aide since his revolt in February, however, said a final settlement was yet to be reached. Asked about the role of the BJP, he said the party had no role in the merger.

“Both OPS and EPS never wanted to revolt but the situation made them do so. They are left with very few options,” said a minister, who is in the EPS camp, but might end up supporting Dinakaran if a situation arose.

“I wouldn’t have been an MLA or a minister without Chinnamma (Sasikala),” he said.

Dinakaran’s close aide Nanjil Sampath said Dinakaran has already proved that the entire party was supporting him. “We have proved our strength at the Melur rally. Dinakaran’s next rally in Chennai will prove it again,” he said, adding that what was happening between the two rival factions was a “forced merger”.

“When Amma (Jayalalithaa) was alive, BJP didn’t have the courage to abuse their power in Tamil Nadu. After her death, they are trying to trap all of us. This is the BJP’s plan. This state will never pardon them for creating this unrest. They will be taught a lesson finally,” Sampath said.

BJP national secretary H Raja denied the allegations. “When forced marriages are failures,” he said, “why should we go for a forced merger in the AIADMK?” “We are against Sasikala’s family politics, we will stand against that. But otherwise, we have no role in the AIADMK crisis. We are neither compelling them to merge, nor controlling their leaders,” he said.

A senior minister said on Saturday morning that the August 22 deadline for announcing the merger was likely to be met. “We are all accountable,” he said.

Liverpool reject third bid from Barcelona for Philippe Coutinho,"Philippe Coutinho is targeted by Barcelona. Philippe Coutinho is targeted by Barcelona.

Related News Philippe Coutinho left out of Liverpool’s squad for Hoffenheim

In the latest transfer news, Premier League club Liverpool have rejected a third bid of €125m (£114m) from Spanish giants Barcelona for their striker Philippe Coutinho.

After the departure of Neymar from the Camp Nou in a world transfer record to French club Paris Saint Germain, Barca strengthened their bid for the 25-year old, who had even sent a transfer request to Liverpool’s sporting director Michael Edwards.

This comes a day after Pep Segura, Barcelona’s manager of sport for football, claimed that deals for Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund striker Ousmane Dembele ‘are very close.’

The Reds, who bought Coutinho from Inter Milan for £8.5m in 2013 are intent to not let go of the Brazilian, who scored 14 goals last season for the Premier League club. In January, he signed a new five-year deal with Liverpool but had expressed his desire to play for the Catalans.

The Brazilian did not play the opening match of the season under Jurgen Klopp due to a back injury and will also be missing out in the next match against Crystal Palace. In an interview on Thursday, “They expect a lot from us after what we did last season. I am fine with the situation and am very positive about the project of Liverpool. I don’t see a lot of reasons for a player to leave the club.”

It’s paramount to the coach’s vision. “We want to qualify for the Asian Cup, and then compete with the big guns of Asia,” he says. Constantine dubs himself an ‘advocate of youth development.’ Since returning to the Indian team for his second coaching stint in 2015, the 54-year-old has handed debut caps to over 30 players. He’s found a core group of players but is still constantly on the lookout for new talent, which will ensure there is healthy competition within the team and also bolster the bench strength. “I’ve given over a 100 debuts in my coaching career,” he says. “I won’t stop as long as I see players with something to offer.”

It’s a mindset which he hopes will complement the long-term vision he has for the development of the squad. The Blue Tigers failed to qualify for the 2013 edition of the continental tournament, but Constantine is looking well beyond just qualification or a one-off participation. “We need to qualify for the Asian Cup on a regular basis. Only then can we start thinking about making it to the World Cup.”

Early next month, the Indian team is scheduled to travel to Macau to play their third qualifying match, after beating Myanmar and Kyrgyz Republic in the opening two matches. This is in contrast to the dismal World Cup qualifying campaign, which saw the team suffer a shock defeat to Guam. At that time though, Constantine had just inherited a team undergoing a transition – only Sunil Chhetri and Subrata Paul carried experience.

Since then Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Eugeneson Lyngdoh and Sandesh Jhingan – who will skipper the team against Mauritius in the tri-nations opener in Mumbai – have broken into the national side. Now as the team prepares for their international friendlies against Mauritius and St Kitts and Nevis – that too as favourites – Constantine has a chance to provide his U-23 stars opportunities to experience senior-level football.

“Sandesh was a boy and now he’s the captain,” says Constantine during the pre-match interaction. “It’s how the process goes, and soon there will be someone wanting to take his place. When the Asian Cup comes (in 2019), hopefully the U-23s and tomorrow’s captain will be a part of that.”

Constantine claims to have not named his squad for Saturday yet. But given that he wants more youngsters to make their mark, it’s expected that a few more players will make their debuts during the two friendlies. The team that will start at the Andheri Sports Complex on Saturday may not be the strongest squad in India’s ranks, but may have faces that will be the regulars over the next few years.

"After govt ‘misgivings’, UGC panel disbanded","University Grants Commission University Grants Commission

THE UNIVERSITY Grants Commission disbanded its first committee to draft qualification regulations for appointment of teachers in higher education because the government had misgivings about the head of the panel, Varun Sahni, who was a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, a source who did not wish to be identified has said.

On July 21, the UGC set up a seven-member committee, headed by Goa University Vice-Chancellor Varun Sahni, to draft regulations on the minimum qualifications for appointment of teachers and academic staff in universities and colleges.

Two weeks later, on August 3, the UGC set up another panel with the same terms of reference but with Professor Sunil Kumar Gupta, former V-C of Himachal Pradesh University, as chairperson. The circular was silent on the fate of the previous panel headed by Sahni. A source told The Indian Express: “The government had misgivings about the political leanings of professor Sahni.”

Before becoming Goa University V-C, Sahni was a professor of international politics at JNU, where he had served as chairperson of the Centre for International Politics, Organization and Disarmament and director of the International Collaboration Office. He is now on deputation leave from JNU.

When contacted by The Indian Express, Sahni confirmed that the committee he was appointed to head had been scrapped by the UGC without any reason attributed to the move.

“Regarding your question, the secretary, UGC, spoke to me on August 3 and indicated that I no longer needed to block off a large chunk of my agenda for August 2017. That’s all there is to it,” Sahni said in an email to The Indian Express. When contacted, UGC’s acting chairman V S Chauhan asked this reporter to speak to commission secretary Jaspal Singh Sandhu. The latter did not respond to calls.

Although Sandhu is learnt to have communicated the decision of disbanding the first committee to Sahni, most of the other members of the panel said they were not informed. “This is unprofessional. To first set up a committee, scrap it and not even inform members of the decision,” said one of the panel members.

Former V-C of Maharana Pratap University of Agriculture and Technology Professor S S Chahal, Jadavpur University V-C Suranjan Das and former JNU registrar K P S Unny were among the seven members of the committee. R C Kuhad, head of Haryana Central University, is the only member common in the two panels.

Tales From the Coal Crypt,"Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973.

Let me start with the positives. Subhomoy Bhattacharjee’s book on India’s coal story has all the facts that a person might want to know about this industry. And I truly mean it — from July 1836 when, through Carr, Tagore and Company, Dwarkanath Tagore (Rabindranath Tagore’s grandfather), bought out a Raniganj mine in the district of Burdwan some 130 miles northwest of Kolkata, the nationwide scandal on coal block allocations triggered by the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report of August 2012 to Naveen Jindal’s foray into tapping the coal deposits of Mozambique. It is replete with information, hard facts, interviews and extremely plausible conjectures which makes the book an essential reference kit for anyone interested in this complex and messy industry.

Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. This was a cornerstone of Indira Gandhi’s nationalisation-driven socialist rule after the Bangladesh war and the bill was enthusiastically piloted by Mohan Kumaramangalam, a sophisticated and erudite trade union leader, an ex-Communist Party of India cadre and her minister for coal and mines. Describing the private sector mines as relics of the Middle Ages and instruments of human oppression, Kumaramangalam argued that if nationalisation was postponed by another 25 years, there would be little or no coal left for the country, barring uneconomical, hazardous units, underground fires and poorly paid workers. Coal nationalisation was Mohan Kumaramangalam’s last hurrah. Very soon afterwards, he was one of the 48 who died in a terrible Indian Airlines crash on 31 May 1973.

The next chapter, ‘Coal on Sale’, looks at the large scale illegal theft in the mining and sale of coal in the decade or so that followed nationalisation — the stuff that made multi-millionaires of thugs led by the infamous four-term MLA Surya Deo Singh who became the legend and godfather of Dhanbad, as well as others such as Babloo Srivastava, Brijesh Singh, Hari Shankar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi. A part of every transaction in the nationalised mines from recruitment to sales and transport had to be paid to these goons; nothing could work without their say-so and their cuts. Bhattacharjee then uses the theme of ‘coal on sale’ to transit from small to very large sales via Manoj Jayaswal, a hitherto unknown cricket-loving businessman from Nagpur and his application for a large coal block in Chhattisgarh; to be followed by Naveen Jindal and Sandeep Jajodia of Monnet Ispat.

That sets the stage for Bhattacharjee’s next chapter entitled, self-evidently, as ‘Notes from an Auditor’. It covers the famous CAG report under Vinod Rai’s tenure and goes into the entire coal mine leasing scam in great detail — including the irreparable political damage it caused prime minister Manmohan Singh, the intervention of the Supreme Court which nullified almost all hitherto held coal block auctions, and the travails of the coal secretary PC Parakh and his successor Harish Chandra Gupta. To my mind, it is the best chapter of the book.

After that, the book meanders over the next four chapters. To be sure, it looks into some key issues such as environmental brakes and the part that Jairam Ramesh played as the minister for environment and forests; the role of entrepreneurs; the cost of the failure of coal block auctions to the banking system, especially those that had large exposures in coal based power plants and associated mining rights; a foray into international acquisitions, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa; and on India’s energy ambitions. Each chapter has considerable information. However, these somehow do not hold together as part of a continuous book.

Which brings me to my basic criticism. Here is a book that has enough material to have become a classic on the subject. Yet, it begs a coherence of purpose and narrative that such a book demands. It is as if there are many informative journalistic copies, each structured in 600-word formats, but few flowing from one to the other, to create tightly knit chapters leading to an ‘un-put-down-able’ book. Unlike, for instance, the books of fellow journalists such as Andrew Ross Sorkin’s Too Big to Fail, William D. Cohen’s Money and Power, any of David Halberstam’s works and, nearer home, some of Arun Shourie’s books or TN Ninan’s Turn of the Tortoise, Bhattacharjee does not tie together the many fascinating micro-pieces into the structure of a consistently well reading book. Perhaps it reflects the absence of the publishing editor, who ought to have helped in this task. Also, there are some serious editorial shortfalls, the most obvious one being that, despite having a 14-page bibliography printed in a tiny font-size, there is not a single footnote or endnote in the text to correlate these with the references.

There are so many informative nuggets in this work which, if fused well, ought to have made for a great book. It is, no doubt, a sound reference guide. But it could have been so much more. And that’s the pity.

"I don’t want others to learn patience the way I have, says Sanjay Dutt","Sanjay Dutt opens up about his life, his movies and his relationship with directors before the release of his comeback film Bhoomi. Sanjay Dutt opens up about his life, his movies and his relationship with directors before the release of his comeback film Bhoomi.

The vastness of a star-lit sky finally reassured Sanjay Dutt that he was “free”. On the night of February 25, 2016, having been released from Pune’s Yerwada Central Jail after serving a six-year sentence, the actor went up to the terrace of Imperial Heights, his 14-storied family home in Mumbai’s Pali Hill. “I lay down on the terrace and looked at the sky above. That made me realise that there were no bars around me anymore,” says the actor. Dutt was embroiled in a long legal battle since his arrest on April 19, 1993 under TADA and the Arms Act for his alleged role in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts. He was convicted in 2013 for illegal possession of weapons.

With the 23-year tryst with law behind him, Dutt is making a “comeback” with Bhoomi, a film directed by Omung Kumar, which releases on September 22. The years spent in dealing with his drug habit, courtrooms, and prison life, he says, has brought about a big change. “I am a much more patient man. It takes a long time for me to lose my temper. I tell myself, jaane do (let it go). I was very short-tempered. Very rash. But I don’t want others to learn patience the way I have,” he says, when we meet in a glass-enclosed room in Imperial Heights.

The 58-year-old actor is wearing a pair of jeans, a black T-shirt and printed leather shoes. His well-toned body sports multiple tattoos, while his hair and beard are carefully clipped and dyed. Dutt chose Bhoomi, a film about a father’s search for justice for his raped daughter, because of its “strong message”. “Bhoomi is a story of a father and daughter from a lower middle-class background living in a small town. When the daughter is raped, it shows how the family deals with it,” says the actor, who is also father to six-year-old twins Iqra and Shahraan, and Trishala, from an earlier marriage. He claims to be “as protective as any father” can get. “According to me, a girl is a blessing not a burden. I’m all for beti bachao and women’s empowerment,” he says.

As an interviewee, Dutt is known to give short answers. He lives up to that reputation, even though he does not dodge any question or shy away from talking about his past. “I don’t want anyone to go through the same ordeal. One has to be balanced and focussed to be able to do that. However, the best part is to learn from it and forget about it.” Has forgetting been easy? “No. But you have to move on in life. I want to work. I want to spend time with my kids and family,” he says.

Actor Ranbir Kapoor, who is playing the character of Dutt in a biopic directed by Rajkumar Hirani, had called his story “inspiring”. “Sanjay Dutt is so controversial and yet loved. The biopic is an honest take on an ordinary man, his mistakes as well as his relationship with his father and friends,” he had said in an earlier interview. Dutt has gone through the script of the film and visited its sets a couple of times. “The film does not glorify me. It depicts the truth,” he says.

Dutt has an impressive line-up of releases in the next two years — Sanjay Leela Bhansali-directed Padmavati, Abhishek Varman’s Shiddat with Alia Bhatt and Sridevi as co-actors; and Hasmukh Pighal Gaya, directed by Sejal Shah. He is also supposed to feature in Malang, produced by his old associate Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Dutt is also likely to feature in the future projects of Tigmanshu Dhulia, Mahesh Manjrekar and Anubhav Sinha. “I believe in commercial cinema. I am here to entertain people,” says the actor. While choosing a film, he goes by the character, screenplay and script. “My choice also depends on who is directing the film,” he adds.

One of the key factors that has sustained Dutt in the industry for 36 years is the affection and goodwill he enjoys, and the strong bonds he has with directors. Hirani and Chopra swear by him while Kumar wants to do another film with him. “I enjoy working with them and they enjoy working with me. Till the time I have a good bonding with the directors, I can’t work. That is very important. My relationship with them goes beyond the sets,” he says. Kumar vouches for his affability. “Before the making of Bhoomi, I did not know him well. Today, I feel I have known him for years,” he says.

Both Kumar and Karan Malhotra, who directed Agneepath (2012), are impressed by Dutt’s trust in his directors; he never checks the rushes after giving a shot. According to Malhotra, he is like a “lamb” on the sets and does what the director wants. While shooting for Agneepath in the 40-degree summer temperatures of Diu, Malhotra was struggling to maintain Dutt’s bald look, created through prosthetics. Dutt solved the problem by shaving off his hair. “It is this accommodating nature that has sustained his popularity,” says Malhotra.

It has also helped that Dutt is his father’s son. Sunil Dutt was an immensely loved and respected actor and Congress politician, with friends across the political spectrum. “My father used to tell me, ‘Ultimately, you have to be a nice human being, whether you are up or down in life’,” he says. Dutt was 22 when his mother, the actor Nargis, died of cancer. His father became his biggest source of strength. Sunil stood by his side all through, whether it was when he had to check into rehab for his addiction or during the TADA trials.

Despite a rough ride, Dutt considers himself “lucky”. “People believed in my work and the directors believed that the role in Khal Nayak (1993) or Vaastav (1996) was perfect for me,” he says. The actor, who made his debut in Rocky (1981), directed by his father, also counts Naam (1986), Sadak (1991), Munnabhai MBBS (2003), Shabd (2005) and Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006) as some of his best films.

There is another side of Dutt, which is rarely spoken about. He grew up in a multi-faith household; Nargis was a Muslim and his father Hindu. In jail, he says, he read texts of many religions. “I respect all religions. My parents never told me to choose any particular religion. However, I believe in Hinduism and my god is Lord Shiva. I love him. I follow Bholenath’s path,” says Dutt. His reading, he says, has led him to conclude that “all religions talk of peace”.

After being an actor and producer for over three decades, Dutt eventually wants to direct movies. “But not now. My dad directed some fantastic movies like Yaadein and Reshma Aur Shera.

But I would like to make commercial movies. I wish to entertain the audience,” he says.

Australia arrive in Bangladesh under tight security,"The last time Australia played a Test on Bangladesh soil was in 2006, under Ricky Ponting’s captaincy. (Source: File) The last time Australia played a Test on Bangladesh soil was in 2006, under Ricky Ponting’s captaincy. (Source: File)

Australian cricket team is all set for the Bangladesh tour as they arrived in Dhaka under tight security on Friday. It has been more than a decade since Australia last visited Bangladesh for a Test tour. The last time Australia played a Test on Bangladesh soil was in 2006 under Ricky Ponting’s captaincy.

The BCB’s chief executive officer, Nizamuddin Chowdhury, said that Team Australia arrived at Dhaka airport at 10.50 pm under tight security. “Since the team landed it was given the security as we’ve promised. We are confident everything will go according to our plan,” he told news agency AFP.

To make sure Australian team’s safe landing, around 300 members of elite police units were on guard at Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjahal International Airport, the police said. “We’ve adequate security arrangements at the airport. We’ve even cleared the road (leading to the team’s hotel),” Armed Police Battalion’s inspector, Moslem Uddin said.

Bangladesh attained Test status in 2000 by the ICC. Australia’s Test series in Bangladesh was scheduled two years back in 2015, but due to security reasons, it had to be called off.

Sean Carroll, CA’s security manager, who is also part of the 32-member Australian party, visited Dhaka early to ensure the conditions are perfect to host the series. He has visited Bangladesh thrice in last 12 months to check the security measures.

The visitors will begin their tour with a two-day warm-up match on August 22 and 23, followed by their first Test of the series at Sher-e Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka on August 27. The second Test between the two will be played at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong.

The British Library is digitising rare printed Bengali books,"To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo) To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo)

The British Library, which is leading an international partnership to digitise rare material from its South Asian printed book collection, has scanned 1,000 old and rare printed Bengali books of the 19th century, according to project co-ordinators.

As part of the ‘Two Centuries of Indian Print’ (TCIP) project, in total, 4,000 early printed Bengali books, amounting to more than 800,000 pages, will be digitised and made freely available online.

“So far we scanned 1,000 books. There are books literally from every discipline you could think of. There are treatises on sciences, education, religion, missionaries coming to India and translation of the Bible,” Tom Derrick, Digital Curator, TCIP told IANS here at the Jadavpur University on the sidelines of a symposium exploring the history of print in South Asia.

The TCIP pilot project is a partnership between the British Library, the School of Cultural Texts and Records (SCTR) of Jadavpur University, Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, and the Library at SOAS University of London, involving collaborations with the National Library of India.

It marks the start of a major programme to share the wealth of Indian printed books held by the British Library dating from 1713 to 1914. Another aspect to the project is applying OCR (optical character recognition) to transcribe the Bengali script. OCR is the recognition of printed or written text characters by a computer.

“We are dealing with historical Bangla and the changes in the language, so the typography is unique. It is underserved by commercial OCR whose focus is more on Western patterns,” explained Derrick.

To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. “So over 20 institutes worldwide have signed up,” he said. According to Layli Uddin, project curator (Bengali) at the British Library, the approach is three-pronged: cataloguing, digitising and contextualising.

“We want to reach out to a wider audience, make the materials open and free to all, make it accessible to non-Bengali speaking audiences as well. Also to contextualise and that is where the Jadavpur University experts come in. They are helping identify what is unique and rare in BL’s collectionsa printed materials which are not available elsewhere in the world,” Uddin told IANS.

Abhijit Gupta, joint director, SCTR, says the the thinner the book, the rarer they are.

“The British Library used a unique mechanisma they used to bind together thin books to preserve them. One of the rare books that is part of the project is ‘Advice for Railway Travellers’ which gives information on railway schedule after the advent of railways. The point of digitising is to access part of the landscape which we know exists but we can’t seea they are in libraries across the world.” added Gupta.

IOC and Odisha govt strike deal on tax incentives for Paradip oil refinery,"Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and the state government agreed to the revised terms at the meeting called at the behest of Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and the state government agreed to the revised terms at the meeting called at the behest of Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.

Odisha government, which had withdrawn tax incentives to the Rs 34,555-crore Paradip refinery of IOC, has agreed to restore some of the tax breaks including a Rs 700-crore per annum of interest-free loan, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today. The breakthrough came after Pradhan met Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik here yesterday.

“It is agreed that state government will give Rs 700 crore per annum interest-free loan for 15 years; earlier state head agreed to provide total deferment of VAT,” Pradhan said in a twitter post.

Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and the state government agreed to the revised terms at the meeting called at the behest of Pradhan.

The Odisha government had on February 22 written to IOC, its single-biggest investor, saying it is withdrawing the promised 11-year deferment on payment of sales tax on Paradip refinery products sold in the state. The withdrawal was to cost Rs 2,000 crore to IOC this year and will progressively increase every year as more petrol, diesel and petrochemicals are sold within the state. The company dragged the state government to court for walking back on its commitment and has not paid VAT on products sold in the state since commissioning of the refinery last year.

The agreement on interest-free loan for 15 years would give additional revenue to the state, Pradhan said. “This would give a substantial amount of additional #revenue (Around Rs 1,500 crore per year) to the state of #Odisha. #ParadipRefinery,” he said in another tweet.

“This is a historic day for people of #Odisha; dwellers of the state have got their dues without spoiling the industrial atmosphere of the state,” he added.

Sources said, in the latest agreement reached, the viability gap funding for Paradip refinery project will be revised to Rs 700 crore per annum payable in four equal instalments in each quarter in the form of interest-free loan for 15 years starting from financial year 2016-17. IOC will deposit applicable VAT or GST on products sold.

Odisha government will pay the viability gap fund in the form of interest-free loan in each quarter. The repayment of the amount will start in 16th year for each instalment, they said. VAT collected and not paid in 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017 -18 will be deposited by IOC immediately. Odisha government will provide interest-fee loan to IOC for 2016-17 and 3 quarters of current year by December 2017 or January 2018 and every quarter thereafter.

Sources said the state government has also agreed to waive interest/penalty for the VAT withheld by IOC. A joint petition will be filed in the Orissa High Court, Cuttack informing about the agreement, they said.

Lebanon army advances against Islamic State in border battle along Syria,"Lebanon’s military estimated around 600 IS fighters were present in the Jurud Ras Baalbek and Jurud al-Qaa areas, controlling around 120 square kilometres of territory before Saturday’s advances.

Lebanese soldiers renewed fire on Islamic State group positions on the country’s eastern border with Syria today after capturing a third of the territory held by jihadists in the area. Lebanon’s army began its operation in the Jurud Ras Baalbek and Jurud al-Qaa region early on Saturday, and in the first day captured around 30 square kilometres of territory, a military spokesman said.

“That is around a third of the area controlled by the terrorists,” Brigadier General Nazih Jreij said late Saturday. Jreij said 20 IS fighters had been killed in the clashes, and 10 Lebanese soldiers wounded. Lebanon’s battle against IS comes as the jihadist group faces assaults in both neighbouring Syria and Iraq, where the government early Sunday announced an offensive on the group’s bastion of Tal Afar.

The attack also comes after IS claimed several international attacks, including twin car ramming incidents in Spain that killed 14 people. Lebanese soldiers raised the Spanish flag on a hilltop captured from IS on Saturday in a tribute to the victims of those attacks, the army said.

Lebanon’s military estimated around 600 IS fighters were present in the Jurud Ras Baalbek and Jurud al-Qaa areas, controlling around 120 square kilometres of territory before Saturday’s advances. On Sunday, Lebanon’s National News Agency reported soldiers were firing heavy artillery and rockets at IS positions in Jurud Ras Baalbek.

The army’s assault comes after Lebanon’s powerful Shiite militant group Hezbollah waged its own campaign against jihadists operating in another border area south of the current battle. The group’s six-day offensive against IS and Al-Qaeda’s former affiliate in the Jurud Arsal area ended with a ceasefire.

The agreement saw around 8,000 refugees and jihadists transported to a jihadist-held area of northwestern Syria in return for the release of five captured Hezbollah fighters.

Hezbollah said Saturday it had launched a simultaneous operation against IS from the Syrian side of the border, where the group’s fighters are battling alongside President Bashar al-Assad’s army against rebels. Lebanon’s army denied any coordination with Hezbollah or the Syrian army.

Hezbollah’s War Media outlet said its fighters and the Syrian army had on Saturday “managed to liberate 87 square kilometres of the total area controlled by the Daesh (IS) organisation… in western Qalamun region” of Syria.

"Sunanda Pushkar death probe: Forensic team to visit hotel suite on Sep 1, court told","Sunanda Pushkar was found dead on January 17, 2014 Sunanda Pushkar was found dead on January 17, 2014

A forensic team will visit the suite at the Hotel Leela Palace — where Sunanda Pushkar’s body was found — to collect more evidence, a Delhi court was told on Saturday. The information about the proposed visit by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) team was disclosed to the court by the hotel management, that had previously sought de-sealing of the suite. The counsel for the hotel told the court that they received a letter from the police on Friday stating that the CFSL team would visit the suite on September 1.

On Saturday, Metropolitan Magistrate Dharmender Singh also criticised the Delhi Police for delaying the de-sealing of the suite and pointed out that an order had been passed on July 21 asking it to de-seal the premises within four weeks. “Why did you take two months to inform the hotel that you will need more time,” the court asked the police.The court, however, allowed the police plea seeking one more opportunity for filing of the compliance report in the court regarding de-sealing of the suite. It directed the agency to file the report on September 4.

The court had, on July 21, ordered the de-sealing of the suite in the five-star hotel within “four weeks”. The order had come after authorities of Hotel Leela had filed a petition, stating that they were suffering “huge losses” because of the locked room. However, the court had granted liberty to Delhi Police to file an application seeking more time for probe if they cannot conclude the investigation within the given time. The hotel, in its plea, had also said that in the last one year, no team has visited suite number 345 and that sealing the room “is no longer required”.

President Bashar al-Assad advisor says Syria war nearing its end,"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. With firepower freed up by the truces, the government is extending its grip towards Islamic State territory in the vast eastern deserts. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. With firepower freed up by the truces, the government is extending its grip towards Islamic State territory in the vast eastern deserts.

An advisor to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said the six-year war is nearly over as foreign states cut backing for rebels, and vowed the government would confront any “illegitimate” forces, whether Turkish or American. Bouthaina Shaaban said the fact that Syria was staging the Damascus International Fair for the first time in the war “sends a message that the war has ended … and we are at the start of the path towards reconstruction.”

With the help of Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, Damascus has shored up its rule over much of the country’s populated west. Now, it is marching eastward towards the Deir al-Zor region near the Iraqi border. The war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, has reached its “penultimate stage” as foreign powers that backed rebels change their policies, Shaaban said in comments to Lebanese al-Mayadeen TV carried on Syrian state news agency SANA on Thursday.

U.S. President Donald Trump has ended CIA support to rebel groups fighting to topple Assad. Turkey, long one of the main rebel backers, has also shifted its priority away from ousting Assad, seeking to mend ties with Russia and curb Kurdish expansion near its border. “Just as we defeated terrorism, we will fight any illegitimate presence on our land, whether it’s the United States or Turkey,” Shaaban said. “And this is among the challenges we will face at the right time in the right way.”

U.S. forces based in northern Syria are helping Kurdish-led militias push Islamic State militants out of Raqqa city. Washington also has a garrison in the southeast Syrian desert, near a strategic highway border crossing with Iraq, to train local rebels to battle Islamic State. Shaaban said this week’s Damascus trade fair and regional participation proved a “U-turn was achieved” in the conflict, a shift the Syrian army and allied forces were imposing since they seized Aleppo city late last year.

Still, the multi-sided conflict has raged on along several fronts across the country, with Islamic State losing ground to various separate enemies. And while the government has forced several major insurgent enclaves to surrender over the past year, rebels still hold swathes of land, including their stronghold of Idlib province and a pocket of territory near Damascus.

The battle against rebels in western Syria has recently shifted down several gears after a string of ceasefire deals, including one Moscow and Washington brokered for the southwest.

With firepower freed up by the truces, the government is extending its grip towards Islamic State territory in the vast eastern deserts. Syria’s war, which spiralled into violence after mass protests against Assad’s rule in 2011, has made more than 11 million people homeless and sparked a global refugee crisis.

"Shikhar Dhawan will win you games as long he’s in this happy zone, says Virat Kohli","Shikhar Dhawan (R) scored a century for India off just 71 balls. (Source: Reuters) Shikhar Dhawan (R) scored a century for India off just 71 balls. (Source: Reuters)

Shikhar Dhawan has been chasing in on his purple patch and the last three months have been great for the Indian opener who has performed in both Tests and one-day international, captain of the Indian cricket team Virat Kohli said after Dhawan guided India to another victory with a century against Sri Lanka on Sunday.

“The last three months have been a great time for Dhawan and he’s cashing in on his purple patch. Hopefully he stays in this happy zone and we’ll make sure he stays there, because he will win you games as long he’s in it. Once he starts going, it’s very difficult to stop him,” Kohli said.

Set a target of 217, India rode on Dhawan’s century which came off just 71 balls. India chased down the target in just 28.5 overs. Sri Lanka were off to a good start making 139 for one wicket in 25 overs before a collapse saw them being bowled out for 216.

“They got off to a really good start. We thought we would chase close to 300, it was a good pitch to bat on. The point of batting second was that it would come on later in the day. It came on like a dream.” he said.

Talking about the 2019 World Cup, Kohli said that they need to prepare from now and they won’t mind experimenting. He also said that there will be lot of changes in the playing XI of the team.

“Yes (we have our eyes set on 2019) . You have to prepare 24 months in advance. We’re going to experiment and embrace that. You can [expect to] see a lot of changes [from now on]. All the guys have bought into it. it’s all about what gives us more balance. Start of the series it’s about getting the batting right.

“Axar brings something with the bat and he’s a gun fielder. We felt one wrist-spinner was enough. In another match, we might bring in a pacer or play three spinners. It’s all about getting the balance,” he said on dropping Kuldeep Yadav.

Sri Lanka captain Upul Tharanga also said that his team got off to a good start and should have capitalised on it but failed to do so.

“We started really well and after that we didn’t capitalise. The middle order collapsed. One stage, we were thinking of 300. If you want to score 300 in an ODI, someone has to get a big score. We have to learn from the mistakes. The main thing is someone has to get a big one. The bowling also has to become more consistent,” he said.

Dhawan, who got the man-of-the-match award for his unbeaten 132, said that he wanted to play positive and focus on the process. He was playing the ball to its merit.

“Things have been going well for me and I’ve just been focussing on my processes. I have mental freedom and when you perform well, you have extra confidence. By the grace of god, things are going my way. Just wanted to play positively and on the merit of the ball today.” he said.

"US, Japan vow to boost defence cooperation with India, South Korea, Australia","US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson shakes hands with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, Thursday, August 17, 2017, after a news conference at the State Department in Washington. (Source: AP Photo) US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson shakes hands with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, Thursday, August 17, 2017, after a news conference at the State Department in Washington. (Source: AP Photo)

The US and Japan have agreed to advance their multilateral security and defence cooperation with countries like India, South Korea and Australia, amidst China’s growing assertiveness in the Asia Pacific region. “We will cooperate to advance trilateral and multilateral security and defence cooperation with other partners in the region, notably the Republic of Korea, Australia, India and other southeast Asian countries,” US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters at a news conference here with Defence Secretary James Mattis.

The news conference was also jointly addressed by Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera. “(With) ROK (South Korea), Australia, India and Southeast Asian countries, we will promote more than ever before cooperation in security and defence,” Kono said in Japanese which was translated into English. The four top officials were interacting with reporters after the newly launched US-Japan two plus two dialogue.

During the meeting held yesterday at the headquarters of the State Department, the four leaders among other issues discussed the increasing challenge posed by China in the region and the need to enhance multilateral cooperation with other countries, including India, in the region. “The ministers highlighted ongoing Alliance efforts to advance trilateral and multilateral security and defence cooperation with other partners in the region, notably the Republic of Korea, Australia, India and Southeast Asian countries,” a joint statement issued after the meeting said.

“The ministers underscored the importance of cooperating to promote a rules-based international order, taking note of the United States’ continued commitment to maintain a strong presence in the region and Japan’s initiatives demonstrated by its ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy’,” the statement said.

According to the joint statement, the ministers strongly encourage China to take decisive measures to urge North Korea to change its course of action. Expressing continuing concerns about the security environment in the East China Sea, they reaffirmed the importance of working together to safeguard the peace and stability of the East China Sea.

Expressing serious concern about the situation in the South China Sea, they reaffirmed their opposition to unilateral coercive actions by claimants, including the reclamation and militarisation of disputed features, that alter the status quo and increase tensions.

Reiterating the importance of the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes through full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, including arbitration, they emphasised the importance of compliance with the international law of the sea, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, including respect for freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea. “The Ministers underlined the significance of continued engagement in the South China Sea, including through respective activities to support freedom of navigation, bilateral and multilateral training and exercises, and coordinated capacity building assistance,” the statement said.

Tillerson said they discussed their concern about the security environment in the East China Sea and South China Sea. “The United States and Japan oppose any unilateral action that seeks to undermine Japan’s administration of the Senkaku Islands, and we reaffirmed that Article 5 of the US-Japan Security Treaty covers these islands. We also oppose militarisation activity in the South China Sea,” he said.

“Maritime disputes should be settled peacefully and maintain the freedom of navigation in accordance with the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea. We maintain our unwavering commitment to the 2015 guidelines for US-Japan defence cooperation, and we have instructed our staff to accelerate their implementation,” he said.

Kono echoed Tillerson’s views, saying, Japan shared its concerns regarding the situation surrounding East and South China Sea. “We reaffirmed that the Senkaku Islands are within the scope of Article 5 of the Japan-US Security Treaty, and that we would oppose any unilateral behaviour attempting to undermine Japan’s administration of the Senkaku Islands,” he said.

“For the peace and stability of East Asia and East China Sea, we will continue to cooperate with the United States. On the South China Sea, we have confirmed that we need to continue to engage ourselves and watch for any acts which would impede freedom of navigation,” Kono said.

“Under this severe security environment, under all situations, the alliance must secure seamless response, and it’s extremely important. And we agreed that we would properly examine ways to strengthen the alliance,” he said.

Israel destroys home of Palestinian who killed officer,"Israel’s military says forces have demolished the home of a Palestinian involved in attacks that killed a young female police officer in Jerusalem. It said troops early Thursday destroyed the West Bank residence of one of the attackers. Palestinians armed with an automatic weapon and knives assaulted officers on duty near Jerusalem’s Old City in June. Staff Sgt. Maj. Hadas Malka, 23, was rushing to respond to the initial attack when a Palestinian assaulted her with a knife.

Israel says the demolitions are an effective deterrent. Critics say it amounts to collective punishment. Since 2015, Palestinians have killed 48 Israelis, two visiting Americans and a British tourist in stabbings, shooting and car-ramming attacks. In that time, Israeli forces killed over 255 Palestinians, most said by Israel to be attackers.

The way back home: Will we ever be the India that was envisioned?,"The eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it. The eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it.

Reena Kallat Synapse, Single channel video projection, 2011

Studies say that the eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it and no two people see anything exactly alike. We create meaning through a mental bridge that the mind forms to complete gaps.

My video Synapse is an ironic play on legibility, where we witness 14 individuals’ attempts at reading the letters on a Snellen chart at an ophthalmologist’s clinic. The traditional Snellen (eye chart), meant to measure visual acuity, in this case happens to have been replaced by a variation comprising the fragmented letters of the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, which commences with “We the people of India…” Each person tries to make sense of the alphabets before them with hesitations and uncertainties, interrupted recurrently with change of lenses and monotonous questions regarding clarity of vision. Their pauses seem less about the limitations of their vision, and, instead, appear to metaphorically demonstrate an ordinary citizen’s blurred view of the most inclusive document of the nation.

Some of these ideas have preoccupied me for years and I’ve made several works that refer to the Preamble of the Constitution of India to examine our role as citizens vis-a-vis the republic. Through this video I made in 2011, I reflect upon our own limitations in understanding our responsibilities that come along with the freedom promised through the Constitution and how we choose to interpret it. Nearly 70 years after the fundamental principles of the Constitution were first laid down, we are far from having achieved these values. Fulfilling these can, perhaps, only be made possible if we collectively strive towards attaining them rather than allowing ourselves to be divided as a people, by being fooled into believing that these would be provided for.

Samit Das, Bibliography in Progress, 2016

History depends on archaeology and its excavation, on myths and archives. For a long time now, I have been looking at history not just as an unchangeable culture or a particular person’s assumption/ studies, but as a documentation of the growth process of society through a contemporary approach. History should be open for everyone to understand and interpret.

It is the same with art. One cannot be contemporary if one denies history. In the series ‘Bibliography in Progress’, I have looked at the Harappan civilization and I am working with images from the Constitution of India for another set. I attained a copy of the Illustrated Constitution published in 2000/2001, and am looking at the illustrations done by Nandalal Bose and his students. It is difficult to say if we are the India that our Constitution promised — there are various dimensions, and, something might be right according to one person and wrong according to other. All of these point to a multi-layered thought process intrinsic to a democracy.

Venkat Shyam, Freedom, acrylic on canvas, 2016

We have a long way to go before we become the India that was envisioned, where everyone is equal and enjoys liberty and justice. This particular work discusses gender equality and shows a woman walking hand-in-hand with a man. We speak of equality between men and women, but that is hardly a reality. A woman has to carry the burden of household responsibilities, despite whatever work she does outside her home. In this image, she has the globe inside her, representing the universe, but also a scorpion crawling on her, depicting her daily struggles.

We are living in times when personal greed is overtaking the ideas that our society was built on. This erasure is, of course, incomplete, dependent as it is on the demands of that hour. For instance, we save things on the computer, but when we want to remove the data from the hard disk, maintaining privacy is not as simple as it may have seemed at first. The first thought is that when you “delete” the file, the data is gone. Not quite — it only removes the reference of the file from the file system table. The file remains on the disk and can be retrieved. Similarly, we are aware of the values and principles that we have inherited, but are choosing to ignore them.

Riyas Komu, Fourth World, terracotta installation, 2017

The Lion Capital from the Buddhist tradition is one of the best images any nation can have to represent its diversity, multiculturalism and secularism. It represents the four dimensions that India as a country has always upheld, and that is something I have always enjoyed in the symbolism.

We are getting a feeling that this symbolism is crumbling. The four dimensions represent the “unity in diversity” that our Constitution enshrines. Though we do not see the fourth dimension, its presence is there, always unified with the other three and that was the strength of this republic. Conceptually, when this unity breaks, when we are no longer able to rely on the unseen fourth dimension, that’s when the anxieties of the State, and political and administrative processes surface. We’re excluded from these, making it easier for power structures to erase cultural differences and instill ideas of homogenisation in its citizens.

Mobile videos may help parents stick to infants’ sleep practices,"The recommended safe sleep practices were placing babies on their backs, not on their sides or stomachs; keeping them in the room with the mother but not in the same bed. (Source: File Photo) The recommended safe sleep practices were placing babies on their backs, not on their sides or stomachs; keeping them in the room with the mother but not in the same bed. (Source: File Photo)

A mobile programme of informational videos and messages may improve parents’ adherence to safe sleep practices for infants, new research has found. The researchers tested two different types of educational interventions. The first involved nurses teaching new parents about safe sleep practices for infants while still in the hospital. The the second intervention the mobile programme involved delivering information through e-mails, messages and videos.

Following recommended safe sleep practices can reduce the risk of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). The recommended safe sleep practices were placing babies on their backs, not on their sides or stomachs; keeping them in the room with the mother but not in the same bed; avoiding soft bedding that could strangle or suffocate infants; and using pacifiers, which has been shown to reduce SIDS risk.

“We’d been looking at the prevalence of safe sleep practices for a long time, and I had been getting really energised about doing a study that takes what we know about safe sleep prevalence and tests an intervention that might help improve the adherence to the ‘gold standard’ safe sleep practices,” said Eve Colson, Professor at Yale School of Medicine, Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, US.

According to the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, mobile videos for educating new parents on safe infant sleep practices achieved rates of 92.5 per cent for back sleeping and 85.9 per cent for room-sharing without bed-sharing, two of the critical steps towards SUID reduction. These rates were much higher than those for the group who received only the in-hospital intervention on safe sleep practices.

In a clinical trial with 1,263 families, “mothers who received a mobile health intervention with regular text or email messages and videos reported statistically significantly higher rates of placing their infants supine to sleep compared with mothers who received control interventions”, the study said.

"Shikhar Dhawan scores 11th century, his fastest in ODIs","Shikhar Dhawan scored his 11th ODI century. (Source: Reuters) Shikhar Dhawan scored his 11th ODI century. (Source: Reuters)

After amassing runs in the Test series against Sri Lanka, India opener Shikhar Dhawan continued his fine form in the one-day internationals as well. Dhawan was the man-of-the-series in the three-match Test series in which he scored two centuries in four innings. He began the ODI series the same way as he began the Test series — with a hundred. In the first ODI against Sri Lanka at Dambulla, Dhawan scored his 11th century and that too in quick time. The opener took only 71 balls to reach the three-figure mark.

With the 71-ball hundred, Dhawan now has his fastest ODI hundred. He surpassed his previous record of 73 balls where he scored a century against West Indies in Kanpur in 2013. He also has a 80-ball hundred against South Africa in the first match of the 2013 Champions Trophy 2013.

The last time India played Sri Lanka was at The Oval in the 2017 Champions Trophy and Dhawan scored a century in that match as well. Though India lost the game, it was Dhawan’s second century against Sri Lanka. In his last five innings against the Island Nation, Dhawan has an exceptional record with three centuries.

Dhawan’s record against Sri Lanka has been phenomenal. In the last five innings, he has scores of 94, 113, 79, 91 and 125. With another century in Dambulla on Sunday, he now has three centuries in last six innings against Sri Lanka.

Underdogs Europe seize early one-point lead in Solheim Cup,"World number 13, Anna Nordqvist ranks among the top 20 for Team Europe. (Source: AP) World number 13, Anna Nordqvist ranks among the top 20 for Team Europe. (Source: AP)

Underdogs Europe won the last two Solheim Cup matches in the opening foursomes session to take a 2-1/2 to 1-1/2 lead over the United States on Friday in the biennial tournament at the Des Moines Golf & Country Club in Iowa.

Anna Nordqvist and rookie Georgia Hall comfortably beat Americans Paula Creamer and Austin Ernst 3&1, while the last-minute pairing of Karine Icher and Catriona Matthew edged Stacy Lewis and Gerina Piller 1-up to give Europe an early advantage.

Rookie Danielle Kang and Lizette Salas beat Europe’s Carlota Ciganda and Caroline Masson 1-up, while Americans Cristie Kerr and Lexi Thompson halved the opening alternate-shot match against Team Europe’s Mel Reid and Charley Hull.

Four four-ball, or best-ball, matches were being contested in the afternoon in the electric atmosphere of the team event. Following the late withdrawal of Suzann Pettersen with a bad back, only world number 13 Nordqvist ranks among the top 20 for Team Europe, while the U.S. have four players in number two Thompson, Kerr, Lewis and Kang in that category.

Rankings mattered little once the matches began though. Nordqvist and Hall birdied to win the second hole and never trailed, closing out the match by winning the 16th and 17th. “Georgia is a rookie but she certainly didn’t play like one,” said Nordqvist. “She played great.”

UNLIKELY VICTORY

Matthew moved from vice-captain to playing member to replace Pettersen and with Icher registered an unlikely victory. Lewis and Piller took a quick 2-up lead and maintained their cushion through 12 holes before Icher began rolling in big putts as Europe won holes 13, 14 and 16 to snatch the win.

“It was a tough game at the beginning; they gave nothing,” said Icher. “But the door opened on the 13th and 14th, and we took it. It’s a great feeling now.”

After Thompson hit her drive on the par-four first hole to six feet and Kerr rolled in the eagle putt, it looked grim for Europe against the top U.S. team, but Reid and Hull battled back to lead 2-up with two to play.

Kerr and Thompson then showed their grit, as a par on 17 and an impressive birdie on 18 enabled them to level the opening foursomes match.

Kang and Salas were cruising, 2-up at the turn and still 2-up with two to play, but required a clutch putt on the final hole from rookie Kang to secure Team USA’s win over Ciganda and Masson.

The Women of Midnight,"The works are stark and replete with pathos, such as The Prey, three paintings which depict how women were turned into objects, meant to be distributed between India and Pakistan. The works are stark and replete with pathos, such as The Prey, three paintings which depict how women were turned into objects, meant to be distributed between India and Pakistan.

Seven decades after the Partition, an Indian-origin artist, settled in London, is shedding light on the suffering of women who bore the brunt of one of the darkest chapters of Indo-Pak history. Kanwal Dhaliwal, a graduate from Government College of Art, Chandigarh, with roots in Punjab, has created a series of painting in oils and acrylics, titled “The Partition”.

“Do you think it were the Hindus, Muslims or Sikhs who were the victims of the Partition? No, the women of both countries were the worst sufferers as their identities changed overnight, many were forced to commit suicide as their families wanted to get rid of them. I have tried to bring out their pain on canvas in this series,” says

the artist.

The works are stark and replete with pathos, such as The Prey, three paintings which depict how women were turned into objects, meant to be distributed between India and Pakistan. “Raped, murdered, forcefully married, converted, molested and thrown in the heaps of corpses like unclaimed luggage on both sides of the border. ‘Indian’ women overnight turned into a ‘Hindu’ wife or a ‘Muslim’s sister, displaced and abandoned by their own families in the name of honour,” says the artist.

In another painting, a representation of the land in the form of a woman lies on the ground, bare chested and with a dagger bearing the flag of Great Britain on it. The sharp end is bloodstained as the dagger pierces through the chest, dividing a mother into two parts. The border line is blood red.

In the The Carnage, an undivided Punjab is swept through by three stakeholders — Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. On the top is the British Empire, as fields of gold and the glistening white cotton crop shows the prosperous Punjab of the time, waiting to be butchered. “It illustrates the death and decay of Punjab at the hands of not only the British but its own people who turned perpetrators,” says 56-year-old Dhaliwal.

With the backdrop of the UK flag, a woman half dressed in the colours of saffron (India) and green (Pakistan) lies in a pool of blood in Punjab. In another painting, she lies helplessly on the border, while words such as azadi in Hindi and Urdu stare at her from the right and left, respectively. “Not the whole of India, it was Punjab which actually got partitioned. For almost a decade now, I have been reading and researching on the many aspects of the Partition. But sadly, people don’t want to talk about what our women went through at the time. So, I decided to work on this series,” he says.

Dhaliwal, who taught art at a school in Chamba for seven years before moving to the UK, says that his works have been influenced by the writings of Saadat Hasan Manto and Ishtiaq Ahmed.

“The most detailed and authentic work I have read on Partition is The Punjab Bloodied, Partitioned and Cleansed: Unravelling the 1947 Tragedy through Secret British Reports and First-Person Accounts by Ahmed, who has documented minute details,” says Dhaliwal.

He has also worked on a series, The Valiant Ones, which included portraits of prominent personalities from India and Pakistan. As for showcasing a series such as this in the UK, Dhaliwal says there are no constraints on artistic freedom. “I cannot expect the British government to acknowledge my work, but people do. My work is a truthful expression of what actually happened and people from India, Pakistan and the UK are appreciating it,” says the artist.

"Lebanese army, Hezbollah declare offensives on Islamic State at Syrian border","The Lebanese army operation got underway at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT), targeting Islamic State positions near the town of Ras Baalbek. (File Photo) The Lebanese army operation got underway at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT), targeting Islamic State positions near the town of Ras Baalbek. (File Photo)

The Lebanese army launched an offensive on Saturday against an Islamic State enclave on the northeast border with Syria as the Lebanese Shi’ite group Hezbollah announced an assault on the militants from the Syrian side of the frontier. The Lebanese army operation got underway at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT), targeting Islamic State positions near the town of Ras Baalbek with rockets, artillery and helicopters, a Lebanese security source said. The area is the last part of the Lebanese-Syrian frontier under insurgent control. The operation by Hezbollah and the Syrian army targeted the area across the border in the western Qalamoun region of Syria.

A Hezbollah statement said the group was meeting its pledge to “remove the terrorist threat at the borders of the nation” and was fighting “side by side” with the Syrian army. It made no mention of the Lebanese army operation. The army said it was not coordinating the assault with Hezbollah or the Syrian army. Any joint operation between the Lebanese army on the one hand, and Hezbollah and the Syrian army on the other would be politically sensitive in Lebanon and could jeopardize the sizeable U.S. military aid the country receives. Washington classifies the Iran-backed Hezbollah as a terrorist group.

“There is no coordination, not with Hezbollah or the Syrian army,” General Ali Kanso said in a televised news conference, adding that the army had started to tighten a siege of IS in the area two weeks ago. “It’s the most difficult battle so far waged by the Lebanese army against terrorist groups – the nature of the terrain and the enemy,” he said, characterizing the 600 Islamic State fighters in the area as 600 “suicide bombers”. In a recent speech, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Lebanese army would attack Islamic State from its side of the border, while Hezbollah and the Syrian army would simultaneously assault from the other side. A commander in the military alliance fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad said that “naturally” there was coordination between the operations.

TIES WITH DAMASCUS

Last month, Hezbollah forced Nusra Front militants and Syrian rebels to leave nearby border strongholds in a joint operation with the Syrian army.

The Lebanese army did not take part in the July operation, but it has been gearing up to assault the Islamic State pocket in the same mountainous region. Footage broadcast by Hezbollah-run al-Manar TV showed the group’s fighters armed with assault rifles climbing a steep hill in the western Qalamoun. Lebanese President Michel Aoun was following the army operation, called “Jroud Dawn”. “Jroud” refers to the barren, mountainous border area between Lebanon and Syria.

Hezbollah has provided critical military support to President Bashar al-Assad during Syria’s six-year-long war. Its Lebanese critics oppose Hezbollah’s role in the Syrian war. Northeastern Lebanon was the scene of one of the worst spillovers of Syria’s war into Lebanon in 2014, when Islamic State and Nusra Front militants attacked the town of Arsal. The fate of nine Lebanese soldiers taken captive by Islamic State in 2014 remains unknown.

Shi’ite Hezbollah and its allies have been pressing the Lebanese state to normalise relations with Damascus, challenging Lebanon’s official policy of neutrality towards the conflict next door.

U.S. President Donald Trump called Hezbollah “a menace” to Lebanon and the region during a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri in Washington last month, and promised continued U.S. support for the Lebanese army

Did you know that Colombia has an ‘all-inclusive sex resort’?,"A brothel in Colombia has expanded into an all-inclusive sex resort. (Source: Mike Becker/YouTube) A brothel in Colombia has expanded into an all-inclusive sex resort. (Source: Mike Becker/YouTube)

Who wouldn’t want to take a break from all the hustle-bustle of everyday work and go MIA for two days? Even better, imagine leaving all your worries behind and getting to live in a luxury resort, no less. What if we say along with all the plush extravagance you will find at your beck and call in this luxurious stay, you will find just another amenity at this specific luxury stay in Colombia? What amenity? Sex. You heard us!

In what is already creating ripples and controversies across the world, a brothel in Colombia has expanded into an all-inclusive sex resort. Known as the Good Girls Sex Resort, their website goes into great details and calls it the “first all-inclusive erotic resort in Cali Columbia”. “Good Girls Colombia is the first all inclusive erotic resort in Cali Colombia. An amazing resort with private villas and the most beautiful Colombian women. A discreet and beautiful environment for men to fulfill their wildest fantasies,” the website proudly proclaims.

According to the website, other than gorging on delicious food and availing all the other facilities that a luxury stay provides, Good Girls’ Sex Resort also offers to change people’s “fantasies into reality”. “Good Girls is a resort where you are attended by the most beautiful Latin women, who will be your guardian angels for as long as you decide,” they claim. But if privacy and security of identity is what is keeping you from considering this, then the resort has that taken care of too.

The resort assures that they prioritise your safety and privacy as long as you stay there and guarantee “absolute discretion” of the details of your trip at the resort.

The packages that one can avail at the resort ranges from Overnight Package to Gold Package. For $599, a deluxe room, airport transportation, bilingual host and “1 Girl Overnight” are the amenities that you can avail under the Overnight Package and for $1499, you can avail services like “2 Girls 24 hours, executive villa, all meals, 1 spa pass” among others under the Gold Package.

Prostitution is known to be legal in Colombia, under the condition that it is carried out in designated “tolerance zones”. Reasons like poverty and displacement due to financial restraints have resulted in prostitution becoming widespread and rampant in the country.

We think it’s bizarre, but probably at a time when people are in a rush to make flourishing careers leave them with no time to nourish relationships, could this be what many would rather opt for? Let us know what you think in the comments’ section below.

US Senator John McCain completes first round of radiation and chemotherapy,"Senator John McCain arrives for a Senate Republican meeting after being diagnosed with brain cancer.

US Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who was diagnosed with brain cancer in July, has completed his first round of radiation and chemotherapy, his daughter said on Friday. “His resilience & strength is incredible,” Meghan McCain, who is a host on the Fox News program “Outnumbered,” wrote on Twitter about her father. “Fight goes on, here’s to small wins.”

McCain, 80, who is known for his political independence during three decades in the Senate representing Arizona, was found to have an aggressive form of brain tumor, glioblastoma, after surgery in July for a blood clot above his left eye. Doctors have said his treatment options include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.

McCain has said that he would receive treatment in Arizona. Last month, McCain cast the deciding “no” vote on the Senate floor against a bill to repeal key elements of the healthcare law known as Obamacare. With that vote, the bill was defeated, 51-49, dealing President Donald Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell a crushing political setback.

"J&K special status: In Supreme Court, an old matter back in a new context","The present challenge to Article 35A in the Supreme Court is based on the ground that it could have been introduced in the Indian Constitution only through a constitutional amendment under Article 368, and not through a Presidential Order under Article 370. (File photo) The present challenge to Article 35A in the Supreme Court is based on the ground that it could have been introduced in the Indian Constitution only through a constitutional amendment under Article 368, and not through a Presidential Order under Article 370. (File photo)

Article 370, a part of the Indian Constitution when it came into force on January 26, 1950, provided that only two articles — Article 1, which defines India, and Article 370 — will apply to Jammu & Kashmir. Article 370 also mandated that other provisions of the Constitution can apply to J&K, “subject to such exceptions and modifications as the President may by order specify”, with the concurrence of the state government and the endorsement of the J&K Constituent Assembly. In 1969, the Supreme Court ruled that the President can issue an Order under Article 370 only with the concurrence of the state government.

The first such Presidential Order was issued on January 26, 1950. This was replaced by another Presidential Order (the ‘mother’ order), which applied several provisions of the Indian Constitution to J&K with substantial changes, amendments and provisos. While applying to J&K the provisions of Part-III of the Indian Constitution, which relates to Fundamental Rights, the 1954 Presidential Order introduced Article 35A, which protected laws passed by the state legislature regarding Permanent Residents from any challenge on the ground that they were in violation of the Fundamental Rights.

The present challenge to Article 35A in the Supreme Court is based on the ground that it could have been introduced in the Indian Constitution only through a constitutional amendment under Article 368, and not through a Presidential Order under Article 370. This is an argument that the Supreme Court has rejected on at least three occasions earlier.

Read | Broken vows, court wars on ‘special status’

# In 1961, a five-judge Constitution Bench in Puranlal Lakhanpal vs The President of India and Others held that when, through an order under Article 370, the President applies any provision of the Indian Constitution to J&K, the term “modification” must be considered in its “widest possible amplitude”. It will not be limited to making only partial changes to the provision, but will include the power to “extend” and “enlarge” the constitutional provision, including making a “radical transformation”.

# In 1969, another five-judge Bench reaffirmed this view in Sampat Prakash vs State of Jammu & Kashmir.

# Finally, on December 16, 2016, in State Bank Of India vs Santosh Gupta And Anr. Etc., a two-judge Bench of the court followed the two earlier Constitution Bench decisions to reiterate that the Presidential Order can “extend” or “enlarge” the provisions of Indian Constitution in its application to J&K.

The constitutional validity of Article 35A is, therefore, well established. It protects legislation passed by the J&K legislature relating to benefits to Permanent Residents from challenge on the ground of violation of Fundamental Rights, while extending the chapter on Fundamental Rights of the Indian Constitution to J&K. In that sense, this provision is in the nature of a proviso to the extension of the chapter on Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution to J&K. In fact, the Fundamental Rights were extended to J&K through the 1954 Presidential Order.

Therefore, if the court were to accept the petitioners’ argument challenging Article 35A, the extension of the Fundamental Rights and every other provision of the Indian Constitution to J&K through consecutive Presidential Orders (all amendments to the 1954 mother order) will cease to apply. Only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution will then apply to J&K.

Read | Seventy years on, digging a deeper hole in Kashmir

Again, in Sampat Prakash (1969), the Supreme Court held that Article 368 of the Indian Constitution, which requires approval by a two-thirds majority in Parliament to amend the Constitution, does not directly apply to J&K. The court held: “Article 368 is not primarily intended for amending the Constitution as applicable in Jammu and Kashmir, but is for the purpose of carrying the amendments made in the Constitution for rest of India into the Constitution as applied in the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Even in this process the powers of the President under Article 370 have to be exercised.” Thus, any amendment to the Indian Constitution (done under Article 368) will apply to J&K only if such amendment is extended to the state by a Presidential Order under Article 370.

If the legal challenge to Article 35A is to succeed, the Supreme Court would have to undo the constitutional law on the subject over the last six decades, as well as the application of a large number of provisions of the Indian Constitution to J&K.

This is why it appears that the challenge to Article 35A — effectively the last remnant of J&K’s special status — is primarily political and its fate, too, will be decided politically. The other way for the Centre to remove J&K’s special status will be to get the state government’s concurrence to a fresh Presidential Order to remove Article 35A. To secure such concurrence will not be easy.

"‘Iraq begins battle to retake Tal Afar, Islamic State bastion near Mosul’","In this Nov. 20, 2016 file photo, Popular Mobilization Units fighters ride on the back of a truck on their way to fight against Islamic State militants in the airport of Tal Afar, west of Mosul, Iraq. (AP Photo/Felipe Dana, File) In this Nov. 20, 2016 file photo, Popular Mobilization Units fighters ride on the back of a truck on their way to fight against Islamic State militants in the airport of Tal Afar, west of Mosul, Iraq. (AP Photo/Felipe Dana, File)

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced early on Sunday the start of a battle to retake Tal Afar, a key Northern Iraqi bastion of the Islamic State (IS) group and one of their last remaining strongholds in the region. The announcement comes a month after the capture by Iraqi forces of second city Mosul further east in a major blow to the jihadists.

In a televised speech, Abadi, dressed in military uniform and standing in front of an Iraqi flag and map of the country, announced “the start of an operation to free Tal Afar”. “I am saying to Daesh that there’s no choice other than to leave or be killed,” he said, using an alternative name for IS. “We have won all our battles, and Daesh have always lost,” he said, telling the country’s troops that “the entire world is with you.”

Tal Afar is located 70 kilometres (43 miles) west of Mosul, where US-backed government forces ended jihadist rule in July after a months-long battle. In June 2014, IS jihadists overran Tal Afar, a Shiite enclave in the predominantly Sunni province of Nineveh, on the road between Mosul and Syria.

At the time it had a population of around 200,000, but local officials said it was now impossible to know the exact number still living inside the city as most are cut off from the outside world. However, authorities have accused the approximately 1,000 jihadists in the city of using civilians as human shields during Iraqi and coalition air strikes earlier this week in preparation for the ground assault.

Abadi said that Iraq’s paramilitary Hashed al-Shaabi forces would help various army, police and counter-terrorism units in Tal Afar.

The umbrella organisation, which is dominated by Iran-backed Shiite militias, has already been fighting to retake a number of other Iraqi cities from the Islamic State. “In the early hours, the guns and flags turned towards their targets,” said Ahmed al-Assadi, a spokesman for Hashad. “Victory is near” in Tal Afar, an “Iraqi city taken hostage and humiliated for years by attacks from these barbarians,” he said.

IS overran large areas north and west of Baghdad in 2014, but Iraqi forces have since regained much of the territory. Once Tal Afar is retaken, Iraqi authorities intend to launch a fight to retake jihadist-held Hawija, in the province of Kirkuk, 300 kilometres north of Baghdad. Jihadists still hold areas in Anbar, a western province that faces major security challenges.

IS, which declared a cross-border “caliphate” encompassing swathes of Iraq and Syria three years ago, has also suffered major setbacks in Syria, where around half of IS’s de facto Syrian capital Raqa has been retaken by US-backed fighters. But divisions across political, religious and ethnic lines will again rise to the surface in Iraq after the extremist group is driven out of its last bastions, experts have said.

"Barcelona terror attack: Police arrest fourth suspect, death toll rises to 14","Barcelona terror attack: Children, some in tears, are escorted down a road in Barcelona, Spain on Thursday. (AP Photo) Barcelona terror attack: Children, some in tears, are escorted down a road in Barcelona, Spain on Thursday. (AP Photo)

Police officials have said the attacks in Catalonia were being prepared “for some time” from Alcanar, situated in South of Barcelona. The announcement comes after they made a fourth arrest in relation to the attacks, Reuters reported. No details were divulged regarding the same. The death toll in Barcelona terror attack rose to 14 on Friday as a woman succumbed to her injuries in Cambrils. On Thursday evening, a van rammed into a crowd of people in one of Barcelona’s most popular tourist spots, Las Ramblas, injuring over a 100. The Islamic State took responsibility for the attack, which is being touted as one of the deadliest terror attacks Spain has witnessed in the past decade. The dead and injured are from over 34 countries, including France, Germany, Pakistan and the Philippines.

Spain began three days of mourning as hundreds of people gathered in Placa de Catalunya, city’s central square, on Friday to observe a minute of silence in the memory of the victims. Spain’s King Felipe, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and President of the Generalitat of Catalonia Carles Puigdemont were also present. People also laid down cards, candles and flowers at the site of the attack. Defiant crowds later on chanted, “I am not afraid” in Catalan, Reuters reported.

(Reuters)

Hours after the attack was carried out at around 5.30 pm (local time) on Thursday, Catalan police gunned down the five suspects in an extensive anti-terror operation foiling another assault bid. The alleged terrorists were killed in an encounter in Cambrils in an operation which wounded five civilians and a police officer. According to Reuters, the attackers ran them over in a car before being killed. The police claimed that the attackers were carrying bomb belts, which were later detonated by the bomb squad, adding that the Cambrils incident was linked to the van attack in Barcelona. Police also linked the van attack to an explosion which killed one, injured seven and destroyed a house in Alcanar, which is about 200km from Barcelona.

The attacks have been condemned by many leaders across the world, including French President Emmanuel Macron. Spain’s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called it a “jihadist attack” while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said “terrorism can cause us bitter and deeply sad hours, as has happened in Spain, but it won’t defeat us.” She said the Foreign Ministry is still working with Spanish authorities to say whether any Germans were among the victims. In a message to the cardinal of Barcelona, Pope Francis said the attack was “an act of blind violence that is a grave offence to the Creator”. Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said the attack showed the European Union’s system of migrant relocation was wrong. “It is dangerous. Europe should wake up,” he said. “We are dealing here with a clash of civilisations.”

On Thursday, a white van plowed into people, pulling back and forth in order to hurt as many as possible. According to reports by The Associated Press, people walk down a wide, pedestrianized path in the middle of the street, while the vehicles can travel on either side. Witnesses informed media that the van was also moving from side to side while crashing into people as the historic city was full of tourists.

In a statement posted on the Amaq news agency, Islamic State’s media arm, the group took responsibility for the attacks. “The perpetrators of the Barcelona attack are soldiers of the Islamic State and carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting coalition states.” The claims are yet to be verified.

As a part of the US-led coalition fighting against the terror outfit, Spain has sent several hundred soldiers to Iraq to train the local forces in battling against the extremist organisation. The soldiers are themselves not involved in ground operations, Reuters reported.

Social media was full of videos showing people running for cover and being knocked over by the van. Visuals of bodies lying on the floor and people attending to the injured also emerged as Catalan police soon cordoned off the street and shut down the stores.

“People were shouting and we heard a bang and someone cried that it was a gunshot … Me and my family ran into the restaurant along with around 40 other people. At first people were going crazy in there, lots of people crying, including a little girl around three years old,” a British tourist told Reuters.

Top US general reaffirms commitment to Japan amid North Korea tensions,"US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (Source: AP Photo/File) US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (Source: AP Photo/File)

The top US general restated Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to the security of its close Asian ally, Japan, on Friday amid regional tensions over North Korea, telling his counterpart in Tokyo that “an attack on one is an attack on both of us”. Fears about North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons programmes have grown in recent weeks. Pyongyang has said it was considering plans to fire missiles over Japan towards the US Pacific territory of Guam, although North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appears to have delayed the decision.

US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and their Japanese counterparts agreed at a meeting in Washington on Thursday to work more closely on North Korea. “The most important thing it (the ministers’ meeting) did was reaffirm the primacy of our bilateral relationship here in Asia-Pacific,” US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford said at the start of a meeting with the Chief of Staff of Japan’s Self-Defence Forces, Admiral Katsutoshi Kawano.

“This is a very important time for security in the region and of course we are mostly focused on the threat coming out of North Korea,” Dunford said. “I think we have made it clear to North Korea and anyone else in the region that an attack on one is an attack on both of us.”

Tillerson said in Washington the United States wanted dialogue with Pyongyang, but only if it were meaningful.

“Our effort is to cause them to want to engage in talks but engage in talks with an understanding that these talks will lead to a different conclusion than talks of the past,” he said.

In 2005, North Korea reached an agreement with six countries to suspend its nuclear programme in return for diplomatic rewards and energy assistance but the deal later collapsed.

Tensions have risen after North Korea conducted two missile tests in July which, like its five atomic bomb tests, were carried out in defiance of international pressure and United Nations resolutions. US President Donald Trump has vowed not to allow North Korea to develop nuclear missiles that could hit the US mainland but Pyongyang sees its nuclear arsenal as protection against Washington and its partners in Asia.

The new US Ambassador to Japan, William Hagerty, said he had arrived at a difficult time and the United States wanted to work with Japan to “calm the rhetoric” over North Korea. “Our alliance is rock solid, in fact in my personal view this is the greatest alliance on earth,” he said as he met Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday.

“FIRE AND FURY”

Dunford said on Thursday the United States and South Korea would go ahead with joint military drills next week despite pressure from North Korea and its main ally, China, to halt the contentious exercises that Pyongyang routinely describes as preparation for war. North Korea has fired missiles and taken other steps in response to the war games in the past.

Trump warned North Korea last week it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States, prompting North Korea to say it was considering plans to fire missiles towards Guam. Both sides have since tempered their rhetoric somewhat, but with North Korea’s military capabilities growing, Japan has been looking to strengthen its defences.

The Japanese defence ministry wants to introduce a land-based missile defence system called “Aegis Ashore” to address North Korea’s missile threats and has decided to seek funding in the next fiscal year to cover the system design costs, a Japanese defence official told Reuters. “We will absolutely help and what’s most important for ballistic missile defence is that we integrate our capabilities,” Dunford said.

Foreign Minister Taro Kono said in Washington Japan would strengthen its defence posture in response to the North Korean threat and provide $500 million to help boost maritime security in East Asia, where China has been pursuing extensive maritime claims that have angered regional neighbours.

Japan is likely to increase its defence spending at a faster pace in its next five-year plan from April 2019 than the annual 0.8 percent average rise in its current mid-term plan, the Nikkei business daily reported on Friday. Defence officials have said such a rise was desirable but finance ministry officials are cautious because of Tokyo’s mammoth public debt.

North Korea has repeatedly threatened to target Japan, which hosts around 54,000 US military personnel, as well as South Korea and the United States with its missiles.

The United Nations approved tough new sanctions against North Korea earlier this month in response to its missile tests, which include a ban on North Korean seafood exports. China, North Korea’s largest trading partner, has vowed to enforce the new sanctions, as it has done with previous imposts, and says it is ready to pay the price.

State-run Chinese newspaper the Global Times said on its website late on Thursday that authorities in the Chinese border city of Hunchun were negotiating with North Korea about the fate of seafood trucks stuck between the two countries’ customs ports. “The seafood that can’t enter China is ready to be gradually shipped back to North Korea,” a Hunchun official told the paper.

"For Sri Lanka, World Cup direct qualification on the line against India","Sri Lanka’s captain Dinesh Chandimal (File) Sri Lanka’s captain Dinesh Chandimal (File)

Not very long ago, home venues used to be fortresses for Sri Lanka and international fixtures were always well-attended. Things, however, have changed. The humiliating 3-2 home series loss against Zimbabwe was followed by a 3-0 Test whitewash by India. Little wonder then that home fans seem to have started to lose interest, as empty stands during the recently concluded Test series would confirm. The ODIs, commencing in Dambulla on Sunday, are expected to be better attendance-wise — all the more because the hosts have a lot to play for in this five-match series.

The ODI series loss against Zimbabwe has put Sri Lanka under pressure in terms of direct qualification for the 2019 World Cup. In a ten-team World Cup, seven top-ranked side, along with hosts England, will gain direct entry. The bottom four side in the ICC rankings will play a qualifier with the associates and top-two teams from the event will go to the World Cup. The cut-off date for direct qualification is September 30 and these are Sri Lanka’s last ODI assignments before that.

Sri Lanka are currently placed at No. 8 in the ICC rankings with 88 points, 10 points clear of their nearest rivals West Indies. But the West Indies will play a one-off ODI against Ireland and five ODIs against England from September 19 to 29. A clean sweep will take them to 88 points, while Sri Lanka’s points will come down to 86 if they lose 5-0 against India. Even a 4-1 defeat will see them fall behind the West Indies, provided the Caribbeans win all their matches. Sri Lanka will have to win at least two matches against India to secure direct qualification to the 2019 World Cup, because in that case they will finish with 90 points.

As per the ICC ratings, a lower-ranked team earns more points by beating a higher-ranked opponent. Similarly, the lower the opponents’ rating, more a team is penalised for losing to them. In the ODI and T20 international rating systems, each game is rated as a standalone event. India are currently ranked third in the ODIs with 114 points. They need a 4-1 series victory for status quo and not falling behind England.

Sri Lanka had been sitting pretty on 98 points just four months ago. Since May they have lost 10 ranking points. The series lost against Zimbabwe – their first against a lower-ranked side at home – alone cost them five rating points. Angelo Mathews, then Sri Lanka captain, had described that as “one of the lowest points” of his career. Just a few days ago, Sri Lanka’s Test skipper Dinesh Chandimal, too, spoke about how the Test series hiding against India was one of the worst of his career, but that’s history now. The very fact that the hosts can’t afford to fail miserably could make the one-dayers interesting.

Sri Lanka are always more comfortable in limited-overs cricket and they can take inspiration from their excellent seven-wicket win against India at the Oval in the Champions Trophy. Danushka Gunathilaka and Kusal Mendis’ 159-run second wicket partnership saw off a steep chase. Gunathilaka has returned for the ODIs after suffering an injury in the first Test against India. Mendis looked impressive at times, scoring a century in the second Test. But recalling all-rounders Thisara Perera and Milinda Siriwardana suggests that Sri Lanka want to fall back on experience, with the World Cup qualification at stake.

Perera was dropped after the Champions Trophy. Siriwardana’s last ODI was against Bangladesh in April. And Lasith Malinga will be there, maybe with the added motivation to prove his sports minister wrong.

Mathews to bowl

That Mathews can bowl a few overs is an option boost for the hosts. The former skipper had stopped bowling after he suffered a hamstring tear in January. “I don’t think I can bowl the full quota of overs but I will definitely be bowling. If I bowl the full quota, I might not be able to play the full series. So I need to manage my workload,” he was quoted as saying by a local newspaper. The team’s new captain, Upul Tharanga, would obviously like to have the services of someone, albeit part-time, who has accounted for 111 scalps in 187 ODIs.

US: Border agents track drone from sky to drugs on the ground,"Authorities say agents found Rivera with the methamphetamine in a lunch box and a 2-foot (0.6-meter) drone hidden in a nearby bush.

A 25-year-old US citizen has been charged with using a drone to smuggle more than 13 pounds (5.9 kilograms) of methamphetamine from Mexico by drone, an unusually large seizure for what is still a novel technique to bring illegal drugs into the United States, authorities said Friday.

Jorge Edwin Rivera told authorities that he used drones to smuggle drugs five or six times since March, typically delivering them to an accomplice at a nearby gas station in San Diego, according to a statement of probable cause. He said he was to be paid $1,000 for the attempt that ended in his arrest.

Border Patrol agents in San Diego allegedly saw the drone in flight on Aug. 8 and tracked it to Rivera about 2,000 yards (1,830 meters) from the Mexico border. Authorities say agents found Rivera with the methamphetamine in a lunch box and a 2-foot (0.6-meter) drone hidden in a nearby bush.

The US Drug Enforcement Administration said in a recent annual report that drones are not often used to smuggle drugs from Mexico because they can only carry small loads, though it said they may become more common. In 2015, two people pleaded guilty to dropping 28 pounds (12.7 kilograms) of heroin from a drone in the border town of Calexico, California. That same year, Border Patrol agents in San Luis, Arizona, spotted a drone dropping bundles with 30 pounds (13.61 kilograms) of marijuana.

Alana Robinson, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California, said drones haven’t appealed to smugglers because their noise attracts attention and battery life is short. Also, payloads pale compared to other transportation methods, like hidden vehicle compartments, boats or tunnels.

As technology addresses those shortcomings, Robinson expects drones to become more attractive to smugglers. The biggest advantage for them is that the drone operator can stay far from where the drugs are dropped, making it less likely to get caught. “The Border Patrol is very aware of the potential and are always listening and looking for drones,” Robinson said.

Benjamin Davis, Rivera’s attorney, declined to comment. Rivera is being held without bail and is scheduled to be arraigned September 7.

Two years ago, India traveled to Sri Lanka for the a three-match Test series.

But, the team made a comeback in the second and third Test to win both the games and series 2-1.

The current series will be important for India as this is the first assignment for new head coach Ravi Shastri and his support staff. He took charge of the team after Anil Kumble decided to step down owing to differences with captain Kohli."

"Rajasthan govt will provide reservation, if deprived classes unite: BJP MLA","BJP Rajasthan MLA, Ghanshyam Tiwari BJP Rajasthan MLA, Ghanshyam Tiwari

BJP MLA Ghanshyam Tiwari on Sunday said that the Rajasthan government will provide reservation to deprived classes of the society, only if they unite and fight for their rights. “The day Brahmins, Rajputs, Vaishys and Kayasthas join hands, the government will issue a reservation notification,” he said in a statement in Jaipur. “The state government is ready to introduce a Bill in the Assembly to provide reservation to Gujjars and four other castes.

“But doesn’t want to release a notification of the Bill already passed in the Assembly meant to provide reservation to the economically backward of upper castes,” the outspoken BJP leader said. Deprived classes are not getting the benefit as they do not gather members of the society to build pressure on the government, he claimed.

“We are not against reservation for people of other castes, but fighting for reservation to the people of deprived classes that are economically backward,” Tiwari said. Citing the example of gangster Anandpal Singh’s encounter, he claimed that initially the government was not ready to get it probed by the CBI, but was compelled to do so when the Rajput community built pressure.

Tiwari has been criticising Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and the BJP leadership after show cause notices were served to him by the party’s national discipline committee in May. The notices were sent after the BJP MLA alleged that the BJP’s Rajasthan unit had become a place for the “mafia and sycophants” and claimed that the dedicated, loyal and qualified people were being “sidelined”.

Rahil Gangjee continued to be the best-placed Indian at tied 10th after turning in an eventful two-under 70 in the third round of the Fiji International golf tournament in Fiji on Saturday.

He was five shots off the pace with a total of five-under 211, behind Australian Wade Ormsby (66) who grabbed the outright lead by one shot Natadola Bay Championship Golf Course.

The 37-year-old Ormsby, who claimed his career breakthrough on the Asian Tour in 2013, put himself in prime position for a second title after moving atop the leaderboard with a three-day total of 10-under 206 at the Natadola Bay Championship Golf Course.

Trump has not shown ‘competence’ needed to lead nation: Corker,"“Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the president said there were very fine people on both sides. There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen,” he said in a statement. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) “Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the president said there were very fine people on both sides. There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen,” he said in a statement. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)

A powerful Republican Senator has questioned the competency of Donald Trump saying that he has not demonstrated the “stability” or “competence” necessary to effectively lead the country, days after the president made controversial comments about the racist violence in Virginia.

Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he fears the nation will be in peril unless Trump makes radical changes at the White House.

“The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,” Corker told reporters after a townhall in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Corker’s remains gains significance given that once he was considered for vice presidential position by Trump and also for that of the secretary of state after his elections.

As a chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tennessee plays a key role in shaping US’ foreign policy.

“We should hope that (Trump) aspires that he does some self-reflection, that he does what is necessary to demonstrate stability, to demonstrate competence, to demonstrate that he understands the character of our nation and works daily to bring out the best of the people in our nation,” Corker said.

Democratic Congressman Anthony G Brown said that Trump is unfit for office.

“Donald Trump is unfit for office. His despicable actions this week have confirmed that he lacks the moral fortitude to be the leader of the free world and simply cannot be trusted to preserve, protect and defend our Constitution against all threats, foreign and domestic. I will vote in favour of censure, and call on Congressional Republicans to take meaningful action to rein in this Administration,” he said.

Brown said that Trump’s response to the savage actions of white supremacists and extremists in Charlottesville and his convoluted and distorted rationalisation of the murder of Heather Heyer, is “shameful and unbecoming of the president of the US”.

“He lacks a basic understanding of and appreciation for our nation’s values, as well as of the history of the struggles and sacrifices that have been made by generations of Americans to perfect our imperfect nation,” he said.

Trump, just completing seven months in the White House, is under fire for his response to Saturday’s clashes between far-right and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which he blamed “both sides” for the violence.

The rally was in protest at the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War.

In a related development, Congressman Steve Cohen, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, announced that he will be introducing articles of impeachment against President Trump following his controversial comments about the racist violence in Virginia.

“I have expressed great concerns about President Trump’s ability to lead our country in the Resolution of No Confidence that I introduced in July with 29 of my colleagues; however, after the president’s comments on Saturday and again on Tuesday in response to the horrific events in Charlottesville, I believe the president should be impeached and removed from office,” Cohen said.

“Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the president said there were very fine people on both sides. There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen,” he said in a statement.

Cohen is the third Democratic lawmaker to file articles of impeachment against Trump. The other two being Al Green and Brad Sherman.

Meanwhile Tony Schwartz, co-author of the 1987 bestselling ‘Art of the Deal’ predicted that Trump will soon resign from presidency.

“The circle is closing at blinding speed. Trump is going to resign and declare victory before Mueller and congress leave him no choice,” he said in a tweet.

“Trump must be isolated. Resistance every day. The end is near but must keep pressure high,” tweeted Schwartz, who had made similar prediction in May during controversy over firing of FBI Director Robert Mueller.

Runners to defy odds in today’s marathon,"THE IDBI Federal Life Insurance half marathon on Sunday is expected to see some of its participants defying various odds. The second edition of this event will witness the participation of Khushroo Patel, Amarjeet Singh Chawla and Shibani Gulati — each with a story to tell.

Chawla, 61, had lost his sight at the age of 40. This will be his 71st marathon.

“At every marathon, I need an escort to hand-hold me till the finishing point. There are times when I have to pay the registration fees of the escort too, but that has never stopped me from participating in marathons. Moreover, I have noticed that visually impaired participants are given much more importance at marathons. That is always a plus”, said Chawla.

His only form of training for a marathon is spot-jogging, which he does every day, in addition to a few breathing exercises and yoga.

Shibani Gulati, who underwent a kidney transplant in 2010, first signed up for a 3-km Dream Run in 2012. Since then, she said, there has been no looking back. A fitness enthusiast, she trains five days a week to put her best foot forward during marathons.

Even her medical condition has failed to act as a deterrent. “I am very fortunate to have got another shot at life. I am determined to use it to the fullest and constantly break the norms set by the society for the people who have undergone a kidney transplant,” said Gulati.

For 77-year-old Khushroo Patel, marathons have become a way of life. “I first participated in a marathon at the age of 47, with minimal practice. Then I practiced hard and won many laurels. The constant desire to participate keeps me going,” she said.

Ernesto Valverde’s advice to Barcelona: ‘Overcome and above all not look back’,"Ernesto Valverde urged his players to begin La Liga season with no doubts. (Source: Reuters) Ernesto Valverde urged his players to begin La Liga season with no doubts. (Source: Reuters)

Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde called on his players to look beyond the gloomy atmosphere around the team as they begin their Liga season against Real Betis at home on Sunday.

Barca’s preparations for the campaign have been thrown into chaos by the departure of Brazilian forward Neymar to Paris St Germain for a world record fee. They have also been left without Luis Suarez for a month after the Uruguayan hurt his knee in Wednesday’s 2-0 Spanish Super Cup defeat by Real Madrid.

The loss at the Santiago Bernabeu sealed a 5-1 aggregate win for Real, prompting defender Gerard Pique to remark that he felt inferior to Madrid for the first time in a decade.

New signings Paulinho, Gerard Deulofeu and Nelson Semedo have been met with a lack of enthusiasm from supporters, while efforts to prise Brazilian playmaker Philippe Coutinho away from Liverpool have so far been unsuccessful, leading to concerns that Barca are lagging behind champions Real heading into the new season.

“With respect to Suarez’s injury, these things can happen, while losing to your biggest rival is always a problem and a disappointment,” Valverde said in a news conference on Saturday.

“The departure of Neymar was sudden, unexpected and has changed the script for us. We all need to work in the same direction, but in a different way. These are obstacles that we need to overcome and above all not look back.”

The coach said Pique could play against Betis after recovering from a thigh strain, while Andres Iniesta was still unavailable through injury.

He also said Brazil international Paulinho, who was unveiled on Thursday after completing a 40 million euro ($47 million) move from Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande, needed more time to adapt before playing for his new side.

Sunday’s game at the Nou Camp has taken on extra significance after Thursday’s deadly attacks in Barcelona and the coastal town of Cambrils, which killed at least 14 people and left more than 100 injured.

“It’s an extraordinary and awful situation and we show our absolute solidarity with the victims of the two attacks,” Valverde said.

“Yesterday was a difficult day. These things put all the small problems we face in our lives everyday into perspective.”

A minute’s silence will be held before the game, as in every fixture in Spain’s top two divisions this weekend, while Barca’s players will wear “Barcelona” on the back of their shirts instead of their names as a tribute to the victims.

Iraqi forces start offensive to take back Islamic State held city of Tal Afar,"An Iraqi special forces soldier stands guard while displaced Iraqis flee their homes, as Iraqi forces battle with Islamic State militants. (Source: Reuters) An Iraqi special forces soldier stands guard while displaced Iraqis flee their homes, as Iraqi forces battle with Islamic State militants. (Source: Reuters)

Iraqi security forces launched on Sunday an offensive to take back the city of Tal Afar, their next objective in the US-backed campaign to defeat Islamic State (IS) militants, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said. “You either surrender, or die,” Abadi said in a televised speech announcing the offensive, addressing the militants.

A longtime stronghold of hardline Sunni insurgents, Tal Afar, 50 miles (80 km) west of Mosul, was cut off from the rest of the Islamic State-held territory in June.

The city is surrounded by Iraqi government troops and Shi’ite volunteers in the south, and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in the north. About 2,000 battle-hardened militants remain in the city, according to US and Iraqi military commanders. Islamic State’s self-proclaimed “caliphate” effectively collapsed last month, when US-backed Iraqi forces completed the takeover of the militants’ capital in Iraq, Mosul, after a nine-month campaign.

South Korean arrested for duping Thais into sex trade,"A South Korean man accused of duping over 20 Thai women into forced prostitution in his home country has been arrested in Bangkok, an officer said today.A South Korean man accused of duping over 20 Thai women into forced prostitution in his home country has been arrested in Bangkok, an officer said on Saturday.

Kim Hyoung Joon, 39, is believed to be part of a transnational gang funnelling Thai women into the sex trade in South Korea, and his arrest follows efforts by Bangkok and Seoul to dismantle the group.

Thai police said Joon promised women jobs as masseuses in South Korea. But upon their arrival they were instead forced into sex work by pimps who seized their passports and blocked any attempts at escape. “More than 20 women have been lured by this gang over the past two to three years,” said Songsak Raksaksakul, the deputy director of Thailand’s Department of Special Investigations (DSI). “Most of the victims are between 25 and 40 years old,” he added.

Joon was arrested at his Bangkok apartment on Thursday and charged with human trafficking. Thai and South Korean authorities are coordinating to track down a woman who they believe was Joon’s Thai accomplice and has fled to a neighbouring country.

In February, South Korean police arrested eight other suspects and rescued several Thai victims. Thailand is a notorious source, destination and transit hub for human trafficking operations that shift vulnerable women, men and children into sex work and other forms of forced labour.

In May, US authorities charged 21 people, including 10 Thai nationals, for running an international criminal enterprise that trafficked hundreds of Thai women into brothels across America.

Supreme Court orders setting up of IIT-NEERI team to tackle Mithi pollution,"AFTER REPRIMANDING the state government for “poor management” of the Ulhas and Waldhuni rivers, the Supreme Court has now pulled it up for not doing enough to eliminate pollution from the Mithi river.

In an order dated August 16, the court directed that a joint team be set up by the directors of IIT-Powai and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur, to look into the pollution of Mithi river. The order emphasised on making efforts to avoid the occurrence of another flood like the one in 2005.

The team will also look into the steps taken by the state and the government authorities to eliminate the pollution.

The court added that despite the July 26, 2005, floods in Mumbai, which claimed over 1,000 like, “no effective steps appear to have been taken by anybody in the state of Maharashtra, including some of the statutory authorities, to remedy the situation in spite of the fact that a little more than 12 years have gone by.” As per the court order, the directors of the two organisations will nominate experts for the team, who will then prepare a report on the extent of damage caused to the Mithi river and decide the future course of action accordingly. The report has to be presented in court within three months. The court has also sought the Maharashtra government or the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) to deposit an amount of Rs 50 lakh in the Supreme Court Registry within two weeks. The money will be used by the joint committee.

Satish Gavai, additional chief secretary in the Department of Environment of the Government of Maharashtra and the secretary of the SEIAA, has been appointed as the convenor of the Committee.

In 2014, city NGOs — Jalbiradri and Vanashakti — had approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) with regard to the degradation of the Mithi river. Last year, the tribunal had imposed a Rs 25-lakh fine on Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Development Authority for “causing environmental degradation” while widening of the river. Seeking relief, the MMRDA had then approached the apex Court. The matter will next be heard on October 10, 2017.

North Korea accuses Japan of planning cyberspace war,"North Korea Flag (File) North Korea Flag (File)

North Korea accused Japan of building a cyberspace attack force in its military under the pretext of self-defence, the media reported.

Official newspaper Rodong Sinmun on Saturday said the Japanese Defence Ministry is planning to boost the size and capability of its cyber unit under the excuse of self-defence against hackers. The members of the cyber unit will be drastically increased and a department for specializing in cyber attack capability will be set up, Xinhua news agency reported.

“Their cyber unit is not for merely protecting the computer system of the Self-Defence Forces (SDF) from hacking, but for attacking the computer systems of its rivals,” said the newspaper, adding that once the unit has the capability to attack, the SDF will “completely turn into the force in attack formation”.

“If they are engrossed in war hysteria for re-invasion (of the Korean peninsula) while talking about the improvement of the so-called attacking capability, far from drawing a lesson from their crimes-woven past history, they will follow in the footsteps of their defeated predecessors,” it said.

The Japanese Defence Ministry was mulling increasing the number of soldiers in its cyber defence unit from the current 110 to 1,000, and a new working group to study cyber warfare techniques will also be established, according to media reports last month.

The initiative is part of the Japanese government’s plan to boost its cyber defence capabilities ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Call it a boring choice all you want, but in this day and age when we carry our phone chargers with more diligence than a water bottle, power banks are a saviour. Also, remember the number of times the line went dead just when you were coming to the interesting bit of your story because your friend’s phone ran out of charge? Remember how that hurt?

We all have that one friend who really, really wants a pet. And though gifting a pup or a kitten is a great idea, it is also a lot of work that said friend may not be equipped to handle. So start with something simpler and stationary, maybe? Gift a plant and let them get into the habit of watering it everyday. If you see they are doing fine, get them the pup they have been eyeing for next year.

"Anirban Lahiri still in with a chance at Wyndham Champiopnships, lies 11th","Lahiri had a ‘horror start’ with bogey-bogey, but picked well on the back nine, that included an eagle on par-5 15th and closed with a birdie on 18th. (Source: Express Archive) Lahiri had a ‘horror start’ with bogey-bogey, but picked well on the back nine, that included an eagle on par-5 15th and closed with a birdie on 18th. (Source: Express Archive)

Anirban Lahiri recovered from a bad start to card two-under 68 on the third day of the Wyndham Championships in Greensboro.

Lahiri, who dropped from overnight Tied-9th to Tied-11th, is now 11-under in the PGA Tour’s last regular-season event of the season.

Lahiri is still five shots behind the leader, Henrik Stenson (66), who kept his nose ahead of Kevin Na (65), Ollie Schneiderjans (66) and Webb Simpson (68). Stenson is 16-under, while the threesome following him is at 15-under.

Lahiri had a ‘horror start’ with bogey-bogey, but picked well on the back nine, that included an eagle on par-5 15th and closed with a birdie on 18th. Overall he had three birdies and an eagle against three bogeys.

“That was a good bad round after a horror start,” said Lahiri. “I missed a lot of fairways, more than I have this week. I was out of position few time and made errors in strategy.”

He added, “There were a couple of pin position, where I will hit differently, when I come here next time as will, to make an easy four like on the first. Those couple of shots were due to lack of knowledge of the course. I didn’t hit my fairway metals well, but hit the driver good. That birdie on 18th was good.”

He sounded confident about the final round.

“I am close to putting it all together and I can go low. I didn’t lose too much ground but on this track, no one is going backward. I would have liked to be 13 or 14 under. “It will be interesting to how course is set if it rains like it did last night. I still think there could be a chance if I go real low on Sunday,” he said.

Stenson, the 2013 FedExCup champion and The Open winner in 2016, shot 66 and was at 16-under 194 at Sedgefield with a round left.

Simpson had sole possession of the lead late in the round, before Stenson caught him during his birdie binge on the back nine.

The Swede pulled even with Simpson with birdies on four of five holes, a run he capped by sticking his second shot on the par-4 17th some 10 feet from the hole and converting that putt.

He could have ended his round with another one, but pulled his 15-foot birdie putt wide right and settled for par.

Marko Arnautovic apologises to West Ham fans after red card,"Marko Arnautovic apologised to fans after receiving a straight red card. (Source: Reuters) Marko Arnautovic apologised to fans after receiving a straight red card. (Source: Reuters)

West Ham’s record signing Marko Arnautovic apologised to fans after receiving a straight red card in their 3-2 Premier League defeat at Southampton on Saturday.

The 28-year-old Austrian was dismissed with West Ham already a goal down in the 33th minute for elbowing Jack Stephens. Although Arnautovic initially disputed the decision, holding his hands up in the air in feigned surprise, TV replays showed he clearly made contact with the Saints defender.

“I want to apologise to all of the West Ham fans. Just want to let you know that I didn’t want to let my team down and you fans. A big apology to you all,” he later posted on social media. The sending off left West Ham playing a man down for most of the game although they still managed to come back from a two-goal deficit before eventually going down 3-2 to a last-gasp penalty. The defeat, following last week’s 4-0 drubbing at Manchester United, piles pressure on manager Slaven Bilic, who refused to reveal what he said to Arnautovic after the game.

“It is a big blow because you have to play with 10 men for a big part of the game,” he said. “We have spoken about everything and that will stay inside the dressing room.”

Last season Arnautovic was also sent off against Southampton while playing for Stoke City, who sold him to West Ham for around 24 million pounds ($30.89 million).

The defeat overshadowed a double from Javier Hernandez, the Mexican’s first goals for West Ham since his 16 million pound move from Bayer Leverkusen.

"‘It’s worth it’, Floyd Mayweather on putting legacy on the line","Floyd Mayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime. (Source: AP) Floyd Mayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime. (Source: AP)

With his superfight against Conor McGregor a little over a week away, Floyd Mayweather struck a reflective tone on Thursday as he discussed the risk of coming out of retirement for a massive payday.

Mayweather, who has not fought in nearly two years, needs a win next week to surpass Rocky Marciano’s record and reach 50-0 for his career, while McGregor, who is making his professional boxing debut, is 21-3 in mixed martial arts.

“When a fighter has lost before, if he loses again they say ‘oh, it’s nothing, he’s lost before,'” Mayweather told a conference call. “But when a fighter has been dominating for 20-some years and never lost, everything is on the line.

“My legacy. My boxing record. Everything is on the line.” The fight, which the two combatants promoted with a four-city international media tour stretching across three countries, has garnered plenty of interest despite skepticism about how competitive it will be.

Mayweather, a master defensive technician, and tactician is heavily favoured to win the Aug. 26 fight in Las Vegas but the 40-year-old has said that, on paper, everything leans toward the 29-year-old Irishman, who is taller and has a longer reach.

Mayweather acknowledged the physical demands of training for a fight had become much harder on his body than when in his prime, but said he did not let negative thoughts enter his mind.

“I try not to think about losing or taking the ‘L.’ That’s not really my focus. Every day I tell myself I am a winner. I was born to be a winner at life. Not just in the ring but I was born to be a winner,” said Mayweather.

“It’s all about taking risk. I wouldn’t be where I’m at if I didn’t take risks so I don’t mind putting a 49-0 record on the line, putting everything on the line for this fight. I feel like it’s worth it.”

Mayweather may be far from his prime but feels his sheer experience in the ring will carry him through what he says will be his last fight, one that is expected to be the most lucrative event in the history of combat sport.

“I don’t think that I’m the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 21 years ago. Of course not,” he said. “I don’t think that I’m the same Floyd Mayweather that I was 10 years ago. I’m, not even the same Floyd Mayweather that I was I was five or two years ago.

“But I still have a high IQ in that ring. And experience wise, it leans towards me, period, because I have been in the ring at such a high level for so long.”

Amit Shah to pitch for backward classes to strengthen Tamil Nadu BJP,"BJP National Preisdent Amit Shah. (PTI Photo) BJP National Preisdent Amit Shah. (PTI Photo)

BJP president Amit Shah is likely to meet leaders representing backward and most backward classes as part of efforts to strengthen the party in Tamil Nadu during his three-day visit to the state from August 22. Shah will be addressing leaders of backward classes from diverse backgrounds in Chennai on August 22. Also, their viewpoints on key issues and grievances, if any, will be heard and these will be taken to a logical conclusion, party sources said.

The move assumes significance in the backdrop of the Centre’s Constitutional Amendment Bill, providing constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes which is now with the Rajya Sabha Select Committee. Also, in the Tamil Nadu’s perspective, uplift of Scheduled Castes, tribes, backward, most backward and other marginalised classes has always been important.

Both the AIADMK and DMK, dominant players in the state, have given top priority to it in their political narrative. Against such a background, sources said, the push for the growth of backward classes by Shah was coming at the right time after a similar exercise by the party in respect of SCs.

In 2015, Amit Shah had met Scheduled Caste groups in Madurai during his Tamil Nadu visit. He had at that time endorsed their demand for the nomenclature of Devendrakula Vellalar for them. Later, a delegation of such SC groups had called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had assured them that their demand will be considered positively.

Strengthening the basic party unit at the booth level will be a key focus during Shah’s visit, the sources added. Shah will hold discussions with office-bearers of a booth committee at Nadukuppam, which is primarily a neighbourhood of fishermen on August 23. He is also scheduled to have breakfast at the residence of a grassroots level office-bearer at Nadukuppam.

“We will replicate Shah ji’s model to strengthen our booth committees based on his interactions with our office bearers at Nadukuppam,” a party leader said, adding the top leader’s visit was primarily to strengthen the party’s organisational apparatus.

Out of about 65,000 booths in Tamil Nadu, BJP says it has presence in about 40,000 booths with functional committees. Shah is also likely to meet professionals like those working in the IT sector during his visit to Coimbatore on August 24. Also, some leaders from other political parties may join the BJP in his presence.

Shah is also likely to address the media on August 23, according to his tentative schedule. He will arrive on August 22, leave for Coimbatore on August 23 evening, and leave for Delhi from there on August 24.

BJP MP Anurag Thakur on Sunday alleged that the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh had “ignored” the cause of the common man and was working for its own benefits and welfare. “The Congress is a divided house and would be ousted from the political scenario of the state and the country,” he said during a Tiranga Rally at Pucca Bharo at Hamirpur. The yatra passed through various parts of the town with BJP supporters carrying the tricolour.

“The state government is ignoring the cause of the common man and running for its own benefits and welfare,” he said.

He said that the youth had to perform their duties in the coming assembly and general elections and alleged that the Congress was once again trying to divide the nation on caste and creed lines.

Thakur said that such yatras would be taken out in all parts of India and in Himachal Pradesh.

Building blocks: A novel which speaks of the ground reality of being an architect,"Author Sangeet Sharma. (Express Photo) Author Sangeet Sharma. (Express Photo)

“BEING AN architect is tough,” admits Sangeet Sharma, architect, poet, teacher, author, musician.who delves into the journey of professional practice through his novel, Castles in the Air: Misadventures of a Profession. Released on Saturday evening at the UT Guest House, Sangeet opens the novel with a prologue to the book, “Architecture is one hell of a profession.” Though a work of fiction, the novel, says the author, speaks of the ground reality of being an architect. The book, a satire on architecture, is written by someone who knows the “brutalities of life in architecture and life itself”.

The frustration of dealing with clients and their general distrust with architects, unprofessional contractors and suppliers, the lackadaisical attitude of the education system, in the novel, it all gets reflected through the protagonist, who goes through the pain of the profession. “I have followed the writing style of A&D i.e. Appear and Disappear, where different characters in different milieu of this professional journey play their part in that particular segment or chapter and leave, and yes, it is replete with humour,” explains Sangeet, an award-winning architect, who has to his credit five books on architecture. Many, he adds, may not agree with the depiction of the professional pangs. But, in the real world of architecture, a creative professional may find oneself stifled, about which Sangeet writes in the epilogue, “We are immortalised along with our buildings.”

From life in architecture college to interesting observations about the many layers of architecture, the book also highlights Sangeet’s love for the profession as he read out from the book and also gave an absorbing audio-visual presentation, highlighting the many humorous aspects of the novel. “There are many disappointments, too, for you are expected to cater to demands you may not believe in, the traps of any profession,” commented Sangeet, adding the book is about real people and an interesting mix.

The book, adds the author, is not for architects alone; it is for clients who initiate jobs establishing worthy projects. It is for builders and contractors who execute them; it is for the craftsmen and the masons, who, by the dexterity of their hands, create magic in detail. It is for the services consultants and allied engineers who ensure the smooth functioning of the buildings. It is for the sculptors, painters and artists who induce art into architecture. It is for the students of architecture who will be in the profession in time to come and should be well-prepared to face the challenges ahead.

Agreed renowned and respected architect S D Sharma, Sangeet’s father, commenting how Chandigarh has only a small group of architects and the need of the hour is better interaction among them to understand what’s happening in the field. “One quality that an architect must possess is the art of writing, to talk about the world of architecture. The book is replete with wit and makes one think of our profession, what we do and our experiences in the profession. You feel the book is about you and it will motivate you. It’s hard and painful when you have to suppress your creativity and I feel architects must have the courage to do projects that they believe in,” summed up Sharma.

Islamic State claims stabbing attack in Russia,"Police work on the site of a knife attack in the center of Surgut, Russia, on Aug. 19, 2017. (Xinhua/Sputnik/IANS) Police work on the site of a knife attack in the center of Surgut, Russia, on Aug. 19, 2017. (Xinhua/Sputnik/IANS)

The Islamic State (IS) terrorist group has claimed responsibility for a knife attack that left seven persons injured in the Russian city of Surgut, media reports said. “The attacker in the Russian city of Surgut is an Islamic State soldier,” the group said via its official Amaq news agency on Saturday. Russian authorities have not commented so far, Xinhua news agency reported.

A man, who apparently stabbed passersby on the street at random, was shot dead by police. The attack happened at about 11.20 a.m. The injured were taken to hospital and two of them were in a critical condition, the state-owned RIA Novosti news agency reported.

Russia’s Investigations Committee said it had identified the attacker and was checking his psychological history. He was a local resident born in 1994, it said. No motive has been established yet. A criminal case has been launched, and investigators are verifying information on the attacker’s mental disorders, the committee said.

UK looking to stop ‘malicious’ use of rented vehicles after Spain attacks,"Police officers stand at a road block at the beginning of fiestas in Bilbao, Spain August 19, 2017, after a van ran down pedestrians in Barcelona’s Las Ramblas on Thursday. Police officers stand at a road block at the beginning of fiestas in Bilbao, Spain August 19, 2017, after a van ran down pedestrians in Barcelona’s Las Ramblas on Thursday.

Britain is exploring ways of stopping the “malicious” use of hired vehicles, including looking at what more rental companies can do, the transport ministry said on Sunday, after two attacks in Spain killed 14 people. The attacks – one in Barcelona where a van was driven into crowds, killing 13 people, and another in Cambrils that saw five men drive a vehicle along a walkway, killing a woman – echoed tactics that have been used by Islamist militants in London.

The police say that the use of hired vehicles makes such attacks very hard to prevent. “The threat from terrorism is changing and so must our response. That is why we are reviewing our counter-terrorism strategy and powers and why we have ploughed extra resources into counter-terrorism,” a government spokesperson said.

“The Department for Transport is also working with the police and the vehicle rental industry to explore what more can be done to prevent the malicious use of hire vehicles. This includes looking at what more rental companies could do before an individual can hire a vehicle.” Britain has increased the number of barriers at bridges and in certain locations in city centres to try to prevent such attacks. Since March, Britain has seen four attacks, three involving a vehicle deliberately driven at pedestrians.

British hire firms make various checks before granting a vehicle rental, including verifying that customers have a full driving licence, additional identification and a valid credit card. Similarly, Italy’s Interior Ministry over the weekend instructed its local officials to begin to track truck rentals. The ministry wants each heavy vehicle hire to be communicated to local police.

Ashok Bajpai joins Uttar Pradesh BJP,"Ashok Bajpai (centre) joins BJP in presence of Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Kalraj Mishra, in Lucknow on Saturday. Express Ashok Bajpai (centre) joins BJP in presence of Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Kalraj Mishra, in Lucknow on Saturday. Express

Samajwadi Party founder member Ashok Bajpai joined the BJP on Saturday, taking the total number of former MLCs, who had resigned within the last month from the House, to do so to five.

Former SP MLCs Sarojini Agrawal, Bukkal Nawab and Yashwant Singh, and Thakur Jaiveer Singh, formerly a BSP MLC, joined the ruling party earlier.

Deputy CM and BJP state president Keshav Prasad Maurya, who was presenting during Bajpai’s induction at the party state headquarters in Lucknow, claimed that more senior leaders from SP and BSP may join BJP in coming days.

“BJP will work to strengthen itself. It is responsibility of SP, BSP and Congress to strengthen their respective organsiations. Our party is working in a direction to strengthen the base of BJP,” he added. Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Kalraj Mishra too were present at the occasion.

Several other SP leaders and their supporters, known loyalists of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Singh Yadav, too accompanied Bajpai to join BJP. They include former national president of Samajwadi Vyapar Sabha, Hulas Rai Singhal and former state president of SP women wing, Shweta Singh. Former BSP in-charge for Gujarat state Munshilal Jayant too joined BJP Saturday.

Although the resignations could be an opportunity to pave the way for Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma and ministers Swatantra Deo Singh and Mohsin Raza to the state upper house (they are not member of either the Assembly or Legislative Council at the moment), sources said the BJP may re-elect a few of them to the Legislative Council next year.

Israeli PM Netanyahu to meet Russian President Putin over ‘recent development’ in Syria,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Amir Cohen, Pool via AP/Files) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Amir Cohen, Pool via AP/Files)

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia next week to discuss “recent development” in Syria. A statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office on Saturday said the meeting will be held in Black Sea city of Sochi on Wednesday, Xinhua news agency reported.

The two leaders are expected to talk about the recent development in Syria, where Russian forces are fighting along with President Bashar Assad’s military, the statement said. The meeting would be held amid Iran’s alleged increasing presence in the war-torn country. “It should be noted that over the past two years, Prime Minister Netanyahu has met President Putin once in every few months to discuss bilateral and regional issues to prevent friction between Israeli and Russian air forces in Syria,” the statement read.

Head of Israel’s Mossad national intelligence agency Yossi Cohen warned last week against “Iranian expansion” into the regions that the Islamic State has relinquished in the Middle East. “The areas where IS presence is decreasing, Iran is working to fill the void,” Cohen said.

According to the intelligence chief, Iran is expanding through its proxies and local allies in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. Israel worries that Iran will deploy its forces near the Syrian border with Israel, creating an Iranian stronghold next to the Jewish state.

Netanyahu has called on Russian and US leaders to contain Iranian presence in Syria in the framework of a possible cease-fire to end the eight-year-long civil war.

Israel has repeatedly declared it will not intervene in the fighting in Syria. However, Israel’s military responds to the random fire from Syria with artillery or airstrikes on posts of the Syrian army.

English Premier League managers back transfer window change,"The English Premier League season began on August 11 with the lower divisions kicking off a week earlier. (Source: AP) The English Premier League season began on August 11 with the lower divisions kicking off a week earlier. (Source: AP)

Premier League clubs will vote next month on a proposal to ensure the transfer window closes before the season starts, with the plan already winning the backing of several managers.

A vote will take place at the Premier League shareholders meeting on September 7 and clubs from the lower divisions in the English Football League are set to follow suit next month.

Currently, the window closes on the last day of August but the Premier League season began on August 11 with the lower divisions kicking off a week earlier.

Burnley manager Sean Dyche said the current system can seriously disrupt the work of a manager and his team. “You don’t want to start the season and lose three of your players when you’re three games into the season. That could be really hard to take. And that happens,” he said.

“So I think if you could get that done as well, it means that once the football starts, the managers, coaches and teams can just get on with the football.

“And the fans. They can just get on with what they really want to be looking at, and that is football matches.” Last week, Burnley sold striker Andre Gray to Watford three days before their opening game.

Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp, Swansea boss Paul Clement and Stoke’s Mark Hughes are among those who have backed a change. “From a manager’s point of view, I would be in favour of the window closing before the season starts because of the disruption it causes,” Hughes said on Friday.

West Ham United’s Croatian manager Slaven Bilic supports the idea but has highlighted one potential pitfall to a change — the risk of a different window deadline from European leagues.

“For me it has to be across the leagues. Otherwise, there is no point,” he said. “Ironically, it would put the clubs in a worse situation that you would still lose players if clubs abroad want them and you can’t replace them. It would only protect us in that no other Premier League clubs can take your players.

“The (Philippe) Coutinho situation, it would not stop Liverpool losing him but would stop them finding a replacement. It’s a great idea, first one I’m definitely like ‘yes’. Some teams are losing like 30 percent of their teams.”

Woman held for employing 13-yr-old,"The owner of a dog shelter was arrested here on Saturday for allegedly keeping a 13-year-old boy for cleaning and other purposes. The boy, who hails from Bihar, was rescued a few days ago by officials of Child Labour Department and was found to have several injury marks of dog bites on his body.

Following a compliant lodged by Child Labour Department, police arrested Sapna Sharma from her Adarsh Society residence under Juvenile Justice Act. She was produced before the court and was released on bail.

“Sharma had brought the minor from Bihar to get his job, after consulting his parents. The minor was earlier afraid of dogs and had many dog bite injuries. His condition is now normal. We will talk to the father of minor and enquire how much Sharma was paying to the minor’s parents,” said Inspector G A Sarvaiya.

The teenager was admitted to New Civil Hospital for the treatment of allergies and bite injuries. Sharma had taught him dog and kennel maintenance after which he used to take care of 35 to 40 dogs.

Flood damage: Rail link to Assam will not be repaired before August 28,"A damaged railway line in flood-hit Katihar district. (PTI Photo) A damaged railway line in flood-hit Katihar district. (PTI Photo)

The railway link to Assam and the Northeastern region, which was damaged at several places due to floods in Bihar on August 12, is not likely to be repaired soon, with railway authorities here saying that full connectivity cannot be restored before August 28. “As per engineering estimate, full connectivity cannot be restored before August 28. Northeast Frontier Railway has bore the brunt of flood fury and many locations in its network still remain breached in Kishanganj, Katihar and Araria districts of Bihar. However, restoration work is being carried out on war footing in all locations,” NF Railway CPRO Pranav Jyoti Sharma said.

The railway authorities however have begun loading of essential commodities for the Northeastern region at Kishanganj railway station in Bihar from where the items will move to various parts of the region.

For passengers travelling from the Northeast to other destinations in India, the railways have provided special trains from Dibrugarh and Guwahati to Dalkhola in North Bengal, from where passengers can travel by road to Raiganj for onward journey, the CPRO said.

“As the track between Dalkhola and Raiganj continues to remain breached (till bridge no 133 is restored) passengers can avail bus service between these two stations which are located close to the four-lane National Highway,” CPRO Sharma said. Meanwhile, three more deaths were reported Saturday, taking the taking the toll in this year’s floods in the state to 153. One death each was reported from Dhubri, Morigaon and Golaghat districts.

"Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump will not attend Kennedy Center Honors: White House","The White House said the president and first lady would not take part in the Kennedy Center Honors “to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction.” (AP/File) The White House said the president and first lady would not take part in the Kennedy Center Honors “to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction.” (AP/File)

U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will not attend the Kennedy Center Honors in December, the White House announced on Saturday, after several honorees said they would boycott a White House reception before the show. The Kennedy Center also said in a statement the White House reception “will no longer take place.” The White House said the president and first lady would not take part in the Kennedy Center Honors “to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction.”

The announcement came after television producer Norman Lear, singer Lionel Richie and dancer Carmen de Lavallade said they would not attend the White House reception that was set to take place prior to the Dec. 3 annual gala event. The other honorees are singer Gloria Estefan and rapper LL Cool J. The awards are presented each year in December to recognize honorees for their lifetime contributions to the arts. All five honorees are expected to attend a Dec. 2 dinner and awards ceremony at the State Department, the Kennedy Center’s chairman, David Rubenstein, and its president, Deborah Rutter, in a statement.

The Kennedy Center “respects” the decision made by the Trumps, they said. “In choosing not to participate in this year’s Honors activities, the administration graciously signaled its respect for the Kennedy Center and ensures the Honors gala remains a deservingly special moment for the honorees,” Rubenstein and Rutter said. De Lavallade, an African-American actress, dancer and choreographer, said in a statement on her website that she was honored to receive the award and would attend the show.

But, she said that she would not go to the White House “in light of the socially divisive and morally caustic narrative that our existing leadership is choosing to engage in.” Her comments come after the president blamed “both sides” for violence that erupted last week between counter-demonstrators and neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and white nationalists holding a “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va.

Trump’s comments prompted a slew of resignations from presidential councils, including all 17 members of the President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. In a New York Times article on Aug. 3, Lear was quoted as saying that he would forgo the White House reception because, “This is a presidency that has chosen to neglect totally the arts and humanities — deliberately defund them — and that doesn’t rest pleasantly with me.”

The Kennedy Center Honors is the second annual Washington event that Trump decided not to attend. The president, who called the U.S. news media as “enemies of the American people,” also withdrew from the annual White House Correspondents Dinner.

Syrian President Bashar Assad rejects security cooperation with the West,"Syrian President Bashar Assad. (File/Photo) Syrian President Bashar Assad. (File/Photo)

Syrian President Bashar Assad refused any security cooperation with Western nations or the reopening of their embassies, until they cut ties with opposition and insurgent groups. Shortly after Assad gave his speech on Sunday, a shell hit the first international fair in the country since the war began six years ago, killing and wounding several people. Assad’s defiant comments come at a time when his troops and pro-Iranian militiamen are gaining ground across the country under the cover of Russian airstrikes. Many countries have ceased calling for him to step down.

Speaking before dozens of Syrian diplomats in Damascus, Assad praised Russia, Iran, China and Lebanon’s Hezbollah for supporting his government during the conflict.

He said Syria will look east when it comes to political, economic and cultural relations.

“The direct support of our friends, politically, economically and militarily, made our advance on the ground greater and the losses of war less. Therefore, they are our partners in these achievements on the road to crush terrorism,” Assad said.

“Let’s be clear. There will be no security cooperation nor opening of embassies or even a role for some countries that say that they want to play a role in ending the crisis in Syria before they clearly and frankly cut their relations with terrorism,” Assad said. “At that point maybe we can speak about opening embassies.”

The Syrian crisis began in March 2011 with a peaceful uprising against Assad’s government, later escalating into a full-fledged civil war after a brutal government crackdown and the rise of an armed insurgency. The conflict has since killed an estimated 400,000 people and displaced half the country’s population.

In the early years of the conflict, many Western and Arab countries called on Assad to step down, and both the U.S. and the European Union have imposed sanctions on his government. Several Arab and Western countries also withdrew their diplomats from Damascus.

But after the Islamic State group declared a caliphate in large parts of Syria and Iraq, the international focus turned to crushing the extremists, who have planned attacks around the world that killed and wounded hundreds of people.

The Syrian president said his country’s economy is turning to growth again “at a very slow pace, although we are under an almost complete embargo.”

Assad said that hardly a week passes without an attack in the West, referring to assaults carried out by IS supporters. “These facts are what forced them (the West) to change their stance,” Assad said.

He welcomed recent deals to de-escalate violence in Syria, but vowed not to give the opposition in politics what it failed to gain through arms.

The de-escalation zones in central, northern and southern Syria were proposed in a plan approved in May by Russia, Turkey and Iran in the Kazakh capital, Astana. The plan included a cessation of hostilities, a halt to Syrian government air raids over designated areas, and provisions for humanitarian aid access.

Despite that deal, Assad said Syrians don’t trust Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and that the Syrian leader does not consider him to be a guarantor. Erdogan’s government is a main backer of Syrian rebels, and sent troops into Syria a year ago to battle IS and to halt the advance of Kurdish forces. Those troops, and allied Syrian forces, now control a stretch of Syrian territory along the border.

“Any Turkish citizen who is in Syria without permission from the Syrian government will be considered an occupier,” Assad said.

"Sharad Yadav holding parallel JD(U) meet, Nitish decides to join NDA at the Centre","Nitish Kumar at the JD(U) meeting in Patna. PTI photo Nitish Kumar at the JD(U) meeting in Patna. PTI photo

The JD(U) national executive chaired by Nitish Kumar on Saturday decided to formally join the NDA at the Centre, even as in a parallel meeting held elsewhere in Patna, party rebel Sharad Yadav declared he was sticking with the opposition Grand Alliance in Bihar. The JDU(U) national executive resolution paves the way for representatives of the party to join Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Council of Ministers in New Delhi. At a meeting with Nitish in the capital over lunch on August 11, BJP president Amit Shah had invited the JD(U) to join the NDA at the national level.

“JD(U) president Nitish Kumar approved a resolution to become part of the NDA. The national executive also put its seal of approval on the Bihar JD(U)’s unit decision to walk out of the Grand Alliance with the RJD and Congress and join hands with the BJP to form a government in Bihar,” party general secretary and its principal spokesperson K C Tyagi said after the meeting at 1 Anne Marg, the chief minister’s residence in Patna.

Yadav, who skipped the national executive despite being invited, attended a parallel event, Jan Adalat, at Patna’s Sri Krishna Memorial Hall along with some party leaders loyal to him, including the suspended Rajya Sabha MP Ali Anwar Ansari, suspended former minister Ramai Ram and suspended general secretary Arun Srivastava. Also Read: Nitish Kumar targets Sharad Yadav, asks why didn’t he stop JD(U) split from NDA in 2013

“Let anyone change their path. I have not changed my path. People will decide in future whose path is the right path,” Yadav said. Leaders at the event vowed to continue with the Grand Alliance.

Tyagi said the JD(U) had not split. “71 MLAs out of 71 are with Nitish Kumar, 30 out of 30 MLCs are with Nitish Kumar and 16 of the 19 office bearers whose names were finalised with the consent of Sharad Yadav at an earlier meeting presided by Nitish Kumar are with Nitish. Even then there is a split? I want to make it clear that there is no split in JD(U),” Tyagi said.

The national executive took no decision on action against Yadav. Tyagi said the party would wait until August 27, the day the RJD has called a “BJP Bhagao Desh Bachao” rally in Patna. Yadav is set to attend the rally; should that happen, the JD(U) will begin the process to terminate his Rajya Sabha membership, leaders close to Nitish said.

Supporters of the rival JD(U) factions clashed briefly outside the residence of the chief minister. Speaking at an open session after the party meeting, Nitish took a jibe at Lalu Prasad over the alleged Bhagalpur Srijan scam, reported by The Indian Express on Saturday and in this edition. “It is good that even those people who were criticising the CBI are now demanding a probe by the CBI.” Lalu had assailed the CBI after the recent cases against his children.

“I always say that the Earth is fully equipped to meet all our needs, but not our greed. What is this tendency to earn do number ka paisa (ill-gotten wealth)?” Nitish asked.

It was his government that had brought the Bhagalpur scam in the public domain, Nitish said, adding that “nobody will be spared”. Sources close to Sharad Yadav said he is looking beyond Bihar to forge wider opposition unity, and that his home state Madhya Pradesh could be his first stop. Farmer suicides and agrarian distress have led to farm agitations in Mandsaur in MP and Maharashtra, both BJP-ruled states, Yadav’s first campaign could begin from Indore, the sources said.

The Yadav camp has said it will approach the Election Commission to stake claim over the party name and arrow symbol; however, the case of the Samajwadi Party, in which the Commission backed Akhilesh Yadav against party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav after most MLAs, MPs and office-bearers said they were loyal to the then UP chief minister, is likely to dampen spirits.

Yadav has ruled out joining Lalu’s RJD, dismissing the suggestion as “canard” spread by forces opposed to him, even as leaders close to Nitish have repeatedly attacked him over “cosying up to Lalu’s party”.

Crystal Palace look to Christian Benteke to exploit Liverpool defence,"Christian Benteke (L) has scored five times in three league matches at Liverpool as an opposition player. (Source: Reuters) Christian Benteke (L) has scored five times in three league matches at Liverpool as an opposition player. (Source: Reuters)

Crystal Palace are hoping their former Liverpool striker Christian Benteke will be able to exploit the Anfield club’s perceived defensive weakness from set pieces in Saturday’s Premier League game.

The powerful Belgian has scored five times in three league matches at Liverpool as an opposition player, including two when Palace won there in April.

Meanwhile Liverpool conceded three goals at Watford last weekend and were widely criticised for defensive laxity.

“Christian showed his importance last season,” the Palace manager Frank de Boer told a media conference on Friday.

“Hopefully he can do that again for us. We know set pieces are important, they’re important to all teams in the Premier League.”

The London side began the season with a shock 3-0 home defeat by promoted Huddersfield Town in the Dutchman’s first league game as manager since replacing Sam Allardyce in the close-season.

“Hopefully the negative impact of the 3-0 loss is gone,” De Boer added. “It will be a difficult game at Liverpool but we’ll do our best. Liverpool are very dangerous in attack. Juergen Klopp has selected the players to capitalise on winning the ball in key areas.”

Palace, who will be without the injured forward Wilf Zaha, have an excellent recent record at Liverpool and if they can pull off an upset would become the first visiting team to win four successive matches there in the top flight for over 80 years.

Last season’s 2-1 win followed other victories by 2-1 and 3-1 in the preceding seasons.

"Rahil Gangjee finishes tied 20th, Shubhankar Sharma tied 24th at Fiji Open","Gangjee, who was in the running for a top-10, had three bogeys and two birdies in his 72. (Source: Express photo) Gangjee, who was in the running for a top-10, had three bogeys and two birdies in his 72. (Source: Express photo)

Rahil Gangjee rounded off the week at the Fiji International with an even par 72 and finished in tied 20th place in Fiji on Sunday.

Gangjee fell from 10th overnight. The other Indian who made the cut, Shubhankar Sharma, shot a second successive 69 to finish tied-24th, up from 36th.

Gangjee, who was in the running for a top-10, had three bogeys and two birdies in his 72, while Sharma shot a bogey free 69.

Australian Jason Norris kept his cool to sign for a closing five-under-par 67, claiming the biggest victory yet in his 21-year professional career with a convincing four-shot win at the tri-sanctioned Fiji International.

The 44-year-old Norris, who was thinking of quitting the game a few years ago, revived his career after firing eight birdies against three bogeys to cap a winning total of 14-under-par 274 at the Natadola Bay Championship Golf Course.

Norris takes home a winner’s prize purse of USD 195,421 and moved to seventh place on the Asian Tour Order of Merit, courtesy of his victory at the AUD 1.5 million (approximately USD 1.14 million) event.

Young Thai talent Jazz Janewattananond fired the week’s lowest round score of 64 to grab a share of second place alongside Australian duo of David McKenzie and James Marchesani, who closed with rounds of 67 and 70 respectively.

Overnight leader Wade Ormsby of Australia battled to a 73 to finish five shots back in fifth place with compatriots Adam Bland (65), Daniel Pearce (69) and Peter Wilson (70) in the event tri-sanctioned for the first time by the Asian Tour, European Tour and the ISPS HANDA PGA Tour of Australasia.

Before ODI call-up I thought it might be time to focus on forging a career in T20s: Nathan Coulter-Nile,"Earlier, Nathan Coulter-Nile dislocated his right shoulder while fielding for Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash League. (Source: AP file) Earlier, Nathan Coulter-Nile dislocated his right shoulder while fielding for Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash League. (Source: AP file)

Australian fast bowler, Nathan Coulter-Nile has revealed that he was considering quitting the longer format of the game to pursue a career in the shortest format of the game. Coulter-Nile has had a string of injury problems due to which he was considering options of being a T20 player. But with the recent call-up in the ODI series, Coulter Nile is now focussed on the game.

Speaking to Seven West Media, he said, “I lost my Australian contract and Greg Chappell came on as a selector (in a new role) and we all know he’s got a big youth focus. I was having a good IPL at the time so I thought I could probably just do this. I thought it might be time just to focus on forging a career in T20s.

On reflection and thinking about it and speaking to JL (Justin Langer) and blokes like that, I just thought I really want to play Test cricket. That was my dream as a kid and it’s still my dream now. The desire was there and JL said look there are 400-odd players who have ever played Test cricket for Australia. It’s not something just to pass off lightly. After thinking about it for a good while I decided to give it another crack.”

Earlier, Ricky Ponting had spoken about Coulter Nile and said that he is extremely talented. Speaking to cricket.com.au, he said, “He’s a highly-talented player and he’s probably someone who’s been a little bit forgotten in Australian cricket because he’s been injured so much. We didn’t see him at all last season (2016-17) domestically, but the year before that we’d seen him in the Australian one-day and T20 teams and he was on the fringe of playing some Test cricket as well.”

“Anyone who can bowl above 140kph and swing the ball in India is going to make an impact. It’s not what the Indian top-order players are used to seeing and even for overseas top-order players, you’ve still got to be good enough to score runs and not get out against high-quality fast-bowling like Coulter-Nile’s.”, he said.

"Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan: Fashion hits and misses of the week (Aug 13 – Aug 19)","Hit and miss: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is a real beauty and probably that’s the reason why she can pull of almost anything with ease, even if the styling is not really commendable. Such is the case with her latest appearance at Manish Malhotra’s residence where she attended a party organised by the ace designer to celebrate his good friend, Sridevi’s birthday. The Ae Dil Hai Mushkil star stepped out in a lovely toga-inspired grey shimmer gown by Gaurav Gupta featuring an embellished neckline. If you ask us, the gown ticks all the right boxes for a simple yet elegant evening look and we would have been really happy with her choice for the soirée. But there’s a catch! Celebrity stylist Aastha Sharma who has worked with Aishwarya on a number of occasions, including Cannes 2017 red carpet, spoiled the look with a chainmail necklace. We wish she would have picked up something sleek in its place, it would have looked much better. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Hit and miss: At Saif Ali Khan's birthday party, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s nude lips became a talking point. Now, it might have looked good on her in person but going by the photos, it didn’t impress us much. In fact, it just added age to her face and the bronze make-up didn’t help either, it simply looked like she suffered sunburns. However, her choice of outfit is commendable. We love the gorgeous peek-a-boo Self-Portrait top which she paired with simple black leggings. (Source: Instagram/therealkarismakapoor)

Hit and miss: Deepika Padukone stepped out at the airport in a half gingham print and half pastel blue shirt and even though we applaud her for her sartorial experiment, it just failed to impress us. However, she totally aced her denim game in the fanciest and coolest pair ever! The 70s-inspired flared jeans are having a huge moment right now and Padukone took it to the next level with this one – we love how it’s frayed at the ankles. You can pair it with almost anything, starting from statement tees to tank tops and halter-necks – just make sure that your top isn’t baggy. You can complement your look like the Padmavati actor with a pair of Nike slides, minimum make-up, an updo and a pair of sunglasses. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

Miss: Having given us a series of stellar looks, Taapsee Pannu left us disappointed when she stepped out in a garish sari, jacket and belt by Aharin. There's absolutely nothing about this look that we like. Celebrity stylist Devki B could have done better, much better. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

Hit: We think Huma Qureshi looks really elegant in this simple black maxi. Even if it isn’t anything extraordinary, but paired with the patterned blue longlayered cape, it looks wonderful on her. Celebrity stylist Sanjana Batra who styled her, picked it up from Ritu Kumar and accessorised it well with Amrapali Jewels and Aquamarine Jewellery. Poker straight hair, smokey eyes, and a soft pink pout accentuated her beauty. (Source: Instagram/sanjanabatra)

Hit: With hair styled into thick retro waves by Shaan Muttathil, Jacqueline Fernandez chose to wear a gold lamé off-shoulder top from Monisha Jaising and a basic fitted denim jeans. She completed her look with a pair of black shoes from Saint Laurent and accessorised with earrings from Top Shop and bracelet from Deepa Gurnani. (Source: Instagram/lakshmilehr)

Hit: Pooja Hegde was seen mixing prints and patterns well in a Nupur Kanoi sari. Although it's not something we would have picked up, we think the Mohenjo Daro actor wore it well. The way the sari was draped by celebrity stylist Tanya Ghavri reminded us of how women in Bengal wear it in this particular style with the pallu falling beautifully at the front. She accessorised it with earrings from heritage fine jewellery by Sunita Shekhawat and added a nice, modern vibe to her look with a wavy ponytail. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

Hit: Priyanka Chopra was seen in a black sheer number with a plunging neckline and a dangerously thigh-high slit from Fendi. A diamond studded brooch pinned on the front added instant glamour to the look, but we think even without one she would have looked good – that is the beauty of the dress. She complemented the look with black peep toe heels, her signature brown lip shade, soft make-up and gorgeously tousled hair. (Source: Instagram/cristinaehrlich)

Hit: Deepika Padukone aced her airport style in basics. The white top (from Purple Paisley) and blue jeans (From Zara) combo is a classic and we love the way she casually shrugged on that denim jacket to add oomph to her too-cool-for-school look. The statement, ankle length boots and a pair of blue aviators made all the difference. It's something we would definitely like to try the next time we are jet-setting.

"Veteran artist Haroon Khimani, 81, to showcase his latest work in Mumbai","Haroon Khimani’s paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation. Haroon Khimani’s paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation.

Haroon Khimani might be an octogenarian but it has not lessened his love for art. The 81-year-old — who always seeks to discover the beauty of nature, mostly in collapsed structures and disasters, be it natural or man-made — will soon showcase his latest contemporary retrospective visual arts exhibition titled ‘Descent’ in Mumbai. His paintings will explore the fundamental existential dilemma of destruction and recreation, steeped into potential energy of rebuilding.

“There is an ethical side to nature which borders between ‘being’ and ‘nothingness’. That inspires me the most. For the artist, it is a chance to step inside their own creations, to appear in a visual story and establish an interaction. Creating a super sensual existence on the canvass is an intense personal experience. In my paintings you will see nature acts as a backdrop that determines human fate. Everything is in a flux. Ultimately the desperate elements form a whole and add to the tempo of narrative,” Khimani said in a statement.

The veteran artist, has earlier stated on his website, “Beauty has a new definition for me. My paintings look like landscapes but there is unusual magnitude of structural juxtaposition, depth, recession and space created by colours perceived through black and white tones. We all are habituated to see beauty in limited terms but in disorganised and chaotic nature new beauty forms are created by self-destruction of the existing structures. Nature does this wonderfully but it depends upon our outlook to see the beauty in it. In fact, at such junctures we are emotionally driven to sympathy towards sufferers and dislocated mass, which leads us to see the pathetic and helpless part of it rather than the aesthetic value.”

Bangladesh ramps up border patrols to deter fresh Rohingya inflow,"Rohingya refugees cross the border into Bangladesh close to Whaikyang in Cox’s Bazar District, Southeastern Bangladesh. (Amnesty International via AP) Rohingya refugees cross the border into Bangladesh close to Whaikyang in Cox’s Bazar District, Southeastern Bangladesh. (Amnesty International via AP)

Bangladesh has stepped up patrols on its border with Myanmar, following reports that about 1,000 Rohingya Muslims crossed into the country in the past two weeks, amid fresh tension in its neighbour’s northwestern Rakhine state. Security forces in Buddhist-majority Myanmar launched a massive crackdown in the state after Rohingya insurgents killed nine police in October, but the flow of refugees into Bangladesh had slowed until hundreds more soldiers were deployed recently. “Security forces are patrolling the villages daily,” said Rahim, a teacher from Dar Gyi Zar village in Myanmar who fled to Bangladesh last year, but remains in touch with family members.

“My mother is 73 and is panicking there, but she won’t be able to flee,” said Rahim, who uses one name, like many Rohingya.

“No one will be allowed to illegally cross into our country,” Manuzurul Hasan Khan, a senior Bangladesh border guard official, told Reuters, adding that the two countries were jointly patrolling frontier areas.

There had been no major influx recently, he said, adding that the border was peaceful, with more joint patrols scheduled for this week. However, Rahim and a Rohingya leader in Bangladesh put the total of new refugees at more than 1,000. There had been a constant “slow movement of people across the border,” a senior U.N. official in Bangladesh said. About 1,000 households had crossed each month in April, May and June, estimated the official, who declined to be identified in the absence of authorisation to talk to the media. The figure rose to 1,300 households in July, the official said, adding that the border area was “definitely seeing more new arrivals” in August.

About 500 of the newly arrived Rohingya live near an unofficial refugee camp in Leda, near the Naf river separating Bangladesh from Myanmar, said Zayed, a Rohingya leader. The rest have moved elsewhere in the border district of Cox’s Bazar. Before the latest inflow, about 75,000 Rohinhya had fled to Bangladesh since October, joining tens of thousands already there and straining resources.

Some families were packing up to leave, fearing another violent crackdown, a Rohingya resident of Maungdaw in Myanmar told Reuters. “People here are feeling depressed and getting so scared, hearing that more troops are coming to do area clearance again,” the resident said on Saturday, seeking anonymity for fear of repercussions.

“We have no one to protect us here.”

The resident and a human rights monitor with sources in northern Rakhine said security forces had run intensive searches and arrested some Rohingya men. Kyaw Swar Tun, an administrator in the Rakhine state capital of Sittwe, said security had been stepped up in the state’s north, but denied that Muslims were fleeing across the border.

“I don’t hear anything of Bengali people leaving or entering the country during these days,” he said, using a derogatory term for the Rohingya to imply they are interlopers from Bangladesh.

The treatment of the roughly one million Rohingya in Myanmar has emerged as the country’s most contentious human rights issue as it transitions from decades of harsh military rule. Myanmar denies citizenship to the Rohingya and classifies them as illegal immigrants, though they claim roots there dating back centuries.

Myanmar security forces continue to harrass Rohingya in Rakhine, said Noor Bashar, 26, who fled to Cox’s Bazar last week.

“Many more are still waiting to enter Bangladesh but it’s difficult, due to the increased patrolling,” she told Reuters.

Shankersinh Vaghela rules out floating party or forming third front,"Former Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela. (File/Photo) Former Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela. (File/Photo)

Former Congress heavyweight Shankersinh Vaghela is keeping political parties in poll-bound Gujarat guessing about his future political course, days after he resigned as the Congress MLA in presence of senior BJP leaders. Maintaining suspense over his future political move, the veteran politician on Sunday ruled out floating any outfit or forming third front. Vaghela had already clarified that he was not going back to the BJP which he had quit in 1990s.

Interestingly, none of the 13 former Congress MLAs, believed to be the loyalists of Vaghela, was present at the meeting of his supporters held at his residence in Gandhinagar today.

At the meeting, Vaghela’s supporters passed a resolution urging him to “become active in order to ease the pains of people of Gujarat who are facing many problems at present”.

The resolution, which was shared with the media, was passed by around 250 supporters of the Kshatriya strongman at the meeting.

As per the resolution, the issues like price-rise, high electricity charges, unemployment, and costly education have affected the common man in Gujarat the most.

Vaghela’s supporters claimed that various sections of the society, including businessmen, farmers, students and women, are having a feeling that they were left to fend for themselves and there is no one to hold their hand.

Through the resolution, supporters urged Vaghela (77) to “become active” in order to put an end to such problems.

After the meeting, Vaghela insisted that the gathering was not political. He said the meeting was not aimed at exploring the possibility of floating a party or a third front ahead of the Assembly polls, expected to be held later this year.

“This was a gathering to discuss various issues concerning people and how we can help them. There was no talk about floating a party or forming a third front. As people’s sufferings are mounting, my supporters wanted me to go between them and ease their pain,” Vaghela told reporters.

When asked how he is planning to take up these issues, Vaghela said, “I will keep you informed about what and how I will do that”.

While addressing his supporters, Vaghela asked them to take care of each of the 182 constituencies in Gujarat.

“I just gave an example that you (supporters) are more than 182. Thus, I urge you to take care of each of the 182 seats, so that people start putting trust in you. Instead of working for any party, my message was that we all must remain by the side of truth,” he said.

Vaghela had voted against Congress stalwart Ahmed Patel in the recently-held Rajya Sabha elections in the state. However, Patel went on to win the keenly-fought battle after the Election Commission invalidated the votes of two rebel Congress MLAs for the violation of poll procedure.

Vaghela fell out with the Congress after the party reportedly refused to pay heed to his demands that he be declared the chief ministerial nominee and given a free hand in selecting the party candidates.

The Congress has been out of power in Gujarat for over the last two decades.

"Utkal Express derailment: ‘Heard a loud noise, saw coaches flying’","The Kalinga Utkal Express went off the rails on a single track that connects Meerut to Haridwar. (Express Photo by Praveen Khanna) The Kalinga Utkal Express went off the rails on a single track that connects Meerut to Haridwar. (Express Photo by Praveen Khanna)

Some time before 6 pm on Saturday, Mohammad Salim of Khatauli’s Nayi Abadi village heard a sound like a bomb blast. For a few bewildered moments, he saw train coaches flying in the air, he said — and then collapsing on top of one another.

There were people inside the coaches, and he could hear their cries for help. It was something Salim had never seen, or could have imagined.

He ran towards the tracks, Salim said. “Hundreds of people rushed from our village. We got two cots and two ladders, and started pulling out people one by one. We rushed them to Mansoor, the local doctor in our village, who administered first aid to the injured before the ambulances started arriving,” he said.

Well over six hours after the derailment — past midnight — Salim continued to stand at the spot. As rescue crews cut through the mangled coaches, he said he feared many people were still trapped inside. “People were screaming bacha lo, bacha lo… Four women are still trapped… I saw them in the evening, but I could not save them,” he said.

The Kalinga Utkal Express went off the rails on a single track that connects Meerut to Haridwar. The line runs between two villages, Jagat Colony and Nayi Abadi. Some 25 trains go past the villages every day on average, local people said.

Several people from Jagat Colony said they had watched in shock as a coach went flying off the track and into the building of an intermediate college. “Women, children, men, everyone was screaming. We tried to help in whatever way we could,” they said.

Residents of both villages said some sort of repair work had been under way on the track for the last 10 days. Two local people, who identified themselves as Himanshu and Ali, said they thought the train was going unusually fast.

“Generally we see trains slow down as they pass through here. But this one did not,” they said.

Mahesh Chandra Sharma of Morena, Madhya Pradesh, who was travelling to Haridwar in the coach immediately following the engine, too, thought the train was travelling very fast. “We are lucky to be alive,” he said. Village residents said three or four people who were not on the train had been crushed during the derailment. No official was, however, available to confirm this.

SSP Muzaffarnagar Anant Dev said he could confirm 16 people had died and 74 were injured. DM G S Priyadarshi said he had asked for a special “hydra crane” to lift the coaches. Around 150 personnel of the NDRF were on the spot. Around midnight, four personnel carried out a woman’s body on stretcher. NDRF Assistant Commandant P K Shrivastav said their prime concern was to seek out people who might still be alive inside the wreckage.

A Thana Coloured Saffron,"For many, the declaration of Adityanath as CM was the culmination of a campaign designed to exclude minorities: The BJP did not field a single Muslim candidate in UP and the PM himself drew binaries between shamshans and kabristans. (Express photo by Vishal Srivastav ) For many, the declaration of Adityanath as CM was the culmination of a campaign designed to exclude minorities: The BJP did not field a single Muslim candidate in UP and the PM himself drew binaries between shamshans and kabristans. (Express photo by Vishal Srivastav )

The least problematic aspect of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s statement implying that Muslim residents offering namaz in public are comparable to police stations in the state becoming associated with the majority religion is that it is a simple logical fallacy. The “false equivalence” between ordinary citizens exercising their freedom of religion and the co-opting of police stations for janmashthami celebrations is, however, symptomatic of a deeper malaise. At its core, it goes towards confirming the fears — often unstated — that the ideological underpinnings of Adityanath and the BJP will erode the values of India’s constitutional morality.

For most Indians, the thana is the site of their most basic — and often most important — interactions with the state. It is the primary port of call for those seeking justice, whether victims of petty crime or community-based violence. While a section of the population, among the middle classes and elites, has been able to minimise its interaction with the state, having seceded into private networks of privilege, security and gated enclaves, the police station and the tehsil office remain essential to the lives of the poor majority. And in a state like UP, where the government has functioned through political patronage, they become all the more important. It is in the impartiality and efficiency of this primary unit that governments, and even the state itself, are judged on that most ephemeral and essential of electoral issues — law and order.

Given their importance, the UP CM’s attempt to draw a parallel between ordinary public spaces and police stations can have one of two explanations. First, that he feels his government is genuinely incapable of enforcing the propriety that officers and offices of the law should hold: “Agar mai sadak par Eid ke din namaz padhne pe rok nahi laga sakta to mujhe koi adhikar nahi ki mai thanon mein janmashtami ke parv ko rokun,” Adityanath said at an event in Lucknow. It is highly improbable that any chief minister, let alone a “strong” one like Yogi, will make statements conveying helplessness.

The second, and more obvious, explanation is this: The CM’s statement is a thinly veiled message to minorities. The police station is no longer, even symbolically, a secular entity. The display of religious identity and belief in an ordinary public space by Muslims will be met by a majoritarian government, uniform and all. That the Constitution of India accords minorities religious and educational rights precisely because they may be under threat, real or perceived, from the majority seems to have no bearing on the UP CM’s philosophy of governance. By overtly backing the communalisation of the thana, Adityanath has hinted that he sees the last UP assembly election result as more than just a change in government.

For many, the declaration of Adityanath as CM was the culmination of a campaign designed to exclude minorities: The BJP did not field a single Muslim candidate in UP and the PM himself drew binaries between shamshans and kabristans. Despite, or even because of the campaign, the party won a magnificent majority and elevated arguably its most prominently controversial Hindutva leader (of “love jihad” fame) to the helm of India’s most populous state. In ways both subtle and blunt, it was clear that the Hindus of UP were being asked to vote on lines that were saffron-hued.

That they did so overwhelmingly certainly has a bearing on the statements we hear from the CM. The unit of governance no longer appears to be the citizen and its purpose no longer to protect her/his fundamental rights. The individual is increasingly just an extension of their religion, and the character and attitude of the institutions of the state towards them may well be determined by that ascriptive identity.

A democratic polity, however, is not just about electoral victories and defeats. It is governed by a set of larger principles, more enduring than a five-year cycle. For India, those principles are enshrined in its Constitution. As the temporary occupant of a constitutional office, the UP CM owes at least symbolic fidelity to its values. In doing so, he may find more than just the ability to make logically consistent arguments. He could, in fact, ensure that “sabka saath sabka vikas” becomes more than just a tragic punchline.

Barcelona terror attack: Spain police say suspects planned bigger assault,"A woman cries in front of a memorial tribute to the victims of the terrorist attack in Barcelona. Police on Friday shot and killed five people carrying bomb belts who were connected to the Barcelona van attack.

Suspects in Spain’s twin terror attacks had been planning an even bigger assault than the deadly car rampages they carried out, police said, as distressing details emerged of families torn apart in the horror. A 35-year-old Italian was among 14 killed, mowed down in front of his wife and young children in Barcelona when a driver rammed his van through crowds on the busy Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday, before fleeing on foot.

Police said they shot dead five “suspected terrorists” who had knocked pedestrians down in the Catalan seaside resort of Cambrils in a second attack in the early hours of Friday, and arrested four others as Spain reeled from the deadly violence. Catalonia’s regional police identified three of the suspects who were killed as Moroccan nationals. They were Moussa Oukabir, 17, Said Aallaa, 18, and Mohamed Hychami, 24.

Police said yesterday they suspect 12 people of involvement in the attacks: the five who were killed, four who were arrested and three who have been identified but who remain at large. Officials suspect that two of these three may have died in a blast at a house in the town of Alcanar, about 200 kilometres (140 miles) south of Barcelona on Wednesday evening.

Initially treated as a random gas blast, police later linked the explosion to the Barcelona assault, believing occupants of the house were preparing a larger attack, possibly a vehicle bomb, with the use of gas canisters and slipped up. Police removed dozens of gas canisters from the house, according to an AFP photographer at the scene.

“They were preparing one or several attacks in Barcelona, and an explosion in Alcanar stopped this as they no longer had the material they needed to commit attacks of an even bigger scope,” said Josep Lluis Trapero of Catalonia’s police. After the explosion the suspects quickly went on to commit “more rudimentary” attacks. These involved the vehicles ploughing into pedestrians in Barcelona and Cambrils, he added.

The Cambrils suspects had an axe and knives in the car as well as fake explosive belts stuck to their bodies, said police. Both Spanish attacks followed the same modus operandi. Drivers deliberately targeted pedestrians with their vehicles, the latest in a series of such assaults in Europe. The Mediterranean resort of Nice in France was particularly hard hit on July 14, 2016, when a man rammed a truck into a crowd, killing 86 people.

Otso Iho of Jane’s Terrorism and Insurgency Centre said the Spanish assaults, which stretched out over two different cities, appeared to be “a much higher level of coordination than has been typically present in previous attacks.” It is also believed to be the first time IS has claimed an attack in Spain.

In a poignant moment Friday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, King Felipe VI and the president of Catalonia — where both attacks took place — held a minute of silence in Barcelona. It was followed by the crowd applauding and shouting “not afraid”.

But in a sign of the tensions sparked by the attacks, about 20 far-right militants tried to protest at the march. Some held up signs reading “No More Mosques” or “Refugees not welcome anymore”. Scuffles broke out between the far-right militants and the march participants. Details started to emerge yesterday on the identity of victims, as did tragic stories of families ripped apart.

All for a good cause: This cafe in Australia charges male customers 18 per cent ‘man tax’,"The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien.(Source: @paigecardona/Twitter) The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien.(Source: @paigecardona/Twitter)

If you are in Melbourne, Australia and happen to look for a vegan cafe, then you can head to Handsome Her. But if you’re a man, be prepared to end up paying more than the female customers. Yes, the cafe levies a surcharge on male customers, but there’s a powerful message behind it.

No one likes paying more taxes based on their gender, right? Then how are people okay with the pay gap based on gender? It’s a known fact that around the world there is a big difference in the remuneration received by men and women. From entertainment industry to big enterprises, many are guilty of practising the vice.

The ‘man tax’ paid at this cafe is to highlight the disparities in pay scale. The male customers are expected to pay a surcharge fixed at 18 per cent but it’s not compulsory or asked every day. The additional cost is levied only once a week, per month.

The idea of the ‘man tax’ was started by the cafe’s owner Alex O’Brien. She says her restaurant is ‘for women, by women’ but men are always welcome. The main motive behind this move is to start a conversation over the issue of gender equality in the workplace. Talking to the Daily Mirror, O’Brien said, “If men don’t want to pay it, we’re not going to kick them out the door. It’s just an opportunity to do some good.”

She describes herself as a “feminist, not the fun kind”, and added: “We’re bringing it [the gender pay gap] to the forefront of people’s minds. I like that it is making men stop and question their privilege a little bit.”

According to the report by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, which used Australian Bureau of Statistics data from 2016, it stated that the full-time gender pay gap is around 18 per cent. And no, the extra earning is not stashed away, it is donated to charities.

“Alex plans to rotate them four times a year. In August, the earnings will go to an organisation called Elizabeth Morgan House, which helps Aboriginal women and children,” the report added.

Many have praised her for her meaningful initiative.

"Amid Trump backlash, his UN envoy says stand up, isolate hate","U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley (File Photo) U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley (File Photo)

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told staff in an email – seen by Reuters on Friday – that everyone must stand up and condemn hate, as President Donald Trump faces a backlash for his response to violence at a protest by white nationalists. Trump blamed both sides for clashes in the southern college town of Charlottesville in Virginia last weekend, where white nationalists were protesting the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. A woman was killed when a suspected white nationalist plowed his car into a crowd.

“Those who march spewing hate are few, but loud. We must denounce them at every turn, and make them feel like they are on an island and isolate them the same way they wish to isolate others,” wrote Haley, a member of Trump’s cabinet, in the email sent Thursday to staff at the U.S. mission to the United Nations.

Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, said the “horrible acts” seen in Charlottesville “took me back to sad days dealing with the Charleston tragedy in 2015.”

Haley attracted national attention when she secured the removal of the Confederate battle flag from South Carolina’s capitol grounds after a white supremacist killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston.

“People aren’t born with hate. We all have a responsibility to stand up and condemn it,” Haley wrote in the email to staff, which did not refer to Trump.

“While we should respect diversity of viewpoints, it is incumbent on us to challenge hate with the values we cherish. And it is incumbent on us to never, ever countenance violence as we do so,” she said.

Trump has alienated Republicans, corporate leaders and U.S. allies, rattled markets and prompted speculation about possible White House resignations with his comments since the violence in Charlottesville.

On Monday, Trump bowed to political pressure and denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan by name, but on Tuesday he again inflamed tensions by insisting counter-protesters were also to blame and that there were “very fine people” among both groups.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and several top U.S. military officers have since broadly condemned racism.

United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in a Twitter post on Tuesday said that racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia were “poisoning our societies,” adding: “We must stand up against them. Every time. Everywhere.”

Battleground Asia for China’s heavy hitters,"Guangzhou Evergrande have won the CSL title in each of the last six seasons and been crowned Asian champions twice since 2013. (Source: File) Guangzhou Evergrande have won the CSL title in each of the last six seasons and been crowned Asian champions twice since 2013. (Source: File)

Chinese Super League champions Guangzhou Evergrande and big spending Shanghai SIPG take their domestic rivalry onto the continental stage when managers Luiz Felipe Scolari and Andre Villas-Boas face off in the first leg of the Asian Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday.

Both clubs have become dominant forces in Chinese football, with cash-rich SIPG spending heavily to supercharge their attempt to deny Guangzhou a record-extending seventh domestic title.

Guangzhou have won the CSL title in each of the last six seasons and been crowned Asian champions twice since 2013 and, despite their rivals spending heavily on Brazilian trio Oscar, Hulk and Elkeson, Scolari’s men hold the upper hand going into the first leg.

“We have done very well in our last two games,” Scolari said after a 3-0 win over Shanghai Shenhua on Saturday saw his side extend their lead over SIPG in the league to eight points.

“The players repaid my trust with an excellent performance. We are a team and working together for the championship. I can’t be sure about our line-up for next week’s Asian Champions League game, it will depend on the players’ situation at that moment.

“But after Paulinho’s departure and Huang Bowen’s injury our midfield faces challenges.” Evergrande have been weakened by the sale of Brazilian Paulinho to Barcelona after the former Tottenham Hotspur man played a key role in an underperforming Guangzhou navigating their way through the earlier stages of the competition.

The 29-year-old scored five times in eight games, including in the away goals win over Japanese champions Kashima Antlers in the round of 16.

“Paulinho’s a great player and was an important member of our team,” Guangzhou captain Zheng Zhi said. But every team has players come and go. Of course his departure will have some impact on us, but we believe his spot can be filled by lots of players in our team.

“We have won so many titles over the years and it was not because of one player, it was down to the achievements of the team. We all contributed to the team and I have no doubt our midfield players will help the team a lot.”

While Evergrande lead in the league, SIPG hold the upper hand in the Chinese FA Cup, with Villas-Boas’ team claiming a 2-1 win when the two teams met in the first leg of the semi-finals played last week.

But with their challenge for the league title ebbing away, the pressure is mounting on Villas-Boas to take SIPG into the semi-finals of the Asian Champions League for the first time in the club’s history.

“Next week’s match we will use different tactics,” Villas-Boas said after his side’s loss against Guizhou Zhicheng on Saturday. “Today we sent out our best team, but failed to achieve the ideal result.”

The winner of the Chinese duel will meet either Urawa Red Diamonds or Kawasaki Frontale, both from Japan, in the semi-finals.

In the west of the continent, Iran’s Persepolis meet Al Ahli from Saudi Arabia and last year’s beaten finalists, Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates, face off against Saudi Arabia’s Al Hilal.

Liking different brands can make partners unhappy: Study,"If you’re the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner’s preferences, you are going to be less happy. (Source: Thinkstock Images) If you’re the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner’s preferences, you are going to be less happy. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

It may not seem like a big deal whether your partner prefers Coke or Pepsi, but scientists suggest that liking different brands can affect our happiness in relationships more than shared interests or personality traits.

“People think compatibility in relationships comes from having similar backgrounds, religion or education,” said Gavan Fitzsimons, a professor at Duke University in the US.

“But we find those things don’t explain how happy you are in life nearly as much as this notion of brand compatibility,” said Fitzsimons.

The researchers found that partners who had low power in their relationships – those who do not feel they can shape their partner’s behaviour – tend to find themselves stuck with their partner’s preferred brands.

“If you are lower in relationship power and have different brand preferences than your partner, you’re probably going to find yourself stuck with your partner’s favourite brands, over and over again. This could lead to a death-by-a-thousand-cuts feeling,” said Danielle Brick, now at the University of New Hampshire.

“Most couples won’t break up over brand incompatibility, but it leads to the low power partner becoming less and less happy,” said Brick.

Studies in several settings produced the same result. The researchers used brand preferences in soda, coffee, chocolate, beer and automobiles to study individuals and couples, some of whom were tracked over two years.

These results were combined with findings on relationship power and happiness.

Brick said it is likely these brand compatibility effects have steadily gained strength as brands have evolved to play a bigger role in the daily lives of consumers.

However, they are not given the same weight as other relationship-influencing factors because they are not seen as significant.

“If you are a different religion than your romantic partner, you know that if this is an issue you can’t work through, then the relationship isn’t going to last,” Brick said.

“Conversely, if you like Coke and your partner likes Pepsi, you’re probably not going to break up over it – but 11 years into a relationship, when he or she keeps coming home with Pepsi, day in and day out, it might start to cause a little conflict,” she said.

“If you’re the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner’s preferences, you are going to be less happy,” she added.

The research was published in the Journal of Consumer Research.

"Govt, RBI in dialogue for PSB recapitalisation: Urjit Patel","Patel also blamed lenders for the mess, saying their poor credit appraisal systems have led to the pile of bad loans, which tops over Rs 9 lakh crore now.(Source: Express Photo/Pradip Das) Patel also blamed lenders for the mess, saying their poor credit appraisal systems have led to the pile of bad loans, which tops over Rs 9 lakh crore now.(Source: Express Photo/Pradip Das)

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Urjit Patel on Saturday said that the government and the central bank are in dialogue to prepare “a packet of measures” for recapitalisation of public sector banks (PSBs), to help them resolve the issue of non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans in a “time-bound manner”.

Patel, who was speaking here at a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) conference on Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), said the success and credibility of all the resolution efforts would be critically contingent on the strength of PSBs balance sheets to absorb the costs.

“It is clear that PSBs will need to take haircuts on current exposures under any resolution plan agreed within or outside the IBC. Higher provisioning requirements on this count as well as other factors will affect the capital position of several banks. This would necessitate a higher re-capitalisation of these banks. The government and the RBI are in dialogue to prepare a packet of measure to enable the PSBs to shore-up the requisite capital in a time-bound manner,” said Patel.

Patel said the measures could include a combination of capital raising from the market, dilution of government holding, additional capital infusion by the government, merger based on strategic decision and sale of non-core assets.

“Gross NPA ratio of the banking system at 9.6 per cent and stressed advances ratio at 12 per cent as of March 2017 on the back of persistently high ratio in the past few years, is indeed a matter of concern,” said Patel.

The RBI chief said as much as 86.5 per cent of GNPAs are accounted by large borrowers.

“Swift time-bound resolution or liquidation of stressed assets will be critical for delogging the balance sheet and for efficient reallocation of bank capital,” said Patel.

The government and the RBI are working together to comprehensively address the issue through a multi-pronged approach, he added.

Patel also blamed lenders for the mess, saying their poor credit appraisal systems have led to the pile of bad loans, which tops over Rs 9 lakh crore now.

"Diet diary: From Andes to Japanese islands, lessons in longevity","Scientific studies and research have shown that besides genetic factors, longevity is strongly linked to food and exercise habits. Scientific studies and research have shown that besides genetic factors, longevity is strongly linked to food and exercise habits.

Immortality is impossible but living a long life isn’t. Some cultures like the Vilcabambans of the Ecuadorian Andes, the Hunza of Pakistan and the centenarians of the Okinawa island in Japan are known for their long lives and may help scientists dealing with life expectancy.

Okinawa, for instance, is home to the world’s healthiest elderly with the longest recorded life expectancies. Scientific studies and research have shown that besides genetic factors, longevity is strongly linked to food and exercise habits.

Low-calorie healthy diets and high physical activity in these extraordinarily healthy societies are the secrets for their extended lifespans with virtually no reported incidence of diseases like high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, diabetes and other degenerative diseases such as rheumatism, osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s and vision problems.

So what are the dietary secrets to longevity? Eating less has been found to be critical and seems to be the centrepiece of longevity. In animal experiments, researchers have demonstrated that calorie restriction has now been clearly proven to be effective and up to 30 per cent calorie restriction leads to extended years in a manner believed to be similar to genetic modification. Additionally, high intake of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, soy, fish and eating less fat along with healthy lifestyle seems to explain protection from diseases and increased lifespan.

A study reported that healthy older Okinawans eat an average of seven servings of vegetables, seven servings of whole grains, two servings of soy products; fish twice or thrice a week and very little sugar and added fats. Their diets include little meat and no margarines, hydrogenated fats or trans fat.

Although the impact of good nutrition on health and disease begins very early in life, it’s never too late to make changes. According to researchers, at age 65 men and women in high- income countries still have a life expectancy of a further 15 and 19 years respectively. The older one becomes, the longer one is likely to live, and thus, by the time men and women reach age 75, life expectancy is still 9 and 11 years, respectively. This dispels the common assumption that changes in lifestyle to improve health are no longer worthwhile in old age. In fact, the prevalence of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and arthritis is highest in the older population. Studies demonstrate that it is still worthwhile for older people to make lifestyle changes like diet modification, weight reduction, sodium restriction, saturated fat restriction smoking cessation — and that these changes make life in later years healthier, more active and less dependent.

Clearly, living long is not a coincidence. It is a result of many factors and when it comes to health and longevity, the sum of the dietary components is greater than its individual elements. The important thing to be remembered is that these scientifically proven secrets of the world’s healthiest and long-lived people are simple to say the least. Adopting them with common sense can certainly extend your later years with vibrancy and vitality.

Super-centenarian diet

"Photos: Shah Rukh Khan and son Aryan Khan are twinning, and we are stunned at their resemblance","Shah Rukh Khan and his son Aryan Khan must have bowled over their female fans. Shah Rukh Khan and his son Aryan Khan must have bowled over their female fans.

Like father, like son is all that comes to our mind when we see Superstar Shah Rukh Khan and his son Aryan Khan. The handsome star and his good looking son was seen together at the Mumbai airport, last night. We do not know where this father-son duo was heading to but they looked simply stunning in their black leather jackets. SRK and Aryan were twinning in white T-shirt and the jacket, and they looked alike too.

Young Aryan Khan looks like a carbon copy of father Shah Rukh Khan and has his own fan following already. We recently saw a fan make a split of the images of SRK and Aryan and saw how the two look so much alike. At the airport, Aryan looked happy and not only posed for photos, but also shook hand with fans. We guess the two were leaving for the US where Aryan is now pursuing his film studies at the University of Southern California.

SRK and Aryan’s pictures must have bowled over their female fans! Shah Rukh Khan is a doting father and he does not believe in poking his nose in his kids’ life and is just a phone call away from them even after being super busy with his films. In an earlier interview, SRK revealed his side as a father and also spoke about his son, Aryan’s ambitions.

See the latest image of Shah Rukh Khan and son Aryan Khan here:

Also, see a fan-made collage of SRK and Aryan Khan:

When the actor spoke about his son Aryan, who is soon to turn 20, he did not seem worried about him. In fact, the 51-year-old says that Aryan is much sorted and has future plans, which is to be better than him.

“He talks about his ambitions, and where he would like to be one day. But he’s very clear that way. He just wants to be bigger than me and that’s cool,” SRK had said then.

"‘Sexual Assault’ Days after immolation bid, teen dies","Image for representation only Image for representation only

A 17-year-old girl, who had on Thursday tried to immolate herself at her residence in Adarsh Mandi area of Shamli, died at a hospital in Meerut on Saturday. The girl, allegedly sexually assaulted at a hotel in June by two youths who also made a video of the act, had sustained 80 per cent burns. Her mother, in a complaint to police on Thursday, had alleged that her daughter took the step after the accused shared the video with other youths around two weeks ago. Following this, the two youths were booked on charges including attempt to rape and abetment of suicide.

In her dying declaration on Saturday, while the girl accused the youths of harassing her by threatening to make the video and photographs public, she did not allege that they tried to rape her, said Shamli SP Ajay Pal. One of the two youths, also a 17-year-old, was detained on Saturday and produced before the juvenile justice board, which sent him to a correction home, said Adarsh Mandi SHO Raj Kumar Sharma. “…several witnesses have told the police that the boys used to harass her,” Sharma said.

"More potent, safer Zika vaccine developed","Scientists have developed the world’s first plant-based Zika vaccine. (Representational Image) Scientists have developed the world’s first plant-based Zika vaccine. (Representational Image)

Scientists have developed the world’s first plant-based Zika vaccine that may be more effective, safer and cheaper than other vaccines against the mosquito-borne virus. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available to combat Zika, researchers said. The vaccine developed by researchers from Arizona State University (ASU) in the US works against a part of a Zika viral protein, called DIII, that plays a key role for the virus to infect people.

“All flaviviruses have the envelope protein on the outside part of the virus. It has three domains,” said Qiang Chen, a scientist at ASU.

“The domain III has a unique stretch of DNA for the Zika virus, and we exploited this to generate a robust and protective immune response that is unique for Zika,” said Chen, who led the research published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The researchers first grew the envelope protein in bacteria, then prepared the DIII protein domain in tobacco plants.

The team then performed immunisation experiments in mice, which induced antibody and cellular immune responses that have been shown to confer 100 per cent protection against multiple Zika virus strains in mice. The team’s protein-based vaccine uses the smallest and most unique part of the Zika virus that can still elicit a potent and robust immune response.

“In our approach, we make what we call a pseudovirus. It is a fake virus. The pseudovirus displays only the DIII part of the envelope protein on the surface,” said Chen.

“We did a test to make sure that the vaccine produces a potent protective immune response, but also, that it does not produce antibodies that may be cross reactive for dengue, West Nile, yellow fever or others,” he said.

The worldwide Zika threat first emerged in 2015, infecting millions as it swept across the Americas. It struck great fear in pregnant women, as babies born with severe brain birth defects quickly overburdened hospitals and public health care systems.

Homeless California war veteran gets place to call home,"In this Monday, Aug. 14, 2017 photo, Iraq war veteran Vernon Poling, 44, takes pictures of plants in the courtyard of his apartment complex in Midway City, Calif. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) In this Monday, Aug. 14, 2017 photo, Iraq war veteran Vernon Poling, 44, takes pictures of plants in the courtyard of his apartment complex in Midway City, Calif. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)

Vernon Poling was 44 years old when he got a home of his own. The Iraq war veteran was medically discharged from the Army in 2014, had to quit his trucking job for medical reasons, and found himself living out of his pickup last year in Orange County, a sprawling area of Southern California best known for its beaches, Disneyland and high housing costs.

Poling was homeless for seven months before he found temporary housing in the area. He then learned about Potter’s Lane, an apartment complex just for homeless veterans, with units made from recycled shipping containers. It’s believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.

On a sunny Friday in April, Poling walked into his 480-square-foot (45-square-meter) apartment for the first time, set down his backpack on his new floor and took it all in.

“I have never had a place of my own,” Poling said. “I got out of high school, I tried working. I was still living with the parents. I joined the Army at 23, active duty. Then I was staying with Uncle Sam in the barracks … To finally have my own place, it feels really good.”

Poling was the last of 15 homeless veterans to move into Potter’s Lane, a $6.7 million project paid for with federal, state and local dollars, donations and money from the nonprofit behind the project, American Family Housing, among other sources.

The apartments could easily belong to San Francisco tech workers or hipsters in Los Angeles’ trendy Arts District. Each of the 15 furnished units are made of three shipping containers pieced together and spiffed up with faux wood flooring, drywall and floor-to-ceiling windows on two of four walls. They include artwork and homemade quilts, and overlook a courtyard that includes a giant American flag, a garden, grills and picnic tables.

American Family Housing wanted to make sure the complex’s design built on the strength of America’s military, said Donna Gallup the group’s president.

“All of the units look over the courtyard so that they can watch each other’s backs and develop that community and that sense of belonging,” she said.

The men now living at Potter’s Lane were among 350 homeless veterans in Orange County. The county’s homeless population is much smaller than that of neighboring Los Angeles, but it’s expanding. Orange County has about 4,800 homeless people overall — a 13 percent increase since 2013, according to Point-in-Time, a group that tracks homelessness.

Potter’s Lane is a positive step forward, but with just 15 apartments, it’s also a “drop in the bucket” for the region’s homeless, said Eve Garrow, homelessness policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union’s Orange County office.

“About 54 percent of all people experiencing homelessness in the county are literally living in the streets,” Garrow said. “Meanwhile, the wait time for affordable housing is between five and 10 years when you can get on the list. So there’s a dire shortage.”

Garrow also has concerns about the location of Potter’s Lane in a commercial area among car repair shops.

“We need to be thinking about models that integrate people who were previously homeless so they can enjoy and access all the benefits the community offers,” Garrow said. “It may be politically a little easier to put these projects in more remote or industrial areas, but that may not be meeting the needs of the people who occupy those units.”

Gallup of American Family Housing said the location helped speed the permitting process, which was key.

“In just about six months’ time we had an entire 15-unit project completed,” Gallup said. “Normally a traditional project would take up to two years to build, and the fact that our homeless veterans are sleeping on the streets right now, I think timing is very important.”

Megan Hustings, director of the Washington, D.C.-based National Coalition for the Homeless, said she’s never heard of using shipping containers for permanent housing for the homeless, though there have been affordable housing projects involving tiny houses in places like Denver, Seattle and Austin.

A lack of affordable housing nationwide means more projects like Potter’s Lane are needed, Hustings said.

“We’re going to have to consider a wide variety of solutions,” she said. “Everyone’s really feeling the crunch. It’s just everywhere.”

After two months of living in his new home, Poling said he was feeling settled and had made friends, particularly with his next-door neighbor Dale Dollar, a former Marine who was homeless for 14 years.

On a recent Monday evening, Poling and Dollar sidled up to a picnic table with plates of pasta and salad, part of a weekly meal provided to Potter’s Lane residents by a local nonprofit. They laughed and bobbed their heads to upbeat oldies playing on speakers as they chowed down.

Though he appreciates the company, Poling said the best part of his new home is probably his bed.

“There’s been a couple nights that I’ve been surprised I’ve slept so long,” Poling said. “It’s a load off.”

Students work to give ‘neglected’ places in city a new meaning,"Students of Chandigarh College of Architecture on Saturday. (Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh) Students of Chandigarh College of Architecture on Saturday. (Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh)

In a quest of enhance the derelict spaces of the city, a group of students from Chandigarh College of Architecture are collaboratively working on improving the neglected areas. The students are working on a competition project as directed by the NASA (National Association of Students of Architecture) to bring life in the abandoned and ‘lost spaces’ in Chandigarh and have identified around 1-2 ‘lost spaces’ in almost every sector of the city.

In one such effort, the students have transformed an area in front of the EWS housing colony in Sector 26E into a vibrant community space driven by social impact. “With an aim to bring the residents and the people of the city closer, we are trying to reform the space while catering to the prevalent social problems of child education for the underprivileged children and lack of safe playing zones for kids, said Kanav, a student of Bsc Architecture of Chandigarh College of Architecture. Sharing more information about the work, he said, “While working on my project, I had found a location in Sector 34 near Gurudwara, quite inappropriate. We worked on the place and changes were made. Now, we are waiting for the response of the people, to move further with our project”.

Working on their design interventions, the students have installed custom-made sustainable sitting units to attend to the lack of sitting benches in the area. They have also worked to turn the empty land into an organic playground by installing cubical frames from scrap iron. The frames would offer community gathering spaces and also an element to innovate and play.

The students also intend to start an educational programme by introducing day classes for the underprivileged kids with the help of the residents of the society without charging any fee.

Charlottesville incident: ‘Donald Trump failed at the simplest of political tests’,"Composite image courtesy The Economist/The New Yorker Composite image courtesy The Economist/The New Yorker

Magazine cover arts of the New Yorker and the Economist slammed US President Donald Trump by portraying him as blowing at a KKK mask shaped sail and yelling through a KKK megaphone respectively. This is in light of his weak and equivocal denouncements of the Charlotteville white supremacist rallies which killed one activist protesting racism, Heather Heyer, and injured more when a van suddenly rammed into a crowd of them on Sunday, August 13. The self-identifying ethno-nationalists had marched to Charlottesville to protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, the Confederacy’s great general during the American civil war.

Trump took two days to condemn the KKK and the neo-Nazi groups, which angered Americans aplenty. Under immense pressure from the media, he finally allowed that the hate groups were “repugnant”. However, during an anti-media diatribe in the Tuesday press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, he made a U-turn, claiming that there was “blame on both sides” and appeared to assert moral equivalence between neo-Nazis carrying signs with Swastikas, mouthing racial slurs and the activists protesting against racism. Little wonder then that a lot of Americans feel that Trump’s reel back betrays his enduring soft spot for the white nationalists, in spite of the overt and aggressive racial hate and bigotry they intend to inject into the American community and compromise its unity.

An early look at next week’s cover, “Blowhard,” by David Plunkert: http://t.co/VuBXtwJCUQ pic.twitter.com/zsDHVOBBQO — The New Yorker (@NewYorker) August 17, 2017

“President Trump’s weak pushback to hate groups – as if he was trying not to alienate them as voters – compelled me to take up my pen,” said David Plunkert, the artist behind the new New Yorker cover who usually does not address political subjects in his work. “A picture does a better job showing my thoughts than words do; it can have a light touch on a subject that’s extremely scary,” he added in a statement to the New Yorker.

Donald Trump is politically inept, morally barren and temperamentally unfit for office http://t.co/xLDMtLclUw — The Economist (@TheEconomist) August 17, 2017

The Economist’s recent editorial responded to Trump’s lingering defense of the Confederate statues on Twitter, while he retreated his unequivocal condemnation of the white supremacists’ actions.

Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017

“Mr Trump’s seemingly heartfelt defense of those marching to defend Confederate statues spoke to the degree to which white grievance and angry, sour nostalgia is part of his world view,” it stated. While admitting that Trump himself was not a white supremacist, the piece accused Trump of failing at “the simplest of political tests: finding a way to condemn Nazis” — the reason the US fought the last world war for. The act did earn him the praise of one: David Duke, former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

Trump’s U-turn has also rattled the Republican party and frustrated some White House aides. His Tuesday press conference was meant to showcase White House’s infrastructure plans, which ended up getting buried several feet under his fiery comments about Charlottesville. Many prominent Republican leaders and Trump critics have spoken out against his actions. This included senators John McCain, Lindsay Graham and his Primaries rivals, senators Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and John Kasich, to name a few. Former Republican governor of California, Arnold Schwarzeneggar released a video condemning the Nazis in the way that he felt Trump should have. Others like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have been more cautious by speaking out against white supremacy without addressing the President directly. Yet others, such as Vice-President Mike Pence, have chosen to stand by Trump.

Meanwhile, the Time magazine has not put Trump on its cover, but instead went for a figure wearing jackboots, with the American flag draped around its shoulder, giving a ‘Heil’ salute.

The first of this series titled Akele Nahin Hai Aap will be telecast by the national broadcaster on Sunday. It will feature the story of an abandoned father of seven, who finally found justice at the Lok Adalat.

The National Legal services Authority (NALSA) in association with Doordarshan has drawn up a series based on cases that were settled in National Lok Adalats held across the country. The object is to popularise alternative dispute resolution through Lok Adalats as this will help ease the burden on the judiciary,

The first of this series titled Akele Nahin Hai Aap will be telecast by the national broadcaster on Sunday. It will feature the story of an abandoned father of seven, who finally found justice at the Lok Adalat.

The elderly man approached the court, which referred the matter to Lok Adalat, where three of his sons finally agreed to pay him monthly maintenance of Rs 1,000 each and a fourth son agreed to take care of him.

“Akele Nahin Hain Aap is a series of 26 selected success stories of cases that have been settled in the three National Lok Adalats. The same is being produced by Doordarshan for NALSA”, a NALSA release said Saturday.

The project was conceptualised by Chief Justice of India designate Justice Dipak Misra, who is also Executive Chairman of NALSA.

“Through these episodes, a dramatised version of the success stories of cases which are or would be involved in litigation would be presented and it would be depicted how and in what manner the Lok Adalats came to their rescue and got the matters amicably settled between the parties,” the communication added.

"Karma Sutra: Seasons change, and so do life’s phases","Like the seasons, whenever our situation reaches its extreme, it is bound to turn around and change. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Like the seasons, whenever our situation reaches its extreme, it is bound to turn around and change. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Seasons change; the old leaves shed and the new ones crop up; winter gives way to spring and spring to summer and just when the scorching sun is beyond our endurance, the dark clouds rumble along and we survive these ever-changing, never stagnant seasons.

And so it is with our life. The phases of our life can easily be classified into favourable or unfavourable. The nature of our problems and the source of our unhappiness or contentment may vary but what remains constant is its cyclical nature. And yet, when we are passing through a phase, favourable or unfavourable, we assume it to be permanent. This causes us to lapse into either despair or complacency.

Our despair leads to frustration and anxiety while our complacency leads to arrogance and excesses. And one fine day, just like that, things begin to change; darkness gives way to dawn and dawn moves towards dusk. This visibility of light at the end of the tunnel helps us cover the rest of the ground in hope. It brings with it immense relief and gives is the strength to carry on.

As for those who are moving towards the dark tunnel and find themselves in a no man’s land, the change brings with it unrest and a shaking up of the very foundation on which our life runs. Since these phases are cyclical in nature and only the nature of our problems differs each time, we need to know as a rule of life that no phase lasts forever. Like the seasons, whenever our situation reaches its extreme, it is bound to turn around and change.

The Chinese illustrate this idea through their “Diagrams of the Supreme Ultimate”, which is also the grand leitmotiv of the Chinese culture. The diagram is a symmetric arrangement of dark (yin) and bright (yang). It is not static but rotational and shows the cyclical movement of the two forces of nature. The two dots in the diagram symbolise the idea that each time one of the two forces reaches its extreme it is bound to turn around and become its opposite.

(Source: hermetica.com) (Source: hermetica.com)

This belief has given them the courage and perseverance to ride out their unfavourable phase and made them cautious and modest during their favourable one.

The Taoist sage, however, believes that knowing the impermanence of the favourable and unfavourable one should not resist the flow but adapt one’s actions to it and strive to maintain a sense of equanimity through both.

"Top elephant conservationist shot dead in Tanzania, say colleagues","A leading conservationist who had worked hard to bring down notorious elephant poachers and stop ivory-trafficking, has been shot dead in Tanzania, his PAMS foundation has said. “We are heartbroken to share the news that PAMS Foundation co-founder, Wayne Lotter was shot and killed last night (Wednesday) in the Masaki District of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,” read a statement. The motive for the killing of the South African was unknown.

British primatologist and renowned environmentalist Jane Goodall described Lotter as her “hero”, a man who had faced “stiff opposition and personal threats” in his bid to protect Tanzania’s wildlife. PAMS finances Tanzania’s National and Transnational Serious Crimes Investigation Unit (NTSCIU) which has scored some massive successes in recent years, arresting nearly 900 poachers and illegal ivory traders. These include Chinese citizen Yang Fenlan known as the “Ivory Queen”, who is currently on trial in Tanzania for illegally trafficking 706 elephant tusks between 2000 and 2014.

In March Tanzania’s most notorious poacher, Boniface Matthew Maliango, commonly known as ‘The Devil’ was handed a 12-year prison sentence after his 2015 arrest by the NTSCIU. “There is no doubt in my mind but that Wayne’s anti poaching efforts made a big difference in the fight to save Tanzania’s elephants from the illegal ivory trade,” said Goodall.

Tanzania has been one of the worst hit by elephant poaching, losing over 66,000 elephants in the last decade, however PAMS believes there has been a “dramatic reduction” in such poaching since November 2014. “Wayne passionately believed in the importance of involving local communities in the protection of wildlife, and through his work with PAMS he helped train hundreds of village game scouts in many parts of the country,” said Goodall. “As a result he gained the support of many of the local people, but inevitably faced strong opposition from dealers and many high level government officials.”

Tanzanian police have launched an investigation into his death. “If this cowardly shooting was an attempt to bring the work of the PAMS Foundation to an end it will fail,” said Goodall.

Sino-India frictions raise potential for open conflict: CRS,"The two-page brief report by independent and bipartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) titled ‘China-Border Tensions at Doka La’ comes amidst continued standoff between the soldiers of two countries in the Sikkim sector. The two-page brief report by independent and bipartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) titled ‘China-Border Tensions at Doka La’ comes amidst continued standoff between the soldiers of two countries in the Sikkim sector.

Intensified frictions between India and China raise the potential for an open conflict and could serve as an “impetus” for further US-India strategic cooperation that could have implications for Beijing, according to a Congressional report.

The two-page brief report by independent and bipartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) titled ‘China-Border Tensions at Doka La’ comes amidst continued standoff between the soldiers of two countries in the Sikkim sector.

“Intensified frictions raise the potential for open conflict and could serve as an impetus for further US-India strategic cooperation that could have implications for China. An issue for Congress is whether to call on the Trump Administration to put forth a strategy and report on this strategic development,” the CRS said in its insight report.

CRS is an independent research wing of the US Congress, which prepares reports and policy papers for US lawmakers on issues of their interest for the Congressmen to take informed decision. Its reports are not considered as an official view of the US Congress.

The insight dated August 9 was released by non-profit Federation of American Scientists on Friday.

The US has maintained neutrality on the India-China border standoff and repeatedly encouraged the two countries to resolve their dispute through talks.

“Recent border tensions between India and China may be indicative of a new phase of heightened Sino-Indian rivalry. This rivalry is manifesting itself not only along the two nations’ 2,167-mile-long disputed Himalayan border, but also throughout South Asia and the broader Indian Ocean littoral region,” said the CRS insight authored by Bruce Vaughn.

A specialist in Asian Affairs, Vaughn notes that the border standoff at Doka La marks a shift in China-India ties that likely has more to do with the broader relationship than with the Himalayan border alone.

“An intensification of rivalry between China and India appears to be under way,” he wrote.

“For New Delhi, China’s efforts to block India from membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, develop the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor through a part of Kashmir (PoK) claimed by India, protect a Pakistan-based terrorist from UN sanctions, and develop China’s strategic presence in the Indian Ocean littoral have combined to increase New Delhi’s frustration with and suspicion of China,” Vaughn wrote.

“China has been wary of India’s decisions to not attend China’s Belt and Road summit in May 2017, allow the Dalai Lama to visit Arunachal Pradesh, and continue to develop strategic ties with the US. Given these larger dynamics, as well as specific statements and posturing on Doka La, it may be some time before the dispute is fully resolved,” the report concluded.

Hong Kong legal chief denies political motive in jailings as criticism mounts,"Student leaders Lester Shum, Nathan Law and Alex Chow hug as they arrive at the High Court to face verdict on charges relating to the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement, also known as Occupy Central protests, in Hong Kong, China August 17, 2017. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu Student leaders Lester Shum, Nathan Law and Alex Chow hug as they arrive at the High Court to face verdict on charges relating to the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement, also known as Occupy Central protests, in Hong Kong, China August 17, 2017. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu

Hong Kong’s legal chief denied any “political motive” in seeking jail for three young pro-democracy activists on Friday, responding to a Reuters report that he had overruled other legal officials who had initially advised against pursuing the case. An appeals court on Thursday jailed three leaders of the Chinese-ruled city’s democracy movement, Joshua Wong, 20, Alex Chow, 27, and Nathan Law, 24, for six to eight months, dealing a blow to a youth-led push for universal suffrage. Several protests by their supporters are planned in coming days.

They had been convicted of unlawful assembly related to months of mostly peaceful street protests that gripped the city in 2014 but failed to sway Communist Party rulers in Beijing in their call for full democracy. The trio had already been sentenced last year by a district court in the former British colony to non-jail terms including community service, but the Department of Justice applied for a review, seeking jail terms.

Reuters reported that Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen had ignored the advice of several senior prosecutors in the Department of Justice in pushing for jail terms. Yuen said differences of opinion could be constructive. “I believe everyone will understand that any entity, including a government department, in discussing something, will sometimes have a consensus, and sometimes there are different opinions,” he told reporters. “I hope everyone can understand that the main point is not whether there was any difference in opinion, and actually sometimes having a difference in opinion is a good thing, because if everyone has the same opinion then you can’t have a constructive discussion.”

Yuen added there “hasn’t been any political motive at all” in the case. China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said in response to the sentences that “no one can use the excuse of so-called democracy and freedom to carry out illegal violent acts”.

INTERNATIONAL CONCERN

But the sentencing has stoked broader international fears for Hong Kong’s constitutionally enshrined freedoms, part of a “one country, two systems” deal under which the British returned the territory to China in 1997, as well as perceptions of political meddling. Hong Kong enjoys a free, highly respected judiciary, unlike on the mainland where the Communist Party controls the courts which rarely challenge its decisions.

“We are concerned by the decision of the Hong Kong authorities to seek a tougher sentence,” said Kristin Haworth, a spokesperson for the US Consulate General Hong Kong and Macau. “We hope Hong Kong’s law enforcement continues to reflect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and remains apolitical.”

US House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called the re-sentencing of the trio “unjust”. “This injustice offends the basic notions of freedom and democracy and deserves the swift and unified condemnation of the international community,” she said in a statement.

US senator and once presidential hopeful Marco Rubio, together with representative Chris Smith, also criticized what they called the “shameful” sentencing. Their statement drew ire from the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s representative office in Hong Kong.

“We ask the US government to follow the basic principles of international relations, and oppose and stop the aforementioned congressmen’s speech and action that oppose China and stir up troubles in Hong Kong,” the office said in a statement. Britain said it was vital Hong Kong’s young people had a voice in politics and it hoped the sentencing would not discourage legitimate protest. The office of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen expressed “much regret” over the sentence.

China’s conservative state-run tabloid, the Global Times, welcomed the jail terms, saying “the law has shown its authority”. “This sentence will be a milestone in Hong Kong’s governance. From now on people who protest violently can be given a guilty sentence following this precedent, and they will need to go to jail,” the newspaper wrote.

The jail terms disqualify Wong, Chow and Law from running for the financial hub’s legislature for the next five years. Law had been the city’s youngest ever democratically elected legislator before he was stripped last month of his seat by a government-led lawsuit. The three plan to appeal.

"US: Helicopter crew had life vests, air bottles during crash","A UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter aircrew from Wheeler Army Airfield and a fireboat crew from the Honolulu Fire Department conduct a search for five crew members aboard a downed Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter on Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017. (Petty Officer 2nd Class Tara Molle/U.S. Coast Guard via AP) A UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter aircrew from Wheeler Army Airfield and a fireboat crew from the Honolulu Fire Department conduct a search for five crew members aboard a downed Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter on Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017. (Petty Officer 2nd Class Tara Molle/U.S. Coast Guard via AP)

All five crew members aboard a Black Hawk helicopter that crashed over the Pacific had life vests and an air bottle for underwater breathing, but Army officials and rescuers searching the turbulent waters off Hawaii for days had not seen signs of life as of late Friday. Crews of Black Hawk helicopters undergo underwater crash and survival training before they come to Hawaii, said Master Sgt. Peter Mayes, a spokesperson for the 25th Infantry Division. Soldiers simulate being on board a helicopter that’s crashed into the water and learn how to free themselves.

Mayes said there was no life raft on board the helicopter because operating procedure only calls for rafts when non-crew member soldiers or people without life vests are on board. Army officials have spent days sifting through chunks of helicopter debris since the aircraft crashed during nighttime training on Tuesday.

The US Coast Guard said Friday it is searching up to 50 miles (80 kilometers) off the remote point where the UH-60 helicopter crashed west of Oahu.

Firefighters found and collected what appeared to be pieces of helicopter fuselage and a helmet earlier in the week. The Coast Guard said responders continue to find debris, but didn’t have specifics on what kind. The Navy brought remotely operated underwater vehicles and sonar to help. On Friday, they searched waters about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) off the coast, said Lt. Col. Curtis Kellogg, a spokesman for the Army’s 25th Infantry Division.

Shifting waters and swift currents spread debris from 2 miles (3 kilometers) off shore on Tuesday night to an expanded search area of at least 50 miles (80 kilometers) on Thursday. The ocean floor drops quickly off Oahu and varies throughout the search area. It is over 1,000 feet (300 meters) deep at the center of a safety zone established by the Coast Guard for the search.

The safety zone extends from a 5-mile (8-kilometer) radius around the last known location of the helicopter. The Coast Guard set it up because it’s likely to have a higher concentration of debris and be where most of the search aircraft and vessels are operating. It’s not allowing civilians to enter the area.

A Coast Guard HC-130 plane helping with the search was using radar that’s designed to search the surface of the ocean, said spokeswoman Chief Petty Officer Sara Muir. An MH-65 helicopter was using infrared technology, she said. Asked whether sharks would be a concern, Muir said there were marine predators in the area. “That is expected and perfectly normal for this region,” she said.

Mario Vittone, a retired Coast Guardsman and expert on sea survival, said how long people survive in the water depends on their age, weight and health in addition to water and air temperatures. Searches in colder climates where water drops below 60 degrees (15 degrees Celsius) may get called off after a day. In Hawaii, they often last longer. Last year, a search for 12 Marines who went missing after two helicopters collided off Hawaii lasted five days. Remains of nine Marines were found. Three were never recovered.

The recovery of debris indicates the Black Hawk hit the water uncontrolled, Vittone said. This would mean there’s a low probability anyone survived but he said the rescuers can’t and don’t assume that. The two Black Hawk crews were conducting training between Kaena Point and Dillingham Airfield when communications were lost. The two helicopters are part of the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade based in Hawaii.

Mo Farah bids to give British fans memorable farewell,"Mo Farah admits Sunday’s race will have his emotions in turmoil. (Source: AP) Mo Farah admits Sunday’s race will have his emotions in turmoil. (Source: AP)

British athletics great Mo Farah will hope his final track race on home turf on Sunday will have a happier ending than last Saturday’s world 5,000 metres final.

The 34-year-old, who will compete in the 3,000 metres at the Diamond League meeting in Birmingham, produced a courageous performance just falling short of overhauling Ethiopian Muktar Edris.

That defeat, his first since the 10,000m in the 2011 world championships, ended a remarkable run of global titles in which he upset the Kenyan/Ethiopian hegemony in distance races and included achieving the 5,000/10,000 double in successive Olympics.

Farah, who came to England aged eight with his mother and two of his brothers after a long trek from war-torn Somalia, is assured of a warm reception from the spectators if not from the press at whom he fired a blast after his 5,000m defeat.

His relations with large parts of the British media have deteriorated over the years because of his association with controversial coach Alberto Salazar.

The spectators, though, have largely given him the benefit of the doubt and Farah admits Sunday’s race will have his emotions in turmoil.

“It’s definitely going to be emotional,” said Farah, who will make his final track appearance in the Zurich Diamond League meet next week.

“I’ve had a long career and to come here year after year, it’s been something special. “But, at some point, anything we do in life must come to an end and this is it. I just have to take care of the race and respect my opposition. I have a job to do Sunday and to do well.”

Farah is intent on not letting the occasion get to him and believes he is still in fine fettle despite his exertions in London at the world championships.”It’s important for me to go out with a win,” he said. “I think people realise that it’s not as easy as me just

turning up, you’ve got to be in the best shape. I’m in great shape and if I could come away with a win that would be great.”

‘Greatest distance athlete of all time’

Farah can also perhaps expect a surprise from UK Athletics after he has crossed the line judging from what their chief executive Niels de Vos said. “Mo Farah is thought by many commentators to be the greatest distance athlete of all time,” said de Vos.

“I could not agree more. We are planning to commemorate his final track race in the UK in style on Sunday in what will be one of the highlights of the summer.”

In truth the field lining up against Farah should not present any problems but other events on the card have a far more competitive edge. None more so than the women’s 100 metres which sees Olympic champion Elaine Thompson try and restore some of her lustre after flopping in the world final.

However, bitter rival Dafne Schippers, who finished in front of her in the 100m as she took bronze and boosted by retaining her 200m crown, will be intent on denting the Jamaican’s morale further.

Dual sprint world silver medalist Marie-Josee Ta Lou also lines up as does Australian great Sally Pearson, fresh from her remarkable comeback to regain the 100m hurdles world crown.

"Raksha Bandhan 2017: Know the Importance, History and Significance of Raksha Bandhan Festival in India","There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia) There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia)

India as we know has a rich cultural heritage and while there are many festivals observed throughout the year, Raksha Bandhan holds a special place. It is the time when siblings celebrate the special bond of love between them. Sisters tie a thread/band around their brother’s wrist for his long life and happiness and in exchange he promises to protect his sibling from all evils. This year, Raksha Bandhan will be observed on August 7.

Origin of Raksha Bandhan

The exact origin of the festival that is celebrated joyously in India and Nepal is unknown, but there are are many interesting stories associated with it. The most popular one is from the Mahabharata and it acknowledges the relationship between Lord Krishna and Draupadi. According to the epic, one morning, when Lord Krishna was flying a kite, he cut his finger on the abrasive string. Draupadi, who was nearby, saw him bleeding profusely and ran to him. She then tore a piece from her sari and tied it around his finger. Lord Krishna was so touched that in return he promised to protect her from all evil, forever. And he did protect her all along, especially during her ‘cheerharan’ by the Kauravas.

There’s another interesting story involving Emperor Humayun and Rani Karnavati of Mewar. When Mewar was attacked twice by Bahadur Shah Zafar in the mid 16th century, she sent a letter with a rakhi to Humayun as a last resort, to help her. The emperor was so touched by the gesture that he immediately left the military campaign he was then involved in to protect her.

Interesting rituals

There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother’s wrist. In some parts of India, families draw figures and symbols on the walls of their homes and worship them with offerings of vermilion and kheer. Palm imprints are also used to decorate the entrance of a household where rakhis are stuck.

Survivors picking through the debris of Sierra Leone’s deadly mudslides are facing the reality that most, if not all, of the estimated 600 people missing are dead. The death toll is already above 450 from the flooding and mudslides in the capital, Freetown, early Monday.

Large-scale-burials have begun amid rainy weather and the threat of further mudslides. Rescue officials have warned that the chances of finding survivors “are getting smaller every day.”

The government in recent days has warned residents to evacuate a mountainside where a large crack has opened. Authorities have told local media that thousands of people live in areas at risk, and the main focus is making sure people leave before further disaster.

Bodies have been washing up on shore in the seaside city.

Barcelona terror attack: Spain maintains alert level with reinforced security measures,"Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain’s King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain’s King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

The Spanish government decided to maintain its anti-terrorism alert level at 4 but pledged to reinforce security measures at the same time, the Interior Ministry said. The decision was made during an anti-terror meeting on Saturday chaired by Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido in the morning, Xinhua news agency reported.

A total of 14 fatalities occurred in two terrorist attacks in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Cambrils that also hurt about 126 people of 34 different nationalities. Thirteen people were killed on Thursday afternoon in the popular Las Ramblas area of Barcelona when a white van zigzagged at high speed down the busy avenue thronged with tourists, knocking down pedestrians.

On early Friday morning, the fourteenth victim, a woman, was stabbed when five people jumped out of a car and began attacking people at random on the seaside promenade in Cambrils, a town south of Barcelona. Spanish police gunned down all five attackers. Six others were also injured in the attack. As of Saturday morning, 54 injured people are still hospitalized with 12 of them in critical condition, according to Catalan emergency services.

Government of Catalonia considers the terrorist cell responsible for the double-attack has not been totally destroyed as some attackers are still at large, Catalan Minister of the Interior Joaquim Forn told reporters. “We are optimistic, but the searching operation conducted by the Mossos (police authority in Catalonia) can not be considered as finished until we determine and stop all the people who are members of the cell,” said Forn.

Meanwhile, Spanish authorities identified one fugitive terrorist as Younes Abouyaaqoub. Police are searching for the 23-year-old Moroccan in Ripoll near Barcelona. The suspect has been wanted by Interpol prior to the double attacks. Confusion still reigns over the identity of the van attack driver. The police firstly thought the driver was Moussa Oukabir, one of the terrorists gunned down in Cambrils, and later they turned their attention to Younes Abouyaaqoub.

Police authorities in Catalonia said that they are ruling out the possibility that the van’s driver would join the group that carried out the attack in Cambrils. So far, four people have been arrested and are being questioned by police.

"Batting at No. 5 or 6 was a new challenge for me against New Zealand, says Manish Pandey","Manish Pandey hopes to hit the ground running after playing in South Africa earlier in the month. (Source: AP) Manish Pandey hopes to hit the ground running after playing in South Africa earlier in the month. (Source: AP)

Manish Pandey is in an unfamiliar territory going against Sri Lanka in the ODI series. He has played at No 4 spot throughout his career but now he has to get accustomed to playing fewer overs and possibly coming out and going all guns blazing if required. This isn’t the first series for him in this spot as he had already played at five-down against New Zealand back in India. KL Rahul will hold the No 4 spot, chief selector MSK Prasad had confirmed.

“The game I played in Australia, I batted No.4. That’s where I have batted my entire career. There (at that position) you know how many overs you have to play. But if the team thinks somebody else can perform that role, it is fine. KL (Rahul) played really well in the Tests and I would love to see that repeated in ODIs, too,” said Pandey after the practice session on Friday.

“Batting at No.5 or 6 was a new challenge for me during the home series against New Zealand (last year). It took me some time to get used to the situation with only around 15-odd overs left in the game. You just don’t have the time to settle down in that position. You need to go hard from the first ball. I think, I adapted quite well. Let’s see how it goes this time.”

Pandey comes into the series after playing for India A against South Africa A and Afghanistan A in the tri-nation series which India A won. The conditions will be extremely different but Pandey hopes to get used to things quickly after a short break. “I had a decent break of about five-six days at home. Conditions in Sri Lanka are similar to those in India. We all have played in these conditions before and I am just raring to go,” he said.

He also looked back at the period where he had to stay on the sidelines – not due to form but injury. “It was really tough. Being left out of action when you are not in form doesn’t really hurt that much as when you’re doing well and suddenly get injured. But you have to take that in your stride and that’s the time when you get to learn more about your body and also learn how to work on it,” he said.

“I had about six weeks to work on myself and do a couple of things I had to do. It was good for me in a way but obviously I’m a little disappointed about the time it (injury) happened. But it’s always good to come back. I had a good outing with India ‘A’ and the team did really well, so I’m pretty happy,” he added.

Antonio Conte envies Tottenham Hotspur’s firm foundations,"Antonio Conte admitted he may have to use one or two players who were not 100 percent match fit. (Source: Reuters) Antonio Conte admitted he may have to use one or two players who were not 100 percent match fit. (Source: Reuters)

Chelsea manager Antonio Conte envies bitter London rivals Tottenham Hotspur despite having pipped them for the Premier League title last season.

He told a news conference on Friday — ahead of Sunday’s league meeting at Wembley — that opposite number Mauricio Pochettino has built the sort of solid foundation that Chelsea need to do again after losing a number of experienced players.

“He created a great foundation for his club and we must do the same,” Conte said. “I want to help my club to build the same solid foundation. We lost a lot of players in the last few years who created this basis for us.”

In the shorter term, the manager must work out what his strongest team is to face Tottenham, with captain Gary Cahill and midfielder Cesc Fabregas suspended and Eden Hazard and Pedro among those who have been injured.

Conte admitted he may have to use one or two players who were not 100 percent match fit, including new signings Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid and Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco.

“I have to make difficult decisions,” he added. “Bakayoko is improving and could be in contention. “When you try to put players in too soon the risk of injury is high.”

Chelsea lost their first game of the season for the first time in almost 20 years when Burnley shocked them 3-2 at Stamford Bridge last Saturday after Cahill and Fabregas were both sent off.

They generally enjoy meeting their London rivals, having beaten them more times than any other Premier League opponents, as well as inflicting a 4-2 defeat on them at Wembley in last season’s FA Cup semi-final.

If Conte is happy with the venue, where Spurs are playing all their league games this season while White Hart Lane is rebuilt, however, he does not welcome the fixture coming at a time when Chelsea’s playing resources are so stretched.

“I don’t think it’s a good time to play against them,” he said. “I knew this season would be very difficult for us. Last season we won the league and reached the FA Cup semi-final with only 13 players playing regularly.

“We were lucky not to have injuries but this season we lost players. “It’s not easy but we must be strong to face this situation and it’s very important I don’t find excuses.”

"Paper Miracles: Sanjhi, the ancient art of hand cutting stencils from paper, gets a contemporary twist in an exhibition","Works from the exhibition “Sanjhi Revisted” Works from the exhibition “Sanjhi Revisted”

After many requests from curious onlookers, a fourth generation Sanjhi artist — Mohan Kumar Verma from Mathura — cuts a bird with flared wings taking flight. He does it with the help of handmade scissors and a tiny sheet of plucked paper with lightning fast speed. “This is all that I learnt from our grandfather. I’d lost my father and needed to support my family financially while other children of my age studied,” says the 48-year-old artist, who was showcasing the art of Sanjhi and depicting his works in the exhibition “Sanjhi Revisited” at Delhi’s Visual Arts Gallery, India Habitat Centre. The exhibition has been brought together by Delhi Crafts Council to celebrate their golden jubilee year. Over 80 artwork on display include depiction of domes flanked by minarets, decorated with designs of weeping willow, as clouds resembling Aladdin’s magical lamp hover from above. There is also a reinterpretion of Mughal garden illustrations from Good Earth’s coloring book Bagh-e-Bahar by another Sanjhi artist, Ashutosh Verma.

Sanjhi, the art of handcutting stencils from paper, is believed to have emerged over a 100 years ago as part of ritual decorations in the temples of Mathura and Vrindavan. The stencils depicting legends and pilgrimage locations associated with the life of Krishna are used to create intricate floor patterns or rangoli using coloured powder.

Purnima Rai, head of the organising committee and former President of Delhi Crafts Council, says, “With architecture as one of the many themes in the exhibition, the artists have portrayed buildings used in traditional Sanjhi, and reproduced several other architectural designs. Art is currently in a flux and its various possibilities need to reach out to more people. This show is a step in that direction.”

With the help of handmade paper, banana rice paper and jute paper, Mohan has replicated Mughal jali works inspired by the designs found in classic Mughal architecture, against the backdrop of a mirror. Artist Ram Soni has extensively cut out a series of illustrations of vases, spilling with flowers, out of silver foil, displayed against a deep blue colored backdrop. In Bamboo with Parrots, Soni has captured a parrot in a variety of postures while sitting atop a stylised bamboo tree — looking up at the sky and into the oblivion, searching for food and engaging with its counterpart.

As the craft enveloped into a declining phase in the early 20th century, where only a few temples in Vrindavan practiced it, the efforts of designers and NGOs including Delhi Crafts Council in recent decades have ensured a resurgence of the craft. Mohan says, “Almost 25 years ago, when I was invited at the National Crafts Museum in Delhi to display my products, no one was really willing to buy them. Even if a sheet of artwork paper was priced for Rs 100, people would question us and ask why it deserved to be sold at such a high price. It was demotivating and I had almost thought of quitting the profession. But as Delhi Crafts Council pushed us to bring in modern interpretations on coasters, lamps and wedding invitation cards, our craft flourished.” Mohan points out that he had even designed an entire wedding tent using Sanjhi art in Delhi and a pandal for Durga Puja in Kolkata a few years ago, where the exteriors of the pandal and the jewellery and clothing of the goddess was made of paper cut stencils. With most of the pieces at the exhibition now bearing a circled red mark and few works priced over a lakh, they only serve as a positive sign of a brighter future for the ancient artform.

The exhibition is on at Visual Arts Gallery, India Habitat Centre, Lodhi Road, till August 12

Stephen Hawking blames UK government for health service ”crisis’ in United Kingdom,"Hawking, a supporter of the opposition Labour Party, said the NHS was “a cornerstone of our society” but was in crisis created by political decisions. (File Photo) Hawking, a supporter of the opposition Labour Party, said the NHS was “a cornerstone of our society” but was in crisis created by political decisions. (File Photo)

Physicist Stephen Hawking has criticised the British government for causing a crisis in the state-run National Health Service (NHS), saying it had to be protected from becoming a profit-making U.S.-style system. Writing in the Guardian newspaper, the British cosmologist, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease aged 21, also accused Britain’s health minister of cherry-picking scientific evidence to justify policies.

“The care I have received since being diagnosed with motor neurone disease as a student in 1962 has enabled me to live my life as I want, and to contribute to major advances in our understanding of the universe,” wrote Hawking, author of the bestselling book ‘A Brief History of Time’. Founded in 1948, the NHS is a source of huge pride for many Britons who are able to access free care from the cradle to the grave, but in recent years tight budgets, an ageing population and more expensive, complex treatments has put the system under huge financial strain.

Hawking, a supporter of the opposition Labour Party, said the NHS was “a cornerstone of our society” but was in crisis created by political decisions.

It was also facing a conflict between the interests of multinational corporations driven by profit and public opposition to increasing privatisation, he said. “In the U.S., where they are dominant in the healthcare system, these corporations make enormous profits, healthcare is not universal, and it is hugely more expensive for the outcomes patients receive than in the UK,” he wrote.

“We see the balance of power in the UK is with private healthcare companies, and the direction of change is towards a U.S.-style insurance system.”

Last year, English doctors staged their first strikes in four decades over government plans to reform pay and conditions as part of moves to deliver what it said would be a consistent service seven days a week as studies showed mortality rates were higher at weekends when staffing is reduced.

However, Hawking, who communicates via a cheek muscle linked to a sensor and computerised voice system, said Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had cherry-picked research to justify his arguments.

“For a scientist, cherry-picking evidence is unacceptable. When public figures abuse scientific argument, citing some studies but suppressing others to justify policies they want to implement for other reasons, it debases scientific culture,” he wrote. Hunt responded on Twitter saying no health secretary could ignore the evidence. “Stephen Hawking is brilliant physicist but wrong on lack of evidence 4 weekend effect,” Hunt wrote.

Laila Rouass, a 46-year -old Indian-origin television actress in the UK, hid in a restaurant freezer in an attempt to protect herself during the Barcelona terror attack in Spain on Thursday. The actress tweeted live updates from Las Ramblas area of the city where she was on a holiday with her 10-year-old daughter Inez Khan.

“In the middle of the attack. Hiding in a restaurant freezer. Happened so fast. Praying for the safety of everyone here,” was her first tweet about the attack which saw a white van plowed into people in Barcelona, killing 14 and injuring over 100. Rouass is a popular star on British television who has appeared on shows such as ‘Footballers’ Wives’ and ‘Holby City’. She began her TV career in India during the 1990s as a VJ on Channel V.

“Gunshots just heard. Armed police running down the street looking for someone,” she tweeted next. Born to a Moroccan father and Indian mother, Rouass is married to British snooker player Ronnie O’Sullivan. “The whole of Las Ramblas and surrounding roads in lock down with armed police everywhere,” she tweeted some time later.

"Dalits versus Dalits in Gujarat villages, as men kill youth for ‘helping’ eloping couple","Parents of Kanu Parmar, who has eloped. Express Parents of Kanu Parmar, who has eloped. Express

Days after Kiran Parmar, a 21-year-old orphan from Dalvana in Gujarat’s Banaskantha district was killed — allegedly beaten to death for “facilitating” eloping of a couple from neighbouring Varvadiya — decades-old affinity between people of the two villages are at a breaking point. Kiran, who worked as a waiter in a Surat hotel and had come home to take part in a fair, was a Dalit — as are the couple who have eloped, and many of those arrested for his murder on August 15.

Banaskantha police say this is one of the trickiest case registered under the Atrocities Act in the district in recent times. “We made immediate arrests and are now looking for the 17-year old girl (name withheld) and Kanu Parmar, who have eloped,” Banaskantha’s Superintendent of Police (SP) Neeraj Badgujar said.

Deputy SP of Palanpur (SC/ST cell) Hetal Patel, who is leading the probe, said the elopement caused a rift in Dalit communities of the villages — many of the residents are related by marriage — and the murder “has made matters worse”. “Kiran died when he was beaten — brutally — for the second time by men from his own community from Varvadia village,” Patel added.

Those arrested are Ramesh Parmar, Talshi Parmar, Babu Parmar, Ishwar Parmar, Ashok Parmar, Ramesh Parmar, Vira Parmar and Ramesh Dharma Parmar — all from Varvadiya village, where the eloped couple come from — besides Nayan Rabari and his accomplices Vijay Padhiyar from Vadodara and Vishnu Rabari, Mukesh Rabari, Umang Rabari and Vishwas Rabari, all residents of Ahmedabad

“Kiran, 21, and Kanu, 19 (who eloped with the girl), grew up together and were friends. Kiran had come down from Surat for satam mela (a popular fair). He went to the fair with Kanu and the girl, and someone saw them together there,” said Jetha Parmar, a retired police inspector and Kiran’s uncle.

That report that went out, it appears, as Kiran left for Surat after the fair “but the girl and Kanu did not return home”, Jetha Parmar said. Kiran was heading for Surat in a bus, when Parmars from the girl’s village learnt that he was the last person who was with the couple, and imagined he “facilitated” their elopement. They gave the bus a chase, but unable to stop it, the girl’s father rung up his employer, Amumiyan Lohani, a Vadodara-based businessman, the police said. “Lohani called some friends for help, and his Facebook friend Nayan Rabari responded,” DySP Hetal Patel said.

According to police, Lohani told Rabari about Kiran and sent his picture on WhatsApp, asking him to stop the bus and intercept the young man. Rabari, who was under the impression that the girl was from his own community, intercepted, beat Kiran brutally to “teach him a lesson” and subsequently handed him over to the Parmars of Varvadia, who got him to Vadodara in a car, SP Badgujar said. Kiran Parmar died on the way — the postmortem records cerebral haemorrhage as the cause of death.

Kanu and the girl both belong to Varvadi village — neighbours and distantly related, Jetha said. “Varvadi and our village, Dalvana, have a history of friendship — we, Parmars, from each village have married our daughters to boys from the other. But this incident will change everything,” he said.

Kiran’s younger sister Asha Parmar told The Indian Express, “My brother is dead, and we will not get him back. All I hope now is Kanubhai and the girl are not killed once they are found.”

At Dalvana, 5 km from Varvadia, the girl’s mother, Geeta, said, “I do not want to see my daughter again. She has humiliated us… she is dead for me. She grew up with Kanu, my cousin’s son. How could they run away, and in the process an innocent Kiran was killed.” Kanu’s parents, Vasa and Ratna Parmar, have left home after their son eloped and are staying in a cowshed on the outskirts of the village at present. “We cannot face our community after what our son has done. Our elder son Ramesh is in jail, as he also joined the men in finding Kiran,” Vasa Parmar said.

"Gorakhpur hospital tragedy: Midnight, Ward No. 100","Relatives of patients in Ward No. 100 grabbing any place in the building complex to rest for brief snatches at night, in between tending to their children.Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav Relatives of patients in Ward No. 100 grabbing any place in the building complex to rest for brief snatches at night, in between tending to their children.Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav

AS THE clock strikes midnight on Thursday, August 17, parents and family members gathered outside Ward No. 100 of BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur, start staking out the corridors, the stairs, the portico.

They must act fast.

In hardly five minutes, all the space in this paediatric building complex — housing the beds, the hospital’s Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) as well as Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) — that has seen over 150 deaths so far this month, is taken. The attendants are spread out on pieces of cloth and plastic that they have fished out. Just long enough and wide enough to hold them. Others lean against paan-stained walls.

Sleep is another matter though. Most are here in pairs, and take turns attending to their children. All through the night, they keep getting up to relieve the other, or to peek inside through the glass walls of the ward’s blocks for news. Inside, the attendants stand, or perch themselves on beds being already shared by two children in many cases. At night, there are on an average one doctor and one nurse plus two paramedics in each of the blocks, with 12 beds each, that the ward is divided into.

The heat and humidity are oppressive, the only thing stirring the still air are a few hand-held fans being wielded by weary hands and the faint cries of infants that travel outside.

Around 2.15 am, there is welcome relief. A boy in his early 20s has entered the ward premises, carrying a huge kettle. As he shouts out “chaaiii…”, parents rush for the Rs 5 “masala aur nimbu” tea. It is partly to fight sleep, partly to quench hunger (most had their last meal at 7 or 8 pm, in the private canteens that have sprung up on the hospital campus).

As they sip the tea gratefully, a parent helpfully tells another he can find a used plastic sheet to sleep near the rain basera (night shelter) for just Rs 20.

An hour later, the tea boy returns, expecting to find more customers. But before he can say anything, the peace of the night is broken by the sound of loud crying. All those who hear know without being told what has happened, and where. Some lie back down, others watch in silence as a young man comes down minutes later from the NICU on the first floor and walks past carrying what looks like a newborn in a pink colour towel.

Over 50 per cent of the deaths taking place in Ward No. 100 are NICU deaths, though the government has denied that any of these deaths were related to shortage of oxygen supply, which the hospital faced on August 10 and 11.

While the father of the dead infant is stunned into silence, a woman who identifies herself as Asha and his aunt says the boy was delivered just an hour back at a hospital in Brahmpur block of Gorakhpur. Since he had difficulty breathing and the hospital did not have a ventilator, the infant was referred to BRD Medical College. He was dead by the time he reached.

To provide better health facilities and reduce the large number of deaths of children in the region, the Uttar Pradesh government had allotted Rs 18 crore for construction of a ‘100-bed new ward’ at Baba Raghav Das Medical College, Gorakhpur, six years ago.

Ward No. 100, so called for its 100 beds, is that ward. It’s also called ‘Mastishk Jwar or Brain Fever’ (as it treats mostly encephalitis cases) ward. Long before the night the country’s attention was drawn to it, parents like the one here this Thursday night started calling it by another name: ‘Mratak lok (place of the dead)’.

For most of them, BRD Medical College is not their first option. But, they fear, it could be their last. Tonight too, there will be deaths — between noon on August 17 and noon August 18, nine died in the ward, hospital records will later show. Five in NICU, four in PICU, at least two due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).

Roshantara, 5

Siwan, Bihar

Father Shamim makes around Rs 7,000 per month from a small agricultural plot

At 12.20 am, Shamim, 34, comes out limping from the NICU. Rushing towards the end of the corridor, he fills water in a green plastic tumbler from an overflowing washbasin. A vendor offers him tea, but Shamim brushes him away: “Kuchch khana peena nahin hai (I don’t want anything to eat or drink).” He rushes back to Roshantara.

The five-year-old has AES, with high-grade fever, headache, nausea and convulsions. Shamim says they came on August 14 from Siwan, 130 km away, due to “lack of facilities” in the district. “I have another daughter, who is one. Her mother has to take care of her. I have come alone with my daughter. The doctors visit once an hour. That is the best a poor man can ask,” says Shamim.

He takes out a piece of cloth, dips it in the tumbler of water and uses it to sponge Roshantara. With just one nurse and doctor around, Shamim, like most of the attendants inside, are on their own.

The washbasin from where Shamim collected the water has a handle broken and is filled with waste that people have thrown in. The three dustbins inside the ward premises, next to the toilet and right adjacent to the ward, are also overflowing, including with biomedical waste.

Shamim hasn’t given a thought to all the germs he may have brought back in his dash to the washbasin. An ICU dealing with encephalitis patients is mandated to only use disinfected water. There is no hand sanitiser around, and none of the attendants are wearing any isolation gowns, masks, gloves or shoe covers, which is also a must in ICUs as per the National Centre for Disease Control.

Roshantara is sleeping on a plastic sheet, spread over the bed, bought by her father for Rs 20. The same is true for almost all the children in the block. Urinary tract infection is a common infection acquired by children inside ICU, and using sanitised bedspreads is one way to prevent it.

Aman, 1

Nahar Chapra village, Padrauna, Kushinagar district

Shriram Kushwaha, a labourer on construction sites, earns about Rs 6000-9000 a month

When 13-month-old Aman developed rashes last Saturday, the first person his family approached was a quack in the neighbouring market, who did jhar-phoonk, told them that his condition was due to “devi naraj”, and asked them to wait till the spirit’s anger subsided.

It was only when the child began having convulsions that they took him to a private doctor in Kushinagar town, about 18 km from their village. When Aman’s deteriorated further, the doctor asked the family to take him to a facility with better medical care.

Aman’s father Shriram Kushwaha says he had heard of the deaths and hence was reluctant to bring the child to Gorakhpur initially, but gave in after the private doctor expressed helplessness. “Jab jhatka khane laga to ghabra gaya sab log. Yahan nahin to kaha jate?… Wahan se private bus kiya, do hazar rupey udhari liya… aur char ghanta chalke medical aaya (When the child began having seizures, we got scared. Where else we could have gone if not here?… We then took a private bus, borrowed Rs 2,000 and got here after a four-hour journey),” says Shriram, who reached Gorakhpur on August 16.

Doctors have told the family that Aman’s condition is stable but are not sure of what ails him.

It’s 3 am in the morning when Shriram wakes up wife Indrawati, who is sleeping on a plastic sheet in the corridor, to ask her to sponge the child. Indrawati has slept for just two hours.

“Yahan to yahi jindagi hai, khana khane ka samay bhi nahin mil pata (This is our routine here. We do not get time for even food),” she says.

Aradhya, 5

Rampur village, Gorakhpur

Father Bhupendar works in Delhi at a paper factory, earning 1,000 per month

Aradhna’s aunt Anupa says Bhupendar won’t enter her room in Ward No. 100.

“He is very weak-hearted. Aradhya is still not recognising anyone, and her father is not able to handle it. He sits outside the whole day but won’t enter. Only this evening she drank some milk. Doctors say she will start responding tomorrow,” says Anupa. Aradhya’s mother couldn’t come as she is expecting another child.

The Uttar Pradesh government claims that almost 80 per cent of its children have been successfully vaccinated. Not Aradhya, says Bhupendar. No health worker ever visited the girl. The primary health centre (PHC) in their village Rampur has been “locked since years”, he says.

Apart from Anura, Aradhya’s uncle Jitender (Bhupendar’s younger brother) takes care of the girl inside the ward. With Bhupendar away in Delhi working, it is Jitender who had rushed Aradhya to a private hospital near the Gorakhnath temple when she fell ill.

When the doctor said he couldn’t help, on August 14, they came to BRD.

At 3.30 am, Jitender comes out of the ward for a brief break, and bursts into tears. “Aradhya is the most loved person in the family. She was born eight years after my brother’s marriage. I am married but I still don’t have children. She is the only child of our family. We just pray that everything returns to normal,” says the 28-year-old.

But what is normal, he goes on to ask. “It is only here that we came to know there is a vaccination to prevent such fever (acute encephalitis syndrome). No health worker ever came to us for any vaccination or immunisation. Our PHC is shut for years. I feel cheated by the government.”

Astha, 17 months

Bahai village, Sant Kabir Nagar district, UP

Father Ram Shankar Mishra, a priest, earns Rs 3,000-Rs 6,000 a month

Sitting beside granddaughter Astha and constantly fending off sleep, Dheerendra Prasad Mishra, 60, has his eyes on the monitor that keeps track of her vital signs.

It’s 1 am and Dheerendra’s turn to ensure that the infant, currently on life support, does not disturb the oxygen pipe supporting her, with her hands. Astha’s parents, father Ram Shankar Mishra, a priest at their village in Sant Kabir Nagar, and mother Anju, had been nursing her the entire day but have just found place to rest in the corridor, adjacent to the pharmacy of the ward.

Since her birth, about a month and a half ago, Astha has spent most of her time in hospitals. Ravi Shankar, who arrives to relieve his father at 2 am, says she was just four days old when she began having difficulty breathing and appeared to have congestion in her chest.

Shankar says he first took Astha to the district hospital in Sant Kabir Nagar where she was born, before shuttling her between two private doctors.

He says that one of the doctors told him that she had pneumonia, while the other said water had entered her mouth during delivery. With her condition deteriorating, doctors asked him to shift her to Gorakhpur, about 37 km from their village.

The family landed here on the morning of August 11, when the death toll of 30 in two days set off alarm bells. Doctors here confirmed that she had pneumonia and put her on life support.

Over the past few days, Ram Shankar says he’s watched bodies of children being taken away. “Yeh Mritak lok hai, dar lagta hai roj marte hue bachon ko dekh kar. Par aur kahan jayen. Lucknow dhaisau kilometre door hai (This is a place of the dead. I get afraid watching so many children die each day. But where can we go? Lucknow is over 250 km away),” he says.

Ankur, 14

Padawna, Kushinagar

Father Ram Swarup Singh works as a painter in Riyadh, earning Rs 20,000 a month

For five hours now, Ankur, shivering from high fever and bouts of seizures, has been lying wrapped in bedsheets. At 12.30 midnight, six hours after he arrived at BRD, he is finally shifted to the NICU.

Mother Reena says they knocked at the door of two hospitals before being referred to BRD. They have been asking the nursing staff for a blanket, but there is none to keep Ankur warm. They also hope a doctor would come soon to settle their fears. “Yeh Japani bukhaar hai kya? Private doctor keh raha tha ki sirf khoon kam hai. Phir aise kyun tadap raha hai (What is this Japanese Encephalitis? The private doctor had said it’s only anaemia. Then why is he is in such pain?)” Reena asks.

Inside the ward, every patient admitted is labelled to be suffering from the loosely used term ‘AES’. But very little or nothing is shared with the parents on the trigger behind the inflammatory brain disease. A doctor has told Ankur’s family “loss of blood supply” could be the reason for his disease.

Tests show Ankur’s haemoglobin levels are as low as 3g/dl, which is not a surprise, say doctors. An overwhelming number of patients at BRD are from low-income groups and have poor nutrition levels. Ankur had been first diagnosed as anaemic two years back too. Now he has again fallen ill, but this time with high fever and sudden seizures. “This has never happened,” says his uncle Ram Badan Singh, who works as a plumber in Mumbai.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has blamed dirty water and sanitation for the encephalitis cases. Ram Badan shrugs when asked if there is a toilet in their village Padawna. “No. All of use the fields,” he says.

Manjesh, 4

Pokharbhinda village, Darbhanga

Father Suraj works as a daily wage labourer, earning Rs 5,000 a month

Manjesh occupies the bed next to Ankur’s. His father says he can “understand the fears of Ankur’s family”.

The four-year-old from Pokharbhinda village in Darbhanga, 320 km away, was also diagnosed as being anaemic when admitted two days back, but is now being treated for AES.

While Manjesh is recovering, Suraj also gives the example of his elder son Anikesh, 6, who was wrongly diagnosed, three years back. Anikesh is now partly paralysed and cannot walk. “When he was 3, he had similar symptoms, fever followed by seizures. We rushed him to Metro Hospital in Gorakhpur. They admitted him for three days and then said he is fit to be discharged. Within a few days, he started becoming disoriented and confused and again the seizures followed. By that time, things were out of control,” Suraj says.

“Doctors tell you very little even as parents watch all of it happening before their eyes. I later came to know that my other son suffered from encephalitis. I understand the fear of the patients who come here for the first time,” Suraj says, offering help to Ram Swarup.

Akhilesh, 5

Chembur, Mumbai

Father Tulsi Prasad works with Hindustan Petroleum and earns Rs 20,000 a month

Akhilesh fell sick a week ago, when he mistakenly consumed a few drops of kerosene. “My father passed away last week, so we were visiting our village in Kushinagar for the rituals. By mistake, Akhilesh consumed kerosene lying in the kitchen. We took him to a local doctor and he said there is nothing to worry,” says Tulsi Prasad.

He hopes against hope that this is the cause for the five-year-old’s high fever and seizures. “We have no clue what is the reason. He was alright and suddenly now he has seizures,” the father says.

Inside, mother Rajkumari tries to sponge Akhilesh with one hand, while ensuring he doesn’t pull his ventilator tubes, with the other. She isn’t sure kerosene is responsible, she says. “These are just bad times for the family. My son is affected because of that. Why is he acting so disoriented? He has slept for only two hours.”

Pregnant, she also worries for her unborn child. “I’ve had to visit a doctor, I am not able to walk, it is just a bad time for us,” she adds.

Swajeet Kumar, 3 years

Bhatahat village, Gorakhpur

Father Chunmun Kumar, a ceramic tiles fitter, earns Rs 8,000-Rs 10,000 a month

Chunmun and wife Sarita have eaten little since doctors asked them to sign a paper indicating that the condition of their son Swajeet, ailing now for 20 days, was serious. Doctors also said he may need blood transfusion. Swajeet was admitted to Ward No. 100 on August 11, the day news of the other deaths broke. Chunmun, who witnessed the chaos due to oxygen shortage, says he was handed an ambu bag (manually inflated bag) for his son as he wasn’t breathing properly.

Chunmun, a father of four, and Sarita take turns to sleep during the day, when doctors and nurses are constantly available, but stay awake all night. Since Adityanath’s visit and the media coverage, things have “become better” at the hospital, Chunmun says. “I came here earlier with someone else but back then, we had to get medicines and tests done from outside. Not this time.”

Sitting on the floor just outside the PICU, Mohammad’s father Imran is holding his head. He has just been jolted out of sleep by a father carrying the body of his newly born child, with crying relatives in tow.

“We came here three days ago. Mohammad was running a high fever and having difficulty breathing. He began having fits too,” says Imran, adding that that a private hospital in Gorakhpur refused to admit his son. Imran says he didn’t bother visiting either the government hospital in the district or the closest primary health centre. “We were not sure if we would find anyone there. They don’t have paediatricians there either,” he says.

Imran’s father Shah Alam says doctors have told them Mohammad is suffering from serious congestion. Having watched children die on beds next to Mohammad’s, Imran says, “It is traumatic, but what do you do? As I said, for us there is no other place.”

With daughter Arohi’s temperature still high, the lone duty doctor wants her body to be sponged with water. “Jaldi chala (Come fast),” Pradeep tells his wife, directing her to PICU, where Arohi is admitted.

The couple and Pradeep’s parents, father Manager Prasad and mother, have been camping at the ward since August 16. Their village in Bihar’s Gopalganj is some 65 km from Gorakhpur. Manager says after his granddaughter developed fever, they first took her to a government and a private hospital in neighbouring Deoria district. “The private hospital wrongly diagnosed the child as having typhoid and began giving medicines. Her condition deteriorated,” says Manager, adding that it was only when they reached BRD that they realised Arohi’s condition had been wrongly diagnosed. Doctors have said she is stable now, but Arohi remains on life support.

Standing at the entrance of Ward No. 100, Govind Prasad, 52, says he has seen it all. The only guard on duty, Prasad, who hails from Maharajganj, retired from the Army. “My last posting was in Kargil,” he says proudly.

However, there is little he has seen more painful than the deaths at this ward, he sighs. “I have been working here for seven years under the NRHM (National Rural Health Mission). I was a strong man when I was in the Army. But children dying and in such numbers is very painful. There have been times when things have gone out of control,” says Prasad.

What happened this year was bad, he adds, but not the worst. “Two years back, the situation here was worse. At one point, there were no beds and children waited endlessly outside the ward. Some would die just because of the burden and delay.”

Ruthless Borussia Dortmund maul Wolves in Bundesliga start,"Borussia Dortmund defeated VfL Wolfsburg 3-0. (Source: AP) Borussia Dortmund defeated VfL Wolfsburg 3-0. (Source: AP)

Borussia Dortmund overcame hosts VfL Wolfsburg 3-0 on Saturday to make a flawless start to their Bundesliga season.

New Dortmund coach Peter Bosz had promised attractive, attacking football and his team, who finished third last season, delivered on his Bundesliga debut.

There was more good news for Dortmund with Mario Goetze making his comeback after half a year out following a metabolic disorder and the Germany international set up Christian Pulisic after 22 minutes for the first goal at the Volkswagen Arena. The absence of suspended Ousmane Dembele, who missed training last week amid speculation about a possible move to Barcelona, was quickly forgotten as Marc Bartra doubled the lead five minutes later against a dazed Wolfsburg defence.

With the Wolves cornered, Dortmund kept up the pressure and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, last season’s Bundesliga top scorer, added a third on the hour.

Champions Bayern Munich are also on three points after Friday’s 3-1 victory over Bayer Leverkusen. An 84th-minute deflected effort from Andrej Kramaric gave Hoffenheim, who face Liverpool next week for a spot in the Champions League group stage, a 1-0 win over Werder Bremen.

Australian Mathew Leckie struck twice for new club Hertha Berlin as they beat promoted VfB Stuttgart, back after a season in the second division, 2-0.

Nicolai Mueller’s goal gave Hamburg, who narrowly avoided a relegation playoff last season and suffered a shock German Cup first-round exit last week, a 1-0 win over Augsburg for their first victory at the start of the season in seven years.

Promoted Hanover 96 won by the same score with Austrian Martin Harnik on target against Mainz 05.

Last season’s runners-up RB Leipzig travel to Schalke 04 later on Saturday.

"I was yawning in final session of day-night Test because it was past my bedtime, says Alastair Cook","Alastair Cook scored a fine hundred against West Indies during day one of the first day-night Test match at Edgbaston. (Source: AP) Alastair Cook scored a fine hundred against West Indies during day one of the first day-night Test match at Edgbaston. (Source: AP)

On day one of the historic day-night Test at Edgbaston, Alastair Cook proved his mettle with the willow as he notched up a fine hundred. However, playing in his first day-night Test, Cook admitted that he is still getting accustomed to the style of play.

In a report by cricket.au.com, Cook said, “I was yawning at 9 pm because it was past my bedtime,” he said after the finish at 9.30pm UK time. It was slightly unusual because you’re programmed to play in white kit starting at 11am with a red ball. It’s what we’ve done for all our careers. Suddenly changing it takes a little bit of time. It’s just a mental thing.”

“I’ve got the opportunity to get a big score with 153 not out on day one,” he said and added, “There’s obviously a lot of time left in game but you can always nick the first one tomorrow. But I’ve got an opportunity. It’s up to me to take it.”

I don’t know why hundreds are such a big thing. I was really pleased with the couple of 50s in a tough series against South Africa where the ball did quite a lot. But as a batter, you’re always judged on hundreds and big ones. It’s nice today that when it tilted in the batters’ favour, I managed to cash in.”

Meanwhile, Cook also praised skipper Joe root and said that seeing him bat is always a joy. “He makes it look quite easy – frustratingly easy. It’s incredible he manages to score like he does. If he’s not the best England player I’ve played with he’s right up there – I think he is. His game is phenomenal and he’s just churning out runs. He’s just phenomenally consistent against world-class bowlers around the world. Genius. Unbelievable player.”, Cook said.

India-Australia ODI tickets at Kolkata to cost more after GST,"The Eden Gardens will host one of the ODIs of the five- match India-Australia series, tentatively on September 21. (Source: Express Archive) The Eden Gardens will host one of the ODIs of the five- match India-Australia series, tentatively on September 21. (Source: Express Archive)

The prices of the tickets of the One-day match between India and Australia, to be held here next month, will be costlier as 28 per cent GST has been imposed as per government regulation.

The minimum price of the ticket was today increased from Rs. 500 to Rs. 650 after applying 28 per cent GST. Likewise, other tickets would cost Rs. 1300 and Rs. 1900, up from Rs 1000 and Rs. 1500 respectively.

“Ticket prices have remained the same, just the GST has been added,” Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB’s) president Sourav Ganguly said after its working committee meeting today.

The Eden Gardens will host one of the ODIs of the five- match India-Australia series, tentatively on September 21.

Kolkata will host a Test during Sri Lanka’s tour to India in November. However, GST will not have any effect on the ticket prices of the five-day game.

“Test tickets are sold on a daily basis. It’s Rs. 100 tickets, so there’s no GST,” said Ganguly.

Meanwhile, the former India skipper said it would be tough for Australia to beat India at home, especially with their ace paceman Mitchell Starc being rested as he continues his recovery from a foot injury.

“It would not be easy to beat India,” said Ganguly.

Finger length may predict athletic ability: Study,"Researchers explored the difference in length between one’s index finger and ring finger, and a possible link to muscular strength. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Researchers explored the difference in length between one’s index finger and ring finger, and a possible link to muscular strength. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Your hands may predict how good you are at sports, say scientists who found that athletic prowess could be related to the length of your fingers. Researchers explored the difference in length between one’s index finger and ring finger, and a possible link to muscular strength. They found that the ratio of the length of the index finger and the length of the ring finger – called the “digit

ratio” – is favourably related to muscular strength in boys.

The ring finger in males is typically longer than the index finger, whereas the fingers are about the same length in females, said Grant Tomkinson, a professor at the University of North Dakota in the US.

“There is some indirect evidence that this digit ratio of the length of the fingers, is determined during early foetal development by testosterone – the more testosterone the foetus produces, the longer the ring finger, so the smaller the digit ratio,” he said.

Testosterone is the natural steroid hormone that enhances sport, athletic and fitness test performance. In general, people with smaller digit ratios are better athletes, researchers said. “Our study shows that boys with lower digit ratios have better handgrip strength, irrespective of their age or body size,” Tomkinson said.

Since muscular strength is important for success in many youth sports and athletic events, the finding suggests that the digit ratio may predict performance in youth sports and athletic events requiring high strength, researchers said. Muscular strength is also an important indicator of good health, and those with lower digit ratios probably have better general health and well-being, Tomkinson said.

Researchers also found that females with lower digit ratios are better basketball players. The study was published in the journal Early Human Development.

US designates two top ISIS leaders as ‘global terrorists’,"Representational image. Representational image.

The US today designated two top Islamic State leaders, one of whom involved in the deadly 2015 Paris and 2016 Brussels attacks, as ‘global terrorists’ as they pose a significant risk to America. Ahmad Alkhald, a Syrian national, is an ISIS bomb-maker responsible for the deaths of numerous civilians in Europe. Abu Yahya al-Iraqi, also known as Iyad Hamed Mahl al-Jumaily, is a senior ISIS figure who reports to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

These designations seek to deny Alkhald and Al-Iraqi the resources they need to plan and carry out further terrorist attacks, the State Department said. Among other consequences, all of Alkhald’s and Al-Iraqi’s property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and Americans are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with them.

The State Department said Alkhald is the explosives chief of the terrorist cell that carried out the November 2015 attacks in Paris and the March 2016 attacks in Brussels. Alkhald travelled to Europe where he helped plan the Paris attacks and manufacture the explosive belts used in that plot, which killed and injured hundreds of people, including a number of Americans.

Following his return to Syria shortly before the attacks in Paris, Alkhald continued to guide ISIS operatives in Europe on making the bombs used in the March 2016 Brussels attacks. Alkhald is wanted internationally and a European warrant for his arrest has been issued.

On the other hand, Al-Iraqi has reportedly played a key role in security for Al-Baghdadi and oversees ISIS security in Iraq and Syria, the State Department said. The US has so far designated over 30 ISIS leaders and operatives.

“These designations are part of a larger comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS that, in coordination with the 73-member Global Coalition, has made significant progress towards that goal.

“This whole-of-government effort is destroying ISIS in its safe havens, denying its ability to recruit foreign terrorist fighters, stifling its financial resources, negating the false propaganda it disseminates over the internet and social media and helping to stabilise liberated areas in Iraq and Syria so the displaced can return to their homes and begin to rebuild their lives,” said the State Department.

Barcelona terror attack: Spanish plan for carnage started with botched explosion,"A woman cries in front of a memorial tribute to the victims of the terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain, Saturday Aug. 19, 2017.

A cell of at least nine extremists meticulously plotted to combine vehicles and explosives in a direct hit on tourists, and managed to carry off most of their deadly plan, killing 14 people, authorities said Friday. Police in Spain and France pressed a manhunt for any remaining members of the group, which Islamic State claimed as its own.

Only flawed bomb construction avoided a more devastating attack, authorities said after taking a closer look at a blast Wednesday evening in the town of Alcanar that was first written off as a household gas explosion. At least one person was killed and several injured in the home where police said the deadly plan took shape.

Eighteen hours later, a rented van veered into Barcelona’s crowded Las Ramblas promenade, swerving along the walkway Thursday and killing 13 people. A surveillance video from inside a museum, which captured images of the van, showed it speeding down the promenade, barely missing a person with a stroller while others scattered.

Armed with an ax, knives and false explosives belts, attackers then drove a second vehicle to the boardwalk in the resort town of Cambrils early Friday, fatally injuring one person. Five of those attackers were shot to death, among them 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, according to a Spanish police union official, confirming Spanish news reports.

Oukabir’s name was first on a document listing four suspects sought in the attacks, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation. The Barcelona-based La Vanguardia newspaper, Spanish national broadcaster RTVE and other outlets cited police sources as saying he was the driver of the van in Barcelona.

The arrest order was issued throughout Spain and into France, according to the Spanish official and a French police official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the document. They did not say what became of the other three men listed, who ranged in age from 18 to 24. All had roots in Morocco; only Moussa Oukabir was born in Spain, according to the document.

Earlier in the day, Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont said at least one “terrorist is still on out there. We do not have information regarding the capacity to do more harm.”

The French official said Spain had flagged a rented van that was believed to have crossed the border to the north.

Moussa’s brother Driss Oukabir was arrested Thursday after he went to police to report his stolen identity documents were those found in the van abandoned on the historic Las Ramblas promenade, Spanish media reported.

The brothers were born and raised in Ripoll, a quiet, upscale town of 10,000 tucked into hilly Catalan heartland and dominated by the imposing tower of the Monesteri de Santa Maria. The dented door to the family’s first-floor apartment swung open Friday; the home was empty.

Neighbors said they were shocked by the news of Moussa Oukabir’s involvement. One teenager, who identified himself only by his first name, Pau, said they played together when they were younger and he was “a good boy.”

Authorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting for a long time from the house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (124 miles) down the coast from Barcelona. The house was destroyed by a butane gas explosion Wednesday night that killed one person. One of those injured in the blast was taken into custody.

Senior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said police believed the apparently accidental explosion prevented the suspects from carrying out a far deadlier attack.

Police said they arrested two people Friday, after the two arrests a day earlier. In custody are three Moroccans and one Spaniard, none with terrorism-related records.

“We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,” regional Interior Ministry chief Joaquim Forn told Onda Cero radio.

The sheer size of the cell recalled the November 2015 attacks in Paris, in which trained Islamic State attackers struck the national stadium, a concert hall and bars and restaurants nearly simultaneously. Since then, the extremist group has steadily lost ground in its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, most recently with its defeat in Mosul.

“This shows there is no correlation between what is happening over there with Daesh and the operational capacity of the group,” said Jean-Charles Brisard, a French security analyst, using another name for the group.

Spanish authorities had not yet drawn any direct links between IS extremists and the suspects in the Spanish attacks, but the possibility that members of the Spanish group could still be at large was chilling. Those who have survived prior attacks nearly always ended their lives with new bloodshed and a hail of police bullets.

“There is the danger they will not let themselves get caught and will do something dramatic,” said Alain Chouet, a former French intelligence official.

Amid heavy security, Barcelona tried to move forward Friday, with the Las Ramblas promenade quietly reopening to the public and King Felipe VI and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy joining thousands in a minute of silence in the city’s main square.

“I am not afraid! I am not afraid!” the crowd chanted in Catalan and Spanish.

But the attacks unnerved a country that hasn’t seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 191 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid’s commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted about 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.

Authorities were still dealing with the Barcelona van attack when police in Cambrils, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the south, fatally shot the five attackers who had plowed into tourists and locals with their car near the town’s boardwalk. Forn said the five were wearing fake bomb belts.

One woman in Cambrils died from her injuries and five others were wounded, Catalan police said.

Cambrils Mayor Cami Mendoza said the town had taken precautions after the Barcelona bloodshed, but the suspects focused their attack on the narrow path to the boardwalk, which is usually packed.

“We were on a terrace,” said bystander Jose Antonio Saez. “We heard the crash and intense gunshots, then (saw) the dead bodies on the floor, shot by the police.”

Others described scenes of panic and found safety inside bars and restaurants until police secured the area.

“It was clearly a terror attack, intended to kill as many people as possible,” Trapero said.

The Islamic State group said on its Aamaq news agency that the Barcelona attack was carried out by “soldiers of the Islamic State” in response to its calls for followers to target countries participating in the coalition fighting the extremist group in Syria and Iraq.

Islamic extremists have targeted Europe’s major tourist attractions in recent years. Rented or hijacked vehicles have formed the backbone of a strategy to attack the West and its cultural symbols. Barcelona’s Las Ramblas is one of the most popular attractions in a city that swarms with foreign tourists in August.

The dead and wounded in the two attacks came from 34 countries.

Rajoy called the killings a “savage terrorist attack” and said Spaniards “are not just united in mourning, but especially in the firm determination to beat those who want to rob us of our values and our way of life.”

President Donald Trump personally offered his condolences to Rajoy and pledged to support Spanish authorities in their investigation and in bringing the perpetrators to justice, the White House said Friday.

Makeshift memorials grew along Las Ramblas after it reopened to the public.

“It’s sad,” New York tourist John Lanza said, as the family stood outside the gated La Boqueria market. “You can tell it’s obviously quieter than it usually is, but I think people are trying to get on with their lives.”

"First-come, first-served policy for online admissions to FYJC","There was chaos at the office of the deputy Director of Education on Friday. Express There was chaos at the office of the deputy Director of Education on Friday. Express

For the first time since the online Centralised Admission Process (CAP) process has begun, students can now avail of the “first-come, first served” policy for admissions to the first year junior college (FYJC) seats.

At least 1,059 students have not got a single allotment in any college despite five rounds of admissions, including a special round which is currently ongoing. A higher number consists of those students who have got allotments, but have not confirmed their seats as they are unhappy with those allotted to them, which is what has prompted CAP officials to come up with this unique admission process.

On Friday, the state government gave its approval for the “first-come, first-served” online admission process which would be rolled out after August 21, confirmed Meenakshi Raut, assistant director of education, Pune.

“In this process, a student who has not yet taken admission elsewhere will be able to log into the online admission website, using their existing Login ID and password. They will get an option to select their stream and once they have done so, a list of the colleges, along with their college codes, medium of instruction and all will be available. Once a student clicks on the college name, they will get the vacancy. If there is a vacant seat and the student wishes to take admission there, then they would get an option saying ‘Apply Now’. Once the student clicks on it, they will get the option to reserve that seat at that very minute. So, in the true sense, it would be a first-come, first-served basis of admissions since whichever student selects it first will get the admission,” said Raut.

Asked what would happen if a student with lesser percentage gets a seat into a college which a student with higher percentage was hoping to get, she said that it cannot be helped in all cases, but three groups of students would be prepared based on obtained marks and cut-off percentages.

“We are yet to work out these details, but we will have the admissions in phase-wise manner. On Day 1, we would keep the online admission portal open for students with above 80 per cent marks while on Day Two, students with 60 per cent and above can select seats and on the third day, all other students can take admissions. In their own group, if a student with lesser percentage takes the same seat which a student with higher percentage wanted, then it cannot be helped as this is first come, first-served round,” she added.

Raut said that though this is the first year when such a round was being carried out, if it turns out to be a success, then it would be implemented in future as well. On August 19, CAP officials would officially declare the details of the special round of admissions, along with the details of the process to be followed.

Meanwhile, on Friday, a huge crowd of students assembled at the Deputy Director of Education, Pune office, demanding to know the status of their admissions. Most of the students assembled were those who had not got admission into any college despite five rounds. The students were assured by the CAP officials of getting a seat in the next special round of admissions.

CAP committee issues notice to Mt Carmel college

After receiving complaints from students and their parents that they have been refused admissions allotted through the CAP process at Lulla Nagar’s Mount Carmel College, the junior college authorities have been issued a notice by the Deputy Director of Education office. Taking serious view of the complaints, the college has been reminded that it is mandatory to give the admissions allotted through CAP process and the college has been given a period of one day — until August 19 — to give admissions to the students allotted through CAP who come to confirm their seats. The notice, issued on August 18, warns college authorities that if students are denied admissions, the college could face de-recognition process.

Facebook group helps rescue woman stuck in swimming pool in US,"Leslie Kahn logged onto Facebook and posted an SOS message on the Epping Squawks” group page. Her virtual community responded within minutes. (Source: Screenshot/nydaily.com) Leslie Kahn logged onto Facebook and posted an SOS message on the Epping Squawks” group page. Her virtual community responded within minutes. (Source: Screenshot/nydaily.com)

A 61-year-old woman stuck in a swimming pool was rescued by members of a Facebook community after she posted a help message on the social media network, according to a media report. Leslie Kahn, from the US state of New Hampshire, was stuck in the pool last Friday. She was at the end of a swim in her backyard pool when the step ladder she used broke, the New York Daily reported.

“She had no other way to hoist herself up and out of the water,” she said. Without neighbours within earshot or her cell phone, she could not call for help. Kahn struggled for nearly three hours before she used her swimming pool pole and technology to get help.

She reached for the pole and used it to drag a chair, where her iPad sat, to where she could reach it. She logged onto Facebook and posted an SOS message on the “Epping Squawks” group page. “I started off with 911 and an exclamation point,” Kahn said. “I wanted to get people’s attention fast.”

Her virtual community responded within minutes.

One of Kahn’s neighbours who had read the post soon showed up in person. “I was really glad to see her friendly face, and I sent her inside for the toolbox,” Kahn said. Kahn quickly updated her town’s Facebook page to let its 3,981 members know help had arrived.

Kahn, a breast cancer survivor, says her community’s reaction was encouraging. “You get through whatever life throws at you, and you ask for help,” she said.

Barcelona terror attack: Players to wear shirts with ‘Barcelona’ on back in first league game,"The club sought permission from La Liga for the change in the shirt after the terror attack in Barcelona. The club sought permission from La Liga for the change in the shirt after the terror attack in Barcelona.

After Spain’s biggest terror attack in ten years, Barcelona FC players will wear shirts with ‘Barcelona’ written on their backs instead of their names in the first league game of the season against Real Betis to pay homage to the victims of the attack.

The club has sought permission from La Liga and the RFEF for the change, which will also have #TotsSomBarcelona written on the chest of the shirt. The players of the team across all divisions will support a black armband in all the games taking place this weekend to condemn the attack which killed 14 people and injured around 100.

The club’s website said, “A minute’s silence before kick-off to commemorate all the victims and offer support to their friends and relatives, and all the citizens and visitors to the city.”

On Friday, a day after the attack, all La Liga teams across Spain observed a minute’s silence during their training. Among the football stars to offer support and condolences after the attack were Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos.

Messi wrote, “I want to send my condolences and all my support to the families and friends of the victims of the terrible attack in our beloved Barcelona, in addition to totally rejecting any act of violence. We are not going to give up, there are many more of us who want to live in a world in peace, without hate and where respect and tolerance are the basis of coexistence.”

Fifth Column: Hugs for Kashmir,"Indian soldiers holding the Tricolor while showcasing valour near Line of Actual Control at Chushul , 59 kilometers from Pangong lake in Leh. Photo Express Shuaib Masoodi(arranged) Indian soldiers holding the Tricolor while showcasing valour near Line of Actual Control at Chushul , 59 kilometers from Pangong lake in Leh.

The Prime Minister used the most important speech he makes annually to announce a reversal of his Kashmir strategy last week. At the end of a year of jihadist terrorism and violence perpetrated by stone-pelting mobs, Narendra Modi tells us that the way forward is to embrace our Kashmiri brothers and not inflict upon them more bullets and abuse. This is a sweet, compassionate idea but who is it we should be hugging? Stone-pelting children? Masked jihadists? Women veiled to the teeth in black Wahabbi fashion? Or those old frauds who comprise the Hurriyat Conference, whose financial links with Pakistan stand revealed? As someone who has covered political change and secessionism in the Valley since our current Kashmir problem began in the early Eighties, I found the Prime Minister’s statement worrying. It indicates an absence of policy and a misunderstanding of history.

Farooq Abdullah said last week that neither Pakistan nor China could be blamed for what has gone wrong in Kashmir and this caused mass hysteria on our shrill ‘patriotic’ TV channels. So nobody noticed that he was right. Our present Kashmir problem has nothing to do with the historical Kashmir problem that ended when Sheikh Abdullah signed his peace pact with Indira Gandhi in 1975. By then, the average Kashmiri was in any case disenchanted with Pakistan because of what happened in Bangladesh. And, when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged four years later, the disenchantment deepened.

Our current Kashmir problem was created by two mistakes made by Indira Gandhi and Rajiv. Mrs Gandhi made the mistake of wrongly toppling Farooq’s government in 1984 and replacing him with a cipher. This revived memories of old betrayals. Rajiv made a bad situation worse by forcing an alliance between the Congress and the National Conference before the next election. By 1989, when Yasin Malik kidnapped Mehbooba Mufti’s sister, an armed insurgency had begun. It took Pakistan by surprise and it was only later that the insurgents began to receive ‘moral support’ from our friendly neighbourhood Islamic Republic.

These facts appear to have been forgotten not just by TV anchors who routinely invite Pakistani military men to their shows and hurl abuse at them. More worrying is that they seem to have been forgotten by those who are making Kashmir policy on Raisina Hill. Worse still, there seems to be nobody on the exalted heights of that Hill who has noticed that the nature of the secessionist movement has changed. As Burhan Wani and his comrades have pointed out more than once, the fight is now a jihad in the name of Allah. Islam, in their view, considers nationalism contained within the borders of nation-states an abomination. So the men who killed innocent tourists in Spain last week are brothers-in-jihad with those who kill our soldiers and paramilitaries in Kashmir.

The only way to deal with them is to do what Pervez Musharraf said he would do again to end secessionism in Baluchistan. I crushed them last time, he bragged last week in his fake Punjabi Urdu accent, and I will do it once more if I get the chance. Of all the Pakistani leaders I have met over the years, I find him the most despicable because he exudes rabid hatred of India, but he came closer to finding a permanent solution in Kashmir than anyone else. He and Dr Manmohan Singh had agreed that everyone needed to give up the rigidity of their positions if a solution were to be found. Before he could do anything about this though, he landed himself in serious domestic trouble and had to relinquish power.

Now because successive governments in Delhi have been unable to rectify the mistakes made in the Eighties, and because the violence in the Valley has taken an ugly jihadist turn, new solutions will need to be found. There is little international support for radical Islam so the Kashmiris are unlikely to arouse worldwide sympathy for their jihad, but Pakistan and possibly China will continue to meddle in our troubled Valley. What does our Prime Minister plan to do to stop them? What are his plans to restore peace in the Valley? Who exactly does he suggest we embrace? Is there a strategy to boost tourism and investment in untroubled parts of the state like Ladakh and Jammu? If not, then why not?

None of these questions can be addressed without a clear Kashmir policy that does not veer wildly from the jackboot to hugs. So it really is time that we heard what the Modi government’s Kashmir policy is. May I suggest that a good beginning would be to try and convince ordinary Kashmiri supporters and stone-pelters that they can have as many hugs as they need and as much balm for their wounds as long as they remember that India will not be broken once more.

After defeating West Indies in the first day-night Test, England skipper Joe Root has revealed that he is extremely privileged to lead three of England’s most successful Test cricketers – Alastair Cook, James Anderson and Stuart Broad.

“We all know the class and skill these guys have, and we’re so fortunate to have those guys rolled into one era,” said Root and added, “All three of the senior guys, the record-breakers, set the standard.”

Lauding the players for their performances, he said, “To have the two leading (England) wicket-takers and the leading (England) run-scorer in the side, you have to be careful not to take that for granted. I’m extremely privileged to play in the same team as them — and what a place for young guys to learn, with that great experience and so many runs and wickets behind them.”

Meanwhile, after surpassing Ian Botham’s tally of records, Stuart Broad expressed happiness and said that he felt special after accomplishing the feat.

“He’s obviously been a hero of mine, someone who gave me my Test cap back in 2007 and someone who inspired me to play cricket for England,” he said and added, “It’s very special to be up there in the ranks with him. It was a fantastic team effort. We spoke about carrying on the hard work from the last series — I thought we did that exceptionally well.”

“It’s important we don’t get ahead of ourselves, but it (this win) has filled us with confidence,” added Root.

Former European champion Velichko Cholakov dies at 35,"Bulgaria’s former European weightlifting champion Velichko Cholakov, who served a four-year ban for doping, died on Sunday at the age of 35. A hospital official in the southern town of Smolyan confirmed Cholakov’s death and said the cause would only be known after an autopsy.

Members of Cholakov’s family told local media he had recently been suffering with heart problems. A number of Bulgarian weightlifters have died at young ages.

Bulgaria’s 2004 Olympic weightlifting champion Milen Dobrev died two years ago at the age of 35, while three-times weightlifting world champion Mihail Petrov passed away at the age of 28 in 1992.

Cholakov was among the 11 members of the Bulgarian team that failed doping tests before the start of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. That led to the withdrawal of the whole team from the Games.

At 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 metres), Cholakov, who also won the silver medal in the over 105 kg-category at the world championships in 2003 and Olympic bronze in Athens a year later, was one of the tallest lifters of all time.

After serving a four-year doping ban, he obtained Azerbaijani citizenship and was set to compete for the oil-rich country at the 2012 Olympics in London but withdrew before the competition due to health issues.

Bulgarian weightlifters have won 12 Olympic titles and 36 medals in total, making it one of the most successful Olympic sports in the country.

Tough for plus-size people to find work in the glamour industry: Anjali Anand,"It is tough for people to accept a big girl on the poster,” says Anjali Anand, who is known for her TV show “Dhhai Kilo Prem”. It is tough for people to accept a big girl on the poster,” says Anjali Anand, who is known for her TV show “Dhhai Kilo Prem”.

Actor-model Anjali Anand said plus-size people are still not accepted by the entertainment and glamour industry. Anjali, who walked the ramp for the all Primero collection by Wendell Rodricks at the Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017, said initially in her career, she faced a lot of difficulty to find work. “It is a sad thing that we don’t have plus size models in India. Plus size people don’t get work in modelling or acting as much as normal people do. Finding work in glamour industry is tough.

“When I started modelling as a plus size, I always thought I will not get the job in this country. People saw me on the posters and were shocked. It is tough for people to accept a big girl on the poster. I feel we should be happy about what we are. We have to be comfortable in whatever we are wearing,” she said. The actor, however, is happy that the mindset is slowly changing and things have become better for her post her TV show “Dhhai Kilo Prem.”

“People’s view is changing. I did modelling and then did a show and now people have started looking at me differently. It motivates me.”

Rodricks’ collection was a rule breaker starting with the colours – white, which has been taboo for too long where plus sizes are concerned. Then it was neutrals, grey and clothes with great volume. The designer said he has always designed for voluptuous women as he believes it is unfair to ignore a major section of the society just because they don’t fit in the “perfect body” bracket.

“We have plus size concept all over the world but nothing was there for Indian women. We wanted to create something for Indian women. Plus size women feel they are completely out of the purview of the fashion. 60 per cent of the population falls in this category, so we tried to break the myth. “For me that was a personal accomplishment of sorts. This was the real show for me, this was the best show for me.”

Varonica Campabell, India’s first transgender plus size model walked for the show along with 20 other plus size models, who were selected through an audition held in June. While the women’s wear was a kaleidoscope of colours and included layered tunics, asymmetric gowns, winging dresses, capes and kaftans, the menswear featured deconstructed plackets, mull bundies, tunics, and twill cotton.

The lycra shirts with contrast stitch details, poly knits, silver speck foil prints, crush pleated poly georgette and pewter shine stripes completed the extensive fabrics and detailing choices.

Simona Halep in line for number one after Cincinnati Open semifinal win,"Simona Halep of Romania Halep needed just 54 minutes to cruise past Sloane Stephens. (Source: USA Today) Simona Halep of Romania Halep needed just 54 minutes to cruise past Sloane Stephens. (Source: USA Today)

The second-ranked Halep needed just 54 minutes to cruise past Sloane Stephens 6-2, 6-1 on Saturday in the Western & Southern Open semifinals, and can displace Karolina Pliskova as the top of the ranking with a victory over Garbine Muguruza on Sunday.

The fourth-ranked Muguruza reached her first W&S final with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over defending champion Pliskova.

The men’s final will feature two first-timers. Grigor Dimitrov outlasted John Isner 7-6 (4), 7-6 (10) in the first men’s semifinal. Nick Kyrgios beat David Ferrer 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4).

Halep, seeking her first No. 1 ranking, has yet to drop a set in the tournament and appears to be peaking at just the right time.

“I think I played my best match on hardcourt so far,” said Halep, who can become the first Romanian woman to be ranked No. 1. “It felt great. I moved very well today. From the first point, I felt like I was going to play good tennis.”

The final Sunday will be the first on American soil for Muguruza, who lost to Pliskova in last year’s W&S semifinals after losing to Serena Williams in the 2015 finals. The Spaniard had lost six straight matches against Pliskova since winning their first in 2013.

“I was very precise with my shots,” said Muguruza, who is 2-1 in her career against Halep, though the two haven’t played since 2015. “I wanted to be more aggressive and take my shots. I felt pretty good out there _ under control. Everything went my way.”

Muguruza won when Pliskova sailed a forehand long on the fifth match point. Pliskova, who played part of one match and all of another Friday after rain forced postponements Thursday, had 28 unforced errors to Muguruza’s 13.

Muguruza was coming off playing the tournament’s longest match, a 2-hour, 45-minute three-set win over Svetlana Kuznetsova on Friday. That followed a 2-hour, 18-minute win over Madison Keys on Thursday, when she fought off three match points.

“I don’t think I played my best tennis today,” Pliskova said. “I think the energy was pretty low from my side. Obviously, a tough schedule for me the last two days – three matches in about not even 24 hours.

“I think she played very solid, not missing much and obviously serving well. Everything started, I think, in the first game of the first set.”

Muguruza took charge early, breaking Pliskova in the first and last games of the first set.

She gained a second-set edge with a backhand winner on break point for a 4-2 lead before closing it out in 1 hour, 19 minutes.

Stephens, playing her fourth tournament since returning from January foot surgery, also was playing a third match in a span of 24 hours.

“That’s never easy,” she said. “I’m going to go with that. I didn’t play that badly. She was a little fresher. It was just not a great day.”

The 11th-ranked Dimitrov, who lost in the last year’s semifinal to eventual champion Marin Cilic, had just one double fault and finished with nine unforced errors to No. 19 Isner’s 28 in the 2-hour, 3-minute match. The Bulgarian will play the winner of the semifinal between Nick Kyrgios, who knocked out second-ranked Rafael Nadal in straight sets in a Friday quarterfinal, and David Ferrer.

“Today was, I think, one of those matches that I really had to just be patient,” Dimitrov said. “I think that that was the key. I knew I’m not going to have that many rallies against John. I knew that he’s going to serve big, bold serves. I just had to be very composed and use every opportunity that I had. I think in the end of the match, it was just a few points that made the biggest difference for me. I’m just happy obviously with the win, but I’m just happy with the way I kept myself together throughout the whole match. Just remained calm in those tough moments. I mean, I know it’s nerve-wracking from outside, but it’s even tougher when you’re in there and have to receive a serve that comes 141 mph.”

Dimitrov’s composure was the key, according to Isner.

“The difference was he was a lot more decisive at the big moments,” Isner said. “He was a little calmer as well _ a little more free-flowing in big moments. I thought he played a high-level match. He certainly is in good form. I played well enough to beat a lot of players today _ just not him.”

The 23rd-ranked Kyrgios will be playing in his first ATP Masters 1000 final _ the highest-level final of his career.

“Obviously, I’m excited, but it’s just another tennis match to me,” the Australian said. “I’ll just go out and serve and whatever happens, happens. It’ll be a tough match.”

Kyrgios and Ferrer displayed remarkably efficient serving in their nightcap. They combined for six break points, converting none.

“He served really good,” the 31st-ranked Ferrer said. “I didn’t have chance in the second tiebreak. In important moments with the second serve, he played aggressive.”

"India vs Sri Lanka, 1st ODI: Spinners put India in driver’s seat","Axar Patel returned with figures of 3/34 in 10 overs. (Source: Reuters) Axar Patel returned with figures of 3/34 in 10 overs. (Source: Reuters)

The Virat Kohli-led Indian team continued with their form in Sri Lanka after the bowlers restricted home side for a total of 216 in 43.2 overs. India rode on spinners to push Sri Lanka on backfoot after Yuzvendra Chahal, Axar Patel and Kedar Jadhav shared seven wickets out of the 10. Patel returned with figures of 3/34 in 10 overs.

Earlier, after winning the toss, Kohli opted to bowl first. Sri Lankan openers Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka began the proceedings well for their side as the two compiled an opening stand of 74 runs. Gunathilaka was the first batsman to go back to the pavillion after Chahal scalped him for 35.

But the first breakthrough didn’t really effect the scoring rate for Upul Tharanga’s side as Dickwella along with Kusal Mendis notched up a partnership of 65 runs for second wicket. Wicket-keeper batsman Dickwella was the second one to be sent back, and triggered a steady slide for the hosts.

The hosts failed to capitalise on the start they got in Dambulla and lost the plot in middle overs after the spin was introduced from both the ends. They lost wickets regularly and were reeling at 187/8.

Former captain Angelo Mathews though showed some resistance against Indian bowling attack but ran out of batting partners at the other end. Mathews remained unbeaten at 36.

While the spinners did the job for visitors in the middle overs, fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah wrapped up Sri Lankan innings after cleaning up debutant Vishwa Fernando for a duck.

Utkal Express derailment: Four railway officials suspended as death toll rises to 22,"Utkal Express derailment: At least 22 passengers were dead and over 150 injured when 14coaches of the Puri-Haridwar Kalinga Utkal Express derailed in Muzaffarnagar.

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna)

Four railway officials were on Sunday suspended, including senior divisional engineer, in the aftermath of the Utkal Express derailment at Khatauli, 25 km from Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh. The latest development comes a day after the tragic mishap left at least 22 passengers dead and over 150 injured when 14 coaches of the Puri-Haridwar Kalinga Utkal Express derailed in one of the deadliest train mishaps in the recent times.

Besides, the Railway Board has also sent three officials on leave, including Northern Railway General Manager RK Kulshreshtra, Railway Board Member Engineering Aditya Mittal and Divisional Railway Manager Delhi RN Singh and transferred Chief Track Engineer of Northern Railway.

Earlier in the day, railway officials had indicated that negligence at the local level appeared to have caused the derailment of Utkal Express. Reflecting on the incident, Mohd Jamshed, Member Traffic, Railway Board, said an initial probe has found that maintenance work was being carried out on the tracks which might have caused the derailment. “Prime facie, it seems maintenance work was being carried out on the tracks…. Some maintenance work was going on, which might have caused the derailment of Utkal Express,” Jamshed said, adding a probe would reveal if any maintenance work was being carried out on the tracks without permission.

“Prima facie, the information is that there is divisional responsibility involved if work was being done without seeking permission. By this evening we will know if any of our staff was responsible for this,” he said.

Although the exact cause of the derailment is yet to be ascertained, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has directed Railway Board Chairman to fix responsibility on “prima facie evidence by the end of day”. On Sunday, Minister Suresh Prabhu has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 3.5 lakh to the families of those deceased and Rs 50,000 to the grievously injured and Rs 25,000 to those with minor injuries.

High-tech cranes and scores of workers have been deployed by the railways to clear the tracks near Khatauli. Rescue operations by the National Disaster Response Force had finished at around 3 AM.

Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh police said an FIR has been lodged against unknown persons in the derailment of Kalinga Utkal Express. “On August 19, 2017, at around 5.45 pm (1745), 18477 Kalinga Utkal Express, which was going from Puri to Haridwar, derailed near Khatauli railway station, and was damaged. In this regard, sub-inspector Ajay Kumar Singh, who is also the police post in-charge of GRP Khatauli has lodged an FIR at 11.30 pm (2330),” a UP police spokesperson said in a press release.

“The FIR was lodged under sections 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 304a (causing death by negligence) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 151 (damage to or destruction of certain railway properties) and 153 (endangering safety of persons travelling by railway by wilful act or omission) of Railway Act against unknown persons,” he said.

Diego Costa determined to rejoin Atletico Madrid,"“My destination is already set,” Diego Costa was quoted as saying by Brazilian newspaper O Globo. (Source: Reuters) “My destination is already set,” Diego Costa was quoted as saying by Brazilian newspaper O Globo. (Source: Reuters)

Chelsea striker Diego Costa is determined to rejoin former side Atletico Madrid despite the La Liga club subject to a transfer ban preventing them from registering players until January.

Costa has not played for Chelsea since the FA Cup final in May, following which he claims manager Antonio Conte sent him a text telling him he was not in his plans for the new season.

The Brazilian-born Spain international, who joined Chelsea from Atletico in 2014, has accused the Premier League club of treating him like a “criminal” and has said he was willing to see out the remaining two years of his deal unpaid in Brazil.

“My destination is already set,” Costa was quoted as saying by Brazilian newspaper O Globo. “I must return to Atletico Madrid next season.”

The situation is complicated by the fact that Atletico are currently banned from signing players in this window although a loan deal would be possible. The club have been handed a two-window FIFA transfer ban for signing minors.

“It turns out that there is the impasse that Chelsea does not want to release me,” added Costa. “But I believe this situation will be resolved now on my return to Spain.”

"We worked hard like male cricketers but people were unaware, says Sushma Verma","Sushma Verma and India fell nine runs short to England in the ICC Women’s World Cup. (Source: AP) Sushma Verma and India fell nine runs short to England in the ICC Women’s World Cup. (Source: AP)

Even though the India women’s cricket team lost their World Cup final to England, they were lauded, appreciated and felicitated for their tremendous achievement and efforts. For the first time, even though India had reached final of World Cup in the past, did Indian women team get the same level of respect and garnered same amount of attention from fans and media. Sushma Verma, the team’s wicketkeeper, said the response once they returned was a first.

“After we lost the final, the team was very disappointed but we saw later that the fans were even more disappointed. But at the same time, after we returned, we noticed a lot of new things for the first time ever – the fans came to receive us, we were felicitated so many times, people were showering so much love on us – it was all very new. Till now, the kind of love and support men’s cricket had received in India, women’s cricket had not. We saw that changing after this World Cup. We wanted to bring about a change in the mindset of the fans regarding women’s cricket through our performances and that is why it feels great to see that,” she told Times of India at an event in the capital.

“We were desperately waiting for this because we are also working hard like the male cricketers or other sportspersons. The difference was that people were unaware of those efforts. It’s good that people are also watching us and giving the same importance to us that they give to male cricketers,” she said as someone who gets stopped by fans to click selfies and is surrounded by people seeking her autograph.

Labelled the ‘female Dhoni’ for her prowess behind the stumps, Sushma laughs it off and says she’s only trying to be herself and not emulate a World Cup winner such as Dhoni. “It is humbling that people feel that I sometimes do the same things that someone like MS Dhoni does. It’s a big compliment, than a comparison. Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a legend and a captain of a World Cup-winning team. I don’t think I can be on the same platform as him. But I don’t try and emulate him. Whatever I’m doing, I do it in my own way and I am just glad that it is working,” she said.

‘This performance can do for women’s cricket what 1983 World Cup did for men’

Many believe women’s cricket could soon be on the same level as men’s cricket in terms of marketability and fan following – akin to the equality seen in tennis. Sushma says the revolution may have just begun in India. “I was going through some articles that said that the matches in this Women’s World Cup were the most watched women’s games in TV history. And slowly, the games will command the same viewership that men’s matches do. This performance can do for women’s cricket what the 1983 World Cup win did for the men’s game,” she said.

“Things have been changing recently and that is because we needed to do something extraordinary to attract attention towards women’s cricket. By reaching the final, we did that to an extent and fans, sponsors, everyone took notice. I think if we keep performing, things will keep improving,” she added.

US digital rights group slams tech firms for barring neo-Nazis,"A demonstrator holds signs during a rally in response to the Charlottesville, Virginia car attack on counter-protesters after the “Unite the Right” rally organized by white nationalists, in Oakland, California (Source: Reuters) A demonstrator holds signs during a rally in response to the Charlottesville, Virginia car attack on counter-protesters after the “Unite the Right” rally organized by white nationalists, in Oakland, California (Source: Reuters)

A digital rights group based in San Francisco on Thursday criticized several internet companies for removing neo-Nazi groups from servers and services, saying the actions were “dangerous” and threatened free expression online. GoDaddy Inc, Alphabet’s Google, security firm Cloudflare and other technology companies moved this week to block hate groups after weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white nationalists had gathered to protest removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a park.

“We strongly believe that what GoDaddy, Google, and Cloudflare did here was dangerous,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote in a blog post along with two other staffers. The blog post reflected years-long tension in Silicon Valley, where many company executives want to distance themselves from extremists but are concerned that picking and choosing what is acceptable on their platforms could invite more regulation from governments.

“Protecting free speech is not something we do because we agree with all of the speech that gets protected,” Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote. “We do it because the power to decide who gets to speak and who doesn’t is just too dangerous to hand to any company or any government.” The group called on companies that manage internet domain names, including Google and GoDaddy, to “draw a hard line” and not suspend or impair domain names “based on expressive content of websites or services.”

The blog post echoed concerns expressed by Cloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince, who on Wendnesday said he decided to drop coverage of neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer but said that his decision was conflicted. Prince told Reuters he “wholeheartedly agreed” with the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s post and said he was hopeful it would help spark a more thoughtful debate about internet regulation.

Google and GoDaddy did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the blog made outside normal business hours. The Daily Stormer helped organize the protest in Charlottesville, at which a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 people were injured when a vehicle drove into counter-protesters. The website cheered the woman’s death. It was removed from GoDaddy and Google Domains after they said they would not serve the website.

Boys don’t cry: Who are men really when they are alone?,"(Illustration: Subrata Dhar) (Illustration: Subrata Dhar)

I’m 19, razor thin, restless of mind, but overwhelmingly quiet. It has been a year since my father left town on a transfer, leaving mom behind to the hapless task of raising a bitter, confrontational boy. My maternal grandfather has just died. Three days after his last rites have been performed, I arrive at his home, after appearing for an exam. Every face I encounter is sombre, there is soreness in each eye. The women look distinctly bedraggled, lifeless. The men, all of them, are absent, either physically or emotionally. I see mom through the curtains that separate men from the women, sitting in a corner, surrounded by her sisters, blank and weak. My stomach suddenly collapses on me. I feel this surge, a wet force behind my eyes. My mind is a confused tangle of emotions over what is expected of me. I turn around and place myself in the huddle of men, somehow managing not to break into tears.

For at least 25 years of my life, I did not shed a tear. Not that I was clinically recording the fact, but, as far as memory serves right, I simply refused to give in whenever a situation arose — be it a death in the family, breakups, academic failures or even the sheer, physical pain of injury. Often my ideological tussles with dad, which I eventually lost, left me broken. Emotionally overwhelmed, I resorted to anger, even to insults, but never to the slow eloquence of wet-eyed stutters. To me, they were a mark of weakness, a “feminine” side that, like most men, I was raised to disown.

Masculinity means many things to many men. In my late teens, I interpreted it as the necessity to disagree or to hold a contrarian view. If dad looked west, I looked east merely because I felt I had the choice to do so. Defeats, whether physical or mental, at that age, can be jarring. Judgement is what a boy, in a crowd of hyper-masculine men, fears the most. I decided I would rather be alone than be judged, tying up with it my earliest ideas of dignity and self-respect. I made sure that while I did not gain in height, I did not lose anything in the eyes of those watching me.

The men that I came across, inside or outside home, exhibited an equal aversion to appearing vulnerable. They wanted to be strong, they believed themselves to be strong and they dismissed anything else as a sign of weakness. Auraton ki tarah roya matt karo (Don’t cry like a woman) — is a refrain that was both an insult and an injury to the likes of us.

Years later, I realised, there was a vacuum behind each stubborn face. A vacuum, it was espoused, women were marked to fill. Six years from the day I hid from my mother in broad daylight in a room in Pune, I broke into tears over a minor disagreement with a woman. I was tired of the charade, embarrassed too. For 25 years, I had taught myself to believe that the other side of the wall was where all the “real” men gathered. If you found yourself on the wrong side, as I did myself now, I would be earmarked as a pushover, considered either weak or feminine, or both.

I promised myself it was a one-off, never to be repeated — a warning, so to speak. But it was difficult to live up to that promise. I found myself breaking down more often, a lot more than expected. I started weeping as I watched movies, I cried when I longed for home and I sobbed my heart out when I failed to understand what was happening to me. It was like a dam had burst within.

Most men that boys look up to as role models are strong, stubborn characters, who radiate a kind of stony emotional strength. But what does it serve? All my life, growing up, I looked at dad and my uncles, as these incredibly sturdy men, who never wavered at moments of distress. But were they really impervious to grief and sorrow? Who were they, really, when they were alone? Did I know them? I wonder if they hid in washrooms and sobbed quietly or shed a drop in the pall of television-lit rooms when no one was looking. I wouldn’t think any less of them now if they did.

Two years ago, when my maternal grandmother died, I returned home to find my mother sobbing. This time, I did not turn my back on her. I hugged her and we wept together.

South African minister resigns amid assault probe,"South African President Jacob Zuma. (Reuters File Photo) South African President Jacob Zuma. (Reuters File Photo)

A South African deputy minister who is being investigated by police for allegedly assaulting a woman in a nightclub has resigned, the president’s office said on Saturday. Footage apparently showing deputy higher education minister Mduduzi Manana assaulting a woman earlier this month sparked outrage from civil society and opposition parties and prompted Manana to offer a public apology.

“President Jacob Zuma has received and accepted the resignation of the Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training, Mr Mduduzi Manana,” the presidency said in a statement. The police ministry confirmed earlier this month that a case of assault was being investigated against Manana and Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said “no one is above the law irrespective of their position in society”.

“The President has thanked Mr Manana for his contribution to the work of government during his term of office,” Zuma’s office said.

Harika Dronavalli faces first loss; stays in contention at Master’s tournament,"The Indian Grandmaster Harika Dronavalli failed to maintain her unbeaten run, losing to Romanian Grandmaster Bogdan-Daniel Deac in the fourth round of the Master’s tournament of the Abu Dhabi International Chess Festival.

The World No. 9 Indian, playing with black pieces, got off to a flying start and drew first blood as she took the Romanian’s pawn in the third move of the game. But Deac ended up taking complete points from the game after a total of 78 moves.

“In the latter stages of the game I complicated the game with a move which was not needed and my position just kept getting worse,” Harika said.

“Another inaccurate move at the end got me into a losing position. If I had not committed that mistake, I could’ve saved it,” she added.

Harika has now moved down to joint third having won two, drawn one and lost one.

She will take on her good friend and compatriot Eesha Karavade in the fifth round of the tournament on Saturday and will play the sixth round in the evening.

Her opponent for her sixth-round clash will solely be dependent on her result against Eesha.

Britain calls on EU to move Brexit talks forward,"Britain’s Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis. Reu Britain’s Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis. Reu

Brexit minister David Davis called on the European Union on Sunday to relax its position that the two sides must first make progress on a divorce settlement before moving on to discussing future relations. After a slow start to negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union, Britain is pressing for talks to move beyond the divorce to offer companies some assurance of what to expect after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.

This week, the government will issue five new papers to outline proposals for future ties, including how to resolve any future disputes without “the direct jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ)”, Davis said.

“I firmly believe the early round of the negotiations have already demonstrated that many questions around our withdrawal are inextricably linked to our future relationship,” Davis wrote in the Sunday Times newspaper.

“Both sides need to move swiftly on to discussing our future partnership, and we want that to happen after the European Council in October,” he wrote, saying the clock was ticking.

EU officials have said there must be “sufficient progress” in the first stage of talks on the rights of expatriates, Britain’s border with EU member Ireland and a financial settlement before they can consider a future relationship.

That has frustrated British officials, who say that until there has been discussion of future ties, including a new customs arrangement and some way of resolving any future disputes, they cannot solve the Irish border issue or financial settlement, two of the more difficult issues in the talks.

“There are financial obligations on both sides that will not be made void by our exit from the EU,” Davis wrote. “We are working to determine what these are – and interrogating the basis for the EU’s position, line by line, as taxpayers would expect us to do.”

He said the Brexit ministry would “advance our thinking further” with the new papers next week.

On the role of the ECJ, Davis said Britain’s proposals would be based on “precedents” which do not involve the “direct jurisdiction” of the court, which is hated by many pro-Brexit ministers in the governing Conservative Party.

EU officials say the court should guarantee the rights of EU citizens living or working in Britain after Brexit.

“Ultimately, the key question here is how we fairly consider and solve disputes for both sides,” Davis wrote.

Anger simmers in Philippines over Duterte’s drug war,"Loved ones of Leover Miranda, 39, a drug-related killings victim, pray in front of the coffin before a funeral march at the north cemetery in metro Manila, Philippines August 20, 2017.

REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco

Mourners at the funeral of a Philippine man who police shot dead protested his innocence on Sunday, the latest sign of rising anger over President Rodrigo Duterte’s bloody campaign to stamp out drugs. More than 12,500 people, many small-time drug users and dealers, have been killed since Duterte took office in June 2016. Police say about 3,500 of those killed were shot by officers in self-defence. Human rights monitors believe many of the remaining two thirds were killed by assassins operating with police backing or by police disguised as vigilantes – a charge the police deny. On Sunday, dozens of mourners wearing with white T-shirts with the slogan “Kill drugs, not people”, bore the coffin of Leover Miranda to his grave in a Manila cemetery.

Miranda was killed this month in what police said was a drug sting operation but relatives say he was innocent. “I want justice for my son,” Elvira Miranda, 69, told Reuters. “I have no powerful friends, I do not know what to do, but I want the people behind this senseless killing punished.”

Most people in the Philippines support the anti-drug campaign and Duterte remains a popular leader but questions have begun to be asked about the slaughter, with more than 90 people killed in a new surge of shootings in recent days. The country’s two most influential Catholic bishops on Sunday spoke against the latest deaths, asking the faithful to pray for the victims.

“We knock on the consciences of those who kill even the helpless, especially those who cover their faces … to stop wasting human lives,” said Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, archbishop of Manila. Another senior cleric, Archbishop Socrates Villegas, called for churches to ring their bells every evening at 8 p.m., to stir the consciences of the authorities. “You shall not kill. That is a sin. That is against the law,” he said in a statement.

Public anger rose last week when police killed a 17 year-old high-school student. Television channels aired CCTV footage that showed Kian Loyd Delos Santos being carried by two men to a place where his body was later found, raising doubt about an official report that said he was shot because he fired at police.

Some civil society groups and left-wing activists have called for protests increasing anger with the police was evident in social media posts. Metro Manila police chief Oscar Albayalde said he has suspended the police chief in Caloocan City, where the boy was killed, pending an investigation. Three officers involved in the operation were earlier relieved of duties.

The justice department has also begun an investigation while senators will also summon police this week to explain the sudden rise in killings.

Dark Eden,"Title: Swarga Author: Ambikasuthan mangad

Publication: Juggernaut

256 pages

Swarga is an ambitious attempt to fictionalise an ecocide that has been unravelling in Kasaragode district in Kerala for many years. Thousands of people, particularly children, have been afflicted by a host of debilitating diseases, that are blamed on the aerial spraying of Endosulphan, a pesticide, in cashew plantations ringing the Kasaragode ghats. The public debates triggered by the tragedy has raised fundamental questions about modern agricultural practices and the responsibility of public institutions towards citizens. Endosulphan spraying was banned in 2000 and reports from the region point to the regeneration of local flora and fauna that had disappeared when pesticide use was rampant in large government-plantations.

Swarga, first published to much acclaim in Malayalam as Enmakaje in 2009, tells the story of the villagers of Swarga, Enmakaje and many other such hamlets who fought the PCK, which meant the state itself. The novelist, Ambikasuthan Mangad, however, has sought to turn what could have been a dry, grim catalogue of data and protests into an epic about modern man’s search for meaning in a technology-mediated world of consumption.

His narrators are a couple who, disgusted with urban life, have taken refuge in the forests of the Jadadhari hill in the shadow of which lies Swarga. Mangad calls them the Man and the Woman, since the two had decided to strip themselves of their past, identities and memories, when they left the city to retire to the jungle. Their attempt to reject an anthropomorphic worldview and journey back to a life in nature almost becomes a parable of the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, retracing the steps back to the Garden of Eden. When the woman — her name, we are told later, is Devayani — returns home with an orphan, the Man revolts. However, the baby, who turns out to be a stunted child, exposes them to the world beyond their Eden.

It is a world of a people, whose ancestors had sinned against nature and built a society of exploitation. The couple joins the struggle launched by a visiting activist, a local doctor and a journalist to bring justice to the people. The novel ends with a manipulative politician attacked by a golden serpent, who had worked against the interests of the people, and the couple, Devayani and Neelakantan, finding their awakening in a cave in the Jadadhari hill.

The patches, where Mangad tries to sketch a life for the couple in the city, jars the narrative. Blame it on the activist self of Mangad, parts of the novel assume a didactic tone which disturbs the philosphical armature he seeks for the subject. These anomalies, however, do not detract from the novel’s importance as flagging a seminal issue of our time: How best do we build our lives without violating the basic tenets of life itself.

At least 39 held for trying to trigger religious animosity in Ernakulam: Police,"At least 39 suspected members of a little known Islamic outfit were arrested on Sunday at Vadakkekara in Ernakulam district on charges of attempting to trigger a religious animosity in the society, the police said. They added that the accused were placed under arrest after scrutinising the contents of the pamphlets, bearing the name of an outfit called the Wisdom Global Islamic Mission, seized from their possession.

The accused were charged under section 153A, IPC (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), Ernakulam Rural Superintendent of Police (SP) A V George told reporters.

The accused had allegedly distributed the pamphlets at eight places in and around Vadakkekara, near North Paravur in the district, after splitting themselves into eight groups. The pamphlets allegedly contained objectionable contents. Through the pamphlets, the accused had allegedly asked the non-Muslims to denounce their respective religions and embrace Islam, the SP said, adding that their activities were “extremist” in nature.

A probe was on to ascertain if the accused had any links with any extremist outfit based on foreign soil, the police said.

Bangladesh sends back Rohingya boat carrying injured,"A coastguard patrol boat found the boat on the Naf river, which acts as a border between Bangladesh and Myanmar, as it tried to enter Cox’s Bazar early in the morning. A coastguard patrol boat found the boat on the Naf river, which acts as a border between Bangladesh and Myanmar, as it tried to enter Cox’s Bazar early in the morning.

Bangladesh coastguards today turned back a boat carrying 31 Rohingya Muslim refugees escaping renewed army activity in their neighbouring Myanmar homeland, an official said. The push-back came after at least 500 Rohingya fled their villages in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, crossing the border to take shelter in refugee camps and hills in Bangladesh’s southeastern Cox’s Bazar district.

A coastguard patrol boat found the boat on the Naf river, which acts as a border between Bangladesh and Myanmar, as it tried to enter Cox’s Bazar early in the morning. The refugees included women and children who said they were victims of violence, coast guard spokesman Sheikh Fakhr Uddin said quoting the escapees.

“We found two injured among 18 men, along with nine women and four children. But we had to send them back,” Uddin told AFP. The latest influx follows a months-long bloody military crackdown on the mainly Muslim minority in Myanmar that led tens of thousands to flee across the border. The United Nations has said the violence may amount to ethnic cleansing.

“We have beefed up our patrol on the Naf as (Myanmar) army is gathering in the bordering villages, which may prompt them (Rohingya) to try coming to Bangladesh,” Uddin said. Dhaka estimates that nearly 400,000 Rohingya refugees are living in squalid refugee camps and makeshift settlements in Cox’s Bazar, which borders Rakhine.

Their numbers swelled last October when more than 70,000 Rohingya villagers began arriving, bringing stories of systematic rape, murder and arson at the hands of Myanmar soldiers. Last week, the UN special rapporteur Yanghee Lee voiced alarm at reports that a Myanmar army battalion had flown into Rakhine to help local authorities boost security in the region.

Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long faced criticism for its treatment of the more than one million Rohingya who live in Rakhine, who are seen as interlopers from Bangladesh, denied citizenship and access to basic rights.

But they are also increasingly unwelcome in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, where police often blame them for crimes such as drug trafficking. Dhaka has floated the idea of relocating tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees to a remote, flood-prone island off its coast, despite opposition from rights groups.

"In Kolkata, pregnant nurse ‘kills self’, husband held","Arpita’s family claimed she had last spoken to her mother on Thursday. “She said there was lot of tension in the house. However, she said she would go for night duty at the hospital. (Representational) Arpita’s family claimed she had last spoken to her mother on Thursday. “She said there was lot of tension in the house. However, she said she would go for night duty at the hospital. (Representational)

A 23-YEAR-OLD pregnant nurse allegedly committed suicide at her residence in Burtolla area of Kolkata in the wee hours of Friday. Following this, her husband was arrested. The deceased, Arpita Chatterjee, was allegedly found dead in her nurse’s uniform at a time when she should have been on duty at Srijoni Healing Home, a private hospital.

Later, Arpita’s mother Shibani Bera lodged a police complaint against son-in-law Shankodweep Chatterjee — a manager at a private hotel — his mother Subhra and brother Sudip and they were booked under sections 498A (cruelty at the hands of husband or his relatives), 306 (abetment to suicide) and 34 (act done by several person with common intention) of IPC.

While Shankodweep has claimed Arpita hanged herself from a ceiling fan, her parents alleged she was tortured and killed by her in-laws. “Preliminary postmortem examination report suggests she committed suicide. However, the matter is under investigation and hence, he has been arrested… Initial investigation found that while the girl was fond of non-vegetarian food, the boy’s family was vegetarian. The in-laws had issues with having non-vegetarian food at home. This used to lead to regular fights,” said a police officer.

The two had been in a relationship for six years before marrying on January 22, said police. “According to Shankodweep Chatterjee, he and his wife had a fight over food, following which, he left for office. He too was on night duty at the hotel and apparently returned home around 12.50 am to find Arpita’s room locked from inside. He said he broke open the door and found her hanging… He said he brought her body down and informed the police. She was taken to R G Kar Medical College and Hospital, where she was declared brought dead on arrival,” said a police officer.

Sonali Nag, Arpita’s sister, said: “Yesterday, my sister was supposed to report for night duty at hospital but instead, was found dead in her uniform. They have tortured her to death….” “It was a love marriage. But after she went to stay with her in-laws, the real picture came to light. They would fight over smallest things. She was five months pregnant, but her mother-in-law never gave her proper food. She had told us about this but we thought as she had recently got married, slowly things will settle down,” she said.

Arpita’s family claimed she had last spoken to her mother on Thursday. “She said there was lot of tension in the house. However, she said she would go for night duty at the hospital. Later, her mother kept calling but no one picked up. Around 1 am, her husband took the call and said that Arpita had hanged herself,” said a family member. “We reached her house within a few minutes, but by then, they had already brought the body down… She would not have killed herself,” the relative said.

"Barcelona terror attack: Spain hunts for driver in Las Ramblas van rampage, says Islamist cell dismantled","Police officers stand at a road block at the beginning of fiestas in Bilbao, Spain August 19, 2017, after a van ran down pedestrians in Barcelona’s Las Ramblas on Thursday. (Source: Reuters) Police officers stand at a road block at the beginning of fiestas in Bilbao, Spain August 19, 2017, after a van ran down pedestrians in Barcelona’s Las Ramblas on Thursday. (Source: Reuters)

Police were searching on Saturday for the driver of a van that killed 13 people when it ploughed into a crowd in Barcelona and were trying to determine whether two other suspected Islamist militants linked to the attack had died or were at large. The Spanish government said it considered it had dismantled the cell behind Thursday’s Barcelona rampage and an attack early on Friday in the Catalan seaside town of Cambrils.

Police arrested four people in connection with the attacks Barcelona and Cambrils, where a woman was killed when a car rammed passersby on Friday. Five attackers wearing fake explosive belts were also shot dead in the Catalan town.

“The cell has been fully dismantled in Barcelona, after examining the people who died, the people who were arrested and carrying out identity checks,” Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido told a news conference. But authorities have yet to identify the driver of the van and his whereabouts are unclear, while police and officials in the northeastern region of Catalonia said they still needed to locate up to two other people. Investigators are focusing on a group of at least 12 suspects believed to be behind the deadliest attacks to hit Spain in more than a decade.

In little more than a year, militants have used vehicles as weapons to kill nearly 130 people in France, Germany, Britain, Sweden and Spain. None of the nine people arrested or shot dead by police are believed to be the driver who sped into Las Ramblas, leaving a trail of dead and injured among the crowds of tourists and local residents strolling along the Barcelona boulevard. A Moroccan-born 22-year-old called Younes Abouyaaqoub was among those being sought, according to the mayor’s office in the Catalan town of Ripoll, where he and other suspects lived.

Spanish media reported that Abouyaaqoub may have been the driver of the van in Barcelona, but police and Catalan officials could not confirm this.

The driver in the Barcelona attack abandoned the van and fled on foot on Thursday after ploughing into the crowd. Fifty people were still in hospital on Saturday following that attack, with 13 in a critical condition. Many were foreign tourists. The Mediterranean region of Catalonian is thronged in the summer months with visitors drawn to its beaches and the port city of Barcelona’s museums and tree-lined boulevards. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks in Cambrils and Barcelona, a statement by the jihadist group said on Saturday.

RAIDS

Police searched a flat in Ripoll on Friday in their hunt for people connected to the attacks, the ninth raid so far on homes in the town nestled in the foothills of the Pyrenees near the French border. The flat had been occupied by a man named as Abdelbaki Es Satty, according to a search warrant seen by Reuters. Neighbours said he was an imam, a Muslim prayer leader. His landlord said he had last been seen on Tuesday. Scraps of paper covered in notes were strewn around the flat, which had been turned upside down in the police search.

Three Moroccans and a citizen of Spain’s North African enclave of Melilla have been arrested so far in connection with the attacks. Apart from Abouyaaqoub, authorities are searching for two other people though it is not certain they are at large. One or even both of them may have been killed in Alcanar, where a house was razed by an explosion shortly before midnight on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Catalonia’s home affairs department said. Casting new doubts over the investigation, El Pais said late on Saturday that biological remains of at least three people had been found in the ruins of the Alcanar house. It was not clear whether they could be from the three suspects still sought by the police or if more people were there.

Police believe the house in Alcanar was being used to plan one or several large-scale attacks in Barcelona, possibly using a large number of butane gas canisters stored there.

The Spanish government maintained its security alert level at four, one notch below the maximum level that would indicate another attack was imminent, but said it would reinforce security in crowded areas and tourist hotspots. Spanish media also said that security at the border with France was being beefed up.

TRIBUTES

Of the 14 dead in the two attacks, five are Spanish, two are Italians, two are Portuguese, one Belgian, one Canadian and one a U.S. citizen, emergency services and authorities from those countries have confirmed so far. A seven-year-old boy with British and Australian nationality who had been missing since the attack in Barcelona was found on Saturday in one of the city’s hospitals and was in a serious condition, El Pais newspaper reported.

Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia on Saturday visited some of the dozens injured whose nationalities ranged from French and German to Pakistani and the Filipino. They are being treated in various Barcelona hospitals. The royal couple are expected to take part in a Catholic mass on Sunday morning at architect Antoni Gaudi’s famous Sagrada Familia church, a Barcelona landmark, in honour of the victims of the attack.

Barcelona’s football team will wear special shirts, bearing the Catalan words for “We are all Barcelona”, and black armbands in memory of victims when they play their opening league game of the season on Sunday evening against Real Betis.

"People must pledge their organs, says PGI Director","Through the campaign, ROTTO collaborated with multiple organisations to spread awareness, said PGI. Through the campaign, ROTTO collaborated with multiple organisations to spread awareness, said PGI.

PEOPLE MUST come forward, pledge their organs and inform their families about the decision as the move will save thousands who die for want of organs, said PGIMER Director Professor Jagat Ram on Saturday. Ram, who was addressing the concluding ceremony of ROTTO (Regional Organ & Tissue Transplant Organisation), PGIMER’s organ donation awareness campaign, said the problem of low donation rates can be overcome by engaging with multiple stakeholders through awareness drives. The Union Health Ministry has designated PGI as ROTTO for the northern region in 2016.

On the occasion, the director, felicitated 28 volunteers, including students, teachers and NSS coordinators from various schools of the city who had spearheaded various infotainment activities organised to promote organ donation during the campaign launched on August 3 by ROTTO PGI. Through the campaign, ROTTO collaborated with multiple organisations to spread awareness, said PGI.

Dr Vipin Koushal, Nodal Officer, ROTTO PGI, said potential donors do not convert into actual donors due to lack of knowledge, awareness and socio-cultural views. So, to address this issue, “ROTTO has been proactively tapping multiple windows of opportunities to embed awareness about organ donation in public conscience,” he added.

Over the years, ROTTO has been creating awareness among people on deceased organ donation to garner traction for the cause. PGIMER is also witnessing an increasing trend in organ donation with 33 cadaver organ donations having already taken place this year till date compared to 27 in 2016. Till date, the transplants done by PGIMER are kidney: 3,586 (live 3,340; cadaver 246); liver: 32; heart: 4; pancreas: 11, lung: 1 and cornea: 3,405.

India come into the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka as the more pumped up and confident side. The top-ranked Test side showed once again why they are at the pinnacle of the sport and specifically the format. Virat Kohli-led India went from one Test to another, one venue to another and didn’t drop their momentum or focus. In fact, even with the series done and dusted, India went for even more to win the third Test by an innings and 171 runs. This after two Test wins by 304 runs and an innings and 53 runs.

The focus now shifts to the white ball and coloured kits in the five match ODI series. Even the change in format might not help Sri Lanka’s confidence do a world of good. Before India’s arrival, Sri Lanka were beaten 2-3 by 11th ranked Zimbabwe in the ODIs. And prior to that, Sri Lanka crashed out in group stages of the ICC Champions Trophy following a hapless fielding show.

India, on the other hand, reached the final of the ICC Champions Trophy but lost to Pakistan. They then went to West Indies and won the five-match ODI series 3-1 with one match washed out.

"Henrik Stenson leads by one in Greensboro, Davis Love three back","Henrik Stenson reeled off three consecutive birdies to earn a one-shot lead. (Source: AP) Henrik Stenson reeled off three consecutive birdies to earn a one-shot lead. (Source: AP)

Swede Henrik Stenson remained patient before reeling off three consecutive birdies to earn a one-shot lead after the third round at the Wyndham Championship on Saturday.

A double-bogey at the par-three seventh proved only a temporary setback for Stenson, who carded four-under-par 66 on another ideal day for low scoring at Sedgefield Country Club.

The 2016 British Open champion posted a 16-under 194 total, with Americans Webb Simpson (68), Kevin Na (65) and Ollie Schniederjans (66) at 15-under.

The 53-year-old Davis Love, seeking to become the oldest PGA Tour winner, shot 67 to trail by three shots. Love, already the third oldest winner after his success at the tournament two years ago, surged into contention with an outward nine of four-under 31, but stalled on the inward half.

Stenson, on the other hand, made his move late. “Things weren’t going great in the middle of the round but I was hanging in there and hit a couple of nice shots and made a couple of putts coming home and we find ourselves right where we want to be for Sunday,” said the world number nine.

“I hit a lot of good putts and I’ve been hitting a lot of good iron shots as well, trying to attack the hole and that’s been working nicely so far.

“I’ve been in contention a lot this year so it feels nice to be out there again. I feel I’m in a good place mentally.” Stenson’s two dropped shots at the par-three seventh came after his mishit seven-iron found a water hazard short of the green.

Simpson, the 2011 champion, led late in the round until a bogey at the 17th. “I’m very hungry to win again but right now I got dinner on my mind,” said Simpson, a four-time tour winner, including the 2012 U.S. Open.

Na, also one back, is seeking his second tour victory, while Schniederjans is after his first. Johnson Wagner is two behind after a 65 that included an eagle from 95 yards at the par-four first, following up his second round albatross which he made with a five-iron from 215 yards at the par-five fifth.

Sunil Grover and Chandan Prabhakar’s Twitter conversation is a throwback to The Kapil Sharma Show days,"Sunil Grover and Chandan Prabhakar were part of The Kapil Sharma Show. Sunil Grover and Chandan Prabhakar were part of The Kapil Sharma Show.

Sunil Grover and Chandan Prabhakar rose to fame when they got into the limelight for the infamous mid-air spat with Kapil Sharma. While the latter chose to forgive Kapil for his behaviour, the former, who has become dear to everyone who has been a fan of The Kapil Sharma Show, has chosen to stay away from any sort of professional connect with Kapil. However, this decision of Chandan Prabhakar has definitely not affected Sunil’s affection towards his co-star, and this Twitter conversation between the two is a sign of the same.

Recently, Chandan posted a picture of himself posing in front of the huge villa and captioned it as, “Sometimes posture of ur body defines u…love”, and commenting on the same picture, Sunil asked what he wanted to portray with this picture. Sunil tweeted to Chandan, “In this picture what r u trying to define, the poster of ur body or beauty of the building behind you?” to which his The Kapil Sharma Show co-star wrote, “Hahaha…paji my posture is bcoz of the beauty of the building.”

Well, this definitely gives us a glimpse of how good friends Sunil and Chandan are. By the way, Chandan and Kapil too are good friends and have known each other since college time.

For a long time, people assumed that things are still sour between the comedian-turned-actor Kapil and Sunil, but both over the period of last few months have been proving that they have let bygones be bygones, and moving on for better opportunities that future has for each one of them.

While it looks like Sunil has still not given a go ahead for any television shows, he is definitely keeping his audience entertained by conducting his own shows or making special appearances on different award shows. On the other hand, Kapil has been promoting his upcoming film, Firangi.

“IF WE have to really make economic impact through science and technology and improve our position in the Global Innovation Index, then we have to ensure that collaborative research and development (R&D) programmes in educational institutions, industries and research laboratories are done at a much faster pace,” said Dr V K Saraswat, Member of NITI Aayog and Chancellor of JNU.

Saraswat visited Panjab University on Saturday to inaugurate a high-profile round table meet, titled Developing Country Specific Models for the Promotion of R&D via Public Private Partnership Mode, organised by the DST-Centre for Policy Research, PU. While interacting with mediapersons, he said he had come to promote Industry-Academia Partnership of Science, Technology and Innovation Policy of the Government of India.

Commenting about the lack of funding for R&D promotions, he said, “Certainly, the required funding for the R&D promotion is missing and this is the reason that R&D in the academic institutes is defused and they are not working with a focused goal. At present, the country is spending only 1 per cent while the percentage of foreign countries is between 2 and 3 per cent. Both public and private need to invest significantly in R&D to support innovation.”

Appreciating PU’s efforts, Saraswat said it is commendable that the varsity has compiled the entire information under the leadership of Professor Rupinder Tiwari on India’s R&D system and the basic purpose of this meet was to bring the entire domain of policies for research and technical development so that the synergy between industry, academia and national laboratories could be improved. So, what is the main focus of NITI Aayog? He replied, “NITI Aayog is focusing on heath, agriculture, education, Make in India and other schemes of Government of India initiated by the Prime Minister.”

"Push students towards entrepreneurship, research; achieve global rank: CM Kejriwal asks DTU","He gave the university a month to submit a blueprint on is strategy to achieve a global rank. He gave the university a month to submit a blueprint on is strategy to achieve a global rank.

With a need to push students to become job creators or invest their energy in research, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday asked Delhi Technical University to think of a plan to gain a position among top 10 technical institutes in the world.

During the inauguration of the East Delhi campus, in Vivek Vihar Phase II, the CM asked the institute to nurture at least 50 per cent of its students to become entrepreneurs.

“I request students to become job creators so that they can provide employment to others. Thereafter, there will be a decline in the unemployment in the country,” said Kejriwal, adding that education is the backbone of the country’s success and students who become job creators after graduation will not only contribute to society, but will also aid in nation-building. He further stressed on the importance of research.

“Research should be to benefit common people and students. Through research, university can find exact demands of industrialists and the government will provide all resources to it. I want the DTU to become number one in the field of research,” he said.

“I also want the university to rank among top 10 technological universities in the world,” he said. He gave the university a month to submit a blueprint on is strategy to achieve the above points.

“This government is focusing on education. When the AAP government was formed (in February), state-run schools were in a bad state. Manish Sisodia (education minister) transformed the government’s schools,” said CM Kejriwal, adding that the AAP government is trying to invest in the promotion of “smart citizens”.

Classes for the new batch at DTU will begin on August 21 and about 300 students have gained admission to various courses at the university this academic year.

"IGNOU to train 11,884 Tripura teachers, signs MoC with state for two-year diploma course","The IGNOU registrar and the director of SCERT Tripura on Friday signed the MoC. The IGNOU registrar and the director of SCERT Tripura on Friday signed the MoC.

The School of Education (SOE) of the The Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) is collaborating with the government of Tripura on order to provide professional training to 11,884 teachers at the elementary level. The university signed a Memorandum of Collaboration (MoC) with the state government for this purpose on Friday.

Only those teachers “who possess the qualifications stipulated as per the NCTE norms and are working in government o government-recognized primary or elementary schools” will be considered eligible for the programme which is a two-year diploma in elementary education. Candidates of reserved categories will be subject to relaxation of marks for eligibility, according to a press release by the university.

The course will be imparted in the form of open distance learning (ODL) and aims to “familiarize all enrolled teachers with dimensions of elementary education in Tripura.”

“Two years down the lane there was not much Training Learning Materials (TLMs) available for training the untrained teachers. The challenge for us was to come up with something that was meaningful and totally required to professionally upgrade the untrained teachers,” IGNOU SOE and programme coordinator Poonam Bhushan said.

The IGNOU registrar and the director of SCERT Tripura on Friday signed the MoC which would ensure that the training would be conducted in phases and will enroll only 100 students at each programme study centre.

“Now, even the SCERT has developed a lot of materials for reference and IGNOU has also emerged to be strong. The DIETS/ teaching faculty are much trained today as compared to the past two years to carry forward this programme. While the SLMs can do their job, it is the practical component that should be organized by the state government for a successful completion of training them,” Bhushan said.

Statue defaced as US Confederate monument protests grow after Charlottesville violence,"Damage is seen to the face of a statue of Confederate commander General Robert E. Lee at Duke University’s Duke Chapel in Durham, North Carolina. (Source: Reuters) Damage is seen to the face of a statue of Confederate commander General Robert E. Lee at Duke University’s Duke Chapel in Durham, North Carolina. (Source: Reuters)

A statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee was defaced at North Carolina’s Duke University and there were more arrests on Thursday over the toppling of a similar statue as communities in the U.S. South faced a contentious debate over such divisive monuments. The discovery came as President Donald Trump stoked the controversy over the statues, echoing white nationalists by decrying the removal of what he said were “beautiful” monuments to the pro-slavery Confederacy.

The statue of Lee at the Duke Chapel in Durham, North Carolina, was found early on Thursday with its nose and other facial features chipped off, the university said in a statement. Lee led the Confederate Army during the American Civil War.

The university said that surveillance camera footage was being reviewed for clues as to who was behind the attack on the statue, which stands by the chapel entrance. Security around the site is also being stepped up. A fresh debate over Confederate symbols has roiled the United States since Saturday’s violence during a protest by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, against the removal of a Lee statue in which one woman died.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer is due to make an announcement on Friday about the statue, public safety at future events, and the legacy of Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old woman who was killed, Signer’s office said in a statement. Also in Durham, four people surrendered on Thursday to face rioting and other charges stemming from the toppling of a statue of a Confederate soldier by protesters there, the Durham County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. That brought the number arrested in connection with Monday’s toppling to eight.

More than 100 people meanwhile staged a peaceful demonstration at the local courthouse, the sheriff’s office said. Many of them claimed they were involved in Monday’s action and demanded to be arrested too, according to local news reports and footage posted on social media.

“Deputies did not arrest rally participants who approached them claiming responsibility for the destruction of a historical statue,” the sheriff’s office said in its statement. In Helena, Montana, the city council voted on Wednesday to remove a Confederate fountain from a park. Democratic Governor Steve Bullock said the decision marked the removal of the last monument to the Confederacy in the northwest Rocky Mountains.

San Diego city officials on Wednesday also removed a plaque to Confederate President Jefferson Davis from a downtown plaza, local media said. In Arizona, tar and feathers coated a monument for the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway, about 40 miles east of Phoenix, local TV news footage showed.

"I don’t like the word diet, says fitness expert Yasmin Karachiwala","” I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.” ” I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.”

Celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala, who has trained the likes of Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt and Katrina Kaif, says she doesn’t like the word “diet”.

“I don’t like the word diet. I think we all are smart and making smart food choices is a lifestyle change. I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them,” Karachiwala told IANS over e-mail. The celebrated fitness trainer, who has been roped in as the official fitness expert for sports and lifestyle brand Skechers, added: “I don’t recommend any diet”. Along with being a popular name in the fitness sector, Karachiwala, who owns a gym — Body Image in the suburbs of Mumbai, is also the first BASI certified Pilates instructor in India and established the first Pilates studio.

Pilates is a system of exercises using special apparatus, designed to improve physical strength, flexibility and posture, and enhance mental awareness. Asked how Pilates is more beneficial than other forms of exercise, Karachiwala said: “Pilates helps strengthen the core and works the body from the inside out. It helps prevent injuries. I suggest doing it along with any other exercise and see how it makes you perform that exercise even better.”

Being in the fitness industry for over two decades, Karachiwala has helped Bollywood big-wigs like Deepika, Katrina, Alia, Sonakshi Sinha, Malaika Arora Khan, Zareen Khan and more to achieve the perfect frame.

What’s the biggest challenge she faces while training a Bollywood personality?

“I think to achieve different looks for a specific role is always a good challenge as if giving us an end goal. Challenges are good as it keeps you and your client motivated,” she said. Asked with whose transformation she was really proud of, Karachiwala replied: “All my clients work extremely hard. It’s not easy with their schedules but they are all dedicated to their workouts and I’m proud of them.”

It is often said that Bollywood personalities take supplements to modify their body according to their roles in films. What do you have to say to that? Karachiwala replied: “I don’t believe in supplements as such I think naturally. If we eat healthy, our body can get most of its nutrients. Of course, sometimes vegetarians have a problem with protein so then a plant based protein shake is what I would suggest.”

Pack right before travelling during monsoon season,"Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for nigh t time. (Source: File Photo) Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for nigh t time. (Source: File Photo)

Before going on a trip during the rainy season, it is important to carry the right tools and instruments to save your belongings like cellphone and wallet from drenching. Carry zip lock bags, umbrellas, mosquito repellents and waterproof backpacks, suggest experts.

Narayana Menon K, co-founder at Wandertrails, an online platform enabling discovery and booking of experiences, has listed a few necessary items:

* Arm yourself with an umbrella or raincoat. A waterproof backpack is a must-have.

* Always carry a zip lock bag. It is good to keep the wallet and other expensive belongings safe as well like the smartphone and maybe other equipments like camera and lenses.

* It is the season when mosquito-borne diseases are rampant with stagnant puddles and blocked drains everywhere. Carry mosquito repellents, creams or a mosquito net for night time.

* It is best to carry own water, otherwise, drink only boiled water. The same goes for food, don’t eat from just anywhere. Street food is extremely difficult to say not to, at least make sure it is covered.

* Carry light synthetic clothes that will dry easily.

* Floaters and sandals are the best options in terms of footwear.

Inputs from Aloke Bajpai, CEO at ixigo, travel search engine:

* Having street food during the rainy season can be very unhygienic. Carry sachets of herbal teas and packaged food. Also, don’t drink water from unsealed bottles or the regular running tap.

* Always carry a first-aid box in case of an emergency. The probability of catching cold and falling sick during the rainy season is more than during any other time of the year.

* If planning to visit a new destination, always know how you can get help if stranded – the intensity of rain that the region receives, and emergency contact information of the local authorities. It is advisable to make reservations beforehand to ensure a safe journey.

* Chances of a power outage during a rainy day are more as compared to normal days. To keep phone active, it’s important to carry a power bank all the time.

* As it might get dark early, keep a flashlight. Don’t rely on the phone’s flashlight.

* It’s good to carry some extra plastic bags to keep electronics safe. They can also be used to keep wet clothes and food items.

No 75-year age limit for contesting elections: Amit Shah,"BJP National Preisdent Amit Shah. (PTI Photo) BJP National Preisdent Amit Shah. (PTI Photo)

More than a year after two ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government were removed because they had crossed 75 years, BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday asserted that there was no such formula, rule or tradition that those above 75 cannot contest elections. “Madhya Pradesh me kisko rakhna hai, kisko nahi rakhna hai, ye CM ka adhikar hai,” Shah said in response to a question on whether those above 75 would be denied tickets in the next Assembly elections or kept away from important positions.

Veterans Babulal Gaur and Sartaj Singh, who held home and forest portfolios, respectively, were dropped as ministers last year and apparently told that the BJP had decided to follow this formula at the national level. Chouhan had earlier suggested that the decision to remove the two ministers was taken at the state level.

Reacting to reports that the BJP was eying 350 seats in the next general elections, Shah claimed there was no such target. “We have decided to strengthen our organisation at every seat in the country,” he said. Later, he said the party would not fix a low target like 350 and could even exceed it.

“Even today we are in majority and yet we are in the NDA,’’ he said when asked whether the alliance would remain intact in future. When asked about Election Commissioner O P Rawat’s comment about parties placing premium on winning elections at all costs, the BJP chief said he probably had the Congress’s herding of Gujarat MLAs at a Bengaluru resort in mind.

Northwestern University professor and Oxford staffer extradited to Chicago in stabbing case,"Wyndham Lathem arrives at a police station as he is escorted by Chicago police on Saturday in Chicago. (AP Photo) Wyndham Lathem arrives at a police station as he is escorted by Chicago police on Saturday in Chicago. (AP Photo)

Two employees of elite universities charged in the fatal stabbing of a 26-year-old hair stylist were returned to Chicago early Saturday to face charges of first-degree murder in the brutal killing. Chicago police escorted fired Northwestern University professor Wyndham Lathem, 43, and Oxford University financial officer Andrew Warren, 56, from Northern California, where they surrendered peacefully on Aug. 4 after an eight-day, nationwide manhunt.

The men are accused of killing Trenton James Cornell-Duranleau, a Michigan native who had been living in Chicago, last month in Lathem’s high-rise Chicago condo. They may appear in court in Chicago as early as Saturday. Chicago police have said Cornell-Duranleau suffered more than 40 stab wounds, including “mutilations,” to his upper body. Authorities say the attack was so violent the blade of the knife they believe was used was broken.

They found Cornell-Duranleau’s body July 27 after the building’s front desk received an anonymous call that a crime had occurred on the 10th floor. He had been dead more than 12 hours. By then, authorities say Lathem and Warren had fled the city. According to autopsy results released Friday by the Cook County medical examiner’s office, Cornell-Duranleau had methamphetamine in his system at the time of his death.

Police say Lathem and Cornell-Duranleau, who moved to Chicago about a year ago, had a personal relationship, though they have not described the nature of it or a motive for the attack. It’s unclear what the relationship was between Lathem, Cornell-Duranleau and Warren, who’s British. He arrived in the U.S. three days before the killing, after being reported missing in Great Britain.

Lathem, a microbiologist who’s been on Northwestern’s faculty since 2007 but was not teaching at the time of the attack, was terminated by the university for fleeing from police when there was an arrest warrant out for him.

Investigators said at some point after the killing, Lathem sent a video to friends and relatives apologizing for his involvement in the crime, which he called the “biggest mistake of my life.” The video raised concern among investigators that Lathem might kill himself.

Lathem and Warren both appeared in court in California last week, where they agreed to return to Illinois to face charges. An attorney for Lathem, Kenneth H. Wine, called him a “gentle soul” and said “what he is accused of is totally contrary to the way he has lived his entire life.” Wine said Lathem intends to plead not guilty to the charges.

Warren was represented by a public defender during a brief appearance in a San Francisco court. She said he is “presumed innocent,” but declined to comment further.

"England-West Indies series could be the saddest for Test cricket, says Michael Vaughan","England spanked West Indies by an innings and 209 runs in the first match of the series. (Source: Reuters) England spanked West Indies by an innings and 209 runs in the first match of the series. (Source: Reuters)

Former England skipper Michael Vaughan reckons this three-match Test series between England and West Indies “could be the saddest” considering the massive gap between the two teams. An example of it was provided on Saturday when West Indies batting went down like bowling pins to concede 19 wickets in a single day’s play of the day-night Test. It helped England to register a thumping inning and 209 runs victory at Edgbaston.

Such has been England’s dominance over West Indies or Caribbean teams’ apathy on their tours that they’ve not won a Test in England in 17 years.

“Every time they have arrived in England, they seem to have got worse,” Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special. “There are a lot of young players in the West Indies side and you need to give them time, but I find it difficult to think they can go on without any senior players,” added Vaughan.

“There is no one there to teach them. I really fear that this series could be one of the saddest for Test cricket.”

West Indies are without senior and experienced players in Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo and Darren Sammy due to a disagreement with the West Indies Cricket Board over contracts and team selection. The West Indies team have gone from world beaters in the 1980s to not being able to win an away series since 1995 unless your name is Zimbabwe or Bangladesh.

England were rated as the worst team in the world in 1999 and now are third best in the world and come into the series having beaten South Africa 3-1 in their backyard. “I don’t think this era of cricket is any different to any other era,” said England coach Trevor Bayliss. “There have always been strong teams and one or two that are struggling. West Indies are going through a rough time but 20, 40, 60 years ago there were other teams that were going through rough periods.”

The wife of renowned Polish-US playwright and screenwriter Janusz Glowacki says he has died at 78. Popular in New York and Polish artistic and intellectual circles, Glowacki was the author of award-winning plays “Antigone in New York” and “The Fourth Sister,” which set classic themes in the contemporary world.

Born in 1938 in Poznan, western Poland, he made a name for himself in the 1960s with short stories and screenplays, including for Poland’s leading filmmaker Andrzej Wajda. He settled in New York in the early 1980s, choosing not to return to Poland after its communist authorities imposed martial law.

He did return to Warsaw after the 1989 ouster of communist rule. Actress Olena Leonenko-Glowacka said Glowacki died Saturday.

Britain will not exclude possible EU oversight of UK borders after Brexit,"British Prime Minister Theresa May (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, file) British Prime Minister Theresa May (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert, file)

Britain will not rule out the possibility that the European Union may retain oversight of customs controls at UK borders after it leaves the bloc, as the country seeks ways to keep unhindered access to EU markets following Brexit. Last week, the UK published a policy document proposing two possible models for British-EU customs arrangements after withdrawal from the EU in 2019.

The first model was a “highly streamlined customs arrangement” which involved the re-introduction of a customs border but which envisaged electronic tracking of shipments, rather than physical checks of goods and documents at the border. An alternative proposal was the “new customs partnership” which would remove the need for a UK-EU customs border altogether.

Under this model, the UK would operate as if it was still part of the bloc for customs purposes. British goods would be exported tariff-free and Britain would levy EU tariffs on goods coming into the UK for onward passage to the EU directly or as components in UK export goods. However, lawyers said there would be a need for a mechanism to oversee the “new customs partnership” to ensure that the UK was correctly monitoring goods coming into the UK and destined for Europe. The EU’s system of movement of goods across EU borders without checks works on the basis that all members closely monitor shipments coming into the bloc from outside, to ensure the correct tariffs are paid and that goods meet EU standards.

WEAKNESSES

The EU anti-fraud agency OLAF polices customs agencies across Europe to ensure they are correctly monitoring imports. OLAF has the powers to conduct on-the-spot inspections and seek information from customs bodies. If OLAF finds weaknesses in a country’s systems and that the member is not charging the appropriate duties on imports from outside the EU, it will recommend that the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, should recover money from the offending member.

For example, in March OLAF slammed lax UK border controls and recommended the European Commission reclaim 2 billion euros the agency said was lost because Britain had failed to apply the correct EU duties on imports of Chinese clothes and footwear in recent years.

A spokesman for the UK’s tax authority said it questioned OLAF’s estimate of lost revenue. Duties collected are paid to Brussels. Commission duty recovery claims can be appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), the EU’s highest court.

UK Prime Minster Theresa May has said the UK will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of the ECJ after Britain’s exit from the bloc. However, the British finance ministry declined to say if the country would bar OLAF from policing the UK’s customs system under the “new customs partnership” model or whether it would allow the Commission to make demands for recovery of lost duties.

“The exact form of the arrangements will be agreed as part of the negotiations,” a ministry spokeswoman said.

MONEY AND EFFORT

Lode Van Den Hende, a partner with Herbert Smith Freehills in Brussels, said it was hard to see how the customs partnership model could work without OLAF or a similar body policing the UK’s monitoring of imports destined for the EU. “In practical terms they (Britain and the EU) would have to operate in the same way or the whole thing would fall apart,” he said.

Bernard Jenkin, a member of parliament for May’s Conservative party, who backed Brexit in last year’s referendum, said he opposed continued EU oversight of UK borders. “There is no need for an EU institution to police our customs, and we should not accept this,” he said in a statement.

“Any dispute about each other’s customs arrangements should be settled by an independent arbitrator, as with any other international agreement, not by an institution which belongs only to one party of the agreement,” he added. Van Den Hende said the ECJ may not accept the creation of an independent body to oversea EU customs. Customs are a matter of EU law and the court is supposed to be the highest authority on this.

Also, the breadth of areas in which the UK wishes to retain free trade with Europe means many such independent arbitrators would be required. They would be needed to monitor enforcement of health standards, standards in financial services and rules that apply to a host of other regulated markets. “In theory you can design that, but in practice neither the UK nor the EU would want that because you would be replicating institutions which already exist. It would be a huge amount of money and effort,” he said.

“This is in one of the fundamental problems about Brexit. The UK wants to retain deep integration but the UK doesn’t like the institutions that administer all this stuff,” Van Den Hende said.

Long weekend getaways for 2017: Where are you going for Ganesh Chaturthi?,"Everyone needs a holiday, so why not plan ahead for yours. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Everyone needs a holiday, so why not plan ahead for yours. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Did you spend most of last year grumbling about how you didn’t get to travel much; how work pressure was too much and there wasn’t any time to take a break? Well then, let that not be an excuse for 2017, because this year has a whole host of long weekends (some you may need to work around, but then what are casual leaves and sick leaves for?) for you to make good use of. So far we’ve identified 14 of them, of which two (in August and October) can give you nine full days of vacation fun if only strategically add a couple of extra days.

We took inspiration from our own travels, added inputs from travel experts from Cleartrip, TravelTriangle, Travkart, Expedia, Skyscanner, etc., to come up with this. Check them out.

Hit the beach by going to Goa or Diu. The weather is perfect for water sports and fun. Love the snow? Then trek up to Auli or Parashar Lake for the weekend. You can even head to Dubai to catch the fag end of the Dubai shopping festival.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to Goa for Mardi Gras, or towards Shimla and Fagu for a relaxing weekend in the hills.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to the hills for some chill time, and to catch a bit of snow if you’re lucky. Options could include Shimla’s outskirts or McLeodganj to the north, a hilly trek towards Malshej to the west, or even Puri or Digha in the east.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: 1/2

Where to go: Head to Singapore for some weekend fun. There is much to do and see, and the destination can be covered fairly well over four days.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: 1

Where to go: If you’re health conscious and a tad bit religious, then you could head towards Rishikesh for a Yoga retreat during this weekend. Or attend the Aoleang festival, held during the first week of April, along with the Konyak tribe in Nagaland.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you like nature and a bit of hiking, then head towards McLeodganj or a bit higher up towards Triund. It’s an easy hike for those who have never trekked before and gives you the most stunning views.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to Orchha for a quick weekend trip, or Pondicherry or Coorg if you’re in southern India. This a good time to head to these places before summer comes by in full swing.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to places that are known for their non-vegetarian and Mughlai fare, such as Hyderabad, Lucknow and Ajmer.

Total days: 9

Extra leaves: 2/3

Where to go: If you take just two leaves, you have nine full days for a mini vacation, and the weather is perfect for a sojourn to Europe. Head to Eastern European countries such as Greece, Croatia, Hungary and Poland. There’s a lot to cover, and it works well for the budget traveller as well.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you plan really tight, this is the season to head to the Valley of flowers in Uttarakhand for a mini trek, and you can also go up to the Hemkund Sahib gurudwara, which is the highest gurudwara in the world.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you’re really fond of beer, then a quick visit to Munich for the Oktoberfest (on till October 3) may not be a bad idea. This is also a bucket list item for many, so why not! If you’re around Mumbai, then Karjat may be a viable option or if you want to head towards the North East then Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh is a great option. Though the music festival happens in September, you can always find local pubs with live music and there are, of course, some picturesque hiking trails.

Total days: 9

Extra leaves: 4

Where to go: Nine days is like a mini vacation, so make full use of it. October is a good month for a Vietnam-Cambodia trip, or just one of these countries, if you don’t want to rush it. Eastern Europe is also a good bet since it would be just before the severe winter sets in. In India, a trek through Spiti valley would give you stunning vistas to gorge upon, or if you haven’t been to Rajasthan yet, then a road trip is highly recommended.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Dhanaulti, Ranikhet, Mukteshwar, Manali, Binsar and Chakrata are all hill stations that would not only be a refreshing change, but also give stunning views of the snow-capped Himalayas. In southern India, Pondicherry or Kovalam are lovely seaside destinations worth considering.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Let’s face it, Goa is an obvious choice for this three-day weekend, and that’s for a reason. But if you’d rather not hit the crowded streets and beaches, and love snow then Manali and Rohtang Pass could be good options, even Auli is covered in white at this time of the year.

Donald Trump’s evangelical advisers sticking with him amid fallout,"The president initially responded by blaming “many sides” for the violence. (File Photo) The president initially responded by blaming “many sides” for the violence. (File Photo)

One of President Donald Trump’s most steadfast constituencies has been standing by him amid his defense of a white nationalist rally in Virginia, even as business leaders, artists and Republicans turn away. Only one of Trump’s evangelical advisers has quit the role, while presidential boards in other fields saw multiple defections before being dismantled. The Rev. A.R. Bernard, pastor of the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn and one of the most influential clergymen in New York, announced his decision Friday night, saying “there was a deepening conflict in values between myself and the administration.”

Trump’s evangelical advisers have strongly condemned the bigotry behind the Charlottesville march by white nationalists and neo-Nazis over the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. But regarding Trump, they have offered either praise for his response or gentle critiques couched within complaints about how he has been treated by his critics and the media. Like other presidents before him, Trump has turned to religious leaders for counsel and support. His faith advisers include pastors who had worked with his campaign, and now pray with him and consult with his staff on issues ranging from religious liberty in the U.S. to the persecution of Christian minority populations in the Middle East. Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, and an early backer of Trump, said the president had made a “bold truthful statement” about the demonstration. Falwell said the president’s remarks were a clear repudiation of white supremacists, Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan.

Johnnie Moore, a public relations executive, faith adviser to the president and a spokesman for several other such evangelicals advisers, said, “The president is certainly guilty of being insensitive,” but that the media and critics of the president have ignored his other comments rejecting white supremacy and anti-Semitism. Jack Graham, a Texas pastor and former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, signaled he planned to stay on as an adviser. The role, Graham tweeted, “is to prayerfully advise & advance Christian issues to the Administration.” After the march last Saturday, in which neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and others scuffled with counter-protesters, a car driven by an alleged white nationalist plowed into a group of people, killing Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others.

The president initially responded by blaming “many sides” for the violence. On Monday, he read a prepared statement denouncing bigotry. But in a combative news conference Tuesday, he said “there is blame on both sides” and “there were very fine people on both sides.” Later, he doubled down, calling efforts to remove monuments to the Confederacy an attack on America’s “history and culture.” Some of his Republican allies started to more openly complain. Trump dissolved two business councils this week after members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office. On Friday, the entire membership of the President’s Committee On the Arts and Humanities resigned. As the backlash built, evangelical author Michael Brown, who attended a recent Washington meeting of Christian leaders and White House aides, urged Trump to fulfill his campaign promise to be a “unifier.” In Brown’s post Thursday on stream.org, he showered the president with praise, calling Trump “tenacious” and “fearless,” and saying, “You will never satisfy the secular media.” But Brown said, “there are times to be a wrecking ball and times to be a statesman. Today, our nation needs you to be a statesman. Will you rise to the occasion?”

Trump won 80 percent of the white evangelical vote and has earned some of his highest approval ratings from the group throughout his tumultuous presidency. Evangelicals have been thrilled by his appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court and by the president’s pledge to strengthen religious liberty protections. Conservative Christians who have long worked with political leaders say they have never before had such access to the White House. At the same time, many of his evangelical advisers have been working to confront racism within their denominations. White evangelical support for Trump, and the response of evangelical leaders amid the fallout from the rally, has widened rifts between black and white Christians. South Carolina pastor Mark Burns, one of Trump’s most vocal Christian defenders, posted a video on the day of the march distancing Trump from the white supremacists who said they were rallying in the president’s name. “David Duke and his Neo-Nazi Hate Groups don’t represent us Americans that elected” Trump, Burns tweeted. He later criticized the media focus on the rally and said they should be looking instead at the murder rate in Chicago.

Special eclipse glasses selling out quickly,"Utah residents flock to the planetarium in Salt Lake City, Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017, to buy eclipse glasses to make sure they get ones that aren’t faulty following a recall issued by online retailer Amazon. The Clark Planetarium has seen a huge spike in sales this week of the facility’s glasses after the John A. Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah on Sunday, Aug. 13, told people to throw out the glasses the centre gave away this month because of the recall, said Rob Morris, director of operations. People could keep ones with a Clark Planetarium label, the centre said.

Eclipse mania is building and so is demand for the glasses that make it safe to view the first total solar eclipse to cross the US in 99 years. Lines are forming, prices are rising and shelves are emptying as people scurry to obtain special eyewear to view the sun Monday as it is obscured by the passing moon. Complicating the rising demand from last-minute shoppers was a recent recall by Amazon that forced libraries and health centers around the country to recall glasses they gave away or sold.

For stores that still have the glasses, prices are spiking. The ones still for sale on Amazon were going for steep prices Friday, around $11 $12 each.

Nancy West, a 67-year-old retired nurse from Utah, was delighted to be among the final people to get glasses Thursday before the Clark Planetarium in Salt Lake City ran out. It sold nearly 90,000 pairs at $2 each this week. “I will never see a total eclipse again because I will not live long enough,” West said. “It’s an opportunity to understand how our universe works and what part I play in that.”

Amy Watts and her 13-year-old son, Ethan, waited in line for an hour at the planetarium so they could have a safe way to watch the historic moment. “We heard the frenzy of getting ahold of some eclipse glasses so we thought, ‘What the heck, we’ll give it a shot,'” said Watts, a health coach. “We actually scored some.”

Doctors around the US launched campaigns this summer to warn people that they can damage their eyes staring directly at the sun, even the slimmest sliver of it. They advised people to get special eclipseglasses. The American Astronomical Society put out a list of 15 approved manufacturers.

Doctors say people who don’t have the glasses can look indirectly with a pinhole projector — which can be made from a shoebox — that casts images of the eclipsed sun onto a screen at least 3 feet away. NASA also has a webpage listing safety tips for how to view the eclipse. One of the approved manufacturers selling the special glasses, American Paper Optics, has sold 45 million pairs over the last two years — 10 million since mid-July, said John Jerit, president of the Memphis, Tennessee-based company.

Among their customers was Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which had to recall 8,000 glasses purchased from an unidentified third-party vendor and given out at a county fair last weekend. The center was offering people the chance to exchange the faulty glasses for new, certified ones from American Paper Optics Friday through Monday.

The scramble was on even for those not affected by recalls. The Boise Public Library started giving out free eclipse glasses August 1. With lines of eager eclipse-watchers stretching out the door, the main branch ran out in about 15 minutes, spokesman Kevin Winslow said.

The rest of the Boise library branches also ran out quickly: the entire supply of more than 2,000 glasses was gone in under an hour. “We got about a dozen calls in the last hour asking if we still had them,” Winslow said Thursday. “I’m telling people, ‘If you have a family of three or four, not everyone has to have their own pair — you can pass it around.'”

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warns German foreign minister to ‘know your limits’,"“He knows no limits! Who are you to talk to the president of Turkey? Know your limits. He is trying to teach us a lesson… How long have you been in politics? How old are you?” Erdogan said in a bitter personal attack on Gabriel. (AP/File) “He knows no limits! Who are you to talk to the president of Turkey? Know your limits. He is trying to teach us a lesson… How long have you been in politics? How old are you?” Erdogan said in a bitter personal attack on Gabriel. (AP/File)

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on told German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel to “know your limits” after he vehemently criticised the Turkish leader for interfering in Germany’s upcoming elections.

“He knows no limits! Who are you to talk to the president of Turkey? Know your limits. He is trying to teach us a lesson… How long have you been in politics? How old are you?” Erdogan said in a bitter personal attack on Gabriel.

Erdogan had a day earlier caused consternation in Berlin by urging ethnic Turks in Germany to vote against both parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition in the September 24 legislative elections.

Gabriel condemned Erdogan’s comments as an “unprecedented act of interference” in Germany’s sovereignty. “Of course they got uncomfortable. They all started jumping up and down,” remarked Erdogan in a speech to supporters in the southwestern province of Denizli.

Erdogan repeated his controversial call to ethnic Turks eligible to vote in the German elections not to cast their ballots for Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), their coalition partner the Social Democratic Party (SPD) or the Greens.

“Teach them (the three parties) a lesson in the German elections. They are waging a campaign against Turkey. Vote for those who don’t have enmity towards Turkey.” He added: “It’s not important for us whether Germany opens its doors to us or not. We have enough doors.

“We will go to countries that have opened their doors and we will open our doors to them,” said Erdogan. Analysts estimate that some 1.2 million people of Turkish origin will have the right to vote in the September polls as German citizens.

"Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan condemn child abuse, share video with strong message","Shikhar Dhawan and Robin Uthappa asked for parents to be more patient with their children and their learning. Shikhar Dhawan and Robin Uthappa asked for parents to be more patient with their children and their learning.

Shikhar Dhawan and Robin Uthappa have reacted strongly to a video doing the rounds on social media and on Whatsapp which shows a child trying to narrate the numbers and being beaten if making a mistake. Both cricketers have asked for parents to be patient with their children while maintaining that each child learns at his/her own pace.

India captain Virat Kohli also posted the video on his Instagram account and wrote, “The fact that the pain and anger of the child is ignored and ones own ego to make the child learn is so massive that compassion has totally gone out of the window. This is shocking and saddening to another dimension. A child can never learn if intimidated. This is hurtful.”

Dhawan wrote, “I request parents to be patient with ur kids at all times. Every child learns at his own pace. Pls refrain from beating/degrading them.” alongside the video. Uthappa tweeted, “This is heart wrenching. Children shouldn’t be raised this way. This needs to stop. I pray we can raise our kids with love instead of fear.”

Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh also questioned the way in imparting education. “Is that how you going to bring up your child ? Absolutely disgraceful and disturbing behaviour by this parent 😡 you need to give your child love and compassion to get the best out of them ! Unacceptable 😤” wrote Yuvraj while Kohli wrote, “The fact that the pain and anger of the child is ignored and ones own ego to make the child learn is so massive that compassion has totally gone out of the window. This is shocking and saddening to another dimension. A child can never learn if intimidated. This is hurtful.”.

The video shows a little girl repeating numbers 1 to 5 which are written on a notebook while making numerous revisions. The girl pleads to be given a break while claiming she is having a headache and in tears but the women in the video, possibly the parent, continues to get the child to repeat the counting. In the end, the child gets frustrated and tears up even further. The video has been going viral on Whatsapp and getting plenty of attention.

US President Donald Trump fires adviser Steve Bannon: Report,"Bannon damaged his standing by giving an interview to the liberal American Prospect this week in which he was seen to be undercutting Trump’s position on North Korea. (AP) Bannon damaged his standing by giving an interview to the liberal American Prospect this week in which he was seen to be undercutting Trump’s position on North Korea. (AP)

President Donald Trump has fired his chief strategist Steve Bannon, a person familiar with the decision told Reuters on Friday. A source close to Bannon said he was not expected to resign on his own. “Bannon is going to make them fire him,” the source said. “He’s not going to officially resign. He’s still been doing the work. He’s been working on projects.”

The New York Times, however, cited a person close to Bannon as saying he had submitted his resignation on August 7 and that it was to be announced this week, but had been delayed by the fallout from a rally by white nationalists in Virginia over the weekend.

Bannon damaged his standing by giving an interview to the liberal American Prospect this week in which he was seen to be undercutting Trump’s position on North Korea.

Bannon told associates he thought he was talking to an academic and thought he was off the record. He has told friends he could go back to the right-wing Breitbart News outlet if he were to leave the White House.

"Trump defends Confederate statues, berates his critics","In this Aug. 14, 2017, photo, President Donald Trump pauses while speaking in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) In this Aug. 14, 2017, photo, President Donald Trump pauses while speaking in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)

With prominent Republicans openly questioning his competence and moral leadership, President Donald Trump burrowed deeper into the racially charged debate over Confederate memorials and lashed out at members of his own party in the latest controversy to engulf his presidency. Out of sight, but still online, Trump tweeted his defense of monuments to Confederate icons — bemoaning rising efforts to remove them as an attack on America’s “history and culture.”

And he berated his critics who, with increasingly sharper language, have denounced his initially slow and then ultimately combative comments on the racial violence at a white supremacist rally last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump was much quicker Thursday to condemn violence in Barcelona, where more than a dozen people were killed when a van veered onto a sidewalk and sped down a busy pedestrian zone in what authorities called a terror attack.

He then added to his expression of support a tweet reviving a debunked legend about a US general subduing Muslim rebels a century ago in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pig blood.

“Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!” Trump wrote.

Trump’s unpredictable, defiant and, critics claim, racially provocative behavior has clearly begun to wear on his Republican allies — and also has upset the mother of the young woman killed in the Charlottesville violence. Friday morning on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Heather Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, said she initially missed the first few calls to her from the White House. But she said “now I will not” talk to the president after a news conference in which Trump equated violence by white supremacists at the rally with violence by those protesting the rally.

Heyer was killed when a driver rammed a car into a crowd of demonstrators protesting the white nationalists.

Trump found no comfort in his own party, either. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Trump considered for a Cabinet post, declared Thursday that “the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to” in dealing with crises. And Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska tweeted, “Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period.”

Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Trump’s “moral authority is compromised.”

Trump, who is known to try to change the focus of news coverage with an attention-grabbing declaration, sought to shift Thursday from the white supremacists to the future of statues.

“You can’t change history, but you can learn from it,” he tweeted. “Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson — who’s next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. …

“Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!”

“Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,” he tweeted.

Trump met separately Thursday at his golf club in nearby Bedminster with the administrator of the Small Business Administration and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter. Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Vice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting.

Though out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration. He dissolved two business councils Wednesday after the CEO members began quitting, damaging his central campaign promise to be a business-savvy chief executive in the Oval Office.

And the White House said Thursday that it was abandoning plans to form an infrastructure advisory council. Two major charities, the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society, announced they are canceling fundraisers scheduled for Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, Florida, amid the continuing backlash over Trump’s remarks.

And the CEO of 21st Century Fox, James Murdoch, has denounced racism and terrorists while expressing concern over Trump’s statements. Murdoch writes that the event in Charlottesville and Trump’s response is a concern for all people. “I can’t believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists.”

Murdoch is the son of the company’s co-executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch, a Trump confidant. Meanwhile, rumblings of discontent from Trump’s staff grew so loud that the White House had to release a statement saying that Trump’s chief economic adviser wasn’t quitting. And the president remained on the receiving end of bipartisan criticism for his handling of the aftermath of the Charlottesville clashes.

On Thursday, he hit back hard — against Republicans.

He accused “publicity-seeking” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina of falsely stating Trump’s position on the demonstrators. He called Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake “toxic” and praised Flake’s potential primary election opponent. Graham said Wednesday that Trump “took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency” between the marching white supremacists and the people who had been demonstrating against them. Flake has been increasingly critical of Trump in recent weeks.

Pressured by advisers, the president had softened his words on the dispute Monday, two days after he had enraged many by declining to single out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis whose demonstration against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statute had led to violence and the death of a counter-protester in Charlottesville.

He returned to his combative stance Tuesday — insisting anew during an unexpected and contentious news conference at Trump Tower that “both sides” were to blame. Aides watching from the sidelines reacted with dismay and disbelief and privately told colleagues they were upset by the president’s remarks, though not upset enough for anyone to resign.

The resignation speculation around Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council and a Jew, had grown so intense by Thursday that the White House released a statement saying reports that Cohn was stepping down were “100 percent false.”

But not all of Trump’s aides were unhappy with his performance. Adviser Steve Bannon’s job security in the White House has become tenuous — Trump offered only a “we’ll see” on Tuesday when asked if his chief strategist would remain in his post — but Bannon has been telling allies that the president’s news conference would electrify the GOP base.

And in a pair of interviews Wednesday, Bannon cheered on the president’s nationalist tendencies and suggested that a fight over Confederate monuments was a political fight he welcomes.

“The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it’s all racist,” Bannon told The New York Times. “Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can’t get enough of it.”

"Dabholkar murder case: Explain stand on Sanatan Sanstha and HJS, asks family","Dr Narendra Dabholkar. File Dr Narendra Dabholkar. File

FOUR years after the murder of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, the family of the slain activist on Saturday said it was still waiting for justice and wondering whether it will ever get justice. The family’s disbelief stems from the fact that the Maharashtra government, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, has “neither taken any drastic step nor shown any intention” to act tough against certain organisations which are “brazenly” targeting intellectuals and crusaders. Incidentally, former CM Prithviraj Chavan also made the same demand on Saturday, urging the state government and the CM to declare their intention vis-a-vis certain “dangerous organisations”.

A day before the anti-superstition activists across the country observe the fourth death anniversary — Dabholkar was killed on August 20, 2013 — of the rationalist by intensifying their “Jawab Do” agitation, Hamid Dabholkar, son of the activist, said: “We want to know the stand of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on organisations like the Sanatan Sanstha and the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS)? We want to know whether the CM and his government intend to ban organisations which are brazenly targeting intellectuals and crusaders for speaking out against wrong tendencies…,” he said.

Hamid said that the CM, other than speaking one line after his father’s murder, has preferred to remain silent. “And that’s why we are not sure what the government plans to do with such organisations. Will it allow them to operate as they are doing now or does the government have a plan to stop them in their tracks? The people of Maharashtra want to know the government’s intention. For too long, the government has maintained a silence on a very serious issue…we want to know why?” he asked.

On Saturday, the Maharashtra Congress also joined the Dabholkar family to once again raise the same demand. “We, too, have been demanding that the CM Devendra Fadnavis and his government should declare their intention about dangerous organisations operating in Maharashtra. In fact, I had raised this demand on the floor of the state Assembly, and also sought information under RTI to know the government’s move, if any, about such organisations. So far, they have drawn a blank. The CM and his government are refusing to break their silence,” said former CM Prithviraj Chavan.

Chavan reiterated that when he was the CM, his government had sent a 1,000-page dossier on banning organisations like Sanatan Sanstha. “Our officials had submitted a dossier to the me, expressing the pressing need to ban organisations like the Sanatan Sanstha. Our officials had told us that there were allegations that the organisation was involved in illegal and dangerous activities,” he alleged.

Chavan said the CM should at least tell the people whether his government was pursuing the issue of banning the organisation or has closed the file or whether the file was pending with the Union Government. “The state government has been mum so far. Despite the issue being such a serious one, the government does not seem to be serious and seems to be taking it lightly,” he said. Chavan said that his government had sent the dossier before the Sanatan Sanstha came under a cloud after the murder of two rationalists. “Which means there was pressing need to act more tough against the organisation,” he said. The Chief Minister’s Office said: “The CM has already clarified that no organisation will be banned just because someone is demanding… and no organisation will be spared if sufficient proofs are available to initiate action.”

Chavan said his government had provided additional proof after the Union Home Ministry demanded it. “After we sent the dossier, the Home Ministry had demanded additional proof and we had provided it,” he said. Sanatan Sanstha spokesperson Abhay Vartak said Sanatan was a spiritual organisation and all allegations against it are baseless.

"55-yr-old woman, daughter found dead inside Mahananda Express","Representational Image Representational Image

The bodies of a 55-year-old woman and her 30-year-old daughter — who went missing from Bulandshahr recently — were found in separate bogies of Mahananda Express stationed at Shahdara railway station, on Saturday, police said. Although police suspect suicide, officers admitted that robbery and murder could not be ruled out since their belongings were missing.

Police added that the victims’ family said that the two “suffered from depression” and that they had lodged a missing complaint in Bulandshahr on August 15. Parwaiz Ahmed, DCP (Railways), said that the family had been informed and that the postmortems were being conducted. He said, “We have also recorded the statement of the family members and started the probe accordingly.”

The bodies were discovered in S3 coach of the train by an Railway Protection Force (RPF) officer while patrolling the shunting area for the trains on Saturday. “The body of the elderly woman was found lying prone on the seat while her daughter’s body was in the next compartment,” said police, adding that prima facie investigation pointed to poisoning, since one of the victims had “froth coming out of her mouth”. Police are yet to rule out the possibility of them being drugged to facilitate theft and are also investigating how the two reached the shunting area.

It confirms use of sarin in the Aug. 21 attack in the Damascus suburb Ghouta that killed hundreds.

2014 – OPCW Declaration Assessment Team begins work to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in Syria’s declaration to the OPCW, which was supposed to include all aspects of its chemical weapons programme. By July 2016, after visiting Syria 18 times to inspect sites and meet with Syrian officials, it can “not fully verify that Syria had submitted a declaration that could be considered accurate and complete.”

– OPCW establishes a Fact Finding Mission in response to persistent allegations of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, “to establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic.” The Fact Finding Mission concludes the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread. It is not tasked with assigning blame.

2015 – United Nations-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism in Syria is established to identify individuals or entities behind chemical weapons attacks.

2016 – Joint Investigative Mechanism concludes that Syrian government forces used chlorine as a chemical weapon in three cases and that Islamic State militants used sulphur mustard.

– OPCW executive council adopts decision condemning Syrian government and Islamic State for chemical weapons use after a vote that split the body and signaled an end to U.S.-Russia cooperation.

2017 – OPCW Fact Finding Mission concludes that sarin was used in an April 4 attack in the Khan Sheikhoun area of northern Syria, the most deadly use of the nerve agent in three years. It does not assign blame. (Editing by Janet McBride and Richard Woods)

"NPA Resolution: Insolvency to save biz, not to liquidate them, says Arun Jaitley","(From left) Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and RBI Governor Urjit Patel during a conference on ‘Insolvency and Bankruptcy: Changing Paradigm’ in Mumbai on Saturday. Nirmal Harindran (From left) Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and RBI Governor Urjit Patel during a conference on ‘Insolvency and Bankruptcy: Changing Paradigm’ in Mumbai on Saturday. Nirmal Harindran

Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said that the key objective of the non-performing assets (NPA) resolution is not liquidation of businesses but to save them. He also said that the old regime of lenders chasing borrowers and being unable to recover anything is over.

Jaitley, who was speaking at an insolvency summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in Mumbai said that the new insolvency and bankruptcy law has significantly reversed defaulting debtor-creditor relationship.

“The ultimate objective really is not liquidation of assets, (but) to save these businesses, get either the existing promoters with or without new partners or new entrepreneurs to come in and make sure that these valuable assets are preserved,” said Jaitley.

Jaitley said the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was needed, as the Debt Recovery Tribunals failed to effectively perform their duty after the initial success.

“We lived in a system for many years which protected debtors and allowed assets to rust away. The old regime by which the creditor would get tired chasing the debtor and end up recovering nothing, is now over. If a debtor has to survive, he will have to service his debt, or he will have to make way for somebody else. I think this is the only correct way by which businesses would now be done and this message has to go loud and clear,” said Jaitley.

Calling for speedy and time-bound resolution of the bad loans issue, Jaitley hoped that the mandated timelines will be adhered to for the effective implementation of the IBC.

“The legislation has strict timelines and it is important to adhere these timelines. Conventionally, Indian courts have two standards. When timelines are laid for executives, they normally maintain these are binding. When timelines are meant for judicial institutions, courts have conventionally held that these are only directory,” said Jaitley.

Gross NPAs have crossed 9.6 per cent as of March 2017, while the stressed loans ratio is over 12 per cent. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has named 12 of the largest defaulters in June, which together owe more than Rs 2.5 lakh crore to banks. At least 11 of them are facing bankruptcy proceedings at the National Company Law Tribunal now.

Jaitley said that the powers of the resolution professionals will have to be clearly defined by the tribunals to “ensure that the assets of the stressed companies are preserved” and “the effective functioning of a company does not come to a standstill”.

‘Delhi is no longer about any one kind of food’: Sadia Dehlvi,"“My earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta,” Sadia Dehlvi says. “My earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta,” Sadia Dehlvi says.

Through the streets of Shahajahanabad, into the kitchen of some of the oldest families of Delhi, Sadia Dehlvi looks at the shape-shifter of a city that Delhi has come to be in her recent book Jasmine and Jinns. She talks of growing up in an extended Dilli family that lived in Shama Kothi on Sardar Patel Marg, the changes in the city’s palate over the years and giving Delhi one of its culinary stars – Al Kauser. Excerpts:

In the book, you trace your childhood through seasons and recipes telling us about a Delhi that once was. How did you narrow down on the idea?

Delhi has distinct seasons, and once upon a time lifestyles revolved around the weather. I would hear stories of how shopkeepers pulled down their shutters when the first rains arrived and went to Mehrauli for picnics with their families. Special dishes were made in the monsoon like Harimirch Qeema, Besani Roti and fresh Mango Chutney. Nihari was always associated with winter, and was eaten nihar muh, that is on an empty stomach. In winters, at home, every Sunday was ‘nihari day.’ We had it as early breakfast. Now people eat nihari all through the year and usually for lunch or dinner. It was traditionally referred to as gharib aadmi ka khana, and never served at weddings. Now nihari is a part of festive cuisine, even for us Dilliwalas.

In the summer, very little spice was used and I remember a variety of sherbets being made at home. These were mixed with barley water to keep us hydrated. Special chutneys were made with raw mango to save us from the severe heat. People in Delhi are exceedingly particular about taseer — inherent food properties and their effects on the body. I grew up relating to food in terms of halka (light), bhaari (heavy), garam (warm), or thanda (cold). Spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and peppercorns are believed to have garam taseer, and dishes which have these as ingredients are cooked mostly in winter. There is a hidden wisdom in such beliefs.

What are your first and most enduring memories of food?

My earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta. In those days, ready to use spices were not used in most homes. When large parties were held at home, I recall professional cooks coming to the house, cooking in deghs with the meat and spices provided to them. Tandoors were dug in the house for fresh rotis. There was a separate area in the house of kuchi mitti for this kind of cooking. My grandfather was a gracious host, and Shama Kothi acquired the reputation of serving the city’s finest cuisine.

How did you choose the recipes for the book?

Most of these dishes are cooked in my home and in the kitchens of most Dilliwalas. Except for recipes of a few specialties cooked on festivals and weddings, the rest of the dishes are really a part of our day to day cooking. One does not require some exotic spices to make them. And since our food is dominated by seasons, that’s how I have divided the food sections. We usually cook almost all seasonal vegetables with meat. It’s not just a good way to balance the intake of meat and vegetables, but also to create a variety of wonderful dishes.

Shami Kebabs Shami Kebabs

You mention how Delhi’s palate changed with the arrival of the Mughals and then with the British. What are the changes you notice in Delhi’s food culture today?

The Mughal cuisine, that is Indo Persian, is probably the cuisine that best defines Delhi’s traditional non-vegetarian cuisine. Chillies were added to Delhi food in the 18th century on the advise of the city’s hakims after the water in the canal that ran through Chandni Chowk got polluted. It was a way to purge toxins from the body. This is what led to the creation of Delhi’s popular chaat. Delhi’s cuisine once comprised Jain, Bania and Muslim food. Then the British influenced the eating habits of the elite. More changes came after Partition, with the arrival of the Punjabis. Tandoori chicken, butter chicken, choley bhaturey and dal makhani, came to typify Delhi food. But even that has changed, Delhi is no longer about any one kind of food. People from all over the country have made Delhi their home. So it’s now as much about dosa, momos, noodles as it is about biryani and qorma.

In the book, you mention how your mother wasn’t interested in kitchen chores. How do you think women’s relationship with food has changed?

My mother resented kitchen chores, because in those days women’s lives seemed to revolve around cooking. She rebelled against that idea and, luckily, she never really had to cook. She did other things and didn’t encourage me to cook either. Even now, she can’t understand my obsession with cooking. She tells me not to waste too much time in the kitchen. With so many women working, I think now cooking is not really looked at in a regressive way. Young working couples seem to order in or eat out so often. More and more young people are into health, and one has to cook right to eat right. With the internet, world cuisine has opened up and I meet so many young women who are experimenting with cooking various types of food. If you don’t look at cooking as a boring chore, it can be so much fun.

Family recipes were not shared earlier. But you believe in sharing them.

In older days, women or professional cooks never shared recipes. If they did, they would leave out a main ingredient so one could never get it right. I share family recipes because it gladdens my heart that they’ll bring cheer to people’s tables. Many of these have never travelled out of traditional Dilli homes. When friends come home for meals, they are surprised at the unusual combinations such as karela qeema, gajar salan, chuqandar gosht, bhindi salan that are regular fare for us.

How did Al Kauser come about?

I began Al Kauser with my mother in 1979. It was a small kiosk just opposite our house. After having lived a year in New York, I was very taken with the idea of street food. In those days, Delhi just had five star hotels and a few good restaurants, mostly in Connaught Place. Other than these, one had to go to old Delhi to eat kebabs. Al Kauser was the first road side kebab shop in New Delhi. It became quite a rage in the ’80s and ’90s. The kitchen was in our house. Entertaining in those years became so easy, as I could literally order a plate of kebab from my room. Now, street food is so much a part of Delhi culture.

Tell us the story behind the book’s title and the cover design.

Jasmine is the fragrance from my childhood. It was my grandmother’s favourite flower. We had jasmine shrubs in our gardens and I would help amma pluck them. In the summer, when we slept on the terrace, these were put on the charpais of the elders. The girls of the house were not allowed to wear jasmine flowers because amma said that jinns were attracted to young girls who wore jasmine. I also believe we had jinns that lived with us. In the evening, just before sunset, we had to stop playing in the gardens as amma said it was the time jinns ventured out. Throughout the 50 years we lived at Shama Kothi, we heard strange noises every night. So I guess my childhood was about Jasmine and Jinns. The cover idea by Shaaz Ahmed is old style story telling, with various elements from my childhood.

At least 27 Indians, including five women, have been arrested for overstaying their tourist visas in Sri Lanka, immigration officials said on Sunday. The immigration department’s investigation unit had been on the lookout for visa overstayers in the Northern Province, they said.

Most of the 27 Indian nationals were arrested in Jaffna, the provincial capital where ethnic Tamils form a majority of the population. They were arrested while they indulged in business activities in violation of the conditions of their tourist visas, the officials said, adding that they will be deported soon.

Security ramped up for Barcelona’s emotive La Liga opener,"Catalonia’s regional police force confirmed there would be additional officers on duty outside the Camp Nou. (Source: Reuters) Catalonia’s regional police force confirmed there would be additional officers on duty outside the Camp Nou. (Source: Reuters)

A huge security presence today will oversee Barcelona’s first match since two terror attacks in Catalonia killed 14 people and left 120 more injured.

Barca host Real Betis (1815GMT kick-off) at the club’s 99,000 capacity Camp Nou to open their La Liga campaign with the country still reeling from the most deadly attack on Spanish soil in 13 years.

A manhunt continues for a Moroccan national suspected to have been the driver of a van that ploughed into crowds on Barcelona’s Las Ramblas, killing 13, on Thursday.

Hours later attackers struck again in Cambrils, 120 kilometres south of Barcelona, where a car rammed into pedestrians, killing one person.

Catalonia’s regional police force confirmed there would be additional officers on duty outside the Camp Nou, but encouraged supporters to attend ‘calmly’.

“The recommendation is to go calmly, to be able to enjoy a game of football and that people can go reassured because the security presence is adequate for the number of people attending,” said Albert Oliva, a spokesman for the Mossos d’Esquadra.

Just over 50 miles northeast of Barcelona, concrete road blocks were mounted outside Girona’s Estadi Montilivi as their first ever La Liga match against Atletico Madrid passed off safely in front of a near capacity 13,500 crowd.

“They are extraordinary and lamentable circumstances,” said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde on Saturday. However, Valverde hoped fans wouldn’t be dissuaded by security fears and show the same spirit as huge crowds that gathered in the city’s central Plaza de Catalunya on Friday to chants of “not afraid”.

“We are calm. Moreover, we support the reaction of the people yesterday in Plaza Catalunya that ‘we are not afraid’,” added Valverde.

“We have to stand up to these circumstances and the best way is by moving forward.

“We know the way the world is, we are all potentially victims at any given moment, be it going to the metro station or going to a football ground. But it is something you can’t control and we can’t hide.”

Maximum security

With the peak summer tourism season still in full swing and thousands of tourists expected to attend for the chance to see five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi, Barca said the “maximum possible” security measures would be put in place to reassure fans.

“Given the increase in situations of danger, terrorism, the club have already taken measures to reinforce security,” said a Barcelona club spokesperson.

“The rule is to apply the maximum possible measures, and in extraordinary situations like this, apply them much more strictly.”

A minute’s silence will be held before all games in Spain’s first and second divisions this weekend.

Barcelona players will also wear black armbands and shirts with ‘Barcelona’ replacing individual names on the back. Former Barca defender Marc Bartra, himself the victim of a terrorist attack when a bomb hit the Borussia Dortmund team bus in April, paid his respects by kissing his black armband after scoring in Dortmund’s 3-0 win at Wolfsburg in the German league on Saturday.

On the field, Barca have had a dreadful start to the season as shorn of Neymar following his world record 222 million euro ($261 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain, the Catalans were swept aside 5-1 on aggregate by Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup.

Yet, Valverde conceded events over the past few days had put his professional problems into perspective. “It is our job and we know tomorrow we have an important game, but it is a different day for everyone.

“It makes you reflect at times when you have problems that everything is relative. It puts things in their place and that there are far more important things than small problems.”

In the flaky firmament of “bestsellers” and “pacy reads”, John Grisham has arguably been as steady as the northern star, when it comes to legal thrillers. Now he’s back with Camino Island, his latest. But get this: Camino Island’s intrigue unspools in a Florida beach town and the core premise revolves around rare books.

A departure from the usual lawyer-setting, Grisham’s book remains taut as ever right from the get-go: the story starts with an incredible heist at Princeton University’s Firestone Library — original manuscripts of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s works such as The Great Gatsby and Tender Is the Night are stolen.The FBI gets on board. A security firm, working for Princeton’s insurance company, thinks it has a lead in an obvious target: an eminent bookstore owner named Bruce Cable with a shady history and a penchant for philandering like his life depended on it.

"‘Iran’s top priority to protect nuclear deal from United States’, says President Hassan Rouhani","“Standing up for the JCPOA means standing up to Iran’s enemies,” he said on the last day of debates over his cabinet selections.

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday, the top foreign policy priority for his new government was to protect the nuclear deal from being torn up by the United States. “The most important job of our foreign minister is first to stand behind the JCPOA, and not to allow the US and other enemies to succeed,” Rouhani told parliament, using the technical name for the 2015 deal that eased sanctions in exchange for curbs to Iran’s nuclear programme.

“Standing up for the JCPOA means standing up to Iran’s enemies,” he said on the last day of debates over his cabinet selections. Rouhani indicated a week ago that Iran was ready to walk out on the nuclear deal if the United States continued to apply fresh sanctions.

It has come under mounting pressure after Tehran carried out missile tests and Washington imposed new sanctions — with each accusing the other of violating the spirit of the agreement. But Rouhani has insisted the deal remains the preferred way forward, not least to help rebuild Iran’s struggling economy and create jobs.

“The second responsibility of the foreign ministry… is to get involved in economic activities. It should help attract foreign investment and technology,” Rouhani said. He was addressing lawmakers ahead of votes of confidence on his ministerial choices.

Rouhani, a political moderate, began his second term earlier this month after winning a resounding victory over a hardline challenger in May. He has vowed to continue his outreach to the world, and to improve civil liberties at home, but has been criticised by reformists for again failing to select a single female minister.

"Security in spotlight in Spain as La Liga, Vuelta get under way","Authorities in Spain — a country obsessed with football — have decided to go ahead with sporting events despite security fears. (Source: AP) Authorities in Spain — a country obsessed with football — have decided to go ahead with sporting events despite security fears. (Source: AP)

While Spain mourns following the terror attacks in Catalonia, security will be in the spotlight as two global sporting events get under way this weekend in La Liga and the Vuelta cycling race.

After a three-month summer break, La Liga returns with 10 matches over the weekend, including three on Saturday, among them Atletico Madrid’s trip to newly-promoted Catalan outfit Girona.

Thousands of police officers and security personnel will be mobilised in and around Spanish stadiums. The Vuelta, one of cycling’s three Grand Tours, begins in the French city of Nimes on Saturday but the three-week race enters Spain on Tuesday with a stage finishing in Tarragona.

Thousands of spectators will line the route. Tarragona is only 20 kilometres along the Mediterranean coast from Cambrils, where a car rammed into pedestrians, injuring six civilians and a police officer early on Friday morning. One of the civilians later died.

That incident came just hours after the attack in Barcelona, when a white van sped down the popular Las Ramblas avenue, packed full of tourists on Thursday afternoon, knocking people down and killing 13.

Authorities in Spain — a country obsessed with football — have decided to go ahead with sporting events despite security fears. The LFP, the body that runs La Liga, confirmed that top-flight matches, including Barcelona’s home meeting with Betis at the Camp Nou on Sunday, would go ahead.

A minute’s silence will be held before kick-offs around the country while Barcelona players will sport black armbands and players will wear shirts with ‘Barcelona’ replacing individual names on the back.

Maximum measures

“LaLiga…hopes that supporters will be able to enjoy matches normally on the opening matchday,” the league said in a mail sent to AFP.

Barcelona said that postponing Sunday’s game, due to kick off at 8:15pm (1815 GMT), had not been considered.

The club were waiting for instructions from authorities about any additional security measures that may be required at the Camp Nou, the biggest football ground in Europe with a capacity of 99,354.

“Given the increase in situations of danger, terrorism, the club have already taken measures to reinforce security,” said a club spokesperson.

“The rule is to apply the maximum possible measures, and in extraordinary situations like this, apply them much more strictly.” In Nimes the same level of vigilance was being used by organisers of the Vuelta. They said on Friday that they were working with authorities to assure the protection of fans and of the event itself.

The first two stages on Saturday and Sunday take place in southern France before Monday’s third stage in the Pyrenees concludes in Andorra. “Extraordinary measures” have been taken by the government of Andorra, with more agents mobilised and border controls reinforced in the tiny principality that borders France and Spain.

The Vuelta, like most cycling races, is by its very nature eminently complex in terms of security with potentially millions of spectators lining roads and large numbers of people gathering in towns where stages begin or end.

For riders, the scenes from Barcelona brought back memories of a similar attack in Nice which killed 86 people during last year’s Tour de France, casting a shadow over that race.

“Just horrific scenes reminiscent of what happened in Nice during the Tour last year. Of course our thoughts and best wishes are with all those affected in this attack,” said Britain’s Tour de France champion Chris Froome.

However, Froome and the rest of the peloton were refusing to let terrorism fears affect their build-up to the Vuelta. “It’s something you can spend a lot of time thinking about but it’s something that’s completely outside of your control, you just hope that you wouldn’t see anything like that personally,” Froome added.

"GJM chief Bimal Gurung, others booked after blast rips through Darjeeling","Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) chief Bimal Gurung Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) chief Bimal Gurung

A high-intensity blast shook Darjeeling’s Chowkbazar in the wee hours of Saturday, the first such incident since the indefinite shutdown to press for a separate state of Gorkhaland began in the Hills over two months ago. Following this, police booked Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) chief Bimal Gurung and several others under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for their alleged involvement in the blast.

This comes hours before one civic police personnel was killed after a grenade was hurled at the Kalimpong police station, Darjeeling Range IG Manoj Verma told PTI late Saturday.

In the Darjeeling blast, though no casualty was reported, police said several shops were destroyed due to the explosion that took place around 12.50 am in front of the old supermarket near Singamari Motor Syndicate in Chowkbazar.

“It was a high-intensity blast… parts of the explosives were found at a distance of 30 to 40 m from the blast spot. Glass windows of a nearby building were damaged. The target seems to have been the police personnel who were patrolling the area. Had this blast taken place during daytime, it would have led to several deaths,” Darjeeling SP Akhilesh Chaturvedi said.

“We have recovered some wires from the spot, which establishes that it was an IED explosion. Prima facie, we suspect that Gorkha leaders, namely Bimal Gurung, Prakash Gurung and Praveen Subba, were behind the explosion. They are basically trying to create panic among the people of Darjeeling,” he added.

A case has been initiated at Sadar police station against Bimal Gurung, Prakash Gurung, Praveen Subba and others under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging war), 121A (attempting to wage war), 122 (collecting arms) of the IPC, Explosive Substance Act, UAPA, West Bengal Maintenance of Public Order Act and Professional Diploma in Public Procurement Act, said Chaturvedi.

“A month ago, a large cache of gelatin sticks was stolen from a hydel power plant in the region… it is being probed if the same explosives were used in the explosion,” he added. A team from the state CID and forensic experts have examined the explosives, said police.

Meanwhile, demanding an NIA probe into the incident, GJM claimed the blast was planned and executed by those who are not in favour of Gorkhaland.

“GJM condemns and protests against the blast that took place in the heart of Darjeeling town. We believe it was the handiwork of those who do not want Gorkhaland state to be formed. This was a planned move aimed at bringing disrepute to the movement and the demand for Gorkhaland,” Bimal Gurung said in a statement.

“While the entire Darjeeling region has been fortified and turned into a garrison of sorts, it is beyond our understanding how a blast could take place in the heart of the city at night, that too around 200 m from the Darjeeling Sadar police station and around 100 m from the office of the deputy superintendent of police. We demand a probe at the earliest by a high-level committee comprising NIA officials under the supervision of the Supreme Court to ensure an unbiased investigation,” he added.

“We will never support any undemocratic means…we condemn the attempt at breaching peace in the Hills and request everyone not to be misled or scared,” the statement said.

Why are Confederate statues at the center of latest conflict in US?,"Charlottesville violence: A group of counter-protesters rally against members of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia. (Source: Reuters) Charlottesville violence: A group of counter-protesters rally against members of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia. (Source: Reuters)

Last week in Charlottesville, Virginia white supremacists descended onto the city to protest against the city’s plan to remove Confederate statues, namely pro-slavery Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s statue. After Charlottesville voted for the removal of the statue earlier this year, white nationalist leaders had protested against the decision multiple times. In May this year, white nationalist leader Richard Spencer had come to the statue with his supporters for a nighttime protest. Subsequently, in June, at least 50 members of a North Carolina-based Ku Klux Klan group travelled all the way to Charlottesville for a protest rally, where they were met with hundreds of counter-protesters.

The protests are different from previous ones in terms of its sheer scale and open display of Nazi propaganda. Nazi-era slogans like ‘blood and soil’, ‘You will not replace us’, ‘ Jew will not replace us’, echoed through the protest site by torch-wielding white nationalists. Meanwhile, the protests took a deadly turn when a 20-year-old man ploughed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters killing a 32-year-old woman and wounded several others.

Hours after the death, US President Donald Trump denounced the violence but stopped short of condemning the white nationalists and Nazi groups. Trump’s criticism of neo-Nazi groups came only two days later when he said, “Racism is evil. White supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.”

Responding to Charlottesville incident, Kentucky Mayor Jim Gray fast tracked his city’s plans to take down the Confederate monuments. Soon after, in North Carolina’s Durham, protesters also pulled down a statue dedicated to Confederate soldiers, followed by Baltimore’s decision to tear down its own Confederate monuments almost overnight this week.

Why is America suddenly so concerned about pulling down these statues?

The current protests go back to a mass shooting incident in 2015, involving a self-proclaimed white supremacist Dylann Roof who gunned down at least nine African-Americans in South Carolina’s Charleston. The incident drew a lot of eyeballs as Roof was displayed in pictures after the attack posing with the Confederate flag. This stoked a fight within South Carolina whether it should pull down a Confederate flag that had historically flown at the state capitol for years now. Eventually, the state officially took down the flag.

Ever since this incident came into the spotlight, many states, particularly in the South, have increasingly questioned their very own Confederate symbols. The core argument is this: Confederacy was essentially built upon the premise of preserving slavery and white supremacy in the United States of America. So this isn’t something the country needs to honour or commemorate in any possible way.

Critics of Confederate monuments opine that these statues are really not about commemorating pro-slavery movement but merely preserving Southern pride. They are going by the premise that if you take down these statues, you’re taking down a part of history with it. But historians believe that the documents from the time reveal that Confederacy was built upon maintaining slavery.

To add insult to the injury, US President Donald Trump controversially compared George Washington with Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson in one of his statements. “This week, it is Robert E. Lee and, this week, Stonewall Jackson. Is it George Washington next? You have to ask yourself, where does it stop?”

Here is where the entire discussion gets a little complicated, raising pertinent questions about the United States of America and its history. Historical evidence certainly suggests the answer is very clear: The Confederacy and the monuments dedicated to it always stood for white supremacy, although much of US is coming to terms with it.

India’s Akash Saharan finished a respectable sixth in the final round of the men’s trap event at the ISSF Junior Shotgun World Cup at Porpetto, Italy today.

Spain’s Adria Martinez won the gold with a world record score of 46 out of 50. Saharan made it to the six-man final round by finishing a commendable second out of 70 shooters. He had even got the better of Martinez in a three-way shoot-off to determine

qualifying positions for the final round.

In the final round, the Indian took an early joint-lead having shot four out of four, but then missed eight of the next 21 to settle for sixth place.

Martinez was involved in an intense battle for gold in the end with Italian Matteo Marongiu, who is a World Cup bronze medallist as well as a European Championship silver winner at the junior level, eventually prevailing 46-43.

Turkey’s Murat Ilbilgi won the bronze with a score of 36 in the finals. Saharan had earlier shot 114 out of 125 in the qualifying

round and had won a three-way shoot-off 11-10 to push the Italian Matteo Marongiu into the third qualifying spot. Martinez was first one out in the shoot-off.

"Bangladesh tour is an opportunity for us to change our record in subcontinent, says Steve Smith","Steve Smith will lead Australia against Bangladesh. (Source: AP) Steve Smith will lead Australia against Bangladesh. (Source: AP)

Australian skipper Steve Smith has said that upcoming tour to Bangladesh will serve as a platform to improve upon their Asian record and also get accustomed to sub-continental conditions.

Speaking to the media, Smith said, “I think it is going to be a great series. Bangladesh is very good here. I am not picking a favorite. We have to be confident in our skill set and hopefully, we can get our processes right and have a really good series. We’d certainly like to have done a lot better on the subcontinent that’s for sure,” Smith said. “Now it is an opportunity for us to change (our record).

Recalling their last tour to the sub-continent, he said, “I thought we did some things really well in India. We just needed to do it for a little bit longer, and consistently. This is another opportunity to showcase our skills, show what we learned over there and hopefully give our best foot forward.”

Meanwhile, Steve O’Keefe has failed to make the cut despite having a relatively good tour. Commenting on it, Smith said, “It is unlucky. He did very well in the first test match in India and had some contributions throughout in the other three test matches as well. We just see it as a bit of a time to get us someone new into the group,” Smith said.

“Ashton has been around the group for a quite a while now, he’s worked on his art and he’s becoming a lot more consistent in what he’s doing. It’d be fantastic to see him get an opportunity. It’s four years until we next go to India which is always a tough tour for us and one that I particularly as captain want to win (at some stage) throughout my tenure.

“It’s an opportunity for Ashton to get some experience in these conditions and hopefully improve, with an eye to the next time we go to India as well.”, he said.

"Lenovo K8 Note review: Nothing revolutionary, but this phone feels right","Lenovo K8 Note is now available on sale via Amazon, and here’s our full review of the smartphone. Lenovo K8 Note is now available on sale via Amazon, and here’s our full review of the smartphone.

Lenovo has been keeping a low profile when it comes to marketing its own smartphones. This in turn has lead many to assume that Lenovo will step back as the focus shifts back to Motorola. But it seems the Lenovo branded smartphones are not going anywhere. Rather than trying to do things differently, Lenovo seems more keen to strengthen its base and focus on core features; and the result is the K8 Note. Its new smartphone is a refined device, as it runs on stock version of Android; there are two cameras on the back as well.

Lenovo K8 Note specifications: 5.5-inch Full HD display| MediaTek Helio X23 (MT6797) | 3GB RAM + 32GB ROM and 4GB RAM + 64GB ROM| microSD card support (up to 128GB)|13MP main camera + 5MP secondary camera for depth-sensing camera | 13MP front camera |4000mAh battery | Android 7.1 Nougat

Lenovo K8 Note price in India: Rs 12,999 (3GB RAM +32GB storage, Rs 13,999 (4GB RAM +64GB storage)

Lenovo K8 Note Design, Display review

Design-wise, Lenovo K8 Note looks like an ordinary smartphone. It would not be wrong to say that the design of the phone is uninspiring. Sure, it has a metal unibody-clad design but it took me awhile to get attached to the K8 Note. Between Fine Gold and Venom Black, I preferred the latter. The metal chassis feels solid, and the use of 2.5D Gorilla Glass on the front should offer reasonable protection from minor cuts and scratches. Thankfully, Lenovo has supplied a plastic cover inside the box for added protection.

Design-wise, Lenovo K8 Note looks like an ordinary smartphone. Design-wise, Lenovo K8 Note looks like an ordinary smartphone.

My issue with the Lenovo K8 Note’s design is not that it doesn’t look original, but that it sports a thick bezel that makes typing with one hand hard for most people. Lenovo has opted for a fingerprint scanner on the back which I have always found more logical. The fingerprint scanner on the K8 Note was largely fine during my testing. Like any modern day smartphone, Lenovo K8 Note has a microSD card slot, which will lets users add a further 128GB of storage.

The phone has separate slots for your microSD card and two SIM cards. Lenovo also throws a dedicated music key on the right side of the phone, which can be used used to control music playback. But the same can be configured to control the camera, open the flashlight, take a screenshot for that matter, or open any other app you use frequently.

Lenovo has loaded the K8 Note with a 5.5-inch display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Lenovo has loaded the K8 Note with a 5.5-inch display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.

Lenovo also claims that the K8 Note has a water repellent coating, meaning the phone can survive a splash of water, or unexpected showers. Just keep in mind that Lenovo designed this feature to protect the phone from light splashes of water. Don’t even try the K8 Note to dunk it into a swimming pool, or spill a mug of water. It may damage the phone permanently.

Lenovo has loaded the K8 Note with a 5.5-inch display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. You don’t get pure blacks like you’d get on an AMOLED display, but the K8 Note still offers solid contrast. The display is mostly bright, with excellent viewing angles. All in all, the K8 Note’s screen is pretty good.

Lenovo K8 Note Performance review

By and large, Lenovo K8 Note is a mid-end smartphone. But I’m happy to report that when you combine a deca-core MediaTek Helio X23 (MT6797) processor with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, you get a decent performance on a smartphone priced under Rs 15,000. In my regular usage I didn’t have any problems with the K8 Note’s performance. Apps loaded within seconds and the phone seemed fluid even when you open multiple browser tabs at once.

Playing demanding games like Asphalt 8: Airborne and Batman – The Telltale Series, the phone took more time to load. The games when loaded did run smoothly, but the phone became noticeably hot during long gaming sessions, but this is expected. Lenovo K8 Note offers reasonably loud listening experience, in spite of having only has a mono speaker. But there’s one big downer: Lenovo K8 Note ships without a pair of bundled earphones. Call quality is solid, though.

Lenovo K8 Note Software review

Lenovo K8 Note comes with Google’s Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box. I’m happy to see that Lenovo has finally ditched its aged Vibe Pure UI to streamline the experience on the phone. It was a menace, and thankfully the K8 Note ships with Android Nougat without any bloatware apps.

Expect the same level of software experience you get on a Motorola smartphone. In practice, stock Android does make a huge difference, especially if the phone boasts impressive specs and performance.

Lenovo K8 Note Battery review

The phone is backed by a 4,000mAh, non-removable battery, which is pretty big for a 5.5-inch phone. It was my primary phone for week; my regular use included browsing the web, playing games on the commute to and from work, checking my Facebook feed, making and receiving calls, and listening to music. Lenovo K8 Note promises to deliver enough battery to last a full working day and a bit more.

Lenovo K8 Note Camera review

Lenovo K8 Note is perhaps the company’s first smartphone to come with a dual-camera setup. The dual-lens system pairs a 13-megapixel primary sensor with a 5-megapixel secondary sensor on the back. The primary camera captures regular images, while the secondary 5-megapixel camera can be used to record depth of field information.

Lenovo K8 Note is perhaps the company’s first smartphone to come with a dual-camera setup. Lenovo K8 Note is perhaps the company’s first smartphone to come with a dual-camera setup.

The primary camera produced some stunning shots of the Jama Masjid during my recent visit to the Old Delhi. The phone camera has managed to put a lot of details in the images. I liked the the camera’s ability to capture colours accurately. It works really nice. Even photos taken in low light came out really well. This is likely due to K8 Note’s f/2.0 aperture.

The phone isn’t 100 per cent perfect at creating a bokeh. In my testing, I did notice that the camera stumbles several times to create the best bokeh effect. The camera app is basic but I didn’t notice any significant lag when shooting. There’s a 13-megapixel camera on the front, which does the job done.

Lenovo K8 Note Verdict

The Lenovo K8 Note is no revolutionary product, but it’s a smartphone that feels just right. In my opinion, this is the most mature product Lenovo has ever come up with in this price range. The things that really make the K8 Note stand out are its display, stock Android, superb performance, a dual-camera setup. The design isn’t great, though. But then again every smartphone has a flaw, right?

"Ex-officer puts out video ‘showing’ scuffle in Ladakh between Indian, Chinese troops","There have been more than 300 transgressions by China into Indian territory this year until mid-August. Around 200 such transgressions were recorded last year There have been more than 300 transgressions by China into Indian territory this year until mid-August. Around 200 such transgressions were recorded last year

A video shot on a mobile phone, reportedly showing the scuffle between Indian and Chinese soldiers on the banks of Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh on Independence Day, was put out by a retired military officer. This is bound to raise tensions as the standoff between the two armies in Doklam area of Bhutan continues even after two months.

The 44-second-long clip, which was posted by Lt General Prakash Katoch (retd) on his Facebook page on Saturday afternoon, shows stone-pelting, shoving, kicking and injuries sustained by soldiers on both sides. Official Army sources, however, said that they “have no confirmation of the authenticity of the video”.

The scuffle between the soldiers happened on Tuesday morning when a Chinese patrol was confronted by an Indian patrol, comprising Army and ITBP troopers, in Finger-4 area of Pangong. There are 10 major spurs of the mountain forming the northern bank of Pangong lake, which the Army calls ‘fingers’. India claims that the Line of Actual Control is coterminous with Finger-8, but it actually controls area up to Finger-4.

Finger-4 is around 15 km to the west of Finger-8, and there have been regular confrontations between Indian and Chinese patrols in the disputed area, claimed by both sides. However, those confrontations have never resulted in this degree of physical violence, as witnessed on Tuesday morning.

When patrols of both sides confront each other, they follow a drill to disengage. This includes unfurling of a banner with the patrol commanders facing each other, asking the other side to withdraw from its territory. Top sources told The Indian Express that the drill was initially followed by the two patrol commanders, but the Chinese patrol commander then suddenly chose to go behind his men. The Indian patrol commander was then hit by a steel rod by the Chinese soldiers, which was followed by physical violence from both sides. Sources also confirmed that injuries were sustained by many soldiers from both sides.

The incident, which was confirmed by the MEA spokesperson in Delhi on Friday, was discussed in a pre-scheduled border personnel meeting between the two armies at Chushul on Wednesday. The meeting was chaired by Brigadiers from both sides where they reiterated the need to follow established protocols and drills.

Game of Thrones Season 7 Episode 6 stills: Death is the enemy and the enemy is real,"With only two more episodes left in season 7, Game of Thrones followers are expecting a lot of action to happen in the upcoming episodes. In the last episode, Eastwatch, we saw Jon Snow begin his mission along with his fellowship (The Hound, Beric Dondarion, Thoros of Myr, Jorah Mormont, Gendry and Tormund Giantsbane) to capture a White Walker to bring to Cersei Lannister. Now, HBO has revealed some breathtaking stills from the upcoming episode titled Beyond the Wall. (Source: Photo by HBO )

The preview video already promised a major face-off between the White Walkers and Jon Snow and his crew beyond the Wall. But the pictures promise something even bigger. In this amazing shot of Tyrion and Daenerys, seems like this episode will see more of the Mother of Dragons' other two children. (Source: Photo by HBO )

Another confrontation waiting to happen is between the Stark sisters, Arya and Sansa. It is pretty clear that the two have been having a hard time trusting each other, but with Littlefinger's schemes added to the mix, let's see what happens in the next episode. But considering Arya's brilliance, it will be a little difficult for fans to digest that she fell for Lord Baelish's trap. (Source: Photo by HBO )

With Jon Snow and Ser Jorah out of the picture, looks like Tyrion finally has the opportunity to make the Queen listen to his advice. (Source: Photo by HBO )

In the last episode, we saw Drogon burn the Tarlys to death on Daenerys' orders, much to the dislike of Tyrion. Almost everyone saw glimpses of The Mad King in her but just like Varys said, 'with the proper counsel', she is a lot different from him. Will Tyrion live up to the expectations?

"Netherlands: Man holds woman hostage, arrested","Picture for representational purpose Picture for representational purpose

Dutch police quickly arrested a man armed with a knife who briefly held a woman hostage Thursday at a radio station building in the Netherlands. The woman was shocked but otherwise unhurt in the early morning incident in Hilversum, southeast of Amsterdam, said Ellen Deheer, a police spokeswoman for the Middle Netherlands region. The man’s identity and motives weren’t immediately clear, she said.

“We will talk to him about what his reasons were to take this woman as a hostage,” Deheer said. “She is shocked at this moment. It will take some time to talk to her about this.”

The man threatened the woman with a knife outside the building and forced her inside, according to another police media officer, Leonie Bosselaar. After sealing off the area, police “decided to end the situation” two hours later, entering the building, arresting the man and rescuing the woman, said Deheer.

BJP MLA Gote to take up issue of corruption in bureaucracy with PMO,"Representational image. Representational image.

BJP MLA Anil Gote has decided to take up the issue of corruption in higher bureaucracy with the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and has sought firm action against officers who have allegedly amassed disproportionate assets. “I am visiting New Delhi on August 22, with a detailed list of bureaucrats and documents supporting my claims. All I want is an impartial probe in the matter,” Gote said on Sunday.

Earlier, Gote had come out against alleged corruption by IAS officer Radheshyam Mopalwar, who was the vice chairman of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation and was executing the land acquisition for Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’ dream project Nagpur-Mumbai Samruddhi Corridor.

Audio clips that allegedly had Mopalwar talking about bribes had gone viral during the recently held monsoon session.

Fadnavis had announced Mopalwar’s removal from the post and also a detailed inquiry into the matter.

Gote, who was instrumental in raising the issue of corruption involving Mopalwar, said, “I have sought an appointment with minister of state PMO Jitendra Singh to submit the documentary evidences against bureaucrats including Mopalwar. I think some people in the state ministry are protecting the bureaucrats, which is an unacceptable thing.”

“It was me who had sent several letters to the Centre seeking probe into the malpractices of some bureaucrats. Mopalwar was one of them, where centre had set up an inquiry. Despite it, no bureaucrat has faced any legal action. I am willing to produce all the documents with the probe agencies. The only request is that they should initiate action based on the government documents,” said Gote, who is a MLA from Dhule district.

“There are some retired officers as well on my list. I have communicated it to the union government and I am hopeful that the proof I submit will be accepted,” he said.

"Nine wins on the trot makes nothing if we don’t qualify for the Asian Cup, says Stephen Constantine","Stephen Constantine has spoken of giving opportunities to youngsters to create a bigger pool of talent. (Source: AP) Stephen Constantine has spoken of giving opportunities to youngsters to create a bigger pool of talent. (Source: AP)

Indian football coach Stephen Constantine has expressed happiness after the win over Mauritius. However, he is not the one who wants to live on past glory and emphasized that India’s nine-match winning streak will count for nothing if they fail to qualify for the Asian Cup.

“It (nine wins on the trot) makes nothing if we don’t qualify for the Asian Cup, that’s what it means. I am proud to have made this little bit of history but if I don’t qualify for the Asian Cup, what’s the use of nine wins in a row, or 10 or 11 or 12,” he told reporters here last night.

“Records are there and they are nice. It is important to win, we want to win to continue to win, but our focus is 1000 percent on Macau. We need to get something in that game (against Macau), bring home and finish it (qualify),”.

Commenting on the match Constantine analyzed and said India was more dominant in the second half.

“Ok, not happy, happy but, I am ok. I have seen Mauritius, I knew they were going to play like this and they perhaps could have played a little bit better. We didn’t do what we normally do, gave them too much respect. We conceded the goal which they deserved, we were fortunate to get the equaliser, we made few change in the second half and we dominated it,” he added.

He further added, “I did not like the way we played the first half, I don’t like when we give other team the headstart, we are not the kind of team when we give other team one goal lead and we can play and another day gets punished. In the break, I told the boys to buck up in a polite way and they did,” he said.

Praising Sandesh Jhinghan, he said “He is someone who should be playing in a bigger league. The captain has to reflect the character of the coach, Sandesh is a fighter just like me. He leads by example and I think when Sunil (Chettri) is ready to packing in, we have one more person who can be captain,” he added.

Meanwhile, Mauritian skipper Kevin Bru also praised the men in blue and said, “Well done India, I am happy with my teammates as we played good football.”

UK to release tranche of Brexit position papers,"Britain’s Brexit department said on Sunday it would issue two formal position papers this week along with a batch of proposals for discussions on future relations ahead of the next round of negotiations scheduled for later this month. Britain’s Brexit department said on Sunday it would issue two formal position papers this week along with a batch of proposals for discussions on future relations ahead of the next round of negotiations scheduled for later this month.

Britain will issue a cluster of new papers this week to outline its strategy positions in divorce talks with the European Union, ranging from regulation of goods to data protection, the UK’s Brexit department said on Sunday. Prime Minister Theresa May’s government wants to push discussions with the EU beyond a focus on settling divorce arrangements to its future relationship with the bloc to bring clarity to anxious businesses, citizens and investors.

Last week, Britain issued proposals for a future customs agreement with the EU and a solution for Northern Ireland to avoid a return of border posts with the Republic of Ireland which might inflame tensions. Britain’s Brexit department said on Sunday it would issue two formal position papers this week along with a batch of proposals for discussions on future relations ahead of the next round of negotiations scheduled for later this month.

“In the coming days we will demonstrate our thinking even further, with five new papers – all part of our work to drive the talks forward, and make sure we can show beyond doubt that we have made sufficient progress on withdrawal issues by October so that we can move on to discuss our future relationship,” Britain’s Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement.

TIGHT TIMETABLE

In July, the EU’s top Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said talks on future relations had become less likely to start in October because of a lack of progress on issues such as how much Britain should pay to leave the EU, the future rights of British and EU citizens, and how to manage a land border in Ireland.

EU officials said progress had been difficult because Britain had no position at all on many issues and that an already-tight timetable could be delayed ahead of the scheduled March 2019 exit. The release of a swathe of papers this week underlines Britain’s desire to counter that criticism.

One will be a technical paper dealing with services associated with the production, sale and distribution of goods, along with their operation and repair, which Britain’s Brexit department said should form part of the exit negotiations.

“It’s basically about ensuring that when we leave there isn’t a situation where goods on the market that have been validated and checked, all of sudden we have a need for businesses to have to go through compliance checks,” a spokesman said.

In another, the government will say it is important to establish a framework on confidentiality to ensure the current system for exchanging official documents is protected.

Further papers on the future relationship will be released outlining the UK’s plans for civil judicial cooperation with the EU, dispute resolution in light of Britain’s intention to end the European Court of Justice’s jurisdiction over British matters, and on data protection.

Exactly a year ago, Neymar had struck the winning penalty for Brazil to claim their first ever Olympic football gold medal as they defeated Germany at Rio’s Maracana stadium in front of the home crowd. Currently the most expensive player in the world, Neymar had fired the winning penalty into the top corner before breaking into tears.

So much has happened in the world of football since then including major developments in Neymar’s career. But he still cannot forget the moment he won gold for Brazil. In two Instagram posts, Neymar shared a video and a picture of himself on Sunday of the moment after the final.

Neymar remembers the moment when he won the Rio 2016 Olympics as Brazil’s captain, saying that he had several mixed feelings of wanting to scream, jump, run and celebrate with his ‘companions’ all at once.

He also posted an emotional video after the final penalty when they realised that they won Olympics 2016 football tournament. He is seen hugging his teammates and jumping out of joy in the video, which he posted with the caption, “At that moment I had several mixed feelings, I wanted to scream, to jump, to run, to hug my companions, the people I love, I do not know … I wanted to do everything, but I could only cry … thank you God, for transforming our crying into joy.”

Calling the night perfect, Neymar wrote, “What time, What a final, What moment, What a day, What night, What happiness, Everything perfect.”

"We, the People: Sketching illustrations for the Constitution of India","A total of 22 illustrations were designed for the Constitution of India. (Source: Express Archive Photo) A total of 22 illustrations were designed for the Constitution of India. (Source: Express Archive Photo)

While the founding fathers of the Constitution were framing the laws that would govern India, miles from the capital, Delhi, Nandalal Bose and his students in Santiniketan were sketching illustrations that would feature in the manuscript, and would encapsulate India’s rich history, diversity and unity. It was Jawaharlal Nehru who had reportedly proposed that Bose work on the Constitution of India, where the text, too, was handwritten by calligrapher Prem Behari Narain Raizada in flowing italic.

For the world’s longest written Constitution — now carefully kept in the library of the Parliament of India — Bose and his team designed a total of 22 illustrations. Borrowing from Indian miniature tradition, Ajanta frescoes and what came to be defined as the Santiniketan style, intricate frames surround the text. The depictions span different periods. If the initial part has the popular Indus Valley seal mark, the Zebu bull, the Vedic period is represented by a scene from gurukul. We see scenes from various eras, including the Mauryan and Mughal empire, and the dancing Nataraja from the Chola tradition. The freedom movement is portrayed with a figure of Mahatma Gandhi during the Dandi March, and another frame has Subhash Chandra Bose.

Our epics find representation, too. From the Ramayana, there is Ram, Lakshman and Sita returning home; a scene from the Mahabharata has Krishna and Arjun in conversation. Buddha and Mahavira are also part of the Constitution, where the varied geographical terrain of India is also celebrated.

Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan questions CM Naveen Patnaik’s credibility as administrator,"Dharmendra Pradhan Dharmendra Pradhan

Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday questioned the credibility of Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik as an administrator saying the state government has been “exposed” by the Supreme Court’s ruling on mining scam in the state. “The Supreme Court’s remarks on the mega mining scam in Odisha was an eye opener. It has exposed the state government,” Pradhan said.

Describing the ‘Outlook India Speakout best administrator award’ given to Patnaik recently as a publicity stunt, the senior BJP leader said, “If the chief minister is hailed as the best administrator even after the mining scam involving crores of rupees during the BJD rule, it is surprising”.

On the likelihood of any coalition between BJP and BJD for the 2019 elections, Pradhan claimed that BJP is in a position to form the next government in Odisha on its own strength and there is no need for any coalition. The Union minister said, BJP president Amit Shah is in the process of rolling out a road map to dethrone the BJD government in the state in the next polls.

Claiming that BJP had lost in many constituencies by a thin margin in the last elections, Pradhan said these seats can be won in 2019 polls by strengthening the organisation at the booth level. Regarding Amit Shah’s upcoming visit to Odisha early next month, Pradhan said the BJP president’s visit is part of a strategy to strengthen the party organisation at the grassroot level.

"Anirban Lahiri adds 66 in second round, moves into contention","Anirban Lahiri turned in nine-under after three birdies in his last five holes to move into contention. (Source: File) Anirban Lahiri turned in nine-under after three birdies in his last five holes to move into contention. (Source: File)

Indian golfer Anirban Lahiri turned in nine-under after three birdies in his last five holes to move into contention in the Wyndham Championship in North Carolina.

Lahiri followed up his first round of 65 with a 66, and at nine-under he is four shots behind the leaders — Ryan Armour (61) and Webb Simpson (64) — who are at 13-under 127 halfway through the PGA Tour final event of the regular season.

Henrik Stenson was a stroke behind them after a 66. Ollie Schniederjans and Vaughn Taylor and were 11. Schniederjans shot 63, Taylor had a 66.

First-round leader Matt Every followed his 61 with a 72 to slip six strokes off the lead. Coming to terms with the Sedgefield Country Club, Lahiri said, “It was nice to find a couple of good putts coming towards the end. That’s what I have been searching for the

last few days. I certainly stroked it better. Today was better because I also got a couple of spike marks yesterday.

“Coming in, I slowed myself and made myself more precise on the greens. I am not missing the greens and I have been playing par-5s well. This is a kind of a track where one can be aggressive with wedges. You can hit the wedges on at least 10 of the holes,” he added.

As for the weekend action, Lahiri said, “Let’s see how pins are tomorrow. It is a solid leaderboard. I won’t be surprised if someone shoots a 60; it’s that kind of a track. Anybody can shoot that kind of a course. It is not that demanding a course.”

"Amid Jaypee insolvency plea: At Jantar Mantar, home buyers seek flats, justice","MEANWHILE home buyers who invested in Amrapali Group flats organised a candlelight march from Sector 16A to Film City in Noida, Saturday. They have been demanding that the builder meet them and resolve their problems. Gajendra Yadav MEANWHILE home buyers who invested in Amrapali Group flats organised a candlelight march from Sector 16A to Film City in Noida, Saturday. They have been demanding that the builder meet them and resolve their problems. Gajendra Yadav

At least 100 home buyers, who had booked flats with Jaypee Infratech in Noida and Greater Noida, protested against the company and the state government at Jantar Mantar Saturday.

Shouting slogans, holding placards and demanding justice, the protesters attempted to march towards the Parliament, but weren’t allowed to do so by police. Their demands, however, were communicated, loud and clear — the government should set a deadline for the delivery of their booked units so that there is an end to the uncertainty that has been underscoring their lives for years now.

“We have spent a lot of time and money. We had been hoping that the units will be delivered soon, but now we have run out of patience. The government has to intervene and ensure that a deadline is set and followed for delivery of our homes,” said Neeta Linz, a protester.

Although the Jaypee Group didn’t comment on Saturday’s protest, the company — which was developing about 32,000 flats and plots in its township ‘Wish Town’ — has been facing a series of protests for the last couple of weeks. At present, there is a litigation for non-completion of the project against them as well.

Earlier this week, in a bid to reach out to the home buyers who had invested in Jaypee Infratech projects, formats for submission of their claims to the projects were made public. Three formats — for operational creditors, financial creditors, workmen and employees — are available on the company’s website, and the deadline for submitting these claims is August 24.

The move came a week after an Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) was appointed when the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted IDBI’s plea for initiating insolvency proceedings against Jaypee Infratech for defaulting on a loan worth Rs 526 crore. In the aftermath of the insolvency plea, there was panic among home investors who gathered outside the builder’s office in Noida Sector 128, broke locks and barricades and demanded that their money be returned. Last Wednesday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley expressed sympathy with the agitating home buyers and maintained that all those who had invested in the builder’s projects should get their flats.

At Jantar Mantar though, protesters explained that the finance minister’s sympathy, though appreciated, wasn’t the answer.

"Spin will play a major role in Bangladesh series, says Steve Smith","Steve Smith will lead Australia against Bangladesh. (Source: AP) Steve Smith will lead Australia against Bangladesh. (Source: AP)

Australia are set to play Bangladesh in two-Test series beginning next week. The last time Australia visited the sub-continent, they faced a defeat in the four-match series against India. Australian captain Steve Smith has said that the side is expecting spin to play a major role in the series.

“Spin will play a big part throughout this series. Reverse swing will be expected because the wicket will be abrasive,” Smith said.

“It will be a challenging series,” said Smith. “Bangladesh have played some brilliant cricket here. They beat England in a Test match here not too long ago. I think they have played some very good cricket here of late. “Conditions are always foreign to us when we are in the subcontinent. The wickets are always not what we get at home,” he added.

Smith added that his side is prepared to play on similar kind of pitches on which they played in India. “I hope we can learn from the last Test series in India. I expect we will come across some pretty similar wickets, similar amount of spin. Hopefully we can learn from what we did there.”

“We have to be confident in our skill set and hopefully we can get our processes right and have a really good series,” he added.

In the last decade, Australia have only managed to win two Tests in the sub-continent and they would now be looking to capitalise on the opportunity they will get against Bangladesh.

“Australia have won only two Test matches in the last 10 years in the subcontinent, courtesy their victories over India and Sri Lanka. Now it is an opportunity for us to change that. I thought we did some things really well in India. “We just needed to do it for little bit longer, and consistently. This is another opportunity to showcase our skills, show what we learned over there and hopefully give our best foot forward,” he said.

“Hopefully the weather holds off and we can get some good cricket in the series,” Smith said. “There is some rain around. We don’t know how much time curators gonna get to give to the wicket. We will have to adapt to whatever wicket we come up against on the first morning of the Test match,” he added.

The Bannon effect: The alt-right crusader who always had Trump’s ear till his exit,"FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to chief strategist Steve Bannon during a swearing in ceremony for senior staff at the White House in Washington, U.S. January 22, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/FILE PHOTO TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to chief strategist Steve Bannon during a swearing in ceremony for senior staff at the White House in Washington, U.S. January 22, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/FILE PHOTO TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY

Stephen K. Bannon, US President Donald Trump’s embattled chief strategist and his most controversial adviser, has been the latest senior White House official to be ousted from the Trump administration amidst another major shake up. Almost immediately he has returned to Breitbart, the far-right news outlet, where he had been the editor-in-chief prior to joining the Trump administration. Bannon’s clashes with other members of the administration (often made public by himself) and Trump’s son-in-law and top White House adviser, Jared Kushner, reportedly paved the way for his firing. His departure marked the fourth senior official in five weeks to leave the Trump administration after Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer in July and Michael Flynn in February.

The appointment of Bannon, the right wing media entrepreneur with a very distinct worldview, to a top position in Trump administration in November 2016 was widely perceived as a bad sign, especially by a large number of Americans who may have been willing to give the President-elect the benefit of the doubt. Bannon’s inclusion meant having an alt-right crusader in the White House and the first of realisations that as President, Trump wasn’t going to try and build a broader support base. NPR puts it well: “Bannon’s fingerprints are everywhere, from Trump’s ‘America First’ doctrine to the dark vision laid out in his inaugural address.” So now that he’s gone, does that portend a good sign for the White House?

The Bannon effect

To be sure, it is a milestone for the Trump administration which he has influenced in profound ways. Since the time Bannon became the CEO of the Trump campaign in August 2016, he consistently echoed Trump’s populist, nativist and anti-globalist passions and as his Chief Strategist, encouraged him to stay true to his promises to his white nationalist support base. Most recently Trump’s comments on Charlottesville violence, citing moral equivalence between the white supremacists and their detractors, disappointed his aides and party members and left much of America indignant and furious but reportedly found the resonance and support of Bannon.

In his short-lived political career, Bannon helped architect the isolationist and anti-immigrant policies of the new administration, including the US’s pull out from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Paris climate accord. His towering contribution was the controversial travel ban on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries, which was eventually blocked by the courts (a much-scaled down version has been recently let through), along with the suspension of US’s refugee programs. His was a powerful voice that had Trump’s ear against the many others who would have preferred for him as President to behave more conventionally and in a manner less alienating to the majority of Americans and the world.

This clear initial influence of Bannon on Trump attracted attention in the form of appearance on the February cover of Time magazine and his famous portrayal in an SNL sketch as the dark skeleton behind the scenes — the real in-charge at the White House. Such an open blindsiding did not please Trump and Bannon was partially reined in. From a lower profile, Bannon continued to try and steer the administration’s trade and economic policy left along the lines of his economic, America-first nationalism, and against others whom he saw as the ‘establishment’ and the ‘globalists’. This is where his efforts ran into direct conflict with several members of the administration including Kushner, whom Bannon saw as too obligated to business and New York elite opinion, and the National Economic Policy Council advisor, Gary Cohn. Bannon’s suggestions for infrastructure spending, tougher trade policy with China and increasing the tax on the wealthy were ignored or waylaid by the Trump administration, which generally carried along the conventional Republican path, when it came to economics. Bannon was thus increasingly perceived by other White House officials as a mischief maker, committed to pushing his ideological agenda over working for the success of the overall administration.

Losing the whisperer

With Bannon gone, Trump has lost an adviser deeply committed to operationalising the agenda of white nationalism — someone who, as Vox frames it, “cared about policy details and lower-level personnel appointments, rather than just presidential tweets or statements.” While that is anything but unwelcome, political analysts feel that Bannon’s exit is unlikely to alter the Trump administration in high-profile ways. Bannon had been unsuccessful as it is, in pushing his economic nationalism. On immigration policy, fellow hardliners Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller are still going to be around. On race-related controversies, Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that his own instincts are quite similar to that of his former Chief Strategist’s. New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman recounted Kushner once saying — ‘Bannon plays to my father-in-law’s worst instincts’. She, however, added that Trump will likely listen more to himself and probably appoint a replacement soon. “There was a Steve Bannon before Steve Bannon … There has always been someone playing to Trump’s darker impulses. Before Bannon there was Roger Stone and before that Roy Cohn,” she said on NYT’s The Daily podcast.

The United States on Thursday offered its assistance to Spain in the wake of a deadly van attack in Barcelona’s most popular street Las Ramblas, which left at least two dead. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said that consular assistance was being provided to Americans in the city, and urged US nationals to check in with their families.

“Terrorists around the world should know — the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,” Tillerson told a press conference with Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and their Japanese counterparts.

Ousted White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon on Saturday said the Trump presidency that the right-wing conservatives helped make a reality is “over” and the president would now be “moderated” by the Republicans. Bannon, who headed the controversial right-wing website ‘Breitbart News’ before joining the Trump administration, also denied that he was fired from the key position.

Hours after he left the White House, 63-year-old Bannon returned to Breitbart News as its executive chairman and also chaired the company’s evening editorial meeting yesterday. “The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,” he told the conservative outlet Weekly Standard. “We still have a huge movement, and we will make something of this Trump presidency. But that presidency is over. It’ll be something else. And there’ll be all kinds of fights, and there’ll be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over,” said Bannon, who is generally perceived as the driving force behind Trump’s “nationalist” ideology.

Bannon says that his departure was voluntary, and that he had planned it to coincide with the one-year anniversary of his joining the Trump campaign as chief executive, on August 14, 2016. “On August 7, I talked to [Chief of Staff John] Kelly and to the President, and I told them that my resignation would be effective the following Monday, on 14th,” he said.

The former White House chief strategist said that the fight is just the beginning. “I feel jacked up. Now I’m free. I’ve got my hands back on my weapons. Someone said, ‘it’s Bannon the Barbarian.’ I am definitely going to crush the opposition. There’s no doubt…” he said.

Bannon predicted that Trump would now be moderated by the Republicans. “I think they’re going to try to moderate him.” “I think that…his (Trump’s) actual default position is the position of his base, the position that got him elected. I think you’re going to see a lot of constraints on that. It will be much more conventional,” Bannon said.

Buoyed by Bannon’s return, Breitbart News CEO and President Larry Solov said: “Breitbart’s pace of global expansion will only accelerate with Steve back. The sky’s the limit.” Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow said, “the populist-nationalist movement got a lot stronger today and the magazine gained an executive chairman with his finger on the pulse of the Trump agenda.”

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in a brief statement did not explain the reasons for Bannon’s departure. “White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve’s last day. We are grateful for his service and wish him the best,” Sanders said.

"Hyderabad Cricket Association not following Lodha panel recommendations, says Mohammad Azharuddin","While appointing the selectors, HCA ignored the Lodha panel recommendations, Mohammad Azharuddin alleged. (Source: File) While appointing the selectors, HCA ignored the Lodha panel recommendations, Mohammad Azharuddin alleged. (Source: File)

Former India skipper Mohammed Azharuddin on Saturday stated that Lodha Committee recommendations are not being followed by Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA). During the elections for the post of HCA president, which were held in January, Azharuddin’s nomination got rejected.

While appointing the selectors, HCA ignored the Lodha panel recommendations, he alleged. “According to the Lodha panel, selectors who played at least 25 first class matches should be appointed as selectors.”

He added: “The purpose of my press conference is to bring in (to) the notice of the Supreme Court, the misconduct and blatant disregard of the judgements of the Supreme Court-appointed Lodha Committee.”

“I urge all of you in the media, to bring to light the daring misconduct and the sorry state of affairs of Hyderabad Cricket Association and all sorts of misuse happening there,” he concluded.

HCA President G Vivekanand denied Azharuddin’s statements, “The Committee of Administrators are there. They are looking into the implementation of the Lodha Committee reforms. The issue is sub-judice. If anything is there, he (Azharuddin) can go to the Supreme Court,” he said while speaking to PTI.

He said that the players who performed well were not selected in the teams for Moin-ud-Dowla cricket tournament. “It is very unfortunate that both the teams of HCA participating in Moin-ud-Dowla have been announced, those players who have scored more than three centuries in two day leagues and those who have taken more than five wickets have been totally ignored,” he said.

Rafael Nadal returns to No. 1 with heavy heart over Barcelona,"Rafael Nadal moves up to World No 1 on Monday. (Source: AP) Rafael Nadal moves up to World No 1 on Monday. (Source: AP)

Spain’s Rafael Nadal, who returns to the world number one ranking on Monday for the first time in three years, remains “destroyed” by the terror attacks that rocked his homeland. Nadal was upset by Australia’s Nick Kyrgios in a Friday quarter-final at the WTA and ATP Cincinnati Masters, the last major tune-up for the US Open. He wore black ribbons during an earlier match in tribute to the victims of twin vehicle ramming attacks in Spain that left 14 dead. A driver plowed his van through crowds on Barcelona’s busy Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday, and early Friday a car struck pedestrians in the Catalan seaside resort of Cambrils.

“What happened is terrible. Everybody is destroyed in Spain, including, of course, me,” Nadal said Friday. “Yeah, it’s a tragedy, the feeling that you are not safe in nowhere. That’s terrible. So just very sad. I’m very, very sorry about what happened to all the victims, all the families, friends. Yeah, all my support. It’s the moment to be together like a country and all the being together, we go for these kind of things.”

Spanish rival Albert Ramos-Vinolas and Wimbledon women’s champion Garbine Muguruza also wore black ribbons. “All my support to Barcelona and especially to the people that are suffering a lot, for all the families of the victims,” Nadal said. “Just keep going and sorry for everything.”

Nadal, a 15-time Grand Slam champion, won his 10th French Open title in June and enters the year’s final Grand Slam event, which starts August 28 in New York, thrilled at being back atop the rankings after knee injuries and setbacks since he was last number one back in July 2014. “Amazing, positive news,” Nadal said. “Being number one after all the things I’ve been going through the last couple of years is something unbelievable, so for me it’s an amazing achievement to be back to that position.

“I’m very happy for that and in the last most important event of the season, I need to show why I am in that position now. So I’m going to work hard to show myself why I’m there. I’m going to try my best to play at the highest level possible in New York.”

Nadal plans to rest through the weekend, then resume workouts for the final week before the Flushing Meadows fortnight begins. “I think I am practicing well. I’m going to give my best during this week of practice,” Nadal said. “I hope to be ready for New York. I believe that I did things well enough during the whole year to be ready to compete at the highest level of New York, so I’m looking forward to it.”

"After 45 years, murder conviction scratched for Michigan man","In a photo provided by the Michigan Department of Corrections, Richard Phillips is shown. (Source: AP) In a photo provided by the Michigan Department of Corrections, Richard Phillips is shown. (Source: AP)

A man in prison for 45 years could be on the cusp of freedom after another man said he had no role in a 1971 murder in Detroit. A judge last week threw out Richard Phillips’ conviction and granted a new trial. Wayne County prosecutors have pledged to appeal. For decades, Phillips, now 71, has declared his innocence in the fatal shooting of Gregory Harris. He was convicted largely on the testimony of a trial witness who has since died.

But now he’s been cleared in a remarkable way. Richard Palombo, a co-defendant at the 1972 trial, admitted his role in the fatal shooting during a parole board hearing in 2010. Palombo also repeatedly said Phillips wasn’t present. “All I can tell you about Mr. Phillips is I met him on July 4, 1971. It was eight days after the murder,” Palombo told the board.

Four years after that testimony, in 2014, the Innocence Clinic at University of Michigan law school learned what Palombo had said and ordered a transcript. The clinic also informed Phillips. “He was shocked. He had spent 43 years at the time believing Palombo was as innocent as he was,” said clinic director David Moran.

Moran said he had to rule out any possible collusion between Phillips and Palombo. He learned they had never been housed in the same prison or exchanged letters. Judge Kevin Cox said he’s satisfied that Palombo’s detailed testimony at the parole board was newly discovered evidence. Palombo declined to speak when summoned to court earlier this year.

Phillips “is granted a new trial,” the judge wrote on August 8. Cox’s decision will be appealed. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office, Maria Miller, said Palombo’s testimony is hearsay and can’t be admitted as evidence. The next hearing is Aug. 25.

Professors and students at Michigan law school have exonerated or helped free more than a dozen people since 2009 by exposing bad police work, finding new witnesses and tapping specialists. “This is certainly the oldest case we’ve accepted by far,” Moran said.

(AP Photo/Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi, File)

Zimbabwe’s first lady Grace Mugabe returned from South Africa early on Sunday, state media reported, after a 20-year-old model accused her of assault in an upmarket Johannesburg hotel room. South African police had placed border posts on “red alert” to prevent her leaving the country, but a security source told Reuters on Friday that the wife of 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe had been granted diplomatic immunity.

Zimbabwean state media reported that the president and first lady arrived in Harare aboard an Air Zimbabwe plane in the early hours of Sunday. A source confirmed this to Reuters. A bruised Gabriella Engels has accused Grace Mugabe of whipping her with an electric extension cable a week ago as she waited with two friends in a luxury hotel suite to meet one of Mugabe’s adult sons.

President Mugabe attended a South African Development Community summit in Pretoria on Saturday, but his 52-year-old wife was not there or part of his delegation. Harare has made no official comment on the saga and requests for comment from Zimbabwean government officials have gone unanswered. The South African government has limited all official comment to the police ministry and international relations department spokespeople did not answer calls for comment.

South Africa’s main opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA), blamed the ministers of police, international relations and defence for the failure to detain Mugabe and said it wants the matter investigated. “The DA will be demanding an immediate parliamentary inquiry into (the) government’s complicity in allowing Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe to flee the country in the dead of night to avoid criminal prosecution,” DA whip John Steenhuisen said in a statement.

Compounding the awkward diplomatic situation, commercial flights between Zimbabwe and South Africa were grounded on Friday and Saturday, affecting both national carriers, after unexpected checks for operating permits. South African Airways resumed flights to Zimbabwe, it said in a statement on Sunday, and an Air Zimbabwe flight also departed from Harare to South Africa on Sunday morning.

Govt mulls if NEET should be a must to study medicine abroad,"The Centre is looking at a proposal to make the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) mandatory for students planning to study medicine abroad, a senior health ministry official has said. Clearing NEET is a must to study medicine in any government or private medical college in India. Under the new proposal on which the Union health ministry has started stakeholder consultations, a student who has not cleared NEET will not get the Essentiality Certificate (EC) from the Medical Council of India that is required for admission in any medical college outside India.

First mooted in 2013, NEET became the sole exam for entry into all medical colleges from 2016 after prolonged court battles with deemed universities, minority institutions and states contesting the common test on a myriad grounds.

According to government sources, the ministry may, at a later stage, look at the option of issuing ECs only to students going to institutions that rank high on their respective national lists. Both moves, the government hopes, will streamline foreign medical education and raise the dismal pass percentage in the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE) that students have to clear before they get the licence to practise medicine in India.

“The pass percentage in the FMGE examination every year is in the range of 10-15 per cent. This is a function of two things — the quality of intake and the quality of training that the colleges impart. There is a need for some sort of control over this because there is no point in Indian students going for a five-and-a-half-year course abroad that costs a lot of money and then not being able to practise medicine once they come back. So we are looking at making NEET mandatory even for students intending to study medicine abroad. We have already started consultations,” said the senior official in the health ministry.

About 6 lakh students qualify NEET every year of which only 67,000 can be accommodated in Indian medical colleges and another 27,000 in the dental colleges.

“In countries where the accreditation system is reliable, ECs may be issued only for the top institutes and not for the others,” the official added.

In the case of NEET exemption for a year in Tamil Nadu, the health ministry has sought the opinion of the attorney-general on an ordinance the state wants to bring. The law ministry has already cleared the ordinance.

"Everton one of the best in Premier League, says Pep Guardiola","Pep Guardiola is wary of the all-round threat provided by Everton. (Source: Reuters) Pep Guardiola is wary of the all-round threat provided by Everton. (Source: Reuters)

Everton are one of the best teams in the Premier League with excellent players and Manchester City will likely face a tough test when they host the Merseyside club on Monday, City manager Pep Guardiola said on Friday.

City drew 1-1 at home with Everton last season and the reverse fixture in January marked Guardiola’s heaviest league loss as a manager, with his side losing 4-0 at Goodison Park.

With Everton bolstering their squad with nine new signings, Guardiola is wary of the all-round threat provided by manager Ronald Koeman’s side.

“Everton are a top squad and they have bought good players. They are one of the best teams in the league, I am sure of that,” Guardiola told reporters.

“I expect they will play the same way (as last season), attack our backs,” Guardiola said. “They have a strong defence, they have excellent players.”

City have already spent more than 200 million pounds ($257 million) to strengthen their ranks and British media reports have also linked the club with a move for West Bromwich Albion defender Jonny Evans.

Earlier on Friday, West Brom manager Tony Pulis confirmed his club had rejected a bid for their captain, but Guardiola said the situation at City had not changed, choosing to focus on his team’s broad transfer goals instead.

“We tried to do the best as possible for the new season, and we are going to see how the market finishes at the end of the season,” Guardiola told reporters. “We stay with the players we have right now, if someone comes we will be happy too.

“I know how hard the club works … We talk with Txiki, but everyone has his own opinions and after that we try to decide who should make our club stronger,” he said, referring to City’s Director of Football Txiki Begiristain.

Guardiola said defender Benjamin Mendy and midfielder Fabian Delph were yet to recover from injury, while midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who featured in the club’s friendly against Girona on Tuesday, was close to full match fitness.

Fitness is not just a habit, it is a lifestyle; one that requires commitment and dedication so dont let monsoon dampen your spirits. Some quick and easy steps like working out indoors or getting few simpler exercising devices can do the trick for you, say experts.

Reebok Master Trainer Gagan Arora encourages you to keep your body engine fueled every day, with these simple things to keep in mind during rainy days.

* Run those miles: The body is waterproof so do not fret to take those extra laps in the rain. An outdoor workout keeps the body metabolism going and helps you stay fit and energized.

* Stay active through the day: If heading out in the rain is not your cup of tea, workout indoors. Pack in a short 30 – 40 minutes schedule that includes a mix of squats, push-ups, planks. Apart from homemade food, add seasonal fruits and vegetables along with lean meat and legumes to your diet.

* The ‘Right’ Gear: Wear bright coloured speed wick or Active Chill fitness gear and socks as they will keep you cool during humidity, dry quickly and reduce the chances of chaffing.

* Monsoon gateways: Take a break from your routine and unwind with a quick getaway during the rains. Plan a fun ‘Fitcation’ that includes long walks and fun outdoor games with family and friends to stay active, energized and light this monsoon.

* Vitamins are vital – Add vitamins to your diet to keep infections at bay and maintain your energy levels. Get enough rest, stay indoors and relax if not feeling well.

Additionally, Meenakshi Subramaniyam, coach at HealthifyMe.com also added few tips.

* Stick to the same time plan for workout sessions at home. Make sure the session is 45 minutes at least.

* Start with simple stretching exercises to warm-up followed by five minutes spot jogging. Follow it up with 15 minutes of rigorous cardio to get the heart beat up and start the fat burning process. One can opt for skipping, stair climbing, hopping, jumping jacks etc. To strengthen body muscles for toning the body and preventing joints from injury, do a combination of 20 squats + 20 lunges (each leg) + 20 pushups. You repeat this set 2-4 times as per your capacity.

* Get few simple exercising devices like dumbells, skipping rope, resistance tubes etc at home and try hardcore floor exercises like planks, crunches and leg raises. You can start with a plank position for 30 seconds and repeat it again. Then lie down on your back and do 20 crunches + 20 reverse crunches + 20 alternate leg raises. Repeat this set 2 times. An indoor jog on the spot or around a house jog is also beneficial, or Leslie walks which can be done indoors.

* Yoga can be performed both indoors and outdoors. Select an airy spot in your house practice simple asanas to keep yourself fit. Yoga also helps reduce respiratory problems that are very common during the monsoon season.

*Dance workouts are fun and flexible to enjoy indoor monsoon workout.

Deccan Queen cancelled today due to power block,"Sinhagad Express, Pragati Express, Sahyadri Express, Hyderabad Express and Kolhapur-Mumbai Express will be routed via Karjat-Panvel-Thane on Sunday. (File) Sinhagad Express, Pragati Express, Sahyadri Express, Hyderabad Express and Kolhapur-Mumbai Express will be routed via Karjat-Panvel-Thane on Sunday. (File)

TRAIN traffic between Pune and Mumbai would be affected on Sunday morning due to a power block being operated by the Central Railway between Dombivli and Kalyan stations over the ongoing work of construction of a Road Over Bridge (ROB) there. Many trains including the Deccan Queen would be affected due to the power block.

An official statement issued by the Central Railway said while the Deccan Queen has been cancelled on Sunday, Sinhagad Express, Pragati Express, Sahyadri Express, Hyderabad Express and Kolhapur-Mumbai Express would be routed via Karjat-Panvel-Thane.

A statement went on to add that the block was being taken for launching of four girders in connection with construction of Road Over Bridge at Thakurli from 9.15 am to 12.45 pm. Suburban services would remain suspended between Kalyan and Dombivli stations from 9.10 am to 12.50 pm on Sunday.

Apart from the Deccan Queen, other trains that have been cancelled on Sunday are Panchvati Express and Godavari Express, official said. Nagour-CSMT Sevagram Express would be terminated at Nasik Road. It would depart from Nasik Road to Nagpur at 6.35 pm, official said.

Harsha Shah of Railway Pravasi Group said that such blocks were unavoidable while undertaking civil work. She said the work should have been planned in a better manner to minimise the inconvenience to passengers.

“Such blocks are planned months in advance. It is desirable that the railway administration announces them at least a month or fortnight prior so that passengers can plan their travel. In today’s case, they announced just two days prior and people who have booked tickets would suffer unnecessarily. They will have to buy fresh tickets for Pragati Express since the train doesn’t accept Deccan Queen tickets or monthly passes and brace for a tough journey as the capacity of Pragati is insufficient to accommodate the passengers of Deccan Queen,” said Shah.

"Spain hunts for driver in van rampage, says Islamist cell dismantled","People flee from the scene after a white van jumped the sidewalk in the historic Las Ramblas district of Barcelona, Spain, crashing into a summer crowd of residents and tourists Thursday. (Source: AP Photo) People flee from the scene after a white van jumped the sidewalk in the historic Las Ramblas district of Barcelona, Spain, crashing into a summer crowd of residents and tourists Thursday. (Source: AP Photo)

Police were searching on Saturday for the driver of a van that killed 13 people when it ploughed into a crowd in Barcelona and were trying to determine whether two other suspected Islamist militants linked to the attack had died or were at large. The Spanish government said it considered it had dismantled the cell behind Thursday’s Barcelona rampage and an attack early on Friday in the Catalan seaside town of Cambrils.

Police arrested four people in connection with the attacks Barcelona and Cambrils, where a woman was killed when a car rammed passersby on Friday. Five attackers wearing fake explosive belts were also shot dead in the Catalan town. “The cell has been fully dismantled in Barcelona, after examining the people who died, the people who were arrested and carrying out identity checks,” Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido told a news conference.

But authorities have yet to identify the driver of the van and his whereabouts are unclear, while police and officials in the northeastern region of Catalonia said they still needed to locate up to two other people. Investigators are focusing on a group of at least 12 suspects believed to be behind the deadliest attacks to hit Spain in more than a decade.

In little more than a year, militants have used vehicles as weapons to kill nearly 130 people in France, Germany, Britain, Sweden and Spain. None of the nine people arrested or shot dead by police are believed to be the driver who sped into Las Ramblas, leaving a trail of dead and injured among the crowds of tourists and local residents strolling along the Barcelona boulevard.

A Moroccan-born 22-year-old called Younes Abouyaaqoub was among those being sought, according to the mayor’s office in the Catalan town of Ripoll, where he and other suspects lived. Spanish media reported that Abouyaaqoub may have been the driver of the van in Barcelona, but police and Catalan officials could not confirm this.

The driver in the Barcelona attack abandoned the van and fled on foot on Thursday after ploughing into the crowd. Fifty people were still in hospital on Saturday following that attack, with 13 in a critical condition. Many were foreign tourists. The Mediterranean region of Catalonian is thronged in the summer months with visitors drawn to its beaches and the port city of Barcelona’s museums and tree-lined boulevards. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks in Cambrils and Barcelona, a statement by the jihadist group said on Saturday.

RAIDS

Police searched a flat in Ripoll on Friday in their hunt for people connected to the attacks, the ninth raid so far on homes in the town nestled in the foothills of the Pyrenees near the French border. The flat had been occupied by a man named as Abdelbaki Es Satty, according to a search warrant seen by Reuters. Neighbours said he was an imam, a Muslim prayer leader. His landlord said he had last been seen on Tuesday.

Scraps of paper covered in notes were strewn around the flat, which had been turned upside down in the police search. Three Moroccans and a citizen of Spain’s North African enclave of Melilla have been arrested so far in connection with the attacks. Apart from Abouyaaqoub, authorities are searching for two other people though it is not certain they are at large.

One or even both of them may have been killed in Alcanar, where a house was razed by an explosion shortly before midnight on Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Catalonia’s home affairs department said. Casting new doubts over the investigation, El Pais said late on Saturday that biological remains of at least three people had been found in the ruins of the Alcanar house. It was not clear whether they could be from the three suspects still sought by the police or if more people were there.

Police believe the house in Alcanar was being used to plan one or several large-scale attacks in Barcelona, possibly using a large number of butane gas canisters stored there. The Spanish government maintained its security alert level at four, one notch below the maximum level that would indicate another attack was imminent, but said it would reinforce security in crowded areas and tourist hotspots. Spanish media also said that security at the border with France was being beefed up.

TRIBUTES

Of the 14 dead in the two attacks, five are Spanish, two are Italians, two are Portuguese, one Belgian, one Canadian and one a US citizen, emergency services and authorities from those countries have confirmed so far. A seven-year-old boy with British and Australian nationality who had been missing since the attack in Barcelona was found on Saturday in one of the city’s hospitals and was in a serious condition, El Pais newspaper reported.

Spain’s King Felipe and Queen Letizia on Saturday visited some of the dozens injured whose nationalities ranged from French and German to Pakistani and the Filipino. They are being treated in various Barcelona hospitals. The royal couple are expected to take part in a Catholic mass on Sunday morning at architect Antoni Gaudi’s famous Sagrada Familia church, a Barcelona landmark, in honour of the victims of the attack.

Barcelona’s football team will wear special shirts, bearing the Catalan words for “We are all Barcelona”, and black armbands in memory of victims when they play their opening league game of the season on Sunday evening against Real Betis.

"Germany: In Berlin, Graffiti activists turning Nazi symbols into art","A counter demonstration marches in Berlin on Saturday after Police in Berlin have given far-right extremists permission to hold a 500-person strong rally commemorating the death of Adolf Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess in the city’s western district of Spandau.

Horrified at the sight of swastikas scrawled on walls, children’s playgrounds and building sites, a group of graffiti artists in Berlin is transforming the Nazi symbols into colourful artwork such as flowers, cars and animals. The swastika, which was adopted by Adolf Hitler’s Nazi party, is banned in Germany, where right-wing sentiment has risen due to an influx of more than a million migrants in the last two years.

Ibo Omari, who runs a graffiti shop and ‘The Cultural Heirs’ youth club, encourages young people to look out for swastikas in their local area and then creatively paint over them – after getting permission from whoever owns the defaced property. “It was important to spur young people into action and to encourage them to take responsibility so they don’t just ignorantly walk past such symbols of hatred,” Omari told Reuters. “It offends the whole neighbourhood if someone in our midst paints swastikas in a children’s playground and I take it personally,” the 37-year-old said, adding that they also wanted to show graffiti had nothing to do with racism.

Omari and ‘The Cultural Heirs’ decided the best way to respond was “with humour and love” so they came up with designs such as rabbits, birds and a Rubik’s Cube to cover swastikas. Sketching potential designs during a graffiti workshop in Omari’s shop, 16-year-old Philip Keilholz said he got involved as racism had no place in the cosmopolitan German capital.

“When tourists come to Berlin and look at a wall and see a swastika, they’ll think: ‘What’s going on here? There are Nazis everywhere!’ And we don’t want that,” he said. “An artistic symbol obviously looks much nicer than an ugly message and then people walk through the city with a smile on their faces,” he added.

The group has already transformed around 25 swastikas and their ‘PaintBack’ initiative has been copied by people in other cities including Hamburg, Kiel and Bremen. Omari was shocked into starting the project in 2015 when a man came into his shop to get some cans of spray paint to cover a swastika in a park where he had been playing with his son. Two weeks later Omari heard about swastikas painted in a skate park.

“I felt like I was in the wrong film,” said Omari. “There has been a shift towards the right in Germany and not just in Germany but in Europe overall … so it’s important to nail your colours to the mast.”

Davis Love sets sights on being oldest winner in PGA Tour history,"Denis Love could have been even closer, failing to capitalise on the brilliant front nine en route to a three-under-par 67. (Source: AP) Denis Love could have been even closer, failing to capitalise on the brilliant front nine en route to a three-under-par 67. (Source: AP)

Davis Love has a chance to become the oldest PGA Tour winner, three strokes behind leader Henrik Stenson after the third round at the Wyndham Championship on Saturday.

The 53-year-old could have been even closer, failing to capitalise on the brilliant front nine en route to a three-under-par 67 at Sedgefield Country Club.

Love, who went to college at the University of North Carolina in nearby Chapel Hill, is already the third oldest winner on tour after his triumph here two years ago.

The only older winners are Sam Snead, who won this event in 1965 at the age of 52, and Art Wall, who was 51 when he captured the 1975 Greater Milwaukee Open.

“I’ve got a chance, though there are a lot of guys who’ve got a chance unfortunately,” Love said after signing for a 13-under 197 total heading into Sunday’s final round.

A chance to supplant Snead as the oldest winner is something for Love to savour having known Sneed well before he died in 2002 at the age of 89.

“I spent a lot of time with him,” said Love. “He gave me some tips and some lessons but (most of all) inspiration.” Love, whose 21 tour wins include three victories in Greensboro, surged into contention when he picked up four strokes on the front nine.

“With a 31 on the front nine I put myself in good position to shoot a good score but I had a couple of unforced errors on the back,” he said.

The first of those unforced errors came after he ripped his drive 300 yards over a fairway bunker at the par-four 10th, but inexplicably caught his 120-yard approach shot fat, coming up 30 yards short.

A deft up-and-down to save par preserved his momentum, and he perhaps should have birdie the par-four 13th, his 15-foot putt stopping on the edge of the cup.

A bogey at the next, where he overshot the green with his approach from rough, halted his progress, and he was lucky to avoid a water hazard with his second shot at the par-five 15th, fellow competitor Kevin Na yelling “safe” to inform Love his ball was dry.

Why Scams are Here to Say: Understanding Political Corruption in India

Author: N Ram

Publisher: Aleph Book Company

202 pages

Following demonetisation 2016, there has been heightened public interest in the black economy and corruption in India. The public thinks of scams as the big cases of corruption involving the high and mighty political and business leaders. The book under review largely analyses this linkage in both theoretical terms and with reference to some specific cases. The definitional aspects, links with media and the executive are explored.

The book comprises three sections divided into eight chapters. There is an introduction and a long conclusion where the author discusses what can be done. Section I, consisting of three chapters, presents the “story of corruption in India”. Section II provides the context by focussing on “historical, conceptual and theoretical issues”. Chapter 6 presents the author’s understanding, based on the Marxist view of political corruption, which is seen as an alternative to mainstream approaches. He critiques the “overly simplified moral” view underlying the “failed” JP and Anna Hazare movements.

Section III presents two important case studies which the author had directly dealt with, which give insights into the links between scams and politics in India. These two scams are Bofors and J Jayalaithaa’s disproportionate assets case. He hypothesises that “several Indian states have their own corruption systems”. So, there is a need for focussed empirical research to help find ways to combat corruption. The author states that the problem has become intractable without a change in India’s political economy. In the conclusion, he nonetheless presents suggestions under nine broad headings — “laws, enforcement capacity, policies, institutions, regulation, vigilance, corporate sector, journalism and politics”.

The author describes the “grand corruption that operates year-round with clockwork, “scientific precision.” However, this is true of most black income generation (and not just big corruption) and that is why in the literature it has been called “systemic and systematic”. The book points out that it is the joint product of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen. In the literature, it has been called the “triad” and dismantling it is crucial to tackling black economy and corruption. This requires accountability, especially of the political class. While RTI can help in this, it is the public that has to act by not electing the corrupt. But, the public often has little choice since political parties put up the corrupt and the criminal in the belief that they can deliver.

In Chapter 3 and the conclusion, flawed laws and their weak enforcement are discussed. The author veers to the view that the government is overburdened compared to other countries. But, laws are laws in letter and spirit. If the spirit is weak, then howsoever good a law maybe, it can be circumvented by clever people to their advantage. That has been India’s experience, whether we think of the anti-defection laws, election financing law or the Income Tax Act.

The book misses the impact of corruption/scams on society — it leads to policy failure and to inefficiencies, which lower the rate of growth of the economy below its potential. In addition, it results in “social waste” so that welfare associated with growth diminishes. Consequently, even when incomes rise, poverty does not decline and inequality rises.

The book presents the historical context of corruption in India and mentions the idea of “Asiatic Corruption”. The author points out that the real scandal of the Empire was the loot of India and that was the bigger corruption. The idea that India was a corrupt country before British rule needs to be revisited. Corruption needs to be defined in relation to the laws of the land. If paying money to state officials for work to be done is customary or when the empire of a vanquished king is usurped by the victor, can it be called corruption? There is a fine line between legality and illegality, and this line shifts with changes in laws and the social understanding prevailing at that point of time.

In India, if the black economy is taken as a measure of the level of corruption, the size has grown from 4-5 per cent in 1955-56 to the present 62 per cent of GDP. If one extrapolates back, the level of corruption during colonial rule was low largely because most people had little to do with the state, which was small in size. Since the 1950s, the number of major scams in the country has been exploding in both number and the amount of money involved (See my Indian Economy since Independence: Persisting Colonial Disruption).

The book highlights the role of the private sector, especially MNCs (in spite of rules in advanced countries). In conclusion, the author says that “it would be irresponsible for citizens to stand aside”. The implication is clear: movements are crucial to the battle against corruption.

"No salary for 9 months, 1,600 Delhi Metro workers go on strike","Metro contractors and labourers, at Jantar Mantar. Abhinav Saha Metro contractors and labourers, at Jantar Mantar. Abhinav Saha

Apart from sending half of his monthly income home to his mother and three siblings in Katihar, Bihar, 19-year-old Anzar Alam saves a tiny sum every month for emergencies. But now that his village has been hit by a flood, he feels helpless. “I haven’t been paid in the last two months, so I have spent my savings on rent and food…I need money urgently so my family in Katihar can survive,” said Alam, one of the 1,600 labourers with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) protesting at Jantar Mantar since August 17.

Along with the labourers, contractors too have taken to the streets demanding “pending payments of nine months from DMRC and FEMC Pratibha,” which, according to labour contractor Ashish Dwivedi, amounts to “Rs 25 crore”. “We are paid by FEMC Pratibha but nine months ago when we stopped work, DMRC intervened and assured us that they will pay us… since then, partial payments have been made over a month or two,” said Dwivedi, who has 300 labourers under him.

When The Indian Express approached the DMRC, Anuj Dayal, Executive Director, Corporate Communications, said, “A section of workers hired by one of DMRC’s contractors, M/s FEMC Pratibha have been agitating over alleged non-payment of dues for the last few days. DMRC would like to clarify that these workers have not been directly recruited or hired by Delhi Metro.”

DMRC also does not pay the salaries directly to these workers. The contractor has been directed to clear all dues and DMRC is also closely monitoring the situation.A Metro spokesperson added, “If labourer makes any complaint to DMRC regarding non-payment of wages, DMRC takes appropriate steps. In this case, no individual labourer has made complaints. This is the matter of dues between sub-contractor and the main contractor.”

Even as the rain brought the city to a standstill on Saturday, hundreds continued to sit on a dharna at Jantar Mantar, along with 25 labour contractors. “I have paid salaries of the 250 labourers under me for seven months by taking loans…I am in debt now, no longer capable of paying them, which is why we are protesting,” said contractor Babloo Tripathi.

The labourers and contractors also revealed that work on Delhi Metro phase III is on hold due to the protest. “At the moment, no work is happening at the nine Metro stations of phase III, which is already delayed by many months…if they don’t meet our demand, we will also put functioning metro service on hold, and lie down on the tracks in protest,” said Tripathi.

DMRC, on the other hand, maintained that “there is no delay. We are doing our structural and finishing work. These supply contractors were only doing house keeping work, helping the mechanical and electrical department in their work, the job of office attendants and other miscellaneous work. This is not affecting our schedule as these are ancillary activities”.Meanwhile, labourers such as Rajesh Yadav who hails from Bhadohi near Allahabad, continue to “ignore desperate phone calls from home as there is no money to send.”

"Scuffle between soldiers, policeman in Kupwara","Google Map Google Map

AN ALTERCATION was reported between Army and Jammu and Kashmir Police personnel on Friday night in Kupwara town of north Kashmir over a speeding car that was stopped and seized by the soldiers near a barricade. While some policemen alleged that Shabir Ahmad, the munshi of Kupwara police station who was present at the spot, was manhandled by soldiers from 41 Rashtriya Rifles, Kupwara SSP Shamsheer Hussain said there was “an altercation” but refused allegations that the policeman was beaten up.

On Friday night, sources said, a civilian tried to overtake a few cars near a police and Army barricade in Kupwara town and was flagged down by the RR personnel. They dragged out the driver, and as they allegedly manhandled him, Ahmad, a police official present at the spot, took objection to this “harassment”. “He (Ahmad) had to be taken to the Sub District Hospital in Kupwara,” a police source said.

Denying this, the SSP said, “The Armymen tried to stop the car but they (people in it) ran away, leaving the vehicle behind. The soldiers seized the car. When our official asked them to hand over the car to the police, they (soldiers) refused and said they would not hand it over until their commanding officer arrives. There was an altercation between them (over this).” But senior officers arrived there soon and “the matter was resolved amicably,” the SSP said. While some reports indicated that the Station House Officer (SHO) was also there, Singh said the SHO was not present at the spot. SHO, Kupwara, Mohammed Ashraf said the police are inquiring and checking facts since the incident took place late at night. “We have also taken up the issue with the General Officer Commanding (GOC),” he said. “The law will take its course.”

The Defence public relations officer did not respond despite repeated attempts. Last month, seven policemen were allegedly beaten up by Army personnel after the policemen stopped private vehicles carrying plainclothed soldiers at a checkpost in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district. The police later registered a case against 24 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) unit personnel after the policemen, including an assistant sub-inspector who was on Amarnath Yatra duty, were injured.

Police in Finland say they have shot a man in the leg after he was suspected of stabbing several people in the western city of Turku. (File) Emergency services working in Turku Market Square in Turku Finland on Friday. Police in Finland say they have shot a man in the leg after he was suspected of stabbing several people in the western city of Turku. (File)

Finnish police said on Saturday that an 18-year-old Moroccan man, arrested after a knife rampage that killed two people and wounded eight, appeared to have targeted women and that the spree was being treated as the country’s first terrorism-related attack. The suspect arrested following the attack on Friday after being shot in the leg by police in the city of Turku had arrived in Finland last year, police said. They said they later arrested four other Moroccan men over possible links to him and had issued an international arrest warrant for a sixth Moroccan national.

Finnish broadcaster MTV, citing an unnamed source, said the main suspect had been denied asylum in Finland. The police said only that he had been “part of the asylum process”.

The case marks the first suspected terror attack in Finland, where violent crime is relatively rare.

“The suspect’s profile is similar to that of several other recent radical Islamist terror attacks that have taken place in Europe,” Director Antti Pelttari from the Finnish Security Intelligence Service told a news conference.

The police said they were investigating possible links to Thursday’s deadly van attack in the Spanish city of Barcelona.

Both of those killed in the Turku attack, and six of the eight who were wounded, were women, the police said. The two who died were Finns, and an Italian and two Swedish citizens were among the injured.

“It seems that the suspect chose women as his targets, because the men who were wounded were injured when they tried to help, or prevent the attacks,” said Crista Granroth from the National Bureau of Investigation.

“The act was cowardly … we have been afraid of this and we have prepared for this. We are not an island anymore, the whole of Europe is affected,” Prime Minister Juha Sipila said.

SCREAMING

The stabbing spree occurred on Friday afternoon in the main market place in Turku, on the southwest coast of the country, 160 kilometres from Helsinki.

“First thing we heard was a young woman, screaming like crazy. I thought it’s just kids having fun … but then people started to move around and I saw a man with a knife in his hand, stabbing a woman,” said Laura Laine, who was sitting in a cafe.

“Then a person ran towards us shouting ‘He has a knife’, and everybody from the terrace ran inside. Next, a woman came in to the cafe. She was crying hysterically, down on her knees, saying someone’s neck has been slashed open.”

Four of the wounded were still in hospital, three of them in intensive care, while the other injured persons would be sent home on Saturday, the hospital said.

Turku’s Iraqi, Syrian and Islamic community condemned the attacks and organised a rally of solidarity in the city’s main square, but decided to cancel it due to security concerns.

“Finns and immigrants, and people from different religions, have had very good relations in Turku… We are shocked, but I don’t see this changing that,” said Abdirahman Mohamed, Chairman of the Islamic community of Turku.

He said the Moroccan suspects were not familiar to him or to the Islamic community in town, which has around 2,000 members.

TENSIONS

An Anti-immigration mood has been on the rise in Finland since it received some 32,500 asylum seekers during the migration crisis in 2015.

Tensions simmered on Saturday Turku as the anti-immigration “Finland First” movement held a rally but it was met by counter-demonstrators brandishing signs saying “No room for racism”.

In Helsinki, about 200 people gathered in the rain to protest against the construction of a mosque and Muslim immigration to Finland in a rally planned by the Finnish far-right group the Finnish Defence League (FDL) before the attack.

Some members of the nationalist Finns party, which was kicked out of the government in June for their new hard-line anti-immigration leadership, blamed the government for what they said was too loose an immigration policy.

“The asylum system is the primary road for illegal immigration, used also by the terrorists. Harmful immigration can be controlled only by reducing Finland’s attractiveness, or by border controls,” said Finns party lawmaker Ville Tavio. The government has already tightened immigration policies in the past few years, along with other Nordic states.

Ohio man accused of plotting US attacks set to be sentenced,"Court documents unsealed earlier this summer show Mohamud pleaded guilty almost two years ago to terrorism charges. Court documents unsealed earlier this summer show Mohamud pleaded guilty almost two years ago to terrorism charges.

An Ohio man charged with plotting to kill military members in the U.S. after receiving overseas training is scheduled to be sentenced.

Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud (ab-dee-RAH’-mahn shayk moh-HAH’-mud) is set to be sentenced Friday morning in federal court in Columbus.

Mohamud’s attorney argues a lengthy prison term isn’t necessary.

Attorney Sam Shamansky says the 25-year-old Mohamud recruited others when he returned home before recognizing “the immoral and illegal nature of terrorist ideology.”

Court documents unsealed earlier this summer show Mohamud pleaded guilty almost two years ago to terrorism charges.

Government prosecutors want a judge to impose a 23-year sentence. They say Mohamud tried to cover up dangerous terrorist activity.

Top India players and international stars will vie for honours when curtains go up on the inaugural edition of the Rs 50 lakh Indian Cue Masters League starting in Ahmedabad on Saturday .

The opening tie of the Cue Slam promises to light up the league as Indian billiards and snooker’s poster boy Pankaj Advani leads Chennai Strikers’ charge against Welsh Wizard Andrew Pagett’s Gujarat Kings.

Delhi Dons will take on Bengaluru Buddies in the other encounter tomorrow. “We have a great team and are confident of going all the

way,” Pagett declared, pointing towards Indian stalwarts: former Asian snooker champion Alok Kumar, Brijesh Damani and

Sourav Kothari.

The presence of three-time European Ladies Team champion Daria Sirotina from Russia makes it a truly formidable combination.

“We have experience and youth on our side. We will take some beating,” Advani, a 16-time world champion, said. “The skill of veteran Dharminder Lilly and Faisal Khan and the energy of Vidya Pillai and Pandu Rangaiah makes it a perfect mix,” he added.

The seven-day league will see five teams — Delhi Dons, Bengaluru Buddies and Hyderabad Hustlers being the other three — fight it out in an enthralling round-robin cum knockout format.

Each tie will have three 6-Red snooker and two 9-Ball pool matches. Each team boasts of five players (1 icon player, 1 female player and 3 men players, with the stipulation that at least three of them are Indians).

“Cue Slam is a great step forward,” Pagett, who endeared himself to the country’s snooker fans by winning the Indian Open in 2015, said.

“It will take the sport to the masses and I am glad to be a part of the home team,” he added.

“India has been waiting for a League like this. I am happy to see that it is taking off, that too with so many top players in fray,” Pankaj said.

The opening day’s second tie between Bengaluru and Delhi is expected to be equally fascinating. Bengaluru Buddies have roped in one of the biggest names in the sport, Darren Morgan, who will be joined by Anastasia Nechaeva from Russia and the Indian trio of Laxman Rawat, Varun Madan and Sandeep Gulati.

Delhi Dons, on the other hand, will be captained by six-time World Snooker and seven-time European Champion Kelly Fisher. The British player has Wales’ Laura Evans and India’s Malkeet Singh, Manan Chandra and Pushpender Singh to muster up a fight for her team.

The Hyderabad Hustlers will launch their campaign against the Gujarat Lions on Sunday.

Rory McIlroy plans to defend FedEx Cup title: Report,"Rory McIlroy took six weeks off after losing in a playoff for the South African Open in January. (Source: AP) Rory McIlroy took six weeks off after losing in a playoff for the South African Open in January. (Source: AP)

Rory McIlroy plans to play again this year after suggesting last week that he might not compete again in 2017 to aid his recovery from a back muscle injury, according to his management group.

McIlroy’s management confirmed in an email that the world number four intends to defend his FedEx Cup title, the BBC reported on Friday. The world number four shot a closing 68 to tie for 22nd in the PGA Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina on Sunday.

“You might not see me until next year,” the 28-year-old, who has not won a major in three years, said at the time. The confirmation from his management followed a tweet from McIlroy announcing details of a competition to play with him in the pro-am before next month’s BMW Championship, the third event in the PGA Tour’s FedExCup playoffs series.

The Northern Irishman won the second playoffs event in 2016 before clinching the $10 million bonus as he topped the standings after winning the season-ending Tour Championship.

This year’s playoffs begin with the Northern Trust event in New York from Aug 24-27 before the Dell Technologies Championship takes place a week later in Boston.

After a week’s break, the series resumes with the BMW Championship in Illinois before the top 30 in the standings advance to the concluding Tour Championship in Atlanta.

McIlroy took six weeks off after losing in a playoff for the South African Open in January, when he first felt the back spasms, which are exacerbated when he plays.

‘Saudi-led coalition responsible for worst cholera outbreak in the world in Yemen’,"An elderly man is treated for suspected cholera infection at a hospital in Sanaa, Yemen. (AP Photo/File) An elderly man is treated for suspected cholera infection at a hospital in Sanaa, Yemen. (AP Photo/File)

The majority of deaths from Yemen’s cholera outbreak have occurred in rebel-controlled areas cut off from supplies due to airstrikes and blockades by a Saudi-led military coalition, according to research published on Friday. The study by London’s Queen Mary University found eight out of 10 cholera deaths took place in regions controlled by Iran-backed Houthi rebels who have fought a two-year war against Saudi-aligned forces backing Yemen’s government.

Yemen is battling against the “world’s worst cholera outbreak”, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

More than half a million people have been infected with cholera since the epidemic began four months ago and almost 2,000 people have died, the WHO said on Monday.

“Saudi-led airstrikes have destroyed vital infrastructure, including hospitals and public water systems, hit civilian areas, and displaced people into crowded and insanitary conditions”, Jonathan Kennedy, Andrew Harmer and David McCoy, the study’s researchers, wrote.

The Saudi ministry for foreign affairs did not immediately respond to written questions or telephone calls.

Yemen’s devastating civil war has pitted a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia against an Iran-backed armed Houthi group, and economic collapse has made it difficult to deal with disease outbreaks such as cholera and mass hunger.

The study compared data from the WHO with maps of government-controlled and rebel-controlled areas.

The researchers found 78 percent of cholera cases and 81 percent of deaths from cholera occurred in Houthi-controlled regions. Only 10.4 per cent of deaths occurred in government-controlled areas.

The researchers said the Saudi-led coalition was responsible for the deadly outbreak, by causing shortages of food, medical supplies, fuel and chlorine, and restricting humanitarian access.

Each day there are more than 5,000 new cases of cholera, which causes acute diarrhoea and dehydration, in Yemen where the health system has collapsed after more than two years of war, according to the WHO.

Cholera, spread by ingestion of food or water tainted with human faeces, can kill within hours if untreated. It has been largely eradicated in developed countries equipped with sanitation systems and water treatment.

Australian men charged with terrorism over mosque fires,"Two of the men are already in custody and awaiting trial on suspicion of plotting bomb attacks in Australia’s second largest city last year. (File Photo) Two of the men are already in custody and awaiting trial on suspicion of plotting bomb attacks in Australia’s second largest city last year. (File Photo)

Australian police have charged three men with committing terrorist acts on suspicion of starting fires at a Shiite Muslim mosque in Melbourne last year, inspired by Islamic State and intending to divide the Muslim community. Two of the men are already in custody and awaiting trial on suspicion of plotting bomb attacks in Australia’s second largest city last year, while a third – a 29-year-old Melbourne man – was arrested late on Saturday. All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment over the arson attack at the Imam Ali Islamic Centre in December 2016.

Australian Federal Police’s counter terrorism national manager said that attacking a place of worship had no place in society. “It is clear that these arson attacks were designed to intimidate and influence those that attend this mosque and the wider Islamic community,” Assistant Commissioner Ian McCartney said on Sunday. Australia, a staunch U.S. ally that has sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, has been on heightened alert since 2014 for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, or their supporters.

While there have been several “lone wolf” attacks, officials say 13 significant plots have been foiled in that time. Police say the three men were adherents of militant Sunni Muslim ideology. Police said the arrest of the man on Saturday came after extensive investigations into fires at the Melbourne mosque – but said it did not relate to any direct threat to the community. The other two men facing charges are in custody and awaiting trial for allegedly planning militant attacks around Christmas Day 2016 in Melbourne. The two, a 25-year-old and a 27-year-old, will also be charged with terrorist offences for causing a previous fire at the Imam Ali Islamic Centre in November 2016.

The man arrested on Saturday will appear in Melbourne Magistrates’ Court on Sunday, while the other two will appear in court on Monday. This month, two men were charged with terror-related offences after authorities disrupted what they described as an Islamic State-inspired plot to bomb an Etihad Airways flight. Another man arrested in relation to the foiled plot was charged with weapons offences and released on bail. A fourth man was released without charge. A gunman in a 2014 Sydney cafe siege boasted about links with Islamic State militants, although no direct ties with the group were established. The gunman and two other people were killed in the siege.

"Punjab CM Amarinder, 31 others get clean chit in Rs 1,144-crore Ludhiana City Centre ‘scam’","As per sources, the Vigilance has given clean chit to CM Captain Amarinder Singh and 31 others booked in the scam. (Express File Photo by Kamleshwar Singh) As per sources, the Vigilance has given clean chit to CM Captain Amarinder Singh and 31 others booked in the scam. (Express File Photo by Kamleshwar Singh)

The Punjab Vigilance Bureau on Saturday filed a closure report in the Rs 1,144-crore alleged Ludhiana city centre scam in the court of sessions judge Gurbir Singh. As per sources, the Vigilance has given clean chit to CM Captain Amarinder Singh and 31 others booked in the scam. The closure report says ‘no evidence’ was found against the accused, said the sources. “The report cites lack of evidence as the basis for clean chit given to Captain and others,” said a source.

The court has fixed the next date of hearing on September 2, and ordered that the defence counsel also be provided copies of the closure report.District attorney Ravinder Abrol said he was not present in the court when the closure report was filed. “I am yet to see the report as I was not present when it was submitted.” Trilok Singh Sood, counsel for Captain Amarinder Singh and other accused, however, confirmed to The Indian Express that the district attorney appearing for the prosecution filed closure report in the court on Saturday. “They have filed closure report under section 173 (8) of CrPC. The court has ordered that we should be provided with copies of the closure report on September 2,” said Sood.

The Vigilance Bureau had filed a chargesheet in the case against 36 persons, including Captain, his son Raninder Singh, son-in-law Raminder Singh, former local bodies minister Chaudhary Jagjit Singh, former Punjab Congress president HS Hanspal and others. They were accused of favouring Delhi-based firm Today Homes for a ‘city center project’ announced by Captain in 2003, during his first tenure as chief minister.

Soon after SAD came to power in 2007, Vigilance registered a case and began a probe in the ‘scam’ alleging that the infrastructure firm received undue benefits of at least Rs 1,144 crore due to the favouritism by Captain and officials of Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT).

In all, 36 people were booked, and charged for offences under sections sections 409 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of value security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (Using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC and under sections of Prevention of Corruption Act.

Of those booked then, four have died, among them former Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) chairman Paramjit Singh Sibia. The Vigilance Bureau had listed 152 witnesses in the case but even after a decade, no charges had been framed, with the matter repeatedly adjourned in the court. The project had taken off in 2006 at a site on Pakhowal road in Ludhiana.

Amarinder claimed it was his ‘dream project’. It was announced that multiplexes, leisure parks, malls and other commercial hubs would be constructed in Ludhiana and overall it would be called ‘City Center’. The construction was stalled after the Akalis came to power, and the site is presently is in ruins.

Spurs agree deal to sign defender Davinson Sanchez from Ajax,"Davinson Sanchez made his senior Colombia debut last November. (Source: AP File) Davinson Sanchez made his senior Colombia debut last November. (Source: AP File)

Tottenham Hotspur are close to making their first signing of the transfer window after agreeing a deal to bring in Ajax Amsterdam centre back Davinson Sanchez on a six-year contract subject to a medical and work permit, the club said on Friday.

British media reported that Tottenham are expected to pay a club record fee of around 42 million pounds ($54.2 million) for the 21-year-old Colombia defender, who scored six goals in 45 games for Ajax last season and was their player of the year.

“I am very excited to be signing for such a famous club as Tottenham Hotspur. I am looking forward to working with (manager) Mauricio Pochettino and the players and meeting everyone there,” said Sanchez, who has signed until 2023.

“It’s a great move for me to come here to develop my career,” he added on the website (www.tottenhamhotspur.com).

The defender joined Ajax in June, 2016 from Colombian club Atletico Nacional, where he made his debut aged 17, and was part of their Copa Libertadores-winning side last year.

Sanchez made his senior Colombia debut last November and has made two appearances for the national side.

The arrival of Davinson will reassure Spurs fans who have expressed concern over the club’s inactivity in the window.

Spurs, who finished runners-up to London rivals Chelsea in the league last season, were the only team in the Premier league yet to make a signing, and have lost England international right back Kyle Walker to rivals Manchester City.

Tottenham beat promoted Newcastle United 2-0 away in their opening league fixture last Sunday and host Chelsea at their temporary Wembley home this Sunday.

"Water supply to be hit in south, west Delhi today","Representational Image Representational Image

With just a few days to Ganesh Chaturthi, people around India are all set to welcome Ganapati Bappa into their homes. And while devotees decide to make the celebrations a grand one, environmental activists and leaders are urging people to opt for eco-friendly Ganeshas. Recently, Union Cabinet Minister for Chemicals, Fertilisers and Parliamentary Affairs Ananthkumar too appealed to citizens to adopt “ECO-GANESHA” idols.

Sharing an important message on Twitter the BJP MP from Bengaluru wrote, “I urge all my fellow citizens to adopt “ECO-GANESHA” idol for this Puja”.

He shared an article by an NGO that highlighted how Lord Ganesha is a “God of nature” and represents several “natural elements”, suggesting that using artificial and harmful ingredients actually would not please the Hindu God.

His tweet garnered a positive response and people lauded him for his initiative.

However, this is not the first time a minister has come forward to highlight the benefits of environment-friendly idols. Last year in an address to the nation on Mann Ki Baat Prime Minister Narendra Modi too urged people to use natural clay idols. Over the period of last two years, several leaders, actors and eminent personalities have tried to remind citizens about their responsibilities towards nature while festive fever grips them.

This year Ganesha idols made of cow-dung is also gaining popularity. Nilesh Tupe, an auditor and chow shelter owner, is selling Ganpati idols made from cow-dung, which he sources from gaushalas in Rajasthan. With rising awareness about eco-friendly Ganeshotsav celebrations, this Nerul-resident is offering devotees a way of going green.

While a 30-year-old art director by profession and artist from Lower Parel last year launched an idol that would grow into a plant once the festival is over, another bakery in Ludhiana had made a Ganesha with chocolate. While the Tree Ganesha was an instant hit with creators reeling under pressure to supply, the chocolate Ganesha idol was to be dissolved in milk once the 10-day festival was over and the milkshake was to be distributed as prasad.

But he is grateful for the dogged fan who travelled half-way around the world to his door — to hear his story.

Peter Handscomb is probably not an option for wicket-keeping duties: Steve Smith,"Former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist had put in a suggestion of handing over the wicketkeeping responsibilities to young Peter Handscomb during the upcoming tour to Bangladesh. (Source: AP) Former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist had put in a suggestion of handing over the wicketkeeping responsibilities to young Peter Handscomb during the upcoming tour to Bangladesh. (Source: AP)

Australian captain Steve Smith has refuted claims of Peter Handscomb being asked to perform the role of a wicketkeeper in the upcoming series against Bangladesh. This was after several reports were swirling stating that Australian think-tank might do so in the quest for an extra spinner on sub continent wickets.

While speaking to the media, when Steve Smith was asked about the possibility, he said, “probably not”. “Matty (Wade), in India, had some good innings without going on to get a big score. His plans were really good and the way he plays spin and adapts is really good, so it would be great if we could have him go on and get a big score. It would be really good for his confidence and his keeping would benefit from that as well.”, Smith added.

“He’s been working really hard, he’s got (newly appointed Bupa Support Team member) Brad Haddin on board now as a fielding coach and someone that he can work with really closely, and he’s going to benefit from that for sure.”

It may be recalled here that former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist had put in a suggestion of handing over the wicketkeeping responsibilities to young Peter Handscomb during the upcoming tour to Bangladesh.

“It’s just about balance and what you think is the right balance to get the Test match victory in the conditions you’re going to. The opportunity to play the extra spin bowler, and if you can do it not necessarily at the cost of one of your seamers or an out-and-out batter, it becomes a realistic proposition.”, he had said.

"Pro Kabaddi 2017: UP Yoddha struggle at home, go down 29-36 against Haryana Steelers","Haryana Steelers steal a win against UP Yoddhas. Haryana Steelers steal a win against UP Yoddhas.

So far, no team has dominated their home leg in this season of Pro Kabaddi as Gujarat Fortunegiants. Telugu Titans and Bengaluru Bulls failed to dominate in their home leg and that trend seems to continue as UP Yoddha are struggling to get going at home. The debutants were brilliant in Ahmedabad and looked like they will be better at home. But it was not to be so.

The Nitin Tomar-led side went down 29-36 against Haryana Steelers. It turned out to be such a tight encounter that the scoreline till the 39th minute saw both the teams tied 29-29. However, it was Vikas Khandola’s brilliance in the last minute that inflicted the all out on UP Yoddha, taking a seven-point lead and turned the game in their favour. Also, with this, one could see the disappointed spectators leave the stadium despite with 40 seconds still remaining in the game.

While Nitin took the blame for their previous loss to U Mumba on himself, but tonight all he could do was to accept that he is not getting the much-needed support from his defenders. “There is a sudden need to work on our defence. We are letting the games slip off in the dying moments. Defenders are getting nervous in the final five minutes. We saw this in our last game too.We need to find a way to score points in do-or-die raids.”

While Nitin and Rishank Devadiga had a quiet night, it was Vikas and Surender Nada who caused most of the damage on the Lucknow-based team. The home side looked in command till the 36th minute before Rishank was taken down giving the Steelers a two-point lead. As the team registered their second win, Haryana coach Rambir Khokhar said this is the first time that the raiders played according to the plan. “Vikas and Wazir Shah played exceptionally well. We knew from the beginning that UP was under pressure.”

During the match, Nada and Haryana coach were not pleased with some of the referee’s decisions. Soon, Rambir was shown a green card for disturbing the game. When asked about the incident, Rambir said, “There are different types of kicks. Mule kick, front kick, side kick. We wanted to take a review but were not allowed to do so. After seeing the highlights, I would say it was Wazir’s mistake. It was a foul! Nevertheless, I am satisfied with today’s performance.”

Nada, who is Haryana’s poster boy in their debut season, brought up his fifth High 5 in as many games. Ahead of the match, Nada had said that Mohit Chhillar and his combination has not been up to the mark. But, after their impressive show against the home team, the 27-year old left-corner specialist said that as senior players Mohit and he should try to spend more time on the mat as they can exert pressure on opponent’s raiders. “We need to make sure that we (Nada, Mohit) both spend more time on the mat,” Nada concluded.

"India vs Sri Lanka, 1st ODI: Rohit Sharma’s dismal run in Sri Lanka continues","Rohit Sharma scored 4 runs in the first ODI against Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters) Rohit Sharma scored 4 runs in the first ODI against Sri Lanka. (Source: Reuters)

Playing his first competitive match since the Champions Trophy 2017 final, Indian opener Rohit Sharma failed to leave a mark as his stay at the crease during the first ODI against Sri Lanka in Dambulla wasn’t a long one. Rohit was sent back in a bizarre manner after a run-out. While trying to complete a run, he had his bat stuck in the ground that prevented the right-handed batsman from completing the run and fielder Chamara Kapugedara’s direct-hit completed the run-out.

Sharma last played for India in Champions Trophy and warmed the bench in Test series against Sri Lanka before getting back in action on Sunday. The right-hander has had a dismal run in the previous ten innings while playing in Sri Lanka as his scoring tally reads 4, 0, 11, 5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4.

Earlier, in the day, Virat Kohli won the toss and elected to bowl first. Sri Lanka started off the proceedings in a decent manner when the openers Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka scored 74 runs for the first wicket and later Dickwella along with Kusal Mendis notched up a partnership of 65 runs for second wicket.

But Sr Lanka’s scoring rate was put to a halt when Kohli introduced spin from both ends. The trio of Yuzvendra Chahal, Axar Patel and Kedar Jadhav shared seven wickets out of the 1 while Patel returned with figures of 3/34 in 10 overs.

The home side eventually managed to score 216 in 43.2 overs before getting bowled out. Former captain Angelo Mathews did provide some resistance to his team but it was never enough to anchor them to a big total.

"Demonetisation has left Maoists, J-K separatists ‘fund starved’: Arun Jaitley","Defence Minister Arun Jaitley. Defence Minister Arun Jaitley.

Demonetisation has left Maoists in many parts of India and separatists in Jammu and Kashmir “fund starved”, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Sunday. He also stated that note-ban has significantly reduced the number of protesters taking part in stone-pelting in the strife-torn region. “Stone pelters used to gather in thousands on the streets of Kashmir before demonetisation was announced, but now not even 25 come together for such agitations,” he said.

“After demonetisation, separatists in Jammu and Kashmir and also Maoists in states like Chhattisgarh have become fund starved,” Jaitley said during a function organised by Mumbai BJP president Ashish Shelar.

Commenting on the benefits of demonetisation, Jaitley reiterated that money which was earlier getting circulated outside the economy has come into the formal banking system.

Regarding BJP’s vision of building a ‘New India’, the Union Minister said the government wants to spend funds on defence, rural development and infrastructure. “We should have world-class public institutions so that shameful incidents such as the Gorakhpur tragedy do not recur,” he added.

Jaitley, who also holds the portfolio of finance ministry, said the Narendra Modi-led government was not satisfied with a 7-7.5 per cent GDP growth rate, adding that the government would continue to take tough decisions in order to boost the country’s growth rate.

He also shed light on several achievements of the BJP-led government, which had completed three years in power. GST rollout, notes ban and amendment to laws related to benami transactions were among the topics he spoke during the function.

Eating chocolate may provide relief from bowel disease,"ThinkStock Images ThinkStock Images

Consuming protein rich foods such as nuts, eggs, seeds, beans, poultry, yogurt, cheese and even chocolates may foster a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment, which could mean relief for people living with abdominal pain and diarrhoea of inflammatory bowel disease, a study has said.

These food items contain an appreciable amounts of tryptophan — an amino acid used in the buildup of proteins — which when fed on mice led to the development of immune cells that foster a tolerant gut, the study said. The findings indicated that a protein rich diet triggers the appearance of immune cells in Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) — a bacterium that normally lives in the gut, and together these promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut immune system.

“We established a link between one bacterial species — Lactobacillus reuteri — that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and development of a population of cells that promote tolerance,” said Marco Colonna, the Robert Rock Belliveau, Professor at the Washington University School of Medicine in St.Louis. “The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had,” Belliveau added.

For the study, published in the journal Science, the team examined mice that had lived under sterile conditions since birth and was germ-free. When L. reuteri was introduced to these mice, the immune cells arose. Further, when tryptophan was doubled in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 per cent.

Humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and have L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tracts. “The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines,” explained Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, Postdoctoral researcher from the varsity.

“High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population,” Cervantes-Barragan said.

Clashes kill two in Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon,"The fighting began on Thursday after a leader of an armed faction sympathetic to the Islamist Badr group fired at the headquarters of a joint security force

comprising the main Palestinian factions. The fighting began on Thursday after a leader of an armed faction sympathetic to the Islamist Badr group fired at the headquarters of a joint security forcecomprising the main Palestinian factions.

Clashes between Palestinian security forces and Sunni Islamists in Ain el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon left two people dead, a Reuters witness said. The fighting began on Thursday after a leader of an armed faction sympathetic to the Islamist Badr group fired at the headquarters of a joint security force

comprising the main Palestinian factions.

In April seven people were killed in clashes in the camp between the Badr group and the joint security force after it deployed there.

The son of the armed group’s leader was killed in Thursday’s clashes and a member of the security forces died from wounds on Friday morning, the Lebanese National News Agency (NNA) said, another eight people were wounded.

The Palestinian security force commander called a ceasefire on Thursday night, but an explosion, accompanied by gunfire, was heard in the camp on Friday afternoon, the witness said.

The joint security force includes Fatah, led by the West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Ain el-Hilweh is located in Sidon, a coastal city south of Beirut.

Lebanon’s Palestinian camps, which date back to the 1948 war between Israel and its Arab neighbours, mainly fall outside the jurisdiction of Lebanese security services. There are some 450,000 Palestinian refugees living in 12 camps in Lebanon.

"Banks stare at union strike on Tuesday, services may be hit","As many as 21 public sector banks control 75 per cent of the total business. (File/Photo) As many as 21 public sector banks control 75 per cent of the total business. (File/Photo)

Services at public sector banks may take a hit on Tuesday as all unions under the aegis of UFBU have threatened to go on strike against the government’s proposed consolidation move besides raising a host of other demands. Most banks have already informed their customers that functioning of branches and offices will be impacted if the strike takes off. Operations at private lenders like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are expected to be normal except delay in cheque clearances.

The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) is an umbrella body of nine unions, including All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW).

“As the conciliation meeting before the Chief Labour Commissioner failed, unions are left with no other option but to go on strike. There was no assurance from the government and the management of banks,” AIBOC General Secretary D T Franco said.

All attempts to hammer out solutions to the demands raised by the unions bore no fruit and hence, UFBU decided to proceed with the proposed strike on August 22, he said.

Other demands include no write-off policy for non-performing assets (NPAs) of corporate loans, declaring wilful default of loans as criminal offence and implementation of recommendations of Parliamentary Committee on recovery of NPAs, AIBEA General Secretary C H Venkatchalam said.

He also suggested that banks should not pass on the burden of corporate NPAs on bank customers by hiking charges.

Venkatchalam said the government should abolish the Banks Board Bureau and ensure stringent measures to recover bad loans and accountability of top executives.

UFBU, which claims membership of nearly 10 lakh across banks, also requested the government for cost reimbursement of demonetisation to banks.

As many as 21 public sector banks control 75 per cent of the total business.

Sebi to chart out long term cyber security plans for markets,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). (File Photo) The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). (File Photo)

Sebi will deliberate with its board members next month on putting in place a long term cyber security framework for markets amid concerns over malicious software script targeting systems and possible data breaches. With technology-based platforms and high speed algorithmic systems becoming key fulcrums for trading activities, the regulatory focus is on bolstering the existing framework and ensure a robust firewall is in place to thwart possible cyber attacks.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) efforts to put in place long term plans for cyber security of the market place also come against the backdrop of exchanges facing technical glitches and spate of suspected cyber attack cases globally, including in India.

In recent months, a raft of dreaded ransomware attacks like WannaCry and Petya have impacted the computer systems worldwide. Sources said a detailed discussion on cyber security issues are expected during the meeting of the Sebi board, which is scheduled for September 18.

The meeting would deliberate on measures that can be initiated for a long term cyber security plan, they added. On July 10, a technical glitch at the country’s largest stock exchange NSE had resulted in halting of trading activities for over three hours.

Already, the regulator has decided to undertake a comprehensive review of technology and systems at all market institutions, including stock exchanges, to safeguard the marketplace from cyber threats and technical glitches. The watchdog has also asked the exchanges and other institutions to keep a constant vigil on cyber threats globally and take lessons to put in place necessary safeguards.

“It was emphasised that there should be prompt and diligent reporting of any technical issues, including cyber attacks, to relevant agencies including CERT-In and Sebi,” the regulator had said after a meeting with stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories in late July. According to the watchdog, Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) should have well laid out change management and standard operating procedures that should encompass all areas related to technology and operations.

Besides the stock exchanges, major MIIs include depositories and clearing corporations. Among others, Sebi has been stressing on the importance of sharing information on instances of technology-related disruptions, cyber threats and attacks among MIIs so as to enhance their situational awareness.

In May, Sebi had set up a high level panel on cyber security to suggest measures to safeguard the capital markets from such attacks.

The committee would advise Sebi in developing and maintaining cyber security and cyber resilience requirements aligned with global best practices and industry standards in accordance with the need of Indian capital market structure. Earlier this month, the NSE and the BSE alerted market entities to guard against a malicious software script that targets critical sectors like energy and finance to steal information from personal computers and passes them on to adversaries outside the country.

The alert came after a communique from National Cyber Security Coordinator regarding a highly suspicious communication being observed on the internet in the country.

"In rare move, US military leaders condemn racism, extremism","The United States’ top general and five of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have bluntly spoken out against white supremacy and bigotry, seen as as a rare veiled criticism of President Donald Trump by the military after his controversial comments about the racist violence in Virginia. “One by one, the US military’s most senior leaders have publicly — and bluntly — repudiated the racist violence that plunged Charlottesville into chaos Saturday, declaring the nation’s armed forces as being unequivocally against hatred,” The Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Trump, just completing seven months in the White House, is under fire for his response to Saturday’s clashes between far-right and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which he blamed “both sides” for the violence. The rally was in protest at the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War.

“You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent,” Trump said. “I thought what happened was a horrible moment for our country, but there are two sides to every story,” he said, triggering a national storm. The backlash over his failure unequivocally to condemn racism and white supremacy, culminated in the dissolution of two key business advisory panels and an avalanche of condemnation from across the political spectrum.

Usually the US top military personnel stay out of domestic politics, American media noted. Joining other military leaders in their condemnation of the violence in Charlottesville, General Joe Dunford, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff said there was no place for “racism and bigotry” in the American military. “I can absolutely and unambiguously tell you that there’s no place for racism and bigotry in the US military or in the United States as a whole,” he told reporters during a visit to Beijing.

Dunford is in China as part of the Trump administration’s effort to drum up support for punitive actions on North Korea for its nuclear provocations. He said that military leaders “were speaking directly to the force and to the American people… to make it clear that that kind of racism and bigotry is not going to stand inside the force… and to remind (the American people) of the values for which we stand in the US military which are reflective of what I believe to be the values of the United States.”

Earlier, the Commandant of the US Marine Corps Gen. Robert B. Neller said, “No place for racial hatred or extremism in @USMC. Our core values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment frame the way Marines live and act.” Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson was the first to issue a tweet on the subject on Saturday, as the protests were ongoing in Charlottesville. “Events in Charlottesville unacceptable and musn’t be tolerated @USNavy for ever stands against intolerance & hatred,” he said. He was joined yesterday by Chief of Staff of the Army, Gen. Mark A. Milley, Air Force Gen. Dave Goldfein and Chief of the National Guard Bureau Joseph Lengyel.

“The Army doesn’t tolerate racism, extremism, or hatred in our ranks. It’s against our Values and everything we’ve stood for since 1775,” Milley tweeted. Milley was adamant that nothing he is saying in his tweet is aimed at being political. “That is the furthest thing from my mind. I am not involved in domestic politics. I want good order and discipline in my ranks.”

None of the statements directly mentioned Trump or his statements on the neo-Nazi marches over the weekend. The military’s five service chiefs had issued firm, forceful statements that stand apart from remarks made by President Trump, who faces deepening criticism for his repeated attempts to evenly distribute blame for clashes between white nationalists and the anti-fascist protesters who showed up to oppose them, the Post commented.

A woman died and 19 were injured when a car, which police said was driven by 20-year-old James Alex Fields of Ohio, a suspected Nazi sympathiser, slammed into people demonstrating along a crowded, narrow street near the University of Virginia. US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Monday that he was “very saddened” by what unfolded in Charlottesville.

Dozen US sailors to be punished for June collision: US Navy,"In this June 18, 2017, file photo, damaged USS Fitzgerald is docked at the US Naval base in Yokosuka, southwest of Tokyo, after colliding with Philippine-flagged container ship ACX Crystal off Japan.

(Source: AP Photo/File)

About a dozen US sailors are expected to face punishment for a collision in June between the USS Fitzgerald and a Philippines cargo ship, including the warship’s commanding officer and other senior leaders of the ship, the Navy said on Thursday. Admiral Bill Moran, deputy chief of naval operations, told reporters the ship’s commanding officer, executive officer and master chief petty officer would be removed from the vessel because “we’ve lost trust and confidence in their ability to lead.”

Moran said that in total close to a dozen sailors would face administrative punishment and left open the possibility for further action. Multiple US and Japanese investigations are underway into how the USS Fitzgerald, a guided missile destroyer, and the much larger ACX Crystal container ship collided in clear weather south of Tokyo Bay in the early hours of June 17.

The Navy also released a report that provided new details of the crash and its aftermath. The collision tore a gash below the Fitzgerald’s waterline, killing seven sailors in what was the greatest loss of life on a US Navy vessel since the USS Cole was bombed in Yemen’s Aden harbor in 2000. The report said the collision at 1:30 am local time sent water pouring into the US warship. “Water on deck,” sailors in a berthing started yelling. “Get out,” they shouted as mattresses, furniture and even an exercise bicycle began to float.

Within 60 seconds, the berthing was completely flooded. More than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped. The last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision. “Lockers were floating past him… at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,” the report said.

Two sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape. “The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,” the report says.

The commanding officer was trapped in his cabin, and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door. “Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,” the report said. The sailors tied themselves together with a belt and rescued the commanding officer, who by this point was hanging from the side of the ship.

Surround space: Parul Sharma’s debut solo presents her worldview through black and white photographs,"One of Parul Sharma’s photographs One of Parul Sharma’s photographs

Introducing the works that comprise her debut solo, photographer Parul Sharma notes that the collection is intended at re-examining the “asymmetry of everydayness”. Clicked from her iPhone, the black-and-white photographs chronicle Sharma’s sojourns in the last couple of years — Mumbai, London, Paris, Kyoto, Tokyo and Delhi — but she prefers to keep the locations discreet. “I don’t like to put anything in a box. I don’t want to hinder the perspective of a person who is trying to establish a connect with my framework based on their ideas and experiences. They should be able to interpret it the way they want, and that is art,” says the former communications professional.

The high ceilings at the imposing Bikaner House in Delhi seem befitting for the display. The 40 frames offer distant and more detailed observations, featuring spiral stairs, abstract compositions and architectural details. If in one frame an empty chair waits for its occupant, in another, the window grill forms patterns on inclined beds. Diagonal lines cut across a frame in a work, while in another, Sharma photographs a street from the hollow of a metal structure.

She shoots the arch of the well-recognised Ministry of Home Affairs building in Delhi, and offers an aerial view of a busy road in Tokyo. Concentric metal nails that fill a white backdrop appear like the cosmic dot or bindu that has inspired numerous Indian artists. It has also attracted the attention of the buyers, with three red dots pasted next to it a day after the exhibition opened.

There are other occasions when Sharma gives viewers a closer glimpse into her surroundings. She places an empty Hibiki whiskey bottle on a pile of magazines on a windowsill at her Delhi home, and plays with light at a Hauz Khas haunt. The black and white medium, she believes, helps her connect deeper with the viewers. “It has a starkness, rawness, and life is largely black, white and grey,” says Sharma.

United States extend Solheim Cup lead over Europe,"Cristie Kerr, 39, helped the cause with a pivotal birdie on the 15th hole that gave her side a 3-up lead with three to play. (Source: Reuters) Cristie Kerr, 39, helped the cause with a pivotal birdie on the 15th hole that gave her side a 3-up lead with three to play. (Source: Reuters)

The United States extended their Solheim Cup advantage to a commanding five points after an impressive afternoon fourball session at Des Moines Golf and Country Club gave them a 10-1/2 to 5-1/2 lead heading into Sunday’s singles matches.

Cristie Kerr, who had earlier passed American captain Juli Inkster for the most Solheim Cup points for the U.S. with 18, teamed with Lexi Thompson on a decisive 4&2 win over Europe’s Catriona Matthew and Georgia Hall.

Kerr, 39, helped the cause with a pivotal birdie on the 15th hole that gave her side a 3-up lead with three to play. Brittany Lincicome and Brittany Lang birdied their first two holes for an advantage they never relinquished as they topped Mel Reid and Carlota Ciganda 2-up.

American duo Paula Creamer and Austin Ernst also captured their match against Karine Icher and Madelene Sagstrom 4&2. Jodi Ewart Shadoff and Anna Nordqvist were the only European side to record a point in the afternoon session.

“Juli did a great job of saying keep it going,” Creamer said of Inkster. “We just stick together and do what we were supposed to do.

“But it’s not over yet.”

The American duo of Kerr and Thompson had got the U.S. off to a winning start on Saturday morning, thrashing Carolina Masson and Jodi Ewart Shadoff 5&3, with Europe winning only one hole.

“She putted amazing today, walked in so many putts,” Thompson said of her partner Kerr. “I just gave her the opportunities and she was just rolling the ball.”

The U.S. won the second match by the same lop-sided margin as Paula Creamer and Austin Ernst outplayed Mel Reid and Emily Pedersen.

Creamer also reached a milestone, passing Inkster as the all-time American points winner in foursomes matches with 8.5 points.

With the Cup slipping away, Europe grabbed a lifeline by winning the final two matches, both by 2&1 margins. Anna Nordqvist and Georgia Hall beat Stacy Lewis and Gerina Piller, while Catriona Matthew and Karine Icher edged Michelle Wie and Danielle Kang.

“I just need to congratulate the U.S. on playing some amazing golf,” European captain Annika Sorenstam said. “I’ve never seen anything like it. We had 35 birdies and one eagle and lost three matches.

“Hope is the last thing that leaves us. And I’m optimistic.”

Barcelona Terror Attack: Minute’s silence observed before England-West Indies Day-Night Test’s second day,"Players observed a minute’s silence. (Source: Reuters) Players observed a minute’s silence. (Source: Reuters)

Before the start of day’s play in Edgbaston, players from England and West Indies and other present at the stadium observed a minute’s silence for the victims of the Barcelona attack that happened on Thursday. Both teams with umpires and other match officials observed the silence on the field.

On Thursday, a deadly terror attack took place in Barcelona that left 13 dead and over 100 injured. Spanish police have not yet identified the driver of a van that ran into people in Barcelona, and are still searching for him, the regional police commander said on Friday.

Many sportspersons have condemned the attacks and said they are shattered by the news. Football stars including Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos tweeted their support for the victims. Indian cricketers Rohit Sharma and Harbhajan Singh also paid their tributes to all those who were affected by the attack.

England and West Indies are playing their first of the two-match Test series. The Edgbaston Test is a day-night affair — the first to be played in the country.

Alastair Cook and Dawid Malan were the overnight batsmen and resumed the second day’s play in Birmingham. Earlier on day one, England made 348 runs for the loss of three wickets. Joe Root made 136 runs becoming the first centurion with the pink ball for England.

Cook also scored a century and ended the day at unbeaten 153. He continued from Thursday and completed his fourth double century in Test cricket on Friday.

Iran: Opposition leader under house arrest since 2011 hospitalised after hunger strike,"The Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) on called on Wednesday for the immediate release of “ailing political leaders”. (Representational image) The Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) on called on Wednesday for the immediate release of “ailing political leaders”. (Representational image)

Mehdi Karroubi, an elderly Iranian opposition leader under house arrest since 2011, was hospitalised on Thursday after starting a hunger strike to support his demand for a public trial, his official website reported. Opposition leaders Karroubi, Mirhossein Mousavi and his wife Zahra Rahnavard have been confined to their homes for six-and-a-half years after calling for rallies in solidarity with pro-democracy uprisings then shaking Arab countries.

They have never been put on trial or publicly charged. Both Karroubi, 80, and Mousavi, 75, suffer from ailments partly associated with their age. Karroubi has been hospitalised twice in recent weeks and underwent heart surgery. Karroubi’s son, Mohammad Taghi Karroubi, confirmed the Sahamnews website report on his Twitter account: “At 1 a.m. Thursday father was sent to hospital due to the hunger strike. Pray a lot”.

Sahamnews quoted the Shi’ite cleric’s wife, Fatemeh Karroubi, as saying that he would refuse “to eat or drink until his demands are met”. Karroubi and Mousavi ran in what became a disputed 2009 election that returned hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power and triggered mass protests ultimately crushed by the elite Revolutionary Guards and its affiliated Basij militia.

Dozens of political activists, lawmakers, journalists and artists have urged pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani to fulfill his campaign promises of getting the opposition leaders freed, but he has been blocked by security and judiciary services that answer only to hardline Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “He does not expect a fair trial but wants it to be public and would respect the verdict,” Karroubi’s wife told Sahamnews on Wednesday.

Karroubi, a former parliament speaker, has also asked for security forces to leave his house, which is under round-the-clock surveillance by the Revolutionary Guards. “He wants the security guards to leave the premises of his house,” Karroubi’s wife told Sahamnews on Wednesday. “Such a level of surveillance has never been seen before or after the (1979 Islamic) revolution … He wants the authorities to announce when they will hold a public trial.”

The Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) on called on Wednesday for the immediate release of “ailing political leaders”. “Karroubi’s life is in danger and the state, which has detained him without trial, is responsible for whatever happens to him while he is in its custody,” CHRI executive director Hadi Ghaemi said.

Duleep Trophy missing from BCCI domestic calendar,"Pink ball was used in Duleep Trophy for the first time in 2016. (Source: PTI) Pink ball was used in Duleep Trophy for the first time in 2016. (Source: PTI)

Struggling to stay relevant, Duleep Trophy has failed to find a place in the final draft of BCCI’s domestic programme for the upcoming season. The tournament had been a premier add to the domestic season for 56 years. The calendar has been approved by BCCI’s acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary, as per a Times of India report.

As per the report, the season begins on October 6 with the Ranji Trophy and will end with the Deodhar Trophy 50 over tournament on March 18, 2018 with a maximum of two weeks separating two tournaments.

The Duleep Trophy was reported to be played with the pink ball and in the same format as last year, Choudhary had said on July 31. The first-class tournament had moved from its traditional inter-zonal format to having three teams – India Blue, India Green and India Red – last season.

“There must be some confusion. It was understood that the tournament will go ahead. Strange that the tournament and fixtures committee has overlooked it,” a member of the technical committee told Times of India on Friday. “This needs to be revisited before the schedule is released,” he added.

The board had shelved the tournament a few years back with the need to test players in the shortest format of the game with an eye on the World T20 in 2016. Last year, Duleep Trophy was squeezed into the calendar in the middle of the monsoon season and played in Greater Noida.

How BCCI does include Duleep Trophy, were it to change their mind, is another challenge. New Zealand A are due to tour India in the middle of September. So finding the top players to play the once-premier tournament would be a tricky task.

US President Donald Trump praised his former chief strategist Steve Bannon on Saturday, thanking him on Twitter for his service and his role in the presidential election campaign against Hillary Clinton. “I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton – it was great! Thanks S,” Trump tweeted. Trump on Friday fired Bannon in the latest White House shake-up.

Trump on Friday fired Bannon in the latest White House shake-up, removing a far-right architect of his 2016 election victory and a driving force behind his nationalist and anti-globalization agenda.

I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton – it was great! Thanks S — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2017

Bannon’s firing, a year and a day after Trump hired him as his campaign chief, put an abrupt end to the rabble-rousing political provocateur’s tumultuous tenure in a White House riven with rivalries and back-stabbing during which he clashed with more-moderate factions.

He was instrumental in some of Trump’s most contentious policy moves including the ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries, abandoning the Paris climate accord, tearing up international trade agreements and cracking down on illegal immigration. He was no friend of the Republican political establishment and was loathed by liberals but was a darling of some of the president’s hard-line conservative supporters.

Border Dispatch,"Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan.

Meena Menon was The Hindu’s correspondent in Islamabad for only nine months (August, 2013 to May, 2014) before she was kicked out. It is astonishing to learn from this memoir of how, in such a short time, her empathetic interest in anything and everything Pakistani enabled her to rise well above routine reporting (and routine harassment) to range across virtually the entire gamut of life as it is actually lived in that “distant neighbour” of ours.

Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. With a keen eye, a sharp ear, an open mind and a large heart, she kept in good cheer whatever the hurdles, made numerous friends, met everyone from top politicians to the proverbial taxi driver, wandered the by-lanes, shopped in different markets, explored the eating places, and did the sights, going to mosques and temples and churches around the capital.

Of course, she filed her regular reports, dutifully attended foreign office briefings, and informed her readers of political events and the proceedings in the National Assembly (Parliament). But she also immersed herself into Pakistan’s rich cultural life, interacted with artistes, painters, writers, social workers, political activists, fellow-journalists, and, of course, the aam admi. Instead of only obsessing over the India-Pakistan relationship, as many Indian reporters and most Indian diplomats do, it was Pakistan as a nation and a society, and Pakistanis as a people, who interested her. And, amusingly, she never allowed her minders, the two security guys who relentlessly trailed her (and whom she nick-named “Beard” and “Chubby”) to faze her or derail her from her purpose.

This is what makes this book so special: it takes in all the political and economic see-saw in Pakistan itself, and in our relationship with Pakistan, but rising above both the pride and the prejudice that often overwhelm our perceptions of that country, she unhesitatingly presents both the warts and the astonishing resilience of a people fighting fierce odds.

“I could walk around,” she writes, “and meet nice people”. “I had many friends and they were always helpful and kind”. She talks of “a senior politician who treated me like his daughter”. “Many parliamentarians were friendly,” she remarks, “even if they made anti-Indian statements.” A startling revelation is that “one place we felt quite welcome was the foreign office”! Elsewhere, she remarks, “this unconditional affection and warmth is overwhelming”. “Pakistani writers and journalists were always accessible” and “helped me understand their country”. She names a whole sheaf of them. She recounts her encounters with the wife of a Pakistani army general, Indu Mitha, who teaches “Bharatanatyam to enthusiastic Pakistanis” and Shenaz Minallah who, despite an attempt to burn down her headquarters, continues to run the Pakistan branch of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s “Art of Living”: “We do courses in mostly three cities and from twenty-odd people the number has swelled to over eighty per session”. There is a moving account of her friendship with the great Sufi singer, Abida Parveen, who says of her hopes for India and Pakistan: “Love is a force, it’s like the sea, it cannot break”. She interviews the Baloch Gandhi, Mama Qadeer, the proximate cause of her expulsion. And she admires Shoaib Sultan Khan, a development activist, “The Man from Pakistan”, who has done outstanding rural development work in Andhra Pradesh. She records, without further comment, Shoaib’s assessment of Rahul Gandhi who was much taken with his work: “this young man has his heart in the right place to do something for the poor”.

She contrasts “most of the media portrayal reinforcing the image of a backward and failed state” with “visitors (who) are pleasantly surprised when they see glimpses of a country that is different from what they think it is.” While surveying the many vicious disabilities to which the minorities are subjected (the Ahmedias are the worst treated, “the community lives on the razor’s edge”) she also finds space for “Pandit Chamanlal from Rawalpindi” asserting, somewhat startlingly, that “the Hindu community was not targeted in any way”.

Yet, she is no starry-eyed romantic. She sees the downside clearly: the “deep state” and its connections to terrorism; the persecution of Baloch dissidents and the atrocities inflicted on them; the blatant misuse of blasphemy laws; the sickening treatment of people with different sexual orientations; the awful collateral damage caused by drones; the soaring crime rate. There are graphic descriptions of suicide bomb blasts in the heart of Islamabad to which she was personal witness; and grim stories of mindless cruelty, murder and mayhem.

Her undiluted admiration is reserved for Pakistani journalists. “Journalists can be shot, kidnapped, threatened and abused…life hung on a thread”. Yet, “journalism in Pakistan has been bold and brave”. She concludes, “The government and the security empire have the upper hand. Yet, with all the powers at their command, they have not crushed the free spirit of the people who write and report at will”.

Meena Menon was unceremoniously thrown out of Pakistan in under a year. She harbours no bitterness. Balanced as ever, she remarks, of herself and the treatment meted out to Pak journalists in India: “there is no low both countries cannot stoop to.” Her final message is: “there is a call for peace and reason, however faint it may be, and it is coming from an invisible majority which is yet to come into its own”.

Spain mourns attack victims as probe zeroes in on imam,"People stand next to candles and flower tributes placed on the ground after a terror attack that killed 14 people and wounded over 120 in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017. Police put up scores of roadblocks across northeast Spain on Sunday in hopes of capturing a fugitive suspect at large following the vehicle attack.

Grief-stricken Barcelona paid homage on Sunday to victims of two terror assaults at a mass in the city’s Sagrada Familia church, as investigators turned their focus to a missing Moroccan imam believed to have radicalised the young attackers. King Felipe, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont led the ceremony mourning the 14 people killed by jihadists who used vehicles to mow down pedestrians in Barcelona’s Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday and in the nearby seaside resort of Cambrils early Friday.

“These have been days of tears, many tears,” said auxiliary bishop Sebastia Taltavull. Outside the church, snipers were posted on rooftops surrounding the landmark building by Gaudi, while heavily armed police stood guard as hundreds of people gathered under grey skies. Catalonia resident Teresa Rodriguez said she had turned up to pray for the victims.

“What happened in Las Ramblas is really hard for us, we go for walks there often, it could have happened to me, my children or anyone. And here we are. It’s huge, huge,” she said as she fought back tears. Later on Sunday, nearly 100,000 people were expected at Barcelona’s Camp Nou stadium for their team’s first game of the season, to be marked by a minute of silence for the victims. Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said on Saturday the cell behind the carnage that also injured 120 had been “dismantled,” although local authorities took a more cautious tone.

Police were still hunting 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub, who media reports say was the driver of a van that smashed into crowds on the popular Las Ramblas boulevard on Thursday, killing 13 people. Hours later, there was a similar assault in the seaside town of Cambrils that left one woman dead. Police shot and killed the five attackers, some of whom were wearing fake explosive belts.

An extensive security operation including roadblocks was mounted overnight across Catalonia. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attacks, believed to be its first in Spain. The terror cell in Spain reportedly comprised at least 12 young men, some of them teenagers. Investigators are seeking to unravel the role of an imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, who is believed to have radicalised many of the youths from a small town called Ripoll, at the foot of the Pyrenees.

Several of the suspects – including Abouyaaqoub – grew up or lived in the town of about 10,000 inhabitants. On Saturday, police raided the imam’s apartment in Ripoll, his flatmate, who would only identify himself as Nourddem, told AFP. Spanish media quoting police sources, said the officers were looking for DNA traces in the apartment to compare with body parts found in an explosion in a home in Alcanar, about 200 kilometres (120 miles) south of Barcelona, where the alleged jihadists were believed to have been building bombs.

"Afghan governor accused of assault, adding woes for Ghani","Afghan President Ashraf Ghani (Source: PTI Photo by Kamal Kishore) Afghan President Ashraf Ghani (Source: PTI Photo by Kamal Kishore)

A powerful Afghan governor is facing accusations he detained and assaulted a political rival in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif this week, the second senior Afghan official to be accused of violence in a year. The fresh allegations add to Afghanistan’s domestic political woes, as President Ashraf Ghani’s government has struggled in the war against Taliban insurgents amid a fractious political arena that includes former warlords with armed followers.

Atta Mohammad Noor, the governor of Balkh province, denies an accusation by provincial council member Asef Mohmand that Noor and his sons abducted him from the Mazar-i-Sharif airport and then assaulted him. Mohmand told reporters one of Noor’s son bit off part of his ear during the beating. A spokesman for Noor called Mohmand’s story a “pure lie”.

The claims come as Vice President Abdul Rashid Dostum remains in Turkey amid unresolved accusations that he ordered his men to abduct, beat, and rape a political rival last year. Noor was among several prominent politicians to form a coalition with Dostum and earlier in August he held a demonstration to call for the “unconditional return” of the vice president. A government delegation has been dispatched to Mazar-i-Sharif to investigate the allegations against Noor, his office said.

On August 9, Mohmand held a press conference in Kabul criticizing Noor for corruption and running personal prisons. When Mohmand returned to Mazar-i-Sharif on Monday, he said he was met by Noor and “dozens of armed men”. Mohmand, appearing at a press conference on Kabul on Thursday with a bandaged head, told reporters that he was taken to Noor’s house where the governor and his sons beat him. “His son came forward and bit my ear as you can see,” Mohmand said. “His second son was punching and kicking me and saying, ‘Now you can see how powerful we are’.” Mohmand said Noor himself stepped on his throat and accused him of trying to conspire against the governor. Noor’s office rejected Mohmand’s account.

“Mohmand was directly taken to the police station and the injuries could have happened during his arrest,” said Muneer Ahmad Farhad, spokesman for the Balkh governor’s office. “He was not taken to the governor’s residence.” Many of Afghanistan’s leaders, including Noor and Dostum, are former warlords who maintain large followings and armed militias. After Ghani was elected in 2014, he removed all of Afghanistan’s 34 provincial governors. Noor, however, refused to leave and has retained his position in Balkh.

Viswanathan Anand finishes ninth in St. Louis Rapid and Blitz Chess,"Viswanathan Anand got seven points in all in the rapid section spread over nine rounds and another seven in the blitz. (Source: File) Viswanathan Anand got seven points in all in the rapid section spread over nine rounds and another seven in the blitz. (Source: File)

Former world champion Viswanathan Anand had another disappointing final day as the Indian finished on ninth spot in the St. Louis Rapid and Blitz Chess tournament, a part of the Grand Chess tour.

Anand got seven points in all in the rapid section spread over nine rounds and another seven in the blitz to end on a combined tally of 14 points in the ten players’ field.

The final day saw Anand winning one game, losing three and drawing the remaining five games. The sole victory in the entire blitz came at the expense of Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia.

This could well mean warning bells for Anand ahead of the world chess cup scheduled in about two week time. The 128-player knockout event will have two classical games in each round, except the final, followed by tiebreak games of shorter duration to determine the winner.

While Anand showed top-form in the classical chess just a week before when he tied for the second spot in the Sinquefield cup, he will really have to sort out the problems he faced here in blitz and rapid section.

That said, one should not forget that the games here were played under the ‘delay’ time control wherein the clock stopped for the stipulated delays and no time was added while the World Cup will have time added to the clocks.

After a super performance in rapid section, there was no stopping Levon Aronian of Armenia who expectedly won the title with a huge three points margin. Continuing from where he had left, Aronian added another six points to his overnight tally of 18.5 to score 24.5 points in all.

Backed by his very impressive performance in the blitz section, Sergey Karjakin of Russia tied for the second place along with American speed-chess-expert Hikaru Nakamura. Both scored an identical 21.5 points to share the honours.

Garry Kasparov finally had a good day as he inched ahead of Anand in the final standings. Kasparov finished with 16 points in all and played some really fine games on what was probably his last outing in competitive chess for another few years at least. The former world champion had come out of retirement after 12 years to play this singular event.

Kasparov said that his comeback was largely to help promote the Grand Chess Tour, and he thought it worked.

Final standings: 1. Levon Aronian (Arm, 24.5); 2-3. Sergey Karjakin (Rus), Hikaru Nakamura (USA) 21.5 each; 4. Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus, 20); 5-7. Lenier Dominguez (Cub), Fabiano Caruana (Usa), Le Quang Leim (Vie) 16.5 each; 8. Garry Kasparov (Rus, 16); 9. V Anand (Ind, 14); 10

Javier Hernandez double in vain as West Ham lose 3-2 against Southampton,"Charlie Austin converted a penalty in stoppage time. (Source: Reuters) Charlie Austin converted a penalty in stoppage time. (Source: Reuters)

converted a penalty in the third minute of stoppage time as Southampton recovered from squandering a two-goal lead to beat 10-man West Ham 3-2 in the English Premier League on Saturday.

A double from striker Javier Hernandez, his first goals since returning to English soccer for this season, looked like earning West Ham an unlikely point at St. Mary’s stadium after teammate Marko Arnautovic was sent off in the 33rd minute for elbowing Jack Stephens in the neck.

At that stage, Southampton was 1-0 ahead through Manolo Gabbiadini, the Saints’ first home goal in the league in 9 hours, 15 minutes. Dusan Tadic doubled the lead from the penalty spot in the 38th after Steven Davis was fouled by Angelo Ogbonna.

Hernandez scored in the 45th and 75th minutes, but West Ham was undone by Pablo Zabaleta’s foul on Maya Yoshida in stoppage time as the Southampton defender stretched to get on the end of a cross into the area.

Austin, on as a substitute, calmly side-footed in the spot kick to consign West Ham to a second straight loss to start the season. The Hammers were beaten at Manchester United 4-0 last weekend.

“When you are running most of the game with 10 men, the penalty decision is harsh,” Hernandez said. “It shows the character of this team that we do not give up.

“I gained motivation and confidence, and happy I scored two, but the result is what stays in your head.”

Hernandez’s first goal was a tap-in after goalkeeper Fraser Forster parried out Michail Antonio’s shot. He produced another predatory finish for his second goal, poking home a rebound after Diafra Sakho’s header came off the post.

“Javier Hernandez is a goal-scorer but he played on the wing in the second half,” West Ham manager Slaven Bilic said. “He didn’t only score goals, he showed enthusiasm and great work.”

Winston Reid injured his calf in the warm-up and was removed from West Ham’s team.

At least two people succumbed to injuries while several others were injured when a man went on a stabbing spree in the city of Turku, even as Finnish police shot and arrested the suspect, according to AFP. The police have taken the man into custody after he was reportedly shot in the leg. Meanwhile, police have warned people to stay away from the scene. There have been no reports of any casualties as of yet. Police in Finland further said that the man who’s in custody is likely to have acted alone, but they are not ruling out the involvement of other people.

The incident was reported from the Puutori-Market Square area. Turku, where the incident took place, is situated in Finland’s southwest and located at least 140 km west of capital Helsinki. Finnish Police have also reinforced security and Helsinki Airport and train stations following the stabbing incident.

Finland’s interior minister said that the security has been stepped up across the country.

Tabloid Ilta-Sanomat says six people were injured, one man and five women, and that a woman with stroller was attacked by a man with a large knife.

MTV3 television reported that police have raised security at Helsinki airport and at train stations. The stabbing spree comes with Europe on high alert a day after drivers slammed into pedestrians in twin attacks in Spain, killing at least 14 people and injuring more than 100 others. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the Barcelona attack.

“The government is following the situation in Turku closely and a police operation is under way,” tweeted Prime Minister Juha Sippila ahead of a cabinet meeting. In 2012, Finland’s then-prime minister Jyrki Katainen escaped a knife attack in Turku while campaigning for municipal elections.

The man who approached him carrying a knife was found to be psychologically disturbed and no charges were brought against him

Day 4 saw Vaani Kapoor, Nargis Fakri and Saiyami Kher as showstoppers, while Wendell Rodricks' plus-size line and Manish Arora's Cosmic Love were a burst of colour.

ANUSHREE REDDY



Nargis Fakri made for a stunning showstopper for Anushree Reddy's Winter Festive 2017 Collection, which draws inspiration and celebrates the life of Princess Niloufer. The beloved princess of Hyderabad and daughter in law of the celebrated Sir Mir Osman Ali Khan, Nizam Of Hyderabad.

Short coats had interesting small lapels, but Sherwanis and a variety of baggy trousers and kurtas were often teamed with lapel coats. Knit Sherwanis, collarless shirts and shawl collar jackets made great fashion statements. (Source: Amit Chakravarty/IndianExpress)

Women’s wear had a gentle, feminine, touch with stark shapes. Asymmetrical, double-breasted coat and dress were simple with machine embroidery; while jumpsuits with side pockets looked comfortable and relaxed. The double-breasted dress with a soft backless coat, grey midi with cowl cover, two-toned kurta, maxi dress with asymmetric cover and rouched back drape proved it was a balanced collection.

DIVYAM MEHTA



When the inspirations for the collection are the draping styles of the Buddhist monks with the multiple layers and interesting waist belts; then the look had to be serene, spiritual and sophisticated. Divyam Mehta’s ‘The Black Monk’ collection at Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 had subtle glamour and drapes that offered a feminine as well as masculine look.

The designer dreamt the collection predominantly in black and cement grey. The effortless styling was interpreted with layered drapes, skirts, and relaxed wide leg monk trousers, an assortment of wraps and robes that exuded easy fluidity. Divyam also took a hint of inspiration from the artworks of French artist Jean Degottex to give a more comprehensive angle to his theme and designs. (Source: Amit Chakravarty/IndianExpress)

The men’s wear started with a fluid kurta and loose trousers, black/ white coat, cropped/crushed shirt and dhoti pants. The low buttoned double-breasted jacket with draped baggy pants was an interesting addition. The cowled waistcoat worn with matching pants and jacket was an unusual version; while the Sherwani/shawl and bundi/kurta combos with asymmetric lapels and the black/white poncho with low-crotch pleated pant further confirmed the theme of the show.

MANISH ARORA



Manish Arora’s Autumn/Winter 2017 collection celebrated his tenth anniversary of showing at Paris Fashion Week that has turned the designer’s name into a global phenomenon. He presented the glitzy, glamorous, collection called ‘Cosmic Love’. Ranveer Singh, known anyway for his quirky sense of fashion, was a perfect fit as Manish's showstopper.

""The line I am bringing to Mumbai is inspired by the tribes of Africa and outer reaches of the cosmos. Having spent 10 years of my working life in Paris after launching my career in Delhi, I have drawn much inspiration from my travels to the work I create,"" said Arora of his collection.

The creations were a visual interplay of colours, styles, intricate silhouettes and designs. Taking the audience on a fast-paced fashion journey from Tribal Africa to Aztec prints that reflected Art Deco touches, Manish created geometrics with patchwork and embroidery. Detailing has always been Manish’s fortè and the designer unleashed stunning velvet appliqués and optical illusion peacock embellishments in gleaming gold and green.

Astrology played a major role for embroidery, as shooting stars and golden sunrays appeared on silk crêpe drawstring dresses and cropped denim jackets. Swarovski crystals looked magnificent for paisleys that were emblazoned on burgundy, tunic dresses or velvet gowns. Colours played a celestial symphony as mustard, tangerine, midnight blue, violet, fuchsia and royal blue turned into the ideal basis for the collection."
US prepared to use force against North Korea: Rex Tillerson,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (Source: File) US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (Source: File)

The United States is prepared to use force against North Korea in the event of a missile launch towards Japan, Guam or South Korea, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said today. Notably, the statement comes a day after US President Donald Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon said there was no military solution to the threat posed by North Korea and its nuclear ambitions, despite the president’s recent pledge to answer further aggression with “fire and fury.”

Speaking at a news conference jointly addressed by US Defence Secretary James Mattis, Japanese Foreign minister Taro Kono and Defence minister Itsunori Onodera, Tillerson said the country was prepared to meet “any eventuality” from the North Koreans, and sought to make it clear that use of the force was not the “preferred pathway” of the US.

“We are prepared, we are prepared militarily, we are prepared with our allies to respond, if that is necessary. That (military) is not our preferred pathway. That’s been made clear as well,” he said.

Defence Secretary Mattis said that the US would take immediate specific actions in the event of a missile launch towards US or its allies. “In the event of a missile launch towards the territory of Japan, Guam, the United States, Korea (South Korea), we would take immediate specific actions to take it down,” Mattis said.

Responding to a question after the ‘two-plus-two’ US-Japan talks, Japanese Defence minister Onodera said that in the event there is an attack on Japan, they will use assets available to them for the missile defence. “But should different circumstances occur, then we will solidify the relation that we have with the US with close communication. We will defend the country, and that is what we discussed today,” he said.

Tillerson said the North Korean regime should engage in diplomatic talks to bring better results, unlike in the past. “So, our effort is to cause them (North Korean regime) to want to engage in talks, but engage in talks with an understanding that these talks will lead to a different conclusion than talks of the past. We will continue that effort diplomatically, first and foremost,” he said.

But, knowing that North Korea sits with a significant capability already within their grasp, I think it is only prudent that they fully understand the consequences, should they make a bad choice for themselves. And, obviously, there are consequences for others as well,” Tillerson added.

According to Onodera, North Korea has plans to launch ballistic missiles to the waters close to Guam. It is also advancing on their efforts to launch ICBM-class ballistic missiles, miniaturising nuclear weapons to warheads. “So for this threat of North Korea, at this meeting we agreed to increase the pressure and to strengthen the alliance’s capability. The four of us confirmed the importance of the unwavering US commitment to extend the deterrence,” he said.

Observing that Japan and South Korea are on the front line against the North Korean threat, Mattis said the US recognises that any confrontation with North Korea would pose an immediate danger to its allies and their populations. “The US-Japan ministerial meeting is a reminder that each nation gains security in concert with other nations. The international community is speaking with one voice. North Korea must stop its dangerous actions as we work to maintain security and denuclearise the Korean peninsula,” he said.

“We are accelerating implementation of the 2015 guidelines for US-Japan defence cooperation and continuing to realign US forces in Japan and Guam. Our militaries are also cooperating in new ways. This includes our emerging cooperation in areas such as space and cyberspace, as well as ballistic missile defence and maritime security,” Mattis said.

“Together, we will deter and if necessary defeat any threat. Any initiation of hostilities will be met with an effective and overwhelming response. Our two nations will demonstrate the strength of our alliance by continuing those bilateral activities and by enhancing cooperation with the Republic of Korea.” he said.

Mattis said that the path of provocations and threats chosen by North Korea was not in the best interests of any nation. “We call on North Korea to choose a better path than one of provocations and threats. Such a path is not in its own best interests nor in the best interests of any other nation,” the Defence Secretary said

"I never felt that Anil Kumble was strict, says Wriddhiman Saha","Wriddhiman Saha was part of India’s team that beat Sri Lanka recently. (Source: Reuters) Wriddhiman Saha was part of India’s team that beat Sri Lanka recently. (Source: Reuters)

India Test wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha has said that contrary to some of his teammates, he did not felt that the former India coach Anil Kumble was “strict.” Kumble had to resign from the post after differences with team India skipper Virat Kohli.

Kumble, who called the relation with Kohli as untenable, resigned in June, just after India’s Champions Trophy 2017 campaign where they lost to Pakistan in the final in England.

“I did not feel that (strict) way. As a coach, he had to be strict in some way or the other. Some have felt he is strict, some have not. I have never felt that way under Anil bhai,” Saha said in Kolkata.

Saha, who returned home from Sri Lanka after the recently concluded Test series, compared the styles of Kumble and current head coach Ravi Shastri.

“Anil bhai always wanted us to score big — 400,500 and 600 and felt that the opponent can be bowled out within 150-200. That’s not always possible,” he said. “Ravi bhai, on the other hand, always tells us to go for the kill. Go out there and hit the opponent out of the park. This is the only difference I could see. Rest, both spoke positive stuff. When Ravi bhai was director, he was aggressive. In his new stint, he seems to have become more involved.”

The 32-year-old praised captain Kohli and said that he is improving with time and he connects with a lot of players in the team.

“He is improving with time and his association with players has increased. We dine together and go for outings together. He is always mingling with us, which I see as a plus point in him,” the Bengal stumper said.

Talking about the Sri Lanka series, he said that the temperament of the hosts was weak from batting point which helped India.

“Their temperament was weak from the batting point of view, which helped us. One session they held fort but we knew they would run out of patience in the next session, that helped,” he said. “That is still three months away. They will prepare well and we have to hold on to our form.”

Saha also thought the combination with Bengal and India teammate Mohammed Shami has been a good one.

“It’s great that Shami is continuing to be aggressive after coming back from injury. It is good for him and the team. He always creates a wicket-taking opportunity.

“He swings the ball and gets the outside edge and I take the catch. We have been doing that for Bengal too,” said Saha.

Video of sexual assault ‘leaked’: Shamli teen dies of burn injuries,"A 17-YEAR-OLD girl, who had on Thursday tried to immolate herself at her residence in Adarsh Mandi area of Shamli, passed away at a hospital in Meerut on Saturday. The girl, allegedly sexually assaulted at a hotel in June by two youths who also made a video of the act, had sustained 80 per cent burns.

Her mother, in a complaint lodged with the police on Thursday, had alleged that her daughter took the step after the accused shared the video with other youths around two weeks ago. Following this, the two youths were booked booked on charges including attempt to rape and abetment of suicide.

Before the girl died in the morning, one of the two youths, also a 17-year-old, was detained and produced before the juvenile board, which sent him to a correction home, said Adarsh Mandi police SHO Raj Kumar Sharma.

In her dying declaration on Saturday, while the girl accused the youths of harassing her by threatening to make the video and photographs public, she did not allege that they tried to rape her, said Shamli SP Ajay Pal.

The SHO added: “We have not found any video clip or photograph in the boy’s cellphone. However, we are sending it for tests in the forensic laboratory to retrieve deleted records. While the accused has not confessed to the crime, several witnesses have told the police that the boys used to harass her.”

“The call details of girl’s cellphone show that the boy in custody used to call her regularly, but she used to disconnect the calls,” said Sharma.

SP Ajay Pal said records of the hotel — where the girl was allegedly sexually assaulted — showed that one of the boys had booked a room there in June. “However, the hotel staff denied the girl was forcibly brought to there,” he added.

Olympic gold medallist Joseph Schooling apologises to Malaysians,"Joseph Schooling (SIN) of Singapore poses with his gold medal. (Reuters) Joseph Schooling (SIN) of Singapore poses with his gold medal. (Reuters)

Singapore’s Olympic champion Joseph Schooling has apologised to Malaysians for saying he was going to teach their swimmers a lesson at the South East Asian Games, which open on Saturday in Kuala Lumpur. The 22-year-old, who won the city-state’s first Olympic gold in the 100 metres butterfly in Rio last year, had told local media it would be “nice to go to Malaysia’s backyard and teach them a thing or two”.

“If I offended anyone, I do apologise… that wasn’t my intention,” Schooling said on his arrival in the Malaysian capital on Saturday.

“I’m really sorry for my comments and I definitely didn’t mean it that way.”

Schooling won nine gold medals at the last SEA Games in Singapore two years ago but will race in fewer events this year.

“I’ll do my best in all of them. I’m just going to do my best and let the outcome speak for itself. We have two days to prepare so hopefully we’ll put on a good performance in the Games,” he added.

“It’s definitely not like training for me. Every race my dad likes to say race fast and that actually holds a lot of ground. There are a lot of great swimmers in the South East Asian region so I gotta be the best as I can to make my country proud.”

The 29th version of the biennial SEA Games continue until August 30.

"Not been invited to Congress’s farmer event, says NCP","Even as the Congress is trying to forge a united front of all the opposition parties for the Assembly elections in the state and have been inviting leaders to a massive “khedut mahasammelan’’ (farmers’ grand convention) it is organising at Pardi in Valsad district on September 1, the NCP on Saturday said that it has not received any such invitation.

“So far, I have not received any invitation. I have also not received any verbal communication in this regard from any Congress leaders,” said state NCP president Jayant Patel.

Asked if he would participate in the sammelan, Patel said that he would decide only after receiving the invitation.

The Congress had an electoral alliance with the NCP in 2007 and 2012 Assembly elections. However, the relations soured after the recent Rajya Sabha elections in which the two NCP MLAs did not vote for Congress nominee Ahmed Patel. The relationship further strained after JD(U) MLA Chhotubhai Vasava said that senior NCP leader Praful Patel had suggested him to vote for the BJP in the Rajya Sabha election.

State Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki said Gujarat in-charge Ashok Gehlot has been told to invite NCP chief Sharad Pawar.

Kashmiri separatist case: Mohammad Aslam Wani sent to jail till August 31,"The ED had issued multiple summonses for his appearance in the case, but he did not present himself before it. (File/Photo) The ED had issued multiple summonses for his appearance in the case, but he did not present himself before it. (File/Photo)

Alleged hawala dealer Mohammad Aslam Wani, arrested in connection with a decade-old money laundering case involving Kashmiri separatist Shabir Shah, was sent on Sunday to judicial custody (JC) by a Delhi court on a plea of the probe agency. Duty Magistrate Jasjeet Kaur allowed the plea of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) after advocate N K Matta, appearing for the investigating agency, submitted that Wani be send to JC. He was remanded in JC till August 31. Thirty-six-year-old Wani was produced before the court on expiry of his two-week custodial interrogation, the maximum the ED could be granted under the law.

He was arrested on August 6 by the ED after a sessions court here had issued an open-ended non-bailable warrant (NBW) against him and sent him to eight-day ED custody. An open-ended NBW, unlike the NBW, does not carry a time limit for its execution.

According to an ED official, Wani was arrested in Srinagar with the help of the state police and later brought to Delhi. The ED had issued multiple summonses for his appearance in the case, but he did not present himself before it. Shabir Shah was arrested by the agency from Srinagar on July 26.

The ED action against the two was in pursuance of an August 2005 case in which the Delhi Police’s Special Cell had arrested Wani. He had allegedly claimed to have passed on Rs 2.25 crore to Shah.

In 2010, a Delhi court had cleared Wani of terror funding charges, but had convicted him under the Arms Act. The ED had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Shah and Wani.

Wani, at the time of his arrest, was allegedly found in possession of Rs 63 lakh received by him through hawala channels from the Middle East, and a large cache of ammunition, on August 26, 2005.

During questioning, he had told the agency that out of that amount, Rs 50 lakh was to be delivered to Shah and Rs 10 lakh to Jaish-e-Mohammad area commander in Srinagar Abu Baqar, and that the rest of it was his commission, it was stated in the FIR.

DGCA notice period norms for pilots many hit expansion plans of carriers: CAPA,"Domestic pilots unions at both private carrier Jet Airways and government-run Air India have already expressed their opposition to the extension in notice period (Source: Thinkstock Image/For representation)\ Domestic pilots unions at both private carrier Jet Airways and government-run Air India have already expressed their opposition to the extension in notice period (Source: Thinkstock Image/For representation)\

New DGCA notice period norms for airline commanders may hit the expansion plans of the domestic carriers besides significantly impacting the entry of potential strategic investors, according to experts.

The new rules, put in place by the aviation regulator last week, make it mandatory for commanding pilots to serve at least one year notice period if they want to quit and join another airline. Before this, a six-months notice period was sufficed for this purpose.

The norms are also facing opposition from some airline unions. The revised norms may not withstand legal scrutiny if challenged in a court, but they can also have major commercial outcome for some market participants, said aviation think-tank CAPA’s South Asia head Kapil Kaul. “This decision (of extending the notice period to one year) will impact expansion, forward planning and increase costs. All the start-up airlines, including possible strategic investors considering entry due to the 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) rule, will be significantly impacted,” Kaul said.

According to the government, domestic scheduled carriers are likely to induct over 384 aircraft in their fleet by March 2020. Currently, the combined fleet of these carriers stands at 490. These airlines will require a good number of pilots -both junior and senior (commanders) pilots – to operate these many planes.

While an airline typically needs 10 pilots per aircraft, most Indian carriers have brought it down to 8. Currently, India has 5,000 trained pilots but industry estimates suggests the requirement will rise to 9,000 in the next two years. “The decision is not based on merit and logic related to demand/supply dynamics and more important, reflects poorly on the institutional functioning at the DGCA,” Kaul said.

With over 7,000 Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) holders looking for jobs, there is no shortage of junior pilots in the market but trained commanders are always in shortage, he said. “CAPA is highly concerned with lack of transparency at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), especially relating to such strategic decisions which can have major commercial outcome for some market participants.”

Kaul said the DGCA’s move was also likely to lead to some form of industrial conflict and tension. Notably, domestic pilots unions at both private carrier Jet Airways and government-run Air India have already expressed their opposition to the extension in notice period “We seriously object to this new rule. We were opposed and we remain opposed to it. We will strongly protest this move along with all pilots from other airlines,” Jet Airways domestic pilots union National Aviators Guild (NAG) President D Balaraman has said.

NAG claims to have more than 1,000 Jet Airways pilots as its members. However, the Air India pilots body, Indian Pilots Guild (IPG), is planning to move court against the decision. An IPG spokesperson said the Guild will challenge the “arbitrary” decision in court this week.

"Just before Rahul Gandhi visit, a waterlogged village prepares","Preparations were on since early morning to welcome the Congress leader on Saturday. Express Preparations were on since early morning to welcome the Congress leader on Saturday. Express

It is 10.30 am. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had just landed at Gorakhpur airport. The five families, who are waiting for him at the house of Brahmadev Yadav — who had lost two children on August 10 at the BRD Medical College and Hospital — in Baghagara village at the city outskirts, were informed that he would reach soon.

Preparations were on since early morning to welcome the Congress leader with four labourers trying to clear the waterlog in front of Yadav’s house.

But they could do nothing about the wet mud as the village had seen severe waterlogging since the start of the monsoon. Soon, they had a idea — mats were brought out from the house to cover the wet mud.

“There is severe waterlogging across the village. Hope the government finds a solution to all this, rather than focusing on just one house,” said Sandhya, a villager.

Soon after, someone informs about a leak in the neighbouring embankment, hardly two kilometres away. This worries the local party leaders and villagers.

However, a few minutes later comes the relief — the leakage has been repaired for the time being.

Twenty minutes past noon, Rahul arrives along with All India Congress Committee general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad, former Union minister RPN Singh, state party president Raj Babbar and party MLAs Ajay Kumar and Aradhna Mishra.

One of the families from Bihar, whose one-month-old child had died on August 11, has also been called.

“I wanted to register a case against the hospital on the day. I even sat on dharna but I was picked up in a police van and left at the railway station with my wife. After much struggle, they gave me the death certificate,” said Manager Rajbhar, who hails from Motipur in Gopalganj area of Bihar.

“Had I known (this would have happened), I would have gone to Patna instead. It’s almost equal distance.”

Rahul assured them all support from the party before moving on to meet three other families in Malaon, Bansgaon and Khajani.

"Man fakes son’s abduction, cops to take action","Representational Image Representational Image

A railway superintendent’s meticulous plan to get out of debt — by faking the kidnapping of his own 21-year-old son — was foiled after police recovered CCTV footage of the “kidnapping”, showing him parking his scooty and walking away. The accused is posted in Shakur Basti in Delhi as a superintendent in railways, said ASI Anoop Singh. Police said the accused was “in debt as he had borrowed a lot of money from his relatives” and had “hatched the plan to get money”.

On Friday, Raghav registered a complaint at Sahibabad police station stating that his son was kidnapped and that he had received a ransom call of Rs 30 lakh. A senior police officer said, “He concocted a story about his son’s disappearance and how he was getting repeated threat calls for ransom.” The police officer added, “He said that the kidnapping had taken place near the Karan Gate police post and that his son was dragged off his scooty by men who arrived in a van and that he was flung into the van and had been driven away.”

On the basis of the complaint, police monitored CCTV footage in the area, which showed an entirely different sequence of events. “There were no signs of abduction,” said the officer.“The probe revealed that the accused had borrowed Rs 30 lakh from his relatives for the construction of his house in Delhi,” he added. An FIR under appropriate IPC sections will be lodged against them for misguiding police and legal action will be initiated, police said.

"Chitrangada Singh, Kalki Koechlin, Radhika Apte turn showstoppers on Day 3 of LFW Winter/Festive 2017","Neha Agarwal presented a fascinating women's wear collection ‘Mithila in Soho’ during Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. The clothes spoke of a raw and bold look in a range of contemporary evening wear inspired by Madhubani Art and Chitrangada Singh looked absolutely stunning in a printed trumpet dress that was daringly revealing yet mesmerisingly beautiful in multi-colours and striking embroidery.



Art works were brought to life by hand embroidery derived from the age-old weaving techniques of Uktu. The collection was a mix of sharp tailoring, blended with conventional fits. Sheath dresses with predominant colourful Madhubani prints caused a sensation on the ramp. Showcasing diversity in their design aesthetics and overall versatility were a range of cropped tops, bell bottoms, tent dresses, palazzos, jumpsuits, skirts and shorts that were teamed with jackets that made the ensembles inventive yet commercial. Detailing such as ribbed collars, panels, plackets and hems along with embroidered prints and knits gave the perfect combination of style, glamour and energy.

For fashion with an artistic palette, a range of stretch, suede and handloom matka silks were merged with studio knitted rayon and silk zari knits. A new fabric was witnessed that seamlessly blended Lycra with Banarasi silk yarns for a young comfortable and modern look. Muted earth tones like indigo, ochre, terracotta, along with warmer hues like chestnut, burgundy and vermillion served as a base for all the garments.

The Indigene label by Ruchi Tripathi and Jaya Bhatt has always been an advocate of sustainable fashion. At Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017, their collection was a nostalgic journey of life, memories and dreams that brought into focus the recreated fabrics, creatively stitched and fashionably patched to perfection, which offered an innovative collection. The fabrics included Khadi silk, cotton and Chanderi, which were either turned into fluid, easy, relaxed, unconventional, silhouettes as well as used in blends or as, patched accents.

The very Zen like look had a mix of traditional as well as western silhouettes. The kedia inspired tops were layered; kimono style shirts looked relaxed, while the drop waist dress was comfort oriented. Pleats appeared for dresses and skirts and the drop- shoulder coats, floppy wide pants and unstructured shapes were layered to perfection.

Launching their menswear line for Winter/Festive 2017 the ensembles stayed true to the brand's identity as shirts, pants and stylish jackets were hand crafted with artisanal fabrics in masculine comfort wear. Menswear matched the look of the collection with loose ombré coats, some pin tucked versions, detailed denim shirts and a profusion of layering. The colour palette was earthy as always, with a predominant entry of indigo followed by charcoal grey, black and asparagus with sharp additions of khaki, alizarin red and icy blue.

Exploring the works of famed artists Paul Cezanne, Pablo Picasso, Amrita Sher Gil along with Matisse and Frieda Kahlo, Rina Singh dreamt up an artistic collection with her label EKA at Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Giving a lyrical title to the collection 'Once Before, an Artist's Wardrobe and Her Story' Rina sent out an utterly, poetic line.

Soft, gentle, layering has always been the leitmotif of EKA, so it was expected that Rina's fabric story had to start with washed and over dyed linen, linen zari, linen wool, and silk blend with metallic yarns. Wool played a major role as merino, blends and boiled block prints versions, along with printed silk forms, as well as herringbone silk wool and jamdaani appeared in light counts. Gathered smocks with tonal embroidery, pea coats, and blousons with discreet gold work, pinafores, front-tied soft coats and low waist dresses made for a nice sight.

Lace played an important role and scalloped hemlines added a delicate touch. The colour palette comprised grey, indigo, crème and charcoal along with nude, washed dower, teal, indigo and blush pink.

Nikita Mhaisalkar with her label named after her, offered a range of flamboyant yet eccentric silhouettes at the 6Degree Studio during Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 and Kalki Koechlin made for a lovely muse. The actor looked amazing in a lined long white top, sheer pants with shimmer detailing of taar embroidery and a long white coat.



The collection drew heavily from outerwear staples with a subtle touch of extravagance. The line with its high-octane creativity was an amalgamation of sweaters, cloaks, organza and woven pants, knitted sarees, coats and trenches with custom made flat knits and ribs, creating a mélange of abstract and amorphous shapes. The striped shimmer detailings gave the garments a visually stunning appeal.

Sharply tailored separates in premium suiting, rich silks and sheer organza made the garments enticing and glamorous. When it came to choosing the colour palette, Nikita was partial to steel, slate and charcoal that were contrasted by the vibrant tangerine, which made the ensembles, look classic and artsy. Long, fluid, silhouettes were the highlight of the line. The addition of the trompe l'oeil print added texture to the lyrical, stylish line of clothes. Keeping embellishments to a minimum, the traditional baadla—taar embroidery gave the silhouettes a modern twist with Indian sensibilities.

The collection by Sayantan Sarkar called ‘Children of War’ was inspired by Enyo the Goddess of War in Greek Mythology. Aimed at the strong men and women who value equality in life and enjoy winning life’s battles, the line was both structured and fluid to match the theme. Bringing in a mix of men’s and women’s wear, Sayantan offered fashionable contrasts when constructed jackets and flowing silhouettes merged seamlessly on the catwalk. With unique fabric development being Sayantan’s specialty, there were innovative blends of handlooms that featured Khadi/zari mélanges along with striking ikat checks.

Women’s wear had a marked androgynous touch with cropped militarised shirts, angular regimental jackets and knee length shirts with four patched pockets and impressive buttons. Layered asymmetric skirts and sharply cut trousers complemented the look.

Menswear was more martial and started with a multi-pocket boiler suit, some stylish double-breasted jackets sporting shoulder epaulets and jackets with 4-pocket interest.

Inspired by the frescos from the 30 Ajanta caves Gaurang Shah presented his magnificent ‘Chitravali’ collection. Using the frescos as hand-painted Kalamkari on Kanchipuram silk; Gaurang blended the beauty of these two traditional mediums. Opting for natural dyes obtained from the bark flower and root, the final result was a kaleidoscope of red from pomegranate seeds, yellow from harde, blue from indigo, black by blending iron and jaggery green by fusing indigo and myno balan for the magnificent colour story.

The prints recreated the fresco scenes along with images of birds, beasts and bejewelled animas. The Kalamkari technique was incorporated cleverly on the brightly coloured Kanchipuram silk brocades with the glittering golden borders whose richness was further enhanced by using the Korvai weaving technique ideal for festive wear. The collection of luxurious saris with stunning gold borders and pallavs painted with the intricate Kalamkari images were breath-taking in their beauty. (Express photo by Amit Chakravarty)

From floor skimming anarkalis, to short kedia blouses, pants, long lean kurtas, the collection moved to multi-pleated lehengas, shararas, ornate dupattas and empire line swirling kurtas. (Express photo by Amit Chakravarty)

Inspired by the beautiful Princesses of India who loved to innovate with the saris, Sailesh Singhania paid tribute to their beauty with ‘The Winter Rose’ collection at Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Radhika Apte glided down the ramp in a yellow/gold brocade lehenga teamed with a blouse and a flowing cape.



Sailesh's muse the Princesses’ persona urged him to unveil the most opulent hand-woven silk saris and lehengas. The lovingly woven motifs were a mesmerising array of roses, whimsical chandeliers, teapots and cups as well as the iconic design of the jewelled brooch and Hyderabad iconography.

Pushing his creativity to the limits, Sailesh ensured that the beauty of hand woven textiles and hand weaves was at the optimum level. The colours were at their vibrant best as orange, royal purple, fuchsia pink and emerald green were fused with stunning gold zari work. It was the recreation of the Raj era when fashion was elegant and stylish. Women looked like princesses when they were dressed in the opulent saris and grand accessories.

While the saris were splendid in their weaves and designs, the ensembles with a marked western influence featured stylish overcoats, trench and pea coats with high collars being their focal point. Sailesh ensured that his coats matched beautifully with the regal saris; while the cropped jackets, some with peplums and notched lapels or double breasted; looked elegant with the saris as well as the luxurious lehengas. The hooded floor length cape and brocade sari was a perfect royal ensemble.

There was a strong, social, cultural and environmental message from Urvashi Joneja’s ‘Concrete’ collection at Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Varying aspects of progress inspired the prints and textures and Sarah Jane Dias made for a pretty picture in one of her designs.

The building blocks, staircases and wrecking of the environment were adequately highlighted through the garments. The look created by Lakmé Makeup Expert, Donald Simrock, had a bold metallic purple touch to it.

The silhouettes ranged from off-shoulder tops, long jackets, asymmetrical peplum blouses, long flowing dresses and midis with plunging necklines and ruffle detailing. The outfits had 3D embellished flowers surfaced innovatively and vibrant prints depicted fun and modernity. The colour palette was playful and pleasant; it had shades of magenta, military green, teal, tangerine, Marsala and a hint of monochrome.

Caprese in collaboration with Jodi Life presented the 'Dress Like a Girl' collection at Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Rhea Chakraborty sashayed down the ramp in a printed back tie-up dress and a striking pink shoulder bag.

Designers, Gauri Verma and Karina Laungani, creators of ‘Jodi Life’ dreamt up perfect wardrobe options using the local Indian craft techniques, which is their trademark for 100 per cent natural Indian textiles with hand block printing. Opening with a white cold-shoulder midi piped in red with detailing, the fun show progressed to cropped blouses with slashed Capri pants. Summer dresses, drop-shoulder checked frocks, striped checked ‘A’ line entry and a railroad multi-striped shirtdress gave the collection a fashionable vibe.

Sahil Aneja, a bespoke men’s wear designer, has carved a niche for himself by reinventing fashion norms for Indian men. His collection ‘Restricted 2.0’ was what the modern Indian needs for the coming season. The designer presented a minimal, chic line influenced by street signs that were intelligently projected on the garments. The ensembles varied from classic suits to well-tailored outfits. Jackets, leather vests with metallic zipper detailing, over-coats and long shirts with cowls had slogans printed creatively. This complete package of creativity definitely upgraded the style quotient of this collection.

Interesting fabrics such as flannel, leather, felt wool and knits were used to create variations with textures to show a different dimension. Charcoal black, smoke grey, maroon, olive and mint green, scarlet and violet created the perfect palette.

Vasundhara Mantri's Reverence jewellery collection was a study in dynamic art forms that will appeal to women who long for statement pieces. With the Indian origin flowers as her inspiration, the designer created mind-boggling pieces that had a timeless appeal and would definitely turn into unforgettable heirlooms.

Intricate detailing was the focal point of the earrings; necklaces and rings; while clever textures and finishes gave the jewellery a striking desirable imagery. The jewellery made of mixed metal with rhodium plating was golden, silver and lacquer. Flowers chosen were tube roses, marigolds, hibiscuses, roses, closed lotuses and small buds; all turned into beautiful innovative pieces."
Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro blasts maestro Gustavo Dudamel for speaking out,"Maduro has angrily blasted Venezuela’s classical music maestro Gustavo Dudamel,accusing his one-time supporter of being duped into criticising the government.

President Nicolas Maduro has angrily blasted Venezuela’s classical music maestro Gustavo Dudamel,accusing his one-time supporter of being duped into criticising the government that has for years been one of his biggest promoters. “I hope God forgives you,” Maduro said in a televised appearance yesterday, swiping at the Venezuelan-born conductor for roving around Madrid and Los Angeles while his compatriots build a revolution that he once helped glamorise.

“Welcome to politics, Gustavo Dudamel. But act with ethics, and don’t let yourself be deceived into attacking the architects of this beautiful movement of young boys and girls,” the socialist leader said. Maduro was referring to Dudamel’s longtime association with Venezuela’s world-famous El Sistema musical education program. Dudamel, 36, began studying music as a child in El Sistema and has continued to tour with its ensembles the world over even after becoming the Los Angeles Philharmonic’s musical director a decade ago. But he joined a growing cadre of internationally-known Venezuelan athletes and celebrities and publicly broke with the government in May after a member of El Sistema was killed amid a wave of protests that went on to kill more than 120 people.

In an online essay titled “I Raise My Voice,” Dudamelurged Maduro to reduce political tensions by listening to instead of cracking down on youth protesters. In July, he went further, calling on Maduro to scrap his plans to rewrite the constitution, a move condemned by dozens of foreign governments as an illegitimate power grab. “Our country urgently needs to lay the foundation for a democratic order that guarantees social peace, security and a prosperous future for our sons and daughters,” he wrote in a column published in the New York Times. Maduro’s rebuke comes as Dudamel is scheduled next month to conduct the National Youth Orchestra of Venezuela in a four-city US tour concerts that may now be in doubt as his relations with the Maduro government sour.

Last month, on the eve of the elections for the questioned constitutional assembly, Dudamel and the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra abruptly canceled a series of shows in Colombia’s capital, citing unspecified logistical problems. There was no immediate response by Dudamel to Maduro’s criticisms. The world-famous El Sistema, created more than four decades ago, is one of the rare institutions to have survived even thriving under the 17 years of socialist rule. The program connects about 400,000 Venezuelan children, many of them poor, with classical music, and has been emulated by music educators in dozens of countries. While Maduro seemed betrayed, his opponents and fellow classical music performers appear in no mood to embrace Dudamel, who they’ve long accused of being too cozy with the increasingly autocratic leader.

"India beat Mauritius 2-1, continue winning streak","Robin Singh scored the important equaliser for India. (Source: PTI) Robin Singh scored the important equaliser for India. (Source: PTI)

Forwards Robin Singh and Balwant Singh struck on either side of the break as India beat 160th ranked Mauritius 2-1 in their opening encounter of the AIFF Tri-Nation Football tournament, in Mumbai on Saturday.

The tournament is being seen as a preparatory one for upcoming Asian Cup Qualifiers against Macau and the home team had to sweat more than they would have expected against a team ranked 63 places below in the FIFA rankings.

This was the ninth win on trot for the 97th ranked senior national team that had a host of U-23 players introduced by coach Stephen Constantine, keeping an eye on the future.

Sandesh Jhingan leading the team for the first time was in for a shock when Mervyn Jocelyn’s powerful right-footer deflected off Anas Edathodika with veteran custodian Subrata Paul completely wrong footed. It was the 15th minute of the match.

However in the 37th minute, a defence splitting through pass from Rowllin Borges found Robin Singh wide open on the left. The centre forward sped past defender Louis Dorza before unleashing an angular left-footer beating the goalkeeper.

The winner in the 62nd minute from Balwant was a result of a three-touch move. Central midfielder Eugensen Lyngdoh sent on into attacking third where Jeje Lalpheklhua’s deft touch opened wide space down the middle for Balwant.

The former Mohun Bagan forward neatly placed it past the goalkeeper to get the lead for the hosts.

The other attempt worth remembering was from youth international Manveer Singh, who cleverly tried a 30-yard shot finding the rival goalkeeper out of charge. It went inches above the bar but the U-23 international on his debut showed why he is so highly rated in the football circles.

Constantine tried a lotof players replacing Subrata with Amrinder Singh in the second half. Amrinder made a few reflex saves towards the end of the match. India will now take on St Kitts and Nevis on August 25.

Antonio Conte laughs off Diego Costa’s ‘criminal’ comments; calls the striker ‘past’,"Antonio Conte laughed off Diego Costa’s ‘criminal’ comments. Antonio Conte laughed off Diego Costa’s ‘criminal’ comments.

Chelsea manager Antonio Conte on Friday responded to Diego Costa’s accusation that the Premier League reigning champions were treating him like a criminal. Conte said that the striker is ‘the past’ and everybody in the club knows exactly what happened.

In an interview to Daily Mail, Costa had said, “They want me to be there training with the reserves. I wouldn’t be allowed access to the first-team dressing room and I would have no contact at all with the guys. I’m not a criminal! I don’t think it is fair after all I have done to be treated like that.”

To that, the manager laughed it off saying, “It’s great. I prefer to laugh. I can tell you that everyone who was in Chelsea knows very well what happened last season with Diego. It’s funny, this interview.”

“I’m not interested to continue this issue. I repeat: for me, it is the past. Stop.”

Costa had alleged that the club wants him to train with the reserves after Conte had told him in a text message that he will not be playing for the club this season. The Spaniard has expressed his desire to return to his former club Atletico Madrid.

The 28-year old had joined Chelsea in 2014 for 32 million pounds ($41.2 million) on a five-year deal. He has won two Premier League titles in three years at Chelsea, scoring 59 goals in 120 appearances in all competitions.

Novel approach to track HIV infection found,"The findings could lead to the development of novel therapies for HIV prevention and treatment by providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of HIV’s lifecycle. (Source: Thinkstock Images) The findings could lead to the development of novel therapies for HIV prevention and treatment by providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of HIV’s lifecycle. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Scientists have developed a novel method of tracking HIV infection which could help develop new therapies for prevention and treatment of the disease.

The approach allows the behaviour of individual virions -infectious particles – to be connected to infection, researchers said.

“This approach – and the ability to say ‘that virion infected that cell’ – will help bring clarity to the field,” said principal investigator Thomas Hope, a professor at Northwestern University in the US.

“It allows us to understand what the virus really needs to do to infect a cell. It gives us new details, like where in the cell it happens and the timing of specific events. The more we know about the virus, the better our chances are to stop it,” Hope said.

The findings could lead to the development of novel therapies for HIV prevention and treatment by providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of HIV’s lifecycle.

During the course of infection, HIV fuses onto a target immune cell and delivers its capsid – a cone that holds the genetic material of the virus – into the cell’s cytoplasm.

From there, the capsid disassembles through a process called “uncoating,” which is crucial to the synthesis of viral DNA from its RNA genome and the hijacking of the cell’s functions.

In the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists used a novel live-cell fluorescent imaging system that allowed them for the first time to identify individual particles associated with infection.

They utilised the approach to monitor how the HIV capsid uncoats in the cell at the individual particle level. They demonstrated that uncoating leading to infection occurs early in the cytoplasm, around 30 minutes after cell fusion.

The finding is just one example of novel discoveries about HIV that might now be possible with the imaging system.

“Being able to connect infectivity of individual particles and how they behave in the cell to infection -which is what we really care about – is going to have a big impact on the field,” Hope said.

“The system can now be used to resolve other controversies in HIV biology and to determine which potential targets for drug development are most relevant,” he said.

India vs Sri Lanka: Virat Kohli kick-starting auditions for 2019 World Cup,"KL Rahul returns to the ODI team after seven months. Virat Kohli will expect the youngster to replace Yuvraj Singh in the middle order. AP KL Rahul returns to the ODI team after seven months. Virat Kohli will expect the youngster to replace Yuvraj Singh in the middle order. AP

On August 18, 2008, Virat Kohli made his ODI debut at Dambulla International Cricket Stadium, opening the innings alongside Gautam Gambhir and scoring 12 off 22 balls. Exactly nine years down the line and 8,257 ODI runs later, he has returned here as India captain. It was another bilateral series that got faded in the sands of time. The upcoming five-match series that commences at this picturesque venue on Sunday will also be forgotten — unless you are a cricket nerd, or the series offers something long-lasting — as soon as the Aussies arrive in India next month.

To cut down meaningless bilateral series, the ICC drew up proposals of introducing an ODI league from 2019, with 13 nations playing. Under the proposal, each team will play a three-match series, home or away, against every other opponent over a three-year period. Then, a play-off series will determine the overall winner. The global body of the game feels that the revamp will give the ODIs a sense of purpose.

About the India-Sri Lanka series, there could be an argument that this is India’s first step towards the 2019 World Cup preparations. Only recently, chief selector MSK Prasad spoke about planning things with an eye on the next World Cup. At the pre-match press conference here on Saturday, Kohli, too, stressed on giving players “certain roles to get into the groove and understand” what the team needs.

All said and done, the next 50-over World Cup is still about 22 months away, long enough in Indian cricket’s context to formulate a concrete plan. Who would have foreseen Yuvraj Singh and Ashish Nehra’s return to the fold before the last year’s World T20! They were batting and fast-bowling quick fixes, plucked out from international recluse. Similarly, one never knows if situation and circumstances will demand Harbhajan Singh’s recall, for example, before the 2019 World Cup. The tournament is still a long way away. So this five-match series is perhaps more important from individuals’ perspectives; about settling into new roles, cementing the places and so on.

Take the case of KL Rahul, who has returned to the ODI squad after a seven-month lay-off because of a shoulder injury. Prasad had said he would bat at No. 4. Kohli said on Saturday that Rahul “will definitely be playing in the middle order”. So apparently, he is Yuvraj Singh’s replacement in the side, although not yet a proven performer at this level, with just six matches under his belt.

Manish Pandey is another one to return from an injury. A side strain suffered during the IPL saw the Karnataka batsman miss the Champions Trophy. This series offers the 27-year-old an opportunity to give a proper direction to his stop-start international career so far. After scoring a match-winning 104 not out against Australia in January 2016, Pandey had faded gradually. Injuries played a part. For Pandey, who is back to top-flight after an impressive performance with India ‘A’, the series becomes important in terms of cementing his place in the middle-order.

Then again, what lies in store for Kedar Jadhav, who can be a game-changer down the order — his 26-ball 40 against the West Indies at North Sound was the latest example. He also has a knack of providing breakthroughs with his part-time off-spin. Jadhav scores at a strike-rate of over 123 in ODIs. “All three guys (Rahul, Pandey and Jadhav) will have to compete for two spots in the middle-order. There are no guarantees I would say, as long as there is healthy competition, everyone will keep pushing each other, and that is only healthy for Indian cricket,” Kohli said.

Eyes on Dhoni

India’s return to full strength, batting-wise, creates little scope for MS Dhoni to move up the order and set up his innings before throwing the kitchen sink. He likes it that way of late, with his finishing skills seemingly on the wane. Though, the former skipper was practising lofted shots at the nets today, hitting back-to-back sixes off two net bowlers before Kuldeep Yadav cramped him for room with a chinaman.

It’s debatable whether Dhoni will carry the extra burden of Prasad’s comment: “if he is not (delivering), we will have to look at alternatives”. But certainly, the great man regaining his finishing mojo will be good for the team.

Rahul and Pandey’s return has once again put Ajinkya Rahane down in the pecking order. He has lost his vice-captaincy for not being a playing XI regular. Kohli explained his situation at length — that India can’t do away with the Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan opening combination at the moment, and at this stage the Mumbai batsman is “the third opener in the team”. This is despite the fact that Rahane scored 336 runs in five matches in West Indies, opening the innings, and bagged the Man of the Series award. Kohli admitted that for someone like Rahane it’s always carrying some pressure to the crease. “I’m sure there’s always pressure on every player that plays, but more so, on someone like Jinks when he goes out to bat in the shorter formats. I think any format if you have any kind of desperation or urge to cement your place or perform, so as to say, there is always going to be a bit of pressure on you,” the skipper said.

Being the third opener, however, gives Rahane some sort of assurance about being in the scheme of things. Given that India will play a lot of cricket outside the subcontinent in the next one year and a half, Rahane’s sound technique and his proven record overseas will keep him in contention.

For the bowlers also, this series is a lot about personal success, along with achieving collective goals. Especially in the spin-bowling department, India have two greenhorns in Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal. Given R Ashwin’s inconsistency in the shorter formats, a couple of places (Ravindra Jadeja is an automatic pick in big tournaments) could be up for grabs going ahead. India will play two spinners in the first ODI and Yadav might edge Chahal, based on his performance in West Indies, to partner Axar Patel. But the team management’s desire to groom a wrist spinner is expected to give both Yadav and Chahal fair amount of opportunities in the near future. “… having wrist spinners in the team is always an advantage,” Kohli said.

LFW Winter/Festive 2017 Day 4: Elli Avram turns into a gorgeous bride for designer Manoj Agarrwal,"The bespoke bridal wear designer, Manoj Agarrwal composed an iconic collection that was authentic and rich in heritage at Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017. Elli Avram turned into a gorgeous bride in her all-red, embroidered, lehenga with a long embellished trail and well draped dupatta.



The line was tastefully constructed, in order to impersonate the elegance of an authoritative historical figure as impactful as Jodhaa Bai. Royal architecture played a pivotal role in the design process of the garments.

He made the audience time travel to the grand era of the Rajputs and the Mughals, who were known for their extravagant lives and effortlessly delivered, a stunning bridal wear collection on the runway.

Subtle embroidery motifs in pastel hues were seen on a palette of crimson, ink blue and brown that looked ravishing. Raw silk and tulle were used to create the ambitious ethnic attires that elevated the appeal of the imperial theme. The designer took an important piece of history and artistically transformed it with the magic of his craft.

At the Johnnie Walker – The Journey show, Asa Kazingmei made fashion lovers in the audience applaud his amazing creativity. ""Inspired by ancient warriors with metal punk as the main focus and a touch of modern culture, my collection this season shows strength and courage of individuals through various aspects in their life. The outfits portray glamour and power and the message is to strive harder every day to be more. Our Johnnie Walker inspired collection is an extension of my belief that like the striding man, every individual must keep walking through whatever hardships come across our path,"" said Asa.



Ali Fazal walked the ramp for the designer.

Asa has always presented fearless fashion and this season he brought ‘Invincible’ haute couture with his customary strong, styling, elements. For the designer, fashion has to be beyond simplicity so the mix of ancient warriors’ influences and contemporary punk culture made a dramatic, emphatic, style statement on the ramp. Asa worked only with a fabric base that comprised leather and denim but detailing was once again with the intelligent use of metal work that featured chains, spikes and fringes. The sharply cut garments in myriad silhouettes offered structural cuts, detailing and were further enhanced with clever embroidery.

Ending the show was the ‘true blue warrior’ Vidyut Jamwal, whose leather /denim jacket, multi pocket pant with zippered detailing and vest proved that he was all ready to fight it out. And that is just what the Commando actor did on the ramp! He demonstrated his expertise with two swords in a perfect warrior like demeanour.

Shreeya Somaiya's collection was inspired by Carine Roitfeld’s CR fashion book on Marie Antoinette. Marie Antoinette, the last queen before the French Revolution was the ultimate risk taker of the time in terms of being bold and edgy. The designer's take was to contemporise and make the fashion wearable for the modern Indian women. The silhouettes had a wide range including Duchess satin slip dresses, asymmetric skirts, jackets and shift dresses in soft pink and crimson with ruffle detailing.

White shirts under denim bustier and jackets, with pearl edging, teamed with a scarlet and pale pink tulle skirts with 3D flowers appliques were other impressive looks. Organza, chiffon and denim were the fabrics used to create innovative textures along with pearl and crystals to reinvent the charm of the astonishing historical figure. The designer improvised the jewels and accessories of that era and infused them as surface ornamentation while floral appliqués were another technique used to add to the ladylike approach to the line.

Making a strong fashion statement with his new colour forecast, Ujjawal Dubey for his label Antar Agni at Lakme Fashion Week Winter/festive 2017 unveiled his ‘Disobedient’ collection for both men and women. Ujjawal’s construction and designing techniques have been his signature that has revolutionised the concept of menswear and womenswear. His new line amalgamated the timeless quality of eastern classic silhouettes with international trends, thus bringing a certain amount of disobedience to his collection.

Menswear had the characteristic asymmetric silhouettes for waist coats and kurtas. Knit sherwanis, collarless shirts and shawl collar jackets made for great fashion statements.

Womenswear had a gentle, feminine, touch with stark shapes. Asymmetrical, double-breasted coat and dress were simple with machine embroidery; while jumpsuits with side pockets looked comfortable and relaxed. The double-breasted dress with a soft backless coat, grey midi with cowl cover, two-toned kurta, maxi dress with asymmetric cover and rouched back drape proved it was a balanced collection.

Delhi based duo Monika and Nidhi brought together a line that was exquisite, yet, experimental in its own way. Pernia Qureshi gracefully walked the ramp in an embellished ivory lehenga with stylised choli that had intricate details. It was the perfect winter wedding outfit for the new age women.

The collection had all the elements for a perfect fairy tale, right from the extravagant ensembles to the fragile embroidery and the vintage style quotient. The silhouettes were an ode to the Victorian era, but a contemporary twist was given to the ballroom skirts teamed with well-tailored corsets, cholis, cropped tops with elongated sleeves and capes with feather and fringe detail along with a metallic sari that sparkled like pixie dust. Waists were cinched to add a more figure-hugging accent to the collection.

Georgette, tulle, organza, satin and crepe were the fabrics chosen to construct this mystical labour of love. Salmon pink, colonial blue, Edwardian vanilla and jade were the hues picked to glorify the narration of tales from the ancient period.

When the inspirations for the collection are the draping styles of the Buddhist monks with the multiple layers and interesting waist belts; then the look has to be serene, spiritual and sophisticated. Divyam Mehta's 'The Black Monk' collection at Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 had subtle glamour. With the collection predominantly in black and cement grey, the effortless styling was interpreted with layered drapes, skirts, and relaxed wide leg monk trousers. Divyam also took a hint of inspiration from the artworks of French artist Jean Degottex to give a more comprehensive angle to his theme and designs.

The delicate Shibori patterns and interesting block prints gave an innovative texturing to the handloom wool and matka silks. But it was the imaginative Kantha work from Bengal and the thread embroidery that finally completed the ethereal look. The menswear started with a fluid kurta and loose trousers, black/ white coat, cropped/crushed shirt and dhoti pants. The low buttoned double-breasted jacket with draped baggy pants was an interesting addition. The cowled waistcoat worn with matching pants and jacket was an unusual version; while the Sherwani/shawl and bundi/kurta combos with asymmetric lapels and the black/white poncho with low-crotch pleated pant further confirmed the theme of the show.

When it comes to the colourful fantasy of digital prints, Ajay Kumar is the master of the genre. For Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017, the designer's 'Bhu-Svah' collection was inspired by the beauty, culture, flora, and fauna of India. The collection brought to the forefront the sustainability of style with the use of natural fabrics."
Gorakhpur a murderous spot: Congress hits back at Yogi Adityanath,"Rahul Gandhi during his visit to Gorakhpur, Saturday. PTI Rahul Gandhi during his visit to Gorakhpur, Saturday. PTI

The Congress on Saturday hit back at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for attacking party vice president Rahul Gandhi over his visit to Gorakhpur. The main Opposition party said the Chief Minister has insulted the “sacred memory” of the children who died at BRD Medical College by reducing the debate to cheap politicking. Responding to the Chief Minister’s assertion that Gorakhpur was not a picnic spot, the Congress said the city was not a “picnic spot”, but “murderous spot”.

“We agree that Gorakhpur is not a picnic spot but instead has been turned into a murderous spot by utter negligence, lack of accountability and total callousness. It is the spot where hundreds of children seem to be dying with the routine and business as usual answer charted out by the Yogi cabinet,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said. Singhvi added that Yogi Adityanath was not just the Chief Minister, but also the MP from Gorakhpur. Read: ‘Yuvraj, shehzada can’t make Gorakhpur picnic spot’: Yogi Adityanath. Click here

“He has insulted the sacred memory of those helpless and poor children who died by reducing the debate to such cheap politicking… I will leave it to the public of India to judge whether in an anxiety to score political points over Rahul Gandhi, has he not reduced this whole serious, terrible and tragic episode to a farce and has post death, grossly insulted the memory of those children,” Singhvi added.

Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar also attacked the Chief Minister, saying his remarks reflected “pettiness” and “panic” over Gandhi’s visit. “The Chief Minister took no action and he wants to divert the issue…he is belittling the position that he holds by such petty statements…Rahulji has come here to share the pain of the poor… but asking why he has come only indicated the pettiness of the Chief Minister,” Babbar said.

Brazil to swap environmental fines for recovery works,"FILE PHOTO: A tow truck helps to remove a soy truck after it crashed and dumped some 30 tons of soybean crops, along Brazilian Federal highway BR-163, near to the city of Sorriso, in the central state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, March 18, 2004.

REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File photo/Representational

Brazil will allow environmental transgressors to exchange millionaire fines for recovery works at a discount, the environment minister said on Thursday, in a bid to reduce litigation and raise funds for projects in times of austerity.

A decree to be published next week will allow environmental offenders such as oil company Petrobras to swap their fines for investments in projects, with a discount of up to 60 percent of the original penalty, minister José Sarney Filho said.

From the 23 billion reais ($7.24 billion) in environmental fines imposed between 2011 and 2016, federal agency Ibama has received just 605 million reais as most transgressors appealed against the penalties in courts, ministry data shows.

State-run oil producer Petróleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, is expected to be one of the first companies applying for the swap, Sarney Filho said. Petrobras could cut its debt with Ibama to about 380 million reais from 950 million if the full discount is applied.

Ibama expects about 4.6 billion reais in investments under the new rules. Brazil’s government has frozen about 45 billion reais in spending this year in order to meet its budget target.

Sarney Filho said the swap will not be available for cases such as the 2015 Samarco disaster, in which the deadly collapse of a tailings dam owned by the mining company killed 19 people, destroyed a village and polluted an interstate river. ($1 = 3.1748 reais)

Served with Love is a typical, I-hate-you-at-first-sight-then fall-in-endless-love story. Set in the kitchen of a plush hotel, the story involves Pakhi, an able sous chef and Abhimanyu Dev, another equally able chief chef — but he’s also a hard taskmaster and the owner of the hotel chain. He’s dated a lot of supermodels but has never committed to anyone. And Pakhi has put her life on hold for her three-year-old orphaned niece.Because, gendered roles y’all. But Cupid strikes anyway. Over ‘vegetable

Because, gendered roles y’all. But Cupid strikes anyway. Over ‘vegetable angaara’, ‘home-made rasmalai’ and a recipe of hot chocolate laced with chilli. Kisses are stolen between hospital visits for an ailing grandfather and Abhimanyu caring for Pakhi’s orphaned niece. There’s a dash of jealousy in the form of a psychotic ex-fiance of Pakhi. But it’s never clear what the two protagonists really like in each other except her “ample” assets, and his “ponytail”.

Plot and character development in this book are competitively cringe-making, and it’s difficult to decide which is the winner. It’s easy to see who isn’t — the reader. Read this if only you wish to expand your knowledge of fancy desserts and how a five-star kitchen functions.

Malaysia apologizes for showing Indonesia’s flag as Poland’s,"Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. (File/Photo) Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. (File/Photo)

Malaysia apologized to Indonesia on Sunday for an “unintentional” mistake in printing the Indonesian flag upside down in a souvenir guidebook for the Southeast Asian Games. The error made the red-and-white Indonesian flag resemble Poland’s and caused anger in Indonesia, where “shameonyoumalaysia” has become the most popular hashtag on Twitter. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo demanded an apology for hurt national pride but also cautioned against exaggerating the incident with his neighbor. The two countries share the same religion and language but often trade accusations of stealing the other’s food and culture.

Malaysian Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin met his Indonesian counterpart Imam Nahrawi to personally apologize. After a brief private meeting Sunday, the two ministers shook hands at a news conference.

Khairy, who was quick to issue the first apology late Saturday on Twitter, said that the guidebooks will be corrected and reprinted.

Indonesia appears to have taken particular offense because the guidebook was distributed to VIPs at Saturday’s opening ceremony in Kuala Lumpur for the 29th Southeast Asian Games and only its flag was shown incorrectly.

Nahrawi, who earlier described the error as “very painful,” said he accepted the apology.

“We hope these mistakes don’t get repeated because flags are important symbols for each country and should be respected,” he said.

Khairy said the mistake was “unintentional and it happened due to our carelessness.”

“This was a big, big mistake. I, on behalf of the host, have conveyed our apologies to … Imam as the Indonesian minister and also I apologize to the people of Indonesia for this mistake,” he said.

The creation of Malaysia when the British empire was dismantled after World War II was bitterly opposed by Indonesia, itself then a new nation emerging from Dutch colonial rule and a short-lived Japanese occupation.

On Twitter, Indonesians said their flag represents the sacrifices of independence heroes and accused Malaysia of either being stupid or deliberately misprinting it.

“You know, this is maybe the reason why our founding father Soekarno wanted to Kick Your Ass,” said one user.

US condemns ‘power grab’ by new Venezuelan assembly,"State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon/Files) State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon/Files)

Condemning the assumption of legislative powers by the “illegitimate” constituent assembly, the US has said the “power grab” is designed to supplant the democratically-elected National Assembly with an authoritarian committee operating above the law.

Venezuela’s new pro-government constitutional authority yesterday formally declared that it was seizing legislative power from the opposition-led legislature, tightening President Nicolas Maduro’s hold on power in defiance of calls for elections. “In our view, the democratically-elected National Assembly is the only legitimate legislative body,” State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said on Friday.

“The United States strongly condemns the assumption of legislative powers by the illegitimate Constituent Assembly.

This power grab is designed to supplant the democratically-elected National Assembly with an authoritarian committee operating above the law,” she said in a statement.

Nauert said the US joins Venezuela’s neighbours in condemning the illegitimate Constituent Assembly and its authoritarian directives. “As long as the Maduro regime continues to conduct itself as an authoritarian dictatorship, we are prepared to bring the full weight of American economic and diplomatic power to bear in support of the Venezuelan people as they seek to restore their democracy,” she said.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio tweeted that destruction of Venezuela’s democracy continues as Maduro’s illegitimate Constituent Assembly seizes democratic National Assembly’s powers.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s first year in office has been tumultuous with only a few faces from his original team now left in the White House. Eight months into his presidency, several close aides have either resigned or been fired, indicating a clear rift within the administration.

Here’s a list of all the people who have either quit or been fired from the White House:

Carl Icahn, billionaire investor and special adviser to Trump resigned on August 18 over a conflict of interest; he was being criticised for making policy recommendations that would help his own investments.

Reince Priebus claimed he resigned privately on July 27 from his post as Chief of Staff after holding several conversations with Trump regarding leaving the White House. The news of his departure, however, broke a day after then communications director Anthony Scaramucci accused Priebus of leaking information to reporters. “The president has a right to hit a reset button. I think it’s time to hit the reset button,” he had said in a televised interview, reported Reuters.

Michael Short, senior assistant press secretary, called it quits on July 25 amid reports of Scaramucci making cuts, reported Fox News.

Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary resigned on July 21 over the appointment of New York financier Anthony Scaramucci as the communications director. The 45-year-old rejected Trump’s offer to stay on, maintaining that the appointment was a mistake.

Mike Dubke tendered his resignation on May 18, around three months after he was appointed communications director. While he provided no reason for his departure, he said, “It has been my great honour to serve President Trump and this administration.”

Michael Flynn resigned from his post as National Security Adviser on February 14 over allegations of ties with Russia. Flynn, who held the post for less than a month, ‘sincerely apologised’ to Trump and Vice-President Mike Spencer for providing them incomplete information about his Russian contacts, namely Russia Ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak.

Following are other senior officials, who are not part of the Trump cabinet, but have resigned after serious differences with the US President:

James Comey was fired as director of the FBI on May 9 by Trump in the backdrop of the investigation of Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. Comey, who took interest in probing the case and had sought increase federal resources for it, was eventually sacked although Trump claimed he was fired due to incompetency.

Preet Bharara, former US Attorney, was fired in March, after Attorney General Jeff Sessions forced the 46 appointees made by the former President to tender their resignations. When he refused, he was shown the door. “I did not resign. Moments ago I was fired,” he had written on Twitter.

Sally Yates, the federal government’s top lawyer, was fired on January 30 after she defied the White House by saying the Justice Department would not defend Trump’s travel restrictions targeting seven Muslim-majority nations. She had argued that the order would not be “consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.”

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s shimmer gown is a beauty but she manages to ruin the look; here’s how,"Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in a Gaurav Gupta gown at Manish Malhotra’s party. (Source: Varinder Chawla) Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in a Gaurav Gupta gown at Manish Malhotra’s party. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is a real beauty and probably that’s the reason why she can pull of almost anything with ease, even if the styling is not really commendable. Such is the case with her latest appearance at Manish Malhotra’s residence where she attended a party organised by the ace designer to celebrate his good friend, Sridevi’s birthday.

The Ae Dil Hai Mushkil star stepped out in a lovely toga-inspired grey shimmer gown by Gaurav Gupta featuring an embellished neckline. If you ask us, the gown ticks all the right boxes for a simple yet elegant evening look and we would have been really happy with her choice for the soirée. But there’s a catch! Celebrity stylist Aastha Sharma who has worked with Aishwarya on a number of occasions, including Cannes 2017 red carpet, spoiled the look with a chainmail necklace. We wish she would have picked up something sleek in its place, it would have looked much better.

However, we can’t find any fault with her beauty game. Her face looked gorgeous as usual with her signature well-defined eyes, a bright red pout and cascading waves.

This isn’t the first time the Indian beauty has ruined her look by going overboard with her styling. A couple of days back, while in Melbourne, Australia, she picked up a beautiful, custom-made embroidered suit by fashion designer Manish Malhotra. We loved her outfit but here too she ruined the look with too much make-up. Only if she would have toned it down a little.

Do you like her style quotient? Let us know in the comments below.

IN A show of strength ahead of the scheduled August 25 verdict by a special CBI court in a rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, hundreds of his followers swarmed the Panchkula Sector 1 district court premises in Panchkula on Saturday, appearing to have taken the police by surprise. Singh is due to appear in the court on judgement day.

On Saturday, his followers, both men and women, began assembling at the district court complex from about 8.30 am and shouted slogans praising him. While many were from Panchkula, others had come from Ambala and some areas of Himachal Pradesh, including Parwanoo and Nalagarh. Many supporters seemed to believe that Singh would appear in court on Saturday as two separate murder cases against him were heard and adjourned to September 16. They gathered in strength both inside and outside the court complex despite the driving rain.

Panchkula police seemed to have no advance intelligence about the gathering. It was only after hundreds had already gathered inside the court that the police belatedly barricaded entry routes to the district court and sealed the entry gate of the Mini Secretariat. At short notice, more than 600 police personnel were called to the district court. Senior officers, including DCP Ashok Kumar, ACP Mukesh Malhotra and SHOs of all police stations rushed to the spot.

Panchkula DCP Ashok Kumar said, “We did not expect the Dera followers to come to Panchkula today. Though not a single Dera follower entered the court building, they managed to come inside the gates of the court complex…. Later, we barricaded all the routes to the district court and stopped them at a distance of 200 metres away from the court complex.”

Sources said senior police officers, including Haryana DGP B S Sandhu, contacted Panchkula DCP Ashok Kumar and sought a report from him on the assembly of Dera followers in such large numbers.

Some of the Dera followers maintained that they would continue to assemble around the district courts complex daily until August 25. A Dera follower said, “Someone passed the information to Dera followers that Dera head, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, is coming to appear in the court today. So, the followers came here to take a look of him.” The followers, including aged people, women and children, arrived in Panchkula in their private vehicles and they stayed around the court complex till 4 pm.

"1 policeman killed, 3 injured in 2 shootings in Florida","In the northern Florida city of Jacksonville, two police officers were shot and wounded while responding to reports of a shooter in an apartment, the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office said. (Source: AP ) In the northern Florida city of Jacksonville, two police officers were shot and wounded while responding to reports of a shooter in an apartment, the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office said. (Source: AP )

One police officer was shot and killed and another gravely injured by gunfire while checking suspicious people in the central Florida city of Kissimmee, police said today.

Three suspects were in custody and a fourth was being sought.

Elsewhere in Florida, two police officers were shot and injured when responding to shots fired in Jacksonville.

Kissimmee police officers Sam Howard and Matthew Baxter were checking suspicious people in an area of the city known for drug activity when they were shot, Kissimmee Police Chief Jeff O’Dell said at a news conference. They did not have an opportunity to return fire.

“They were surprised,” O’Dell said. When asked whether they were ambushed, he said, “It’s too early to tell, but it’s leading that way.”

Baxter, a three-year veteran of the department, died later in a hospital and Howard, a 10-year veteran, was in serious condition, O’Dell said. Both had families, he said.

The officers were checking three suspects when a fourth suspect opened fire. Three of the suspects were arrested, and officers were searching for a fourth.

Broadcaster WFTV showed aerial footage of police cars with lights flashing swarmed at a housing complex as the search continued in Kissimmee, a city just south of the theme park hub of Orlando.

In the northern Florida city of Jacksonville, two police officers were shot and wounded while responding to reports of a shooter in an apartment, the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office said.

Florida Governor Rick Scott sent Tweets about the four officers, saying “we stand with ALL law enforcement in Florida.”

When O’Dell held his brief news conference outside the hospital where the two fallen Kissimee officers had been taken, reports already had surfaced of two more officers shot in Jacksonville to the north.

“It’s a tough time for law enforcement,” O’Dell said of those reports. “It’s getting tough to do the job.”

"US warship Indianapolis found 18,000 feet deep in Pacific Ocean","The World War II cruiser USS Indianapolis which was lost July 30, 1945 is seen at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in 1937. (Source: Reuters) The World War II cruiser USS Indianapolis which was lost July 30, 1945 is seen at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in 1937. (Source: Reuters)

Researchers have found the wreckage of the U.S. warship Indianapolis, which was sunk by a Japanese torpedo in the final days of World War Two, more than 18,000 feet (5.5 kilometers) below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, the Navy said on Saturday. The cruiser was returning from its mission to deliver components for the atomic bomb that would soon be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima when it was fired upon in the North Pacific Ocean by a Japanese submarine on July 30, 1945.

It sunk in 12 minutes, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington. No distress signal was sent. About 800 of the 1,196 crew members aboard survived the sinking, but only 316 were rescued alive five days later, with the rest lost to exposure, dehydration, drowning and sharks.

After a Navy historian unearthed new information in 2016 about the warship’s last movements that pointed to a new search area, a team of civilian researchers led by Paul Allen, a Microsoft Corp co-founder, spent months searching in a 600-square-mile (1,500-square-kilometer) patch of ocean.

With a vessel rigged with equipment that can reach some of the deepest ocean floors, members of Allen’s team found the wreckage somewhere in the Philippine Sea on Friday, Allen said in a statement on his website. The statement said the Navy had asked Allen to keep the precise location confidential.

Allen said that the discovery was a humbling experience and a means of honoring sailors he saw as playing a vital role in ending World War Two. “While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,” he said. Identification was easier than in some deep-sea expeditions: some of the exposed wreck was clearly marked with Indianapolis signage, according to photographs shared by Allen and the Navy.

“It is exceedingly rare you find the name of the ship on a piece of the wreckage,” Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the Naval History and Heritage Command, said in a telephone interview. “If that’s not Indianapolis then I don’t know what is.”

The Navy said it had plans to honor the 22 survivors from the Indianapolis still alive along with the families of the ship’s crew.

Inside Track: Personal property?,"A prestigious periodical wanted to carry a facsimile of the first draft of Pandit Nehru’s famous Tryst with Destiny speech in which India’s first prime minister had made some notes along the margins. The draft was published in the ‘Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru, Volume 3’, for which the Gandhi family holds the copyright. As a formality, the periodical sought permission from the Nehru Memorial Fund, housed in Teen Murti Marg and funded largely by government grants, to reproduce the draft speech to commemorate the 70th year of Independence. However, the publication was informed that they would have to first write a cheque for Rs 10,000 to the family. Surely, the Prime Minister of India’s speech to the Constituent Assembly in August 1947 belongs to the nation and the national archives and is not the personal property of the Gandhi family?

PM and media

Prime Minister Narendra Modi follows the media keenly, especially when the issues concern him. Clearly, he had received an immediate feedback on TV reactions to his Independence Day speech, judging by the informed comments he made to some of the journalists he met at Rashtrapati Bhavan’s ‘At Home’ function the same evening. Speaking to a TV commentator who had questioned his statistics in his Red Fort speech, Modi joked sarcastically that either he needed to take a course in economics or she did. To another editor who is active on Twitter, he remarked that he started receiving his abuses from early in the morning. When a journalist tried to flatter him by praising his August 15 address, Modi responded by saying that when people from all over start praising a speech, that too can be worrying.

Prez’s baraat ghar

An invitation to the President’s At Home tea party on Independence Day has lost some of its charm because of the crass setting. Earlier, the function used to be held at Rashtrapati Bhavan’s well-manicured Rose Gardens or, in case of rain, in the majestic Darbar Hall. It is now held in the Ceremonial Hall of the Culture Centre in the Rashtrapati Bhavan compound. This modern monstrosity was built during President Pranab Mukherjee’s tenure and resembles a large wedding banquet hall. Instead of replicating the gracious columns, high ceilings and tasteful but muted décor of the Lutyens building, the new hall is ablaze with lights, including an enormous, glittering chandelier and dozens of bulbs embedded in the ceiling. The curtains are green and the walls yellow and the doors and pillars not in conformity with the carefully conceived original concept.

Tell-tale ballots

The NCP is still trying to keep up the pretence that Jayant Patel (known generally as Bosky), one of its two MLAs, had voted for Ahmed Patel in the Gujarat Rajya Sabha election. Surprisingly, BJP leaders back the NCP’s dubious claim. The Congress knows better. Bosky’s ballot paper was a giveaway. In the mock voting practice runs carried out by the Congress, it was noticed that Bosky was the only MLA who always used the English numeral 1 to mark his first preference vote instead of the Gujarati numerals that other MLAs used. When the ballot box was opened, only one ballot had the English numeral and it gave the first preference to the BJP’s Balwantsinh Rajput. Similarly, the JD(U)’s Chhotu Vasava’s ballot paper and Congress defector Kamshi Patel’s ballot papers could be deduced since they were both one of a kind. While other MLAs gave first and second preference votes to the same party, Vasava’s vote was presumably the one which put Ahmed Patel as his first preference and Amit Shah as his second. Kamshi’s ballot paper had Balwantsinh Rajput as the first preference and Ahmed Patel as his second. The BJP’s cover-up for the NCP is presumably because it does not want the NCP volte-face to be perceived as a quid pro quo for any future attempt to soft-pedal the controversial Rs 50,000 crore aircraft purchase order for Air India when Praful Patel was Civil Aviation minister.

Uprashtrapati patni

Before Venkaiah Naidu’s name was announced for vice-president, he sought to scotch rumours with his typical witty quip. “I neither want to be Rashtrapati nor Uprashtrapati. I am happy being Usha’s pati.’’ Naidu had to eat his words when nominated as the vice-presidential candidate. During the week of his election and swearing-in, Naidu’s wife Usha appeared briefly in public. But ever since, the vice-president’s spouse is not to be seen. She did not show up even at the Independence Day reception. Naidu explained that his wife has shied away from the limelight throughout his political career and prefers to stay at home.

A man on Saturday stabbed seven people on the street in Russia’s far northern city of Surgut before being shot dead by the police. As per a report in Reuters, the Islamic State has claimed the responsibility for the attack. Russia’s Investigative Committee which probes major crimes in the nation said, armed police was called at the crime scene and the attacker was ‘liquidated’. The Committee said it has established the man’s identity, confirming him to be a local resident born in 1994.

According to the regional police, officers present at the scene fired warning shots before taking down the suspect who was wearing a balaclava. A statement released by the regional government said, two out of the seven injured are in critical condition. The city lies some 2,100 kilometers northeast of Moscow in the oil-rich Khanty-Mansi region.

"Chhattisgarh horror: In 2 more gaushalas, dozens of carcasses, starving cows","At the Mayuri gaushala in Rano, Durg. Express Photo by Dipankar Ghose At the Mayuri gaushala in Rano, Durg. Express Photo by Dipankar Ghose

The mass starvation of cows in a shelter run by a BJP leader in Rajpur village of Chhattisgarh’s Durg district may not be an isolated tragedy. The same horror is visible in two other gaushalas that the BJP leader runs not far away. The Indian Express reported in its Saturday edition the deaths of cows for want of food and water at the Shagun Gaushala, run by the BJP’s Jamul Nagar panchayat vice-president Harish Verma. At least 200 cows had died over the last week, villagers said, and The Indian Express counted 30 fresh carcasses on the gaushala premises.

On Saturday, the same ghastly scenes of rotting carcasses lying next to weak, hungry cows barely clinging to their lives were seen at Mayuri Gaushala in Rano village and Phulchand Gaushala in Godmarra village, both in Durg.

Verma, who police said was involved in the running of all three cow shelters, was arrested on Friday for “breach of trust and negligence”. He has accused state government agencies of starving the Rajpur gaushala of funds.

At Rano, 15 km from Rajpur, the gates of Mayuri Gaushala were locked from the outside at 11.30 am on Saturday. A lone policeman stood there; there were no government officials or doctors. Inside the shed, at least 15 carcasses lay rotting, and upwards of 200 emaciated cows, their ribs protruding, herded together on a thick bed of dung, urine and sludge. No fodder or source of water was visible. Seeing humans at the gate, the animals stumbled forward expectantly.

Five kilometres away in Godmarra village, inside the slightly larger shed at Phulchand Gaushala, The Sunday Express counted at least 20 carcasses. Many of what appeared to be hundreds of starving cows were crying out plaintively. Like at Mayuri Gaushala, no food or fodder was visible.

In an open area some distance from the locked shed, stood two tractors overflowing with carcasses of cows, and other carcasses had been dumped on the ground next to a pile of bricks. Villagers estimated there were at least 50 carcasses in the pile, and alleged that gaushala staff had attempted to take some away over the past two days, but had abandoned their attempts after being spotted.

Senior police officers said cases had been registered under sections of prevention of cruelty to animals and breach of trust in all three cases. “It is clear that Harish Verma ran all three gaushalas. He has been arrested, and is being produced in court. Others too were involved in the operation of the Phulchand and Mayuri gaushalas, and we will be arresting them as well,” Dipanshu Kabra, Inspector General of Police, Durg Range, said.

While negligence and breach of trust seem obvious, there was likely a misappropriation of funds too, in all cases. All three gaushalas received grants of lakhs of rupees from the Chhattisgarh Gau Seva Aayog, an independent commission set up by the state government to look after cows. Officials said the grants are meant to aid those running the shelters in procuring fodder, access to water and medicines. According to statements of the Aayog given to police, Shagun Gaushala has received Rs 93 lakh since its inception in 2011. Mayuri and Phulchand have received Rs 22.64 lakh and Rs 50 lakh from 2015 and 2014 respectively.

Asked why there were no checks on the spending of grants, Aayog president Visheshwar Patel said, “We had carried out inspection checks at these gaushalas in July 2016. Irregularities were found, such as inadequate facilities and excessively large numbers of cows. An explanation was sought, but there was no answer. So we stopped the grants as per procedure and recommended action.”

But why were the cows left in this state? “Grants are not the sole source of money for these gaushalas,” Patel said. “They are meant to fund themselves with aid from us. We have now sent teams with fodder and medicines, but things will take time… We are also looking at shifting the cows out. Lekin dikkat to hai. (But there are problems)”

The office of Brijmohan Agrawal, the Minister for Animal Husbandry, who is currently on a visit to Israel, said that the minister had asked for a report from the secretary concerned, and based on findings of gross irregularities, has suspended department officials from the districts of Durg and Bemetera.

Members of the Yuva Congress threw black paint on Harish Verma and pushed him around as the BJP leader was produced in a Durg court on Saturday afternoon. The crowd around Verma heckled him, calling him a gau hatyaara, as policemen escorting him struggled to keep the protesters away. The Pradesh Congress said in an official release that the events of the past two days had shown “the country the real face of the BJP”.

At the gaushalas, some doctors said they were unable to do their job for lack of administrative support. A day after at least 27 autopsies in Rajpur revealed that the animals had starved to death, a team of five veterinary doctors from Bemetera district arrived in Godmarra to conduct autopsies and treat the sick cows. They said that it was important to put distance between the carcasses and the cows to prevent the spread of infection. But angry villagers who suspected the carcasses would be removed and the crime papered over, had prevented them, the doctors said.

“We have been here for hours but we can’t enter the shelter and remove the bodies without administrative support. There are only four or five policemen here, and no senior officials. We have been told they are all at Chief Minister Raman Singh’s function in Bemetera and will come here after it is over,” said Dr Hemant Kumar, standing outside the gate of Phulchand Gaushala with four colleagues.

"Alastair Cook gave a batting masterclass and I had the best seat in the house, says Dawid Malan","England batsman Dawid Malan believes that Alastair Cook’s batting was a masterclass. (Source: Reuters) England batsman Dawid Malan believes that Alastair Cook’s batting was a masterclass. (Source: Reuters)

England piled up a massive total of 514 for the loss of eight wickets before they declared their first innings in the first day-night Test at Edgbaston on Friday. Alastair Cook looked in great touch after scoring a brilliant unbeaten 243 runs to become England’s highest Test run-scorer.

England batsman Dawid Malan believes that Cook’s batting was a masterclass and he learnt a lesson about how to be successful in Test cricket after taking “the best seat in the house”. Malan also contributed with the bat, adding 65 runs to a mammoth total. In reply to England’s innings, West Indies finished the second day at 44 for the loss of one wicket.

After the second day’s play, Malan said, “I needed that, I didn’t look like scoring a run against South Africa so it was nice to hit a few in the middle of the bat, and feel a bit more composed at the crease.”

Praising Cook’s innings of 243, he said, “Cooky gave a batting masterclass and I had the best seat in the house. Whether it is a good wicket or not, 243 is a fantastic achievement. I was so impressed with how disciplined he stayed, because he never looked like he strayed from his game plan from the first over of the innings until the last.

“For someone new to international cricket it was great to watch how a master goes at his work, and it showed me what I need to do to be successful at this level. I have quite a few habits in the middle – I like to tap bats and gloves with my batting partner – and he was happy to go along with them to make me feel comfortable. He is a fantastic bloke as well as a fantastic player.”

South Africa is planning to grant diplomatic immunity to Zimbabwe’s first lady Grace Mugabe, allowing her to return to Harare and avoid prosecution for the alleged assault of a 20-year-old model, a government source said on Friday. South African police have put border posts on “red alert” to prevent Mugabe fleeing and said she will not receive special treatment, after Gabriella Engels accused Mugabe of whipping her with an electric extension cable.

South African police have put border posts on “red alert” to prevent Mugabe fleeing and said she will not receive special treatment, after Gabriella Engels accused Mugabe of whipping her with an electric extension cable. But a senior government source said there was “no way” Mugabe, 52, would be arrested because South Africa would weigh the need to seek justice against the diplomatic fallout.

“There would obviously be implications for our relations with Zimbabwe. Sadly the other countries in the region are watching us and how we are going to act,” the source said, asking not to be named. “What is likely to happen is that she will be allowed to go back home, and then we announce that we’ve granted diplomatic immunity and wait for somebody to challenge us.”

The source acknowledged the view widely held by legal experts that Mugabe is not entitled to diplomatic immunity because she was in South Africa for medical treatment, and said her immunity might be challenged in court at a later date. Rights group Afriforum, which is advising Engels, said it would be illegal for Pretoria to give Mugabe immunity and branded the plans a “disgrace”.

I have been wrongly denied Dronacharya Award: Satyanarayana Shimoga,"Satyanarayana Shimoga has coached Rio Paralympics gold medallist Mariyappan Thangavelu (pictured). (Source: Reuters) Satyanarayana Shimoga has coached Rio Paralympics gold medallist Mariyappan Thangavelu (pictured). (Source: Reuters)

Para-sports coach Satyanarayana Shimoga on Saturday claimed that he has been wrongly denied the Dronacharya Award by the government as he has not been chargesheeted in the defamation case, pending at a Delhi court.

Satyanarayana, who has coached Rio Paralympics gold medallist Mariyappan Thangavelu, has been dropped from the list of this year’s Dronacharya awardees due to a criminal case pending against him before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at Saket in Delhi.

It has been learnt that several people had raised objections when Satyanarayana’s name was recommended for the Dronacharya Award.

“I have been wrongly denied an opportunity to receive the Dronacharya Award. Some people jealous of my achievements have made false allegations against my nomination for Dronacharya Award,” Satyanarayana told PTI from Bangalore on phone.

“I am shocked to hear these media reports that my name has been struck down on the basis of this defamation case. “This case relates to a private complaint by someone who

wanted to exact revenge for ousting him from Paralympic Committee of India. Moreover, the case has not reached chargesheeting/chargeframing stage and only summons were

served. If I am going to be denied the Dronacharya Award on this basis, I feel it is not correct,” he added.

The case in question is related to a complaint filed by the former PCI chief Rajesh Tomar, who was ousted by the national para-sports body in 2015 on allegations of mismanagement and misappropriation of funds.

For many years, the PCI has been embroiled in factional fights and allegations of misgovernance and misappropriation of funds which has led to its derecognition and disaffiliation by the world body, the International Paralympic Committee, and the Sports Ministry on two occasions in the past.

Asked if he will legal recourse on this issue, Satyanarayana said: “I am not the person to go to a court to get an award. I will respect the decision of the Sports Ministry. But I want to tell the world that I have done nothing wrong and I have been denied the award despite my achievements.”

Satyanarayana, who has earlier served as PCI Secretary, said that he had written to Sports Minister Vijay Goel and Dronacharya award committee chairman Pullela Gopichand to

allow him to present his side of the story but he did not get a reply.

“I secured highest number of points on my achievements for the Dronacharya Award as a Para-athletics coach,” he said in the letter to Goel, sent on August 17.

“I would like to request your goodself to kindly provide me an opportunity for self appraisal with supporting documents on the complaints against my nomination for Dronacharya

Award,” he added.

In the letter sent to Gopichand, Satyanarayana said that the complaint filed by Tomar at the Saket court was of private nature.

The complaint was filed in order to take revenge from the then office bearers of the PCI and his name has been dragged without any rhyme or reason.

He said Tomar only wanted to harass the office bearers of the then PCI who had passed a resolution to suspend/expel him in a meeting in Bangalore. He said he had not supported Tomar and that why he was made a party.

“The court had issued summons only under Sections 500 and 501 of the Indian Penal Code. No notice/charge under Sections 500 and 501 of the IPC has been issued/framed against me or against other persons made as a party to the complaint.

“In such scenario, my name be considered for Dronacharya Award (Life Time Achievement) for the year 2017,” he had said in the letter written to Gopichand on August 17.

Indian Grandmaster Harika Dronavalli played out two draws against compatriot Eesha Karavade and Spain’s Antonio Pazos Porta in the fifth and sixth rounds respectively of the Abu Dhabi International Chess Festival here.

The World No.9 Indian, playing with white pieces for her first game of the day, got off to a flying start against Eesha. But she could not capitalise on the advantage as Eesha blocked all possibilities to make inroads and lead the game towards neutral territory.

“I didn’t see much happening in the first game and offered a draw, which she gladly accepted,” Harika said after her first-round game.

The draw in the fifth round put Harika up against FM Pazos Porta of Spain. She had to be at her defensive best to contain the attack from her Spanish opponent.

However, it was the Spanish who offered to share the spoils after just 20 moves and Harika accepted. “The position was dead equal and my opponent couldn’t break my defensive strategy, so he offered a draw,” the Hyderabadi said after her second game of the day.

After six rounds in the nine-round Swiss tournament, Harika has registered two wins, three draws and just one loss. She will take on CM Suleymanli Aydin of Azerbaijan for her seventh-round clash and will look to bounce back from the three consecutive draws.

Two Chinese cricketers have been drafted to play in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) next year, giving a boost to the fledgling sport in China. The two players of China national cricket team will represent Peshawar Zalmi in the next edition PSL, Pakistan’s official news agency APP reported on Sunday.

China has both men and women cricket teams, which took part in some international tournaments but have so far failed to make a mark. The players have already been selected from the Chinese national team and a formal contract will be signed by the head of Peshawar Zalmi, Javed Afridi during his visit to Beijing next month, the report said.

Also a proposal has been made to the Pakistan Cricket Board to make China a neutral venue for Pakistan cricket team matches instead of UAE and other countries, the report said.

A number of international cricket teams refused to play in Pakistan due to concerns over security. However, Sri Lanka is expected to play a T20 match in Pakistan in September, eight years after its national team was attacked by terrorists in 2009 Lahore.

Passenger service fee may go up to fill up gap of airports security cost,"Currently, Rs 800 crore is due to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) by the airports operators for providing security to the airports. (File Photo) Currently, Rs 800 crore is due to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) by the airports operators for providing security to the airports. (File Photo)

The Passenger Service Fee (PSF), levied on air travellers, might marginally go up as the ministries of home and civil aviation were finding it increasingly difficult to manage the escalating cost of airport security, the government officials said. The differences between the ministries over who would bear the cost of providing security at airports continued to linger with the Civil Aviation Ministry arguing that it was the responsibility of the central government to provide security since it was a sovereign function.

The Home Ministry had set up a committee to find out the actual cost of providing security in the 98 functional airports while the Civil Aviation Ministry would find out how much revenue it could generate from the PSF, car parking facilities and through rentals in all airports in the country,a senior government official, privy to the development, said. If the revenue did not commensurate with the cost, there was a possibility of enhancing the PSF marginally in future as it had become increasingly difficult to manage the escalating cost of airports security, another official said on condition of anonymity. Around Rs 150 is levied as PSF on each air traveller.

Currently, Rs 800 crore is due to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) by the airports operators for providing security to the airports. Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju, their counterpart in the Finance Ministry, Arjun Ram Meghwal, and top officials had held series of meetings on the issue in recent past but without any results. The ministries of home and civil aviation were also engaged in discussions on how to put in place a unified security architecture for the aviation sector and consolidation of security at airports under the CISF cover.

Out of the 98 functional airports in the country, 59 were under the CISF cover. Among them 26 airports, including those in New Delhi and Mumbai, were in the hyper-sensitive category. Of these hyper-sensitive airports, 18 were under the CISF security cover, while six like Srinagar and Imphal, were being guarded by the CRPF, the state police or other paramilitary forces. Under the sensitive category, there are 56 airports out of which only 37 had CISF cover.

"Pro Kabaddi 2017: Telugu Titans fightback, beat U Mumba 37-32","Telugu Titans claimed their second win. Telugu Titans claimed their second win.

Telugu Titans had won just one of their last nine games and a win against U Mumba, who beat UP Yoddha in their previous game, looked difficult. A win for Titans would have spoiled Mumba’s party. Titans needed a special performance from someone to lift their spirits. Rahul Chaudhari did exactly that, taking his team to a 37-32 win in Lucknow.

Raider Rahul did not hold back anything and raided U Mumba areas with some attacking raids. Mumba defenders were struggling to stop the raider. In the 14th minute of the game, Rahul not only completed his Super 10 but also inflicted the second all out on U Mumba. As the raid turned crucial for Titans, it gave them a six-point lead. At half time the scoreline red 19-15.

“I had asked our coach to give youngsters a chance tonight. We had already lost so many matches. So thought let’s give them a chance. Marta kya nhi karta,” Rahul said, who scored 13 points from 20 raids.

What was missing in their previous encounters, could be seen in this game. Titans kept their defence tight and didn’t let Shabeer Bappu or Anup Kumar score easy points. Happy with the team’s performance, captain Rahul said, “Glad about today’s performance. Had it happened in our previous games, we wouldn’t have had lost so many games. Today’s player of the match was Sombir and I’m sure he will continue the same against UP Yoddha.”

While Rahul led Titans’ attack, young 19-year old Sombir supported his captain in the defence. Playing his fourth game, Sombir scored eight tackle points and took down players like Anup, Shabeer and Kashilinga Adake. One can easily make out how Titans dominated the game as they didn’t let the Anup score bonus points.

Sombir made things more difficult for U Mumba as their defence looked flat against Rahul Chaudhari. However, the game was well-balanced until the 33rd before Rahul score four points in three consecutive raids taking Titans score to 31-28.

Dejected with his team’s show, Anup didn’t lose his cool as he feels if Kashilinga’s current form is a major concern for them. “In the last match we saw Shabeer giving his best, now it is important for Kashi to play up to his standards,” Anup concluded.

"Ian Pont, Ajay Sharma shortlisted for Delhi’s coaching jobs","Ian Pont has also worked with the Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar. (Source: Twitter) Ian Pont has also worked with the Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar. (Source: Twitter)

The Cricket Affairs Committee headed by Madan Lal has shortlisted 20 candidates for Delhi’s various coaching job from senior to age-group which includes anti-corruption crusader Ian Pont as well tainted Ajay Sharma, who was banned for life by BCCI on match-fixing charges.

Last year’s coach KP Bhaskar has also been shortlisted for the senior team’s job along with former coaches Vijay Dahiya, Manoj Prabhakar and Sanjeev Sharma. Another notable name is former left-arm spinner Sunil Joshi, who coached Assam last year.

Sharma, a Ranji stalwart, got relief from a Delhi Sessions Court in 2014, which cleared him of all charges but the BCCI is yet to clear his benevolent fund even after three years.

It has been learnt that Sharma wants to be an age-group team coach as his elder son Manan Sharma plays for Delhi senior team. “Ajay Sharma has clarified that his application is for junior coach’s post as his son Manan is playing Ranji Trophy for Delhi and it will be a Conflict of Interest. We need to get clarity from the BCCI whether we can go ahead with Sharma’s application process,” a CAC member, who cannot come on record, told PTI on Friday.

The most inspired shortlist in Englishman Pont, a former Essex fast bowler, who played a significant role in helping the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) of the ICC bust the match-fixing racket during the Bangladesh Premier League, two seasons ago.

Pont was praised by the ICC for showing courage to report corrupt approach. The other shortlisted candidates for coach’s job include

Ashok Malhotra, Amit Bhandari, Bantu Singh, Hitesh Singh and Raju Sharma.

Virat Kohli’s coach Rajkumar Sharma has also applied for the junior coach’s job.

"Kareena-Karisma, Sonam-Arjun: Bollywood’s most stylish siblings","Be it attending red carpet events or simply letting their hair down, these Bollywood siblings do everything in style. From Kareena-Karisma to Malaika-Amrita and Jhanvi-Khushi from the younger generation, spotting these celebs in designer wears is a delight. Even though they commit fashion faux pas, at most times, these celebs manage to leave us spellbound with their superb sense of style. Lets' take a look at few of the most stylish siblings in Bollywood.

Kareena Kapoor Khan and Karisma Kapoor: They are considered as one of the most stylish sister duo in Bollywood. Mostly, these two beauties manage to impress us but they are humans too, fashion faux pas is a part of learning.



At Saif Ali Khan's 47th birthday bash, Kareena Kapoor Khan's nude lips became a talking point. Now, it might have looked good on her in person but going by the photos, it didn’t impress us much. In fact, it just added age to her face and the bronze make-up didn’t help either, it simply looked like she suffered sunburns. However, her choice of outfit is commendable. We love the gorgeous peek-a-boo Self-Portrait top which she paired with simple black leggings.



Meanwhile, sister Karisma Kapoor impressed us in a military green shirt with embellished shoulders, black leggings and a hot pink pout and sister-in-law Soha Ali Khan made for a pretty picture with the baby bump in a blue gown with a side-slit and a metallic hair accessory. (Source: Instagram/therealkarismakapoor)

At their father's 70th birthday party thrown by Kareena, both the sisters were seen wearing their favourite designer and friend, Manish Malhotra’s outfits. While Kareena picked a powder blue suit with gold embroidery on it, Karisma chose a beige outfit with beautiful white embroidery. Both of them paired it with metallic silver sandals. (Source: Instagram/Karisma Kapoor)

Kareena Kapoor Khan was seen at a party with her sister Karisma and husband Saif Ali Khan. This is from last year when she was heavily pregnant with Taimur Ali Khan. The actor looked gorgeous in a custom-made black gown with a plunging neckline by Gauri and Nainika. The gown with the lace bodice and sleeves accentuated her curves to perfection and she styled it well with jewellery from Jet Gems and hair in natural waves. Meanwhile, Karisma Kapoor looked all ready to party in the Robert Rodriguez number at Manish Malhotra's 50th birthday party. We love how she styled the black strapless ruched dress with gold sequin inserts with a pair of matching Louboutins, a black clutch and a sleek ponytail. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Malaika Arora and Amrita Arora: This sister duo is a source of inspiration for fashionistas out there. Three words come to our mind when we think of their wardrobe - chic, sharp and really smart. Undoubtedly, they have a great sense of style.

All decked up, Amrita opted for a coral sari by Seema Khan with a gold blouse, while Malaika looked beautiful in a blue and metallic Sonaakshi Raaj creation. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Jhanvi Kapoor and Khushi Kapoor: They are known as the Kendall sisters of Bollywood and why not! Going by their Instagram posts, these siblings are stylish as one can be and seeing them in designer wear is a delight.



Here, they can be seen with their mom. While Jhanvi Kapoor (R) looks lovely in a colourful sheer yoke detail, embroidered fit and flare dress by Temperley London, her sister Khushi looks equally good in a white and blue dress with crochet work and a ‘Peter Pan’ collar.

Both sisters were styled like Rajasthani royalty with statement jewellery and lehengas from their favourite designers, Manish Malhotra. (Source: Instagram/jhanvikapoor)

Seen here again in Manish Malhotra with their mom Sridevi and dad Boney Kapoor. (Source: Instagram/jhanvikapoor)

Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan: Sara Ali Khan is always on the radar for her impeccable fashion sense, but Ibrahim Ali Khan, not so much. However, he still manages to make heads turn with his super cool sense of dressing and his striking resemblance to his dad.



Here, Sara Ali Khan is seen in a beautiful Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla lehenga, while brother Ibrahim is seen keeping it casual in a basic grey tee, ripped denims and sneakers. (Source: Varinder Chawla/Instagram)

Sara is seen wearing a blush pink satin playsuit from River Island, while Ibrahim tries to keep it cool with a Darth Vader tee. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

The siblings teach us how to ace Indian wear. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Shilpa Shetty and Shamita Shetty: They are known to make fashion faux pas on the red carpet, but Shilpa Shetty and Shamita Shetty still manage to give us inspiring looks from time to time.



Here, the sisters show us how to rock monotone outfits and shimmer in style. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Seen here, is Shilpa in a gold thigh-high slit gown designed by Manish Malhotra, Mehernosh Heeramaneck golden earrings and pointed heels by Oscar de la Renta. Shamita picks up a cherry red one-shoulder gown by the same designer. (Source: Manish Malhotra/Instagram)

Montone outfits, once again!

Parineeti Chopra and Priyanka Chopra: Their sense of style has evolved over the years and at times they give us stellar looks, a few of them so good that it's difficult to take our eyes off them. These siblings are also good at casual dressing.



Take this example, where Parineeti is seen in a body-hugging grey dress and Priyanka in a beautiful yellow pantsuit from 3.1 Phillip Lim. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Sonam Kapoor and Harshvardhan Kapoor: Style runs in their family and every appearance of them is an inspiring one. While Sonam experiments a lot, Harshvardhan likes to stick to sharp, clean cuts.



Here, the siblings are seen rocking suits in their own way. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Shraddha Kapoor and Siddhanth Kapoor: Whether it's girl-next-door looks, grunge or boho chic, Shraddha can carry off anything with ease. Her brother is hardly seen making an effort but when he is in the mood, he cleans up really well. Isn't this photo proof?

We love Shraddha in this lovely cold-shoulder dress and Siddhanth in the classic combo. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Shweta Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan: While Abhishek Bachchan is not known for his sense of style, Shweta Nanda is! Be it Indian wear or western, we think she is really, really good.



Seen here are the siblings rocking Indian wear. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Look at how lovely they look! We totally love Shweta Nanda's belted shirt-dress by Israeli designer, Dodo Bar Or and also, Abhishek's spruced-up look. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Suhana Khan and Aryan Khan: They are always in the news for being superstar Shah Rukh Khan's children. While a lot has been said about their sense of style, we think they don't really care about it as at most times these siblings are seen keeping it cool in basics. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

However, when they clean up, they do it in style. We love Suhana's tangerine Hervé Léger bandage dress and Aryan's super cool hairstyle. (Source: Varinder Chawla, Instagram)

Soha Ali Khan and Saif Ali Khan: There sense of style reflects royalty. We think it's really inspiring. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Need more proof? (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Sonam Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor: She is obviously hailed as the high priestess of fashion in India and no one can match up to her superb sense of style but Arjun Kapoor is not so bad himself.

"This ‘longest’ hanging bridge in Switzerland, overlooking the Alps, will take your breath away!","A couple walks on the “Europabruecke”, supposed to be the world’s longest pedestrian suspension bridge with a length of 494m, located in Randa, Switzerland.

Switzerland is known for many things, from snow-capped mountains to Swiss chocolates, there is no dearth of reasons why one must visit the magical place. And to top that, it has now officially opened the world’s ‘longest’ suspension bridge. The 494m-long pedestrian hanging bridge is perfect for hikers and for wanderers who love to explore nature at its best. But, it is not for the faint-hearted. The adventurous walk down the ‘Europabruecke’ bridge, connecting Grächen and Zermatt, is at a “dizzying height”, according to the Zermatt tourism board website.

The bridge is located along the Europaweg trail offers views of the Matterhorn, Weisshorn and the Bernese Alps mountains. The bridge will also provide an opportunity for travellers to witness the highest mountains in Switzerland the Dom (4,545m).

However, along with breathtaking view, it could literally take away the breath of people with vertigo. “The path runs between 1,600m and 2,200m above sea level and high above the deepest cut valley in Switzerland,” the tourism board added.

The bridge is situated on the Europaweg that connects the villages of Zermatt and Graechen. (Source: Keystone via AP) The bridge is situated on the Europaweg that connects the villages of Zermatt and Graechen. (Source: Keystone via AP)

Though the board pegged it as the ‘longest’ bridge in the world, hanging at a heady 85m above the Grabengufer ravine, it is not the highest one, hanging from scary heights. A 405m bridge in Reutte, Austria hangs 110m higher. Not to forget the deadly glass-bottom bridges in China’s Guizhou province.

A samurai sword-wielding attacker carrying the national flag of China slashed a military police guard outside Taiwan’s presidential office today, authorities said. The Taiwanese man who was arrested at the scene said he was expressing his political views and had stolen the sword from a nearby history museum, police told AFP. The presidential office in the centre of the capital Taipei is the headquarters of Taiwan’s Beijing-sceptic President Tsai Ing-wen. Relations with Chinese authorities have deteriorated since she took office last year as she has refused to agree to Beijing’s stance that Taiwan is part of “one China”.

The island is a self-ruling democracy, but Beijing still sees it as part of its territory to be reunited. The attacker “took a hammer and smashed a display case in a history museum to steal a samurai sword”, a police official working on the incident, who did not want to be named, told AFP.

“A Chinese national flag was found in his backpack. He said he wanted to express his political stance by going to the presidential office,” the official said. The man, identified only by his family name Lu, stabbed the officer as he tried to stop him entering the complex from a side gate, said presidential spokesman Alex Huang. Lu is currently being questioned by police.

The injured guard is in a stable condition after being rushed to hospital for treatment, Huang said. Local media said the guard had been stabbed in the neck and that the presidential office was hosting a family event for its staff at the time. TV footage showed Lu being carried away by four officers and put inside a police car at a side entrance to the presidential office, which has been cordoned off since the attack. The complex and its surroundings have been the target of attacks before.

In November 2014 a driver tried to smash his vehicle into the front door of the nearby presidential residence, saying he was protesting the health policies of Tsai’s predecessor Ma Ying-jeou, who was in power at the time. In January 2014 a man drove his truck through a bullet-proof screen and into the main gate of the presidential office, saying he was protesting over a judicial hearing involving his ex-wife. There were no injuries from either incident, apart from one of the drivers who was wounded.

Princess Diana’s death forced British royals to overhaul image,"The death of Princess Diana marked a turning point for the royal family, forcing a revolution in its communications machine that helped revive the brand. (File photo) The death of Princess Diana marked a turning point for the royal family, forcing a revolution in its communications machine that helped revive the brand. (File photo)

Public anger at the monarchy following the death of Princess Diana marked a turning point for the royal family, forcing a revolution in its communications machine that helped revive the brand. As mourners left thousands of bouquets of flowers at the gates of Buckingham Palace and nearby Kensington Palace, after Diana’s death on August 31, 1997, the royal family were nowhere to be seen.

Prince Charles, divorced from Diana, and his mother Queen Elizabeth II remained at their Scottish residence of Balmoral, saying nothing for days. Despite the British public’s mounting anger at the royal response or lack thereof it was not until the day before Diana’s funeral that the queen finally broke her silence with a live broadcast to the nation.

The monarch’s distance from the public outpouring of grief for the woman dubbed the “people’s princess” by then prime minister Tony Blair caused resentment. Having been immersed in protocol and tradition for centuries, the royals quickly realised they were in urgent need of an image overhaul.

In her tribute to Diana, the queen said: “I for one believe that there are lessons to be drawn from her life and from the extraordinary and moving reaction to her death.” The result was royals “having to become more professional, and having to take real control and take outside advice and better professional people,” public relations expert Mark Borkowski told AFP.

The out-of-touch Buckingham Palace press office, which Borkowski remembers used to close over the weekends while some of the most interesting Diana stories unfolded, underwent a shake-up.

Sluggish employees were replaced with PR-savvy professionals. Patrick Jephson, Diana’s former private secretary, said the current image of the monarchy was the product of a “very sophisticated news management campaign”.

The current media strategy focusses on distributing positive information about the monarchy, while at the same time protecting the royals’ privacy. One of the first tasks post-Diana was to create a more “human” image for the queen, who had been reported as being more concerned about her dogs and horses than her citizens.

Charles, mocked for being haughty and stiff, has also gone through a revamp since his ex-wife’s death. “He has spent an enormous amount of money hiring very sophisticated, professional, political-style spin doctors to manage his image,” Jephson said.

The investment has paid off, with the public’s gradual acceptance of Charles’s relationship with his former mistress Camilla, whom he married in 2005.

"BJP eyes AIADMK, Tamil issues to help Tamil Nadu foray","Both the party and the Central government are soon expected to launch programmes to promote Tamil language (File) Both the party and the Central government are soon expected to launch programmes to promote Tamil language (File)

WHILE THE BJP awaits the merger of the two factions of ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, with speculation that the step is a precursor to the party joining the NDA fold, the saffron party has finalised a plan to go local in order to gain a foothold in the southern states. To begin with, a senior BJP leader said, the party will try and appropriate Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar to endear itself to the Tamil electorate. Besides, both the party and the Central government are soon expected to launch programmes to promote Tamil language.

“There will be installation of Thiruvalluvar statues, programmes to celebrate him, and institutions will be named after him. He will be the first southern hero the BJP will celebrate in a big way,” the party leader said. This effort comes after BJP’s attempts to make electoral inroads with pre-election alliance with a clutch of regional parties and social groups in 2014 came unstuck after the polls. This, party leaders believe, resulted in its dismal performance in the 2016 Assembly elections — therefore the eagerness to get the AIADMK join the NDA.

BJP leaders said the party has “sensed” that it will be difficult to emerge as a strong alternative in Tamil Nadu without the backing of a party identified with the state. “The AIADMK is key for the BJP’s 2019 plans,” a source in the party said. “As the party could lose some seats in northern bastions — especially where it had almost swept the Lok Sabha polls — every seat from the South is significant.”

According to the party leader, there is a vacuum in Tamil Nadu, “and we do not want to leave it to anyone else”. As of now, the leader said, an alliance with AIADMK seems to be the “only way for the party to win seats in Parliament from the state in 2019”. But the perception battle the party is set to fight goes beyond Tamil Nadu — as seen in the recent controversy over linguistic identity in Karnataka, where BJP leaders, faced with a dilemma, found it difficult to take a stand on the charge of “imposition of Hindi”.

At The Indian Express Idea Exchange programme recently, P Muralidhar Rao, BJP general secretary and the party’s Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in-charge, admitted that the biggest challenge for BJP would be finding space for different social, linguistic, religious and communal identities of the people. “…how different identities — social, linguistic and other kinds of identities — how they get the space they deserve. That we have to prove, the government has to perform and show it,” he said.

According to BJP leaders, the party has to “seize” the situation at a time the Congress has failed to address and incorporate different identities. “The party has prepared its strategy in such a way that we will argue that there is no contradiction in the BJP’s approach to (different) issues,” the senior BJP leader said.

England send West Indies into darkness after win in Day-Night Test,"England take 1-0 lead in the three-match Test series against West Indies. (Source: Reuters) England take 1-0 lead in the three-match Test series against West Indies. (Source: Reuters)

England took 19 wickets in a day to send West Indies tumbling to a humbling defeat by an innings and 209 runs in the first Test on Saturday. England won with time to spare on Day 3 of the day-night Test at Edgbaston, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series in the most commanding fashion.

The loss was the sixth heaviest ever for the West Indies in their Test cricket history. West Indies, resuming on 44-1, was all out for 168 in its first innings after lunch and, asked to follow on, all out again for 137 in the third session.

England bowled West Indies out twice in less than 100 overs in total, and the tourists were miles short of England’s first-innings total of 514-8 declared. England’s rampant performance was full of significant moments, not just because it was the first day-night Test to be played in England or involving England.

Making the pink ball game look easy, Alastair Cook scored a fourth double-century and passed 11,500 career runs in England’s innings. Joe Root’s 136 saw him become just the sixth man to make a half-century in 11 straight Tests.

And on Saturday, Stuart Broad overtook Ian Botham to become England’s second-highest Test wicket-taker with 384.

Pre-match predictions were that the young and inexperienced West Indies would struggle in the series, but maybe not to the extent of their showing in the first three days at Edgbaston.

West Indies haven’t won a Test in England since 2000. Despite having a reasonable record at home against the English, they have been outclassed on tour, losing their last four series in England 4-0, 3-0, 2-0 and 2-0. This series looks like it might be completely one-sided too.

The margin of the West Indies’ defeat in the series-opener was the biggest in Test cricket for two years, with the last defeat on this scale also involving the West Indies, when they lost by an innings and 212 runs in Australia in December 2015.

Riders on the storm: Six women get ready to sail the world,"Wonder women: Aishwarya Bodapatti, Pratibha Jamwal, Vartika Joshi, Vijaya Devi, Payal Gupta and Patarapalli Swathi. (Express photo by Arul Horizon) Wonder women: Aishwarya Bodapatti, Pratibha Jamwal, Vartika Joshi, Vijaya Devi, Payal Gupta and Patarapalli Swathi. (Express photo by Arul Horizon)

The girls are busy stocking up on some of their favourite things. “Movies, music, games, books, Kindle, laptops,” says Aishwarya Bodapatti, with a smile. It’s not exactly a long vacation, though. Lieutenant Bodapatti and five other women are preparing to go on an adventure of a lifetime — the stuff of adrenalin addled dreams for many: to travel the world on a sailboat.

This Indian Navy initiative (the first such attempt by any navy in the world) will see the team set off on board the 56-ft-long oceangoing sloop, INSV (Indian Navy sailing vessel) Tarini, docked at Mandovi in Goa since the beginning of 2017, by end-August or the first week of September. The crew will look to complete the whole trip in about seven months with four stops in between at Fremantle (Australia), Christ Church (New Zealand), Falklands (Argentina) and Cape Town (South Africa).

Bodapatti remembers her maiden voyage to Mauritius from Goa earlier this year aboard INS Tarini. As it tossed and turned, water filled the deck and soaked the women on board. And Bodapatti found herself thinking back to the time when she had bravely opted to be part of the crew that was to circumnavigate the globe. “I had thought being on the sea meant just sitting back and looking at the waters. Then, our auto pilot went on a blink and the radar packed up. I felt an unfamiliar sense of dread and realised what the sea truly was,” says the 28-year-old naval officer. It was her first experience of sailing the high seas and it taught her never to take anything for granted. A BTech graduate, Bodapatti says that her schooling at the Air Force station in Hakimpeth in Hyderabad (her father worked with the CISF), had a lot to do with her choice of career.

“I saw lots of planes flying (Hakimpeth air force base was very close by) and joining the air force first came to mind. But then I saw the naval uniform and it just looked so smart,” she says with a grin. Bodapatti’s always sought out adventure, though, whether it’s in her love for bungee jumping or river rafting.

The idea for this ambitious expedition was apparently floated a few years ago by the Indian Navy, which had already notched up records with the iconic sailboat Mhadei, commissioned in February 2009. Mhadei made two solo circumnavigations in 2009 and a non-stop one in 2013, before the Navy decided it was time to push the boundaries further. Women don’t typically go to the sea in the Navy, and solo circumnavigation would be practically unviable. Hence, the concept of Navika Sagar Parikrama — the First Indian All Women Circumnavigation of the Globe — was born. Almost immediately, a look-out was sounded for volunteers from the Navy.

One of the first to come on board, however, was Lt Commander Vartika Joshi, who will now lead the expedition as the skipper. “I volunteered for this for the same reason I joined the Navy — to explore the oceans,” says the 28-year-old BTech graduate from Rishikesh, Uttarakhand.

Growing up near rivers — her mother taught at a college in Rishikesh and father worked in Garhwal — made Vartika keen to explore the waters more. “The oceans were the next logical step,” she says, adding that her family was delighted when she joined the navy and again when she opted for the circumnavigation. On what qualities led to her becoming captain, Joshi says, “Perhaps, my ability to be balanced, not take hasty decisions and take each person’s opinion into consideration when deciding things.”

Are they prepared for the challenge ahead? The answer is a resounding yes. “We’ve undergone intensive training since 2015, not to mention the many sailings from Karwar to Porbandar within India (2015 to ’17), and Rio to Cape Town to Mauritius (2016 to ’17) on international waters,” says Lt Commander Pratibha Jamwal, 28, and a BTech from Himachal Pradesh. “We’ve been especially trained to work with the boat’s equipment and its repairs because that’s one of the biggest challenges out in the waters,” she says.

After her graduation, Jamwal had landed a job with an MNC but she opted for the Navy instead as “being a pahadi I had a special inclination towards defence forces.” Labelling the opportunity as the “rarest of rare”, she feels she lucked out with her career selection. “Here, we are paid to travel the world and have the best experiences.”

Lt Vijaya Devi from Manipur, another member of the expedition, says she was inspired by her father, who was with the Manipur Rifles, to take on the challenge of circumnavigation. Devi has four siblings and she’s the only girl. Her family had initial apprehensions about the journey. “But once they visited me here, they melted,” she says.

Lt Patarapalli Swathi, the only married member of the crew, says she had the full support of her parents and husband, also a naval officer. “He knew this would happen before marriage and was well prepared,” says Swathi, who did her post graduation in computer science from Vizag.

The Ocean Sailing Node, where the women were trained, was established in 2016. However, informally, their training had already begun sometime in 2013, aboard the Mhadei. It started to come together in 2015, when all six women were transferred from their bases and stationed in Goa, where the Ocean Sailing Node took over their training. What followed were basic sail training courses at the Indian Naval Watermanship Training Centre, and, Navigation, Seamanship, Communication and Meteorology courses at various naval training schools in Kochi. After com pletion of these, the team sailed from Vizag to Goa independently in February 2016 and then to Mauritius and back, covering a distance of 4000 nautical miles in July 2016.

“By now, the girls have done 18,000 nautical miles of sailing on their own,” says Captain (retd) Dilip Dhonde, under whose tutelage the Tarini crew first learned the ropes in 2015. “When I trained them, I didn’t make any concession because they were women. I always told them, the boat and the sea are gender-neutral. The challenges they throw will not discriminate between men and women, hence, the response has to be likewise,” says Dhonde, who took premature retirement from the Navy last December.

Challenges don’t always come from the sea. The drudgery of long days is a real issue. “It’s important to keep motivation levels high. During long voyages, we sing, have discussions on different issues and reminisce about our childhood and dreams for the future,” says 26-year-old Lieutenant Payal Gupta, another crew member.

“Six people living with each other continuously has its problems — about hygiene, food choices etc. Small things can irritate you at sea and the fact that none of us are very domesticated doesn’t make it easier!” says Bodapatti. Joshi has a solution: dividing the boat area into six parts and making each member responsible for its cleanliness, ensuring no one feels that they’re making more effort at maintenance than the others.

From what it seems, the six women team have it all figured. As they strike a pose, you hear one of them shout to the others, as they perch themselves on the deck, and make the sign of a time-out. “Not V for Victory, Let’s make a T for Tarini.”

Help my only child survive!,"Please help us pay for her BMT by logging on to Ketto.org. Please help us pay for her BMT by logging on to Ketto.org.

Every evening when Aadya watches children in the neighborhood play, my heart breaks. My daughter too was once an energetic presence rushing about. I know that Aadya longs to join them.

It started after Aadya’s second birthday. She got high fever and rashes all over. The local doctor called it skin allergy and prescribed medicines. The fever persisted, and we sought another medical opinion.

The diagnosis was devastating. B – Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia – a cancer that affects the immune system. Our only hope now lies in the contributions of caring strangers through ketto.org.

B – Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. Big sounding medical terms that we knew nothing about, but by the look on the doctor’s face, clearly it was serious.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia affects, breaks down the body’s ability to fight diseases. The cancer starts in the bone marrow, where new blood cells grow. These cells grow very fast and the bone marrow’s capacity to make normal cells is reduced.

The doctor said Aadya needed treatment immediately, or else the cancer would spread. From March to December 2016, she was under the care of Dr. Shweta Bansal at the Sir H.N.Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research Centre in Mumbai. Ten months is a long time for a grown person. To watch our only child suffer through so many blood tests and chemotherapy treatments was very painful and difficult.

After ten months, the treatment ended and we were full of hope that Aadya would begin to recover. Then just four months later, in April 2017, we got the terrible news that the leukemia had relapsed. Since then, Aadya has been visiting the hospital for chemotherapy and tests, every 15-30 days.

Today Aadya is three years old and it hurts us to see her childhood being taken away. She barely eats, feels tired and weak all the time, and gets bruised easily. Even the slightest exposure to infection can be dangerous so we mostly keep her at home. She has missed many days of school and plays indoors. Any exposure to dust is dangerous so we have to make sure that her clothes, food, and toys are kept dust-free at all times.

Aadya’s hope is a Bone Marrow Transplant, which costs a staggering Rs 25 lakh. We have started a fundraising page with ketto.org, counting on people’s sense of humanity to help us with this life-saving surgery.

So far we have spent Rs 15 lakh on Aadya’s chemotherapy treatments, medications, and hospital visits. I am a housewife and my husband earns Rs 25,000 working as a back office employee. We are completely dependent on his salary and had to raise the money for the treatment by taking loans, borrowing from family members and friends and through insurance. All that we have managed to raise until now has been used up in the treatment.

A Bone Marrow Transplant surgery will replace Aadya’s damaged bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells, enabling her to lead a normal, healthy life. Her father is a matching and willing donor but we need to put together Rs 25 lakh in the next one month. We have no means of raising that kind of money.

For Aadya to survive, that operation has to be done in one month’s time. For over a year now, Aadya has been fighting a tough, long battle. Now there is hope that this operation will finally end her nightmare and lead to that one final miracle when we can take our baby home.

We have started a fundraising page with Ketto.org in Aadya’s name, in the hope that people will come forward and help us raise the funds for this surgery.

Please help us pay for her BMT by logging on to Ketto.org.

Help us to bring Aadya home.

Six Vietnamese killed by US war-era bomb,"Most of the blasts are triggered by people striking the bombs while farming or trying to salvage the metal casings and explosives from the munitions. Most of the blasts are triggered by people striking the bombs while farming or trying to salvage the metal casings and explosives from the munitions.

Six Vietnamese villagers, including three children, were killed Friday when a US war-era bomb exploded in a mountainous area along the country’s south central coast, state media reported. Early reports said authorities believe the ordnance detonated after villagers discovered it in their farmland in Khanh Hoa province.

“The initial reason for the blast, which killed six, was that people were cutting open the 105 mm shell”, reported VGPNews, the government’s online mouthpiece.

Local police refused to comment on the accident, which also left two villagers wounded and tore down a house in Ta Luong village, according to state media. Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, more than 42,000 people have been killed and over 62,100 injured by unexploded ordnance dropped by US aircraft, according government figures.

Most of the blasts are triggered by people striking the bombs while farming or trying to salvage the metal casings and explosives from the munitions. The metal is usually sold for scrap, while the explosives are used by fishermen. According to the government, half of the 15 million tonnes of bombs dropped by American forces are still embedded in farmland and jungle across Vietnam’s central provinces.

Replace bureaucrats in SAI with professionals: PM’s Olympic Task Force,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed the task force last year in the aftermath of India’s disastrous Olympic campaign in Rio de Janeiro. Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed the task force last year in the aftermath of India’s disastrous Olympic campaign in Rio de Janeiro.

The tast force appointed by the Prime Minister to chalk out a roadmap to improve India’s performance at the Olympics has recommended “significant restructuring” of the Sports Authority of India (SAI), urging that it should primarily be responsible to run “academies of excellence”.

The Olympic Task Force has also suggested that qualified professionals should replace bureaucrats at SAI and the agency given complete financial autonomy. “Instead of deputing government officers to SAI, the new SAI would be fully professionalised and only specialists on contractual basis with clearly defined deliverables, shall be appointed on the board and all functions down the line,” states the report.

“Full financial autonomy needs to be given to SAI. They should be allowed to raise the resources to run their various programs,” it states.

The onus to implement the recommendations will be on the Prime Minister’s Office and the Sports Ministry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed the task force last year in the aftermath of India’s disastrous Olympic campaign in Rio de Janeiro. It was mandated to come up with suggestions to improve India’s performance at the 2020, 2024 and 2028 Olympics.

The eight-member committee, which included Olympians Abhinav Bindra, Pullela Gopichand and Viren Rasquinha, submitted its final 144-page report to the government earlier this week. SAI deputy director general Sandip Pradhan is the convener.

Among other things, it has suggested that sportspersons should be considered “active” only till the age of 28. After that, depending on their national ranking, it has been recommended that they be “reskilled” as a coach or referee. The task force has also advocated tax exemptions for various IPL-style leagues for the first five years to make the effort sustainable.

However, one of the biggest changes it has suggested is redefining the role of SAI. Since it was formed after the 1982 Asian Games, SAI has become the nodal organisation vis-a-vis the Olympic programme. It houses most of the Olympians at its hostels, hosts national camps for all sports and conducts coach certification as well as grassroot programmes. A majority of the stadiums, especially in Delhi, come under SAI.

The authority, though, has often been criticised for providing below-par facilities to athletes and being too bureaucratic. At most of its 80-plus centres, there is a severe shortage of qualified coaches and the campers routinely criticise the conditions at the hostels and training venues.

The Olympic Task Force has called for a complete overhaul of the structure. It has suggested that SAI should only be responsible for training and preparation of elite athletes instead of focussing on grassroots, intermediate and elite levels, like it currently does. “From the perspective of long-term athlete development, SAI should now only run the academies of excellence (mainly 17+ players in the train-to-compete and train-to-win stage),” the report states.

To reduce government interference, the committee has urged that the set-up be professionalised by ending the concept of deputing government officers to SAI. As per the current policy, the body is headed by a director general who is a bureaucrat and reports to the sports ministry. All other positions in the organisation, too, are taken up by government employees.

The agency also depends on the sports ministry for funds. At the same time, the task force has called for complete financial autonomy, insisting that 25 per cent of SAI’s budget in running the academies must come from the corporate sector and internal income.

According to the report, a “detailed exercise” on restructuring SAI will be undertaken once the recommendation is accepted.

This isn’t the first time that the need to restructure SAI has been brought up. In 2015, then sports minister Sarbananda Sonowal said it was necessary to “restructure SAI cadre” and in the same year, a Parliamentary Standing Committee came down heavily on SAI for continuing to work in a bureaucratic manner by appointing people without sports background at key positions.

On both occasions, though, there was no follow-up. A task force member said they are hopeful that the Prime Minister’s Office and the sports ministry will accept the report in its entirety. “How much they implement is something we can’t say,” the member said.

A van crashed into dozens of people in the centre of Barcelona on Thursday and Spanish media said at least two people were killed. Police said several people were injured and described the incident on Twitter as a “massive crash”. A police spokesman said he could not confirm any deaths or that the incident was being treated as terrorism. Soon afterwards, Spain’s El Periodico newspaper reported that two armed men were holed up in a bar in Barcelona’s city centre, and reported gunfire in the area, although it did not cite the source of the information.

It was not immediately clear whether the incidents were connected. Following the van crash, emergency services said people should not go to the area around Barcelona’s Placa Catalunya, one of the city’s main squares at the top of the famous Las Ramblas avenue, and requested the closure of nearby train and metro stations.

El Pais newspaper said the driver of the vehicle had fled on foot after mowing down dozens of people. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he was in contact with authorities, and the priority was to attend to the injured. The incident took place at the height of the tourist season in Barcelona, which is one of Europe’s top travel destinations with at least 11 million visitors a year.

While full details of the van incident were not immediately clear, vehicles have been used to ram into crowds in a series of militant attacks across Europe since July 2016, killing well over 100 people in Nice, Berlin, London and Stockholm. Witness Ethan Spibey told Britain’s Sky News: “All of sudden it was real chaos. People just started running screaming, there were loud bangs. People just started running into shops, there was a kind of mini-stampede where we were, down one of the alleyways.”

He said he had taken refuge with dozens of other people in a nearby church. “They’ve locked the doors because I’m not sure whether the person who may have done it has actually been caught, so they’ve locked the doors and told people just to wait in here.” In recent weeks, threatening graffiti against tourists has appeared in Barcelona. In one video released under the slogan “tourism kills neighbourhoods”, several hooded individuals stopped a tourist bus in Barcelona, slashed the tyres and spray-painted the windscreen.

The deadliest recent attack in Spain was in March 2004, when Islamist militants placed bombs on commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people and wounding more than 1,800.

Donald Trump claims media ‘misrepresent’ his Charlottesville comments,"President Donald Trump (Source: AP) President Donald Trump (Source: AP)

President Donald Trump took a swing at his favorite punching bag today, claiming his comments about the deadly violence in Charlottesville were misrepresented by media. “The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!,” the US president wrote on Twitter. One protester was killed in violent clashes between neo-Nazi and so-called “Alt-Right” demonstrators and counter-protesters in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville Saturday. Both Democrat and Republican politicians criticized Trump’s initial response — when he condemned violence “on all sides” — as inadequate.

On Monday he singled out the Klu Klux and neo-Nazis as “repugnant,” but on Tuesday he returned to his original position and said there had been “blame on both sides.” Trump’s weak condemnation of the racist far-right set off a political firestorm across the US political spectrum. World leaders also criticized Trump’s response. The US president also took aim at two fellow Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

“Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists… and people like Ms. Heyer,” Trump said on Twitter. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed in Charlottesville on Saturday when a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd protesting the far-right march.

“Such a disgusting lie,” Trump said. “He just can’t forget his election trouncing. The people of South Carolina will remember!” Trump appeared to be referring to his defeat of Graham in last year’s presidential primary. Graham had said the US president “took a step backward” Tuesday “by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally” and people like Heyer.

Trump also blasted Flake, one of the few Republicans openly critical of the president. “Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He’s toxic!” Trump tweeted.

"Rajnikanth’s decision to join politics entirely his own, says Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan","“It is for Rajinikanth to decide whether to enter politics or not. It is not wrong if he joins politics,” Radhakrishnan said. (Source: Express Photo) “It is for Rajinikanth to decide whether to enter politics or not. It is not wrong if he joins politics,” Radhakrishnan said. (Source: Express Photo)

Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan on Sunday said it would not be wrong if actor Rajnikanth took the political plunge and that the decision was entirely up to him. The superstar has given ample indications of his intention to embrace politics in the past. “It is for Rajinikanth to decide whether to enter politics or not. It is not wrong if he joins politics,” Radhakrishnan said.

The BJP leader declined to comment on a conference organised by a section of fans of the actor in Tiruchirapalli to project him as the alternative to the “vacuum” in Tamil Nadu politics and to request him to embrace politics.

He said BJP chief Amit Shah’s countrywide tour aims to strengthen the party for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls elections.

On the warring factions in the AIADMK, he said: “It is a 40-year-old party … The BJP does not want to see it break up.”

He said Tamil Nadu would reach great heights in development in the years to come if the AIADMK and the DMK were out of power in the state.

On the Sri Lankan government’s decision to release 42 boats of Indian fishermen, seized by the island nation’s navy, he said it became possible due to the efforts of the Centre.

Meanwhile, Rameswaram Fishermen Association President P Sesuraja, part of a seven-member delegation that inspected the boats released by the Lankan government, said only 33 of the 42 crafts were in a usable condition.

He was part of the delegation led by Fisheries Additional Director G S Sameeran that inspected the boats at various places in Sri Lanka from August 17 to see if they can be brought back to the state.

Nine other boats were in a bad condition as they were exposed to the vagaries of weather and cannot be used, he told PTI on his return from Colombo.

He also urged the government to take steps to secure the release of 100 odd boats still in the custody of Sri Lanka before the start of the northeast monsoon in October-November.

70 Years of Independence: The self-congratulatory British Press at the eve of India’s freedom,"Express photo: August 15, 1947. FREEDOM LIKE A WHIFF OF FRESH AIR ENGULFS THE RAISINA HILL. MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN TRY TO ABSORB THE LONG AWAITED MOMENT. Express photo: August 15, 1947. FREEDOM LIKE A WHIFF OF FRESH AIR ENGULFS THE RAISINA HILL. MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN TRY TO ABSORB THE LONG AWAITED MOMENT.

Before the advent of internet age, newspapers played an evermore critical role in writing the first draft of the history and in setting a precedent for how events and occasions would be remembered in future. Leading world newspapers from the New York Times to the Irish Times prioritised the event of Indian independence on their front pages, with typographical emphasis unspared in the employment of big, bold headlines, as this article shows. What is especially interesting is to examine how the British national press chose to interpret the end of its India empire, given that India was the proverbial ‘jewel of the imperial crown’ and easily its biggest source of income in the beginning of 20th century. Only a few years prior to Indian Independence, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill has infamously refused to “preside over the liquidation of the British empire.”

The pro-empire thrust of the British press in the 20th century is widely acknowledged, according to Chandrika Kaul, researcher at the School of History in University of St. Andrews. The press had always been a key player in the imperial project. Scholar Gauri Vishwanathan argues that British proved themselves to be fit to rule to its audience at home and abroad, more by representation than by actual behavior. And in that national press served as a major vehicle for representing these values and their political uses.

Self Congratulatory narratives

“Power is transferred at Midnight” “Indians Praise Britain” (Daily Telegraph)

“Power is handed over to India” “Lord Mountbatten on a friendly parting” “The End of an Era” (The Times)

“India is pledged to peace” “Midnight guns greet two new dominions” “An Accidental Empire ends” “Freedom Day” (Daily Herald)

“Farewell and Hail” (Manchester Guardian)

“India: The end of an epoch” (Spectator)

“Indian Link Arms — Great Freedom” (Daily Mirror)

“India greets Dawn of Independence” (Daily Worker)

The above are the August 15 headlines carried by some of the leading newspapers in Britain in 1947. In spite of the pro-empire trends and their vastly differing takes on domestic politics, the British newspapers were able to find a remarkably consensual, positive reception of India and Pakistan’s newly found nationhoods in the months leading up to August 1947.

One can argue that many of them awarded considerable credit of India’s independence to Britain itself. Both quality papers as well as the tabloids in British press portrayed the transfer of power to India and Pakistan as peaceful and as the ‘fulfillment of Britain’s mission’. Widely quoted and referred to, in these reports, was the Macaulay ideal of Britain’s “proudest moment” — a reference to an event in 1833, when Lord Macaulay, in his Minute on Indian Education, had declared that the eventual self-rule of India would be “the proudest day in British history.”

A ‘progressive mission’ completed

Kaul examines the ways in which India’s decolonisation was viewed as the fulfillment of 19th century ideals that purportedly underlay the very establishment of the empire. A cleansed version of British history in India was generally referenced in these stories. The liberal News Chronicle’s special correspondent Normal Cliff, contended, “Never has a great Imperial Power surrendered its proud domain or freedom been acquired by subject millions by so peaceful and friendly a transition”.

Even The Guardian, which had been ahead of its times in being supportive of Indian nationalism, stated how “freedom by a voluntary transfer of power was unique in the history”. It was further emphasised that Britain had gone to India “not to conquer, but to trade. Events not intention created the British Raj.” In fact, it credited the Raj for enabling “contact with the outer world” which facilitated the “recovery of a vitality and self-confidence” by the Indians. “As soon as this happened, the political changes now being completed could only be a matter of time, for Great Britain had neither the desire nor the ability to rule a people which had recovered the will to rule itself,” The Guardian piece read. The Observer emphasised the “moral and material benefits” that the Raj had brought to India, which included institutions like the Indian Army and the Indian Civil Service (ICS).

Grateful Imperial subject and Wise Colonial Master

The motif of the grateful imperial subject and the wise colonial master was amply present in the British press coverage of Indian independence. Conservative British newspapers such as Mail, Express, Telegraph and the Herald avoided a discussion on Indian nationalism and instead chose to focus on the gratitude expressed by the Indian leaders to the British. For instance, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan was widely quoted as having said, “When we see what the Dutch are doing in Indonesia and the French in Indo-China, we cannot but admire the sagacity and genius of British people … as from midnight tonight we can no longer blame the Britisher”. Left out were all the details about exploitative and racist nature of imperialism and its deeply impoverishing impact on India.

The newspapers described Partition which led to the creation of Pakistan as a “misfortune” and a “tragedy”. Where the communal bloodshed was mentioned, the British steadfastly claimed no responsibility of it. The responsibility of it lay with the Indians. The Guardian maintained, “We have handed over India to the Indians: they have chosen what … seems a second best — a divided India. But it is their choice; if they come together well and good, but their destiny is in their own hands.”

The widespread publicity and coverage of Indian Independence, not only in print but audio-visually in newsreels was a managed staging, rather than an isolated coincidence.

The iconic Punch cartoon shows photographer Mountbatten trying to orchestrate the impossible trio post of the smiling British Lion and the two tigers representing the new dominions.

It was priority for Britain to see the last act of its imperial chapter unfold well, in the interest of international approval and not the least because it also hoped to maintain productive ties with the now independent colonies, where it still had powerful economic and strategic stake. Economists Michael Lipton and John Firn in their book ‘The Erosion of a Relationship,’ mention that by the end of 1950s British private capital in India was “well above the 1948 level”.

Vindicating Britain

Britain had always been divided about how it felt about its Indian Raj — “a paternalistic despotism in the name of the superior Christian civilization or a progressive programme of improvements leading to eventual self-rule,” writes Kaul. The former sentiment had been more strongly grounded in the press, particularly in the right-leaning newspapers. But around the time of Independence, the press attitude took a new character, which reflected the latter. It was able to cast India’s Independence as a British achievement — reflecting Lord Macaulay’s dream in the 1830s — and an organic product of its long-term policy.

This collective honeymoon period of the Press did not not, however, last too long. It dissipated in less than a month alongside the reports about the Partition’s blazing fires. Once more the conservative papers reverted to questioning India’s capacity for self-governance and to the warnings of Churchill about the necessity of the British empire to maintain stability in India. Rebuking this wave, the progressive New Statesman, called it a “deliberate press campaign designed to convince the British public that the end of British rule in India has thrown the entire country into a state of anarchy”. And while the Partition massacres were “a ghastly by-product of painful rebirth” in India, they were “much less serious” than the 1943 Bengal famine which got “barely reported in England when more than one and a half million died”. The contrast points to the multiplicity of ideas floating at the time in the British public opinion above the severing of India.

The reversion of a part of the press to its skepticism about India’s independence soon after the event had a curious, ironic effect. They were able to vindicate and justify the British Empire, while simultaneously celebrating the loss of its crowning glory and deploring the violence of partition.

(The piece draws on history scholar Chandrika Kaul’s observations about British reportage in “Lord Mountbatten and the British Media at Independence”.)

Probe allegation against Kerala Transport minister: VS Achuthanandan,"CPI-M leader VS Achuthanandan. (PTI File Photo) CPI-M leader VS Achuthanandan. (PTI File Photo)

Virtually backing the Congress-led UDF opposition’s demand for a probe into encroachment charges against Transport Minister Thomas Chandy, CPI(M) veteran V S Achuthanandan on Sunday asked the party-led LDF government to order an investigation into the case.

In a letter to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Achuthanandan, Chairman of the State Administrative Reforms Commission, sought the probe, saying it was necessary as the government’s image should not be affected by the charges.

The CPI(M) leader said though the government had explained the matter, the UDF and the media were repeatedly raking up the issue. Achuthanandan said the UDF should not be allowed to take political mileage out of the allegations.

The former chief minister also demanded a probe into the charges against LDF independent MLA M V Anwar that he was running a ‘Water Theme’ park in violation of rules.

Attacking the government on the issue, KPCC President M M Hassan said the LDF has become a government of “encroachers”.

The charges against Chandy, a businessman-turned-politician representing Kuttanad in the assembly, is that he had encroached upon backwaters near his tourist resort at Kuttanad in Alappuzha district.

It was also alleged that he misused his position and constructed a road to his resort using government funds.

Chandy, an NCP nominee in the LDF cabinet, had rejected the charge and stated that he would quit public life if the allegations were proved true. The chief minister had stated that the charges were “politically motivated”.

The UDF opposition members had staged a walkout in the assembly on August 17, demanding the resignation of Chandy and a probe into the charges against him and Anwar.

The charge against Anwar, MLA from Nilamboor, is that the legislator was running a theme park in an environmentally-sensitive area at Kakkadam Poyil in Kozhikode district, violating rules.

He had allegedly constructed a check dam blocking the natural flow of water in a stream, to facilitate its flow to the theme park. Anwar, a former Congress worker, has also denied the charges and termed it as an “effort to tarnish” his “political image”.

VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: This Dhanush-Kajol film suffers due to a hopelessly stilted plot,"VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: Kajol is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings. VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: Kajol is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings.

VIP 2 Lalkar movie cast: Dhanush, Kajol, Amala Paul

VIP 2 Lalkar movie director: Soundarya Rajinikanth

VIP 2 Lalkar movie star rating: 1.5

The only reason to keep watching this film right till the bitter end comes right at the end. This is not a spoiler. It’s just a tip, which comes to you via gritted teeth, because you keep asking yourself in disbelief, just how bad can a Dhanush film get?

Going by VIP 2, let me tell you, it can get pretty terrible.

VIP 2 Lalkar is 99 percent tosh, created for the express purpose of getting Dhanush to sing and dance and ‘do comedy’ and fight, all the things a Hero is meant to do.

Given that the leading man is capable of terrific acting, and has done all kinds of interesting, edgy roles, this one should have been a snip. But he flubs it, essentially because of a hopelessly stilted plot and treatment that is all cliché.

Taking off from where the original VIP left off, we see Raghuvaran (Dhanush) crossing swords with the very toffee-nosed Vasundhara (Kajol), the former being the very proletarian, down-to-earth engineer and the savior of many working class young joes like himself, the latter being the very wealthy, arrogant owner of the biggest architect firm in the region.

‘Vellai’ (work) plus ‘illai’ (no) adds up to Jobless Raghuvaran, whose fight against Vasundhara is on the principles of fairness and justice and truth and saving the environment. That must have sounded good on paper, but is executed so ham-handedly, that you cringe.

And Kajol, who was so good in her big Tamil outing many years ago (Rajeev Menon’s Minsara Kanuvu aka Sapnay, ‘97) is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings. She’s written with no variation, and you watch in despair: Kajol has much more in her; she certainly doesn’t need this. And we are expected to believe that Dhanush, the slender, lightweight Dhanush, can take on burly villains single-handedly, and send them flying, slo-mo.

All you can is to roll your eyes.

And one more thing. Given that there is a female director at the helm, it has surprisingly regressive lines, poking fun at wives and other women. These jokes have gone old, and more so in a film helmed by the next gen.

In the last few minutes, the film changes tack, loosens up, allowing the two leads to break out. Suddenly, we find the two talking to each other, measuring each other up for size, showing us two actors at work.

This could have been the film.

"Police separate some 500 neo-Nazis, opponents at Berlin demo","FILE – In this file photo dated Saturday, Aug. 21, 2004, Neo-Nazi sympathisers demonstrate prior to the beginning of a commemoration march for Adolf Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess in the northeastern Bavarian town of Wunsiedel where Hess is buried. (AP Photo/FILE) FILE – In this file photo dated Saturday, Aug. 21, 2004, Neo-Nazi sympathisers demonstrate prior to the beginning of a commemoration march for Adolf Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess in the northeastern Bavarian town of Wunsiedel where Hess is buried. (AP Photo/FILE)

Some 500 far-right extremists began a march in Berlin on Saturday in honor of the 30th anniversary of the death of top Nazi Rudolf Hess. About 500 counter-demonstrators gathered nearby the parade in the Spandau district, separated by hundreds of heavily armored police.

Berlin police spokesman Carsten Mueller told The Associated Press that authorities have imposed a number of restrictions on Saturday’s march to ensure it passes peacefully. Police have told organizers they can march, but they’re not allowed to glorify Hess, who died at Spandau prison. The neo-Nazis are allowed to bring banners: but only one for every 50 participants.

Such restrictions are common in Germany and rooted in the experience of the pre-war Weimar Republic, when opposing political groups would try to forcibly interrupt their rivals’ rallies, resulting in frequent bloody street violence.

The exact rules differ according to the circumstances, but police in Germany say they generally try to balance protesters’ rights to free speech and free assembly against the rights of counter-demonstrators and residents.

The rules mean that shields, helmets and batons carried by far-right and Neo-Nazi protesters in Charlottesville last weekend wouldn’t be allowed in Germany. Openly anti-Semitic chants would prompt German police to intervene, although efforts would be made to detain specific individuals rather than to stop an entire rally, police say.

Left-wing groups expect about 1,000 people to attend the counter-protests.

Hess, who received a life sentence at the Nuremberg trials for his role in planning World War II, died on Aug. 17, 1987. Allied authorities ruled his death a suicide, but Nazi sympathizers have long claimed that he was killed and organize annual marches in his honor.

The marches used to take place in the Bavarian town of Wunsiedel, where Hess was buried until authorities removed his remains.

Charlottesville violence: Donald Trump lashes out at senator on controversial remarks,"President Donald Trump President Donald Trump

President Donald Trump lashed out at fellow Republican Lindsey Graham on Thursday after the South Carolina senator criticised his response to last weekend’s deadly violence in Charlottesville.

“Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists…and people like Ms. Heyer,” Trump said on Twitter.

Heather Heyer, 32, was killed in Charlottesville on Saturday when a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd protesting the far-right march. “Such a disgusting lie,” Trump continued. “He just can’t forget his election trouncing. The people of South Carolina will remember!” Trump appeared to be referring to his defeat of Graham in last year’s presidential primary.

In an early morning flurry, Trump again sought to cast himself as a victim of unfair press coverage of his remarks. “The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!,” the US president added.

Graham had said the US president “took a step backward” Tuesday “by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally” and people like Heyer.

Clashes broke out between far-right demonstrators and counter-protesters in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville Saturday. Members of organised neo-Nazi and so-called “Alt-Right” groups had called a rally to protest the removal of a Confederate statue there.

Both Democrat and Republican politicians criticised Trump’s initial response — when he condemned violence “on all sides” — as inadequate. After a press conference on Monday in which he singled out the Klu Klux and neo-Nazis as “repugant”, he appeared to move back to his previous position the following day. He once again said there had been “blame on both sides”, setting off a political firestorm.

As the crisis unfolded, senior business executives began dropping out of the White House economic advisory councils to the point that Trump on Wednesday announced he was scrapping them. World leaders have also criticized what they see as a lack of firmness on the issue that could open more space to the far-right in the United States.

At least 13 people were killed and a 100 injured after a van plowed into a crowd in the heart of Barcelona on Thursday. The van had swerved off the sidewalk into an area near the Las Ramblas avenue, a popular tourist district of the city usually crowded with foreigners who frequent the bars and shops on the stretch of this historical market area. The Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility for the attack.

Hours after the attack, the Spanish Police killed five suspected terrorists in Cambrils, which is 100 kilometres to the south of Barcelona. They confirmed that the suspects were planning to target the region in a similar attack. Six civilians and one police officer were wounded by the attackers.

SPECIAL REPORT-How Syria continued to gas its people as the world looked on,"A promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse. (Source: Reuters) A promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse. (Source: Reuters)

In the spring of 2015 a Syrian major general escorted a small team of chemical weapons inspectors to a warehouse outside the Syrian capital Damascus. The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit.

When they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals.

“Look, there is nothing to see,” said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door.

So why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building.

The incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syria’s weapons of mass destruction.

A promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse.

They suspect that President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled.

There have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone.

“The cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and that’s a polite way of describing it,” Angela Kane, who was the United Nation’s high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. “Were they happily collaborating? No.”

“What has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,” she added.

That frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. “I have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,” she said. “We are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.”

The extent of Syria’s reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectors’ relationship with Assad’s administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters:

– Syria’s declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors. Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin.

– Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not “scientifically credible.” Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said.

– At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syria’s military.

– In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

The head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syria’s disclosures.

“There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,” OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters.

But he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job “to ensure the full compliance” of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame.

Syria’s deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the country’s cooperation with international inspectors.

“I assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,” he told Reuters in an interview.

Sharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse.

SARIN ATTACK

On Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assad’s forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack.

In the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assad’s government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to open its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme – after previously denying it had any chemical weapons.

Syria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States.

But there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used.

And in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria’s foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.

Reuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters.

The OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.

The second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad’s forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assad’s forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine.

Although less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorine’s use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United Nations to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids.

A source involved in monitoring Syria’s chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as “a weapon of terror” to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014.

“The base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. That’s why they started using chlorine,” said the source.

A senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.

The introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syria’s chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syria’s declared stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said.

OPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. It concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread.

Uzumcu said the team’s conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban.

Kane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the government’s Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programme’s headquarters.

“Why, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that … I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,” Kane said.

Uzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of a separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW.

“The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,” Uzumcu said.

He said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence.

Uzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syria’s membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation.

Uzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syria’s chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities.

POLITICAL DEADLOCK

The Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council.

In 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacks but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.

The United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks.

Western governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change.

Russian officials did not respond to a request for comment.

SARIN FOUND

Former U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said.

A key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming.

“To my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombs’ payload,” said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was “a real, high-level, command structure behind this.”

Syrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs.

The team is also examining the deaths of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syria’s deputy foreign minister, said in the interview that Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem.

Sellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. “Is there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?” he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well.

The attack means either “that someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,” Sellstrom said.

Manchester United signing of this summer Nemanja Matic said in an interview that the Old Trafford-side is the biggest club he has played for after completing a £40million move from Premier League title holders Chelsea.

After shining in his debut against West Ham on Sunday, when United won their first match of the season 4-0, the Serb said, “Everyone knows what Manchester United is about. It is different. Chelsea is a big club, Benfica are the biggest club in Portugal. But Manchester United is Manchester United.”

Despite lifting the domestic league title twice with the Stamford Bridge club, Matic calls United as a different club, saying that the people there help him every day if he needs something.

“Maybe you have two or three clubs similar to United, but it is one of the biggest clubs in the world for sure. When I came here for the first day, I could feel that the people at the club help you every day if you need something and supporters are very important for this club.”

In an interview to Sky Sports, Matic, who is playing again under Jose Mourinho, said about the Portuguese manager, “He was very important for me. When I decided to come to Manchester, he was a reason to come here. My decision was very quick and very clear. You don’t need to think a lot about if you are going to come.”

H1N1 cases see a dip but dengue still on the rise,"As cases of H1N1 have witnessed a significant decline, from 413 in July to 72 recorded so far, cases of suspected dengue infections remain high in the city. Between August 1 and 15, the public health department confirmed 49 dengue infections and is monitoring 839 other suspected dengue cases across public hospitals in Mumbai.

“Fever cases are on the rise. Advisory for people is to avoid self medication, take ample rest, drink plenty of fluids and consult a doctor, if fever does not subside,” said Dr Minni Khetarpal, deputy executive health officer with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

In the first fortnight of August, 4,339 fever cases were treated in BMC hospitals. With figures from private sectors, the count is expected to be threefold.

The data analysed by BMC, Byculla, Worli, Jogeshwari, Juhu koliwada, Goregaon, Kurla, Chandivali, Bhandup, and Kanjurmarg have shown higher incidence of dengue infections as compared to regions in South Mumbai. Insecticide department has claimed the incidence of dengue is higher in areas where indoor breeding of mosquitoes is ignored. Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the carrier of dengue infection, is known to breed in fresh water, mainly below flower pots, drums, refrigerator plates and on tarpaulin sheets.

Malaria cases have been higher in areas where outdoor water retention is common, such as Parel, Sewri, Dharavi, Kalachowki, Mulund, Matunga labour camp, Borivali, Kandivali and Dahisar.

Additionally, this month the public health department has recorded at least three cases of cholera infection in Dharavi and Trombay. All the patients were minors. In Trombay, an eight-year-old girl was tested positive for cholera, while in Dharavi two girls, aged 9 and 5, were diagnosed.

Officials claimed to have taken all necessary precautions: inspected the drinking water supply and distributed additional chlorine tablets to locals. “Water works department has also been notified to seal leakages and check all supply pipelines,” added Khetarpal.

Australian Nick Kyrgios overcame Spanish veteran David Ferrer on Saturday to set up a clash against Bulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov in the final of the Cincinnati Open.

The 22-year-old Kyrgios, looking for his first title of the year, beat the former world number three 7-6(3) 7-6(4), while Dimitrov also advanced to his first Masters 1000 final with a 7-6(4) 7-6(10) victory over American John Isner.

Kyrgios, who has struggled with hip and shoulder injuries the past two months, showed grit to advance. “He was a nightmare to play, especially because I’m a tall guy and he’s not the tallest guy,” Kyrgios told reporters.

“It’s a tough matchup for me. I thought today I didn’t play my best tennis. In the tie-breaks I served well, but I definitely didn’t bring my best tennis today. I’m just really proud that I managed to scrap out the win.”

Seventh seed Dimitrov needed almost two hours to book his place in Sunday’s final. The world number 11 had his work cut out against big-serving Isner, with neither player dropping serve in a match where break opportunities were few and far between. Isner had two break point chances, Dimitrov only one.

Dimitrov saved a set point in the second set tiebreak, before putting away the dogged American to reach his first Masters 1000 final.

“I think it’s a good step, Dimitrov said. “It’s a good step. I have been on the tour for quite some time now, and I appreciate those moments.

“I’m starting to appreciate them even more.”

"Alastair Cook hits double before West Indies resistance, rain in Day-Night Test","Alastair Cook scored 243 runs for England. (Source: AP) Alastair Cook scored 243 runs for England. (Source: AP)

Rain held up England’s progress after Alastair Cook scored a superb 243 on the second day of the first Test against West Indies at Edgbaston on Friday.

Cook’s 10-hour knock led the hosts to a first-innings total of 514 for eight declared and James Anderson dismissed Kraigg Brathwaite for nought before the tourists battled to 44 for one in reply.

Heavy rain curtailed the final session and West Indies will resume on Saturday 470 runs behind.

Resuming on 348 for three in the first day-night Test in England, Cook and Dawid Malan smoothly extended their fourth-wicket partnership to 162.

Cook reached his fourth Test double century with a thick edge to the third man boundary off Kemar Roach, the former England captain’s 30th four.

Malan, who recorded his first Test 50 in his third match, was out on the stroke of lunch for 65, edging spinner Roston Chase to Jermaine Blackwood at slip.

Ben Stokes (10), Jonny Bairstow (18) and Moeen Ali (nought) fell in quick succession as England chased runs and Cook’s marathon vigil ended when he was trapped lbw by Chase, prompting the declaration.

A callow West Indies batting lineup was always likely to struggle against England’s experienced pace bowling attack and Anderson had Brathwaite caught by wicketkeeper Bairstow for an eight-ball duck.

Powell, dropped by Stokes at gully off Stuart Broad, and Hope battled through to tea without further loss and they extended their partnership in the first match of the three-Test series before heavy rain ended the day’s play.

Govt extends GST return filing date to August 25,"The government on Saturday extended by 5 days till August 25 the last date for filing returns and payment of taxes under the GST regime after the GSTN portal faced technical issues because of a huge rush.

The government on Saturday extended by 5 days till August 25 the last date for filing returns and payment of taxes under the GST regime after the GSTN portal faced technical issues because of a huge rush. The extension came after the GST site went down for a few hours during the day, which was restored by the evening. GSTN Chairman Navin Kumar said the site since has been restored and tax filing restarted. “There was a minor glitch because of the overload, which has been set right,” he added.

Earlier, the cut-off for filing maiden GST returns for July was scheduled to end tomorrow, which explained the heavy traffic at ‘www.gst.gov.in’. But the portal suffered technical glitches as it was unable to take the load.

In a statement, the finance ministry said: “The GST Implementation Committee, consisting of state and central government officers, has taken a decision to extend the last date for payment of GST for July 2017 to August 25, 2017.” It said certain flood-hit states as well as Jammu and Kashmir had sought an extension.

For taxpayers who have to claim credit for past taxes paid by filing form TRANS 1, the last date for returns will be August 28. “In order not to face any last moment technological difficulty in submission of returns, all taxpayers are requested to kindly file their return well before 25th / 28th of August 2017 and not wait for the last date,” the ministry said.

Since today morning, traders across the country faced difficulties in filing returns and uploading GSTR 3B on the GST Network portal — the company mandated to build the IT backbone for the new indirect tax regime. GST Network took to twitter, saying, “The GST portal is experiencing some issues. Kindly try after some time.”

The filing of maiden GST returns for July commenced on August 5. As the problem surfaced, the website of ‘gst.gov.in’ ran a scroll: “We are experiencing slowness and are working to improve the response. Please bear with us.”

Under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, which was implemented from July 1, businesses are expected to file monthly tax returns. While 72 lakh assessees of the old indirect tax regime have migrated to the GST Network portal, nearly 50 lakh have completed the migration process.

"We have confidence having beaten India in Champions Trophy, says Upul Tharanga","Upul Tharanga confirmed that he would be batting at number four. (Source: PTI) Upul Tharanga confirmed that he would be batting at number four. (Source: PTI)

Sri Lanka ODI skipper Upul Tharanga on Saturday said that they will have to quickly forget the 0-3 drubbing in the Test series and draw confidence from their win over India in the Champions Trophy.

“We have got to forget the Test series and the mistakes we made. We are heading for a new format and are looking forward to it. That’s the most important thing,” Tharanga said on the eve of the first ODI of the five-match series.

“India have been very consistent in the last three-four years. In comparison, we lack consistency and that has been a big drawback. Our fielding has been terrible. We have dropped catches.

“But we have the confidence having beaten India in the Champions Trophy (in June). No one thought that we would beat them. If you take the last series, our batting was also good,” the captain insisted.

India have rested their Test bowling line-up of Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav from the ODI squad. But, even with the less experienced bowling attack, India would start as the outright favourites.

“In their ODI side, Bhuvneshwar (Kumar) is their number one bowler. They are without a few bowlers but it doesn’t make their attack any weaker. We cannot under-rate their attack. They have done well in tournaments like IPL. We have to work hard and play well,” Tharanga said.

“I thought we did not play to our strengths during the Test series. We have done well in the ODIs in the last 10 years but the last 18 to 20 months have been a bit different. We have lacked confidence. You cannot give the opposition too much chance and when chances come your way, you have to grab them with both hands,” he added.

Tharanga has led Sri Lanka earlier in the limited-overs’ format, but he is now full-time skipper after Angelo Mathews quit captaincy following the 2-3 defeat against minnows Zimbabwe at home.

“I don’t think I have any pressure. We want to win. We lost to Zimbabwe, but we have a great opportunity to beat India given that we defeated them during the Champions Trophy. We are a confident lot.

“The unfortunate thing is that we lost the series against Zimbabwe. We should try to play with confidence and the fact that we had beaten India in the Champions Trophy gives us a lot of confidence. We can perform well,” said the skipper.

Tharanga confirmed that he would be batting at no.4, but didn’t reveal their first choice playing XI. There is a possibility that Mathews could be bowling again.

“I will be batting at number four. We have not selected the final side but we are thinking on the lines of two seamers and then Angelo is able to bowl a couple of overs. We have also got Thisara Perera. If he can bowl a few overs that enables us to balance the side. That exactly what we were lacking in the last couple of months,” he said.

Winning two ODIs in this series will ensure Sri Lanka an automatic qualification for the 2019 World Cup in England, ahead of West Indies.

“This will be more important as we are ranked eighth,” he said.

"After Barcelona attack, Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull calls for designs to prevent vehicle attacks","Turnbull said the government was concerned about a young Australian who remains unaccounted for following the Barcelona attack. (Source: Reuters) Turnbull said the government was concerned about a young Australian who remains unaccounted for following the Barcelona attack. (Source: Reuters)

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called on Sunday for developers to incorporate safety features into their projects to prevent militant attacks with vehicles and other weapons as he announced new plans to protect the public. Turnbull unveiled Australia’s first national strategy to protect crowded places, which he said was initiated after an Islamist militant drove a truck into crowds in the French city of Nice in last year, killing 84 people.

It comes days after a similar attack in the Spanish city of Barcelona killed 13 and injuring more than 100, and follows a string of similar vehicle attacks around the world. Turnbull told reporters the plan was designed for councils, businesses and venue operators to stop attacks with vehicles as well as with guns, knives, bombs or chemical devices. Steps include the installation of bollards along main streets, and at shopping centres and outside sporting grounds.

Turnbull said while sites would be better protected, developers had to incorporate safety features into new projects on the drawing board. “The best mitigation are done at the design,” he said. “The most important thing is that, as you get new developments, new plans, that security measures are put in place at that time.”

“The threat is constantly evolving, and so what we have to do is make sure that we too are constantly improving and updating the measures we have to keep Australians safe.” Australia, a staunch U.S. ally that has sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, has been on alert for attacks by home-grown militants returning from fighting in the Middle East, or their supporters.

There have been several “lone wolf” attacks and officials say 13 significant plots have been foiled in the past few years. In January, a man drove into pedestrians in the city of Melbourne, killing four and injuring more than 20. Police said that incident was not terrorism-related but the city has put up about 140 concrete bollards around its centre.

Turnbull said the government was concerned about a young Australian who remains unaccounted for following the Barcelona attack. The seven-year-old boy, Julian Cadman, who British media says has British and Australian nationality, was separated from his mother who was taken to hospital in serious condition “We pray that little boy will be found and be restored alive to his parents,” he said.

"India tour is going to be tough for Australia, says Michael Clarke","Virat Kohli (R) will lead India in the ODI series against Australia. (Source: Reuters) Virat Kohli (R) will lead India in the ODI series against Australia. (Source: Reuters)

Australia will get better wickets in the one-day international series than the Test series against India but it will still be tough for them in India as the home team is always a tough opponent in their own backyard, former Australia skipper Michael Clarke said on Friday.

“One-day cricket is different from Test cricket, so I imagine that the wickets will be good. You will see some entertaining one-day cricket, hope the Aussies can perform well and win but it is going to be tough, India are always tough in their own backyard,” he said.

Australia lost the Test series against India 2-1 when they toured in February and March. Virat Kohli led his team to their seventh series win and is recently made it eighth when India beat Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. Clarke praised Kohli for his captaincy.

“I haven’t played for two years, so I haven’t played against this current India team. They are doing extremely well, winning at home, winning away,” Clarke said.

“Look they are led very well by Virat Kohli and they are playing some great cricket, if they are good enough to continue winning, then they will continue to be the number one team in the world,” he added.

R Ashwin, who has been one of the reasons of India success in recent years, also got some praise and Clarke said that no matter where he plays, Ashwin will shine be it Tests or ODIs.

Spanish authorities on Saturday said they are maintaining the country’s current terrorist threat alert at level 4, as reported by the Associated Press. Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the government would reinforce security in crowded areas and tourist hotspots, after a van mowed down people in Barcelona on Thursday, killing at least 13 people including many foreigners from different countries. Another person died after a separate attack in the resort town of Cambrils, where police shot five suspects dead. “We are going to redirect our efforts and will adapt these to every place or area that needs special protection,” Zoido told a news conference.

Zoido also said Spanish authorities considered the cell behind the attacks had been fully dismantled.

Spanish police expanded a manhunt today for a Moroccan national believed to be one of the perpetrators of twin terror attacks in Barcelona and another seaside resort that killed 14 and wounded around 100. With the country in shock after the carnage which saw two men deliberately ploughing vehicles into crowds of pedestrians, Madrid mulled raising the terror alert to the maximum in the world’s third tourism destination.

With investigators working round the clock to identify the network behind the bloodshed, police said they were hunting for 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub without confirming reports he was the driver who ploughed a van into pedestrians in Barcelona on Thursday.

A midnight ride through the rain-soaked Mumbai,"Starting from the Asiatic Society, a group of 50 heads to Marine Drive, NSCI in Worli and then return. Express Starting from the Asiatic Society, a group of 50 heads to Marine Drive, NSCI in Worli and then return. Express

AS JEITAL Dedhiaa rode his bicycle late in the night on Marine Drive, he felt that the city — one of the most romanticised on celluloid — was not lost.

The 42-year-old businessman is part of a ‘Monsoon Midnight Cycle Tour’, organised by Mumbai Riders. “When cycling on empty roads in Mumbai, it looks just like how we see it in the films,” said Dedhiaa.

The tour that begins at 11.30 pm and takes people on a cycle ride across South Mumbai. Starting from the Asiatic Society, a group of 50 heads to Marine Drive, NSCI in Worli and return. With brief stops at Lion’s Gate, Marine Drive and Haji Ali, the 21-km ride takes at least three hours and ends by 3 am. Monsoon Midnight Cycle tours was started by Rishi Shah and his friends while they were in college. “Mumbaikars are hard pressed for time and are looking for unique tailor-made experiences to spend the weekend,” said Rishi Shah, who has organised 30 night cycling tours so far.

“While travelling in Europe, we noticed that the cycling culture was not popular in Mumbai. So, we thought of starting cycling rides to discover the city at night, when it is less crowded. The city is very different at this time — no sun, no horns,” he added.

“This year, we introduced ‘monsoon tours’, as people hardly step out during this time of the year. During the monsoons, Haji Ali and Marine Drive are quite windy, making cycling a pleasurable experience,” he said.

Dedhiaa, who has been part of several tours with Mumbai Riders, said, “I have taken several tours through the year, but the monsoon cycling tours are much more fun. The weather is pleasant at night. Generally, cycling is something we do on vacations in hill stations and not in a city like Mumbai. But, with this tour, one can explore different routes in Mumbai at night,”

The nocturnal ride has seen participants between the ages of 9 and 65. As part of the tour, the organisers provide geared and non-geared bicycles, helmets, light refreshments. The group is accompanied by safety vehicles in the front, while six volunteers tail them.

West Bengal: Statewide tiger census to begin in November,"Counting of tigers is carried out every four years. Counting of tigers is carried out every four years.

The West Bengal wildlife department will begin a statewide census for tigers and other animals in November. The department recently concluded its elephant census and in its report said that there are 490 in North Bengal and 200 in South Bengal. Counting of both elephants and tigers is carried out every four years, while for other animals it is done once in two years in the state.

State wildlife officials are, meanwhile, in talks with their Assam counterparts to try and procure more tigers for West Bengal’s Buxa Tiger Reserve as part of its ‘Buxa Tiger augmentation programme’, the “one of its kind” in East India.

“According to the official count, carried out by protocols set up by the Centre, there is only one tiger in the Buxa reserve. We, however, believe that there may be upto six tigers in the reserve. We are talking to Assam right now and are looking at procuring anywhere from three to ten tigers from there. This will be done in a phase-wise manner. We will first release these tigers into the reserve, see how they behave before releasing others,’’ said Chief Wildlife Warden of West Bengal Ravi Kant Sinha.

Sinha further said that deer population and that of other smaller animals will also be augmented to ensure that the tigers have prey and a conducive environment to exist. The first tiger is likely to be procured by next year.

The Detailed Project Report for the programme has already been approved by both the Centre and the State Board of Wildlife earlier this year. The programme has been developed by the wildlife department with the help of the Global Tiger Forum and the National Tiger Conservation Authority.

“This is a one of its kind programme which has not been tried often. We will be the third tiger reserve to attempt this. Tiger population has been decreasing in Buxa over the past few years for a number of reasons. In-breeding among the tigers here is one reason. Other reasons include human incursions, shortage of food, and migration of tigers to other areas. So we are looking at bringing tigers from other reserves not only to increase the actual population but also to improve the gene pool of the tigers here,” Sinha added.

The Buxa Tiger Reserve is situated in the Alipurduar sub-division of Jalpaiguri district in North Bengal and covers an approximate area of 760 square kilometers under which 314 square kilometers is the actual wildlife sanctuary, while the rest is a reserve forest. While the forest department took over this area in 1866, it was only in 1983 that Buxa was notified as a wildlife sanctuary under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act.

There are 38 forest villages in Buxa and 49 fringe villages and the main source of employment for the locals comes from the 40 tea gardens around Buxa. Sinha said that this programme been tried before only in two other sanctuaries in the country — in Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan and Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh. In Sariska, the project was unsuccessful, and petered out soon after it began.

Meanwhile, Sinha said that the recent floods in North Bengal have not led to any animal deaths, but submerged many areas of some sanctuaries located in the region. “We have not heard of any animal deaths so far. The animals seem to have migrated to higher areas to avoid the floods. Communication has, however, been disrupted with many roads and bridges in the area having been submerged,’’ he said.

"Punish athletes who recommend multiple names for Dronacharya awards, says Akhil Kumar","Akhil Kumar spoke against recommending multiple coaches for Dronacharya awards. Akhil Kumar spoke against recommending multiple coaches for Dronacharya awards.

Former Commonwealth Games gold medallist Akhil Kumar called for cleansing of the system and action against those athletes who recommend multiple coaches for Dronacharya awards, saying that ‘guru ek hota hai.’

In an interview to PTI, the Olympian boxer said, “There are two ways to cleanse the system. You can try politely and if it doesn’t work, then use the rod. If there’s some sanction, they would realise. If you charge athletes under section 420 of IPC (for cheating), they will learn a lesson. I find it surprising that one athlete recommends multiple coaches for Dronacharya award. Guru ek hota hai (You only have one teacher),” he said.

An Arjuna awardee himself, Akhil said, “Take my example. I wouldn’t even know how many have applied for Dronacharya using my name. May be I haven’t even trained under them. If I discuss boxing with someone, he doesn’t become my coach. Look at our boxing (women’s). We have three Arjuna awardees and count the Dronacharyas!”

Akhil suggested that the Sports Ministry should revamp the entire selection process by making it online as solution. “Let’s have every information online. Name the contenders online, cite all their national and international achievements. Mention the points associated with each event and how much points each candidate has got. No one would then question the process. You don’t need committees for that.”

“Don’t just make it a draw of lots so that no one knows who’s getting the award and who’s not getting it. Make it transparent so that the sanctity of such prestigious award is maintained,” he signed off.

State of the Union,"Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran. Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran.

The flaws in India’s internal security management and how it impacts our image in international fora

Title: Keeping India Safe: The Dilemma of Internal Security

Author: Vappala Balachandran

Publisher: Harper Collins

Pages: 328 pages

Price: Rs 599

Internal security provides the foundation for external security and our prestige in international fora. If there are a hundred points of insurgency, disaffection or rebellion, those weaken the social structure and hamper economic growth, and news about these unrests affects other countries’ judgement about our handling of sensitive matters. Unfortunately, our policy makers have not paid adequate attention to this vital sector and their threat responses have been influenced more by political considerations than strategic vision. Much was expected of the NDA government, but unfortunately, it has also disappointed — so far, at least.

Balachandran’s book on internal security is a valuable addition to the literature on the subject. He has drawn our attention to fundamental flaws in the Constitution which are adversely affecting our handling of internal security challenges. The founding fathers, as he says, copied the Act of 1935 while dividing Centre-state subjects without considering whether it would safeguard national integrity in times of turbulence. They should have given concurrent responsibility to the Centre to deal with national security threats, and not doing so was “certainly a lapse”. This view is supported by leading Constitutional experts like Fali Nariman. Not that the government is unaware of it, but it fears opposition from states. The reality has to be faced, and the sooner we do it the better.

Balachandran is on target when he says that after 26/11, the nation was united against the scourge of terrorism, and that it was an ideal opportunity to amend the Constitution and create a federal police which would investigate terror and other cases which had all-India ramifications. “What was however produced was a partly empowered police (the NIA)”. It was a “leadership failure” of the UPA government.

The author also writes of institutions which are either dysfunctional or have no statutory basis. The National Security Council, which should have played a key role, is one of these, thanks to its unclear charter. The National Security Advisory Board is a collection of the best brains in the field of security, but the government has not made use of this vast reservoir of talent. What is worse, the organisation became defunct under the NDA regime, though lately, it has been revived in an emaciated form. The Crisis Management Group could never rise to the occasion, whether in the assassination of Mrs Indira Gandhi or the hijacking of IC-814 or the 26/11 attack. The Intelligence Bureau should have an oversight mechanism and be made accountable. The CBI also requires a legal mandate and greater autonomy in personnel and finance. The Ministry of Home Affairs has become unwieldy and needs to be bifurcated, with a separate division for internal security alone. All these are valuable points and need to be acted upon at the highest level.

The most interesting chapter deals with 26/11. It clearly brings out that the Centre had not passed on any specific intelligence to the State, that the police had reacted promptly with their available resources, and that there was no serious lapse. But the state government could have tightened coastal surveillance and made provisions for equipment and arms easier for the police. The political leadership and bureaucracy were to blame for that. Were they held accountable? Why the Centre didn’t institute an inquiry into the lapses of 26/11 remains a mystery to this day. According to knowledgeable people, the inquiry was not set up because several senior officers in Delhi would have been found guilty.

The NDA government, according to the author, has shown “no interest in revising the stagnant thinking on national security”. The indictment is a bit harsh. The government has taken some initiatives to improve the police and tackle Maoists, but these efforts have not been as comprehensive as was required. The author has also faulted the NDA government for “immaturely” dealing with the Naga problem. The brain behind the framework agreement with the NSCN (IM) was of one of the finest officers of the country. If the framework could not be given a final shape, it is essentially because of the duplicity of the Naga leaders.

The book is full of facts and figures on foreign security agencies. Researchers would find these useful. But William Henry Sleeman has been given more space than he deserved. The detailed accounts of thuggee are, nevertheless, interesting.

Exercise mimicking protein may aid heart failure patients,"CT1 was found to help repair damage as well as improve blood flow in heart failure patients. (Source File Photo) CT1 was found to help repair damage as well as improve blood flow in heart failure patients. (Source File Photo)

Scientists have discovered a protein that mimics exercise and tricks the heart into growing in a healthy way and pumping more blood, a finding that can aid in developing treatments for heart failure patients. The study showed that a protein called cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) leads heart to pump more blood even if an individual is sitting still, making it beneficial, particularly for people with heart problems who find it hard to exercise.

CT1 was found to help repair damage as well as improve blood flow in heart failure patients. Heart failure, which occurs when the heart can’t pump enough blood through the body, is a leading cause of death and disability in high-income countries and a growing problem around the world. “When part of the heart dies, the remaining muscles try to adapt by getting bigger but this happens in a dysfunctional way and it doesn’t actually help the heart pump more blood,” said Lynn Megeney, Professor at the University of Ottawa in Canada.

“We found that CT1 causes heart muscles to grow in a more healthy way and it also stimulates blood vessel growth in the heart. This actually increases the heart’s ability to pump blood, just like what you would see with exercise and pregnancy,” Megeney added For the study, published in the journal Cell Research, the team conducted a variety of experiments in mice, rats and cells growing in the lab. Heart muscle cells treated with CT-1 were found to become longer and demonstrated healthier fibres.

Further, CT-1 also improved heart function in two animal models of heart failure one caused by a heart attack (affecting the left side of the heart) and one caused by high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension, affecting the right side of the heart). “This experimental therapy is very exciting particularly because it shows promise in treating both left and right heart failure,” said Duncan Stewart, a cardiologist at the Ottawa Hospital.

Dalits vs Dalits: Youth killed for ‘helping’ couple elope,"Parents of Kanu Parmar, who has eloped. (Express photo) Parents of Kanu Parmar, who has eloped. (Express photo)

Days after Kiran Parmar, a 21-year-old orphan from Dalvana in Gujarat’s Banaskantha district was killed — allegedly beaten to death for “facilitating” eloping of a couple from neighbouring Varvadiya — decades-old affinity between people of the two villages are at a breaking point.

Kiran, who worked as a waiter in a Surat hotel and had come home to take part in a fair, was a Dalit — as are the couple who have eloped, and many of those arrested for his murder on August 15.

Banaskantha police say this is one of the trickiest case registered under the Atrocities Act in the district in recent times.

“We made immediate arrests and are now looking for the 17-year old girl (name withheld) and Kanu Parmar, who have eloped,” Banaskantha’s Superintendent of Police (SP) Neeraj Badgujar said.

Deputy SP of Palanpur (SC/ST cell) Hetal Patel, who is leading the probe, said the elopement caused a rift in Dalit communities of the villages — many of the residents are related by marriage — and the murder “has made matters worse”.

“Kiran died when he was beaten — brutally — for the second time by men from his own community from Varvadia village,” Patel added.

Those arrested are Ramesh Parmar, Talshi Parmar, Babu Parmar, Ishwar Parmar, Ashok Parmar, Ramesh Parmar, Vira Parmar and Ramesh Dharma Parmar — all from Varvadiya village, where the eloped couple come from — besides Nayan Rabari and his accomplices Vijay Padhiyar from Vadodara and Vishnu Rabari, Mukesh Rabari, Umang Rabari and Vishwas Rabari, all residents of Ahmedabad

“Kiran, 21, and Kanu, 19 (who eloped with the girl), grew up together and were friends. Kiran had come down from Surat for satam mela (a popular fair). He went to the fair with Kanu and the girl, and someone saw them together there,” said Jetha Parmar, a retired police inspector and Kiran’s uncle.

That report that went out, it appears, as Kiran left for Surat after the fair “but the girl and Kanu did not return home”, Jetha Parmar said.

Kiran was heading for Surat in a bus, when Parmars from the girl’s village learnt that he was the last person who was with the couple, and imagined he “facilitated” their elopement. They gave the bus a chase, but unable to stop it, the girl’s father rung up his employer, Amumiyan Lohani, a Vadodara-based businessman, the police said. “Lohani called some friends for help, and his Facebook friend Nayan Rabari responded,” DySP Hetal Patel said.

According to police, Lohani told Rabari about Kiran and sent his picture on WhatsApp, asking him to stop the bus and intercept the young man.

Rabari, who was under the impression that the girl was from his own community, intercepted, beat Kiran brutally to “teach him a lesson” and subsequently handed him over to the Parmars of Varvadia, who got him to Vadodara in a car, SP Badgujar said. Kiran Parmar died on the way — the postmortem records cerebral haemorrhage as the cause of death.

Kanu and the girl both belong to Varvadi village — neighbours and distantly related, Jetha said. “Varvadi and our village, Dalvana, have a history of friendship — we, Parmars, from each village have married our daughters to boys from the other. But this incident will change everything,” he said.

Kiran’s younger sister Asha Parmar told The Sunday Express, “My brother is dead, and we will not get him back. All I hope now is Kanubhai and the girl are not killed once they are found.”

At Dalvana, 5 km from Varvadia, the girl’s mother, Geeta, said, “I do not want to see my daughter again. She has humiliated us… she is dead for me. She grew up with Kanu, my cousin’s son. How could they run away, and in the process an innocent Kiran was killed.”

Kanu’s parents, Vasa and Ratna Parmar, have left home after their son eloped and are staying in a cowshed on the outskirts of the village at present. “We cannot face our community after what our son has done. Our elder son Ramesh is in jail, as he also joined the men in finding Kiran,” Vasa Parmar said.

"India vs Sri Lanka, 1st ODI Preview: India look to continue dominance against Sri Lanka","India take on Sri Lanka in the first ODI in Dambulla on Sunday. (Source: PTI) India take on Sri Lanka in the first ODI in Dambulla on Sunday. (Source: PTI)

Virat Kohli captained India swept aside Sri Lanka with much ease in the Test matches. It started with a 304 run win and was followed up with two victories by innings as India didn’t even need to bat out twice in the second and third Test of the three match series. Even as the format shifts from Test matches to 50 overs, the momentum and odds are firmly in India’s favour.

In the most recent series played, Sri Lanka were beaten 2-3 by 11th ranked Zimbabwe for an embarrassing outcome for once a World Cup winners. This came after the islanders disappointingly crashed out in the group stages of ICC Champions Trophy. India, on the other hand, come into the series after reaching the final of the Champions Trophy and then beating West Indies 3-1 in the Caribbean.

Going into the five-match series, starting on Sunday in Dambulla, Sri Lanka have plenty to play for. Upul Tharanga captained Sri Lanka have face to regain after being beaten by Zimbabwe and then smashed by India in the Test series. Additionally, they need two wins at least to qualify automatically for the 2019 World Cup.

For India, it is an opportunity to test their squad after some players have been rested to allow youngsters to come in. The end goal? Find the right combination for the 2019 World Cup in England. Four key bowlers in R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Umesh Yadav and Mohammed Shami have been rested for the ODI series. In their place, left-arm spinner Axar Patel, chinaman spinner Kuldeep Yadav and leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal will be at Kohli’s disposal. Mumbai paceman Shardul Thakur made a comeback into the squad. Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar seem to be automatic choices in the playing XI.

Over on the batting front, Manish Pandey is once again likely to play in his unfamiliar position of No.5 but with no other option, he will be pushed to make the most of it. It will give him the chance to justify selection over Yuvraj Singh who has not been included in the squad. KL Rahul is likely to stay at No 3.

It will be an important series for MS Dhoni. The 36-year-old will have to justify his selection from now till the end of the 2017 World Cup with more calls for fresh legs into the squad. His hitting with the willow has reduced but where he has dropped in the batting department, he has picked up in keeping with some lightning reactions behind the stumps.

SQUADS:

Sri Lanka: Upul Tharanga (captain), Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella (wicketkeeper), Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Chamara Kapugedera, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Akila Dananjaya, Lakshan Sandakan, Thisara Perera, Wanindu Hasaranga, Lasith Malinga, Dushmantha Chameera, Vishwa Fernando.

India: Virat Kohli (captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma (vice captain), Lokesh Rahul, Manish Pandey, Ajinkya Rahane, Kedar Jadhav, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (wicket-keeper), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Shardul Thakur.

A van drove into a crowd in a busy tourist district in Spain’s Barcelona city on Thursday taking the lives of 13 people and wounding over 100. The attack took place a little after 5 pm at Las Ramblas, a street popular with tourists and locals for its shops and bars, in the central part of the city. Police have labeled the attack as one carried out with intentions to spread terrorism and are on the lookout for the driver of the vehicle. The Islamic State terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Meanwhile, another incident in a similar fashion occurred in Cambrils, barely eight hours after the first one, in which an Audi A3 car charged into wayfarers. As many as seven people were hurt, one of whom is critical. The city is located 120 kilometers toward the south of Barcelona. Both cities are located in the Spanish region of Catalonia. Spanish police gunned down five people on Thursday suspected of carrying out the charge in Cambrils. The BBC reported Friday morning that one of them allegedly alighted from the car in an attempt to stab passersby.

The police had earlier hypothesized that the two events could be linked to one another and have confirmed the same now, according to latest reports. They have also established that the attackers had on belts with explosives attached.

Leaders across the globe have condemned the attack. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed solidarity with the people of Spain and called the incident a “tragic attack”. US President Donald Trump condemned the attack and offered help to the Spanish government. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said, “My thoughts are with the victims of today’s terrible attack in Barcelona and the emergency services responding to this ongoing incident,” adding, “The UK stands with Spain against terror.” Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj confirmed that no Indians have been harmed in either of the strikes. The MEA is in constant communication with the Indian Embassy in Spain to keep tabs on the situation, she said.

"Utkal Express derails in Uttar Pradesh: 20 die, over 80 injured as 14 coaches go off track","Officials indicated that the death toll may rise as some of the injured, who were rushed to hospitals in Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur and Meerut, were said to be in a serious condition.(Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Officials indicated that the death toll may rise as some of the injured, who were rushed to hospitals in Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur and Meerut, were said to be in a serious condition.(Express photo by Praveen Khanna)

In one of the worst train accidents this year, at least 20 passengers were killed and over 80 others injured after 14 coaches of the Puri-Haridwar Kalinga Utkal Express derailed at Khatauli, 25 km from Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, on Saturday evening, officials said. The accident took place at 5.46 pm, as the train was crossing the Khatauli station yard at a speed of 105 kmph, they said.

According to preliminary information received by the Railways, 14 coaches between the first five and the last four went off the tracks suddenly, including 10 non-AC Sleeper, one AC-III tier, one AC-II tier and a pantry car — only two wheels of the 14th coach were dislodged. “Five Sleeper coaches were the worst affected,” said a Railways spokesman.

Officials indicated that the death toll may rise as some of the injured, who were rushed to hospitals in Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur and Meerut, were said to be in a serious condition.

UP Principal Secretary (Home) Arvind Kumar told The Sunday Express, “According to information received so far, 20 passengers have died and 81 injured in the accident. Twelve coaches of the train derailed, with some crashing into a residential area nearby, damaging a few houses. Passengers in eight other coaches escaped unhurt.”

UP DGP Sulkhan Singh said that a team of the state’s Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS), led by DySP Anoop Singh, has been sent to the spot “to help in the investigation”. Sources said that work related to the doubling of tracks was being executed adjacent to the line. “The driver is slightly injured and the Railways is trying to ascertain if he had applied the emergency brakes,” said sources.

According to government officials, four teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) — three from Ghaziabad and one from Delhi — have reached the site.

The Railways, however, could confirm only 11 deaths, with officials saying that they were in the process of verifying the toll. Officials said the schedules of 11 trains on the route were affected by the accident.

Reacting to the accident, Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on Twitter: “Extremely pained by the derailment of the Utkal Express in Muzaffarnagar. My thoughts are with the families of the deceased. I wish those injured a speedy recovery. The situation is being monitored very closely by the Railways Ministry.”

Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu posted on Twitter that an inquiry has been set up to find the cause of the accident. Prabhu also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 3.5 lakh each to the families of those killed, Rs 50,000 to those seriously injured, and Rs 25,000 to those with minor injuries.

Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha left for the accident site from Delhi along with two Railway Board members and other senior officials. Divisional, zonal and ministry officials reached the spot over three hours after the accident. A Railways’ medical van from Saharanpur and an Accident Relief Train from Ambala have reached the spot, officials said.

Officials said rescue and relief operations remained slow due to the darkness and the huge crowd of people that had gathered. But they said all the injured, who were not trapped inside the derailed coaches, had been moved out. They said that two coaches had “capsized”, or toppled over, after derailing.

The UP government and other agencies, including the NDRF, arranged for 65 ambulances, while local residents joined in the relief and rescue operations. Local BJP MP Sanjeev Balyan was one of the first to reach the site to aid initial rescue work, officials said.

State government officials said UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed state ministers Suresh Rana and Satish Mahana to rush to the spot, monitor relief work and arrange medical aid for the injured. “The injured in the rail accident will get proper treatment. Orders issued for all possible help to reach the site,” Adityanath posted on Twitter.

The Chief Minister has also announced financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh each to the families of those killed and Rs 50,000 each to those injured, officials said. “Food packets are being distributed to passengers, and private and state buses have been arranged to ferry them to their destinations,” an official said.

Started in 1969-70, the Kalinga Utkal Express is popular among pilgrims and tourists from Odisha. These coaches are of the older, Integral Coach Factory (ICF) variety, which do not have an anti-climbing feature to prevent a coach from piling on another. Officials said that in case of a collision or derailment, there were chances of higher casualty in these coaches compared to their more modern Linke-Hoffman-Busch counterparts.

There has been a spate of major derailments since last November, when the Indore-Patna Express derailed near Kanpur, killing 150 passengers. The Sealdah Ajmer Express derailed a month later, injuring 63 passengers. In January this year, 32 people died after the Hirakhand Express derailed near Vizianagram in Andhra Pradesh. In all these cases, Railways said that it suspected sabotage. The National Investigation Agency is probing these accidents.

According to official data, 2016-17 saw 99 accidents which involved casualties — track defects were detected in 40 of these accidents.

Chinese Nobel laureate widow Liu Xia makes first appearance since funeral,"In this undated handout photo, Nobel Prize laureate late Liu Xiaobo, left, is attended to by his wife Liu Xia in a hospital in China. (Photo via AP, File) In this undated handout photo, Nobel Prize laureate late Liu Xiaobo, left, is attended to by his wife Liu Xia in a hospital in China. (Photo via AP, File)

The widow of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo has appeared for the first time since her husband’s funeral in an online video in which she said she was recuperating and asked for time to mourn. Liu Xia had been under effective house arrest since her husband, a prominent dissident since the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, won the Nobel prize in 2010. He died on July 13 after being denied permission to leave the country for treatment of late-stage liver cancer.

Liu Xia had been allowed to visit him in prison about once a month and to remain with him while he was treated in his final days.

However, friends of the couple have told Reuters that they have been unable to speak with her since after her husband’s funeral, after which they say she returned to Beijing and has been staying with a friend.

In a roughly one minute-long video posted on YouTube on Friday, Liu Xia speaks directly to the camera while holding a lit cigarette. She was sitting on a white sofa in front of a pot of tea in what appeared to be the living room of a home.

“I am outside recuperating, everyone please grant me time to mourn, time for my heart to heal and one day I will be able to face you all in a healthy state,” she said. It was not immediately clear what she meant by “outside”.

“The doctors tried their best when Xiaobo was ill and Xiaobo also viewed life and death very plainly. So I must recalibrate, and in future when I have made improvements in different aspects, I can be with you all again.”

Reuters was not able to verify whether she made the comments of her own free will or her location.

The video was uploaded by user “goudan li”, who joined YouTube on July 6, 2017. Other videos uploaded by the user were ones alleging wrongdoings by fugitive tycoon Guo Wengui. “Goudan li” did not immediately respond to Reuters’ messages on the video.

Chinese authorities have said that Liu Xia was free and have told diplomats who asked about her whereabouts that her lack of communication was due to her desire to mourn in peace.

Before the death of her husband, Liu Xia had told diplomats and friends that she wished to leave China should Liu Xiaobo be released.

Jared Genser, a human rights lawyer based in the United States who had advocated for Liu Xiaobo and his wife, filed a formal complaint on the behalf of Liu Xia with the U.N. Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances in early August.

China’s Ministry of Public Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was not possible to contact the Ministry of State Security as it has no website or publicly available telephone number.

Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2009 for “inciting subversion of state power” after he helped write a petition known as “Charter 08” calling for sweeping political reforms.

"Our Stories, Their Stories: When an Indian and a Pakistani walk into a coffee shop in a foreign land","These conversations, if they happen, take us out of our comfort zones. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar) These conversations, if they happen, take us out of our comfort zones. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)

Here in Sydney, I have met a lot of Pakistanis. Contrary to what we have been made to believe, we get along well. Why? I think it is because far away from our mulks, the baggage of history seems a bit lighter. We don’t have to flaunt and feign patriotism by turning against the other. In faraway lands, our patriotism isn’t defined by hating the other as easily as it is in our respective countries.

It isn’t a way to counter racism — a “white vs brown” thing. At least, not yet in my case.

Is it because, mostly, we speak the same language? Maybe, yes. It could also be because we eat the same food. Does it matter when my Pakistani neighbours make kadi pakora they can share with us? I think it does. Sometimes, I think inherently we are the same.

So what defines this “sameness”? Is it a few big things coming together or too many trivial things that are difficult to keep count of? That we use the same cuss words and stock the same masalas in our kitchen cabinets? Or the bigger similarities: we have the same kind of media that fans the same kind of fires amongst us, provoked by politicians who play the same games, on both sides of our borders?

I was returning from Sydney Cricket Ground the other night. My Uber driver happened to be a young man from Karachi. After a few minutes, he opened up and we were talking like old friends. He hadn’t been to Karachi in eight years, since he arrived in Australia. These years, he says, were a revelation to him. The media back home had poisoned him against Indians, he said, but here he found us Indians to be just like them Pakistanis.

At the end of the ride, I asked him for a favour: to take something of me to Pakistan, when he visits Karachi at the end of this month. He was surprised. What could I be sending? And to whom? Who did I know there? I told him to take dher sara pyaar from this fellow Indian for his friends and family. That we need love between us and he could be that messenger. “Sure”, he said, “we are the same.”

But, maybe, we are not.

Well, for many of us, our mazhabs are different. But that’s not it. The problem, Indians have been told, is Pakistan itself. Here, though, if our communities try to mingle with each other, brotherhood does not seem too difficult. But if we get too close, the suspicions surface eventually. “That Indian fellow, he sent some chicken xacuti and claimed that it is halal meat. But is it really?” We trust each other and then we don’t.

Or when it comes to the wars, and Kashmir. Every time you hear that the other side has violated the ceasefire on LoC, try opening a website, any reputed news website, from the other side. You will see the inverse version. The two news reports won’t have a single thing in common (except, of course, guns firing and people dying).

On Kashmir, the unshakeable belief is that your own country and your own army is doing nothing wrong. The other side is always to blame. But we, mere citizens forced by circumstances in a foreign land, choose to ignore these issues and carry on.

If you make us talk about it, the layers of suspicion and mistrust slowly become evident. The propaganda of generations of politics, narrated by generations of editors, journalists and historians (for each nation writes its own version of history) to generation of uncles and chachas and nanas and dadas, over and over, has been cemented and fixed in our minds.

When a Pakistani colleague and I met over a cup of coffee and tried discussing politics, it was like putting the very basics of my strongly held beliefs to test. The stories they have heard on their side are just as one-sided as ours. Eventually, we realised that we are all reluctantly loitering in the grey areas here.

These conversations, if they happen, take us out of our comfort zones. My friend from Karachi went on: “Look, I understand. You call Muslims invaders. We invaded your land and ruled it for 400 years and when we left, we took away a piece of it and called it Pakistan — it is not fair but it happened. Par ab kya? It has been 70 years. Can’t we move on?”

I gulped, tried not to look startled and asked myself, how does one prepare for plainspeak like this? This is not Facebook or Twitter. The stakes are much higher than your typically timid and fickle social media timeline that changes loyalties with every hashtag. These are real conversations and we are real people — we work, attend meetings, eat lunch together and wish each other on our respective Independence days.

Meanwhile, we realise, yet again, that we aren’t the same.

The unlearning that we have to do, if we choose to do, is colossal. And with every passing generation, it becomes more difficult. It can happen when we talk to someone from the other side — something practically impossible in our respective countries. But, here, in a foreign land, we meet by circumstance and are bound by it. We talk with each other, first because we need to and then because we want to. And, as we talk, we can see ourselves being deconstructed. When that happens, yes, we are the same.

Then, of course, there is the matter of patriotism. If you are patriotic, you can’t be nice to anyone from the other side. It makes you a traitor. The other day, a woman from Pakistan asked Minister for External Affairs Sushma Swaraj for help on Twitter — a visa request to treat her two-year-old son, who needed an urgent bone marrow transplant. Few “proud” Indians, as they generally are, replying to her tweet, asked her why she did not go to China to seek assistance. Some Pakistanis shamed her for “begging” medical facilities from India. A two-year-old boy is fighting for life and Twitter warriors from India and Pakistan are defining patriotism. So yes, I guess, we are the same.

It does not matter if you are an Indian or a Pakistani who is reading this, because the question for us, aam janta, remains the same. How long will we let our patriotism be defined by hate?

Well, the guys handling the Mumbai Police Twitter handle have time and again not only proved their mettle in the humour department but also in quickly responding to distress tweets by Mumbaikars, especially when it comes to stalking and eve-teasing. Not only that, they then use the incident to warn anyone else who might have similar ideas. The most recent incident was on August 17, when a media professional reached out to the Police with a photo of two unidentified men on a bike who were following her. She later tagged Mumbai Police with the photos of the stalkers and the bike’s registration number.

According to an ANI report, she called up the Mumbai Police Control Room for help after which they quickly swung into action. The police kept the track of her route. The woman also shot the pictures of the accused and tweeted a photograph of the two stalkers on the Mumbai police handle and later thanked police for her response.

Briton hailed as hero for comforting Spain attack victim,"Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain’s King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) Police check a drain outside a hospital where Spain’s King Felipe is due to visit some of the injured victims of the van attack in Barcelona , Spain, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

A 44-year-old Briton, believed to be of Indian-origin, is being hailed as a hero after he risked his life to comfort a young victim of the terror attack in Spain in which a van ploughed into pedestrians, media reports said. Harry Athwal, from Birmingham, had been holidaying in Spain last week when the attackers drove down Las Ramblas, Barcelona, at speed, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 other.

Without considering his own safety, Athwal ran from the first floor restaurant where he was dining to the pavement and cradled a young boy who had been struck by the van, The Mirror reported. He was seen comforting the boy at the site of the attack with a photo of them going viral as a terrible symbol of the destruction wrought by extremists on the city’s freedom. Athwal ran up to the boy as the terrorist’s van swerved mindlessly past, despite the bodies being thrown high in the air and cries from police to stay back for his own safety.

Later, at a hotel, recovering from the harrowing experience, Athwal told the daily that he cast aside all thoughts for his own safety in that moment because the boy suddenly became in his eyes, his own son. As such, he could not leave him alone to suffer, or to be mowed down again by the terrorists should they reverse callously back down the street.

“He was unconscious, his leg was bent the wrong way, there was blood coming out of his head, I knew it was more than blood. I was checking for a pulse and he didn’t have one,” Athwal said. “I put my hand on his back and I thought he had gone. I was stroking his hair and in floods of tears but I stayed with him, I sat there because I was not going to leave this child in the middle of the road,” he said.

“The police were telling me to move but I would not leave him. All the time I was thinking the terrorists could come back but I was not leaving that child. To me, he looked like my own son. He was my son’s age, seven or eight. I just ran my hands through his hair, it was about comforting him,” Athwal added. The project manager, who lives with this wife Harjinder and sons Diernn, aged 19, and Khye, 8, also told the daily of how he had not even planned to visit Barcelona last week.

He visited with his own family, including his son, Khye, to celebrate the eight-year-old’s birthday earlier this month. But when his sister invited him to join her and friends in a spontaneous trip he agreed.

The group could not check into their rooms straight away when they arrived on Thursday, so decided to have a late lunch on Las Ramblas. They nearly ate down the middle of the pedestrianised street, exactly in the terrorist’s path, but a persuasive waiter luckily tempted them to try his restaurant on a first floor balcony. It was from there they watched the horrifying killing spree unfurl. Spanish police believe 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub drove the van through the crowded street.

We as support staff are always looking for ways to improve and welcome any advice from former players: Darren Lehmann,"Darren Lehmann also hoped that he could clear misconceptions surrounding workloads and availability. (Source: File) Darren Lehmann also hoped that he could clear misconceptions surrounding workloads and availability. (Source: File)

Ahead of the tough schedule in the coming months, Australian coach Darren Lehmann has called for former players to pass on their experience to help Australia succeed in the near future.

In a letter published by News Corp Australia, Lehmann says, We as support staff are always looking for ways to improve and welcome any advice from you, so if you have any ideas, however ‘out there’ they might be, please reply. Your advice is always helpful. After all, we as players both the past and present don’t have all the answers and as support staff, we are always looking for the best way to drive us forward in the game.

“If at any stage you would like to come into the change rooms or come along to training and see how we do things and prepare, please let us know and we can facilitate the process. The players and staff love seeing you guys around and talking through the game you played.

Lehmann also hoped that he could clear misconceptions surrounding workloads and availability. Commenting on it he said, “As for training, I know there is a lot of talk about bowling workloads etc, and I can say that we always have enough bowling taking place at training for the quicks to get better and the batters to make sure they are getting enough so the misconception sometimes is that they don’t bowl enough.

“This is not the case at the highest level. We are focusing on our skills now with an emphasis on being able to withstand the pressure and create pressure of our own against a variety of opponents throughout the year, both home and away.”, he concluded.

Allow coconuts in jail during Hindu festivals: Convict’s plea in Gujarat High Court,"A convict serving life sentence at the Sabarmati Jail has moved the Gujarat High Court seeking permission to bring coconut inside the jail during Hindu festivals. He has said that without any notification the jail authorities, a month and a half ago, prohibited the supply of coconut from outside.

The petitioner Gautam Ramanuj, a resident of Khadia, is serving life term for his role in the 1997 abduction case of Manish Shah in Bharuch for a Rs 1 crore ransom.

Ramanuj’s advocate Piyush Baseri said, “The jail authorities think that coconuts can be used to supply bombs. But there are at least three layers of checking that the jail authorities do everyday. Our contention is to let coconuts be brought inside the jail after thorough checking.” He added that Hindu prisoners can not offer prayers without coconuts.

The High Court has issued notices to Inspector General of Police (prisons) and Jail Superintendent seeking their replies on the issue.

President Donald Trump’s close aide Steve Bannon has advocated a tougher stance toward China asserting that the US is at economic war with it, prompting Beijing to warn that “there is no winner in a trade war”.

“We’re at economic war with China,” Chief White House Strategist Steve Bannon told The American Prospect.

Of late media reports have said that Bannon is pushing for a strong policy against China. Many within the Trump Administration differ with him. “To me the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we’re five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we’ll never be able to recover,” Bannon said in response to a question.

The Chief White House Strategist said the United States would take a strong action against China. “We’re going to run the tables on these guys. We’ve come to the conclusion that they’re in an economic war and they’re crushing us,” said Bannon who once headed the right-wing Breitbart News.

Commenting on his remarks, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying in Beijing warned that “there is no winner in a trade war” and appealed for dialogue. “We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century,” she said.

In his interview over phone, Bannon argued that there was no military solution to North Korean provocative behaviour. “There’s no military solution (to North Korea’s nuclear threats), forget it. Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don’t die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don’t know what you’re talking about, there’s no military solution here, they got us,” Bannon said.

On Monday, Trump signed an executive order asking the US Trade Representative for examination of Chinese policies, practices, and actions with regard to the forced transfers of US technology and the theft of its intellectual property. “The theft of intellectual property by foreign countries costs our nation millions of jobs and billions and billions of dollars each and every year. For too long, this wealth has been drained from our country while Washington has done nothing,” Trump said.

In the interview, Bannon said that he is getting hawks placed at key position. At the same time he acknowledged that he is getting opposition from various section. “That’s a fight I fight every day here,” he said.

“We’re still fighting. There’s Treasury and [National Economic Council chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying,” he added. “We gotta do this. The president’s default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don’t get me wrong. It’s like, every day,” Bannon said.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the Haryana government to ensure free school education to the child born to a 13-year-old gang rape survivor in Mewat district. The High Court has also asked the state government to pay a sum of Rs 4 lakh to the rape survivor as compensation.

Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain, in the judgment dated August 9 in the case filed in October last year, has directed the government to deposit Rs 3 lakh in the shape of FDR for sustenance of the child. “The victim shall be allowed to keep on withdrawing interest every month for the purpose of sustenance of the said child and shall withdraw the FDR only after attaining the age of majority by the said child,” Jain said.

The minor rape survivor had moved the High Court last year in October seeking termination of the pregnancy but the plea had been turned down by the court after a medical report said the patient is 26 weeks pregnant, which is beyond the permissible limits for termination. The rape survivor had later filed an application with different prayers under which she had sought directions for compensation and proper medical care.

Vishal Sikka’s exit saddens Infosys’ young staff; a section sees silver lining,"Infosys Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Vishal Sikka (AP Photo) Infosys Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Vishal Sikka (AP Photo)

Despite being at the helm of affairs at Infosys Ltd for only three years, outgoing CEO Vishal Sikka has managed to endear himself to the majority of employees, especially the young employees, with his measures and new ideas that made the average employee felt valued and empowered. With Sikka announcing his exit as CEO and MD of the company on Friday, the overwhelming sense is one of sadness and uncertainty among young employees, especially for those who bought into Sikka’s dreamy, futuristic strategic vision for the company.However, for a section of employees, who do some of the heavy-lifting at the company, the exit of the CEO amid a cloud of controversy over acquisitions and pay hikes is probably welcome, as Sikka’s strategies were set to take the company away from its traditional ways.

“I thought with Sikka in charge, we were in good hands. There was a sense of purpose and direction to the work we were doing and employees who had grown lethargic and shackled by rules that stipulated a formal dress code and fixed work hours were enjoying working in Infosys. We are hoping that these things do not change with Sikka gone,” said a non-technical employee who has been at Infosys for over 10 years.“There is a sense of uncertainty among the employees. They do not know what is going to happen now. There was a specific transformation path that was taken under Sikka and this will definitely change under a new leader,” a senior software engineer at the company said.

Sikka, who brought a slice of Silicon Valley culture to Infosys campuses with his deep knowledge of technology and science, an informal personal style where he wore t-shirts to work or walked barefoot on the lawns of the Infosys campus obliging requests for selfies, enjoyed the status of a “rock star” among the younger lot of the two lakh-strong employees.“With his connections in Silicon Valley and higher education in the US, we felt Sikka was successful in positioning Infosys as an emerging technology company and not just a services company. This would have been good for the company in the long run and whether this can be achieved by anyone else is very doubtful,” the senior software engineer said.

“Every part of the company, every campus and every client would speak about the new thinking you brought to Infosys. Your lectures on AI and innovative thought leadership would always be with us. We are going to miss a great person at heart, great CEO with passion for machines, robots, cognitive thinking,” an Infosys employee said in response to Sikka’s communication on his blog about his exit. “Sometimes I felt you are a misfit for this company as your ideas and plans are way too high/good to be implemented in Infosys with this set of people,” said another employee on Sikka’s blog.

A section of employees are, however, not very downcast about the change of guard and are of the view that there is substance to rumours of wrong doing that has been swirling around since the end of the first year of Vishal Sikka’s tenure. “After Sikka took over, employees received good hikes following appraisals but in the last year, there have been no hikes and this has been demoralising especially after learning that some of the top management including Sikka received huge 55 per cent hikes,” a software engineer said. “The camps are divided — old thinking versus new thought leadership. Looks like this time old thinking has won,” an Infosys employee said about the exit of Sikka. “I sensed dope when I saw that Infosys was paying $200 million for the Panaya acquisition. Sikka will not be missed,” an Infosys employee said.

Crime Branch team busts Noida call centre ‘duping’ people in Mumbai with fake policies,"THE MUMBAI Crime Branch has claimed to have busted an “illegal” call centre in Noida from where a gang of eight allegedly duped people in Mumbai through fraudulent calls.

According to the police, the eight arrested have duped people on the pretext of investing in insurance policies. So far, police have found Rs 2 crore that the accused are suspected to have earned over the last few years.

The accused include two former employees of insurance companies, who had stolen customer data from five insurance companies. They used this database to target customers by calling them and offering them various options for investing into new insurance policies.

Deputy Police Commissioner Nisar Tamboli said, “The accused would call people and offer profitable insurance policies with attractive gifts. The offer would be so irresistible that several people fell for it.”

The accused have been identified as Kaptansingh Chauhan alias Bobby alias Sandeep Gupta, 26, Anilsingh Rahatat, 24, Rajnathsinh Chauhan, 19, Aashish Gupta, 30, Harish Goswami, 28, Anil Tiwari, alias Raja, 20, Upendra Bhadoriya, 23 and Rinku Solanki, 24.

Arrested in Noida, the accused were produced before a magistrate on Saturday.

Kaptansinh and Gupta had stolen database of insurance customers from their former companies, said police.

“Solanki, who had previously worked with a mobile phone company, would procure SIM cards on forged identities. The cards were used only to make calls and would be otherwise kept switched off,” added an official.

The Crime Branch had began investigation into the case after a complaint of a man being duped of Rs 22.02 lakh between 2015 and 2017 was lodged with the department.

The accused have been booked for cheating, forgery, acts of common intention and criminal breach of trust as per the provisions of Indian Penal Code and they have been remanded to police custody till August 24, added an official.

"Sania Mirza, Rohan Bopanna exit Cincinnati Open","Rohan Bopanna and Ivan Dodig conceded their serve twice in the supertiebreak. (Source: Express Photo) Rohan Bopanna and Ivan Dodig conceded their serve twice in the supertiebreak. (Source: Express Photo)

Both remaining Indian players in the Cincinnati main draw exited on Friday after playing some enthralling tennis ahead of the US Open. Sania Mirza and her partner Shuai Peng lost to Hsieh Su-Wei and Moncia Niculescu 4-6, 6-7 in the women’s doubles semis while Rohan Bopanna and Ivan Dodig lost to 1-6, 7-6, 7-10 to second seeded Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo in the quarter-final. The women’s contest lasted an hour and 33 minutes while Bopanna/Dodig pushed Kubot/Melo for nearly the same time (one hour and 36 minutes).

In the men’s doubles match, Bopanna and Dodig were broken twice in a row as Kubot/Melo won five games in a row to win the opening set. The Polish-Brazilian pairing earned and converted the sole set point that came their way. The second set didn’t see any break of serve with just two break points for Bopanna/Dodig. In the tiebreak, the Indo-Croatian pairing squandered two set point chances but eventually got the job done. In the decisive set – the supertiebreak, Bopanna and Dodig handed a minibreak to Kubot/Melo but drew right back to make it level at 4-4. But Bopanna/Dodig lose their serve once again on the next attempt and things remained that way for Melo/Kubot to win.

They will next take on Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares in the semifinal. The other semifinal sees Ryan Harrison/Michael Venus take on Pierre-Hugues Herbert/Nicolas Mahut.

Earlier in the week, in the men’s singles, Ramkumar Ramanathan had lost in the second round (to Jared Donaldson) while Leander Paes and his German partner Alexander Zverev had exited in the first round of men’s doubles.

No Fond Return of Love,"Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part. Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part.

Title: Men Without Women

Author: Haruki Murakami

Publishers: Harvill Secker/Penguin Random House

228 pages

“Loneliness seeps deep down inside your body, like a red-wine stain on a pastel carpet,” says the narrator of the titular story of Men Without Women. The men in c’s heart-rending new book of short stories are all stained — be it by loneliness, their deficiencies or the phantom pain from a wonderfully innocent first love. These indelible marks act as a common strand as the author plays through all seven stories, hitting blue notes aplenty along the way.

In the ever-changing world of Murakami’s writing, there are a few assurances — most characters will have musical tastes ranging from Schubert to The Beatles, solace is often found in bars and good food, cats are a shining ray of hope in a universe that rations it out grudgingly. The most important assurance, however, is that happiness and meaning will be hard to find and even harder to keep.

For many characters, the search that ensues is the driving force that pushes their fractured selves forward. Such a quest — be it literal as in The Wind Up Bird Chronicles (1997), or metaphorical, as with Kafka on the Shore (2005) — is often the only hint of proactivity in an otherwise bland, almost dispassionate, array of protagonists. The latest collection begins with Drive My Car — a reference to The Beatles and the story of Kafuku, a middle-aged actor and widower, whose wife had affairs throughout the span of their marriage. Tortured by the knowledge of the affairs, what Kafuku seeks more than anything else is to know why. Such a curiousity is, in Murakami’s world, a powerful, arbitrary force devoid of a place on any moral scale.

Perhaps, one of the biggest triumphs of the book is the ease with which Murakami indulges in tragicomedy, maneuvering between the two genres effortlessly. In The Independent Organ, the protagonist speaks of successful cosmetic surgeon Dr Tokai. A 52-year-old confirmed bachelor, Tokai is content to remain “the casual number-two lover, a convenient rainy-day boyfriend, a handy partner for a casual fling”. That is, until, he falls in love with a young, married woman, who eventually ends their affair, leaving the doctor to grapple desperately with a suffocating sense of loss for the very first time. The narrator mocks and empathises with Tokai in equal measure — this narrative tone prevaricates between dark and light in stories such as Kino or Yesterday as well.

While a Murakami short story can be seen as a condensed version of his much lengthier novels, earlier collections such as The Elephant Vanishes (1993) seem to wrestle with challenges in form, struggling not to sacrifice pace for form or flair for substance. Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part. This is not to suggest a dearth of experiments, however. Two particularly intriguing tales — Scheherazade and Samsa in Love — are also among the more fantastical and dream-like. The former falls into the category of works such as Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World (1985), in that key plot elements can be seen as representative of the narrative structure.

The story that best puts the “magical” in magical realism is Samsa in Love, a play on Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis (1915). Thrust into an “ill-formed, fragile, ludicrous” human body, an insect must come to terms with his new physical and metaphysical realities. The narration is languid and almost directionless at points, as it explores Samsa being thrust into the world of human interactions with the arrival of a hunchbacked female locksmith at the house he is in, with little idea of even the concept of lust or romantic interest.

When it comes to a central component in Murakami’s exploration of loneliness and curiosity, which are, by nature, deeply intertwined with notions of love and lust, a level of indulgence on the part of readers is undoubtedly necessary. Within the Americanophilic, dream-like worlds that the author builds, there is a thin line between the confidently-paced and “get to the point already!” This line tends to be a divisive one, placing most readers firmly in one camp or the other.

Those who find the indulgence to stroll along this narrative path, however, will likely find themselves in a space one character refers to as the “unrealness of reality”. Left adrift here, in the beguiling space where the author thrives, readers will have to find their own way out. A few, if they’re lucky enough, might chance across a cat or two along the way.

Steve Bannon returns to Breitbart after being sacked by Donald Trump,"Critics had accused Steve Bannon of harboring anti-Semitic and white nationalist sentiments.

President Donald Trump on Friday fired his chief strategist Steve Bannon in the latest White House shake-up, removing a far-right architect of his 2016 election victory and a driving force behind his nationalist and anti-globalization agenda.

Bannon’s firing, a year and a day after Trump hired him as his campaign chief, put an abrupt end to the rabble-rousing political provocateur’s tumultuous tenure in a White House riven with rivalries and back-stabbing during which he clashed with more-moderate factions.

He was instrumental in some of Trump’s most contentious policy moves including the ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries, abandoning the Paris climate accord, tearing up international trade agreements and cracking down on illegal immigration. He was no friend of the Republican political establishment and was loathed by liberals but was a darling of some of the president’s hard-line conservative supporters.

White House officials said Trump had told new Chief of Staff John Kelly to crack down on the bickering and infighting, and that Bannon’s fate was sealed by comments published on Wednesday in the American Prospect liberal magazine in which he spoke of targeting his adversaries within the administration.

Trump, seven months into his presidency, has become increasingly isolated over his comments following white supremacist violence in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville last Saturday and his attacks on fellow Republicans. Some Republicans had even begun questioning Trump’s capacity to govern. As Trump came under fire from Republicans including two former presidents, and from business leaders and US allies abroad, he faced mounting calls for Bannon’s ouster. Critics had accused Bannon of harboring anti-Semitic and white nationalist sentiments. “White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve’s last day,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

Bannon returned to his post as executive chairman of right-wing Breitbart News on Friday afternoon, the website said. Prior to joining the Trump campaign, he had spearheaded Breitbart’s shift into a forum for the “alt-right,” a loose online confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.

Bannon said his departure from the White House signals a major shift for the Trump agenda. “The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,” Bannon told the conservative Weekly Standard. “I just think his ability to get anything done – particularly the bigger things, like the wall, the bigger, broader things that we fought for, it’s just gonna be that much harder,” Bannon said.

He said he would use Breitbart to attack opponents of the populist and nationalist agenda he championed, including establishment Republicans. “I am definitely going to crush the opposition,” Bannon said. He became the latest key figure to abruptly depart a Trump White House that has been chaotic from its first days and already has lost a chief of staff, a national security adviser, two communications directors and a chief spokesman.

Trump’s presidency also has been dogged by ongoing investigations in Congress and a special counsel named by the Justice Department into potential collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia, something both Trump and Moscow deny. Bannon, 63, is a former US Navy officer, Goldman Sachs investment banker and Hollywood movie producer.

He had been in a precarious position before but Trump opted to keep him, in part because he had played a major role in Trump’s November 2016 election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton and was backed by many of the president’s most loyal rank-and-file supporters. Democrats cheered Bannon’s departure.

“Steve Bannon’s firing is welcome news,” said Nancy Pelosi, the top House of Representatives Democrat. “The Trump Administration must not only purge itself of the remaining white supremacists on staff, but abandon the bigoted ideology that clearly governs its decisions.”

MARKETS REACT

Wall Street indexes and the US dollar ended a volatile session lower after a week of drama in Washington intensified doubts about Trump’s ability to deliver on policy objectives such as tax cuts. After a late-morning boost following reports of Bannon’s ouster, the dollar and US equities lost ground. Bannon felt a close ideological connection to Trump’s populist tendencies and “America First” message. Like Trump, he has also expressed deep skepticism concerning ongoing American military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The decision to fire Bannon could undermine Trump’s support among far-right voters but might ease tensions within the White House and with party leaders. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress but have been unable to pass major legislative goals including a healthcare overhaul.

Trump ran into trouble after saying anti-racism demonstrators in Charlottesville were as responsible for the violence as the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who instigated the protests, and that there were “very fine people” among both groups. Those remarks sparked rebukes from fellow Republicans, top corporate executives and some close allies.

Bannon’s departure removes a large source of friction on the White House staff, but does not herald a significant shift by Trump toward the center on major policy issues, three administration officials said. “A good deal of what was attributed to Bannon, for example on China trade and restricting immigration, and the border wall, all came before Bannon joined the campaign and would have happened without him,” said one White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Bannon has been a hawk on China, urging a tougher line on trade to correct a huge trade imbalance and dismissive of recent efforts to try to elicit Beijing’s help to rein in North Korea. In his comments to American Prospect, Bannon said the United States was in an economic war with China.

A second official said the biggest winners from Bannon’s departure are national security adviser H.R. McMaster; Gary Cohn, Trump’s chief economic adviser; and Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. Bannon’s departure cast a cloud over the future of the group of allies he had brought into the White House, such as Sebastian Gorka.

Some conservative activists expressed disappointment in Bannon’s ouster. Republicans were largely quiet, though moderate Republican congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said she was glad Bannon was out but that the administration “must work to build bridges, not destroy them.”

By the time Trump had hired Bannon as campaign manager, the real estate magnate had already vanquished his Republican opponents for the party’s presidential nomination. Asked about Bannon on Tuesday, Trump called him “a friend of mine” but downplayed his contribution to his election victory.

“Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 senators, governors and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that. And I like him. He is a good man. He is not a racist,” Trump said.

Vikas Krishan let off with warning for Asian Championships forfeiture,"The middleweight (75kg) boxer, who was the top seed in the Asian meet in Tashkent, had given a walkover to Korean Lee Dongyun in the semifinal during the April 30 to May 7 event. (Source: Express Archive) The middleweight (75kg) boxer, who was the top seed in the Asian meet in Tashkent, had given a walkover to Korean Lee Dongyun in the semifinal during the April 30 to May 7 event. (Source: Express Archive)

World Championships-bound Indian boxer Vikas Krishan has been let off with a warning for forfeiting his Asian Championships semifinal bout earlier this year, marking an end to the disciplinary inquiry against him.

The middleweight (75kg) boxer, who was the top seed in the Asian meet in Tashkent, had given a walkover to Korean Lee Dongyun in the semifinal during the April 30 to May 7 event.

The 25-year-old, a former World Championships bronze- medallist, is currently in Hamburg, Germany with the eight-member Indian team which will compete in the upcoming edition of the mega-event, starting August 25.

“He has been given a warning for what happened and the matter is now closed. The disciplinary panel spoke to him and we came to the conclusion that a warning would suffice,” a top Boxing Federation of India (BFI) told PTI on condition of anonymity.

The boxer, who had a World Series of Boxing (WSB) bout on May 11 in Paris, had claimed that he got caught up in a confusion over his travel plans, which led to him forfeiting

the Asian Championship bout.

Subsequently, the BFI denied him permission to compete in the WSB bout as well.

The BFI then constituted a three-member disciplinary committee to conduct an inquiry into the matter.

The committee, headed by veteran administrator Asit Banerjee and comprising Rajesh Bhandari and Nirwan Mukherjee, met Vikas and the coaches who had travelled with the Indian team in Tashkent and some BFI officials before submitting its report in July.

It is learnt, the disciplinary panel did not squarely blame Vikas for the fiasco and pointed out “lack of communication” between him and officials as the reason for the “confusion” that led to the forfeiture.

The Haryana-boxer is among the most decorated boxers in India. A two-time Olympian, he became the first Indian to be adjudged the best boxer by the International Boxing

Association (AIBA) at its annual gala last year.

He is also an Asian Games gold-medallist besides being a former world youth champion.

"Nikkei dragged to 3-month low by weaker Wall Street, stronger yen","The Nikkei was down 1 per cent at 19,501.53 points by the end of morning trading, putting it on track to lose 1.2 percent for the week.

* Nikkei joins global sell-off, falls 1 percent.

* Wall Street logs losses as U.S. political woes rattle investors

* Insurance, banks, securities shares lead losses

Japan’s Nikkei share average skidded to three-month lows on Friday, pressured by losses on Wall Street and a weaker dollar as doubts grow over whether President Donald Trump will be able to push through policies to boost U.S. economic growth.

The Nikkei was down 1 per cent at 19,501.53 points by the end of morning trading, putting it on track to lose 1.2 percent for the week.

U.S. stocks sold off on Thursday, with the S&P 500 logging its biggest daily percentage drop in three months, as escalating worries about the Trump administration’s ability to deliver on its economic promises rattled investors.

An attack in Spain added to the risk-averse move, after a van mowed through crowds of tourists in Barcelona and killed at least 13 people, with Islamic State claiming responsibility.

Domestic concerns weighed as well. While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s support rose this month after he reshuffled his cabinet, investors continue to gauge the impact of his support levels on Japan’s currency.

“The signature trade on the back of Abenomics is shorting yen, and therefore, the fragility of the government is giving more reason for the yen to appreciate,” said Kyoya Okazawa, head of institutional clients, APAC at BNP Paribas Securities.

“People feel more yen appreciation pressure at this moment, and that is obviously putting pressure on the Nikkei.”

The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 109.41 yen, extending its 0.6 percent drop on Thursday.

“Earnings results season was okay, but geopolitical risk really cast a shadow over it, because the tension between the U.S. and North Korea is a never-ending story,” which also bolstered the perceived safe-haven yen, Okazawa said.

While the fiery rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang has calmed down, concerns remain that tension could again flare up on the Korean peninsula.

The United States and Japan will step up their defense cooperation to deal with the threat from nuclear-armed North Korea, officials from the two allies said on Thursday.

Banks and financial shares underperformed, with the banking subindex down 1.5 percent, the insurance subindex losing 2.1 percent, and the securities subindex 1.7 percent lower at midday.

Mizuho Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group the first- and second-most traded issues by volume, fell 1.1 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively.

"PV Sindhu, Kidambi Srikanth carry India’s hopes at World Badminton Championships","PV Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth will lead India’s campaign at Badminton World Championships. PV Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth will lead India’s campaign at Badminton World Championships.

India will go into the World Badminton Championships, that begins on Monday, with a 21-member strong contingent hoping for an elusive gold in the tournament. All eyes will be on in-form Kidambi Srikanth and Rio silver medallist PV Sindhu, who has won bronze at the tournament on two different occasions.

Srikanth will hope to continue his title winning streak to clinch a maiden World Championship medal after back to back title wins at Indonesia Open and Australia Open.

Sindhu, who has also won two titles after her Olympic silver, will be hoping to better her podium finish, having already won bronze in 2013 and 2014. She will be playing either Korea’s Kim Hyo Min or Egypt’s Hadia Hosny in the second round after entering the tournament with a bye.

Among other Indians participating in the tournament is Saina Nehwal, who is the first woman from the country to have won a silver in the World Championships, back in 2015. She will hope to put aside her consistent injury concerns when she faces Switzerland’s Sabrina Jaquet or Ukraine’s Natalya Voytsekh, depending on who wins the first round.

Other hopefuls for India include B Sai Praneeth and Sameer Verma. Chief national coach Pullela Gopichand called the players representing India as the strongest squad and said that a strong performance can be expected from them. “This is probably the strongest squad. The men have been doing well in recent times and the four Indian players in the fray are good and capable of beating the best. Nobody is a clear favourite these days and we can expect a strong performance from our players,” he said.

Judwaa 2 actor Taapsee Pannu still feels Friday release pressure,"Taapsee Pannu will next be seen in Judwaa 2. Taapsee Pannu will next be seen in Judwaa 2.

Actor Taapsee Pannu says that she takes “ownership” of every films she works in and therefore feels pressure on every Friday morning whenever her movie is hitting the box office. “Oh I do. I just got the Telugu release last Friday so I do get the pressure because I take the ownership of my films. I just don’t let it go and ride it on other names… that’s why I get that pressure,” Taapsee said the sidelines of Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) Winter/Festive 2017 where she walked for designer Divya Reddy.

Taapsee is currently excited for the trailer launch, on Monday, of her much-awaited film Judwaa 2 where she stars alongside Varun Dhawan and Jacqueline Fernandez. “I am excited to see the reaction. People are going to see my glamorous side in the film. They have to publish the trailer twice to understand if that is me (laughed). I don’t know how they are going to react so I am definitely waiting to see the reaction,” she said.

Divya Reddy made a strong fashion statement when she declared green as the new black, at 6Degree Studio during Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017.

The USP of Divya’s collection was the fabric, which had a great fashion story. The Kolam tribe in the Kawal forest collect cocoons after the flight of the butterflies. These were turned into exquisite silk, spun by using double spun technique, where the broken strands are double spun and stuck together to create strong silk yarn with a slubby nature called Madhepur Tussar.

She used its regal texture for her glorious creations. One of the prime qualities of the fabric is the ability to keep the body warm in winter and cool in summer so Divya’s collection will have a year round appeal and truly long fashion life.

In true show stopper fashion, Tapsee wore the hottest shade of pink, breaking the monotony of the muted tones of green and salmon pink. Wearing a stunning floor-length, long-sleeved, intricately, embellished jacket over a sheer delicately embroidered piece, her outfit was a definite trendsetter for women who want to make their mark in the crowd and look glamorous.

“If she will allow, I can take this outfit and wear it at all the weddings that I have to attend. I genuinely feel that we as an Indians are actually mistaking fashion. Our outfit overpowers the personality… that’s where I feel a lot of us are going wrong and that’s why I keep it simple in a way that my personality needs to gel with the outfit.. it needs to shine out,” Tapsee said

"Gadgets can be addictive like consuming alcohol, says expert","Delegates at the conference in Chandigarh on Saturday. (Express Photo by Jaipal Singh) Delegates at the conference in Chandigarh on Saturday. (Express Photo by Jaipal Singh)

Around 203 delegates from across the country came together to take part in the 13th Annual National Conference of Indian Association of Biological Psychiatry(ANCIABP) got underway Saturday. “The conference has been planned to deliver the most recent advancements in Biological Psychiatry by eminent psychiatrists from across the country,” said a statement.

During the conference, while Dr E Mohandas, Consultant Psychiatrist from Thrissur, Kerala, discussed how the structure and brain circuits are linked with normal and abnormal behaviours (which lead to development of illnesses), Dr Atul Ambekar, Professor of Psychiatry from NDDTC, AIIMS, New Delhi, informed about the problem of cannabis and how it leads to mental health problems.

Dr Avinash Desouza, an expert on Neurobiological effects of gadgets addiction, spoke about how gadgets can be addictive as alcohol. “Gadgets can be addictive. The effect of repeated usage of gadget is similar to consuming alcohol or any substance. The use of gadgets may affect the development of brain among children and may affect the social interactions and aggressive behaviour in adults especially when exposed to violent video games,” he said. “The use of gadgets causes changes in brain circuits that leads to the development of permanent changes affecting emotion and cognition.”

He said that the problem is an “emerging problem” and every week he gets 3-4 such cases in Mumbai. “Children who play video games for a long time show academic decline. The school environment does not interest them compared to the fast action paced environment of video games,” said Desouza. adding, “There is a need for the government to be vigilant about video games that are extremely violent and may compel children to attempt suicide and develop self-injurious behaviour.”

Xiaomi working with Google on a new Android One smartphone: Report,"Xiaomi could be working with Google on a new Android One smartphone. Xiaomi could be working with Google on a new Android One smartphone.

A new report coming from an Indonesian website Kripitech claims that Xiaomi and Google are working closely to bring an Android One smartphone to the market. If true, that means the smartphone will run software based on pure Android.

The report claims the phone will be closer to the company’s Mi 5X, which recently made its debut in China. The phone features a 5.5-inch Full HD display, Snapdragon 625 processor, 4GB RAM, dual cameras, and a 3,080mAh battery. Kripitech believes the phone will be called Xiaomi A1 and the company might re-brand the Mi 5X for the global consumers.

This would be the first time Xiaomi plans to release a smartphone without MIUI, the company’s own UI that’s built on Android. While Xiaomi has traditionally been known for its strength in the budget segment, it’s collaboration with Google to bring an Android One smartphone could help the brand to propel deeper into the Indian smartphone market. Xiaomi continues to be a popular phone vendor in India. Its Redmi Note 4 proved to be a major success – after all, the company sold over 5 million units of the phone in India since the last six months.

For Google also, the relationship with Xiaomi will only benefit the search giant. When you look at Android One, the response from consumers and vendors haven’t been hugely welcoming. Google has a fair idea, and because of this the search engine giant would like to have a strong hardware partner on board. The presence of Xiaomi can create the right hype and excitement in the Android One program.

Of course, it’s worth noting that the report should be taken with a grain of salt. At the moment, both the companies have not provided any evidence that such a device is even coming.

Bareilly Ki Barfi box office collection day 3: Next few days are crucial for Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon starrer,"Bareilly Ki Barfi, after a disappointing opening, has shown signs of success today. But it is still far from the mark where it would be called successful, so it would need to continue its success over the week. The small town romantic comedy, starring Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon, and Rajkummar Rao, has garnered Rs 3.85 crore on Day 2 at the box office. That makes its total collection Rs 6.27 crore which is a marked improvement over its opening day.

Word of mouth might be starting to play a considerable role in this film’s success, and the film would need it. Indianexpress.com’s film critic Shubhra Gupta had given an average review of the film and praised Rajkummar Rao, who is one of the leads. “Rajkummar Rao blows away the weaknesses of this film with his consummate act, playing the timid ‘chota shehari’ on the one hand, and the loud ‘rangbaaz’ on the other. He sweetens the pot, and makes up for the rest of it,” Shubhra had said.

An Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari directorial, Bareilly Ki Barfi is a small town romantic comedy and stars Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon and Rajkummar Rao. Pitted against the film are two important movies as trade analyst Girish Johar had explained. “Toilet: Ek Prem Katha will obviously be a strong contender for them (Bareilly Ki Barfi) this week. Maybe not Partition: 1947, because Gurinder Chadha’s film is for a very small segment of the audience. The Hollywood release Annabelle: Creation has a good brand recall. It also has a strong fan base,” Girish had said.

Bareilly Ki Barfi will most likely do well on Sunday but its real test would be the following weekdays and it will be those days that will determine the fate of Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon, and Rajkummar Rao starrer.

"Utkal Express derailment: Over 50 discharged, 102 still receiving treatment: UP minister","A senior Uttar Pradesh official had said in the morning that 156 people were injured. (Source: PTI Photo) A senior Uttar Pradesh official had said in the morning that 156 people were injured. (Source: PTI Photo)

More than 50 passengers who received injuries in the Muzaffarnagar train accident have been discharged from hospitals while 102 others are still receiving treatment, the Uttar Pradesh government said on Sunday. The Kalinga-Utkal Express had derailed in Muzaffarnagar last evening, killing 21 people. A senior Uttar Pradesh official had said in the morning that 156 people were injured.

“Today more than 50 passengers, who had received minor injuries, were sent to their homes after treatment. The government is extending all possible help to the stranded passengers so that they could reach their destination,” UP Cabinet minister Satish Mahana told PTI. Mahana said he had reached the accident site around 10.00 pm on Saturday.

“Nearly 102 passengers are still receiving treatment in government and private hospitals in Muzaffarnagar and Meerut. Free medicine is being provided to them,” he said.

The state government was also providing food and accommodation to passengers’ relatives who are reaching Muzaffarnagar, he said. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had on Saturday asked senior ministers Suresh Rana and Satish Mahana to reach the accident site. The CM also spoke with the Muzaffarnagar district magistrate and instructed him to ensure all possible relief, an official spokesperson had said.

“Four NDRF teams were also rushed there — three teams from Ghaziabad and one from Delhi. Besides, 35 ambulances, bread and butter, 1,000 food packets, additional private and UPSRTC buses were arranged. Volunteers were mobilised from adjoining Meerut,” the spokeperson had said on Saturday.

(Source: Express Archive)

ISL franchise NorthEast United FC owner John Abraham on Sunday said his team will break-even within next one or two seasons and will become the first one among all the teams.

“NEUFC will be the first team in ISL to break-even. This is the fourth season of ISL and we will break-even in fifth or sixth season. So, it is just one or two more seasons,” Abraham said at a press conference in Guwahati.

Most of the ISL teams are targetting to break-even in the seventh or eighth season, he claimed.

“Within the ISL, when someone talks about template, then they say look at NEUFC. We are working on economy of scale. We are working at the grass root and with local boys. We also prefer local sponsors,” the Bollywood star said.

He further informed that NEUFC is also very reasonable in terms of pricing of tickets during the matches and highly appreciated the support of the government machinery.

“We have a long-term vision. We are here for very very long term. We have already tied up with two clubs in Shillong and in Manipur. We have shortlisted kids and will house them

in a residential academy at Shillong, where all their needs, including education will be taken care of,” Abraham said.

A third partnership is in the offing with a club in Mizoram, he added without sharing the name.

“I am also the brand ambassador of Arunachal Pradesh. Very soon something very very exciting coming up there. It is about football. NEUFC is not just a club. It is a platform to

reiterate the voice of North East,” the actor said.

NEUFC has conducted scouting across Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Manipur and selected 48 kids for trainig them at the residential academy.

Asked about merger of I-League and ISL, Abraham said it does not look possible at present, but a has to be taken by the higher management.

The ISL franchise owner also said he is reaching out to all the North Eastern state governments to tie up for encouraging tourism in the region.

Talking about Indian football, Abraham said: “Indian football still has to develop. Foreign players are coming up and it is exciting for Indian players. Infrastructure has to be developed. If you ask me, football is not cricket yet, but it will be new cricket in a period of time.”

Afghan security forces were on high alert today as the war-weary country, reeling from a number of high-profile deadly attacks, prepared to mark its independence day with muted celebrations. There was an increased police presence in the capital Kabul where pop star Aryana Sayeed had vowed to give a concert and President Ashraf Ghani was due to host a private ceremony for Afghan dignitaries. “All of our police units are on the highest state of alert and they are placed everywhere across the city,” Kabul police spokesman Abdul Basir Mujahid told AFP.

“We have increased the number of police checkpoints in and around the diplomatic quarters (too),” he added, amid fears that the Taliban would mark the anniversary with a large-scale attack.

August 19 commemorates the signing of the Treaty of Rawalpindi in 1919, which granted Afghanistan full independence from Britain, although the country was never part of the British empire, after three bloody wars. While Afghanistan’s red, black and green tricolour flag adorned many Kabul streets, the day will largely go unobserved by ordinary Afghans, who are frustrated by the deteriorating security situation and the lack of progress by the US-led international coalition forces.

As in recent years there are no public ceremonies planned in the capital.

The city has been on edge since a massive truck bomb ripped through its diplomatic quarter during morning rush hour on May 31, killing about 150 and wounding around 400 people, mostly civilians, in an unclaimed attack.

Taliban insurgents are currently at the peak of their summer fighting season and have launched several deadly assaults around the country in recent weeks.

Ghani is scheduled to welcome dozens of Afghan officials for a morning ceremony at the presidential palace. He will deliver a speech and lay a wreath at the independence minaret inside the defence ministry compound, defence ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri told AFP.

While some Afghans changed their Facebook profile pictures to the Afghan flag or to Amanullah Khan, the king who secured Afghanistan’s independence, others lamented that the fight against the Taliban, now in its 16th year, meant there was little to celebrate. “What independence day are we talking about when we are still at war with terrorism and don’t seem to be winning against it?” one user wrote on the social media site.

Afghan singer Sayeed, who has been likened to Kim Kardashian for her skin-tight clothing and selfies posted on her Instagram page, has said she will hold a gig despite threats from conservatives who oppose women performing in public. “The concert will one hundred percent be held on Saturday evening,” she told Tolo News late yesterday.

Nigeria says ailing President Muhammadu Buhari to return today after 3 months,"FILE – In this May 29, 2015 file photo, Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari salutes his supporters during his inauguration in Abuja, Nigeria.

(AP Photo/Sunday Alamba, File)

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari will return to the country Saturday after more than three months in London for medical treatment, his office announced, while giving no details on what exactly has been ailing him. Buhari will address the nation in a broadcast Monday morning, the statement from the office of the presidency said.

The government of Africa’s most populous nation has never said what kind of medical treatment the 74-year-old leader has been receiving. He also spent seven weeks in London for treatment earlier this this year and said he had never been so sick in his life. He also spoke of receiving blood transfusions.

Saturday’s statement merely called it a “health challenge.”

Buhari’s long absences have led some to call for his replacement and for the military to remind its personnel to remain loyal. In recent weeks, his office has been releasing photos of officials meeting with the rail-thin but smiling president in the hope of reassuring people back home.

Nigeria’s ongoing challenges include the deadly Boko Haram insurgency, a weak economy and one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with millions malnourished in the northeast. With Buhari away, Nigeria has been led by acting president and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who met with the president in London in mid-July and announced that Buhari would return to Nigeria “very shortly.”

Observers have feared that political unrest could erupt in Nigeria, particularly in the predominantly Muslim north, should Buhari not finish his term in office. The previous president was a Christian from the south, as is Osinbajo.

When former President Musa Yar’Adua was ill abroad for months before coming home to die in 2009, northerners blocked his southern Vice President Goodluck Jonathan from assuming power, creating a months-long political paralysis.

Jonathan was eventually confirmed, but his subsequent successful run for election angered many Muslims, breaking an unwritten agreement that power rotate between northerners and southerners. Buhari’s four-year term ends in 2019.

Soul Strings: U Rajesh on the legacy of playing an Italian lute in the Carnatic classical system,"In the last three years, U Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound. In the last three years, U Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound.

Growing up in Palakal, Andhra Pradesh, U Rajesh never saw his older brother engage in sibling rivalry. “Or revelry,” says Rajesh, “He was nine years older, would hardly talk or play and was always bent on a small fretboard, trying to figure something rest of us didn’t know. But I was a restive child, always wanting to go out to play, but he would never bother.”

In a telephone conversation from Chennai, Rajesh is referring to U Srinivas, better known to the world as Mandolin Srinivas, the famed musician who convinced the purists of the Carnatic classical world that an Italian lute, associated with court recitals in Europe, baroque concerti by Vivaldi and film music in India, could present the complexities of Carnatic music. Srinivas modified the instrument, using five single strings instead of the traditional four doubled strings and, in the process, the mandolin created gamakas, delivered nuances and gave pleasure to the rasikas as any other Indian classical instrument. Violin took decades to find that status in India. While the uninitiated enjoyed the novelty his music displayed, the connoisseurs loved the deft strokes, the technique, and the passion. So much so that when George Harrison stumbled upon Mandolin Ecstacy in the ’80s, a Srinivas album, he said in an interview, “Eddie van Halen, eat your heart out”. Halen is one of the most distinguished guitarists in the history of rock music. Srinivas wasn’t in his twenties yet. His Carnatic career with the mandolin had just begun.

But Srinivas passed away in 2014 after a liver transplant failure. He was only 45, with a Padma Shri, a Sangeet Natak Akademi award and praises from Harrison and John Mclaughlin under his belt.

But, during the time he was alive, he taught Rajesh his unique style on the advice of Paramacharya of Kanchipuram. “I learnt some krithis. I always wanted to be a pilot. My brother said he’d help in that but, if I chose music, there would be no endorsements. ‘My job will be to only teach you. No more,’ he said. I was to take my pick,” recalls Rajesh, who did choose music, thinking he could go to his brother if there was a challenging situation. The two also played many duets. “And then, in a matter of just a month, he was gone. While performing, I still look to my right sometimes to get approval,” says 38-year-old Rajesh, who will be in Delhi on August 23 for a performance with sitar player Purbayan Chatterjee as a part of the 19th Amar Jyoti Concert presented by Pt Chaturlal Memorial Society. The organisation was formed in the memory of Pt Chaturlal, a fixture in Pt Ravi Shankar’s concerts abroad in the ’50s and one of the first Indian tabla players to introduce Indian percussion system to the West. Chaturlal died in 1965, at the age of 40. Ut Allah Rakha took over after that. The performance will be followed by a flute recital by Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia.

In the last three years, Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound. His collaboration with Chatterjee is also an endeavour in that direction. Apart from releasing Timeless, the last live recording of the kutcheri in Mylapore where he played with his brother, and performances at Chennai’s December season, he is actively collaborating “to see how classical mandolin interacts with other Western instruments”. He’s already worked with Mclaughlin on Floating Point, which was nominated for a Grammy in 2009.

He will soon head to the US for his work with LA Philharmonic Orchestra. “This exchange of notes widens my perspective of my own music. I’m trying to be my own musician, entangle myself with challenges, find answers myself,” says Rajesh.

Pro Kabaddi 2017 moves to ‘city of nawabs’ Lucknow,"U.P. Yoddha’s players pin down Telugu Titan’s player. (Source: AP) U.P. Yoddha’s players pin down Telugu Titan’s player. (Source: AP)

After Gujarat Fortunegiants’ incredible rampant run in Ahmedabad, the action now shifts to Lucknow as UP Yoddha look to capitalise on home advantage in the fourth leg of Pro Kabaddi season 5. The third leg culminated with Fortunegiants sharing three points with Bengal Warriors to strengthen their hold at the top spot in Zone A. It will be interesting to see if UP Yoddha manage to put up a fight or will they succumb in front of the home crowd.

Other than Gujarat, UP Yoddha, Patna Pirates and Puneri Paltan have shown signs of consistency so far in the tournament while Telugu Titans and Bengaluru Bulls’ horrific season continues. Despite having star players like Rahul Chaudhari, Rakesh Kumar, Rohit Kumar, the two giants of Pro Kabaddi have struggled.

Meanwhile, the focus will be on the Nitin Tomar-led side as they take on much-experienced side U Mumba in their first home game. As it has been the case so far, the UP-based team has relied on their captain as Rishank Devadiga hasn’t delivered much in their last four matches. In the four matches he has played, he has scored 20 points. UP Yoddha began their debut season with a comprehensive win over the Titans, Bengaluru Bulls before going down against Bengal Warriors. But, they bounced back against Titans and showed great composure against the Pirates.

Currently, sitting at the third spot in the Zone B points table, the hosts look like they have an advantage as compared to that of U Mumba. With their captain looking in fine touch, Yoddha will hope to start their home campaign on a winning note as Anup’s form has not been as per his standards.

As the first inter-zonal week continues, UP Yoddha will play three of their six home games against Zone A teams. After facing U Mumba, Nitin & co will play Haryana Steelers and Jaipur Pink Panthers. In the other inter-zonal contests, Bengaluru Bulls will take on Jaipur Pink Panthers, Telugu Titans will face season 2 winners and the defending champions clash against Puneri Paltan.

However, the challenge will be for Gujarat Fortunegiants and their youngsters, – Sachin Tawar, Rohit Gulia and Mahendra Rajput, – to display their prodigy in away matches.

The match between UP Yoddha and Jaipur Pink Panthers will conclude the first leg of the inter-zonal challenge as the competition will once again shift to intra-zonal matches. This is also the first time that Lucknow fans will see their star players take panga at the Babu Banarasi Das indoor stadium.

Divij Sharan and Purav Raja split to keep US Open hopes alive,"Divij Sharan and Purav Raja, have decided to split to give themselves a chance to qualify for the US Open. (twitter.com) Divij Sharan and Purav Raja, have decided to split to give themselves a chance to qualify for the US Open. (twitter.com)

India’s most stable doubles pairing, Divij Sharan and Purav Raja, have decided to split to give themselves a chance to qualify for the US Open. Raja will now team up with veteran Leander Paes for the upcoming tournaments, while Sharan will partner Andre Begemann of Germany. “We (Sharan and Raja) weren’t sure if we would make the cut at Winston-Salem Open (ATP 250) and US Open, so we decided to look for higher ranked partners for these two tournaments” says Sharan.

The duo was the only Indian pairing placed in the top-100 but suffered a sudden drop in rankings after failing to defend the points they had won last year. At the recently concluded event in Los Cabos, Mexico, Sharan and Raja were defending 250 points as they had won the tournament in 2016 but could only reach the semi-finals this time, dropping 160 ranking points.

Subsequently, their ranking dropped by 15 places, Sharan falling to 68 and Raja to 69. With their sights set on the last Grand Slam of the year, there was a possibility that their new rankings would not grant them a spot at the US Open. “After Los Cabos, I realised that we might not make the cut,” says Raja. “So I asked him (Leander) what his plans are and he was keen to play a few weeks together.”

Since teaming up in 2016, the Raja-Sharan partnership was successful, capturing the title at Los Cabos and winning a further four Challenger events in the previous season. This year, they started off as finalists at the Chennai Open, and later went on to win Bordeaux Challenger. At the Slams, they were knocked out in the first round of the Australian Open, second round at Wimbledon, but managed a third-round finish on clay at Roland Garros. They also reached their highest career ranks (Sharan 51 and Raja 52) together.

The doubles cut-off for the US Open is usually in the range of 130 to 135 combined ranks, but Raja expects the number to be lower for this edition, making it clear that the split was more of a precautionary move.

Raja and the higher ranked Paes’ (59) combined rank comes to 128, while Sharan’s partner Begemann is placed just two spots ahead of him at 66 – making their combined rank 134. The last time Raja and Paes teamed up was in 2013, in the first round zonal Davis Cup tie against South Korea. Both are proficient net-players, but have limitations in their serve and baseline games. Interestingly enough, Paes too is struggling with form and was dropped from the Davis Cup for a second consecutive tie just last week.

Vitamin C jabs may stave off blood cancer: Study,"To determine the effect of mutations that reduce TET2 function in abnormal stem cells, the team genetically engineered mice such that the scientists could switch the TET2 gene on or off.

Vitamin C injections may halt the progression of blood cancer by encouraging faulty stem cells in the bone marrow to die, a study in mice has found. Certain genetic changes are known to reduce the ability of an enzyme called TET2 to encourage stem cells to become mature blood cells, which eventually die, in many patients with certain kinds of leukemia, researchers said. “We are excited by the prospect that high-dose vitamin C might become a safe treatment for blood diseases caused by TET2-deficient leukemia stem cells, most likely in combination with other targeted therapies,” said Benjamin Neel, professor at New York University (NYU) in the US.

Changes in the genetic code (mutations) that reduce TET2 function are found in 10 per cent of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 30 per cent of those with a form of pre-leukemia called myelodysplastic syndrome, and in nearly 50 per cent of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

Such cancers cause anemia, infection risk, and bleeding as abnormal stem cells multiply in the bone marrow until they interfere with blood cell production, with the number of cases increasing as the population ages. Researchers studied the relationship between TET2 and cytosine, one of the four nucleic acid “letters” that comprise the DNA code in genes.

To determine the effect of mutations that reduce TET2 function in abnormal stem cells, the team genetically engineered mice such that the scientists could switch the TET2 gene on or off. They found that similar to the naturally occurring effects of TET2 mutations in mice or humans, using molecular biology techniques to turn off TET2 in mice caused abnormal stem cell behaviour. These changes were reversed when TET2 expression was restored by a genetic trick.

Previous studies had shown that vitamin C could stimulate the activity of TET2 and its relatives TET1 and TET3.

Since only one of the two copies of the TET2 gene in each stem cell is usually affected in TET2-mutant blood diseases, researchers hypothesised that high doses of vitamin C, which can only be given intravenously, might reverse the effects of TET2 deficiency by turning up the action of the remaining functional gene.

They found that vitamin C did the same thing as restoring TET2 function genetically. By promoting DNA demethylation, high-dose vitamin C treatment induced stem cells to mature, and also suppressed the growth of leukemia cancer stem cells from human patients implanted in mice. “Interestingly, we also found that vitamin C treatment had an effect on leukemic stem cells that resembled damage to their DNA,” said Luisa Cimmino, assistant professor at NYU Langone Health.

Researchers combined vitamin C with a PARP inhibitor, a drug type known to cause cancer cell death by blocking the repair of DNA damage. They found that the combination had an enhanced effect on leukemia stem cells, further shifting them from self-renewal back toward maturity and cell death.

The results also suggest that vitamin C might drive leukemic stem cells without TET2 mutations toward death, given that it turns up any TET2 activity normally in place, Cimmino said. The study was published in the journal Cell.

"Venezuela’s sacked attorney general is in Colombia, authorities say","Venezuela’s ousted chief prosecutor fled to Colombia with her husband German Ferrer, on Friday a day after the Supreme Court ordered his arrest. (Source: AP Photo/File) Venezuela’s ousted chief prosecutor fled to Colombia with her husband German Ferrer, on Friday a day after the Supreme Court ordered his arrest. (Source: AP Photo/File)

Venezuela’s former top prosecutor Luisa Ortega arrived in Colombia on Friday, migration authorities in Bogota said, after she was fired by a controversial new legislative superbody and said she feared for her life. Ortega broke with socialist President Nicolas Maduro in late March and became a vocal critic of his unpopular government, eventually going into hiding after the newly elected constituent assembly fired her earlier this month.

The assembly fired Ortega during its first session on August 5, but she and some governments in the region have refused to accept the body’s decisions. “This afternoon the attorney general of Venezuela Luisa Ortega Diaz arrived from Aruba in a private plane to Bogota’s airport and completed the corresponding migration process,” Colombia’s migration agency said in a statement.

She was accompanied by her husband, the legislator German Ferrer, the statement added. It was not clear whether the couple were seeking asylum in Colombia. The 59-year-old told Reuters in an interview this month that she feared the government would “deprive me of my life.” Her replacement, ex-human rights ombudsman Tarek Saab, this week outlined corruption accusations against Ortega and her husband.

The couple are accused of running an “extortion gang” and funneling profits into an account in the Bahamas. More than 120 people have been killed during often violent unrest against Maduro’s government over a crippling economic crisis and what opponents call his increasingly authoritarian rule.

Colombia is among the Latin American countries which have roundly criticized Maduro, while also condemning a suggestion by US President Donald Trump that a military intervention was an option to solve the crisis. South American trade bloc Mercosur said on Friday they will not recognize any measures taken by the constituent assembly. Ortega’s chief of staff did not respond to a request for comment.

"Iran parliament clears oil, foreign ministers for Rouhani’s new cabinet","Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani (Source: AP) Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani (Source: AP)

The Iranian parliament voted on Sunday to keep the oil and foreign ministers, two of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani’s key members of cabinet, in their posts. Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh has been credited with the boost in Iran’s crude output since many global sanctions were lifted last year and with a multi-billion-dollar deal with France’s Total to develop South Pars, the world’s largest gas field.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was Iran’s lead negotiator in the landmark 2015 agreement in which Western powers agreed to rescind sanctions on the Islamic Republic in exchange for curbs on its disputed nuclear programme. “The most important duty of our foreign minister is to stand by the nuclear agreement and not allow America to succeed, not allow Iran’s enemies to succeed,” Rouhani said in an address to parliament before the vote, broadcast live on state TV.

“The person who defends the nuclear agreement is standing against the enemies of Iran, in other words standing against America, Israel and some small enemies in the region who are creating trouble.” Fourteen other ministerial candidates also received parliamentary approval on Sunday and only one of Rouhani’s nominees, the candidate for the ministry of energy, did not gather enough votes.

Rouhani was criticised by reformists two weeks ago when he submitted the all-male list of cabinet ministers to parliament. He had mentioned the importance of women’s rights in campaign speeches before May’s presidential election in which he won a second term. Rouhani appointed two female vice-presidents one day after submitting the list of candidates but the appointments did not defuse the criticism.

Vice-presidents do not have ministerial responsibility and do not need parliamentary approval. The approval of most of the ministerial candidates was a boost for Rouhani but he still faces hardline conservative opposition to his outreach to the West through the nuclear deal and his push for an easing of social restrictions at home.

In his address, Rouhani – who lacks control over security and judicial organs that answer only to hardline Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – acknowledged the obstacles his administration faces in his second term. “We don’t have a smooth and easy road ahead. In the current situation, governance in the world, including Europe, America, Asia and other continents, is not easy and smooth, much less in Iran and in this chaotic (Middle East) region which has left us with many problems.”

Twenty-eight National Disaster Response Force teams comprising 1,152 personnel with 118 boats are involved in rescue and relief operations, an official release said. Besides, 16 teams of the State Disaster Response Force comprising 466 personnel are helping people in the flood-hit areas with 92 boats, it said, adding 630 Army personnel are also assisting in relief and rescue operations with 70 boats.

Millions of Americans to gaze upon Monday’s once-in-a-lifetime solar eclipse,"In this photo taken Friday, Aug. 18, 2017, fourth graders at Clardy Elementary School in Kansas City, Mo. practice the proper use of their eclipse glasses in anticipation of Monday’s solar eclipse.

Twilight will fall at midday on Monday, stars will glimmer and birds will roost in an eerie stillness as millions of Americans and visitors witness the first total solar eclipse to traverse the United States from coast to coast in 99 years. The sight of the moon’s shadow passing directly in front of the sun, blotting out all but the halo-like solar corona, may draw the largest live audience for a celestial event in human history. When those watching via broadcast and online media are factored into the mix, the spectacle will likely smash records. “It will certainly be the most observed total eclipse in history,” astronomer Rick Fienberg of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) said last week.

The eclipse begins its cross-country trajectory over the Pacific Coast of Oregon in late morning. It will reach South Carolina’s Atlantic shore some 90 minutes later. The total eclipse of the sun is considered one of the most spell-binding phenomena in nature but it rarely occurs over a wide swath of land, let alone one of the world’s most heavily populated countries at the height of summer. In terms of audience potential, it is hard to top the United States, with its mobile and affluent population, even though the direct path is mostly over rural areas, towns and small cities. The largest is Nashville, Tennessee, a city of 660,000 residents.

Even so the advent of social media and inexpensive high-tech optics have boosted public awareness, assuring what many U.S. experts predict will be unprecedented viewership for the so-called “Great American Eclipse.” Some might take issue with that prediction, citing a solar eclipse visible over parts of India, Nepal, Bangladesh and central China in July 2009. National Geographic estimated 30 million people in Shanghai and Hangzhou alone were in its path that day.

On Monday, the deepest part of the shadow, or umbra, cast by the moon will fall over a 70-mile-wide (113-km-wide), 2,500-mile-long (4,000-km-long) “path of totality” traversing 14 states. The 12 million people who live there can view the eclipse at its fullest merely by walking outside and looking up, weather permitting. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2fNQHFb)

LIVESTREAMING AND PRICE-GOUGING

Some 200 million Americans reside within a day’s drive of the totality zone, and as many as 7 million, experts say, are expected to converge on towns and campgrounds along the narrow corridor for the event. Many are attending multiday festivals featuring music, yoga and astronomy lectures. Millions more could potentially watch in real time as the eclipse is captured by video cameras mounted on 50 high-altitude balloons and streamed online in a joint project between NASA and Montana State University. A partial eclipse will appear throughout North America.

Adding further to the excitement is the wide availability of affordable solar-safe sunglasses produced by the millions and selling so fast that suppliers were running out of stock. The owner of one leading manufacturer reported price gouging by second-hand dealers who were buying up large supplies and reselling them over the internet at a huge mark-up.

Not all the hoopla will unfold on dry land. Welsh pop singer Bonnie Tyler is slated to perform her 1983s hit single “Total Eclipse of the Heart” aboard a cruise liner as the vessel sails into the path of totality from Florida on Monday. Back on the ground, forest rangers, police and city managers in the total eclipse zone are bracing for a crush of travelers they fear will cause epic traffic jams and heighten wildfire hazards.

“Imagine 20 Woodstock festivals occurring simultaneously across the nation,” Michael Zeiler, an AAS advisory panel member wrote on his website, GreatAmericanEclipse.com, referring to the famously chaotic 1969 outdoor rock extravaganza in upstate New York. Hundreds of residents in a prime-viewing area in Oregon had to evacuate on Saturday under threat from a wildfire raging in the Deschutes National Forest, according to InciWeb fire-tracking website.

The so-called Milli Fire, which has scorched more than 7,8OO acres (3,162 hectare), is one of seven burning in Oregon, Montana and Idaho, three of the states crossed by the totality path. Zeiler, an avowed “eclipse chaser” who made the 650-mile (1,046-km) drive from his New Mexico home to Wyoming for a choice view, said South Carolina is likely to see the greatest influx as the destination state closest to the entire U.S. Eastern seaboard. Monday’s event will be the first total solar eclipse spanning the entire continental United States since 1918 and the first visible anywhere in the lower 48 states in 38 years. The next one over North America is due in just seven years, in April 2024.

"Alia Bhatt exercise, workout, training and diet plan","Alia Bhatt is very particular when it comes to her workout routine and diet plan. (Source: Instagram/aliabhatt) Alia Bhatt is very particular when it comes to her workout routine and diet plan. (Source: Instagram/aliabhatt)

If you’re looking for celeb fitness inspiration then Alia Bhatt’s workout routine might make you want to hit the gym. She is no slouch when it comes to her performances on-screen and definitely not one when it comes to staying fit. The Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya actor has worked really hard to get the toned body she has today with the help of celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala. According to reports, she weighed around 67kg when she was 17 and lost around 16kg in just three months when she was shortlisted for her debut film Student of the Year.

Today, all of 24, the actress can often be seen sharing inspirational workout videos with her followers on Instagram, documenting her journey in a way. From working out on the Pilates machine Cadillac to the extremely difficult back-bend bridge, handstand, crunches and Jack Rabbit, she does it all. This beauty doesn’t like repeating workouts, so Karachiwala has her hitting different machines like the corealign, reformer, Wunda chair, step barrel and the Bodhi suspension system.

As far as her diet is concerned, she has a major sweet tooth and is a fan of Pooja Dhingra’s Le 15 Patisserie and Chef Kelvin Cheung’s delectable cakes, but she is also a stickler for discipline and probably that’s what helps her the most.

Bhatt also believes in eating everything in moderation. Recently, she teamed up with celebrity dietician Rujuta Diwekar for a Facebook live session, in which she talked about her body secrets. Shattering the concept of following the online food trends, she said, “Everyone’s talking about gluten-free pizza, brown bread, and red rice, about reducing their carb intake, and I’m eating white bread and butter at 4am. Rujuta showed me how local food eaten in moderation can be healthy.”

In the past, she has even shared photos of her enjoying bread on Instagram, which is a no-no for fitness freaks. “Who knew a piece of malt bread with avocado, tomatoes and a poached egg would make me so happy?,” she wrote.

Britain received a record number of foreign visitors in the second quarter of 2017, and the number of Britons making trips abroad reached an all-time high for the time of year, official figures showed on Friday. Some 10.75 million foreigners visited Britain for tourism or other purposes between April and June, 8 percent more than during 2016 and the most for any calendar quarter since records began in 1980, the Office for National Statistics said.

Britons made 19.09 million overseas trips during the same period, 1 percent more than in 2016 and an all-time high for the time of year, though less than in the peak July-September period which covers schools’ summer holidays. Sterling’s fall against the US dollar and the euro since June 2016’s vote to leave the European Union has made Britain a cheaper place for foreign visitors. There was a 20 percent increase in tourism – which accounts for just under half of visits – while business trips fell by 4 percent and those to see family and friends were little changed. An ONS statistician said there was no evidence in the data that militant attacks in London and Manchester earlier in the year had deterred visitors.

Visits from North America were 29 percent higher than in 2016 at 1.47 million, though the number of visitors from Europe was up a much more modest 3 percent at 7.73 million. Howard Archer, an economist for consultants EY ITEM Club, said North American visits had been “clearly buoyed” by the pound’s weakness against the dollar. British tourism promotion agency VisitBritain said it had revised up its forecasts for visitor numbers this year, and that flight bookings pointed to a 9 percent rise in visitors for the July-September period.

“This continued growth demonstrates the industry’s increasing importance as a key driver of economic growth,” VisitBritain’s director, Patricia Yates, said. Overall, visitors to Britain spent 6.23 billion pounds ($8.03 billion) in the three months to June, 8 percent more than in 2016, while Britons’ spending abroad increased by 2 percent to 11.25 billion pounds. Britons made fewer trips to North America and western Europe, while visits to eastern Europe and other parts of the world rose. ($1 = 0.7762 pounds)

China issues special postal stamp for 9th BRICS summit,"Chinese President Xi Jinping (C) takes a group photo with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (2nd L), Brazil’s President Michel Temer (L), Russian President Vladimir Putin (2nd R) and South Africa’s President Jacob Zuma at the West Lake State Guest House ahead of G20 Summit in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China, September 4, 2016. (Reuters) Chinese President Xi Jinping (C) takes a group photo with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (2nd L), Brazil’s President Michel Temer (L), Russian President Vladimir Putin (2nd R) and South Africa’s President Jacob Zuma at the West Lake State Guest House ahead of G20 Summit in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China, September 4, 2016. (Reuters)

China today issued a special postal stamp to commemorate the ninth annual BRICS summit scheduled to be held early next month in the coastal city of Xiamen in the country’s southeastern Fujian province. The stamp issued by the state-owned China Post bears a logo of the summit as well as the letters “BRICS” and “2017 China”.

It also shows the scenic Gulangyu island, which was included into the UNESCO list last month, as well as the other iconic sites of Xiamen like Xiamen University. “It shows the features of Xiamen,” Zhang Zhijun, who is associated with the Xiamen branch of China Post, was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency.

“With the sea we would like to imply that the summit is a new starting point for the countries to sail into a bright future,” he said. The summit will be held from September 3 to 5. It is the second BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) summit to be held in China. The previous one was held in Sanya, Hainan province, in 2011.

The summit is being held in the backdrop of border tensions between India and China over the standoff at the Doklam area in the Sikkim section which has now entered the third month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, besides leaders of Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa is expected to take part in the summit.

Philatelists can buy eight-stamp sheets or individual stamps. The small sheet is made of silk, with a panorama picture of Gulangyu island by a local photographer Zhu Qingfu. The price of one stamp is 1.2 yuan (about 18 cents).

China previously has also issued stamps for the G20 Hangzhou Summit and the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. The BRICS forum, an independent international organisation encouraging commercial, political and cultural cooperation between the five-member nations, was formed in 2011.

ICC allows concussion substitutes for upcoming Sheffield Shield tournament,"Presently, the rules allow the fit player to only field and not bat or bowl. (Source: AP) Presently, the rules allow the fit player to only field and not bat or bowl. (Source: AP)

The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday has agreed to allow concussion substitutes in the upcoming season of Sheffield Shield tournament. This would allow the injured player to be substituted by a fit player who can also bat or bowl.

Presently, the rules allow the fit player to only field and not bat or bowl. Cricket Australia had been calling for it for the past couple of years. Batsman Phil Hughes in 2014 died after being struck on the head during a Sheffield Shield game.

“Cricket Australia has been a strong advocate for concussion substitutes and we have successfully introduced this into our other competitions,” a CA spokesperson was quoted as saying by The Daily Telegraph. “We look forward to formalising the introduction of this rule into the Sheffield Shield ahead of this season,” he added.

Earlier, David Warner was struck on the neck by a bouncer bowled by teammate Josh Hazelwood during an intra-squad practice match on Tuesday.

Fellow teammate Pat Cummins spoke about the incident to reporters and said,”It’s good that Davey’s fine,” and added, He’s a little bit stiff and sore, but just speaking to him then, he’s all fine. It’s only a practice match so he might or might not be out there tomorrow but he seems to be in pretty good shape.”

"Provide free treatment to 3-yr-old boy, pay Rs 1 lakh to victim’s family, HC tells Haryana govt","The HC also directed the authorities to provide free treatment to the child. The HC also directed the authorities to provide free treatment to the child.

With the Haryana government yet to implement its gender-neutral compensation policy for acid attack victims, the Punjab and Haryana High Court Saturday come to the rescue of a three-year-old boy and asked the Gurgaon Deputy Commissioner and Legal Services Authority to pay Rs 1 lakh each as compensation to the victim’s family. The HC also directed the authorities to provide free treatment to the child.

“It is needless to mention that Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar has been very sympathetic and approved the scheme to include the benefit to male children upto 18 years of age but the matter is still hanging for want of approval from the Planning and Finance Department. I do not know how long it would take to get approval from the Planning and Finance Department but the fact remains that the child needs immediate treatment,” said Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain. The victim’s father had moved HC for amendment in the Relief and Rehabilitation of Women Acid Victims policy and sought inclusion of male child in the definition of “acid victim” under the scheme. He had also prayed for compensation and proper treatment in his plea.

The victim, son of a labourer residing in Gurgoan, was kidnapped last year in December and a day later, was discovered in a dustbin with burn injuries caused by acid. During the treatment, he had been denied compensation saying the policy was only for women and not male children. “The inclusion of the benefit to male child upto 18 years of age under the said scheme has been approved by the Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and now, was waiting for the Planning and Finance Department’s approval. As and when the approval is received, necessary actions will be initiated,” said Haryana government counsels to the High Court.

Notwithstanding the approval, the High Court has directed the Haryana government to apply the scheme in cases of the male children. meanwhile, the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in a different case last month, had asked both states to suitably amend the policies of compensation to include victims of both male and female genders.

"A tribal woman fights for her people’s right to amenities like water, electricity","A still (above) from the film on the problems faced by tribals in Bhaktachi Wadi, a small village near Karjat in Raigad district. (Express Photo) A still (above) from the film on the problems faced by tribals in Bhaktachi Wadi, a small village near Karjat in Raigad district. (Express Photo)

On the suggestion of one of his friends nearly two months ago, Mumbai-based street photographer Pramod Pednekar visited Bhaktachi Wadi, a small village near Karjat in Raigad district. Pednekar’s friend wanted him to witness the efforts of a tribal woman, Indu Kevari, to address the scarcity of water in Bhaktachi Wadi. After reaching the village, Pednekar discovered that Kevari did not confine her efforts to her village, but also reached out to help the tribals of the nearby villages. Impressed, Pednekar decided to document Kevari’s story in a short film.

He returned to the village the very next month to shoot the film, Khadkavarchi Hirval, which will be showcased at the 12th Tribal Film Festival to be held on August 20 at the National Film Archive of India from 2.30 pm to 5.30 pm. While Pednekar has done the production and the cinematography of the film, it is directed by Vilas Sarmalkar.

“The village had been facing water problem for the last many years. But nothing was done to address it. Kevari consistently and relentlessly followed up with the local civic officials to resolve the water issue by doing the rounds of the government offices. Simultaneously, she gathered the village women to support her fight for the issue. Recently, Bhaktachi Wadi saw 500-metre water pipeline being laid which has solved its water problem,” says Pednekar.

Pednekar shares that two years ago, through a local social worker, Kevari, who’s in her early 30s, got in touch with a social organisation, CORO India, that works for the rights of the marginalised communities. After interacting with the NGO workers, she got the confidence to fight for the rights of her community. In the 14-minute film, she talks about the various problems faced by the tribals in her area, particularly the village Tepachi Wadi.

“The need for livelihood makes tribal people migrate from one place to another and, hence, the children of the community remain uneducated. They do not have ration cards and have various health problems due to lack of nutrition, consumption of polluted water and continuously working in the brick kilns. There are various government policies for them, but the benefits fail to reach them,” she says.

“She (Kevari) herself has two kids, but instead of living only for her family and her kids, she is walking an extra mile to help others. Given that the film is a strong medium to spread any message, I decided to capture the problem of the tribals of this region as well as Kevari’s struggle to fight for their problems, like electricity, water, education, etc,” says Pednekar, adding that the villagers of both Bhaktachi Wadi and Tepachi Wadi cooperated during the shoot of the film.

Jointly organised by Bahurang Pune and Global Enviro-Legal Services Foundation, the Tribal Film Festival will also see screening of other films that talk about the tribal communities. Some of the films include We Have To Reach Them, The Garos, Baster Rhythm of Progress; Tribal of Andaman, Vanishing and Tribe and Pavara: Ek Jamaat.

The duo had shot dead Dabholkar on August 20, 2013, around 7.25 am on the V R Shinde bridge in the city. For three years, there was no clue about the murder. On June 10, 2016, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Sanatan Sanstha seeker Virendra Tawde.

Along with Tawde, CBI named Vinay Pawar, who has been missing since 2009, and Sarang Akolkar, who is absconding in the October 2009 Goa blast case, as prime suspects. CBI claimed that Akolkar and Pawar are the two persons who opened fire on Dabholkar, causing his death.

In March this year, the CBI’s special crime branch announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh for the person giving information about Akolkar and Pawar. In the chargesheet filed against Tawde on September 8, 2016, the CBI mentioned the motive behind the murder as “long-standing enmity/hatred” between Dabholkar and his organisation, Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS), with Sanatan Sanstha.

In the chargesheet, the CBI gave the details of the alleged email conversation between Tawde and Akolkar, against whom a red corner notice was issued by Interpol in July 2012. “One email, dated April 20, 2009, from Akolkar to Tawde mentions about the availability of country-made arms (deshi banavatiche sahitya) in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It also mentioned about foreign made arms (pardeshi sahitya) availability in Assam. Here coded language has been used. It is also mentioned in email about the raising of the army of 15,000 persons for financial procurement of firearms (sahitya), even theft could be committed, in case of need,” the chargesheet stated.

A statement by a Hindutva activist, Sanjay Sadvilkar from Kolhapur, helped the CBI in the investigation. CBI claims that even after Akolkar went absconding, Tawde’s association with him continued. The CBI mentions that Tawde and Akolkar had a meeting with Sadvilkar in 2013. Tawde wanted to manufacture weapons with Sadvilkar’s help. “Akolkar had for this purpose brought samples of one country-made pistol and one country-made revolver of high quality,” it is stated. Sanatan Sanstha calls Sadvilkar a “bogus” witness.

Meanwhile, in August 2016, the special investigation team (SIT) of Kolhapur police took Tawde’s custody to probe his involvement in the murder of Communist leader Govind Pansare. Two persons had opened fire at Pansare and his wife, Uma, while they were returning home from morning walk on February 16, 2015. Pansare had died while undergoing treatment at the hospital on February 20. Uma received bullet injury, but survived. SIT filed a supplementary chargesheet against Tawde on November 29, 2016, naming him as the prime conspirator and Akolkar, Vinay Pawar and Rudra Patil as wanted accused in the case. Earlier this month, the state government too announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for the information about Akolkar and Pawar.

The ballistic reports

The Pune City police had arrested illegal firearms dealer Manish Nagori (24) and Vilas Khandelwal (22), on June 20, 2014, in Dabholkar murder case. This arrest was on the basis of a ballistic report of firearms seized from the duo when they were arrested by Mumbra police in an extortion case on August 20, 2013, the day when Dabholkar was murdered in Pune. The report suggested that one of the firearms (seized from Khandelwal) matched with the “markings” on a cartridge seized from crime scene.

CBI sent the samples of bullets and cartridges found at the crime scenes — Pune (Dabholkar murder), Kolhapur (Pansare murder) and Dharwad in Karnataka where Kannada scholar M M Kalburgi was shot dead on August 30, 2015 — to the New Scotland Yard police.

Earlier, the CBI got conflicting reports by the Mumbai Forensic Science Laboratory and the Bengaluru Forensic Science Lab (FSL) regarding the seized bullets and cartridges due to which the agency wanted an opinion from the foreign agency. But, in January this year, the CBI told the High Court that the Scotland Yard police could not give its opinion as there was no written agreement between India and the UK about sharing such information. The CBI then sought a forensic report from the Department of Forensic Sciences in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and submitted it to the High Court, where it is under investigation.

"Little details key to beating Newcastle United, says Huddersfield Town’s David Wagner","Huddersfield’s dream run continued with their Premier League debut with a 3-0 win over Crystal Palace. (Source: Reuters) Huddersfield’s dream run continued with their Premier League debut with a 3-0 win over Crystal Palace. (Source: Reuters)

Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner has urged his side to focus on getting every aspect of their game plan right against Newcastle United on Sunday as the two promoted clubs face each other in the Premier League for the first time.

Newcastle finished top of the Championship last season to get into the league, while Huddersfield earned promotion by winning the play-offs in May.

Huddersfield’s dream run continued with their Premier League debut with a 3-0 win over Crystal Palace last Saturday and Wagner is hopeful of getting a win when his team host Newcastle in their first home league game.

“I am very excited about Sunday’s game. I’m sure it will be an extraordinary atmosphere against Newcastle,” Wagner told reporters on Friday.

“We will have to get the little details right against Newcastle. We have to be totally focused. It’s important for us to get points on the board and to put in a good performance.”

Forward Nahki Wells is ruled out for another five to seven weeks as he recovers an ankle injury, and midfielder Jonathan Hogg could return from his ankle injury after the upcoming international break, Wagner said.

The German boss confirmed that Huddersfield would not sign Barnsley right back Andrew Yiadom, saying that the deal “is dead”.

Indian language autonomous bodies will not be diluted on NITI Aayog suggestion: HRD minister Javadekar,"Asked specifically if he wanted to preserve the unique identity of every language, Javadekar said: “Yes.” (PTI/File) Asked specifically if he wanted to preserve the unique identity of every language, Javadekar said: “Yes.” (PTI/File)

The HRD Ministry is not in favour of the NITI Aayog’s suggestion to dilute the character of autonomous bodies set up to promote Indian languages, minister Prakash Javadekar told The Indian Express on Friday. “They (the NITI Aayog) had given us a few suggestions. But we have put our point of view forward. Every language is unique. We want to promote all Indian languages. We want to preserve the unique identity of all (language) councils,” he said.

Asked specifically if he wanted to preserve the unique identity of every language, Javadekar said: “Yes.” The Indian Express had reported on June 14 that the NITI Aayog had suggested a merger of the Central Institute of Classical Tamil (CICT) with the Central Institute of Indian Languages in Mysuru.

Similarly, the National Council for Promotion of Sindhi Language was recommended to be merged with the Central Institute of Indian Languages, and the National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language with either the Maulana Azad National Urdu University or Jamia Millia Islamia.

The above mergers were recommended as part of the review of 114 autonomous bodies under seven ministries or departments, undertaken by the NITI Aayog and the PMO. Of 114 autonomous bodies, 42 were listed for “reduction” by either winding them up entirely, merging them with other entities, reorganising them under a common umbrella, or corporatising them.

The suggestions regarding the CICT has become a larger issue in Tamil Nadu as it was perceived to be an attempt by the Centre to assert its supremacy on Tamil identity.

Indian-origin boy Rahul wins UK Child Genius show with IQ higher than Einstein and Hawking,"In the final, Rahul impressed with knowledge of his chosen subject – Edward Jenner’s medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England. (Source: Channel 4 via twitter) In the final, Rahul impressed with knowledge of his chosen subject – Edward Jenner’s medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England. (Source: Channel 4 via twitter)

A 12-year-old Indian-origin boy, believed to be having an IQ higher than Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, has been crowned as the UK’s ‘Child Genius’ in a popular television quiz competition. Rahul Doshi, who a few days a back became an overnight sensation after answering all questions correctly in some of the earlier rounds, won the Channel 4 show ‘Child Genius’ by beating his nine-year-old opponent Ronan 10-4 in the programme’s finale last night.

The schoolboy from north London clinched the title by answering a question on 19th Century artists William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. “It didn’t sink in straight away, but it was really nice,” Rahul said after winning the title.

In the final, Rahul impressed with knowledge of his chosen subject – Edward Jenner’s medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England. “I was bursting with pride,” said his father Minesh, an IT manager who had entered his son into the competition.

The final followed an intense competition – aired through the week – which saw the candidates showing off their maths, English, spelling and history skills as well as memory powers. Rahul had been one of the favourites throughout, after scoring very highly in previous rounds – and even bagging a full house in the very first round of the series.

Rahul is all of us and our obsession with @richardosman. #ChildGenius pic.twitter.com/f4krdaNeZu — Channel 4 (@Channel4) August 14, 2017

He had captured the imagination of audiences during the competition after he correctly memorised the order of a pack of cards. Rahul, whose ambition is to become a financial adviser, had revealed his strategy for the final as: “The key is to block out everything else and remain calm. So just focus on your goal. Mine was to answer as many questions as I could correctly and that helped me stay calm and do quite well in the early stages.”

Rahul has an IQ of 162, which is believed to be higher than the likes of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, and qualifies him to be a member of Mensa club – the largest and oldest high IQ society in the world. He was cheered on by father Minesh and pharmacist mother Komal during the show. His father attracted some social media fury for laughing at a wrong answer given by his son’s closest rival, Ronan, in a tense finale.

“#ChildGenius an adult laughing at a children getting a question wrong shocking behaviour. Shame on you Rahul’s father,” read one of the comments on Twitter. But Minesh Doshi had been very vocal about his competitive side throughout the competition. He had previously said: “We are here to win. There’s no two ways about that.” Twenty contestants aged eight to 12 were whittled down to one winner over the course of a week as part of the ‘Child Genius’ 2017 series.

"Deepika Padukone’s colour-block shirt isn’t impressive at all, but her denims are way too cool","Deepika Padukone spotted at Mumbai airport. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries) Deepika Padukone spotted at Mumbai airport. (Source: Instagram/afashionistasdiaries)

Looks like simple button-down shirts are a thing of the past now. We were still trying to get our heads around how to pair a deconstructed shirt but with fashion trends changing so often, we were presented with a new dilemma – on how to wear a colour-block shirt. In all fairness, if we would have spotted this dual-tone summer wear while out shopping, we would have never gone for it. But Deepika Padukone being the fashion chameleon she is, decided to add it to her wardrobe. She stepped out at the airport in a half gingham print and half pastel blue shirt and even though we applaud her for her sartorial experiment, it just failed to impress us.

However, she totally aced her denim game in the fanciest and coolest pair ever! The 70s-inspired flared jeans are having a huge moment right now and Padukone took it to the next level with this one – we love how it’s frayed at the ankles.

You can pair it with almost anything, starting from statement tees to tank tops and halter-necks – just make sure that your top isn’t baggy. You can complement your look like the Padmavati actor with a pair of Nike slides, minimum make-up, an updo and a pair of sunglasses.

This particular travel look isn’t our favourite but a couple of days back, she aced her airport style in basics.

The white top (from Purple Paisley) and blue jeans (From Zara) combo is a classic and we love the way she casually shrugged on that denim jacket to add oomph to her too-cool-for-school look. The statement, ankle length boots and a pair of blue aviators made all the difference. It’s something we would definitely like to try the next time we are jet-setting.

Tayyip Erdogan tells Turks in Germany to vote against Angela Merkel,"FILE PHOTO: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel meet at the presidential palace during the first visit since July’s failed coup in Ankara, Turkey, February 2, 2017. (Source: REUTERS/Umit Bektas, file) FILE PHOTO: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel meet at the presidential palace during the first visit since July’s failed coup in Ankara, Turkey, February 2, 2017. (Source: REUTERS/Umit Bektas, file)

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Friday said German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats were enemies of Turkey and called on Turks in Germany to vote against major parties in next month’s elections. The comments are some of Erdogan’s harshest yet against Merkel and her Christian Democrats, illustrating the widening divide between the NATO allies and major trade partners. Ties between Ankara and Berlin have been strained in the aftermath of last year’s failed coup as Turkish authorities have sacked or suspended 150,000 people and detained more than 50,000 people, including German nationals.

Germany has voiced concern that Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. Erdogan, an authoritarian leader whose roots are in political Islam, has accused Germany of anti-Turkish and anti-Muslim sentiment. “I am calling on all my countrymen in Germany: the Christian Democrats, SDP, the Green Party are all enemies of Turkey. Support those political parties who are not enemies of Turkey,” he said in comments after Friday prayers in Istanbul.

“I call on them not to vote for those parties who have been engaged in such aggressive, disrespectful attitudes against Turkey, and I invite them to teach a lesson to those political parties at the ballot box,” he said. Germany has a large Turkish diaspora and it contains a broad range of opinion on Turkish politics. Germans go to the polls on Sept. 24 for elections where Merkel is running for a fourth term. Her conservatives enjoy a comfortable lead over the Social Democrats (SPD), their current coalition partner and major rival.

As a result, Erdogan’s comments are unlikely to sway the election’s outcome. Western governments, particularly Germany, have expressed apprehension at Erdogan’s tightening grip on power. In April, Turks narrowly backed a referendum to change the constitution and grant Erdogan sweeping executive powers. In the run-up to the referendum, German authorities prevented Turkish politicians from speaking to rallies of Turkish citizens in Germany, infuriating Ankara.

Turkey also blocked Berlin lawmakers from visiting their troops stationed in southern Turkey. The troops were later relocated to Jordan. Merkel has also said there would be no expansion of a customs union or deepening in EU-Turkish ties, comments which infuriated Turkey.

Erdogan on Friday said Merkel’s remarks on the customs union showed Germany had become a country that violates the European Union’s acquis, or body of law.

"Manchester United thrash Swansea 4-0, register their second straight win","Romelu Lukaku slotted home in the 80th minute from a pass by Henrikh Mkhitaryan. (Source: Reuters) Romelu Lukaku slotted home in the 80th minute from a pass by Henrikh Mkhitaryan. (Source: Reuters)

Manchester United swept to its second straight 4-0 win to start the Premier League season by thrashing Swansea on Saturday, with Romelu Lukaku, Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial all scoring again for Jose Mourinho’s side.

Center back Eric Bailly gave United the lead on the stroke of halftime with a close-range strike at a corner, and the visitors were comfortable in the second half before running amok in the final 10 minutes.

Lukaku slotted home in the 80th from a pass by Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who then set up Pogba to deftly chip goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski in the 82nd.

Martial, on as a substitute, scored United’s third goal in a devastating five-minute span when he finished a counter-attack with a low shot into the corner.

Eight goals scored and two clean sheets makes for an encouraging start to the season for Mourinho, who has built an imposing and clinical team that looks equipped to challenge for the title.

This wasn’t the fast-paced United that demolished West Ham at Old Trafford on the opening weekend until the final 10 minutes, when Swansea’s defense opened up. The Welsh team, which sold its star player Gylfi Sigurdsson to Everton this week, has beaten United twice in August in the last three years.

The only time Swansea seriously threatened United was in the third minute when Jordan Ayew broke clear thanks to a fortunate ricochet, cut into the area and curled an attempted cross with the outside of his right foot against the crossbar.

Phil Jones also struck the bar in the ninth minute for United with an effort that came off his shoulder from Juan Mata’s inswinging free kick.

Circle Education Offices in Punjab on verge of closure,"THE CIRCLE Education Offices (CEOs) in the state seem to be on the verge of closure as the entire clerical staff is being transferred to District Education Offices (DEOs) and Block Primary Education Offices (BPEOs) on the pretext of staff shortage there. Also the department is of the opinion that there was no need for these circle offices now and all the work, which used to be done here earlier by these offices, was being done at the school and DEOs level now. Even the department officials called these offices just dak (official correspondence) collection centres only.

Three CEOs are there in Jalandhar, Nabha and Faridkot districts since Independence and earlier, when Punjab was undivided, a post of Inspector General of School Education used to be there which was converted to CEO later.

Every Circle Education Office has seven to eight districts under them. These offices used to keep the service records of all the lecturer cadre teachers and their ACRs, too, used to be signed from here. Similarly, the records of Assured Career Progression (ACPs) of the school principals were also kept at these offices.

At the Jalandhar CEO, all the nine clerks have been transferred to the DEO and BPEO.

So, the office is left with CEO Jaspal Singh, a stenographer, a superintendent and four senior superintendents now. Similarly, six clerks of Faridkot and seven of Nabha CEOs were transferred on Thursday on the orders of Director Public Institutions (DPI) secondary office.

“Several works were delegated to these offices, including the work pertaining to the counter sign on the ACRs of principals/ headmasters, work pertaining to the confirmations of the newly appointed teachers and Dak from DEOs used to be collected here but now a large number of powers have been delegated to the school principals and DEOs and it leads to no relevance of these offices now,” said a senior education department official, adding that 19 employees of ministerial staff of these three offices were transferred on Thursday.

Punjab Education Department Ministerial Staff Association took out rallies at the district level in protest on Friday. Pawanjit Singh Sidhu, general secretary of the Punjab Education Department Ministerial Staff Association, said the government cannot close these offices without taking the clerical staff into confidence. The clerks transferred from the circle offices are being overburdened as one clerk has to do the work of at least two BPEOs. “There are hundreds of teachers who come under one BPEO and maintaining each and every record of these teachers is not possible for a single clerk,” he said, adding that even the objectionable words are being used for the clerical staff by senior officials.

They also said that CEOs had been set up on the pattern of Divisional Commissioner offices in Punjab. Like three divisional commissioners, there are three CEOs across the state despite every district having deputy commissioners and DEOs.

If a CEO is not required after a DEO, then a divisional commissioner, too, is not required after a DC, argued the ministerial staff.

Jalandhar CEO Jaspal Singh said they have been getting feedback about the closure of circle offices from senior officials though nothing in writing has come. Repeated attempts to contact Education Minister Aruna Chaudhary failed.

"Netherlands tour will help preparations for Women’s Hockey Asia Cup, says coach Sjoerd Marijne","Rani Rampal said that the trip to Netherlands will be a learning experience. (Source: Twitter) Rani Rampal said that the trip to Netherlands will be a learning experience. (Source: Twitter)

Chief coach of the Indian women’s hockey team Sjoerd Marijne said that the team will benefit from their tour to Netherlands and guidance of the legendary Dutch coach Toon Seipman.

Marijne said, “We will have nine training sessions with Seipman, who is a drag-flick expert. Many drag flickers across the world work with him and I am sure our drag flickers can learn a great deal from him,” said the 43-year-old Dutch coach.

“This is an aspect we need to improve upon and I believe the exposure in Holland will help in our preparations for the Women’s Hockey Asia Cup,” he added. “While we will work on bringing different variations in goal scoring and keeping ball possession, we will pay more attention to basics such as trapping and better passing during this camp.

India captain Rani said that the team would be focussing on playing consistently. “There are quite a few aspects we need to learn from our outing at the World League Semi Final. While we did well against USA in the first two quarters, we could not carry on the momentum into the third and fourth quarters.”

“Similarly, against Argentina too we put up a good fight but it’s important to play consistently through the match and we are working on it,” said Rani. “We need to bring more energy into our attack and I am sure playing against Holland, who are very good with attack, it will be a learning experience.”

The Empire Gazes Back,"Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about. Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about.

In 1978, the Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said published a seminal treatment of how the Western world and its scholarship viewed the Islamic world of the Middle East. His central argument was: knowledge is embedded in equations of power and all Western scholarship on nonwestern societies is tainted by its association with imperialism. Power therefore defined knowledge. The reception of ‘Orientalism’ is not surprising. The 1970s was an era when the west seemed to be rolling back. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan followed in 1979. The Shia revolution in Iran in the same year was as much an ideological and intellectual revolution against the West and the USA as a political revolution against the Shah. The spread of extremism and Islamic fundamentalism elsewhere challenged then, as it does now, deeply engrained notions of what constituted progress in Western eyes. Said’s book Orientalism became a classic, as it remains to this day.

Academic critiques of Said were no less powerful. Substantial parts of the book delved into periods when the Islamic world was not subordinated to the West. So, perceptions of Islam as degenerate and backward did not develop as a consequence of Western conquest but, in fact, had predated it. Said’s argument about power and knowledge was much criticised on this ground. But even at that time, there was the view that the perfect match to study the relationship between imperial power and knowledge was to be found not so much in the middle east but in colonial India.

Applying Edward Said’s thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler’s Gaze is about. Arvind Sharma is a professor of comparative religion in Montreal. This is, in part, an assimilative work drawing on a wide range of studies in the past quarter-century, which have asked questions like those he raises: How did colonial scholarship evolve, and how did the process of studying colonial subjects and themes also transform the colonies in greater or lesser measure? This is a book refreshingly free of jargon — it’s a good point for the serious but general reader to start with to understand how much colonialism and imperialism permeated scholarship, and how very clearly the relationship between knowledge and power was understood by both sets of practitioners.

Sharma describes, as others have before him, how scholarship about India and Indians changed as the East India Company transformed itself from a trading enterprise to a political and then a colonial power. The initial fascination, even admiration, for India and things Indians, acquired through the 19th century gave way, especially after 1857, to deep biases arising from a sense of contempt. He also does well to remind us how intrinsic missionary activity was to the entire imperial project as critiques of Hinduism went hand in hand with efforts at conversion. Racism also permeated colonial scholarship to a greater extent than is generally conceded. I found one particular instance cited by Sharma striking. Annette Beveridge, wife of a British civil servant and scholar, was an accomplished Persian scholar in her own right. Her translation of Gulbadan Begum’s Humayun Namah in the late 19th century is a work of great sensitivity and charm, as a woman of the time sought to understand and contextualise the account of a Mughal princess in the 17th century. But Beveridge was also at the forefront of the agitation in India insisting that Indian judges not be allowed to try English or white people. Beveridge then wrote about the social ideas of Hindus as being “on the outer verge of civilisation” and that she had no hesitation in calling them “uncivilised a people which cares about stone idols, enjoys child marriage and secludes its women, and where at every point the fact of sex is present to the mind.” In brief, how could such people be allowed to try English men and women!

Nevertheless, this is not a book about the inequities of British rule in India (although there is some of that) but rather about how British scholarship was an exercise underwritten by power and at the same time directed at cementing a relationship of subjugation. Illustrating how such scholarship also transformed social realities in India is one of Sharma’s endeavors, as he takes us through themes of caste, race, religion, science, historical sense or lack of it, etc. If parts of this treatment would be familiar to scholars, there is also sufficient that is new and surprising enough to engage the general reader.

Sharma’s central thesis of power underwriting scholarship in colonial India is unexceptional. Nevertheless, his extension of Said’s Orientalism debate to India also raises other questions. Did Orientalism cease in 1947 with the end of political subjugation? Or does this approach continue, since in many ways the relationship between India and the West continues to have elements that are unequal. More problematic are the questions thrown up by Sharma’s suggestions that political domination is the key variable in determining perceptions. This explanation, however appealing, may also have limitations. What was characteristic about British scholarship of India in the colonial period was not just that the British ruled India. It was also the fact that the rulers came from a society and an age that had, since the Enlightenment, radically transformed ideas of knowledge and how it was to be collected, organised and disseminated. This gave to knowledge production in colonial India features not encountered in earlier and other situations of political domination.

The Ruler’s Gaze is a thought provoking and imaginative work that furthers the debate about how profoundly British colonialism affected India and Indians.

Irfan Pathan Trolled For Posting Un-Islamic Photo With Wife,"Irfan Pathan recently uploaded a selfie for the first time with his wife Safa Baig from his official Facebook account. It did prove trouble for Pathan as he was soon ridiculed for not only uploading picture of his wife, in which half of her face is visible, but also for wearing nail polish. The picture, in which Baig is covering her face, drew flak from fans on Facebook. Pathan is being ridiculed for ‘letting her show her arms and part of face.’"
This man’s weird balancing act has everyone ROFL-ing,"The bizarre position of the man balancing himself on the rocks has started a meme-fest online. The bizarre position of the man balancing himself on the rocks has started a meme-fest online.

What suddenly becomes a hit meme in Twitterverse is hard to guess. From scenes of Bollywood films like the recent one from Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Main Hoo Naa‘ to Kids, Adults and Legends jokes, it’s hard to gauge what would bring about next wave of memes. But when you come across an inexplicable picture like this one here, it’s only expected that it would present itself as fodder for our active meme-makers. Doing what they do best, Indian Twitterati is busy photoshopping and captioning the Twitter ‘star’.

The bizarre position of the man balancing himself atop rocks in an attempt to not get wet has grabbed eyeballs all across. From the various theories explaining what could have exactly motivated such a unique and a rather uncomfortable posture, some even went on to explain the puzzling Doklam stand-off between India and China,pinpointing the geopolitical locations! The genius that Tweeple can be.

And as if memes and captioning the photo was not enough, soon it led to a hilarious photoshop contest on the microblogging site. From re-imagining Michelangelo’s ‘The Creation of Adam’, which forms part of the Sistine Chapel’s ceiling to ancient sculptures at Khajuraho — many successfully displayed their knack for classical art (can’t blame them, is there anything cooler that classical art meme).

While we absolutely have no idea of the origin of the picture, or who the man is, it has certainly taken Twitter by storm. Check out some of the funny reactions here.

FBI: Two alleged MS-13 gang members arrested in New Jersey,"Federal officials say two alleged members of the MS-13 gang have been arrested in New Jersey. The FBI announced yesterday that fugitives Jose Manuel Romero-Parada and Willians Ernesto Lovos-Ayala were apprehended in Galloway Township.

Romero-Parada, formerly of Indianapolis, was one of 15 people recently indicted in Ohio for allegedly conspiring to extort and launder money for MS-13, an El-Salvador-based gang consisting chiefly of immigrants or descendants of immigrants from Central America.

Romero-Parada’s also wanted in El Salvador on kidnapping related charges. He’s being held at the federal detention center in Philadelphia pending extradition to Ohio. Lovos-Ayala is wanted for first degree murder for a 2015 Virginia slaying. He’s being held in the Atlantic City Jail pending extradition to Virginia. It wasn’t known if they are represented by lawyers.

Radamel Falcao scores again as Monaco win at Metz in French league,"Radamel Falcao pounced with an opportunist finish in the 79th minute for Monaco. (Source: Reuters) Radamel Falcao pounced with an opportunist finish in the 79th minute for Monaco. (Source: Reuters)

Radamel Falcao underlined his worth to defending champion Monaco with a late goal to beat Metz 1-0 in the French league on Friday.

The striker pounced with an opportunist finish in the 79th minute, latching onto a fine pass from substitute midfielder Rachid Ghezzal and slotting home from close range.

Falcao’s fifth goal of the season helped Monaco to a third straight win and a French record 15th straight in the league surpassing Bordeaux’s 14 from the 2008-09 season. Monaco tops the league.

The buildup had been all about Monaco leaving out Kylian Mbappe, who is pushing for a move to rival Paris Saint-Germain. The 18-year-old forward is rated at upward of 160 million euros ($187 million) and wants to play alongside Neymar at PSG.

Monaco coped without Mbappe last weekend, too, winning at Dijon 4-1 as Falcao netted a superb hat trick. This match opposed last season’s top scorers Monaco netted 107 league goals and the worst defense Metz conceded 72.

But Metz, which lost the corresponding home fixture 7-0 last season, competed well. Soon after Monaco striker Guido Carrillo hit the post with a downward header in the 60th minute, Metz center forward Nolan Roux forced a sprawling save from goalie Danijel Subasic.

Monaco then got on top and Ghezzal a summer signing from Lyon beat his marker and cleverly picked out the run of Falcao, who skipped past goalkeeper Thomas Didillon before tapping in.

PSG, which has won its first two matches, hosts Toulouse on Sunday.

A photo exhibition showcasing the achievements of legendary Indian footballers will be held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here from September 11 to 15.

Indo Europe Sports and Leisure Promotional Council and Sports Authority of India have come together to support the exhibition. Announcing the exhibition today, Olympian footballer S S Hakim, also SAI’s Chief Project Director FIFA World Cup 2017, said the performance of the national team from 1948 to 1962 was praiseworthy.

“India also performed very well in the Olympics and Asian Games from 1948 to 1970. This era can be termed as the Golden era of Indian football,” he said.

“Unfortunately, masses and even sportspersons are neither aware of our achievements nor aware of the names of the legends of Indian football. We need to bring back the same enthusiasm for football among the Indian masses. “To fill this gap we have taken an initiative to pay tribute to the legendary players and to inspire the budding footballers to emulate the legends,” said Hakim.

The exhibition also aimed at encouraging the Indian team to perform well in the U-17 World Cup to be held across six cities from October 6-28.

NFL linebacker Khaseem Greene says dropped gun charge ‘was false’,"Khaseem Greene said he’s working to get back into playing shape and hopes to get a call from a team. (Source: AP) Khaseem Greene said he’s working to get back into playing shape and hopes to get a call from a team. (Source: AP)

A gun charge against NFL linebacker Khaseem Greene has been dropped because the man who said he gave him a weapon admitted he lied, the player’s attorney said.

Greene, who had the charges against him dismissed by a judge on July 17 after a request from prosecutors, said the legal trouble has been “probably the toughest time of my life” and has been “very hard emotionally and mentally.”

“People started looking at me differently and accusing me of being this thug, this monster, and all of it was false,” he said by phone.

Greene’s attorney, Joshua McMahon, provided to NJ.com an audio recording of the other man telling detectives he lied about Greene’s involvement in a shooting outside a nightclub in Elizabeth last December.

The other man’s admission came the day he told detectives Greene, who’s from Elizabeth, was involved, but it wasn’t included in a criminal complaint that alleged Greene was seen on camera handing him a gun, McMahon said.

The man, Jason Sanders, is accused of firing into a crowd and remains jailed on aggravated assault and weapons offenses. He has not entered a plea. He’s represented by a public defender whose office policy is to not comment to the media.

Greene declined to comment on specifics of the case on the advice of his attorney pending a federal civil rights lawsuit he intends to file. His attorney said he has filed a tort claim notice warning of the lawsuit.

The prosecutor’s office said it couldn’t comment on specifics of the case while the case against Sanders is pending. Elizabeth’s mayor and the police department declined to comment.

McMahon said the audio recording proves prosecutors moved forward with charges even though Sanders admitted he lied. “The prosecutor’s office and police department worked in concert to repeatedly perpetrate at least two lies to the judge who they sought the initial arrest warrant from and the grand jurors who returned the indictment,” McMahon told NJ.com.

The Kansas City Chiefs released Greene the day charges against him were reported in May. Greene had signed with the team in January. A Chiefs spokesman had no comment.

Greene said he’s working to get back into playing shape and hopes to get a call from a team but he’s also preparing for the possibility of a career after football.

“I love the game. It saved my life. It helped my family get to another place,” he said. “At the same time, I’ve been doing it for so long. I’m being realistic. The NFL life is very short.”

Greene, who starred at Rutgers University, last played a game in 2014 for the Chicago Bears, who selected him in the fourth round of the 2013 draft. He appeared in 25 games with six starts over two seasons for Chicago. He had 60 1/2 tackles, one interception and one forced fumble to go with seven special-teams stops.

Greene wore No. 52 for the Bears to pay tribute to his friend and former Rutgers teammate Eric LeGrand, who was paralyzed while playing for Rutgers in 2010.

Greene was the Big East Defensive Player of the Year in 2011 and 2012.

Sri Lanka ban sweets in dressing room to keep ‘bellies’ in check,"Lasith Malinga looked out of shape during a training session in Dambulla on Saturday. (Source: AP) Lasith Malinga looked out of shape during a training session in Dambulla on Saturday. (Source: AP)

Sweets have been banned in the Sri Lankan dressing room and a protein-rich diet has been recommended for the players, especially during a tournament. The banning of sugar is a standard practice in dressing rooms around the world, but waistlines have become a touchy topic in Sri Lanka ever since the sports minister derided the side for sporting big bellies after their Champions League debacle. Therefore, the new diktat seems to be part of an image or physique makeover.

The Sri Lankan team cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha said that the dietary change is a decision of the team physio Nirmala and physical trainer Nick Lee. “No idea about the biscuits ban (a local newspaper report). Just like other teams, our physio and trainer are managing the dietary requirements of the team. One of the things, they don’t want are sweets in the dressing room.

At the game they have high-protein foods. That’s the change that has been brought about. But it was done before the Champions Trophy. Whatever the food that is coming into the dressing room, is handled by the physio and the trainer. Myself or Sri Lanka Cricket never gets involved in that. Even the head coach doesn’t get involved in that,” Gurusinha said, speaking to The Sunday Express after the team’s training session at Dambulla International Stadium on Saturday.

Asked how the players have reacted to the revised diet chart, Gurusinha, who was part of Sri Lanka’s 1996 World Cup-winning team, replied: “The players are actually very supportive of what the physio and trainer are doing.”

Overweight players

Fitness, of late, has become an issue in Sri Lankan cricket, especially after their Champions Trophy group phase exit. “Sri Lanka is the only cricket team to have players with big bellies and it’s not surprising there are so many drops. Leave alone the catches, how many runs have leaked in the field,” the sports minister was quoted as saying by the local newspapers.

Malinga had responded by saying: “What does a monkey know about a parrot’s nesting hollow?”

The fast bowler got a suspended one-year ban for his remarks, while the sports minister sent a directive not to include any cricketer in the national team with more than 16 per cent body fat. As per Sri Lanka’s sports law, any team that represents the country needs the sports minister’s approval.

Poor catching cost Sri Lanka a knockout berth in the Champions Trophy as Sarfraz Ahmed had been dropped twice and went on to score a match-winning 61 not out in a must-win game against Pakistan. During their 3-2 loss to Zimbabwe also, Sri Lanka had dropped a few sitters, allowing the tourists to chase down a 300-plus total at Galle.

Gurusinha, however, played down the issue. “I feel we have over-talked it, the fitness side. These guys are pretty fit. When you lose games, they talk about a lot about fitness and everything. I think if you test our guys, our fitness standards, we would be pretty close to the Indian team fitness standards. Some may be much better.”

Captain Upul Tharanga also tried to put things in perspective during his pre-match press conference. “We have been doing the fitness without any change. I started in 2005 and no change has happened, but the problem is the last two years we have had lot of injuries. We are without the three main fast bowlers for this series. We are doing all the fitness and dieting and all that, but you can’t do anything when people break down during series.”

Japan today launched the third satellite in its effort to build a homegrown geolocation system aimed at improving the accuracy of car navigation systems and smartphone maps to mere centimetres.

An H-IIA rocket blasted off at about 2:30 pm (0530 GMT) from the Tanegashima space centre in southern Japan, according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

The rocket successfully released the “Michibiki” No.3 satellite about 30 minutes after launch.

The launch was initially scheduled last week but was postponed due to a technical glitch.

Satellite geolocation systems, initially designed for the US military, now power countless civilian applications, from car navigation to internet browsing on mobile phones.

Japan relies on the US-operated Global Positioning System (GPS). Today’s launch was part of a broader plan to build a domestic version with four satellites focusing on the country and wider region.

The first satellite was put into orbit in 2010 and the second was launched in June.

The fourth is to be launched by March 2018 to start up the service.

The Japan-built system will still need to operate in tandem with GPS.

Though GPS is widely used in Japan, having supplementary satellites is important in a country where mountainous terrain and high buildings may interfere with its signals.

Michibiki, meaning “guidance” in Japanese, will cover the Asia-Oceania region and is intended for civilian use.

Japan plans to boost the number of its satellites in orbit to seven by around 2023.

Saina Nehwal: The Unbreakable,"Saina Nehwal will be an underdog but writing her off will be naive. (Source: File) Saina Nehwal will be an underdog but writing her off will be naive. (Source: File)

Saina Nehwal is still battling the effects of a debilitating knee injury and at 27 is the oldest among the Top-20 in the world. At the Glasgow World Championships, Indian badminton’s trailblazer will be an underdog but writing her off will be naive. Indian Express argues why Nehwal remains a force.

Saina Nehwal is about to embark on yet another round of beat ’em ups. Her buddy of many years, Parupalli Kashyap, is gloating he’s won every single turn of Mortal Kombat, whenever Saina drops by in Hyderabad and the group of friends hit the consoles at one of the guys’ homes. It’s an unchanged routine – a day before she flies out for tournaments from her home city, arriving from her training base Bangalore. No amount of losses have taken the edge off Saina’s fierce fervour to win this fighting game some day. On the eve of heading out to the World Championships, that competitive buzz is stinging the air again. “She wants that ‘champion’ thing now,” says Kashyap, though he isn’t talking of Mortal Kombat here. He meant in good ol’ badminton.

Two years ago, the monkey was off her back – Saina had ended a frustrating run of four quarterfinal losses at the World Championships, to clinch a silver behind Carolina Marin at Jakarta. Earlier in the season, she had medalled at the All England – a silver again behind the Spaniard. “If she had won those titles in 2015, it would’ve been different. I don’t see her simply competing, saying I’ve achieved all that I could. Probably, the burden of making the podium at the big events is off, but she badly wants those medals again. She wants the ‘champion’ thing now,” Kashyap repeats. “She’s super-duper hungry for title wins.”

Saina is far away from the spotlight that will obsessively follow the largest Indian contingent at the World Championships at Glasgow starting Monday. Saina, at 27 the oldest amongst the world’s current Top 20, plays a sport that isn’t sympathetic to those with aging limbs and dimming reflexes. Modern badminton is a young woman’s sport, at the Worlds every shuttler in the Top 10 is below 25.

The Haryanvi from Hyderabad had hobbled off the Rio Olympics – even as PV Sindhu stunningly and speedily took her spot on the pedestal. It’s the first agonising anniversary of the ACL trouble – a neat, dispassionate acronym for her knee having chipped into two. Her recent results too haven’t been encouraging. A Tier 3 title in Malaysia and many fragmented failures have probably been worse for her confidence than those bodily bruises. There aren’t many who are expecting miracles from the World No 15 – yes, the ranking’s spilled out of the hallowed Top 10 as well.

But because it’s Saina – none’s writing her off either. Even the clinical skeptics – who see waves and troughs coming from a mile, and suspect an imminent down-slide here based on her form and fitness – paint pictures of enthusiastic epilogues to Saina’s career, and how it can’t be resurrected. Kashyap had no doubts though. “When she returned from surgery to play in Macau, China and Hong Kong, I knew she’s going to come back and told her we were happy she’s playing again,” Kashyap recalls the November of last year. Saina hadn’t been content though. “Her very first tournament – she was hoping to win the title already!”

A one-act ‘comeback’ script though doesn’t make for the most engaging drama. Even Saina’s sporting hero Roger Federer took five years to regain his Grand Slam winning prowess. 2017 has seen him pick two Slam titles. The year has also witnessed the return of Rafael Nadal to World No 1. Saina picked up a racquet in Hissar where she was called Steffi Saina as a child. She would turn a Federer faithful as soon as he’d won Wimbledon in 2003. It’s the Federer-Nadal narratives that the massive tennis fan will routinely dig into for inspiration, though opinion is divided over how she ought to go about her comeback.

Her inner circle believes she will amp up what she’s been doing these last few years with a tweak here and an upgrade there. And there are others who reckon it’s time for an overhaul. No one’s quite rushing to call time on her career though – and the two F-words – Federer and fighter, keep popping up in conversations, summing up Saina ahead of a World Championship, where she’s firmly an underdog.

At some point in their three-year-long journey as coach, Vimal found the right subject for small-talk with Saina. The two threadbared tennis and talked a lot about Federer, an athlete they both love. It was while watching Federer’s backhand slice having morphed into a whipping weapon, that Vimal had realised that Nehwal 2.0 was going to need similar tweaks. What had been a defensive shot was turned into an attacking kill. The Swiss legend, by driving through the backhand, would cut down on the rallies, thus putting less strain on his back and knee.

“Earlier Federer used to mistime it, now he has winners under pressure on that backhand. Saina too needs to add variations to her strokes. It’s not so much of learning a new stroke, as shot-making from different positions,” Vimal says. In Australia, Saina’s last outing, she had been guilty of returning to mindless attacking as her fall-back mode, even when she had varied choices of shots at her disposal. The plan was to mix the deceptive clears with drops and smashes but she would keep switching to her favourite hyper-attacking template. The tactical bungle would be instrumental in denying her the chance to defend her title Down Under. “From Federer she can also learn how to remain focussed and wriggle out of tough situations. Her game is more like Nadal’s, but Federer is what we need to follow on picking which tournaments to play and when to take a break, and finally not get bogged down by rankings,” the coach adds.

Saina isn’t likely to jaunt off to Nilgiris like Federer went skiing in the Swiss Alps. However, the tennis legend’s shortened clay season and smart breaks are pointers that Saina’s team will riff off from. The fitness and intensity – just enough – that Federer maintained in those strategic breaks, is what legends across the world are attempting to figure out.

“It’s not always about working hard, but working smart. We were all saying Federer’s career is over, but look how he’s back,” says Heath Matthews who worked with Saina in the months post her surgery. “I can’t prescribe heavy workloads to her because muscle tissues have to heal. Her travelling physio Aravind Nigam too has struck a balance where we push her to the absolute bare minimum to take her to 100 percent. Once she reaches that point, not one repetition extra,” he says. While shuttle legends Lee Chong Wei and Lin Dan will be closely watched to see if they can use the Roger code to stretch their careers upto Tokyo 2020, in women’s singles, Saina is the most likely to dip into the Federer formula.

The depths of her dark days will be consigned to history the moment Saina strikes a title, though those close to her are simply happy to see where she is a year after the Rio catastrophe. “Can’t tell you how much it had hurt her,” Kashyap remembers, though he himself had realised three months before the Games that his own Olympics pursuit was over owing to a spate of injuries. “At least I had time to make peace with what had happened and tell myself inane stuff like ‘it’s not written for you.” In Saina’s case, two weeks before the Olympics, the pain started. It was horrible and she would cry on the days when it didn’t go down. Then she desperately took the cortisone injection and hoped that somehow the pain would subside.

“Her pain threshold was crazy, because the doctor there was shocked and asked how the hell did she even step on court, when a piece of the bone was pricking her every second,” he recalls. “She expected till the last day that she would be able to play, but ..” Her leg had been in tumult. Lunging on the knee a 100 times a day in practice typically leads to a pull on the bone. The bone in self-preservation strengthens itself – except in Saina’s case it grew more than it should have and literally chipped off inside the knee. “People casually said she was under pressure and she choked. It was a torrid time,” Kashyap recalls. Fitness levels in badminton have gone through the roof, matches are routinely 1 hour-long and the taxing schedule means no one’s immune to walking wounded on shuttle courts in women’s singles.

Saina was uncharacteristically not prone to injury in her first few years – leading to 10 Super Series titles and medals at every major. The entire Chinese pack too was felled by injuries in Olympics year. Carolina Marin, Xuerui Li, Ratchanok have all faced injury troubles – most others play with both knees strapped at all times. Nehwal had played the 2015 World Championship finals with a groin strain – another painful episode, though Heath Matthews has never heard her reel off an excuse of injury after a loss.

“For a professional athlete, Olympics is the pinnacle and Saina had been World No 1 in between the two Games, and was looking forward to Rio. She tried to play through it, but it came as a big blow. But there’s nothing she loves more than badminton, and though her character has been tested this last one year and she’s lost close matches to players she can’t tangibly understand how, and kept her belief through a long rehab, there’s not a doubt that she’s on the cusp of a good year now,” Matthews says.

Some unconventional resistance work has gone into improving her speed, which will paper over the age-obstacle that’ll get thrown at her often. “27 is not old, and I’m not considering her age at all. She’s moving much better now, and we are going to take her speed to a level where she puts her younger opponents under time pressure,” he adds.

Saina somewhat specialised in rattling her opponents even when she first entered the circuit at 16 – though her chosen weapon was power. It’s the speed that they plan to prop up now. Saina’s team is keen that she doesn’t alter her game drastically to compensate for her surgery, and she’s begun pushing her knee as confidence has returned to her lunging stride. While Vimal insists that her tactics and shot selection leave much to be desired – the last year has indeed been a learning curve in dealing with the reality that it’s not easy to return and resume winning like before. With much grieving of losses, he insists that Saina realised she’s far away from getting to the top again, though the enjoyment she derived from court sessions remained undiminished.

Viren Rasquinha, whose OGQ have backed her all these years, was in Bangalore in Saina’s last week of training. Though he’s noticed the beginnings of an ability to switch on-switch off – rare for the intense athlete who’s always had to be pulled back from over-training – he was pleased with the familiar Saina sight. “After a 3-hour-long session, everyone was bending down exhausted, hands on hips. She walked up to Vimal Sir and asked ‘What’s next?’”

One key reason why Saina’s team believes she’s still some time away from entirely reinventing her game is because she is yet to see the results of playing with 100 percent fitness. They reckon she’s been operating at 80 per cent, and once she hits the high notes, she’ll be able to regain her lost form. Saina herself is believed to still feel the rush when she moves freely and when she can train without getting tired, though the losses have hurt.

“If you reach peak fitness and still the game’s not working for you, then we can start thinking of reinventing,” says a key member of her support staff. Saina needs to learn a couple of difficult don’ts – don’t worry about rankings, don’t peak for smaller tournaments. “Some people find it tough to hold back. But she’s smart enough to learn this eventually,” Kashyap says.

There’s a sneaking feeling amongst those detached from her immediate circle that she’s looking for luck, hoping something external conspires to make things work again. “She needs a couple of changes to her team. What she’s doing isn’t working entirely. Even their best intention might not prove good enough,” says a former player, who adds that though motivation is never a problem with her, the small details are not in place to reach the top of the world again. Some others believe that the time is right for her to go easy on herself. “She needs to chill a bit, tweak a few things, but stop comparing her to herself of some years ago,” says former international Aparna Popat.

“She has nothing to prove to anyone. Someone needs to tell her that nobody can take away what she’s achieved and she will always be considered the path-breaker. What we now want to see is Saina enjoying herself on court. She’s taken the burden for 10 years, now if she can play freely, she’ll win much more,” she says. There’s those that believe that anything from now is a bonus and Saina will never be able to win solely on ‘fitness’ again, hence the need to revamp her game like Federer, and then there’s others who feel that urgency is important in addressing her fitness program, because it’s only going to get tougher from here. For every

Federer dream run, there’s the Usain Bolt stumble for those pushing their luck. There’s consensus that Saina doesn’t need to charge into all 12 Super Series with the intent of winning them all and should pace herself for the big titles. No one spoken to for this story, expressed a single doubt that Saina ever lacks in commitment when in training or in a match. “It’s easy for all of us to tell her. But Saina hates losing and wants to play well at all times. I dont want to change that mentality.

The Philippines has deployed more troops to cull thousands of chickens one day after the farm ministry confirmed the spread of bird flu into a second province north of the capital, Manila. More than 100 soldiers were sent on Saturday to the towns of Jaen and San Isidro in Nueva Ecija province after two cases of avian flu were detected in quails, army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Isagani Nato said in a statement.

The new bird flu cases were about 50 km (30 miles) from the initial outbreak in a swampy area of Pampanga that is a sanctuary for migratory birds from China. Authorities have not determined the cause of the bird flu outbreak, nor the exact strain, on which tests are being done in Australia. There has been no case of human transmission in either outbreak, and early tests have ruled out lhighly pathogenic H5N1 strain.

Nato said the deployment in Nueva Ecija followed a request from the Bureau of Animal Industry in the Department of Agriculture for assistance “after confirming a new incident of bird flu outbreak”. He said troops were now undergoing training on how to do their jobs. The 300 soldiers sent to Pampanga on Thursday culled nearly 30,000 chicken from a farm within a one kilometre radius of the first bird flu outbreak. The farm ministry said about 600,000 chickens on about 36 farms in Pampanga will be culled. It did not say how many will be culled in the second province.

Boston: ‘Free speech rally’ cut short after massive counter-protest,"Counterprotesters hold signs at a “Free Speech” rally by conservative activists on Boston Common, Saturday in Boston.

Thousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday on downtown Boston in a boisterous repudiation of white nationalism, dwarfing a small group of conservatives who cut short their planned “free speech rally” a week after a gathering of hate groups led to bloodshed in Virginia.

Counterprotesters marched through the city to historic Boston Common, where many gathered near a bandstand abandoned early by conservatives who had planned to deliver a series of speeches. Police vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counter-protesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.

Members of the Black Lives Matter movement later protested on the Common, where a Confederate flag was burned and protesters pounded on the sides of a police vehicle. Later Saturday afternoon, Boston’s police department tweeted that protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them and asked people publicly to refrain from doing so. Boston Commissioner William Evans said 27 arrests were made _ mostly for disorderly conduct while some were for assaulting police officers. Officials said the rallies drew about 40,000 people.

Trump applauded the people in Boston who he said were “speaking out” against bigotry and hate. Trump added in a Twitter message that “Our country will soon come together as one!”

Organizers of the event, which had been billed as a “Free Speech Rally,” had publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. A woman was killed at that Unite the Right rally, and many others were injured, when a car plowed into counterdemonstrators.

Opponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the specter of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering in a major U.S. city since Charlottesville. One of the planned speakers of the conservative activist rally said the event “fell apart.” Congressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, told WCVB-TV that he didn’t realize “how unplanned of an event it was going to be.”

Some counter-protesters dressed entirely in black and wore bandannas over their faces. They chanted anti-Nazi and anti-fascism slogans, and waved signs that said: “Make Nazis Afraid Again,” “Love your neighbor,” “Resist fascism” and “Hate never made US great.” Others carried a large banner that read: “SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY.”

Chris Hood, a free speech rally attendee from Dorchester, said people were unfairly making it seem like the rally was going to be “a white supremacist Klan rally.” “That was never the intention,” he said. “We’ve only come here to promote free speech on college campuses, free speech on social media for conservative, right-wing speakers. And we have no intention of violence.” Rockeem Robinson, a youth counselor from Cambridge, said he joined the counter-protest to “show support for the black community and for all minority communities.”

TV cameras showed a group of boisterous counter-protesters on the Common chasing a man with a Trump campaign banner and cap, shouting and swearing at him. But other counter-protesters intervened and helped the man safely over a fence into the area where the conservative rally was to be staged. Black-clad counter-protesters also grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman’s hands, and she stumbled and fell to the ground.

Saturday’s showdown was mostly peaceable, and after demonstrators dispersed, a picnic atmosphere took over with stragglers tossing beach balls, banging on bongo drums and playing reggae music. The Boston Free Speech Coalition, which organized the event, said it has nothing to do with white nationalism or racism and its group is not affiliated with the Charlottesville rally organizers in any way.

Rallies in other cities around the country each attracted hundreds of people who wanted to show their opposition to white supremacist groups. Counterprotesters marched through New Orleans, some of them carrying signs that read “White People Against White Supremacy” and “Black Lives Matter.”

In Atlanta, a diverse crowd marched from the city’s downtown to the home of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Meredith Dubé brought along her two daughters, 2-year-old Willow Dubé and 12-year-old Rai Chin. Dubé is white and her daughters are mixed race. She said it is essential to show children at an early age that love is more powerful than hate.

An anti-racism rally was held in Laguna Beach, California, one day before the group America First! planned to hold a demonstration in the same place that’s being billed as an “Electric Vigil for the Victims of Illegals and Refugees.” Mayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that “Laguna Beach doesn’t tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.”

In Dallas, officials were expecting thousands of people for a Saturday evening rally against white supremacy at city hall plaza, a short distance from the city’s Confederate War Memorial. About a half-dozen people wearing camouflage and toting guns patrolled Pioneer Park and its Civil War cemetery. They said they were there to make sure there was no vandalism to graves or the Confederate memorial.

"Centre to provide monthly fellowship of Rs 70,000 for IIT and IISc Bengaluru PhD researchers","Presently researcher-students get Rs 25,000 as monthly scholarship at IITs. Presently researcher-students get Rs 25,000 as monthly scholarship at IITs.

The Centre will provide Rs 70,000 as monthly fellowship to those researchers doing their PhDs in IITs or IISc, Union higher education secretary Kewal Kumar Sharma has said. Presently researcher-students get Rs 25,000 as monthly scholarship at IITs. “As part of the research fellowship scheme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we wish the meritorious students who are being forced to leave the country for purely financial reasons stay within the country.”

“We will provide 2,000 such monthly fellowships across the IIT system and IISc Bengaluru,” Sharma said at the 67th Foundation Day of IIT Kharagpur at its Kharagpur campus in West Midnapore district on Friday. It will be given for a period of five years, he said.

This will also enable meritorious researchers, keen to further their research but forced to opt for corporate jobs for higher pay, to pursue their goal, he said. However, the scholarship recipients can’t do any other job, the senior official said.

“The cabinet nod for the proposal should come soon. We are hopeful to start it from the next session,” he said.

IIT-KGP director Partha Pratim Chakrabarti later said, “This is a very good proposal.”

Transfer-seeking Riyad Mahrez stars in Leicester City win,"Riyad Mahrez (R) put in a transfer request during the off-season. (Source: AP) Riyad Mahrez (R) put in a transfer request during the off-season. (Source: AP)

Riyad Mahrez showed potential suitors what they could be getting by inspiring Leicester to a 2-0 win over Brighton in the English Premier League on Saturday.

The Algeria winger put in a transfer request during the off-season but Leicester hasn’t received a suitable offer, rejecting three bids from Italian side Roma.

Setting up both goals against Brighton, and demonstrating the kind of form that earned him the player of the year award after Leicester’s title-winning season in 2015-16, might help secure him a move away before the transfer window shuts on Aug. 31.

Leicester, which opened the season by losing at Arsenal 4-3, went ahead after 52 seconds when Mahrez tricked his way into the area and curled in a shot that goalkeeper Mathew Ryan should have dealt with.

Instead, the Australia international spilled the ball straight to the waiting Shinji Okazaki, who tapped in his second goal of the season.

Mahrez sent in the corner that Harry Maguire nodded in to make it 2-0 in the 54th, the defender’s first goal since joining from Hull.

Food Review: Twist of Taste,"Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant. Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant.

With a modern dining room that exposes its busy brigade of chefs through a glass panel on the ground floor, and a cosier, more sequestered space tailored for groups of four or more on the floor above, where jazz plays unobtrusively and mood lighting nudges the gaze towards the table, W. D. House makes one thing very clear: your focus is meant to be on the food.

W. D. House travelled south from Chandigarh, where it is both recognised and glorified, to Delhi last month. Much like its neighbour in GK II’s M block, China Garden, the fine dining restaurant opens itself to patrons from noon to 3.30 pm and then from 7 pm to midnight. This edition of W.D. or Whistling Duck, aims to encourage conversations about the “indigenous modernity” of the ’40s and ‘50s — asserted with a single stem rose perched on tables dressed in lily-white covers and cane chairs, but also with its food. An ambitious menu — that can, perhaps, leave one confused — offers regional Indian, Southeast Asian, and European cuisines.

But, confusion is not a welcome guest here, and is soon defenestrated as head chef Richa Johari takes one through the menu. It is, then, easy to realise that the food here is as straightforward as her. You get what you ask for, but with a twist. Take, for instance, the Rhododendron squash, an enchanting, deep-pink drink made of the sweetly-scented flowers from Uttarakhand with celery and black salt. Or the Pashtun-style Chappali Kebabs, a compound of goat meat, coriander seeds, vetiver roots and pomegranate seeds, that followed soon after. The little frills are only a reflection of Johari’s deft hand with spices, and a result of her attention to detail evident in her zen-like precision to presentation.

Another first course that topped the must-try chart at this restaurant was Tabak Maaz from Kashmir. Succulent goat ribs garnished with onions pickled in mustard were accompanied by a plum and ginger chutney, leaving each bite with a lingering hint of piquant. Even with the Almond Crab Cake — flakes of almond-coated fat crab patties to be paired with a gandhraj (strong scented citrus from Kolkata) aioli — the flavours were neither big nor subtle. An attempt at choreographing a duet of textures came through in all the dishes.

If you want to better your relationship with karela, or bitter gourd, W.D. House should be your choice of counsellor. Rings of bitter gourd coated in batter and deep fried were tossed in a raw mango murabba dressing with raw onion, heirloom tomatoes and cucumber slices. This dish has the potential to convert the most ardent karela dismissers.

Another orthodox yet atypical offering from the restaurant’s kitchen was the Guay Tiew Moo, a dish popular in Thailand. Traditionally made with the meat that must not be named, this one was with pork that sat in the deep end of a bowl, amid lettuce, sprouts, and flat noodles, brimming with galangal flavoured broth with seemingly harmless red chillies that gave the soup a bit of a jolt. For the mains, a dish from Jharkhand, Dhuska — deep-fried discs made with rice, lentils and chillies — was paired with a chicken saag curry.

The dhuska mellowed the sharpness of the mustard oil that the chicken was cooked in, resulting in a harmony of flavours. The other main, a ravioli of blue cheese in a smooth, brighter-than-the-sun yellow, pumpkin puree came drizzled with basil flavoured olive oil and pine nuts. The umami from the parmesan, pungency of the blue cheese and sweetness of the pumpkin worked beautifully together, but the pasta was not al dente enough.

For dessert, we dug into the basil and lime cheesecake topped with a grape and balsamic reduction. The pairing of the basil with the reduction lent a sophisticated touch to the albeit slightly dry cheesecake, making for an intriguing conclusion to the eclectic meal.

"Turkish political refugees flock to Germany, seeking safety","In this Tuesday, May 23, 2017 photo, a young Turkish artist sits on a bench during an interview with The Associated Press in Berlin. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) In this Tuesday, May 23, 2017 photo, a young Turkish artist sits on a bench during an interview with The Associated Press in Berlin. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn)

The Turkish judge sits in a busy cafe in a big German city. Thirteen months ago, he was a respected public servant in his homeland. Now he is heartbroken and angry over the nightmarish turn of events that brought him here. The day after a 2016 coup attempt shook Turkey, he was blacklisted along with thousands of other judges and prosecutors. The judge smiles, sadly, as he recounts hiding at a friend’s home, hugging his crying son goodbye and paying smugglers to get him to safety.

“I’m very sad I had to leave my country,” he said, asking for his name and location to be withheld out of fear that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government might track him down. “But at least I’m safe and out of Erdogan’s reach. He cannot hurt me anymore.”

Germany has become the top destination for political refugees from Turkey since the failed July 15, 2016 coup. Some 5,742 Turkish citizens applied for asylum here last year, more than three times as many as the year before, according to the Interior Ministry. Another 3,000 Turks have requested protection in Germany this year.

The figures include people fleeing a long-simmering conflict in the Kurdish region of southeastern Turkey, but the vast majority belong to a new class of political refugees: diplomats, civil servants, military members, academics, artists, journalists and anti-Erdogan activists accused of supporting the coup.

With many of them university-educated and part of the former elite, “their escape has already turned into a brain-drain for Turkey,” said Caner Aver, a researcher at the Center for Turkish Studies and Integration Research in Essen. Germany is a popular destination because it’s already home to about 3.5 million people with Turkish roots and has been more welcoming of the new diaspora than other Western nations, Aver said.

“Some of the highly qualified people also try getting to the U.S. and Canada because most speak English, not German. But it’s just much harder to get there,” Aver said. “Britain has always been popular, but less so now because of Brexit.”

Comparable figures for post-coup asylum requests from Turks were not available for other countries.

More than 50,000 people have been arrested in Turkey and 110,000 dismissed from their jobs for alleged links to political organizations the government has categorized as terror groups or to U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Ankara blames the Muslim cleric, a former Erdogan ally, for the coup attempt. Gulen denies the claim.

The true number of recent Turkish arrivals to Germany exceeds official asylum requests. Many fleeing academics, artists and journalists came on scholarships from German universities or political foundations. Some got in via relatives. Others entered with visas obtained before the failed coup.

The judge, a slim man in his 30s with glasses, arrived illegally by paying thousands of euros to cross from Turkey to Greece on a rubber dinghy and then continuing on to Germany. Two other Turks in Germany — an artist who asked for anonymity, fearing repercussions for her family back home, and a journalist sentenced to prison in absentia — also spoke of ostracism and flight.

Ismail Eskin, the journalist, left Turkey just before he was sentenced to 3½ years in prison on terrorism-related charges. The 29-year-old worked for the Ozgur Gundem newspaper and the Kurdish news agency Dicle Haber Ajansi until the government shut them down shortly after the failed coup.

Eskin tried to write for different online news sites but the Turkish government blocked them too. He reluctantly decided to leave when the situation became unbearably difficult for journalists — about 160 are now in jail.

“I kept changing places to avoid being arrested, and I hid that I was a journalist,” Eskin said, chain-smoking at a Kurdish immigrants’ center. He hasn’t applied for asylum but is studying German — an acknowledgment he might be here to stay.

The judge said he “never supported any kind of coup” and had no connection to the Gulen movement but took hurriedly packed a few belongings and went to a friend’s place after learning he was among more than 2,000 judges and prosecutors being investigated. A few hours later, police searched his apartment and took his computer.

His wife and children had been out of town during the coup attempt. While he was in hiding, his wife was told she had 15 days to move out. Friends and relatives stopped talking to her. After several months, he chose to leave.

“Since there’s no independent justice in Turkey anymore, I would have been exposed to injustice, maybe be tortured, if I had surrendered,” he said.

He sold his car and paid 8,500 euros ($9,910) to a smuggler for a December boat trip to a Greek island. From there, he flew to Italy and on to Germany. He brought his wife, son and daughter to join him a few weeks later.

The number of Turkish citizens fleeing to Germany has complicated the already tense relations between Ankara and Berlin. Accusing Germany of harboring terrorists, Turkey has demanded the extradition of escaped Turkish military officers and diplomats.

At least 221 diplomats, 280 civil servants and their families have applied for asylum, Germany says. Along with refusing to comply with the extradition requests, Germany has lowered the bar for Turkish asylum-seekers — those given permission to remain increased from 8 percent of applicants last year to more than 23 percent in the first half of 2017.

Some Turkish emigres have started building new lives in exile. The artist from Istanbul lost her university job in graphic design before the 2016 coup because she was one of more than 1,000 academics who triggered Erdogan’s ire by signing a “declaration for peace” in Turkey.

She went to Berlin on a university scholarship in September, not long after the attempted coup. In February, she discovered she’d been named a terror group supporter and her Turkish passport was invalidated.

“Now I’m forced into exile, but that’s better than to be inside the country,” the woman in her early 30s said.

The artist said she’s doing fine in Berlin. She enrolled at a university and has had her work exhibited at a small gallery. Yet with her family still in Turkey, some days the enormity of the change weighs on her.

“In the winter I was so homesick,” she said. “I really felt like a foreigner, in my veins and in my bones.”

"Trading in Inter Globe Finance to resume from Monday, says Bombay Stock Exchange","Bombay Stock exchange on Dalal Street. (Express Archive Photo) Bombay Stock exchange on Dalal Street. (Express Archive Photo)

Leading stock exchange BSE has said trading in Inter Globe Finance shares will resume from tomorrow after the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) stayed curbs imposed on the company. The shares of the company will be moved out of GSM (graded surveillance measures) framework and will be available for trading with effect from August 21, the exchange said in a circular. It will be allowed to trade in a price band of five percent.

The move comes after the SAT, last week, stayed trading restrictions imposed on the company which figured in a list of 331 “suspected shell companies” referred by the government to Sebi. In addition, the tribunal lifted the trading curbs imposed on Sanco Industries, which is listed on the NSE. So far, the tribunal has stayed trading restrictions imposed on a total of 10 companies, including JK Infra projectsand Parsvnath Developers. The appellants had submitted their respective financials,along with other filings, before SAT to establish that they are not shell companies and are in compliance with all regulations.

Sebi, on August 7, had asked stock exchanges to restrict trading in shares of 331 “suspected shell companies”, some of which have investments by several well-known domestic and foreign investors. Subsequently, the exchanges had moved such stocks to the highest sixth grade of GSM, where the shares are allowed to trade only on first Monday of the month with no upward movement in price, with additional surveillance deposit of 200 per cent of trade value to be deposited by the buyers. Sebi had received the list of such companies from the corporate affairs ministry and many of the 331 firms are under the scanner of Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO)and the income tax department

"Meet Hope Hicks, 28, Donald Trump’s new communications director","In this photo June 30, 2017, Hope Hicks arrives on Air Force One at Morristown Municipal Airport, in Morristown, N.J., en route to Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J..

After three people tackled the assignment with limited success, the job of keeping President Donald Trump on message has for now fallen to Hope Hicks, a young former public relations aide and political neophyte who entered his orbit not knowing the ride would eventually take her into the cutthroat world of Washington politics.

Word of Hicks’ promotion _ she already was director of “strategic” communications at the White House _ landed this week just as she and other top Trump aides confronted one of the biggest communications challenges in recent memory.

After Trump went off message and blamed “both sides” for deadly violence between white supremacists and counter-protesters at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, blowback was sharp and swift. Members of Congress in both parties urged a defiant president to more forcefully denounce the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who marched through the college town. Other lawmakers openly questioned the president’s competence and moral leadership. Business leaders whom Trump, a businessman himself, enjoyed inviting to the White House fled the advisory boards they had agreed to serve on, while leaders of the armed services denounced racism and hatred without naming their commander in chief.

Repairing the breach, or at least keeping it from growing, is among the most immediate tasks facing the 28-year-old native of Greenwich, Connecticut. She succeeds Anthony Scaramucci, another flamboyant New York businessman, whose 11-day tenure as White House communications director ended after an expletive-filled tirade to a reporter about his new office mates.

“Hope is a terrific person and will do a great job. Wishing her the best,” Scaramucci tweeted after the White House announced Hicks’ promotion. She will help shape and steer White House messaging until someone who wants the assignment permanently _ who would be the fifth person in less than a year _ comes aboard.

Those who have worked with the shy, former teen model describe her as trustworthy.

“Hope is wise beyond her years and is someone I trust to always be there for the president,” said Brad Parscale, the digital director of Trump’s presidential campaign who, like Hicks, was one of Trump’s few original campaign members. “I have been disappointed in seeing so many use President Trump as an opportunity to maximize their own self-interest.”

Hicks avoids the spotlight, unlike colleagues who got under Trump’s skin by letting their profiles rise.

Hick has long served as a gatekeeper to Trump and now plays the role from her desk near the Oval Office. As was the arrangement during the campaign, media requests to interview the president go through Hicks, and she was the only aide in the Oval Office when Trump sharply criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a recent New York Times interview. She does not do television appearances.

Parscale said Hicks is dedicated to Trump’s broader aims.

“His campaign was about millions of Americans across this country who have been left behind,” Parscale said, adding that Hicks understands that and “truly wants to see President Trump succeed.”

A former Ralph Lauren fashion model and public relations pro who worked for Trump’s daughter Ivanka, Hicks had no political background when she signed on for the celebrity businessman’s fledgling campaign in 2015. Soon, she essentially became a one-woman communications shop for an unconventional campaign that attracted unprecedented media attention.

She approved interview requests, often tapped out tweets he dictated and remained at his side as he barnstormed the country.

Hicks followed her parents, Paul and Caye Hicks, public relations professionals, into the business. After graduating in 2010 from Southern Methodist University with a degree in English, she moved to New York and worked with Hiltzik Strategies, which has also worked for Hillary Clinton _ as did her father. Paul Hicks used to do communications for the NFL, and is now managing partner at a firm in Washington. In 2014, Hicks joined the Trump Organization to help promote Ivanka’s merchandise. A year later, Trump brought her onto the campaign.

She attracted considerable media attention on her own, but largely eschewed face-to-face interactions with reporters, and almost never joined them for off-the-record socializing. Her interactions were almost always limited to the phone and email.

Don’t look for Hicks to try to curb Trump’s tweeting, as others have urged him to do.

“You can own the news cycle with one tweet and I think that speaks to both the power of his presence and personality, but also his message, and his ability to captivate,” she said in a brief video for Forbes magazine’s “30 Under 30” series. Hicks is not on Twitter.

In Mobile, Alabama, during the transition, Trump cajoled her to say a few words to tens of thousands of supporters who turned out for a “Thank You” rally after the election.

“Where is Hope? Where is Hope? Hope, get up here, Hope. Hope, get up here,” Trump said.

“She’s always on the phone talking to the reporters, trying to get the reporters to straighten out their dishonest stories,” Trump said, adding that Hicks is a “tremendously talented person.”

“She’s a little shy, but that’s OK because she is really, really talented,” Trump added, before beseeching her to “say a couple of words.”

Hicks said nine. “Hi. Merry Christmas everyone, and thank you, Donald Trump.”

Flight operations suspended at Delhi airport after ‘drone-like object’ spotted on runway,"All three runways shut at Delhi airport. All three runways shut at Delhi airport.

Flight operations at Delhi airport were suspended for over half-an-hour on Sundy evening after a “drone-like object” was spotted in one of the runways. The “drone-like object” was spotted by an Air Asia pilot about 1909 hours. Many flights were diverted as the operations were suspended for about 40 minutes. The flight operations resumed at 1955 hours after clearance from the Delhi Police.

Sanjay Bhatia, Deputy Commissioner of Police at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, said the pilot who was flying from Goa to Delhi reported having seen the object near Dwarka area adjoining the airport around 7.10 p.m. “In this regard, operations at all the three runways were closed as a precautionary measure. At about 7.55 p.m., the operations at the three runways resumed normally after clearance from Delhi Police,” Bhatia said.

AirAsia India, in a statement, confirmed that the pilots of flight i5 799 spotted unidentified object flying close to aircraft while landing.

The Virat Kohli-led Indian team stamped authority in Test cricket after they attained 3-0 win in three-match series against Sri Lanka. They now move to Dambulla where Kohli and co. will lock horns with hosts Sri Lanka in first ODI of the five-match series. Skipper Virat uploaded a picture on his Twitter account and wrote, “At Dambulla for the ODIs now, another beautiful location. 😊🔝”

Virat Kohli has tasted success as a skipper in ODI cricket as well after taking up the full time role from MS Dhoni earlier this year. India under him defeated England at home while ended as runners up in Champions Trophy 2017. They last played a five-match ODI series against West Indies away from home and defeated them 3-1. Kohli’s troops would now be looking to continue their form against Sri Lanka as well.

Hosts Sri Lanka on the other side have faced a few problems especially in the shorter format. They lost ODI series 3-1 to Zimbabwe at home earlier. The last time these two teams met each other in an ODI was during Champions Trophy and the Virat Kohli-led team stood on the losing side in that particular game.

It all started on this very chair, this very date and this very ground. 9 years today with the Indian cricket team! So grateful. 🙏 @BCCI pic.twitter.com/23vEL1tO3K — Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) 18 August 2017

Aurangabad Municipality: Corporators suspended for refusing to stand up for Vande Mataram,"Mayor Bhagwan Ghadamode subsequently ordered that Sayyed Mateen of the All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and Sohail Shaikh of the Congress be suspended for a day (ANI) Mayor Bhagwan Ghadamode subsequently ordered that Sayyed Mateen of the All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and Sohail Shaikh of the Congress be suspended for a day (ANI)

A fight broke out between some members of Aurangabad municipality in Maharashtra and an AIMIM and a Congress corporator were suspended for a day after they allegedly refused to stand up when ‘Vande Mataram’ was being sung in the House during a general body meeting Saturday. Objecting to their conduct, ruling Shiv Sena-BJP corporators rushed into the Well and pressed for action against the two corporators. Mayor Bhagwan Ghadamode subsequently ordered that Sayyed Mateen of the All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and Sohail Shaikh of the Congress be suspended for a day.

Amid the din, some Sena and AIMIM corporators came to blows — although no one was injured, civic officials said some microphones were damaged. The mayor later ordered suspension of another AIMIM corporator, Shaikh Nagar, for the violence and directed officials to register an offence against him.

The AIMIM was quick to distance itself from Saturday’s incident. The party’s Aurangabad MLA, Imtiyaz Jaleel, said, “No one should disrespect the national song.” While saying that the party will hold an internal probe to look into Mateen’s conduct, Jaleel alleged that the entire episode is a “deliberate ploy” of the ruling Sena-BJP alliance to divert attention from non-performance on development issues in the municipality.

While the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance leads the Aurangabad civic body with 58 corporators in the 113-member general body, the AIMIM is the largest opposition party with 23 members. Previously, a similar melee was seen over singing of the national song in Meerut and Varanasi municipalities in Uttar Pradesh. On August 11, there was a ruckus in Maharashtra Assembly after BJP MLA Raj Purohit demanded that Vande Mataram be made compulsory in all schools and colleges. The BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation has passed a motion making singing of Vande Mataram mandatory in all BMC-run schools.

"Infosys board clears proposal for Rs 13,000-cr share buyback","The Rs 13,000-crore buyback scheme, which will begin on a yet-to-be-announced date, will see the company plough back 20.51 per cent of its paid-up equity and free reserves of cash as on June 30, 2017 to the shareholders of the firm. The Rs 13,000-crore buyback scheme, which will begin on a yet-to-be-announced date, will see the company plough back 20.51 per cent of its paid-up equity and free reserves of cash as on June 30, 2017 to the shareholders of the firm.

A day after Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka announced his resignation, the board of directors of the tech company on Saturday cleared a proposal to buy back shares worth Rs 13,000 crore as part of its efforts to plough back cash reserves to shareholders.

“The buyback offer of shares will comprise a purchase of up to 11,30,43,478 equity shares aggregating up to 4.92 per cent of the paid-up equity share of the company at a price of Rs 1,150 per equity share,’’ the company said in a communication issued to stock exchanges on Saturday.

The buyback price is 24 per cent above the Friday’s closing price for the company’s share of Rs 923.15. The Infosys share had fallen Rs 97.70, or 9.57 per cent, on Friday following the exit of Sikka amidst an unstable relationship between the board of directors of the company, the management and a group of founder shareholders led by chief founder of the $10 billion company, N R Narayana Murthy.

The Rs 13,000-crore buyback scheme, which will begin on a yet-to-be-announced date, will see the company plough back 20.51 per cent of its paid-up equity and free reserves of cash as on June 30, 2017 to the shareholders of the firm.

The price identified by the board of Infosys is at a premium of 17.73 per cent and 17.92 percent above the share price on the BSE and the National Stock Exchange when Infosys Ltd informed the stock exchanges on August 16 about the buyback plan. It is also 19.08 and 18.70 per cent over the volume weighted average market price of the share on the BSE and the NSE in the three months prior to the date of the announcement of the buyback.

In February 2017, amid the row between the co-founders and the board and CEO, the IT giant’s former CFO V Balakrishnan had demanded buyback of shares to protect the interest of shareholders.

Infosys will be following in the footsteps of India’s number one IT services company Tata Consultancy Services, which came out with a Rs 16000 crore share buyback in May this year.

Indian IT services companies have been under pressure to return excess cash in their books to shareholders through share buybacks.

Venezuela Supreme Court orders dissident lawmaker’s arrest,"Venezuela’s high court issued an arrest order for the ousted chief prosecutor’s husband after authorities accused him of running a USD 6 million extortion ring, a ruling promptly denounced by government critics as a move aimed at silencing opponents of President Nicolas Maduro. The government-stacked Supreme Court also announced yesterday that it was referring German Ferrer’s case to the new, all-powerful constitutional assembly.

The assembly was installed in early August at Maduro’s behest following a widely criticised vote, and late yesterday voted unanimously to lift Ferrer’s immunity from prosecution that comes with legislative office. Ferrer is a lawmaker formerly aligned with Maduro’s administration who has stood by his wife, Luisa Ortega Diaz, in denouncing the assembly’s creation.

In a written statement to local media, Ferrer denied signing documents that officials are holding up as evidence he opened a bank account in the Bahamas to facilitate transactions. “This government no longer has any limits or shame,” he wrote.

Tarek William Saab, who was named by the constitutional assembly to replace Ortega Diaz as chief prosecutor, said Wednesday that the alleged criminal ring extorted money from people including businessmen in the nation’s oil industry in return for protecting them from prosecution. Ruling socialist party leader Diosdado Cabello provided prosecutors with papers allegedly showing that Ferrer and others opened six bank accounts at the Bahamas branch of a Swiss bank.

In his statement, Ferrer said the documents “don’t pass muster.” Cabello’s involvement in the case led many to conclude it is politically motivated. Opposition lawmaker Henry Allup questioned the timing of the charges, asking why they appeared so soon after Ferrer broke publicly with Maduro’s government. “This is a way to intimidate,” he said.

Ferrer and Ortega’s whereabouts were not clear yesterday. Authorities raided their home the previous day. The constitutional assembly, which is tasked with rewriting the nation’s charter and trumps all other branches of government, has been condemned by dozens of foreign nations which refuse to recognise it.

Maduro did not hold a referendum asking Venezuelans to approve the formation of the assembly, instead going directly to the National Electoral Council to schedule a vote for its members that was boycotted by the opposition.

International voting technology firm Smartmatic, which provided the voting machines for the election, announced shortly after the vote that the government’s official turnout count was off by at least 1 million. The government-stacked electoral council is now proceeding with regional elections scheduled for October. Council president Tibisay Lucena announced Wednesday that the government was breaking with Smartmatic for future elections.

(Source: AP) Shikhar Dhawan continued from where he left in the Tests as he smashed an unbeaten 132 in the modest chase. (Source: AP)

India continue with their dominating run as they beat Sri Lanka by nine wickets in the first ODI of the five-match series. Chasing a modest 217-run target, the hosts made easy work and gunned down the total in the 29th over. Shikhar Dhawan, the visitors’ leading run-getter in the Tests, smashed an unbeaten 132 while Virat Kohli scored a fluent 82. Sri Lanka struggled to pick a wicket and the only success they had came in the fifth over when Rohit Sharma was run-out for four in the fifth over. No hosts’ bowlers made an impression and the fielding too was below-par.

Dhawan was dropped twice during his aggressive knock. First by Niroshan Dickwella when the left-hander was on 87 and later on 118 when Upul Tharanga made a mess of a running catch. With the thumping win, India take a 1-0 lead in the series. Earlier, India bowlers, especially the spinners, were disciplined in the ball and turned it India’s way in the middle overs. Axar Patel was pick of the bowlers with figures of 3/34; Kedar Jadhav, Jasprit Bumrah and Yuzvendra Chahal returned with two wickets each.

"No action taken in NGO scam; Bihar CM, Deputy CM should resign, demands Lalu Prasad","RJD supremo Lalu Prasad. (Source: PTI Photo) RJD supremo Lalu Prasad. (Source: PTI Photo)

RJD president Lalu Prasad on Sunday demanded the resignation of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi, saying the state government had not taken any action on the “mega scam”, involving ‘Srijan’, a Bhagalpur-based NGO. The ruling JD(U), however, said the government had recommended a CBI probe into the issue following Prasad’s demand and the RJD chief should now be patient.

Prasad told a press conference, “I was hearing Kumar’s speech at his party’s national council meeting on Saturday. He claimed that it was he who exposed the scam and ordered a probe. “But, the fact is that Kumar knew about the NGO’s scam for a long time. He sat over the probe and did not take any action.”

He also alleged that it was a “mega scam”, in which over Rs 15,000 crore of government money were looted.

On Kumar handing over the probe into the matter to the CBI, Prasad alleged that the JD(U) chief was “trying to befool the people” as there was an RBI circular, as per which any financial irregularity involving an amount of above Rs 30 crore would have to be investigated by the central probe agency.

He also claimed that the chief minister had not handed over the probe to the CBI of his own volition, as he had come to know that the Centre and the probe agency had got the information through the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that “Kumar is involved in it (scam)”.

“Only out of this fear (of getting implicated in the scam), Kumar surrendered before the BJP within two hours,” Prasad said without elaborating further.

The former Bihar chief minister alleged that Kumar did not act after a chartered accountant, Sanjit Kumar, wrote to him about the “scam” in 2013 or even after the RBI asked him in the same year to investigate it. Instead, the chief minister “protected the scamsters”, he alleged.

“Why did the state government not make public the report prepared on the direction of the district magistrate in 2013? The DM was later transferred,” Prasad said.

Holding Kumar and Sushil Modi responsible for the “scam”, the RJD chief demanded their resignation and said his party would continue with its movement till the two put in their papers.

After its August 27 rally at Patna, the RJD would submit documents related to the “scam” to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and CBI and also request the Supreme Court to monitor the probe through a special investigation team (SIT), he said.

Reacting to the RJD chief’s allegations, JD(U) spokesman and MLC Niraj Kumar said, “It was Lalu Prasad who had demanded a CBI probe into the matter and the state government has recommended it. He should have patience now.”

He also wondered why had Prasad “suddenly developed an affection” for the CBI, against which he had been spewing venom.

On the RJD chief’s demand for a Supreme Court-monitored probe, the JD(U) leader said he was free to approach the court.

The cases lodged in connection with the NGO’s alleged swindling of public money were being investigated by the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of the Bihar police. The chief minister recommended a CBI probe into the matter on August 17.

The state police have issued a lookout notice against the NGO’s secretary, Priya Kumar, and her husband Amit Kumar.

Thousands protest in Hong Kong over jailing of democracy activists,"Student leaders Lester Shum, Nathan Law and Alex Chow hug as they arrive at the High Court to face verdict on charges relating to the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement, also known as Occupy Central protests, in Hong Kong, China August 17, 2017.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu

Thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday to protest against the jailing of three young democracy activists, with many questioning the independence of the Chinese-ruled city’s judiciary. On Thursday, Joshua Wong, 20, Nathan Law, 24 and Alex Chow, 27, were jailed for six to eight months for unlawful assembly, dealing a blow to the youth-led push for universal suffrage and prompting accusations of political interference.

Thousands of people marched in sweltering temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius (86°F) to the Court of Final Appeal, carrying placards and banners denouncing the jailing of the activists. Former student leader Lester Shum, who helped organize Sunday’s rally, said the number of protesters was the highest since pro-democracy protests in 2014 that paralysed parts of the financial hub for 79 days. “This shows that the Hong Kong government, the Chinese Communist regime and the Department of Justice’s conspiracy to deter Hong Kong people from continuing to participate in politics and to protest using harsh laws and punishments has completely failed,” Shum said.

Protesters brandished a large banner saying: “It’s not a crime to fight against totalitarianism.” They shouted: “Release all political prisoners. Civil disobedience. We have no fear. We have no regrets.” Ray Wong, 24, leader of pro-independence group Hong Kong Indigenous, said the issue is uniting government opponents.

“Since the Umbrella movement, the radical and milder forces walked their own path,” he said, referring to the 2014 democracy movement. “We’re now standing together. It is a good start.” In Sunday’s protests, some signs said “Shame on Rimsky”, referring to Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen, who Reuters reported last week had overruled other legal officials who initially advised against pursuing jail terms for the three activists.

Wong and his colleagues triggered the 2014 mass street protests, which attracted hundreds of thousands at their peak, when they climbed into a courtyard fronting the city’s government headquarters. They were sentenced last year to non-jail terms including community service for unlawful assembly, but the Department of Justice applied for a review, seeking imprisonment.

On Friday, Yuen denied any “political motive” in seeking jail for the trio. The former British colony returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” agreement that ensured its freedoms, including a separate legal system. But Beijing has ultimate control and some Hong Kong people are concerned it is increasingly interfering to head off dissent.

5-YEAR DISQUALIFICATION

The jail terms for Wong, Law and Chow disqualify them from running for the legislature for the next five years. Lau Siu-lai, one of six legislators expelled from the city’s legislature this year over the manner in which she took her oath of office, said the sentences were unreasonably harsh. “It appears to be political suppression to strip away young people’s right to stand in elections,” she said.

“I hope people will pay attention … We need to protect Hong Kong’s’ rule of law.” Another protester carried a placard of Lady Justice with a red blindfold. “Hong Kong’s Lady Justice and the rule of law… are now being controlled by communists, and are now being twisted and she is now blind,” said 50-year-old artist Kacey Wong. While the decision to impose tougher sentences on the activists attracted widespread criticism in Hong Kong and overseas, the Hong Kong Bar Association and Law Society defended the court’s decision.

“Unfounded comments that judicial decisions were made or influenced by political considerations originating outside Hong Kong are unjustified and damaging to our legal system, and to Hong Kong as a whole,” they said in a joint statement on Friday.

ISIS used Wales companies to finance terror: Report,"The FBI disclosures will raise fears about the likelihood of further attacks in Europe. (File/Photo) The FBI disclosures will raise fears about the likelihood of further attacks in Europe. (File/Photo)

The Islamic State terror group has used a network of companies operating out of Wales in the UK to finance terror plots, including the recent attacks in Spain, a media report said on Sunday. In an incident in Barcelona, a white van sped down the popular Las Ramblas avenue packed full of tourists on August 17, knocking people down and killing 13. Then just eight hours later, attackers struck again at an seaside resort of Cambrils in Spain where a car rammed into pedestrians, injuring six civilians and a police officer. One of the civilians later died.

FBI documents seen by ‘The Sunday Times’ reveal that surveillance technology dispatched to Spain is believed to be linked to the development by the terror group of weaponised drones routed through the UK. Other purchases said to be routed through Cardiff in Wales include orders for “bug sweep units” and software to help launch rockets.

US court documents seen by the newspaper show the lengths to which individuals involved with the Wales companies went to mask their alleged activities. One of the firms — which shipped surveillance equipment to Madrid, Spain — appears to have been set up using the identity of a bogus director and shareholder called “Peter Soren”.

The name is believed to be an alias for Siful Sujan, a Bangladesh-origin IT expert and businessman behind the companies who left south Wales three years ago with his family to join the ISIS in Syria. He was later killed by a US drone strike in Raqqa, the terror group’s de facto capital.

Sujan and his associates originally set up the Ibacs network of companies to offer website and printing services to restaurants and takeaways. They operated out of an office on Alexandra Gate business park at Tremorfa in Cardiff.

But a probe involving the FBI in the US and British anti-terrorist police discovered that some of the companies became involved in more sinister activities after Sujan headed to Syria, where he was a senior figure in ISIS hacking operations and weapons development.

One of the Cardiff-based firms, Ibacstel Electronics, was used to send a total of USD 7,700 in 2015 to an ISIS supporter in Maryland, US, called Mohamed Elshinaway, 32, who pleaded guilty to terrorism charges last week.

In July 2015 a company called Advance Technology Global (ATG) was created and registered at the Alexandra Gate business address, the FBI claims.

Transcripts of a Skype conversation between Sujan and another Ibacs director in Cardiff obtained by the FBI reveal that Sujan was the real brains behind ATG. Sujan came to the UK to study in 2003 and was followed by his wife, Akter, two years later.

They had a son, Amanul, in 2011 and lived in Pontypridd, but later moved to a rented townhouse in Cardiff, close to the Alexandra Gate business park. The couple briefly moved back to Bangladesh before travelling to Turkey with their son.

Ibacstel Electronics was dissolved in March 2016 and ATG was wound up eight months ago. Other Ibacs-linked firms continue to operate out of a new office in Newport but there is no suggestion that they are involved in any wrongdoing, the newspaper said.

The FBI disclosures will raise fears about the likelihood of further attacks in Europe.

"Google Android O: Top features, release date, device compatibility, and more","Android O: Here’s everything we need to know about the next version of Google’s mobile operating system. Android O: Here’s everything we need to know about the next version of Google’s mobile operating system.

Google is going to release the next version of Android, currently known as Android O, on August 21. The release date of Android O will coincide with the total solar eclipse. Google plans to have a live stream from New York, which will start at 2.40 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) which is around 12.10 AM for India. While the next version is known as Android O, but that’s not the name of the software. It’s been widely speculated that Android O will be officially called Oreo. Some even suggests that Google might call the next version of Android as Octopus. So yes, there’s still a lot of confusion about the final name.

At this year’s I/O talked a lot about Android O, so we already know a lot of features coming up in the final version. The new update will bring better battery life, enhanced security features, Picture in Picture (PiP) mode, improved notifications, better audio quality, and much more. Here’s everything you need to know about Android O.

Android O: Top confirmed features

Background limits

In the next version of Android, Google will be adding a new feature called background limits to extent battery life. This works as a power saving feature to limit background applications, which means the phone’s battery will last longer than it usual does.

Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode

The picture-in-picture mode will simply allow users to continue watching videos while working with other apps. So now you can watch a YouTube video while sending an important email to your boss.

Notification Dots

Android O will allow users to see notifications even if they’ve missed them without pulling the drop down menu from the top of the screen. It’ s basically a small dot that appears on the app icons when there is a new notification. It will only appear in case of an unread notification. Just long press on the unread notification and you’ll notice a pop-up bubble appears in the form of the notification. The feature looks similar to the red badges we’re familiar on Apple’s iOS.

Faster boot times

Google is promising faster boot times and apps loading times with Android O. So apps will runs and load faster, if you run Android O on a smartphone. Google has already made improvements to boot times in Android Nougat, but with Android O, it is making things faster and better.

New Emojis

The next version of Android will feature redesigned list of emojis. So in place of the emoji that were known as blob faces, you will getting more circular faces that what you get on iOS.

Android O: Release Date and Device compatibility

During this year’s I/O, Google said that Android O would be available “later this summer”. Logically, Google will release the next version of the Android before it brings the Pixel 2 to the market. Given the company’s previous track record, all Google-branded smartphones and tablets will get the latest Android system update. So far, Android O will come to the following devices: Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X,and Nexus 6P. The first smartphone to come pre-loaded with Android O would be none other than the Pixel 2, which we hope will be announced sometime in September.

All religions should be respected: Justice Bhandari,"“There should be a feeling of love among the people of the country, we should love each other. Every religion should be respected,” he said. “There should be a feeling of love among the people of the country, we should love each other. Every religion should be respected,” he said.

Justice Dalveer Bhandari, a judge at the International Court of Justice, said on Sunday that all religions should be respected and that there should be a feeling of mutual love and respect among the people. He also exhorted the people to help the government in the fields of education, health and environment protection, and urged the younger generation to work towards eliminating inequality in the country. “There should be a feeling of love among the people of the country, we should love each other. Every religion should be respected,” he said.

On the poor healthcare, he said, “We saw death of 60 children in Gorakhpur and there are many more hospitals in bad condition. Education and health are two major works of a government. We should also help in these fields apart from the works the government is doing.”

“We have everything, but only because of inequality we have huge difference in the living standards of our people. We all should work to reduce this gap,” the former Supreme Court judge said at the event organised by Bhartiya Sathi Sangthan in the capital.

Emphasising on the need for betterment of education sector, he said that the country has progressed a lot in the field of education, but a lot is left to be done. “There should be steps for stopping commercialisation of eduction,” he added. “If we compare our standard of education with that globally, we can see that there is not even a single university in the list of top 200 international universities. We have to work a lot to give international level of education,” he said.

Praising the work done by National Green Tribunal chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar, who was present at the event, Bhandari said Kumar has dedicated his past five years to protection of the environment. Exhorting the people to protect the nature, Kumar said, “Nature does not need us, we need nature. We (humans) don’t have a habit of giving back. We are not fulfilling our responsibility.”

No military solution in North Korea: Donald Trump’s aide Steve Bannon,"FILE – In this April 9, 2017, file photo, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon steps off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Md.

President Donald Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon said there’s no military solution to the threat posed by North Korea and its nuclear ambitions, despite the president’s recent pledge to answer further aggression with “fire and fury.” In an interview with The American Prospect posted online on Wednesday, Bannon told the liberal publication that the US is losing the economic race against China. He also spoke about purging his rivals from the Defense and State departments.

Bannon was also asked about the white supremacist movement, whose march on Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend led to deadly violence. He dismisses them as “losers,” “a fringe element” and “a collection of clowns.” The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “There’s no military solution (to North Korea’s nuclear threats), forget it,” Bannon said. “Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don’t die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don’t know what you’re talking about, there’s no military solution here, they got us.”

Trump tweeted earlier on Wednesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “made a very wise and well-reasoned decision” by backing down after heightening fears of nuclear conflict in a series of combative threats, including against the US territory of Guam. Bannon also outlined his push for the US to adopt a tougher stance on China trade, without waiting to see whether Beijing will help restrain Kim, as Trump has pressed China’s leader to do. Trump also has lamented US trade deficits with China. “The economic war with China is everything,” Bannon said.

“And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we’re five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we’ll never be able to recover.” A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said on Wednesday both sides have benefited from trade.

Asked about Bannon’s comments, Hua said at a regular new briefing, “There is no winner in a trade war. We hope the relevant people can refrain from dealing with a problem in the 21st century with a zero-sum mentality from the 19th or the 20th century.” Hua appealed for dialogue to “preserve the sound and steady growth of China-US relations.” Bannon was a key general election campaign adviser and has been a forceful but contentious presence in a divided White House.

The former leader of conservative Breitbart News, Bannon has drawn fire from some of Trump’s closest advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner. The president is under renewed pressure to fire Bannon, who has survived earlier rounds of having fallen out of favor with Trump.

Earlier this week, the president passed up an opportunity to offer a public vote of confidence in Bannon. Trump said he’s a “good person” and not a racist, adding that “we’ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.” The latest anti-Bannon campaign comes as Trump faces mounting criticism for insisting that white supremacist groups and those who opposed them were both at fault for deadly violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Trump weighing options for new South Asia strategy: White House,"President Donald Trump (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)

Donald Trump is weighing his options on formulating a new US strategy in South Asia with the focus on Afghanistan, the White House has said, after the President held a key meeting with his national security team. Trump would take a final decision on this at an appropriate time, the White House said, without divulging the details of the meeting during which Trump was briefed by his national security team.

“Important day spent at Camp David with our very talented Generals and military leaders. Many decisions made, including on Afghanistan,” Trump tweeted after the meeting at the presidential retreat at Camp David, a picturesque resort in Maryland. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the President was briefed extensively by his national security team on a new strategy to protect America’s interests in South Asia.

“The President is studying and considering his options and will make an announcement to the American people, to our allies and partners, and to the world at the appropriate time,” Sanders said in a statement after

Besides the National Security Adviser Lt Gen H R McMaster, the meeting was attended by Vice President Mike Pence, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Director of national Intelligence Daniel Coats, and President’s top Adviser on South Asia Lisa Curtis.

Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and US Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, attended the meeting through a secured video conference. The administration has said its Afghanistan strategy will be determined by a review of its approach to the broader region, including Pakistan and India. Meanwhile, Senator Lindsay Graham, in a statement, urged the US President not to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.

“If we were to pull all our troops from Afghanistan it would be a disaster for our national security interests and set the stage for another 9/11 on American soil,” Graham said. Graham hoped that Trump, unlike his predecessor, will not put US military in a bad spot in Afghanistan.

“He should give them the tools and support they need to confront the rising terror threats in Afghanistan. Today, our diplomatic efforts are non-existent in Afghanistan and the same is true in neighbouring Pakistan,” Graham said.

With the fourth leg of Pro Kabaddi season 5 being played in the Lucknow – ‘city of nawabs’, local boy Suresh Raina was in the house to support home team UP Yoddha. Raina and wife Priyanka Chaudhary were in attendance to cheer for their home team who were playing their second home game against Haryana Steelers.

Raina and Priyanka watched U Mumba play Telugu Titans in the first match of the night. Soon, one could see Priyanka enjoy some pataknis (take downs). Rahul Chaudhari led his side to their second win of the season to beat U Mumba 37-32.

“Really good to see that a local sport, played in villages of India, is now getting recognition in the entire world. It is also the first time that we have our own team and I hope our players make us proud. Local support is must and thus I’m here to cheer for our home team,” Raina said.

Known for his hard-hitting abilities, Raina said that the aggressive style and the physical strength of players are something that he really admires about the sport. “Hum (cricketers) patak nahi sakte. Cricket mein patakni honi chaiye,” Raina said when asked about what one thing he wants to see in cricket.

Raina is not the first cricketer to have come to support their favourite team. At the beginning of the season, former cricketers VVS Laxman and Sachin Tendulkar were in attendance. While Laxman was in attendance to cheer for the Titans, Tendulkar had come into support Tamil Thalaivas as the team owner.

UP Yoddha, who are one of the four new teams this season, are currently sitting at the second spot in Zone B with 19 points. However, they suffered a narrow defeat against U Mumba in their first home game.

Speaking of its specifications, Cool Play 6 sports a a 5.5-inch Full HD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. This is a unibody, metal-clad smartphone, which is powered by a an Octa-core Snapdragon 653 processor with Adreno 510 GPU. There’s 6GB RAM and 64GB storage on-board with support for expandable storage via microSD card. The smartphone is backed by a 4060mAh battery, which the company claims can last up to 252 hours on standby and up to 6 hours of extreme gaming. The phone also features a fingerprint scanner on the back.

Perhaps the biggest feature of the Coolpad Cool Play 6 will be a dual (13MP + 13MP) rear camera setup with dual LED flash. It is capable of shooting pictures in ‘bokeh’ mode as well. Other features include slow video, long exposure, mono photo, and more. The front camera is 8MP with beauty mode and a couple of photo filters to choose from while taking photos.

Coolpad Cool Play 6 supports a USB Type – C slot for charging. Dual stereo speakers are at the bottom and power button along with volume rocker keys are placed on the right.

Australian journeyman Jason Norris faltered a little on the back nine but ultimately held his nerve to secure the biggest payday of his career with a four-stroke victory at the Fiji International on Sunday.

The 44-year-old South Australian shot a final round five-under-par 67 at the Natadola Bay Golf Course to finish on 14-under for the $1.2 million tournament, which is co-sanctioned by the European, Asian and Australasian Tours.

Norris started a shot behind overnight leader Wade Ormsby but surged four clear of the field with six birdies and a single bogey before the turn.

Bogeys at the 10 and 15th were mitigated by a seventh birdie at the 13th and he parred the final three holes to finish with a comfortable cushion over compatriots James Marchesani and David McKenzie as well as Thai Jazz Janewattananond.

“It’s taken me 21 years to have a win like this,” Norris said after receiving the trophy from Fiji President George Konrote. “Now I’ve got a start in Europe and Asia as well. I was going to quit the game last year and now I’m playing all over the world. It’s just fantastic.”

Jazz Janewattananond stormed up the leaderboard with a flawless 64, the 21-year-old hitting six birdies and an eagle three at the par five 17 to claim a share of second with Marchesani (70) and McKenzie (67).

Canada’s Mike Weir finished with a 74 for a share of 35th, a shot better off than his fellow former U.S. Masters champions Angel Cabrera (74) and local Vijay Singh (71) who were among the players tied for 41st on one-under.

The actor wore a beautiful, breezy outfit with bright floral embroidery on it. We love how the designer added a touch of modern element to the look while retaining the feminine elegance with the ruffle work. It's kind of unusual to mix a corset top, shorts and a sheer dress together to create an outfit, but it's ace designer Ritu Kumar we are talking about. We thinks she pulled it off beautifully. The stylists did a brilliant job too by giving Patani lovely tousled hair and sun-kissed make-up. (Source: Express photo by Amit Chakravarty)

Colaba Causeway: Paradise for shoppers,"From souvenirs, clothes, jewellery, antiques, bags and footwear to first copies of expensive watches — those with an eye for cheap bargains are sure to find a steal. Nirmal Harindran From souvenirs, clothes, jewellery, antiques, bags and footwear to first copies of expensive watches — those with an eye for cheap bargains are sure to find a steal. Nirmal Harindran

A walk down Colaba Causeway will pack in almost everything a tourist would want to take back from Mumbai. Teeming with pocket-friendly street shops, restaurants and pubs, the causeway is a must for shoppers coming to the city. From souvenirs, clothes, jewellery, antiques, bags and footwear to first copies of expensive watches – those with an eye for cheap bargains are sure to find a steal.

A hop, skip and jump from the Gateway of India, Colaba Causeway has been popular with tourists for decades. The attractive prices have been drawing Mumbaikars as well. The cacophony of vendors wooing customers and the hubbub of people bargaining brings the market to life every day 10 am onwards.

While Middle Easterners are the most common tourists in the market, Europeans, Africans and Americans are not far behind.”I came across this place on the Internet. While it is difficult to converse with the shopkeepers, we know enough Hindi to quote the right price and get the best deals”, said Solene Bertaux from Spain.

For Rathath Sayeed from the UAE, the plethora of options for shoes, bags, and makeup is what brings her here every year. Moreover, she never forgets to take back goodies from the market for her friends back home.

The shopkeepers, through the years, have learned different ways to woo customers. From introducing pop music in the shops to communicating in multiple languages, they have done it all.

Bhavesh Kalapi, from Cotton Color, a garment shop, recalled an unusual incident. “A few years ago, a backpacker from Europe visited our shop. He was low on cash so he exchanged his bicycle for a few items from our shop. From then, we have allowed such kind of a barter system as well,” he said.

“I learned Arabic just to speak with the hundreds of tourists who come to my shop every year. They prefer embroidered or plain kurtas in silk and cotton. So we make sure to stock them up well in advance,” said Salim Merchant, the owner of Kanis Garment.

“I just type down the prices on my calculator and show it to the customers. It is up to their discretion to buy a garment or not,” he laughs.

With stories of cultural exchanges abound in every nook and corner of Colaba Causeway, some tourists claim that it is also tainted by episodes of cheating. “I refrain from buying from street shops because I have often been quoted higher prices,” rued Jamie Qaitz from Spain.

Although, Luis Pinar from Italy has a different opinion.”I feel the sellers here are extremely friendly and the products sold are worth the price,” he said.

"Mumbai University result declaration: CM Devendra Fadnavis, Governor C H Vidyasagar Rao review progress","A member of the Students’ Federation of India gets her head shaved in protest against the ‘educational policies of the government and the VC’ at Kalina Friday. Santosh Parab A member of the Students’ Federation of India gets her head shaved in protest against the ‘educational policies of the government and the VC’ at Kalina Friday. Santosh Parab

Maharashtra Governor C H Vidyasagar Rao and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis reviewed the progress of the declaration of Mumbai University (MU) results, which have been delayed. They emphasised that the results should be declared at the earliest and no student should suffer because of the delay.

According to a statement issued by Raj Bhavan, out of 477 results, MU has declared 354 results as on August 17; 123 results remain to be declared. Devanand Shinde, MU’s in-charge Vice Chancellor, said all efforts were being made for early declaration of results, the statement said.

“The Governor and the CM have directed the higher and technical education department, director, higher education, CET commissioner and vice chancellors of other universities in the state to take necessary steps to ensure the admission of students from Mumbai University pursuing higher education should be carried out without any hindrances,” it said.

Cut-off dates of several postgraduate courses have been extended for students’ convenience. The Governor has also told the higher education department to issue “suitable notification” to other universities in the state for provisional admissions of MU students.

Besides, it has also decided to direct all universities to postpone the dates of registration or allocate over and above quota to accommodate MU students, the statement said.

Education Minister Vinod Tawde said it would be suggested to the examination board of MU whether results of checked answersheets could be declared. “Almost 96 per cent assessment of all exams is completed and only four per cent is remaining,” said Tawde.

However, reiterating the demand of resignation of Tawde, Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray said a mental harassment complaint should be filed against him for troubling students and parents.

“I have sought an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue and will meet him soon,” he said.

(Source: AP) A woman and her child observe a memorial tribute to the victims of the terrorist attack on the historic street of Las Ramblas one day after the terrorist attack, in Barcelona. (Source: AP)

Hundreds of protesters descended on the streets of Barcelona just a day after a van plowed into people in the historic Las Ramblas area killing 14 and injuring over 100. The protests which turned violent saw members of anti-Islam La Flange group going against anti-fascist counter demonstrators. Blockades have been created by riot police in the area which had to intervene between the two factions to control the increasing violence.

La Flange came out on the streets, after Islamic State (IS) took responsibility for the attack. The group on its website said,”No one was fooled into thinking that the policies of multiculturalism and #RefugeesWelcome wouldn’t end like they did in Las Ramblas in Barcelona.”

Earlier on Thursday, Spain saw one of the deadliest terror attacks on its soil as a van plowed into people in historic Las Ramblas area. The attack in Catalonia carried out at around 5.30 pm (local time) left 14 dead and over 100 injured. Witnesses said the van kept pulling back and forth in order to hurt as many people as possible, also moving from side to side. The dead and injured are from over 34 countries, including France, Germany, Pakistan and the Philippines.

Taking responsibility for the attack in Barcelona IS’ media arm Amaq news agency issued a statement on Thursday saying, “The perpetrators of the Barcelona attack are soldiers of the Islamic State and carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting coalition states.” The terrorist organisation’s claims are yet to be verified.

Highlights:

8:50 am: A massive anti-terrorism operation is ongoing in Spain to hunt the perpetrators of the worst attack in the country’s recent history at Las Ramblas. The van drove for 500-600 meters in the Ramblas boulevard crowded by pedestrians, killing 13 on its way. Here is a map of the attack site.

8:40 am: Authorities believe that the terrorists had an intention of detonating a bigger bomb at he the centre of the market placing it in the van.

8:27 am: Authorities after taking a closer look at a blast site in town of Alcanar said that the terrorists had a much bigger attack in mind which was thwarted after they managed to create a flawed bomb which exploded blowing apart the house. The Spanish police now believes that the small house might be the incubator which was used to plan and execute the deadly attack on people in Las Ramblas.

8:17 am: Spanish authorities believe that the attack was carried by a cell of at least nine extremists who plotted to combine vehicles and explosives and meticulously carried out the plan at Las Ramblas in Barcelona, according to news agency AP.

8:14 am: After the devastating and gut wrenching experience on Thursday Barcelona once again stood up to extremism, with the Las Ramblas promenade quietly reopening to the public Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy along with King Felipe VI joined at the city’s main square to pay their respects to those who lost their lives in the deadly attack.

7:52 am: World leaders expressed their sympathies and condolences to the families of the victims of the attack. Former American President Barrack Obama in a tweet said, “Michelle and I are thinking of the victims and their families in Barcelona. Americans will always stand with our Spanish friends. Un abrazo.”

7:40 am: Taking precautionary measures after a series of vehicles attacks in last one year, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is all set to announce his plan to ensure safety of pedestrians in high-traffic areas from such attacks in the country. Turnbull called on the people to pray for the seven-year-old Australian boy who is still missing in Barcelona after being separated from his mother during the attack in Las Ramblas.

6:46 am: California resident Jared Tucker and his new bride had just sent joyful pictures from their first trip to Europe, a vacation they’d saved for to celebrate their one year anniversary. The last pictures arrived a day before tragedy struck. According to news agency Reuters, Tucker’s family in Northern California learned Friday that he was among those killed in the deadly truck attack a day earlier in Barcelona. He says the family is still in disbelief that the one American victim of the attack was him. His father, Dan Tucker, says he had not seen his son happier than he had been in the last year. He added that his only consolation is that 42-year-old Jared probably died happy.

5:00 am: The driver of the van that ploughed into crowds in Barcelona, killing 13 people, may still be alive and at large, Spanish police said in a statement issued on Friday, denying earlier reports that he had been shot dead in a Catalan seaside resort.

The police chief in Spain’s northeastern region of Catalonia, Josep Lluis Trapero, said he could not confirm the driver was one of five men killed. “It is still a possibility but, unlike four hours ago, it is losing weight,” he told regional TV.

3:30 am: Catalonia’s regional police identified the four suspects responsible for attacks in Spain, naming then as as Moussa Oukabir, 17, Said Aallaa, 18, and Mohamed Hychami, 24. Police said the search for a fourth suspect, Younes Abouyaaqoub, aged 22, is still underway.

Of the 12 people suspected of being involvement in the attacks, five were shot dead by security forces in Cambrils and another four have been arrested, said Josep Lluis Trapero of Catalonia’s police during a televised interview, on Friday. The three remaining suspects have been identified but have not been detained, he further added.

3:00 am: President Donald Trump spoke with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy over the phone, on Friday and pledged the full support of the United States in investigating the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils and bringing the perpetrators to justice, the White House said in a statement.

Trump also extended his condolences to the victims of the attacks and their families, the statement said.

La Liga begins with tributes to victims of Barcelona attacks,"A minute of silence was held before the match, and will also be observed ahead of all league games this weekend. (Source: La Liga Twitter) A minute of silence was held before the match, and will also be observed ahead of all league games this weekend. (Source: La Liga Twitter)

Leganes defeated Alaves 1-0 to get the Spanish league underway on Friday, after they paid tribute to the victims of the attacks in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils.

A minute of silence was held before the match, and will also be observed ahead of all league games this weekend. Valencia defeated 10-man Las Palmas in the late match thanks to a first-half goal by striker Simone Zaza.

Defending champion Real Madrid and Barcelona will play on Sunday, but both squads held a minute of silence before their training sessions on Friday.

Barcelona players will wear shirts worded with “Barcelona” instead of their names on the back when they host Real Betis at Camp Nou. The hashtag “TotsSomBarcelona” (We are all Barcelona) will be on the front of the shirts, following the attacks that killed 14 people and injured more than 120 others.

Titleholder Real Madrid will debut at Deportivo La Coruna without Cristiano Ronaldo, who is serving a suspension for shoving a referee in the Spanish Super Cup final which Madrid won. Atletico Madrid opens at promoted Girona on Saturday.

Gabriel scored the league’s first goal from close range after Alaves goalkeeper Fernando Pacheco partially stopped a free kick cross. Gabriel appeared to be offside, igniting criticism for the lack of video review in La Liga.

Alaves, which surprised as a promoted club last season by finishing ninth and reaching the Copa del Rey final, missed a chance to open the scoring when Manu Garcia missed a penalty kick less than 10 minutes before Gabriel’s first-half goal. Leganes made its top-flight debut last season.

Zaza, who was signed by Valencia after playing for the club on a loan from Juventus last season, scored the winner for the hosts at Mestalla Stadium with a well-placed left-footed shot from just outside the area in the 22nd minute.

Las Palmas played a man down from the 33rd after midfielder Alen Halilovic was sent off with a straight red card for a hard tackle on Jose Gaya.

Basketball’s shortest and fastest format comes to a mall near you,"Amjyot Singh has played the 3×3 version for the Japanese club Hamamatsu. (Source: File) Amjyot Singh has played the 3×3 version for the Japanese club Hamamatsu. (Source: File)

Some of the country’s top cagers will embrace basketball’s shortest and fastest format, the International Olympic Committee approved 3×3 format, which will debut at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, during a two-day tournament which will be held at a mall in Gurgaon next month. Boxing has gone to the audience with bouts hosted at malls in Noida and South Delhi and basketball’s crunched version — played on a half court with matches lasting 10 minutes — will try and woo weekend shopaholics with professional dunkers to be the added attraction to the main event.

The swanky Ambience Mall is where some of India’s stars, including Amjyot Singh and Inderbir Gill, will dabble in a format targeted to get the Millennials hooked. Titled the Road to Mexico — a precursor to the 3BL league which will take-off next year in India — the September 16-17 tournament will see eight international teams, including the Malaysian national team and and four Indian sides, in action. The winner will get an entry into the FIBA World Tour competition, which retains a cool quotient with street-side courts and courts set-up near shopping arcades.

For the mall-goers, the format may be novel but it has had its share of hotbeds in India – the YMCAs hosting and their teams leading the charge – and with the ‘Olympic sport’ tag now firmly attached, 3×3 courts and tournaments are expected to proliferate. Indian basketball’s current stars have already had a tryst with Tokyo-bound version of the sport with Amjyot having played at the highest level while representing World Tour runners-up Hamamatsu – a Japan-based club.

Rohit Bakshi, the Japan-based businessman, who is promoting the to -be-launched 3×3 league in India, confirmed that Amjyot will participate in the Road to Mexico tournament. Unlike the standard 5×5, this format requires just a half court and the matches stretch to just 10 minutes – down from the four-quarter 48-minute standard fare.

“In a standard game you need to go to a stadium and spend your time exclusively on the sport. But here, non-sports lovers will to stop and watch. This creates a whole new audience which is different from the club-supporting sports followers,” Bakshi said.

The 3×3 league will not run foul with the authorities as it has the blessing of the international basketball federation (FIBA). Bakshi co-owns Hamamatsu, the Japanese 3×3 Premier League champions, and the club’s global success with Indians in the mix prompted FIBA to rope him in an effort to tap one of the markets oozing with potential.

“We found a committed partner in India. We trust Rohit Bakshi and his commitment to the format, that favours people with shorter height and that is also something that the FIBA has kept in mind,” FIBA development manager Robert Reiblinger said. Indians Bikramjit Gilla, Inderbir Gill along with Amjyot won hearts back in Japan when they represented Hamamatsu and a similar sentiment in India, if the format takes off as expected, will revolutionize the sport.

“We have more than 150 countries who are actively participating in the World Tour and taking part in the international events. This number is expected to improve now that the sport is in the Olympics,” Reiblinger said.

Pakistani Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai will be studying in Oxford University. “So excited to go to Oxford!! Well done to all A-level students — the hardest year. Best wishes for life ahead!” Malala tweeted on Thursday, along with a screen shot of her acceptance into the prestigious university.

The 20-year-old will study philosophy, politics and economics. In March, Malala revealed she had received an offer to study the three subjects at a UK university on condition of achieving three As in her A-levels, the Telegraph reported. Malala was nearly killed by the Taliban in Pakistan for campaigning for girls’ rights to education in 2012. She became internationally known after the incident and relocated with her family to Birmingham for further rehabilitation. In 2014, at age 17, Malala became the youngest person to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and has since become a symbol for the fight for human rights and education.

In April, she became the youngest-ever UN Messenger of Peace. Notable Oxford alumni include Pakistan former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Myanmar’s pro-democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi as well as former British Prime Minister David Cameron and his one-time Labour opponent Ed Miliband.

Why cases go unreported: Outdated laws and tedious search for justice,"Legal experts, counsellors say IT Act has not kept pace with changing realities of social media (Representational) Legal experts, counsellors say IT Act has not kept pace with changing realities of social media (Representational)

The last time Ankur (name changed) was on Facebook was in 2013. It’s been four years since the incident, “when a few batchmates hacked my account and sent porn links and dirty messages to some girls from my class, who then complained against me”. Since then, he has avoided social media as it makes him “anxious”, and has been seeking therapy regularly. “My studies suffered… barring my parents and a teacher, no one believed me… My class teacher called me ganda ladka… For my batchmates, it was just fun, they didn’t realise they bullied me,” he said.

Ankur also had few options he could pursue. Cyber bullying, under the Information Technology Act, is not an offence. “The Act is outdated. It was last amended in 2008… Since then, social media has exploded in the country. The ground reality of 2017 is vastly different,” said advocate Pavan Duggal, who specialises in cyber law. Popular social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat, which entered the market only in 2010 and 2011, have also become avenues of bullying. Under-reporting of cases

According to DCP (Cyber Cell) Anyesh Roy, “only three cases involving children and cyberspace have been registered in the last two years”. Children, parents, teachers, child psychologists and cyber law experts The Sunday Express spoke to shed light on why so many cases go unreported. In 2014, Duggal’s law firm conducted a survey which revealed that “for every 500 instances of cyber crime, only 50 were reported to police and of those 50, an FIR was filed only in one case”. “Under-reporting is de facto in India. The first cyber crime conviction was in 2003. From then until now, the number of convictions have been very low. In a country of a billion-plus people, it’s a discouraging number,” Duggal said. The reasons for this are plenty: “People don’t want unnecessary media publicity; the current process is very slow; and there is low confidence in the ability of the system,” he added.

Counsellor Geetanjali Kumar said she has often suggested to parents to “report cases to police but they are hesitant for various reasons — from a lengthy process to the family’s izzat.” Kiran Kumar (43), whose daughter was a victim of cyber bullying, said, “We didn’t file a complaint because legal battles in India are so long drawn… my child is already harassed. If we involve police, it will take her much longer to heal. That’s a risk we don’t want to take.” Loopholes in law

According to UNICEF’s 2016 ‘Child Online Protection in India’ report, “The transnational nature of cyber crime calls for international cooperation”.“The US has often failed to share information vital to dealing with cyber crime. It denies access to data held by companies based in the US — such as Google, Facebook — on grounds that it would be in contravention of its laws,” the report stated, adding that “Indian laws like the Information Technology Act do not apply to US firms.”

In the report, advocate Karnika Seth said, “The extant Indian laws are not sufficient to prevent and combat cyber threats of cyber bullying, cyber stalking and sexual abuse involving sexting and child pornography that children are exposed to in a digital world.”

“Acts such as sexting and cyber bullying, which have been criminalised in other countries, are not as yet considered to be offences under Indian law,” she added. Until 2008, even child pornography was not an offence under the IT Act. When the Act was amended to include it, several offences were made bailable — which cyber law experts called a “historic blunder”. “Conviction rate goes down because it’s easy to delete incriminating evidence when out on bail,” Duggal explained.

"Citing Donald Trump’s remarks, entire president’s arts council quits","US President Donald Trump (File Photo) US President Donald Trump (File Photo)

Actor Kal Penn, artist Chuck Close and the entire membership of the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities have announced their resignation. A letter dated Friday, and signed by 16 of 17 committee members, cited the “false equivalence” of President Donald Trump’s comments about last weekend’s “Unite the Right” gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump has blamed “many sides” for the demonstrations that left an anti-racism activist dead.

The White House said Trump had already decided against renewing the advisory committee for budgetary reasons.

“Ignoring your hateful rhetoric would have made us complicit in your words and actions,” the letter reads. “Supremacy, discrimination, and vitriol are not American values. Your values are not American values. We must be better than this. We are better than this. If this is not clear to you, then we call on you to resign your office, too.”

The only member whose name did not appear was Broadway director George C. Wolfe. Representatives for Wolfe at Creative Arts Agency said Friday that he was also resigning and that his name would be added to the letter, which seemed to contain a hidden political message beyond the ones stated openly. The first initials of the letter’s six main paragraphs spell out “r-e-s-i-s-t.”

“Earlier this month it was decided that President Trump will not renew the executive order for the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities (PCAH), which expires later this year,” the White House said in a statement attributed to an unnamed spokesperson. “While the committee has done good work in the past, in its current form it simply is not a responsible way to spend American tax dollars.”

The statement said the committee “merely redirects funding” from federal cultural agencies that report directly to the president, Congress and taxpayers.

“These cultural agencies do tremendous work and they will continue to engage in these important projects,” the statement said.

Earlier this week, two business advisory councils were disbanded as members left in protest.

Friday’s exodus heightened the arts world’s contentious relationship with Trump. The president struggled to find entertainers, many of whom backed Hillary Clinton in 2016, to perform at his inaugural gala, and Kennedy Center honorees for lifetime achievement have already said they will not attend the White House reception in December.

As president, Trump has also recommended defunding the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities.

The arts and humanities committee was established in 1982 under President Ronald Reagan and, with the first lady serving as honorary chair, works with both government and private agencies in promoting the arts through such programs as Turnaround Arts and Save America’s Treasures. Others signing the resignation letter included Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jhumpa Lahiri; and Vicki Kennedy, widow of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. All were appointed by President Barack Obama.

Indian contingent miss World University Games Opening Ceremony,"Hosts India were among the nations which missed the opening ceremony at the 29th World University Games after the contingent was stuck amidst protest from senior citizens.

The opening ceremony was adversely affected by a protest by retired government employees against the ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s new legislation to slash 40 per cent of veterans’ pensions across the board starting next year.

Although the veterans are not against the staging of the Games, they gathered outside the venue just before the start of the opening ceremony, to grab eyeballs of the large media

contingent.

Their efforts bore fruit as most of the participating nations’ could not take part in the opening ceremony parade initially as they got stuck in their team buses because of police restrictions following the protests.

Barring the unfortunate incident, the opening ceremony, otherwise was near perfect in-front of 21,000 packed stadium.

But the organizers heaved a sigh of relief, when the police finally managed to clear the way for athletes of all competing nations to be part of the opening ceremony.

Smartly dressed in sky blue shirts, silver coloured trousers, blue blazers and red stripped ties, the mid-sized Indian contingent looked dapper once they reached the venue.

The 29th edition of Universiade as it is known, will witness the participation of over 11,000 athletes from more than 140 nations in 22 disciplines.

The Games will be played at 38 competition venues, which include two newly built stadiums (Taipei Tennis Center and Taipei Heping Basketball Gymnasium) from August 19 to 30.

The biggest draw of the games is certainly not any athlete but a coach. The legendary Carl Lewis, who is in Taiwan as the sprint coach for the United States University team.

Hosts Chinese Taipei fielded the biggest contingent with 368 athletes followed by Russia, USA and China, Argentina Canada among others.

Hosts Taiwan, a diplomatically isolated island nation, which is forced to compete as Chinese Taipei in international sporting events, and India were among the affected countries

was also forced to miss the parade, in which only 20 nations took part initially.

The focal point of the ceremony presented an interpretation of Taiwan’s past, present and future. The entire programme was divided into three chapters based on the themes of nature, city and technology.

The first chapter – “Vibrant Island” focused Taiwan’s diverse and colourful local culture, while “Hybrid Taipei” highlighted the taste, smell and friendliness of the city which engages in a dialogue between the traditional and contemporary.

“Global Tribe”, the last chapter, showcased the country’s foray into the digital era.

The Opening Ceremony’s cultural performance presented the story of Taiwan, the lifestyle of urban and country lives, and the imagination of future trend from young artists’

perspectives.

A video message wishing good luck to the organizers and athletes from International Olympic Association (IOA) President Thomas Bach was also played at the stadium screen

during the ceremony.

The Universiade was officially declared open by Taiwan President Ing-wen.

The three-hour long ceremony culminated with an eye- catching acrobatic performances by small children, musical performances followed by a dazzling firework show.

The Universiade, is held every alternate year and is considered second only to the Olympics. It is a multi-sport event organised under the governance of International University of Sports Federation (FISU). The previous summer event was held in Gwangju in South Korea in 2015.

Steven Mnuchin tells Yale classmates: Donald Trump does not equate neo-Nazis with peaceful protesters,"President Donald Trump answers questions about his responses to the violence, injuries and deaths at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville as he talks to the media with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. (Source: Reuters) President Donald Trump answers questions about his responses to the violence, injuries and deaths at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville as he talks to the media with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. (Source: Reuters)

Urged by his Yale University classmates to resign as treasury secretary following President Donald Trump’s response to a white nationalist protest, Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday he would stay in office and that Trump “in no way, shape or form” equates neo-Nazis with peaceful protesters. Mnuchin, along with other members of the cabinet, stood beside the president at a Tuesday news conference as Trump blamed violence in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend on not just white nationalist rally organizers but also counter-protesters, and said there were “very fine people” among both groups.

A letter, dated Aug. 18 and signed by more than 350 members of the Yale class of 1985, argued it was Mnuchin’s “moral obligation to resign” immediately because, it said, Trump had “declared himself a sympathizer with groups whose values are antithetical to those values we consider fundamental to our sacred honor as Americans. “We know you are better than this, and we are counting on you to do the right thing,” the letter said.

Mnuchin issued a statement on Saturday responding to his classmates and what he said were many other comments urging him to “speak out.”

“I strongly condemn the actions of those filled with hate and with the intent to harm others,” he said. “They have no defense from me nor do they have any defense from the president or this administration.” Mnuchin, who is Jewish, added: “While I find it hard to believe I should have to defend myself on this, or the president, I feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way, shape or form, believes that neo-Nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways.”

Ultimately, he said, his classmates should be comforted by his remaining in the administration. “I don’t believe the allegations against the president are accurate, and I believe that having highly talented men and women in our country surrounding the president in his administration should be reassuring to you and all the American people,” he said. In his statement, he also noted the policy priorities he hopes to achieve in office, including tax reform, economic growth, and stopping terrorist financing.

Egypt’s first bitcoin exchange to begin trading this month,"“We’re still waiting on the Egyptian government to set some kind of regulations…Without any laws, bitcoin is not legal money in Egypt,” said Bitcoin Egypt founder Rami Khalil. “We’re still waiting on the Egyptian government to set some kind of regulations…Without any laws, bitcoin is not legal money in Egypt,” said Bitcoin Egypt founder Rami Khalil.

* Exchange will allow trade in Egyptian pounds * Bitcoin value has surged in recent months * Egypt has not yet regulated digital currency

Egypt’s first bitcoin exchange will go live later this month, the founders of Bitcoin Egypt said, linking the Middle East’s most populous country with a cryptocurrency that has surged in value in recent months.

Many governments around the world are still mulling how to regulate and classify bitcoin, a volatile digital currency that has captured the interest of speculative investors worldwide as its value has soared, roughly quadrupling since the start of 2017 and trading at around $4,400 on Thursday.

Egypt, most of whose 93 million people have no bank accounts but where electronic payments have grown in recent years, lacks regulations for digital currency. This means local retailers cannot accept it as payment but users on an exchange may be left to trade freely, potentially cashing in on its ascent.

“We’re still waiting on the Egyptian government to set some kind of regulations…Without any laws, bitcoin is not legal money in Egypt,” said Bitcoin Egypt founder Rami Khalil.

He said the exchange has picked up about 300 pre-registrations from users ahead of its launch.

The Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority, the country’s financial markets regulator, did not respond to requests for comment. Khalil and co-founder Omar Abdelrasoul see their platform connecting a community of several thousand bitcoin enthusiasts who will for the first time be able to trade in Egyptian pounds, which have roughly halved in value since November after flotation under an International Monetary Fund loan programme.

“Cryptoassets are happening whether (the Egyptian government) joins in or not. And by not joining they’re missing out on a very big market. Currently bitcoin is about a $70 billion market,” said Khalil.

Cryptocurrencies allow anonymous peer-to-peer transactions between individual users, without the need for banks or central banks.

Bitcoin’s lack of central authority makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls. This has helped it proliferate in China, the world’s most active bitcoin market, but has led some governments to crack down on its use to prevent money laundering.

Those same dynamics could propel bitcoin in Egypt, where a shortage of hard currency after the 2011 uprising sharply restricted bank transfers. Though liquidity at banks has improved and capital controls have been lifted in recent months, businesses still resort to a black market for dollars to obtain currency not available in the formal banking system.

“We’re trying to get people used to the idea of bitcoin, to ready the market so that in a couple of years we will reach a greater number of users. But for now we are trying to let people know what cryptocurrency is,” said Abdelrasoul.

Indian cricket team’s mantra: Shape up or ship out,"India take on Sri Lanka in the first of the five One-day Internationals on Sunday. (Source: AP) India take on Sri Lanka in the first of the five One-day Internationals on Sunday. (Source: AP)

Before India’s practice session in Dambulla on Friday, the team had a meeting on the fitness issue that lasted for about an hour. The whole squad had been apprised of the team management’s demand during the meeting. Both the team management and chief selector MSK Prasad are now in sync with the required fitness standards. It is, in fact, believed to be one of the chief reasons for Yuvraj Singh’s ouster. The aim is to become the top fielding side going into the 2019 World Cup. “First of all, talking about fitness, I think it’s really important for all of us to be fit. We spoke a lot about this. We had a meeting today. Everyone is really happy with this. From the senior-most guy like MS Dhoni to the youngest guy like Kuldeep (Yadav), we all agreed to this point,” said Manish Pandey at the press conference on Friday.

For players such as Pandey, who are electric on the field, it’s a happy situation. Because of their fielding, they feel more confident about their batting or bowling. However, in this Indian team, there’s no scope for complacency — only for improvement. The 27-year-old Karnataka batsman is coming back to the Indian team after suffering an injury (side strain) during the IPL. So he wants to work harder. “I should never be satisfied with this,” he said.

Maybe, to lead by example, captain Virat Kohli, alongside KL Rahul, had an intense fitness drill before the net session today. In fact, every player has his own fitness training which is followed throughout the year. For someone like Rahul, who is prone to injuries and is returning to the ODI squad after a gap of seven months, the emphasis is on getting fitter, minimising the risks of injuries. As Pandey put it: “It’s not only the cricket we play but also about the fitness and the tests we have at least twice a year. We all prepare for that as well.”

A lengthy home Test season (13 Tests in six months) last term saw India play only eight ODIs in the lead-up to the Champions Trophy in June this year. New Zealand stretched them before losing the five match-series 3-2. India then beat England 2-1. Going into the Champions Trophy, the fitness aspect had been hardly mentioned. Kedar Jadhav, one of the weak links in terms of fielding, bagged six wickets against New Zealand at an economy rate of 4.05. Then, he scored 232 runs in three matches against England.

Jasprit Bumrah, another one low on fielding reliability quotient, took 11 wickets in those two series and rapidly grew into a death-overs specialist. Yuvraj hammered a match-winning 127-ball 150 against England at Cuttack. The 180-run hiding against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy final seems to have ushered in a different outlook towards team fitness and fielding. “After the Champions Trophy, we felt that we need to be a fitter and a stronger side, we felt that we need to raise our fitness levels. We are trying to fix some fitness parameters and whoever it is has to strictly adhere to those parameters. We have two to three phases in those parameters leading up to the 2019 World Cup and if someone fails to match to those parameters, he will not be considered irrespective of whoever it is,” chief selector MSK Prasad had said a few days ago.

Fitness vs skill

Fitness versus skill is an ongoing debate in modern cricket that thrives in limited-overs excesses. Former India captain Bishan Bedi had brought in a strict fitness regime, when he became the cricket manager in 1990. But eventually cost him the job. Bedi confessed that he did overdo the fitness part at times but it was basically meant for the reserves. He, however, felt that with regard to choosing between a match-winning batsman/bowler and a brilliant fielder, there could never be any dilemma.

“If you have to pick between a match-winning batsman or a bowler, and a super fielder, I don’t think you can be caught in a dilemma. At the end of the day, cricket matches across formats are still decided by the numbers of runs scored or wickets taken. See, nobody talked about the fitness part before the Champions Trophy final,” he told The Indian Express, adding: “(But) it’s up to the (present) team management to decide what is more important; outstanding fielders or match-winners with the bat or ball. So far this Indian team hasn’t been stretched at all.”

At the same time, Bedi criticised Prasad for ‘sugar-coating’ Yuvraj’s omission. “How can the chairman of the selection committee be scared of saying that Yuvraj was dropped? Why are you hiding behind the truth? It’s a selection committee which has to pick the best. So in the process if somebody gets dropped, so be it. Be brave. All good things must come to an end. Let’s accept it. Nobody is getting any younger,” he said.

Another former India captain preferred to read between lines. “If the team management wants to go to the 2019 World Cup with India being the best fielding side in the world, fair enough. But I think they are saying this (extra emphasis on fitness) to justify Yuvraj’s exclusion. I think it’s the end of the road for him (in international cricket). I see Dhoni also going in a few months. They (team management and selectors) have their viewpoints. I see things differently. I have my own perspective. If fitness/fielding supersedes skill, match-winning abilities with the bat or ball, then Sachin Tendulkar should have never played for India,” he said on condition of anonymity.

"17,000 displaced returned to Mosul in past two months: Iraq","Displaced Iraqis from Talafar are seen in Salamya camp, east of Mosul, Iraq August 6, 2017. Picture taken August 6, 2017.

A total of 17,000 Iraqi displaced people have returned to their homes in the eastern part of Mosul in the past two months, government officials said. Iraq’s Minister of Displacement and Migration Jassim al-Jaaf said on Saturday that some 17,000 people returned to their homes in the districts of al-Hamdaniya, Bashiqa, Bartella and Nimrud, all east of Mosul, Efe news agency reported.

“Most of the basic services have been restored in the eastern part of Mosul, where 90 per cent of the neighbourhoods already have electricity, compared with only 30 to 40 per cent of areas in the western part,” Hussam al-Din al-Abar, a council member of Nineveh, said.

Al-Jaaf pointed out that although such figures of IDPs returning to Mosul were not very significant compared with those who were forced to leave their homes; it was a “good start” to encourage the ministry to offer aid to increase the number of citizens returning home.

The International Organization for Migration said on July 14 that clashes between the armed forces and extremists forced more than one million people to flee their homes during the nearly nine-month offensive, which led to liberating the Iraqi city in July. A large number of IDPs, who fled fighting in the western part of Mosul, are currently in the eastern sector of the Iraqi city, which was the main bastion of the Islamic State terrorist group in the Arab county since June 2014.

Scholars say Donald Trump went afoul in lumping Robert E Lee with founders,"Activists gather around the Confederate Army Gen. Robert E.

Lee was vilified during the Civil War only to become a heroic symbol of “The Lost Cause” and eventually a racist icon. (AP Photo)

Both were great generals. Both Virginians. Both came from slave-owning plantation families. Is it really so far-fetched to put Robert E. Lee in the same category as George Washington, as President Donald Trump suggested Tuesday?

Many historians say yes.

” It’s a ridiculous conflation,” said Professor Alice Fahs of the University of California, Irvine. “He’s not a founding father, and it’s as though Trump thinks he is. It’s really astonishing. It’s amazing.”

Trump’s remarks on Tuesday came as he was defending those who have sought to preserve the statue of Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, the focus of a violent weekend clash in which an anti-racist protester was killed. The president didn’t exactly equate the Confederate general with the nation’s founding fathers. But he noted a similarity sometimes glossed over _ ownership of slaves by figures who nobly stand or sit astride horses on U.S. pedestals _ and he asked: If you’re going to be pulling down statues, “where does it stop?”

“So, this week it’s Robert E. Lee,” he said. “I wonder, is it George Washington next week, and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?”

There is no notable movement to tear down the Washington monument. Most historians are in agreement that Washington and Jefferson’s ownership of slaves has tainted the positive legacy they left. And some monuments and memorials to both men attempt to address that part of their lives.

For some, monuments to those founding fathers “force us to contemplate the centrality of slavery to the making of the nation,” said Gregory Downs, a history professor at the University of California, Davis who studies the impact of the Civil War on the United States. But he also said the difference between the nation’s first president, George Washington, and then man who sought to secede from the nation, Robert E. Lee, isn’t complicated.

“It is obvious that traitors in arms to the nation are not equivalent to those who created it,” he said.

Adding to the complexity of the debate, many Lee memorials were erected long after the Civil War as part of an effort to rehabilitate Lee’s reputation and denigrate his victorious opponent Ulysses S. Grant, who fought to preserve the nation and later defended black civil rights as president.

In that sense the memorials “celebrated two historical crimes,” Downs said. “First, treasonous secession for the purpose of preserving and expanding slavery forever. Second, the violent and fraudulent creation of Jim Crow segregation.”

Associate Professor Michael Green of the University of Nevada Las Vegas added, “A lot of Southerners glorified Lee into something more than he was.” Lee has been portrayed as kindly to slaves, which he was not, and conflicted about which side to fight for, which is inaccurate, Green said.

He concedes, however, that if “my ancestors had fought for the Confederacy, it’s possible I would feel a little differently. It’s important to look at historical figures so that we don’t look up at them or down on them, but from all angles.”

He said that historical consensus is very different now than when Trump learned it in school decades ago. People like Lee were presented as heroes and people like Frederick Douglass, about whom the president seemed to have little knowledge earlier this year, weren’t presented at all.

Lee and Washington in the same class? Said Downs: “Had the Confederacy won, a new nation founded on perpetuating slavery would have celebrated Robert E. Lee as its George Washington. Luckily for us, that effort failed.”

"Vietnam battles dengue outbreak, over 90 thousand affected","Doctor Vu Minh Dien, left, examines dengue patient Tran Thi Xuyen at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi, Vietnam on Friday, Aug. 18, 2017. (AP Photo) Doctor Vu Minh Dien, left, examines dengue patient Tran Thi Xuyen at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi, Vietnam on Friday, Aug. 18, 2017. (AP Photo)

Vietnam has been battling raging dengue fever outbreaks with more than 10,000 new infections reported over the past week stretching its medical system. The number of admitted patients represents a 42-percent increase over the same period last year along with seven more deaths, the Ministry of Health said Friday. A total of 90,626 people have been infected, of whom 76,848 are hospitalised and 24 have died. The ministry attributed the rise of dengue outbreaks to higher temperature, more rains and rapid urbanization that promote the breeding of virus-carrying mosquitoes.

Dr. Vu Minh Dien of the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi, where the most severe cases were being treated, said that 800-1,000 people have been checking in daily complaining of fever. That compares to only several cases that reported to the hospital in June and July last year, he said. Dien said some 300 dengue patients were being treated, stretching the hospital’s resources, including longer working hours without weekend leaves.

Tran Thi Xuyen, a fruit and vegetable seller in a small market in Son La province, said she did not know how she contracted dengue fever, which also infected her fellow saleswoman. “I took anti-biotics prescribed by the local district hospital for four days, but the fever did not go away and I admitted myself to this hospital where doctors said I had dengue fever,” she said from her hospital bed.

There is no cure for any of the four strains of the mosquito-borne virus that causes high fever, exhaustion and in some cases a vicious skin rash. Patients most at risk of dying are the elderly, children or those with other medical complications. Hanoi and the southern commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City are the hardest hit.

The government yesterday urged residents to actively engage in killing mosquitoes and mosquito larvae, particularly at construction sites and housing for workers.

“The joint efforts by the people as well as our political system in searching and eliminating mosquito larvae, emptying water containers, which are fertile for larvae to breed, and spraying chemicals to kill mosquitoes are key factors to curb dengue fever,” Dien said.

Viswanathan Anand joint eighth after another bad day in St. Louis,"Viswanathan Anand had another bad outing, drawing seven and losing two games. (Source: File) Viswanathan Anand had another bad outing, drawing seven and losing two games. (Source: File)

Former World Champion Viswanathan Anand had another bad outing, drawing seven and losing two games, to remain on joint 8th place after the end of nine rounds of blitz in the St. Louis Rapid and blitz chess tournament here.

Having garnered just seven points out of a possible eighteen in the rapid section, Anand needed a big breakthrough in the blitz tournament spanning over 18-rounds but he was not in his best shape to make a mark.

Losing a clear better position against tournament leader Levon Aronian of Armenia and a forced drawn position to Sergey Karjakin of Russia, Anand drew the remaining seven to reach just 10.5 points and now the podium is out of his reach.

Aronian, meanwhile, continued with his good run and scored 6.5/9 in the blitz games to lead the tables by a two-point margin now over Hikaru Nakamura of United States who is on 16.5 points.

The blitz belonged to Karjakin who scored a massive 8/9 winning seven and drawing just two games in the day. Lucky on some occasions, Karjakin jumped to sole third spot on 16 points and another similar outing on the final might even seehim at the top of the tables.

The euphoria surrounding Garry Kasparov’s comeback just doesn’t seem to subside. The 13th World champion who ruled the chess board for about 20 years till his retirement in 2005, also scored 3.5/9 like Anand with the difference being his three losses and one win against Anand’s no wins.

The mutual encounter between the two was a treat for the chess-buffs as it saw a few ups and downs before the game was drawn. This was the second draw in a row after the two had split the point in the rapid section too. It may be recalled that Anand had lost a World championship match against Kasparov in 1995.

Anand and Kasparov are by far the oldest two players in the 150000 USD prize money event and both would like to finish on a positive note. The final day will again see nine rounds of excitement when all ten players play another round of blitz with colours reversed.

Standings after 18 rounds: 1. Levon Aronian (Arm, 18.5); 2. Hikaru Nakamura (Usa, 16.5); 3. Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 16); 4. Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus, 15); 5. Fabiano Caruana (Usa,14.5); 6-7. Le Quang Leim (Vie), Lenier Dominguez (Cub) 12 each; 8-9. V Anand (ind), Garry Kasparov (Rus) 10.5 each; 10. David Navara (Cze, 9.5).

India trounce Sri Lanka to keep domination going: How Twitterati reacted,"Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli took India cruising past the winning line. (Source: PTI) Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli took India cruising past the winning line. (Source: PTI)

India came into the ODI series against Sri Lanka with momentum firmly on their side. They had reached the final of the ICC Champions Trophy, beaten West Indies 3-1 in the Caribbean and had swept aside Sri Lanka in the Test series 3-0. India were doing exceptionally well with the ball, bat and in the field. Such as the dominance that it allowed India to rest some key members. And the first ODI, once again, showed why. The visitors posted a 9 wicket win in an all round show.

Buoyed by Shikhar Dhawan’s unbeaten 132 and equally valuable unbeaten 82 by Virat Kohli, India chased down Sri Lanka’s modest total of 216 runs to pick up the first win of the five-match-series and once again stamp their authority on what has been an extremely one sided series. Rohit Sharma was the only wicket to fall when the Mumbai batsman unluckily lost his bat and had his foot in the air as he ran inside the crease.

Earlier, Sri Lanka started well courtesy Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka with the latter producing some courageous hits. Dickwella and Kusal Mendis took up the service next but the hosts were undone by the Indian spinners. Such was their downfall that Sri Lanka went from 139/1 at one stage to be bowled out for 216.

At this rate Shikhar ‘बेफ़िक्र’ Dhawan will need an extra bag and excess baggage allowance for the return trip…too many 🏆

"Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia eye medal at World Wrestling Championships","Sakshi Malik would be hoping to do one better when she takes on the mat on Thursday in the women’s wrestling competition. (Source: File) Sakshi Malik would be hoping to do one better when she takes on the mat on Thursday in the women’s wrestling competition. (Source: File)

With their eyes firmly trained on winning medals, Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik and Asian champion Bajrang Punia will spearhead the Indian challenge at the World Wrestling Championships, starting here tomorrow.

All eyes would be on Rio Games bronze-winner in 58kg, Sakshi, who bagged a silver medal at the Asian Championship in May after climbing up a division to 60kg category.

Having qualified in the same category for this championships, Sakshi would be hoping to do one better when she takes on the mat on Thursday in the women’s wrestling competition.

Vinesh Phogat, another silver medallist at the Asian Championship, will also fancy her chances in women’s 48kg. Although Vinesh had won the Asian Championship silver in 55kg after making a comeback from an injury she had suffered during the Rio Games, the 22-year-old is back in her preferred 48kg category.

Besides Vinesh, none of the other Phogat sisters are part of the World Championship as two of the most famous — Geeta and Babita — didn’t even participate in the trials, while the younger ones — Ritu and Sangeeta — failed to qualify.

Meanwhile, in men’s freestyle, bronze medallist of the 2013 Budapest edition, Bajrang would be eyeing a gold this time around with his confidence high after finishing on top of the podium at the Asian Championship.

Bajrang, who had bagged a bronze at Budapest in 60kg freestyle, has now climbed up a division to 65kg. However, he looked pretty comfortable in his new weight division as he fought Asia’s best wrestlers in this category a few months ago to emerge victorious.

Although he ensured a berth at the World Championship just about 10 days ago, Bajrang proved far superior when he thrashed Rahul Mann 10-0 at a special selection trial held here on August 12.

Earlier, Mann had emerged the winner in 65kg during the selection trials held in Sonepat last month, but Bajrang submitted an application to the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), communicating his inability to take part in the trials due to viral fever and requesting that the final trials in his weight category be held after his recovery.

However, when Bajrang recovered, Mann suffered a minor neck injury and the trial could not be held. Subsequently, on the request of the chief coach Jagminder Singh, both the wrestlers travelled to France and the final trial took place before the tournament.

Besides Bajrang, India will pin hopes on Olympian Sandeep Tomar in 57kg as he has performed consistently in the last couple of years. A medal at the World Championship is something that Sandeep would want to see against his name.

Among other freestyle wrestlers, Amit Dhankar (70kg), Praveen Rana (74kg) and Satywart Kadiyan (97kg), who will be conferred with the Arjuna Award after this championships, are also expected to bring in laurels for the country.

The Greco-Roman contest will take place on the first two days of the competition and India will be fielding an eight-member team.

Although Greco-Roman has not been India’s strong point, the country would be hoping for a couple of them to spring a surprise or two.

Squad:

Men’s Freestyle: Sandeep Tomar (57kg), Harphool (61kg), Bajrang Punia (65kg), Amit Dhankar (70kg), Praveen Rana (74kg), Deepak (86kg), Satywart Kadiyan (97kg), Sumit (125kg).

Women’s wrestling: Vinesh Phogat (48kg), Sheetal (53kg), Lalita (55kg), Pooja Dhanda (58kg), Sakshi Malik (60kg), Shilpi (63kg), Navjot Kaur (69kg), Pooja (75kg).

Greco-Roman: Gyanender (59kg), Ravinder (66kg), Yogesh (71kg), Gurpreet Singh (75kg), Harpreet Singh (80kg), Ravinder Khatri (85kg), Hardeep (98kg), Naveen (130kg).

Picture taken July 26, 2017. REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki

Syria’s army and its allies have encircled an Islamic State (IS) pocket in central Syria after a series of advances in the desert region, state media, a Hezbollah military media unit and a war monitor said on Friday. President Bashar al-Assad’s military has advanced against Islamic State along two prongs towards Deir al-Zor province this year, leaving a large jihadist salient stretching back west between them.

Its forces have now cut off part of that salient with a pincer movement, enclosing a large Islamic State enclave around the village of Uqairabat, the state news agency SANA reported. The military media unit run by Hezbollah, a well-armed Lebanese ally of Assad in his more than six-year-old war with rebels and militants, said army units pushing southwards from Ithriya and northwards from Jebel Shaer had joined up.

Uqairabat is 37 km (23 miles) east of the town of al-Salamiya, near the only road through government territory to Aleppo, a route that has sometimes been closed because of fighting. Driving Islamic State militants out of that pocket would reduce pressure on the road. The army has also made advances further east in recent days that could cut off more of the IS salient, according to the war monitor, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Islamic State is on the back foot in Syria, where Kurdish and Arab militias backed by a US-led coalition have captured swathes of its territory in the north and are assaulting its former Syrian “capital” of Raqqa. The jihadist group is now falling back deeper into the Euphrates valley region of eastern Syria.

Live-ins are type of social terrorism: Rights panel chief,"Studies have shown that single people find dissimilar people more attractive while those in relationships look for those similar to them. (Photo: Thinkstock Images) Studies have shown that single people find dissimilar people more attractive while those in relationships look for those similar to them. (Photo: Thinkstock Images)

JUSTICE PRAKASH Tatia, chairperson of the Rajasthan Human Rights Commission, has described live-in relationships as “social terrorism” and argued that such ties need regulation and safeguards for better protection of women. He also said that while the country has been debating triple talaq, live-in relationships were more detrimental to women’s rights.

Asked what he meant by “social terrorism”, Justice Tatia told The Indian Express, “The area where they (a couple) live-in…there is a sense of insecurity. A neighbour thinks, whether my daughter or son goes there (to the couple’s house). There is a sense of fear, which virtually creates terror…there may be fights. I am not saying the people who are fighting are right but it’s the reality.”

Justice Tatia was elevated as a judge of the Rajasthan High Court in 2001. In September 2011, he took oath as Chief Justice of the Jharkhand High Court. In 2015, he was appointed as the chairperson of the Rajasthan Human Rights Commission, a post that had been lying vacant since 2010. In February this year, he issued an order seeking popular opinion on live-in relationships, in order to generate a report and make recommendations to the government.

According to him, live-in relationships have a detrimental effect on the institutions of family, and that children born of such relationships are not accepted by society. “What is the effect on family…on one’s daughter of a marriageable age? On the son? If we ignore all this, we are individuals…we have no right to say we live in society or with dignity because we are not relevant for others and others are not relevant for us…they (couples living in) live outside society,” he said.

Justice Tatia, however, said that he was not making a case for live-in relationships to be outlawed, but to be regulated in order to ensure safeguards for women and children. “What is the status of their children? We have to bear in mind that society has yet to accept live-in relationships…such children are not accepted in schools or in society,” he said.

“What is the foundation of live-in? If they have clarity that we will live together and there is continuity and they will be faithful, then what’s wrong with marriage? They need not follow any religious practice…there is court marriage, too,” he said.

“But you don’t want to do all this…(leaving) doubts in everyone’s mind that one can leave anytime. If they marry, there is some social security…(but in live-in) there is every chance that after some time, one person leaves and it could ruin the future of the other, normally it’s the lady…there is no registration, no divorce,” he said.

“Today, we say triple talaq is atrocious to women. But in this case (live-in), you don’t even need to say a single word…the man just leaves the woman and moves in with another woman. A live-in relationship is a pact between two persons…if it has no implication for the family, society, or where they live, etc., then how can we say it’s a dignified life and how can it be a society?” he said.

Justice Tatia said that those who defend live-in relationships say it’s a decision made by two consenting adults and that similar problems arise in marriages, too, but added that the reasoning was flawed.

“The question is whether it’s a better alternative to marriage? What is the control of society…who will intervene when things go wrong?” he said. Asked about the order he issued in February on behalf of the rights commission, Justice Tatia said, “I invited public opinion, written and even anonymous… Because Supreme Court says live-in must be known to society, it cannot be hidden. I could be a hundred percent wrong…that is why I have sought views from the public.”

US President Donald Trump reviewed an array of options for a strategy on Afghanistan with his top national security aides, but made no decision on whether he would commit more troops to America’s longest war. Friday’s meeting was the latest in a series of high-level discussions on Afghanistan and a broader security strategy for the South Asia region that has been bogged down by internal differences. Trump was briefed extensively “on a new strategy to protect America’s interests in South Asia”, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters, after the meeting at the Camp David Maryland retreat.

“The president is studying and considering his options and will make an announcement to the American people, to our allies and partners, and to the world at the appropriate time,” Sanders said. National security adviser H.R. McMaster and other top national security officials went into the meeting backing a modest increase in troops. At a mid-July meeting, they had thrown their weight behind 3,000 to 5,000 additional U.S. and coalition soldiers. “Anti-globalists,” who were led by Steve Bannon before he was fired on Friday as Trump’s chief strategist, backed withdrawing U.S. forces, U.S. officials said. Other options which were to be discussed included keeping the status quo of some 8,400 U.S. troops, a modest hike, or a small reduction that would focus on counter-terrorism operations enhanced by drone strikes and intelligence-gathering, they said.

A U.S. official said that during a trip to Afghanistan earlier this year, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told Afghan President Ashraf Ghani that the United States would have a sustained commitment to Afghanistan. More than 15 years since the United States invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Islamist Taliban government for giving al Qaeda a sanctuary where it plotted the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, there is no sign to an end in fighting. U.S. intelligence agencies assessed in May that the conditions in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through next year, even with a modest increase in military assistance from America and its allies. Senator Lindsey Graham, a senior Republican and advocate of a stronger U.S. role in Afghanistan, urged Trump in a statement to “listen to his generals. At the end of the day, Afghanistan is about American homeland security – not building empires.”

PAKISTAN FACTOR

The Camp David discussions have also been complicated by differences over taking a harder line on Pakistan for failing to close Afghan Taliban sanctuaries and arrest Afghan extremist leaders. U.S. officials say the Afghan Taliban are supported by elements of Pakistan’s military and top intelligence agency, a charge Islamabad denies. Under one proposal, the United States would begin a review of whether to designate Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism unless it pursues senior leaders of the Afghan Taliban and the allied Haqqani network, considered the most lethal Afghan extremist group, U.S. officials said.

Such a designation would trigger harsh U.S. sanctions, including a ban on arms sales and an end to U.S. economic assistance. Finalizing a regional security strategy has been held up by Trump’s frustration with a lack of options for defeating the Taliban and ending the longest foreign conflict in U.S. history. At the meeting in mid-July, Trump said Mattis and Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, should consider firing Army General John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, for not winning the war.

The delay for a decision left an opening for Erik Prince, the founder of the former Blackwater military contracting firm and the brother of Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, to propose replacing U.S. forces in Afghanistan with mercenaries. The plan made its way into the White House, according to a senior administration official. There is no indication, however, that the proposal – promoted by Prince in media interviews – garnered serious attention and it was not among the options prepared for consideration at Camp David, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

McMaster, Mattis, Dunford and retired Marine General John Kelly, the president’s chief of staff, are opposed to this plan, according to U.S. officials.

It was not known whether Prince’s proposal was brought up at the meeting.

With Afghan security forces struggling to prevent Taliban advances and the country’s political leadership all but paralyzed by infighting, Nicholson in February requested thousands of additional U.S. troops to bolster U.S. military trainers, advisers and special forces. U.S. military and intelligence officials are concerned that a Taliban victory would allow al Qaeda and Islamic State’s regional affiliate to establish bases in Afghanistan from which to plot attacks against the United States and its allies.

Annabelle Creation movie review: This Conjuring spin-off disappoints,"Annabelle Creation movie review: The questions we want answered are never asked in the movie. Annabelle Creation movie review: The questions we want answered are never asked in the movie.

Annabelle Creation movie cast: Miranda Otto, Stephanie Sigman, Anthony LaPaglia, Lulu Wilson

Annabelle Creation movie director: David Sandberg

Annabelle Creation movie rating: 2 stars

PARENTS frightened of their own child have sustained many a horror film. A malevolent spirit in a child’s doll many others. We needn’t look further than even The Conjuring, of which Annabelle: Creation is the fourth spin-off, and the prequel to a prequel. Yeah, by now, they should have this pat down. Annabelle: Creation has all that, plus a desolate house, orphans, nun, a mysterious woman behind a curtain, a forbidden door, a scarecrow, a barn, a basement, a chair lift, a lift hidden behind a wall, a well, and lots and lots of dolls. Who needs a story, or even one character that does things besides opening strange doors?

Sometime in the early 1940s, a doll-maker and his wife, Samuel (LaPaglia) and Esther (Otto) Mullins, lose their young daughter to an accident. They sequester themselves in their old, rickety farmhouse, away from all civilization, along with their grief, the doll Annabelle (named after their daughter) and “something else”. Twelve years later, to this house arrives a nun (Sigman) with six girls, her wards at an orphanage that has shut down. One of the girls, Janice (Bateman), is polio-afflicted, and left on her own by the other girls, starts exploring the house with its many secrets and strange happenings.

Then the happenings never cease, with director Sandberg (Lights Out) deploying largely the same tricks. The questions we want answered are never asked. So, we know nothing of the nun, but for the titillating detail that she was once at a “Romania convent where the other sisters have no contact with the outside world”; nothing about the girls, of varying ages and desires, and some more interesting than the others, stuck together; and almost zero about the couple who have put them in harm’s way. The actors, with the exception of Bateman, and that largely because she is the star victim this time, are largely impassive.

One thing is clear though, we are not done with Annabelle yet. The photo the nun shows of her Romania convent has a mysterious figure lurking in the shadows. Up next in The Conjuring series is Nun.

They say you have found your right man if you feel safe in his arms and he can just make your worries go away with one tight embrace. Maanayata Dutt’s new post on Instagram makes you want to believe in the saying. The actor shared an adorable picture with husband Sanjay Dutt and captioned it as, “In my happy and protective space…..@dutt1 your arms❤️” The two are spending some romantic time together in Dubai, and giving some serious relationship goals to their fans. As we already know, Sanjay Dutt feels extremely close to his family and we can see how he is managing his family life and work life with such perfection.

The actor has just wrapped the shoot of Bhoomi and was present at the trailer launch of the film. For the first time in his Bollywood career, Sanjay would be playing a father on screen to the character of Aditi Rao Hydari. Going by the trailer, one can say that nothing else could have made a perfect comeback for Sanju Baba (as he is fondly known in the industry).

Alongside his comeback, Sanjay has been constantly in touch with Ranbir Kapoor and Rajkumar Hirani for his biopic, in which Ranbir plays the lead as Sanjay Dutt. While Ranbir is Sanjay, it is Dia Mirza who would be playing Maanayata.

Talking to indianexpress.com, casting director Mukesh Chabbra said, “Dia is playing Maanayata. I read that story and they even have my name mentioned in it. I don’t know why it is there. There are so many people so they might have confused but for Maanayata it’s Dia.”

In the tentatively titled film, Dutt, one would see an ensemble cast of Paresh Rawal who will be seen in the role of Sunil Dutt and Manisha Koirala is playing Nargis. Actor Sonam Kapoor will be seen as one of Sanjay’s former flames and Vicky Kaushal is portraying one of the actor’s closest friends.
