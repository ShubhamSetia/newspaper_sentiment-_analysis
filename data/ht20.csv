Sharad Yadav in deal with Lalu to launch son from Bihar’s Madhepura in 2019?,"Janata Dal (United) Rajya Sabha MP Sharad Yadav, at odds with the official leadership of his party, is understood to have struck a deal with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad to field his son as the RJD candidate for the Madhepura seat in the next Lok Sabha poll.

Yadav has expressed his disagreement with JD (U) president Nitish Kumar’s decision last month to jettison the 20 month old grand alliance government in Bihar last month and to form a new one with the BJP, with himself has CM.

Much against the wishes of the JD (U)’s official leadership, Yadav has commenced a tour of Bihar on Thursday, dubbed the Jan Samvad Yatra, to “gauge public mood”. He has been sharing stage with RJD leaders and has been openly critical of the JD (U) leadership..

RJD insiders said Lalu had ‘agreed’ to field Sharad’s son Shantanu Bundela, a post graduate from London University, from Bihar as a quid pro quo for the JD (U) veteran’s ‘rebellion’ against Nitish Kumar. “The move suits both the Yadav stalwarts’ common agenda to keep CM Kumar on tenterhooks”, said a party leader.

However, no official confirmation of this move was available immediately.

Sharad’s supporters point out he had already been sidelined in the JD U). As such, getting for his son the Madhepura in north Bihar, which he had represented four times but, as JD (U) candidate, had lost to RJD’s Rajesh Ranjan aka Pappu Yadav, in 2014, sounded like a good deal.

Madhepura, a Yadav stronghold and land of BP Mandal, whose Mandal commission report formed the basis of job reservation for the other backward classes, in the early 1990s, is “available” in the sense that Pappu was expelled from RJD in May 2015 for questioning Lalu’s ‘family-centric’ politics.

The Madhepura seat was won by Sharad four times between 1991 and 2009, whereas Lalu, who broke away from the original Janata Dal, to form the RJD in July 1997, won the seat in 2004. In 2014, RJD’s Pappu Yadav won it, defeating JD (U)’s Sharad.

Despite being represented by political heavyweights, development has largely eluded Madhepura. An electric locomotive factory cleared during Lalu’s tenure as railway minister (2004-09) is still in a limbo. As its MP, Sharad has also faced flak for being away from the constituency and doing little for its development.

Old associates of Sharad are of the view that his ‘move’ to launch his son as RJD candidate was a gambit, considering sitting MP Pappu, who wields influence in Madhepura, had given no indication he was ready to give up the seat.

“Also, it won’t look very good for Sharad to launch his son in politics, considering he has always opposed dynastic politics”, said a Sharad supporter.

But at the veteran socialist leader hit Muzaffarpur district of north Bihar on Friday, his mood remained defiant. He accused party chief Nitish Kumar of intimidating his (Sharad’s) supporters. “They are handing out the threat of expulsion from the JD (U). This is intolerable”, he said."
Asian crisis: Virat Kohli-led India need series with Pakistan | Opinion,"There couldn’t have been a more apt Independence Day gift for India than the first clean sweep in an away Test series. This was also the first time a subcontinent team was blanked at home by a neighbour in a series of three or more Tests. That part, despite India’s obvious joy, is slightly worrying.

While credit must be given to Virat Kohli’s team for breaching Sri Lanka’s defences in 2015 before bulldozing them this time, it’s also an indicator of the slow death of Asian rivalry and invincibility. Pakistan can’t host a Test tour, Bangladesh --- despite their limited-overs success --- are not out of Test infancy, while Sri Lanka look scarily depleted and clueless after the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Muttiah Muralitharan.

(Read | India dismiss Sri Lanka to complete 3-0 rout, script historic cricket series win)

That leaves India as the undisputed subcontinent masters. Beat them at home and no team would be faulted for feeling on top of the world. India too wouldn’t mind the extra bit of attention England or Australia may devote to them. But what happens to the balance of world cricket?

At the turn of the century and even some years later, the subcontinent had its own way of sowing doubts in the minds of touring teams. Win in Lahore and the visitors would get a fitting reply in Karachi. If the touring seamers got movement at Eden Gardens, Chepauk shocked their batsmen with sharp turn. And by the time a tour of Sri Lanka arrived, many teams simply gave up. There was no respite from the subcontinent’s miseries even if one tour’s challenge was negated.

That’s why Ricky Ponting’s Australia is considered one of the best ever to tour the subcontinent, after beating Sri Lanka 3-0 and India 2-1 in 2004. This drubbing of Sri Lanka at the hands of ‘good friends’ India sends out a message that barring one country, the subcontinent may not stoke fear anymore. Zimbabwe have already given considerable shape to that fear by winning the ODI series in Sri Lanka in July before giving them a run for their money in the solitary Test.

That is why we need Pakistan to host tours as soon as possible. The ICC has tried to balance the Asian power struggle by pitting India and Pakistan often in the Future Tours Programme (FTP). According to the FTP, Pakistan were scheduled to host India in December, 2015 (three months after India beat Sri Lanka 2-1 away) and tour them right after the ODI series against Australia this year.

Had that happened, Kohli’s India would have been in for stiffer competition. Instead, an out-of-depth Sri Lanka will fill in for them in November.

Playing Pakistan of course needs government permission. But it won’t be a bad idea given the level of cricket produced when the two teams meet in ICC events. If not tour Pakistan, India could at least play them at the UAE, Pakistan’s adopted home. That could still lend some perspective to India’s successful run in Tests where they have to tour Australia, England and South Africa once in three years or so. Otherwise we may be consigned to watching more ill-matched Asian rivalry."

Virat Kohli completes 44th ODI half-century vs Sri Lanka,"India skipper Virat Kohli struck his 44th One-Day International half-century to steer his team towards an easy victory over Sri Lanka in the first match of the five-match series at the Dambulla International Stadium on Sunday. (India vs Sri Lanka : 1st ODI highlights)

Virat Kohli, who came in after the run out of opener Rohit Sharma, quickly raised a half-century partnership with Shikhar Dhawan, the pair adding their first 50 runs off just 38 deliveries against an ordinary Sri Lankan bowling attack.

The India skipper completed his half-century soon after Shikhar Dhawan got to his 11th ODI century, and his third ton on the current tour. Virat Kohli completed his fifty off exactly 50 deliveries, with six fours.

The Indian skipper, regarded as the best chaser of a target in limited-overs cricket, played steadily as Shikhar Dhawan at the other end attack the increasingly ragged Sri Lankan bowling attack.

The duo helped India win by nine wickets to take 1-0 lead in five -match series."
What's it like to get trolled all day long? Take a look.,"What’s it like to get trolled all day long?

Being an outspoken woman on Twitter is hard. To find out how hard, we gathered a day’s worth of tweets sent to four prominent Indian women — Barkha Dutt, Rana Ayyub, Tavleen Singh, and Madhu Kishwar. We then filtered those tweets for profane or abusive words, categorized them, and sped them up by a thousand times. Now you, too, can experience the vitriol unleashed upon these women over the course of a day. Warning: The following contains coarse language and may not be suitable for children.

Barkha Dutt @BDUTT Barkha Rani Jamke Barasti Hai. Emmy Nominated Reporter. Author.Contributing Columnist @WashingtonPost Contributing Ed @TheWeekLive . Argumentative!Yaaron Ka Yaar : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Twitter users who are unable or unwilling to engage with the content of Dutt’s reporting often resort, as a child might, to name calling. Dutt frequently endures sexist and racist slurs and violent threats. Trolls also accuse her of being a shill for political causes, typically left-wing ones. As you can see, some of the terms we’ve highlighted are not always used abusively. Sometimes they are even used supportively. Other terms are not abusive in and of themselves — Pakistani, for example, is just a nationality — but are used so frequently in abusive ways that we’ve included them here.

Rana Ayyub @RanaAyyub Journalist, writer, film buff. Rooted in Indian politics and social justice. Free, fair, fearless. Author of Gujarat Files-anatomy of a cover up. : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

For Ayyub, a Muslim, hateful tweets are often coloured by Islamophobia. Trolls like to pretend Ayyub is an agent of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and to demand she “return” to Pakistan. Any criticism of India or its government, however reasonable or constructive, may be deemed traitorous. The trolls are about as vicious to Ayyub as they are to Dutt — during the week beginning Monday, April 10 and ending Sunday, April 16, we tagged 2,582 abusive tweets mentioning Ayyub and 3,020 mentioning Dutt.

Tavleen Singh @tavleen_singh columnist, author : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Trolls spare no one. Even Singh, who has been generally supportive of the Modi government and is perceived as being more “right-wing” than Dutt or Ayyub, has been accused of being a Pakistani propagandist and an anti-national. Yet even a cursory glance through her tweets reveals that the harassment directed at Singh pales in comparison to that received by her more “left-wing” counterparts. Singh received 195 tweets we tagged as being potentially abusive during the entire week that began Monday, April 10 and ended Sunday, April 16 — that’s fewer than Dutt or Ayyub received on any given day throughout the week. Moreover, the hateful tweets sent in reply to Singh are often directed at people other than Singh herself.

Madhu Kishwar @madhukishwar Factarian, Averse to all Isms. Maulana Azad National Professor, ICSSR. Founder human rights organisation MANUSHI : : Pause Count of categories (some tweets have more than one), per half hour

Like Singh, Kishwar has been generally supportive of the Modi government; and, like Singh, the hateful tweets she receives are generally directed at people other than her. Rather, trolls try to dissuade her from even engaging people with whom they disagree. Unlike the other women here, Kishwar occasionally resorts to ad hominem attacks herself, calling her opponents names like libtard and Aaptard.

A note on our methodology These tweets were collected on the evening of April 17, 2017, using Twitter’s free REST API. We collected as many tweet mentions as possible for all four women, and then selected the day with the highest minimum tagged tweets among the four. That day was April 14, when Dutt was mentioned in 520 tagged tweets, Ayyub was mentioned in 433, Kiswhar was mentioned in 117, and Singh was mentioned in 56 tagged tweets. We chose the terms used to tag the tweets by reading through hundreds of tweets and noting which words seemed to be most often used in abusive contexts. This is not an exhaustive list — some abusive tweets were missed, while other non-abusive ones were included."

The Evacuation of Tezpur: A family recounts the story of its flight during the Indo-China war of 1962,"Most of us look at personal experience and the history contained in books as separate things. It is only with time and effort that one sees how the threads of individual lives go on to weave a larger picture. In November 1962, with the Indian army in retreat from the Kameng sector of what is now Arunachal Pradesh (then North East Frontier Agency, or NEFA), panic spread through the small town of Tezpur in Assam – the nearest sizeable settlement, on the north bank of the Brahmaputra. We take so much of our past for granted, and it was only recently while talking to an aunt about the evacuation of people from Tezpur across the Brahmaputra that the full scale of the event became clear to me. A few details I had picked up over the years, after I had returned to the North East in 2011. Earlier, I just knew that something called the “Chinese aggression” had happened.

It was hard to imagine the chaos that would have descended upon that small town, the thousands of people in bullock carts and vehicles crowding the steamer ghat to flee to the other side of the river. The tea planters, several British among them, and the senior administrative figures like the DC and the SP had flown out from the small airport at Salonibari on the outskirts of Tezpur, and no one was left in charge.

When The ‘Lamas’ Came

My aunt, who is now 77, and one of five surviving sisters from a total of six sisters and a brother, as usual started her story with a diversion, with an incident from 1959: “It was after my first child was born that the Tibetans had come down to Missamari. The DC asked our uncle to make temporary shelters from bamboo and straw for them. So we went from Tezpur with our uncle in his jeep to see them, me and our elder sister who was back home from medical college in Dibrugarh. People had started calling the place Lama Camp by then, because of all the Tibetans who had fled with the Dalai Lama from Tibet. I remember they would pour atta and water into a bamboo sunga or tube and churn that to have as food. That and their prayer beads; it was all the women did. We had seen the Dalai Lama in Tezpur. He still looks the same I think.”

An episode from almost 60 years ago: Missamari was an army camp with an old runway to the north-west of Tezpur; during the Second World War it was one of the air bases in Bengal and Assam from where American-built Douglas DC-3s and C-47s had flown to Kunming in China’s Yunnan province to supply Chiang Kai Shek’s nationalist troops. Lama Camp was since absorbed into the growing army base. Above Missamari had been thick forests, and above them rose the forested Eastern Himalayas of the Kameng region.

Not far from Missamari at the foothills was a road camp known as Foothills (where later khachars or mules were trained for carrying supplies and equipment up in the mountains). The Dalai Lama had carried on to Tezpur, from where he addressed the press. Then he went by train to Dehradun and onwards to Mussoorie, which was where Jawaharlal Nehru met him.The occupants of Lama Camp followed him in stages to Himachal Pradesh.

“After my second child’s anno proxon (the ceremony where the child is fed solid rice for the first time) in my mother’s place in Ketekibari on 17 or 18 November in 1962,” my aunt continued, “we had gone to Sootea near Tezpur. Coming back the next evening, we saw army officers and tea garden managers leaving in cars and trucks.

“That night none of the men in the village including Baba (my aunt’s father, and my grandfather) slept at night. We could hear the explosions all the way from Missamari, where the army’s ammunition stocks were being blown up.

“The next day people were going here and there. Word had spread that the Chinese were coming. My sisters (including my mother) came back early from school, saying that everyone had left. Our mother was complaining no one had cooked. We put up some rice and dal on the kitchen fire. One of our brothers-in-law who was a ‘nazir’ in the DC office then turned up in a jeep with his parents, telling us to come along to the steamer ghat. In the confusion our mother left her money behind, but I was carrying my husband’s money with me. My younger sisters put some rice and dal in a milk jug to carry with us. We went to the steamer ghat. Just as we reached the jeep’s tyre got punctured.

“It was chaos at the ghat. One army man, a Nepali, was with his child who was crying. The mother was in hospital the man said. A British woman wearing brown trousers had a child who had fever and was crying; she brought water from the river and gave it to him. There were hundreds of people all around. A lady went into labour and gave birth there on the sand. We managed to cross over to the other side of the Brahmaputra, and then went to Samaguri in a bus arranged by our brother-in-law. I remember my son’s milk bottle fell and broke when we reached the place, a house belonging to someone we knew that had been emptied for us. My brother, and my husband who was in Dhekiajuli, arrived, and then left after a day or two. Baba stayed behind in Tezpur. Later he told us how they had provided drinking water to the jawans who were retreating on foot. We bought things from a nearby market, cooked, ate, slept on beds made on the floor in the empty house. There were our brother-in-law’s parents, our mother, my two sisters, and my eldest sister’s daughter, who was worried about the kitten she had left behind in Ketekibari. After a few days we went back to Tezpur.” (This would have happened after the ceasefire).

What Was Left Behind

My mother was in class 7 then; they had just started wearing the mekhela sador that the older girls in the government school were allowed to wear, and she says that she folded up her school uniform and took it along just in case. My father, who was roughly the same age as my mother, was then in Dhubri in lower Assam where my grandfather, who was in the police, was posted. My grandfather’s elder brother’s family came down from Tezpur then to stay with them. He himself was busy on duty, part of the effort to stop vehicles and buses from crossing over the interstate border into Bengal; then the roads were sealed.

My aunt continued, “Later we came to know that the DC had gone to see off his wife and young son at the airport near Tezpur, and when the son cried he got into the plane as well. The SP also left. Several young men, including our brother, got together to form a defence force and collected sticks and guns, to try and do what they could if the Chinese reached Tezpur. The electricity supply office and other places were supposed to have been blown up, but in the end there was no one to carry out the orders. The State Bank’s coins were all dumped in the pukhuri or pond before the police station (the manager had already burnt the paper currency), and we heard some people dove in at night to pick up the coins. The staff in the jail and the mental hospital left, so the inmates were given some money and let off, and the ones from the latter roamed around the deserted town.”

The Ones Who Got Away

I thought I had heard somewhere that the inmates of the mental hospital had wandered about shouting “China zindabad”, because they thought the Chinese had set them free. Maybe a foreign reporter was responsible for this story. When I asked my eldest aunt (who had been in medical college when she visited Lama Camp) about this though she said nothing of the sort had happened. During those events in 1962 she was in Edinburgh studying medicine, and had seen what my other aunt had described in black-and-white newspaper photos (even recognising a cousin with his parents getting onto a steamer).

“The staff at the mental hospital had all left,” my eldest aunt, now 81 and still a practising doctor in Tezpur, told me. “I remember there was this huge man who carried all 57 keys with him. So the more normal ones, those kept confined by their families following property disputes or marriage problems, were given the keys and money and told to look after the more serious inmates. The doctor who was in charge later got awarded for organising that. The jail staff had also left, and the prisoners must have been turned loose.”

The doctor who was in charge of the mental hospital later settled in Shillong, and sometimes came to meet my father. He had served in World War II in the medical corps, and had later studied at McGill University in Canada. His wife, who had been a nurse in the medical corps, was a Khasi; they had no children, and lived in a neat little Assam-type cottage with his clinic beside the house. There were plants and orchids all around, and in the spotlessly clean sitting room (a polished bamboo mat on the wooden floor) which the wife opened only on special occasions, were several dried and varnished gourds – I think it was a hobby of his. The doctor had been posted in the Garo Hills region. I remember he told my parents about going down to a river where they would catch prawns by the kilo, and he would later eat about a kilo of prawns by himself. I suppose even at that young age I had intimations of a vanishing world, of a disappearing wilderness.

Lost In Time

A few weeks after my aunt had told me about the steamer crossing, I happened to be looking up “Missamari” on the internet, and came across two old photos of the Tibetans at Lama Camp in a review of a book of photographs on the exiles. In grainy black-and-white, one showed men in traditional clothes walking down a track, a few holding on to the reins of their horses, some huts and the jungle close by; the other showed a crowd of men around a wide track, many in vests and open shirts, sitting (on what seemed like piles of firewood) and standing in orderly fashion, a line of the bamboo-and-thatch shelters visible behind them, and nearby the silhouette of the hills of Arunachal (or NEFA as it was known then).

The larger history involving small places like Tezpur is something that has to be sought out – the material isn’t always ‘out there’ somewhere, and can frequently disappear with the passing away of people.

This would have been the beginning of the Tibetan diaspora, the first people who followed the Dalai Lama out of Tibet after the Chinese took over. Two things struck me then: the first was the whimsy of history, for if the Chinese had decided to come down till Tezpur in 1962 and stay on, my mother might have ended up an exile as well, separated from her place of birth by the wide Brahmaputra, just like the Tibetans in those two photos were to be separated from their home by the high Himalayas; the second was that the larger history involving small places like Tezpur, where I was born in 1975, and Shillong, where I had gone to school, was something that had to be sought out – the material wasn’t always ‘out there’ somewhere, and could frequently disappear with the passing away of people.

Ankush Saikia is based in Shillong, and is the author of the Detective Arjun Arora series. The above piece is part of a book he’s working on, on the north bank region of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh above the Brahmaputra.

Binge on these five super TV shows to escape the disaster that has been 2016,"Demonetisation. The US election outcome. Pollution. Leonard Cohen no more. Kashmir. Kanpur train derailing… And these are events that have occurred only over the last few weeks. The list gets longer and longer as you go back month-on-month to the disaster that has been 2016. So if you, like us, are feeling overwhelmed and need a different world to flee to – even if figuratively – here are five fantastic TV shows to binge-watch that promise an escape, alright. So get streaming and wake up (to a better reality, hopefully) when December ends.

Stranger Things

This Netflix-original that debuted in July this year, and which is possibly one of the best shows of 2016, is a sci-fi thriller with a liberal dose of mystery, drama and jumpy horror moments thrown in. But what makes Stranger Things so special – apart from the nail-biting plot and stellar cast – is the possibility it offers of an alternate universe where everything is just the same as yours, yet quite not so. The ‘Upside Down’ may not exactly be the kind of world you were hoping to escape to, but it is exciting no less.

Black Mirror

The third season of this highly acclaimed satirical sci-fi series released last month and the ratings have already been through the roof. Unlike the first two seasons that had three episodes each, this has six marvels, each with a different plot and cast. And each is a terrifying study into our world today – obsessed with technology, social media and keeping up appearances online – and the world we might be living in if we aren’t careful enough. As series creator Charlie Brooker said in a 2011 The Guardian interview when the show first premiered, “They’re all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes’ time if we’re clumsy”.

The 100

Another science fiction, this one is a post-Apocalyptic action drama that rolls both utopia and dystopia into one action-packed, heart-thumping show. Ninety-seven years after a nuclear war wipes out civilisation on earth, a spaceship housing the last lone survivors starts running critically low on life support. So it sends back 100 juvenile lawbreakers back to earth in the hope of repopulating the planet. You’ll be making a mistake if you plan to leave the rest to imagination.

The Returned

Adapted from the 2012 French series Les Revenants, this supernatural thriller that released last year will give you all the creeps, and then some feels. A sleepy little mountain town is suddenly thrown into complete chaos when several locals come back from the dead. No, literally! As if resurrecting from their other worlds wasn’t enough, they also haven’t aged and are unaware of their own deaths. The shock of their families is only understandable, but what is difficult to comprehend are the strange happenings that begin to occur in the town following their arrival. [PS: You might want to watch the French original, as the English one was called off air abruptly. Talk of strange happenings!]

The Night Of

This crime thriller that premiered in August this year had even Shah Rukh Khan hooked, reportedly. Don’t be discouraged by the fact that there is not even a hint of any other world in this – it’s simply set in present-day New York. Sometimes, a different world can exist in your own mind, where the sequence of events is vastly different from what is presumed by others to have occurred – especially when there’s alcohol and a cocktail of drugs involved. This is what happens when after a night of partying with a female stranger, a man wakes up to find her stabbed to death and is charged with her murder. Add prevailing racial tensions in the mix, and you’ve a total mind-bender.

"Breast cancer may kill 76,000 Indian women every year by 2020","Lack of early diagnosis of breast cancer may kill 76,000 Indian women a year by 2020, says a study, one of whose researchers is of Indian origin.

One of the most commonly diagnosed type of cancers among women in India, breast cancer claimed 70,218 lives in 2012, the study published in the Journal of Business Research showed. It also revealed that the average age of death from the disease has shifted from 50 years to 30 years.

The magnitude of the problem is enormous and has major policy implications for the Indian government, said Vijay Pereira, Associate Dean (Research) at the University of Wollongong in Dubai. Pereira said there were complex challenges at national, state and community levels.

“What is clear is that healthcare at state-level must transform to deliver quality care and awareness,” Pereira said. The researchers found lack of awareness about self-examination and cultural barriers played a major role. Women sought medical care extremely late. Women do not get access to health services and are reluctant to consult male doctors, neglecting their health due to family obligations. They are over-dependent on other family members. All of these cause delay in diagnosis, the researchers said.

Thus, educating Indian men about the significance of early diagnosis for breast cancer, could be the key to halt the disease which is turning into an epidemic, the researchers suggested. “India is still a patriarchal society. Although women are now in responsible jobs and earning for their families, it’s the men who are the head of the household,” said Judith Fletcher-Brown, from the University of Portsmouth in England.

Even educated professional women do not discuss private matters about their bodies with their husbands, fathers or brothers. So it’s essential to direct health messages towards men, Fletcher-Brown said.

Rapid economic development and greater urbanisation are also responsible for the rise in breast cancer rates, the researchers noted. Besides, women tend to have children at a later age and breast feeding is less, which increases their chances of developing the disease. Working women in urban India often have a more western diet leading to obesity. That also increases the risk. The study said community health nurses had the greatest impact in raising awareness of early breast cancer symptoms. In addition, schools and media were also found to be good channels through which awareness could be raised in young women.

Cannes 2017: Naomi Kawase’s Radiance is radiantly refreshing,"The Japanese director, Naomi Kawase, is a Cannes Film Festival veteran, and has had several of her movies play here. She has also been on Cinefondation and Short Film Jury in 2016. Her 2015 Sweet Bean (An in Japanese) - which was part of the festival’s A Certain Regard -- was a extraordinarily touching story of an old woman who helps a dorayaki shop to become popular with her yummy bean paste.

Equally moving is Kawase’s latest, Radiance (Hikari in Japanese), where the auteur takes us into the world of the blind and partially-sighted -- tracing the relationship between a photographer whose vision is fading and a woman who pens movie audio descriptions.

Kawase uses disability most artfully to weave a love story between Misako (Misaki Ayame) - who is writing a description for the visually challenged -- and Nakamori (Nagase Masatoshi), a celebrated photographer. He is one of Misako’s listeners. On the verge of blindness, he is caustic and angry. Misako has her own tragedies to grapple with: a father who mysteriously disappeared several years ago and a mother sinking into dementia. Perhaps these misfortunes push her to understand Nakamori’s frustration.

Radiance is a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr.

Radiance -- Kawase’s fifth work to debut in the festival’s Competition and a strong contender for this year’s Palm dÓr -- draws us softly into Nakamori’s and Misako’s world that sees disillusionment, rage and arguments till a chance meeting pulls them towards each other. An emotionally charged scene in which he feels her face is far more erotic than a kiss they share later.

Brilliantly photographed in soft light, Radiance is a work that haunts us with its delicate treatment and subtle messages. Something that is a typical Kawase, whose Radiance loyally follows in the path of her many films in the past, particular Sweet Bean.

"Highlights, India vs Sri Lanka 1st ODI: Dhawan 132*, Kohli 82* give IND crushing win","Shikhar Dhawan was at his sublime best as he blasted his 11th century. He shared a 197-run stand for the second wicket with Virat Kohli, who chipped in with a valuable 82*, his 44th fifty in ODIs. The contribution by these two batsmen helped India crush Sri Lanka by nine wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. Catch highlights of India vs Sri Lanka here. (SCORECARD | STREAMING INFO)

21:00 hrs IST: That is all we have from here. Join us for the second match in Pallekele starting on Thursday. Bye Bye.

20:59 hrs IST: Virat Kohli: We thought we would chase close to 300, it was a good pitch to bat on. The point of batting second was that it would come on later in the day. It came on like a dream. The last three months have been a great tome for Dhawan and he’s cashing in on his purple patch. Hopefully he stays in this happy zone and we’ll make sure he stays there, because he will win you games as long he’s in it.

20:52 hrs IST: Upul Tharanga: We didn’t capitalise. The middle order collapsed. One stage, we were thinking of 300. If you want to score 300 in an ODI, someone has to get a big score.

20:47 hrs IST: Shikhar Dhawan is the Man of the Match. He says, “I have only kept my focus on the processes and not on the results. The mental preparation helps me keep confidence in myself.”

20:40 hrs IST: With 127 balls to spare, this margin of victory for India is the highest in ODIs against Sri Lanka in terms of balls remaining while chasing a target of over 200.

20:35 hrs IST: FOUR! India win! Fittingly, it is Dhawan who finishes it off. Flighted delivery and the batsman dances down the track to blast it down the ground. India crush Sri Lanka by nine wickets to go 1-0 up in the five-match series. For Sri Lanka, this loss will hurt big time.

20:31 hrs IST: FOUR! Simply brilliant. Full ball from Malinga and Kohli creams the straight drive to the long on fence. Shades of Hobart 2012 in that shot.

20:24 hrs IST: FOUR, FOUR, SIX! Magnificent from Kohli. He whips a full ball on the pads to deep mid wicket, sweeps a tossed up ball to long leg and then pummels a lofted shot to long on for a six.

20:22 hrs IST: FOUR! Dhawan blasts a pull shot to deep square leg and he now has the highest individual score by an Indian batsman at this venue.

20:20 hrs IST: DROPPED! Dhawan can do no wrong. He miscues the off-cutter from Malinga and Upul Tharanga runs back but fails to latch on to the catch at long on. Slinga is wondering what must he do to take a wicket.

20:17 hrs IST: SIX! Crunching shot from Dhawan. Flighted delivery and the left-hander dances down the track to whack it over long off for his third six.

20:15 hrs IST: FOUR! In the air but safe! Shortish delivery and Dhawan miscues the pull shot but it is wide of the mid on fielder. India need only 44 more to win.

20:12 hrs IST: FOUR! India are motoring along as Dhawan blasts another boundary to the long off fence.

20:10 hrs IST: Fifty for Virat Kohli. His 44th in ODIs. It has been effortless. This is a drubbing in Dambulla.

20:06 hrs IST: FOUR! Take a bow, Shikhar Dhawan! Flatter delivery and Dhawan steers it to the third man fence for a blazing century. What a tour he is having so far.

20:05 hrs IST: FOUR! Dhawan into the 90s. Low full toss and the left-hander drills it to the long off fence. Couple of balls later, he powerfully sweeps a flighted delivery to the deep backward square leg fence.

20:02 hrs IST: DROPPED! That sums up Sri Lanka. Short and close to the off stump, Dhawan pokes at it but Dickwella is unable to latch on to it. Nothing going right for Sri Lanka.

20:01 hrs IST: FOUR! Kohli muscles the pull shot past long on for another boundary. He is nearing his fifty.

20:00 hrs IST: India need just 82 off 30 overs. This is demoralising for Sri Lanka as the one-sided nature of this tour continues.

19:55 hrs IST: FOUR! Unstoppable. Dhawan pounds a flighted delivery past extra cover for yet another boundary. This is becoming very one-sided.

19:53 hrs IST: FOUR! The partnership between Dhawan and Kohli is past 100. Dhawan employs the reverse sweep against Lakshan Sandakan and he finds the boundary.

19:50 hrs IST: Not a good start for Wanindu Hasaranga. Short ball and Dhawan crunches the pull shot to the deep mid wicket fence.

19:49 hrs IST: Much better over from Sandakan. Only four runs scored but India are in cruise mode at the moment. After 17 overs, India are 113/1.

19:41 hrs IST: FOUR! Sublime from Kohli. He leans on to the full ball from Thisara and he finds the long on fence.

19:38 hrs IST: FOUR! Dhawan is in that zone now. He employs the reverse sweep and whacks it to third man for a boundary.

19:36 hrs IST: FOUR! Dhawan is simply unstoppable as he blazes a drive past extra cover for another boundary. Sri Lanka are being torn apart here. Not helped by a misfield in that particular delivery.

19:34 hrs IST: SIX! Another great shot. Short ball from Malinga and Dhawan top-edges the pull shot over the fine leg fence.

19:31 hrs IST: SIX! What a shot! What a way to bring up his 22nd fifty. Short ball from Sandakan and Dhawan crashes the pull shot to the deep mid wicket fence. He continues his great form.

19:24 hrs IST: The partnership between Dhawan and Kohli has gone past 50. The left-handed Dhawan is nearing a half century.

19:17 hrs IST: FOUR! Dhawan is nearing his fifty. He blasts two consecutive boundaries as Sri Lanka leak runs.

19:15 hrs IST: FOUR! Kohli relishes the opportunity on the pads and he flicks Thisara Perera to the deep square leg.

19:07 hrs IST: FOUR ! Kohli gets into the fun now as he creams a couple of fours, one to fine leg and one to extra cover. India racing along.

19:03 hrs IST: FOUR! Sri Lanka are unable to stop Dhawan. He creams a pull shot to the deep mid wicket fence twice. India are 40/1 in the eighth over.

18:59 hrs IST: FOUR! Dhawan is looking in sublime touch. He simply leans into the shot and caresses it to the deep extra cover fence.

18:53 hrs IST: WICKET! Oh dear, calamity for Rohit Sharma. He sets off for a quick single and the throw comes from backward point, Rohit’s loses his bat and looks back which costs him time, he tries to leap back into the crease but his foot is in the air and he is run-out. Rohit Sharma run-out (Kapugedera) 4 (13).

18:49 hrs IST: Rohit Sharma has started cautiously while Dhawan continues to be in great touch. Sri Lanka need some inspired bowling from Malinga, who is playing his 200th ODI.

18:43 hrs IST: FOUR! Dhawan continues to find the fence and India need less than a 200.

18:39 hrs IST: FOUR! Shikhar Dhawan has gotten going with two boundaries. This is a good pitch for the batsmen.

18:35 hrs IST: Vishwa Fernando comes into the attack.

18:33 hrs IST: Decent start from Malinga. India 4/0 after first over.

18:30 hrs IST: Rohit Sharma to take strike. Lasith Malinga to start the proceedings for the hosts.

18:29 hrs IST: Welcome back!

17:46 hrs IST: WICKET! Jasprit Bumrah ends the innings as he cleans up Vishwa Fernando for 0. Sri Lanka all out for 216 and they have lost nine wickets for 77 runs. Poor show yet again by the hosts.

17:42 hrs IST: Edged but safe! Good length ball on off stump and Mathews looks to steer it to third man, but the outside edge runs away to the boundary.

17:36 hrs IST: Chahal finishes his spell. 10-0-60-2. Can Mathews help Sri Lanka get past 230?

17:33 hrs IST: WICKET! Smart bowling from Chahal. Malinga dances down the track but the legspinner fires a quick ball wide outside off and the batsman is unable to reach it, Dhoni effects an easy stumping. Lasith Malinga st Dhoni b Chahal 8 (6).

17:29 hrs IST: Lasith Malinga joins in the fun as he dances down the track and launches Axar Patel for a six over wide long on.

17:26 hrs IST: Mathews breaks the shackles with a slog swept six of Chahal. Sri Lanka need a lot more. That was the first boundary after 14 overs.

17:21 hrs IST: WICKET! Axar takes his third. Flatter delivery and it straightens, Sandakan hangs back and plays down the wrong line, he gets hit on the pads and the umpire raises the finger. No reviews left for Sri Lanka. Lakshan Sandakan LBW Axar Patel 5 (8).

17:15 hrs IST: Mathews holds the key now. But with 12 overs remaining, India will be going for the kill and pick up the remaining wickets quickly.

17:10 hrs IST: WICKET! Jasprit Bumrah at his deadly best. The yorker on the middle and leg stump line, Thisara Perera cannot get his bat down in time and the ball uproots the middle stump. Thisara Perera b Jasprit Bumrah 0 (5).

17:07 hrs IST: Sri Lanka have lost five wickets for 37 runs. Just sums up their current situation sadly.

17:04 hrs IST: WICKET! Poor shot from Hasaranga and Sri Lanka are collapsing. He dances down the track and miscues a lofted shot off Axar Patel but Jadhav runs back and takes a catch overhead. Wanidu Hasaranga c Kedar Jadhav b Axar Patel 2(5)

16:56 hrs IST: WICKET! Sri Lanka are crumbling. Kapugedera taps it to cover and takes a single but Kohli fires a rocket throw at the bowler’s end, the batsman is short despite the dive. Chamara Kapugedera run out (Virat kohli) 1 (2).

16:47 hrs IST: WICKET! What a way to go. A juicy high full toss and Upul Tharanga can only hit it straight down to long on. They check for a no-ball but the bowler is fine. Upul Tharanga c Shikhar Dhawan b Kedar Jadhav 13 (23).

16:38 hrs IST: Spinners are operating from both ends and Sri Lanka are unable to get going. Upul Tharanga and Angelo Mathews have to build a solid partnership. After 28 overs, Sri Lanka are 156/3.

16:30 hrs IST: WICKET! Poor shot by Kusal Mendis. He dances down the track and slogs mindlessly but he misses it and the off stump is knocked out. Axar Patel starts dancing. Kusal Mendis b Axar Patel 36 (37).

16:26 hrs IST: FOUR! Poor ball from Axar. Quick ball but on the pads, Mendis clips it to the fine leg fence. Sri Lanka 145/2 after 26 overs.

16:20 hrs IST: WICKET! Kedar Jadhav strikes. Flatter delivery that zips through, Dickwella attempts the sweep but misses it and the umpire raises the finger, the batsman reviews but it does not save him. Niroshan Dickwella LBW Kedar Jadhav 64 (78).

16:18 hrs IST: Good tight over from Axar Patel but India need to break this stand. Sri Lanka have laid out a good platform.

16:12 hrs IST: FOUR! The fifty run stand is up and Dickwella is growing in confidence as he blasts two fours off Kedar Jadhav.

16:09 hrs IST: Fifty for Dickwella. His fifth in ODIs. Been a solid knock from him and the partnership is nearing fifty.

16:05 hrs IST: Kedar Jadhav comes into the attack and concedes one run. Maybe it is time for Axar Patel?

16:02 hrs IST: FOUR! Edged and another boundary for Kusal Mendis. 14 runs in the over from Chahal, a very expensive one.

16:00 hrs IST: FOUR! Kusal Mendis is in the groove now. Back to back boundaries off Yuzvendra Chahal and the crowd are loving it in Dambulla. He could have made it three in a row but he hits a short ball straight to deep square leg for a single.

15:57 hrs IST: The 100 is up for Sri Lanka. Gunathilaka is the key now for Sri Lanka while the lower middle order will also be the key.

15:51 hrs IST: Mendis loves to play the sweep shot and he connects well. Gets on top of the bounce and slams it to the long leg fence.

15:47 hrs IST: Run-out chance missed! Dickwella taps this short delivery to backward point and hesitates in taking the single, KL Rahul misses with the throw at the bowler’s end. Would have been curtains for Dickwella.

15:42 hrs IST: FOUR! Short and wide ball from Chahal, Gunathilaka cracks the square cut to the deep point fence. Sri Lanka 81/1 after 16 overs. Time for drinks.

15:37 hrs IST: Good ball from Bumrah. Gets this back of a length delivery to nip back in and Mendis is cut in half. That was close to the off stump.

15:36 hrs IST: WICKET! Gunathilaka tries the reverse sweep but he mishits it totally and the catch is taken at backward point. Poor shot. Danushka Gunathilaka c Virat Kohli b Yuzvendra Chahal 35 (44).

15:30 hrs IST: Run-out chance? Dickwella is just in. Total confusion as he taps a flighted ball to mid off and thinks about a single, but he is sent back. The fielder fires the throw but the dive from the batsman saves him.

15:26 hrs IST: Both batsmen are looking increasingly comfortable at the wicket. A bit of low bounce as Bumrah bowls the offcutter.

15:22 hrs IST: Yuzvendra Chahal is into the attack. He replaces Pandya. Can he get a wicket?

15:19 hrs IST: FOUR! Superb shot from Dickwella. Full ball outside off, the left-hander lofts it over mid on for another boundary. Sri Lanka 64/0 after 11 overs.

15:17 hrs IST: The change has come. Jasprit Bumrah is into the attack. Can he break this solid stand. Dickwella and Gunathilaka have two double century stands, for your information.

15:15 hrs IST: Both Bhuvneshwar and Pandya have bowled unchanged ever since the start. Time for a change of bowling one feels.

15:10 hrs IST: The 50-run opening stand is up between Dickwella and Gunathilaka. Short and wide from Bhuvneshwar and the batsman slants the bat to steer the delivery to the third man fence. Sri Lanka 52/0 after nine overs.

15:05 hrs IST: FOUR! Back to back boundaries by Danushka Gunthilaka. He cuts a short ball to deep point and then pulls another short ball to deep mid wicket. After eight overs, Sri Lanka’s run-rate is 5.2.

15:01 hrs IST: This has been a confident start for Sri Lanka. Dickwella and Gunathilaka are looking in good touch. This is a flat Dambulla wicket.

14:55 hrs IST: Inside edged but safe! Dickwella looks to make some room but Pandya tries to cramp him with a short ball, the batsman adjusts but it results in an inside edge that goes to the fine leg fence. Sri Lanka 27/0 after six overs.

14:51 hrs IST: Sharp fielding from Kedar Jadhav. Gunathilaka makes room and flays a short ball to shortish cover where the fielder stops it. Only one run conceded by Bhuvneshwar as India pull things back.

14:47 hrs IST: Much better over from Pandya. Just one run conceded.

14:42 hrs IST: FOUR! Confident start from Sri Lanka. Full but slightly wide outside off, Gunathilaka creams the drive on the up past extra cover. After three overs, Sri Lanka are 19/0.

14:41 hrs IST: Edged but safe! Loose stroke from Dickwella. Short and swinging away wide outside off, the batsman reaches out and steers it just wide of gully.

14:40 hrs IST: FOUR! Another poor ball. Bhuvneshwar this time floats a swinging ball on the pads and Dickwella whips it to the deep mid wicket fence.

14:38 hrs IST: FOUR! First boundary of the Sri Lanka innings. Full ball from Pandya but on the pads, Gunathilaka flicks it over mid wicket for a confident boundary.

14:35 hrs IST: Hardik Pandya will partner Bhuvneshwar. He has the ability to extract a bit of extra bounce and pace from the wicket.

14:30 hrs IST: Edged but safe! Bhuvneshwar angles a full ball across outside off and it seams away, Dickwella pokes at it but the edge lands safely in front of second slip.

14:29 hrs IST: Dhanushka Gunathilaka and Niroshan Dickwella are opening the batting. Bhuvneshwar Kumar opens the bowling for India.

14:22 hrs IST: Both Virat Kohli and Upul Tharanga have special memories of Dambulla. In 2008, Kohli made his ODI debut at this ground and opened the batting. In 2005, Upul Tharanga also made his debut for Sri Lanka at this very venue. He too opened the batting.

14:17 hrs IST: Sri Lanka hold a 7-4 record over India in Dambulla. This is the first time India are playing at the venue since 2010, when they lost to the hosts by 74 runs.

14:08 hrs IST: Playing XIs

India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli(c), Lokesh Rahul, MS Dhoni(w), Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal

Sri Lanka: Niroshan Dickwella(w), Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Upul Tharanga(c), Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedera, Wanidu Hasaranga, Thisara Perera, Lakshan Sandakan, Vishwa Fernando, Lasith Malinga

14:04 hrs IST: While we await news of the Indian team, Sri Lanka have brought in Chamara Kapugedera and Thisara Perera. This Sri Lankan side is a lot more experienced than the Test side.

14:00 hrs IST: India have won the toss and have decided to field.

13:56 hrs IST: Lasith Malinga will be playing his 200th ODI. Can he make it extra special and take 300 ODI wickets?

13:50 hrs IST: After a 3-0 drubbing in the Tests, can Sri Lanka pull off a surprise in the ODIs? Looking at the form of the Indian team, it looks unlikely.

13:40 hrs IST: Conditions in Dambulla are fine and one hopes that there is no interruptions.

13:20 hrs IST: Sri Lanka will look to secure direct qualification for the 2019 ICC World Cup without being dependent on West Indies’ results, and will need two wins from the ongoing series for the same.

13:05 hrs IST: In Sri Lanka, India have won 23 of 56 matches, losing 27 of the games. Six games produced no result.

12:50 hrs IST: India have won 83 of the previous encounters against Sri Lanka. The islanders have won 55, while 12 matches, including a tied game, have produced no result.

12:35 hrs IST: This is the 151st ODI encounter between India and Sri Lanka. No two teams have played each other as frequently as these two. Pakistan-Sri Lanka is second at 148, and Australia-West Indies third at 139.

12:20 hrs IST: Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the 1st ODI between India and Sri Lanka in Dambulla today. India go into this series as the overwhelming favourites.

Upul Tharanga-led Sri Lanka have more than just pride at stake in this five-match ODI series. The 1996 world champions will have to win at least two matches to secure a direct place in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 by staving off the challenge from the West Indies. The cut-off date for direct qualification is September 30.

Sri Lanka are currently placed eighth with 88 points, 10 points more than the West Indies, who have an unenviable task in their aim of being among the seven top-ranked sides, apart from hosts England, to gain direct qualification.

However, a 4-1 win for India will see Sri Lanka finish at 88 points and the Windies could edge them on decimal points if they win all their upcoming six matches. The Windies side will go out of contention if it loses to Ireland as from there it will at best reach 86 points and remain behind Sri Lanka on decimal points, even if Sri Lanka lose 5-0 to India."
Janmashtami 2017: Shri Krishna aka Sarvadaman says he hasn’t seen the show till date,"With an irreplaceable smile, when actor Sarvadaman D Banerjee narrated couplets from the Bhagavad Gita, for the 90’s Indian television series Shri Krishna, the world outside TV came to a standstill. But, Banerjee says: “I never wanted to do TV. I was working in films because a single shot in a film stays for 100 years. Then, Ramanand Sagar [the creator of the show] called me. I knew this invitation would offer me a role in TV and thus I didn’t want to go. I believed TV isn’t an art; even today it isn’t one.”

When he finally relented to meet Sagar, he found himself in a studio where the set for shoot was ready. “I entered and a stack of papers was handed over to me saying, ‘These are your dialogues...’ I tried to run away, but then Ramanand Sagar turned up and the rest is history.”

Sarvadaman D Banerjee in a still from the show Shri Krishna.

The show that went on-air post the cult series, Ramayana, was initially supposed to run for 2-3 years. “And it ran for 10 years! I shot the entire serial in a state of meditation. I signed the show in 1990 and by 1994, with the rising popularity of the show rising, I felt that an atom bomb had fallen into my bedroom. But till date, I have never bothered to see the show,” says the actor.

He feels his “karmic potli” was over post Shri Krishna, and hence he didn’t get much work. “After a few years of shooting Shri Krishna, I once asked Sagar: When will you direct me? He said: Whenever I see you, I see the supreme, so I just end up folding my hands. There’s isn’t a better compliment that a director can give.”

Rise of student bodies in Panjab University: From 10 in 2013 to 21 in 2017,"With an atmosphere that encourages active student politics, Panjab University has witnessed an upsurge in new student organisation on campus in the last four years.

Gandhi Group Students Union (GGSU)

In 2013, Panjab University Campus Students Council (PUCSC) elections, saw only 10 student organisations pitted against each other. This year, the number has risen to 21 student bodies, all of which are in the fray for the elections scheduled for September.

Council president of PU in 2013, Chandan Rana, said, “In the last four years, PU has witnessed a lot of change when it comes to political and non-political organisations. Earlier, parties contested on individual capacity, but when the parties started entering into alliances, smaller groups divided and started forming separate parties.”

“Another reason could be that most parties want to have a political affiliation because they all end up making alliances with bigger parties during elections,” added the senior leader from NSUI.

Besides the main organisations that have inhabited the campus since the 1990s, including National Students Union of India (NSUI), Students Organization of India (SOI), Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), Panjab University Students Union (PUSU) and Students Organisation of Panjab University (SOPU), there are 16 others that were launched in later years.

The organisations which have emerged in the last four years include Himachal Pradesh Students Union (HPSU), Himachal Pradesh Students Association (HPSA), All India Students Association (AISA), National Students Organisation of India (NSO), National Youth Association (NYA), Gandhi Group Students Union (GGSU), Pal Pehelwan Students Organisation (PPSO), Panjab University Helping Hands (PUHH) and Panjab Students Union (Lalkar).

Vikas from PUHH, said, “We launched our organisation last year, keeping in mind that we have to work only for students and not necessarily to win elections. It is the only organisation in which all the workers are currently students of PU. This organisation was an initiative of seven PU students.”

Two new student parties were launched this year, including PUSU for Students (PFS) and Independent Students Association (ISA).

Karan Randhawa, president of the newly launched organisation, ISA, echoed his opinion. “I never wanted to be part of the organisations, which acted like seasonal frogs since I worked throughout the year for students. I wanted to continue that, so I decided to form another group. Victory in elections is not the target; our work and dedication matters.”"
Greater Noida: 4 get life term for killing Italian company Graziano’s CEO in 2008,"Four workers were sentenced life imprisonment by the district and sessions court in Surajpur on Thursday for murder of managing director-cum-chief executive officer of an Italian multinational company — Graziano Trasmissioni — at Udyog Vihar in Greater Noida in 2008.

In 2008, Lalit Kishore Chaudhary, who was 44 then, was bludgeoned to death by 200 union workers after they were sacked from the company. The workers on September 22, 2008, had ransacked the company premises and broke down various cars.

Chaudhary, looking at the workers smashing the cars, came out of his office to pacify them. However, he was hit with hammers and sticks.

He was rushed to Kailash Hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.

Om Prakash Yadav, additional district government counsel said, “In this case, a chargesheet was filed against 75 persons for murder. They had trespassed and created riot like situation. It was a brutal murder.”

Additional district judge Ram Naresh Maurya awarded life sentence to four men, who have been identified as Rajinder Kumar, Mohinder Singh, Pankesh Kumar and Sajjan Kumar. They were also charged a fine of ₹3,000 each.

Two accused Ram Charan and Anwar were awarded three years of imprisonment. Other accused Labh Singh and Gurnam Singh were awarded one year imprisonment each. Yadav said that Rajinder and Mohinder were the main accused and have been in jail already.

Yadav said that 67 people have been acquitted in the case and that around 50 other employees were injured as workers went on vandalising the Indian unit of the Italian company. It created an environment of fear in Greater Noida.

Chaudhary was a resident of Punjab and was staying in Sector 30 of Noida. He is survived by his wife, Ratna, who was then a senior Physics lecturer at Delhi University’s Kirori Mal College. Their son was studying in Modern School, Barakhamba Road, Delhi.

Graziano Transmissioni was facing protests for several months in 2008.

After the incident, the then Union labour minister, Oscar Fernandes, had mentioned that the incident should serve as a warning for the managements. He had said that the workers should be dealt with compassion."
"Shikhar Dhawan’s ton, Axar Patel’s best helps India floor Sri Lanka in Dambulla","The Indian cricket team’s domination of Sri Lanka on the current tour has been so complete that the home team’s slim hopes of a turnaround rested on a change in format. (SL vs IND HIGHLIGHTS)

However, Sri Lanka spurned the opportunity with a sensational batting collapse that undermined the team’s first half-century opening stand of the tour as India crushed the hosts by nine wickets in the first One-day International at the Dambulla International Stadium. (SL vs IND LIVE SCORECARD)

Opener Shikhar Dhawan smashed his 11th One-day International century to leave Sri Lanka shattered. He led the team to victory in some style after left-arm Axar Patel grabbed a career-best haul of 3/34 in a seven-wicket show by spinners on Virat Kohli electing to bowl.

India dismissed Sri Lanka for 216 in 43.2 overs before racing to 220 for one in just 28.5 overs.

Shikhar, relentless against Sri Lanka on this tour after scoring 190 in the Galle Test and 119 in the final Test in Pallekele, scored an unbeaten 128, his sixth 50-plus ODI knock against the opposition. His domination spoilt veteran pacer Lasith Malinga’s 200th ODI.

Shikhar shared an unbroken 197-run second-wicket partnership with Kohli, who was unbeaten on 82 off 70 balls (10x4, 1x6) after Rohit Sharma was run out for four.

Shikhar reached his century in just 71 balls, and hit 20 fours and three sixes in his 90-ball effort.

Dickwella, who top scored with 64, and Gunathilaka (35) raised 74 in 14 overs as Sri Lanka looked like they would at least put up a decent fight for the first time on the tour.

However, Kohli used the spin of Axar, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and Kedar Jadhav to frustrate both, and the two in-form batsmen lost focus and it all came apart.

Kohli opened the bowling with Bhuvneshwar Kumar and all-rounder Hardik Pandya, and held back Jasprit Bumrah till later. Pandya pitched it up and gave away little.

If that was an experiment as India begin preparations for the 2019 World Cup, they had to fall back on old tactics, taking the pace off and the Sri Lankan batsmen caved in.

After a mix-up that almost led to a run out off the first ball of a Chahal over – the 14th – Gunathilaka failed to control a reverse hit to be caught at mid-on by KL Rahul off the last ball of that over. Jadhav then trapped Dickwella, who hit two centuries in the loss to Zimbabwe in the previous ODI series, with a faster delivery. A needless review didn’t help.

From 139 for one, Sri Lanka lost the next six wickets for 39 runs, the batsmen guilty of playing rash shots. The last nine wickets fell for 77 runs.

Kusal Mendis helped add 65 runs for the second wicket with Dickwella, but was bowled by Axar trying to whip to the on-side. New skipper Upul Tharanga played a shocker, lofting a full toss from Jadhav straight to long on.

Jadhav took 2/26 and Chahal, playing his first game for over a year, 2/60."
Cannes 2017: Now Godard reframed by The Artist director Michael Hazanavicius,"One remembers French director Michael Hazanavicius’s The Artist, a beautiful black and white portrait of the silent Hollywood. He has now returned to the Cannes Film Festival – six years later that is – with his yet another gripping work, Redoubtable. A wonderful tribute to Jean-Luc Godard, Redoubtable has been adapted from a biography of the celebrated auteur penned by his former wife, Anne Wiazemsky.

A still from Redoubtable.

Hazanavicius’ movie revolves around the time when Godard was helming what is famously known as his revolutionary work, La Chinoise. The time was 1967, a turbulent period in French history, which saw a workers’ demonstration followed by a serious student unrest.

As the Festival enters its sixth day on Monday, Redoubtable has been one of the few films that impressed this critic. It has been executed with remarkable finesse, has noteworthy performances and it narrates the story of a marriage gone sour at times when the French literary circles were driven by unending contradictions. Godard was an integral part of it.

What is the story all about? Godard’s short but passionate marriage to an actress – who later became a fiction writer -- Anne Wiazemsky. She was almost 20 years younger than Godard, and was everything that the man was not. He was brooding, critical, restrictively conservative when it came to her (there is a scene where he asks Anne not to do a movie because every scene has a nude shot of her’s and well, the poor director changes his script to have only the hero strip – a hilarious take that it then becomes) and so damn difficult when it came to other aspects of life and living.

In fact, much of the film is based on Anne’s biography, titled Un An Apres (One Year Later), and much of the celluloid work is seen from her point of view. She narrates much of it, indeed.

Godard was 37, and Anne barely 19, and the auteur was passing through a troublesome phase in his career. He was making La Chinoise, a movie influenced by Mao. She was acting in it, but when the the film runs into rough weather critically, Godard gets moody and irritable and argumentative. “Nobody can win an argument with you” says one of his friends.

The movie’s failure was followed by the unrest in 1968 – a year that saw Godard and his friends like Francois Truffaut storming the Cannes Film Festival and forcing it to pull its curtains down, One is told that Truffaut, who had been declared persona non-grant by the Festival because of his acerbic criticism of French cinema, sneaked into Cannes to cause mayhem. Both felt that Cannes should not run when there was so much suffering all around.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe.

At home, Godard was facing his own little tempest, and the relationship with Anne was hitting the rocks.

All this has been pictured most realistically – with a touch of wit and sarcasm (one often felt that the film was also an indictment of all things wrong with the French society then). We clearly see Godard’s fear of ageing , his nagging doubts about his own creative ability and his narcissistic tendencies. All these rob his life and marriage of peace – the political storm outside his home adding to his own disquiet.

Redoubtable is bound to do well in France and other parts of Europe. For much like Satyajit Ray and Tagore – who have been deeply ingrained in the psyche of an average Indian (certainly Bengali) – Godard and Truffaut will remain forever in these parts of the world.

And this is precisely what Hazanavicius told the media soon after his movie was screened on Saturday night. “Anybody making cinema today owes something to Jean-Luc Godard. He unlocked so many doors, created so many spaces and made cinema possible for many people”.

Anne’s account gives the movie a kind of rare insightfulness. “The intelligence of Anne Wiazemsky’s account lies in the way she manages to retain the aspect of an intimate diary. She doesn’t recount the story from the point of view of the woman she is now, but rather the woman she was then. There is a real Jean-Luc Godard who exists, but no one really knows him. My aim is not to create a carbon copy of Godard. I am inventing Jean-Luc Godard out of the Jean-Luc Godard created by Jean-Luc Godard. Anne Wiazemsky’s account is another variation of a Jean-Luc Godard also created by Jean-Luc Godard”, the director quipped.

Finally, one can say with a lot of conviction that Hazanavicius has managed to make a film on a subject as heavy as Godard with a breeze. Nowhere did this critic feel Redoubtable too heavy or languid. Rather, it was lighthearted and even funny. Not an easy task, though.

Janmashtami 2017: Actor Nitish Bharadwaj recollects his days from the Mahabharat,"If Krishna is usually cherished for his raas leela, then he’s also remembered for his sermon of Bhagvad Gita, and his significant role in the Mahabharata. Mention the classic TV series Mahabharat by BR Chopra and actor Nitish Bharadwaj’s strong portrayal, fluent dialogue delivery and impeccable body language comes to mind.

On the occasion of Janmashtami, the actor recollects that it was his knowledge that made him accept the offer of playing Krishna in the TV show. “My knowledge of the scriptures, Sanskrit language, reading of various analyses of Mahabharata from Marathi literature, and most importantly [it was] my mother’s faith in me that I can perform Krishna with all my strengths,” says Bharadwaj.

It isn’t, however, just the serious tales from the sets that remain afresh in his mind. He says, “It was day one of Roopa Ganguly’s shoot on the sets. Everyone was eager to meet her as the stories of her beauty had preceded her entry on the sets. I know of people who had planned to impress her. I was sitting in one corner, reading Osho’s book on Krishna. Roopa made the entry, met Ravi Chopra, Dharam Chopra (the DoP of the serial), saw me and came straight to sit with me and introduced herself. While she was telling me of a Bengali novel, she read about Draupadi and Krishna, almost the entire cast was green with envy or jealousy and were giving me dirty looks. I was greatly amused!”

The actor says that playing the character of Krishna on screen, changed him as an individual, off scren too. “It sensitised me to understand various aspects of Krishna’s persona, his beliefs and the virtues he stood for. But, it was the school of life, which took me on a roller coaster ride later, and taught me to apply Krishna’s principles to my life events. It’s the application of knowledge, which changes you as a human being. It is up to a man to choose to remain sane or go insane in times of distress,” he explains.

“Krishna is a timeless phenomenon. So, it is important to bring out the relevance of his philosophy in each era.” — Nitish Bharadwaj, actor

Krishna’s philosophies inspired Bharadwaj to the extent that when he was offered to re-enact the role for a Delhi group The Films and Theatre Society (FTS), he agreed “because the writer agreed to make the script relevant to today’s times. Krishna is a timeless phenomenon. So, it is important to bring out the relevance of his philosophy in each era.”

Today, when he performs in the Capital and his audience meets him backstage post performance, he feels elated: “I would be a hypocrite if say it doesn’t affect me. I love it. Artistes thrive on appreciation of work. But my thoughts at such moments are of gratitude to Lord Krishna, Maa Bhagawati and my parents. I am always humbled by people’s love and respect, and constantly remind myself of my social responsibility, which Krishna calls Loka Sangraha.”

And, what’s the relevance of Janmashtami in his life? “Janmashtami is the birth of every virtue that Krishna stood for — breaking the shackles of bondage, surviving in most adverse conditions, challenging the system if it is going wrong, establishing harmony in social order, justice, equality, uproot an obsolete and unfair political order to establish new ones wherein everyone has a voice, true meaning of submission to the Lord, Nishkaam Karma Yoga (dispassionate Karma), and the sense of duty with detachment. We must give birth to these virtues in our own heart and act in life proactively.”

MP: Fugitive ‘king of Dewas’ surrenders over farmer’s murder in 2015,"Vikram Singh Puar, the 27-year-old son of the deceased “king” of the former Dewas royals in Madhya Pradesh, surrendered on Wednesday after being on the run for more than a year for his suspected role in a murder.

He has been accused of leading a fatal clash with 12 armed supporters over a land dispute in Raghogarh village, about 40km from Dewas.

Puar and his gang allegedly tried to take away the wheat harvest of a farmer, Pratap Lodhi, on March 19, 2015. Lodhi and his family members resisted and, in the ensuing clash with firearms and lathis, the farmer was gravely wounded. He died on March 22.

The young former royal was on the run since then and a special court granted him anticipatory bail for 15 days in June 2016 as his father, former BJP minister Tukojirao Puar, was in his death bed.

His bail application was approved so that he could perform last rites of his father who died of brain haemorrhage on June 19. A day later, Puar was crowned “King of Dewas” at a private ceremony in the family’s palace.

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, home minister Babulal Gaur and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had attended the senior Puar’s funeral.

The new “king”, however, escaped and remained in hiding until he surrendered before a judicial magistrate on Wednesday.

Dewas police arrested Puar at a local hospital where he was admitted earlier in the day. The magistrate sent him to judicial custody till January 7.

Superintendent of police Shashikant Shukla said Puar’s police remand was not sought because “there was nothing to recover from him”.

But several questions remained unanswered: Where was the fugitive hiding? What was he doing? Who was he with? Who all helped him helped him during the period?

A murder charge has been registered at Barotha police station in Dewas after the farmer’s death. But a court acquitted 12 of the 13 accused last December, making the case weak against Puar, legal experts said.

Upul Tharanga evokes memories of Sri Lanka’s ICC Champions Trophy win over India,"Sri Lanka should look for positives from two months back rather than agonise over what went wrong in the last two weeks or so when they take on India in the first One-day International on Sunday, believes new skipper Upul Tharanga.

The seasoned left-handed batsman, who struggled in his traditional role as opener but will drop down to No 4 to boost the middle order, urged his players to forget the 0-3 drubbing at the hands of India in the just-ended Test series.

“We have been successful in the last decade. Unfortunately, we didn’t do well in the last 18-20 months. We have to be more consistent,” Tharanga told the pre-match media conference on Saturday at the Dambulla International Stadium.

ANGELO TO BOWL

Sri Lanka received a boost after it was confirmed that all-rounder Angelo Mathews, who quit as skipper following the shock defeat at home against Zimbabwe in the previous ODI series, was fit enough to bowl a few overs.

The middle-order batsman has avoided bowling since his return to the team following a calf injury. “We will play two seamers, and Angelo also might bowl a few overs. A few overs from him will give the side the balance,” said Tharanga.

Tharanga said he had told the players to focus on what happened in the ICC Champions Trophy, where Sri Lanka upset India in the group stages, although Virat Kohli’s team went on to qualify for the final. “We beat them in the Champions Trophy and that is a positive for us. We as a team can beat any team. As a captain, I will say that we must be consistent.”

He brushed aside suggestions that Sri Lanka could gain due to the absence of pace bowlers Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav, who have been rested for the series, apart from spinners R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.

“For India, Bhuvneshwar (Kumar), he is the No 1 in the side,” he said referring to the man who has emerged as one of the best death-over specialists in the game. “India have a very good bowling attack, especially everyone has played well in the IPL. We can’t underestimate them.”"

A decade of soaring Delhi University cutoffs,"If you scored less than 70% in Class 12, this year you have close to 26 options across Delhi University colleges. Only subjects offered — Hindi, Sanskrit and Urdu.

A decade ago, you had at least 120 — the options, slight more diverse, with subject choices such as History and Political Science as well.

As senior secondary board examinations across the country keep seeing rising scores due to moderation, Delhi University cutoffs keep increasing to accommodate only a limited number of students on the top.

While the Commerce courses have historically been in the 85+ bracket, the rise of Humanities has emerged only in the recent years. Today, courses like History and Political Science require as many marks as one would need for popular courses like Economics.

This year, over 60% of Delhi University cutoffs for the general category have crossed the 90% mark. In 2008, this figure was merely at 8%.

Volvo is owned by China’s Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd .

The Silicon Valley-based Nvidia also announced a non-exclusive partnership with German automotive suppliers ZF and Hella for artificial intelligence technology for autonomous driving.

Nvidia came to prominence in the gaming industry for designing graphics processing chips, but in recent years has been a key player in the automotive sector for providing the so-called “brain” of the autonomous vehicle.

The company, whose many partners already include Tesla Inc, Toyota Motor Corp and tier one supplier Robert Bosch, announced its latest deals at an automotive electronics show in Ludwigsburg, Germany.

Nvidia’s Drive PX artificial intelligence platform is used by Tesla in its Models S and X and upcoming Model 3 electric vehicles. Volkswagen AG’s Audi is also using the system to reach full autonomous driving by 2020.

In a call with reporters, Nvidia’s senior automotive director Danny Shapiro said carmakers and their main suppliers are now moving away from the research and development phase of autonomous vehicles and into concrete production plans.

The system developed jointly by ZF and Hella, and using Nvidia’s Drive PX platform, will combine front cameras with radar and software to create technology meeting the Euro NCAP safety certification for so-called “Level 3” driving, in which some, but not all, driving is performed by the car.

Volvo is already using the Drive PX for the self-driving cars in its “Drive Me” autonomous pilot program.

Volvo’s production vehicles built on Nvidia’s platform, as announced on Monday, are planned for sale by 2021."

Riding the horse of life to death: Vijay Nambisan (1963-2017),"In the early 1990s in Bombay, poetry, or prose for that matter, was not about getting prizes. Or even being recognized in a bookshop or a restaurant. It was a defiant and dangerous personal vocation. Something like the helpless inner voice that urges a prospective Christ to climb his cross as a matter of course, and drive the first nail with his free hand.

Poetry was a romantic, seemingly interminable act of self sacrifice. First it required a measure of self abuse. Then with luck words came. And they would sound real. For better or worse, that has changed . Writing is a career now. A performance. A mime of the self. A frantic if studied method to hang on to what may not be there anytime now: an award, a fellowship, a flung nickel, an air ticket. And it involves one of the most tiring tasks an intelligent human can embark on: self promotion.

Vijay Nambisan was capable of neither. In one of Vijay’s prose works, Language as Ethic, he argues from the heart—and shores up those arguments from his phenomenal intellect — that at the core of communication is not even words and images, but integrity. Devoid of it, language assumes a political and manipulative nature. On the surface of it, the premise sounds like the plea of an honest man to all to be good. But it explains, typical of Vijay’s work, as in a flash, why a whole culture is incapable of facing up to truth at just about every level. And a people’s proneness to collective delusions.

In the Bombay of the ‘90s there was a bunch of people from different generations who, more or less, spoke the then young Vijay’s alien language: poetry. Dom Moraes, Arun Kolatkar, Adil Jussawalla, Nissim Ezekiel, Eunice De Souza, Jeet Thayyil to name a few. In my perception, at that time, among the senior poets Dom was closer to youngsters like us than the others. Dom was particularly encouraging of Jeet, Vijay, and me, regular visitors to Dom’s residence in Sargent House, Allana Road, Colaba.

In the Bombay of the ‘90s there was a bunch of people from different generations – like writer-poet Dom Moraes (left) and publisher David Davidar– who, more or less, spoke the then young Vijay’s alien language: poetry.

Dom had written, perhaps excessively kind, introductions and blurbs for the three of us, and recommended us to David Davidar, who published the now landmark Penguin Gemini series. As far as I can recall — and there is not much I am able to forget — most of us were on some mood altering substance or the other most of the time, and had a certain contempt for what Vijay described as the Corporate Poet. And he did not mean just poet. He was against suits, boots, hats. And an equal measure of contempt for time; why else would we all try so desperately to fast-forward our clocks?

One of the accidental meeting points of the younger lot of poets was the Debonair magazine, whose office then was in Worli, housed in an unpretentious building. It would be always hot inside. And then there would be areas where it was wintry. The air conditioning was uneven. At the time, Anil Dharker was running it, and, like a classic literary editor, he was open to new writers. The poetry editor for a while, if I recall correctly, was Imtiaz Dharker.

When Dharker quit, Adil Jussawalla took over. It was at this time that I first met Vijay. I had gone there, mid-morning, to follow up on an article; Vijay was in Adil’s cabin. He saw me and came out, grinning like he had met a cousin long lost. We went down to the bar round the corner and had a few. Sometime in the twilight hours, we parted, and all I could take away from that meeting was that I was supposed to meet him the next morning, at his paying guest room, close by.

I went, nursing the by now familiar hangover, and knocked on the door. Vijay opened it, but his face had undergone drastic restructuring. The night before he had fallen flat down the stairs on his chin, and was lighter for three or four teeth. There was blood on the stairs. I went back, in search of phantoms similar to Vijay. But could not find too many — even over the years.

I mention these details of the inner workings in the literary alleys of Bombay of that rather unchronicled decade because Vijay stuck to that life, took several more falls. Lost more than his teeth.

The others moved on or tried to move from that unforgiving, transgressive life, in which words had to be bought with a little bit of life in exchange, an unsustainable trade.

Vijay bought into solitude, sometimes hating it, sometimes, choice-less, loving it. It gave him, I imagine, a martyr’s identity. He was the knight of poetry, and he was going to ride the horse of life to death. The smarter among his friends veered away from that track.

Through it all, Vijay wrote. Not much, but a little that said a lot. For him it was hard to separate a way of living from a way of writing. To create, he had to destroy. And his own body seemed the closest at hand.

He knew what he was doing. And, to me, it felt like a kind of vengeance. I was not sure vengeance against what. Most likely against himself. Between suicide and murder, he would choose the first. He knew his ways of life hurt people who loved him the most; his family; his very caring wife, Dr Kaveri Nambisan, a fine novelist herself. A few times, he went off alcohol; but he unerringly came back to, as he puts in a different contest, in Reminders of Gain : The call of the arrow/Summons the bow//

There are the usual articles doing the rounds that Vijay was a recluse. That word is a much-prostituted one in literary descriptions because it is used as if reclusion is a kind of extreme glamour of the eccentric. But then this is a place where the press described him as “the first all India poetry champion in 1988.”

The truth was that Vijay was dysfunctional. The only place he could be himself and find a transcendental value was in the world of words. He was close to a few people. That kept shifting. For a while, or so I think, he was quite my comrade in arms; in alms, too. The early years in Bombay for instance. Then we drifted. In his later phase, he was perhaps close to Jeet.

Vijay Nambisan was close to poet and writer Jeet Thayil. (Pradeep Gaur/Mint)

In between, I moved to Pune to head the Times of India’s edition there. Vijay and Kaveri had taken up a house in Lonavla, where he said the “clouds passed through his head, if he opened the window.” I never did make it to Lonavla.

In the car from office to my house once, Vijay said, “You have become a different man.” All the while I wondered how to tuck him in bed, given his slightly accusatory mood. This was around the time he had done a rare, cadenced translation of selected portions of Poonthanam’s Jnana Paana, (Song of Wisdom).

Poonthanam was a great 16th century Bhakti poet who more or less wrote the rules of the Malayalam language and literature. He was a devotee of Krishna, especially after the accidental death of his infant child. Poothanam’s rival in Krishna bhakti was Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri, a rather superior — he was one of India’s first astronomers, and he was a great mathematician and linguist as well — brahmin who wrote, Narayaneeyam in Sanskrit. Poothanam’s work made literature accessible to the Malayalee non-brahmin. One of the great questions in Malayalam literature has been: Which work is better? Or which works better?

When Vijay said he was going to translate these ancient poets to English, I remember asking him, who’s going to read it. Vijay asked for some salt. Because he sweated a lot, he would mix salt in alcohol. It was all quite scientific at one level. I got him salt. He blew some smoke in my direction and grinned his famous grin. He didn’t care. That’s what he meant. The market did not enter into the world of his words. His integrity was a voice that he could ever rely on to impel him to triumphs and disasters.

Later, he said the translation was no easy job. Though Vijay, like quite a few IIT-ians, had a photographic memory, he was not fluent in reading or writing Malayalam, even though he asserted his provenance and ethnicity wherever possible.

What he did was to ask his father — who, when I met him once at his home in Bangalore, seemed both proud and worried about his prodigal son — for literal translations and then trans-created it beautifully into rhythmic wisdom.

Consider the opening lines of his work: “O yesterday the things we did not know would come!/And O the things we do not know will come today!/Now we behold those soon pass away!/ We are not told how long they’ll stay with us”.

There is a touch of Hamlet here: “There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come. If it be not to come, it will be now. If it be not now, yet it will come — the readiness is all.”

At the time when the book came out, it was mostly criticized for his self-confessed ignorance of the vernacular, and his own agnosticism. To my mind, it was a spectacular act of literary courage, though not easy to distinguish from self indulgence, and dare.

Through it all Vijay drank. Went into detox. Came out. Wrote. Smoked. He smoked, I had often thought, as an antidote to alcohol. It was a break from what he was doing to his liver. For this, he had to destroy his throat and lungs. Either way, he would pay a price.

He paid it. Because the rest of the world of his 90s had changed. They had become gentrified. All the more reason he had to stay the course. He was the last man standing. What he thought of the change he said a few years ago in Outlook: “Eighteen of the happiest months in my life were spent in rural Bihar. It may sound like reverse snobbery, but I can’t help that. My wife and I were honoured members of the community, no one tried or wanted to shoot us, and the nuns looked after us like friends. What more could we want? A Learjet?”

This was the stay that went into the writing of his funny and insightful work: Bihar is in the Eye of the Beholder. It explained, as perhaps only a poet could, the intricate workings of a place that failed to work. And still survived like a trick that explained the tawdry magic of India. This book too was commissioned by David Davidar of Penguin, with whom Vijay had a productive relationship.

That’s saying a lot. Vijay’s ties changed with the tides of his mind. People betrayed him, by just not calling him up. In his mind, and I believe he is right, he was one of the few genuine artistes who deserved recognition, but would do nothing outside the covers of his books, to wangle it.

His latest collection, which was released last year, First Infinities, has some remarkable poems. It was perhaps justly brought out by an alternative publishing house, Hemant Diwate’s Poetrywala. Some of the poems suffer from a certain vulnerability to fall into the rhymes and rhythms, which take the poet away from the place he intended to end up in when he set out. But more often than not, the music ends in notes you did not think resided in them. It’s only the fine permutation of the words that makes possible a beauty which was not there till Vijay thought it up:

Snow

Crisp in the winter’s morning,

Softly all through the night,

What is this without warning,

Falling and white?

I have never seen snow

But I can imagine it quite –

Not how it tastes, but I know

It falls and is white.

One morning I’ll open the door

To bring in the morning’s milk,

And all around there’ll be snow –

Fallen and still.

How I’ll roll in the stuff!

How I’ll tumble and spin!

Until the neighbours cry, Enough!

And send me back in.

These are times when people die to live. Vijay lived to die. And write. I am glad I walked part of the way with him. He was the light. And he burnt furiously while he was there.

"THE CLASS OF 2018: When parents are short on time and money, kids struggle in school","""Every time a parent asks how the student is doing, they do better,"" says Sanu. ""As SMC members, we have a direct channel with their teachers, too. So kids know that we are not only reliant on their words to know how they are performing. I can easily ask their teachers."" Both Sanu and Devi agreed that getting to know teachers cultivates in their children a certain sort of productive ""fear"".

As the education levels of Chandrashekhar's children has surpassed his own, he says he has become less involved in their lives.

Where Sanu and Devi are assertive, Chandrashekhar is diffident. ""My kids are more educated than me now,"" he says. ""How do I help them out at home? All I do is ask them once in a while how they are doing at school, if they have done their homework. That is all.""

Yet Chandrashekhar's son, Arvind, who is in Class 9 at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, says he benefits from personal attention from his father. ""When my father asks me about school, it makes me feel like he cares. It matters what I do and how I perform in school. I think I work extra hard on the days he asks.""

Saransh Vaswani, the co founder of Saajha, a not for profit organisation that works to enable parents to participate in the learning of their children and the School Management Committees, confirms that frequent interactions between parents and students are crucial — no matter how educated the parents are.

""It's okay if you are not literate,"" he says. ""You could interact with your child while you are cooking, talk to them about shapes and colours. We have even given parents and students simple worksheets to fill out together. Simple things like, match the 'ba' with 'batak'.""

But like Chandrashekhar, his wife, Vimala Devi, and his other child, Jyoti, 21, also work long hours at intensive jobs, leaving them with only so much time and energy to interact with the Nikki and Arvind afterward. Vimala Devi and Jyoti each work at a garment factory in Okhla. Vimala Devi makes Rs. 6,000 a month; Jyoti makes Rs. 7,000. They work from 8am until 8pm most days, leaving Nikki to do household chores in addition to their schoolwork.

""I come back late from work. I don't even have time to ask about her studies sometimes,"" says Vimala Devi of Nikki.

Vimala Devi passed through only eighth grade; Chandrashekhar didn't make it past Class 5. Jyoti, who makes a strong effort to help her siblings, had to quit school during Class 8.

Jyoti's foreshortened time in school was a direct result of her family's poverty. She now plays the role of a surrogate parent to her siblings.

The end of a dream

Jyoti's foreshortened time in school was a direct result of her family's poverty.

""I always wanted to study and become 'something', 'someone',"" she recollects. ""From the seventh grade, I knew I wanted to become a doctor. My mom used to fall ill often, you see? So I wanted to treat her.""

This dream ended in 2008 when her father fell ill with multiple masses in his kidneys. She was in seventh grade. The family had to leave their small village in Uttar Pradesh for Delhi so that her father could seek treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

""When we moved to Delhi, we soon realised that we could not afford the expenses if I did not work too,"" says Jyoti. She joined her mother at a factory making, she says, ""chamkeeli things"", shiny trinkets that were decorated with small mirrors and sequins.

""I remember having to beg her boss to give me a job as well,"" says Jyoti. ""I was not 14 yet, so it was illegal to employ me. Saab finally relented and allowed me to work there, helping with some of the handiwork, for around Rs. 1,200 per month. They used to make me hide in boxes or send me out to play at the time of inspections.""

Though the new job meant that Jyoti could support her parents and siblings, it also meant that she would never become a doctor.

""Now I try to live out my dreams by playing a doctor at home when somebody falls ill,"" Jyoti says. ""Even when neighbours fall ill, I talk to the doctors about it and then prescribe the medicines they suggest.""

Though many parents realize that education is central to the future success of their kids, it is a long-term investment with no immediate returns.

The financial straits of Chandrashekhar's family is typical of other families in the pahadi school. The average household income is about Rs.10,000 to Rs. 20,000 a month, according to Sonu Nijhawan, the vice principal.

Teachers say they regularly see how the academic futures of their students are thwarted by the poverty of their families.

""One instance that I will never forget is that of Madhu,"" says Neelam Sanjeeta Minj, the teacher who is in charge of the school's management committee. ""One of our bright students, though she had only secured a 68% in her tenth grade. Her family was originally from a village in Rajasthan, and her father worked as a halwai here in Delhi. She had to discontinue her studies and go back to her village because her father was not earning enough to sustain a family here in Delhi. I still remember her crying.""

Much though many parents realise that education is central to the future success of their kids, it is a long-term investment with no immediate returns. For poorer families, it often must be sacrificed.

""I keep telling Nikki to study,"" Jyoti says. ""I even ask her to not do the household work. I say I will make dinner after I get home; I usually ask her to make use of the time to study.""

Wondering about the future

""Hum toh padh nahin paye, humare bache to padhe (We were not able to study, but we would like our kids to study)."" This belief, according to Minj, is the driving force behind many success stories of kids whose ""stubborn"" parents insisted they get an education.

Jyoti is largely uneducated herself, works a difficult job, and comes home exhausted. Still, she has intuited what Minj learned from experience, and is determined, as a kind of surrogate parent, to provide her siblings with the unflagging attention and support that they need.

""I keep telling Nikki to study,"" she says. ""I even ask her to not do the household work. I say I will make dinner after I get home; I usually ask her to make use of the time to study... I sometimes yell at them when I see them squander away the opportunity given to them by goofing around. You are allowed to play, of course, but you need to study.""

Nikki dreams of teaching Hindi someday, and regularly practises by helping classmates with their homework. If she succeeds in becoming a teacher, it would radically change her family's circumstances.

Nikki has noticed her sister's efforts. ""'Padhle (study) Nikki, padhle.' This is something you will hear often in this house,"" she says. She dreams of teaching Hindi someday, and regularly practises by helping classmates with their homework. If Nikki succeeds in becoming a teacher, it would radically change her family's circumstances. A senior secondary school teacher in Delhi government schools can make as much as Rs. 55,000 a month.

Nikki's teachers say that she is receiving high marks, but getting that job at a government school wouldn't be easy: she'd have to complete an MA and BEd in Hindi and pass an additional set of tests even to be considered.

Jyoti has devoted herself to the difficult task of supporting the education of her siblings. But she is also acutely aware of how different Nikki's future might be different from her own. The eldest child wonders what her life would have been like if she hadn't dropped out of school.

""My siblings, especially the youngest brother, call me uneducated at times,"" Jyoti says. ""It is usually when I insist he go finish his homework or schoolwork. But when he calls me 'unpadh', I get angry, upset, all at once. I sometimes take it out on my parents. I ask them why they let their other kids study, but did not send me to school. I know it was not a choice they were happy making. It was something they were forced to do. But sometimes, I ask anyway."""
Almost one cow-related attack every week in 2017 thus far,"In the 33rd week of 2017, India reported its 30th incident of cow-related violence in the country–the most in eight years–in the West Chamaparan district of Bihar where seven Muslims were attacked by cow vigilantes for allegedly eating beef in their homes, the IndiaSpend database of such violence shows. So far we have recorded 75 incidents of bovine-related violence across India since 2010.

On Thursday, August 17, 2017, a mob of over 50 people gathered outside the house of Mohammad Shahabuddin in Dumra village, shouting slogans of ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’, the New Indian Express reported on August 18, 2017. The vigilantes, which included local members of the right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad group, reportedly accused Shahabuddin and his neighbours of killing a cow and consuming beef. The mob reportedly locked the Muslims in a room in Shahabuddin’s house and beat them up with wooden sticks. Four people were injured in the attack and hospitalised thereafter, the newspaper report said.

While no charges were filed against the attackers, the local police arrested seven Muslims for “deliberately hurting the religious sentiments of the local majority community”. Explaining why no action had been taken against the attackers, the police said: “There has been no such complaint about the attack so far,” the New Indian Express reported.

This is the second attack to take place in Bihar within a fortnight, and the third attack reported in the state this year. Prior to 2017, Bihar did not report a single attack for at least seven years since 2010–the start point for the IndiaSpenddatabase of such violence.

Created through a collection and content analysis of reports in the English media, the shows that 97% (73 of 75) of such incidents were reported after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government came to power in May 2014. The data show that Muslims were the target of 56% (42 of 75) cases of violence centred on bovine issues over nearly eight years (2010 to 2017) and comprised 86% (24 of 28) killed in 75 incidents.

More than half or 53% of the cow-related violence–40 of 75 cases–were from states governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), when the attacks were reported, revealed our analysis of violence recorded until August 18, 2017.

The recent two cases of cow-related violence in Bihar are recorded under the Janata Dal (United) government. On July 27, 2017, the JD(U) entered into an alliance with the BJP.

"Maharashtra CM vows stable govt till 2019, Shiv Sena tries to unsettle it","A day after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis dismissed the possibility of the BJP-led Maharashtra government becoming unstable in an apparent dig at the Shiv Sena, the Sena stepped up its aggression, targeting the government on a range of issues from the farm loan waiver to the country’s security.

After the party’s internal meeting at its headquarters, Shiv Sena Bhavan, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said, “On the one hand, we are hearing about the number of farmers who have so far applied and been declared eligible for a loan waiver, and on the other hand we are hearing that a large number of farmers having committed suicide. Why are farmers committing suicide if the government is really trying to help them? This should be clarified. Assure us that farmers are really being made debt-free.”

He reiterated his demand of getting a full list of all 89 lakh farmers who are to benefit from the BJP-led government’s promised Rs34,022-crore loan waiver, along with their addresses. Thackeray also criticised Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who left the post of the defence minister earlier this year, to take charge of the government at Goa, for reportedly saying he would go back to the Union defence ministry if the BJP loses an upcoming by-election in Goa. “Amid clouds of war with China on one side and Pakistan on the other, it is treachery with the country if he is making such statements and playing with the defence ministry, jumping from the Centre to the state depending on whether the party wins certain elections,” Thackeray said.

He also said his party has started preparations for the next election and hopes to at least double its strength of elected representatives. The party currently has 63 legislators in the state assembly and 18 parliamentarians. He appointed Sena MP Sanjay Raut to lead preparations in North Maharashtra, Diwakar Raote in Vidarbha, Subhash Desai in the Konkan region, Ramdas Kadam in Marathwada and Gajanan Kirtikar in the Satara, Sangli and Solapur districts.

At the BJP’s executive body meeting on Thursday, Fadnavis sent a loud and clear message that he will stay as the chief minister and dismissed any concerns of there being instability in the government, assuring that the next election will not be before 2019."
"Chinese automaker SAIC announces India entry, will start making cars in 2019","SAIC Motor Corporation Ltd on Wednesday announced plans to enter India and start manufacturing cars by 2019, becoming the first Chinese automaker to venture in what will be the world’s third biggest auto market by 2020.

SAIC, formerly Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, will start making cars at its fully-owned manufacturing facility by 2019. SAIC is still negotiating to take over the General Motors’ Halol factory which closed operations on April 28 this year.

In India, SAIC has already registered its local subsidiary, MG Motors India. The company has roped in former GM India executives to lead its India operations -- Rajeev Chhaba will be president and managing director while P Balendran will be the executive director.

The largest automobile company in China stands 46th in the Fortune Global 500 list, with annual revenue of over $100 billion. The state-owned automaker has joint ventures in China with Detroit-headquartered GM and Germany’s Volkswagen, with brands such as MG, Roewe and Maxus under its belt.

Outside China, SAIC is present in several global markets including UK, USA, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Middle East, South East Asia, Thailand and Indonesia. It even has an ‘Overseas Innovation Center’ in Silicon Valley, California.

What models will SAIC bring to India under the MG badge remains a mystery. Founded in 1924, the Morris Garage has seen several change of hands before China’s Nanjing Automobile Group acquired it in 2005. It came under the SAIC umbrella after SAIC merged with Nanjing in 2008.

“The introduction of the iconic British Sports Car Brand ‘MG’ in India is an important part of SAIC Motor’s global strategy. Our aim is to provide best-in-class vehicles, integrating sophisticated British design and quality, breakthrough product features and a pleasing ownership experience,” the company said in a statement.

“As a new-age auto company focused on innovation and technology, the company offers various solutions and technological capabilities required in the development of ‘new energy vehicles’, to cater to the changing needs of global customers and the overall ecosystem,” the statement added."
Qatar says ‘no delays’ on 2022 FIFA World Cup despite political and economic crisis,"Doha, Aug 20, 2017 (AFP) - Qatar’s 2022 World Cup preparations have been inconvenienced but not delayed by the political and economic boycott by its neighbours, the country’s most senior tournament organiser insisted Sunday.

Hassan Al-Thawadi, Secretary General the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, said alternative suppliers outside those countries involved in the ongoing dispute have been found for tournament-related construction projects.

“The impact has been minimal,” Thawadi told Doha-based broadcaster Al-Jazeera English in an interview to be aired later on Sunday.

“In terms of stadium progress or stadium construction and infrastructure requirements for the World Cup, progress is being made as well.”

READ | Jese hits ground running as Stoke City shoot down Arsenal

He added that the crisis has “caused an inconvenience”.

Asked outright if projects had been delayed, Thawadi responded: “Projects are on schedule. No delays have occurred.”

Qatar has been isolated since June 5 when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut ties with the World Cup host -- accusing it of backing extremism and fostering ties with Iran -- triggering the biggest political crisis in the Gulf for several years.

Doha denies the claims.

Qatar initially gave priority to Gulf suppliers for the vast construction projects -- the country is spending $500m a week on World Cup projects -- accompanying the controversial tournament.

Since the conflict began some have questioned whether the gas-rich emirate can subsequently meet deadlines to build or renovate the eight stadiums currently earmarked for 2022.

But Doha has said it swiftly replaced Saudi and UAE companies with Chinese and Malaysian contractors, among others, since June 5.

Qatar is soon expected to unveil its latest designs for further stadiums.

Since winning the 2022 bid seven years ago, Qatar has been dogged by controversy over allegations of corruption to secure the tournament and the abuse of workers building stadiums, claims which it denies."
"The Big Sick movie review: Kumail Nanjiani, Anupam Kher star in the must-see rom-com of 2017","That two people could overcome centuries-old cultural obstacles, the perils of modern dating and a critical illness and end up together is a great story. That those two people also managed to adapt their own great story into a great movie is a miracle.

It’s the wonder of The Big Sick , the must-see romantic comedy of the year. Sweet-natured, funny and genuine, you’re not likely to have a more pleasant time at the cinema this summer.

At the centre is Kumail Nanjiani, the deft comedian who audiences might know from HBO’s Silicon Valley. He actually uses his full, real name in the film, which he co-wrote with his wife, Emily Gordon and based on their wild courtship. Emily has ceded her part to an actor, Zoe Kazan, who continues her very persuasive campaign to be the rom-com dream girl for those who fancy themselves better than rom-coms.

Kumail is a struggling stand-up comedian who pays the rent for his awful Chicago apartment by driving for Uber. When he’s not on the stage, or in the car, he’s at home with his family in the suburbs. They’re Pakistani and Muslim and have all had arranged marriages and expect Kumail to do the same. He’s managed to live a bit of a double life for a while - dating who he wants while also holding up the pretense of being a good Pakistani son. But everything changes when he meets Emily, the white grad student who he falls for and then loses when she realizes that he’s been hiding her from his family.

To be fair, they would literally disown him if he chose Emily over the scores of Pakistani ladies that “just drop by” their family dinners like clockwork, headshot and bio in hand. So Emily and Kumail break up. They have to. It’s a standard rom-com beat and obstacle. But then something happens: Kumail gets the call that Emily has been hospitalized, and the movie pivots into something entirely different and infinitely richer than most in the genre.

Suddenly he’s the one making the call to put her in a medically induced coma while also informing her parents, Terry and Beth (Ray Romano and Holly Hunter) of their daughter’s health turn. Beth is none too happy to have her daughter’s ex-boyfriend lurking around during their family crisis, either. Hunter plays Beth, at first, with that scary and all too recognizable indifference of a mother who doesn’t care to humour the man who hurt her daughter. But, like everything, that evolves.

One of the really wonderful and telling things about The Big Sick is how fleshed out the world is around Kumail and Emily - from Kumail’s comedy friends (Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant and Kurt Braunohler), to his family (Anupam Kher, Zenobia Shroff, Adeel Akhtar and Shenaz Treasury) and Emily’s parents, no supporting character is made into a caricature. Even the potential wives are given distinct and memorable personalities. Their presence is mined for comedy, but the women aren’t punchlines. It’s a delicate balance that The Big Sick gets just right.

If there is anything to pick on, it’s that we never get to know Emily as well as Kumail. It’s not her fault, she’s in a coma for most of the film, and we get a fair amount of colour at the beginning, but her arc leaves a bit to be desired.

Michael Showalter’s direction isn’t flashy or stylish, either. His camera is there in service of the story and the characters and it doesn’t get in the way.

Some stories are too good to be true, and some true stories are too good for the movies. Luckily for us, The Big Sick is neither.

Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”,"Play with the Swachh Bharat rankings and make your city “cleaner”

The government’s rankings of the cleanest cities in the country, released last week as part of the Swachh Bharat campaign, had some surprising outcomes. “Is Varanasi really cleaner than Bhubaneswar?” my editor asked in an article earlier this week. Others have asked some version of the same question: How were these rankings produced? And is the methodology sound? The rankings consider three broad categories of data: documentation provided by civic authorities, feedback from citizens, and independent ground assessments. Intuitively, one might think that the ground assessments — which involve unbiased people observing how clean the city actually is — would be the most important source of data. But the way the Ministry of Urban Development calculated the rankings, ground assessments are the least important. Instead, 45% of the ranking comes from documentation provided by the cities, 30% comes from citizen feedback, and the remaining 25% is derived from the ground assessments. What if these categories were weighted differently? We’ve built a tool that lets you find out. Adjust the weights of the three categories below, and see how the rankings change.

Use the white handles to adjust the weights. Documentation Ground assessment Citizen feedback

Or, use these buttons.

Reset Documentation only Ground assessment only Citizen feedback only All three are equal

View chart City Your rank Gov't rank Change in rank Each dot represents a city or civic authority. Hover over a dot for details. Scores get higher with your weights or lower with your weights.

So what if we scrap the documentation and citizen feedback, instead relying entirely on the ground assessment? Bhopal rises to the top of the list, while Indore falls to 11th. Varanasi actually improves, rising from 32nd to 28th, while Bhubaneswar improves from 94th to 70th, still far behind. If we only consider citizen feedback, Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh, rises from 136th to the top of the charts. Apparently, Neemuch’s citizens think their city is very clean, even if the government and independent assessors disagree. And if only documentation matters, Chandigarh becomes the country’s cleanest city, rising from its former rank of 11th. Why did the government choose to weight documentation so heavily? “In initial years, you have to push municipalities to do work,” said Quality Council of India’s Anay Agarwal, who directed the survey project. “Even if results are not visible on the ground, they have to be awarded — in terms of higher ranking — for starting the work.“ In other words, by weighting the rankings as it does, the government wants to encourage cities to demonstrate an institutional commitment to staying clean. By this thinking, cities that provide documentation of their clean-up efforts demonstrate a commitment to the process, even if the results have yet to show up on the ground.

Sri Lanka face uphill task for direct qualification for 2019 World Cup,"Sri Lanka face an uphill task of sealing direct qualification for the ICC World Cup 2019 as they prepare to take on India in a five-match ODI series beginning in Dambulla on Sunday.

The Upul Tharanga-led side will have to win at least two matches in order to secure a place in the 2019 edition by staving off the challenge from the West Indies. The cut-off date for direct qualification is September 30.

Sri Lanka is currently placed eighth with 88 points but have a 10 point cushion over the West Indies, who have an unenviable task of being among the seven top-ranked sides apart from host England to gain direct qualification.

The bottom four sides on the ODI Team Rankings will need to play a qualifying event also featuring the top four sides from the ICC World Cricket League Championship and top two sides from the ICC World Cricket League. The top two teams from this event will get to play in the World Cup 2019.

Winning two matches will take Sri Lanka to 90 points while West Indies will at best reach 88 points even if it wins its one-off ODI against Ireland on September 13 as well as all five matches of its series in England from September 19-29.

However, a 4-1 win for the Men in Blue will see Sri Lanka finish at 88 points and The Windies could edge it on decimal points if it wins all its upcoming six matches.

The West Indies will go out of contention if it loses to Ireland as from there it will at best reach 86 points and remain behind Sri Lanka on decimal points, even if Sri Lanka loses 5-0 to India.

As for India, which is in third position with 114 points, only a 4-1 series win will ensure it stays ahead of England. Even a 3-2 win for India will mean it will slip to 113 points and behind England on decimal points owing to Sri Lanka?s low ranking.

Scenarios

India wins 5-0: India 117 points; Sri Lanka 86 points.

India wins 4-1: India 115 points, Sri Lanka 88 points.

India wins 3-2: India 113 points, Sri Lanka 90 points.

Sri Lanka wins 3-2: India 111 points, Sri Lanka 91 points.

Sri Lanka wins 4-1: India 109 points, Sri Lanka 93 points.

Sri Lanka wins 5-0: India 106 points, Sri Lanka 94 points."
Virat Kohli says Mission 2019 Cricket World Cup starts in Sri Lanka,"Virat Kohli declared that the clock will start ticking in the build-up to the 2019 World Cup when India begin the One-day International series against Sri Lanka at the Dumbulla International Stadium on Sunday.

India, ranked No 3 in the ICC ODI list, will look to add to their dominance over Sri Lanka, having achieved a 3-0 Test series sweep. Sri Lanka also upset India in the early stages of the ICC Champions Trophy in June, but Virat Kohli had his sights set on the big prize.

“See, for us it’s about time frame, it’s not about which opposition we are playing,” Kohli told a pre-match media conference on Saturday. “You can’t pick and choose, I have never believed in that and we as a team don’t believe in that.

“Two years to go, almost 24 months to go for the World Cup and now is the time to give players certain roles to get into the groove and understand what we need to do in reaching that World Cup final. For us, it’s all about when you want to start, giving roles to players, experimenting as a team.”

The India skipper confirmed KL Rahul would bat at No 4 while acknowledged that it was a challenge for Ajinkya Rahane. The top Test batsman’s ODI future hangs in the balance.

He hardly played in the Champions Trophy as Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma opened and then was Man-of-the-Series in the West Indies with Rohit rested.

Kohli hinted Rahane or Manish Pandey may have to sit out. That could mean Kedar Jadhav gets a go.

“In any format, if you have any kind of desperation or urge to cement your place or perform so to say, there is always going to be a bit of pressure on you. See, it’s a pecking order that you need to look at. Shikhar, who was not even in the mix of things till a few months back, when he comes back you see what he can do.

“So, it becomes very difficult for you to understand, what do you do in that situation because he came back and scored in the Champions Trophy. He continued his form in the Test series and won you two Tests.

“Jinks (Rahane) understands that at this stage he is the third opener in the team, we certainly back him because he has been shifted around a bit in the batting order, which is not healthy for a guy who likes to open in the shorter format,” he said, adding that Rahane was more relaxed after clicking in the Caribbean.

The key to India doing well consistently was to try new things.

“Sometimes we get so carried away by Team India’s expectations that you have to win every game that we don’t follow a pattern.”

Kohli said India are likely to pick only two spinners from left-armers Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel while hinting leg-spinner Yuzhvendra Chahal could play.

He was confident India had the core set for the World Cup.

READ | India look to extend dominance over Sri Lanka in ODI series

“The core has always been good. We have players who have the ability to strike 200, and players who have the ability to play for 35 overs in a one-day game. It all depends on what you decide to do as a team and then move forward in that direction. Everyone is ready to take those challenges up, they’re ready to embrace them, and that I think is the most exciting part.

“If we can embrace trying out a few difficult things and being uncomfortable, then it’ll help our cricket grow even further. If you see the way we’re playing Test cricket right now, we’re almost getting 400 in a day, which we haven’t done on many occasions…”"

Hyundai Motor to launch electric vehicle with 500 km range after 2021,"Hyundai Motor Co said on Thursday it will launch a long-range electric vehicle with a driving range of 500 km (311 miles) per charge after 2021, seeking to address investor concerns that it is lagging rivals in the green car race.

The automaker and affiliate Kia Motors Corp, which together rank fifth in global vehicle sales, also said they are planning 31 eco-friendly models by 2020, up from a previously flagged 28.

The new additions include three plug-in hybrid vehicles, which come on top of eight battery-powered cars and two fuel-cell vehicles.

Battery-powered cars offered by the likes of Tesla are gaining traction faster than fuel cell vehicles backed by Hyundai and Toyota Motor Corp.

Last year, Hyundai launched its first mass-market pure electric car IONIQ, but the vehicle’s per-charge driving range is much shorter than offerings from Tesla and GM.

The automaker said will introduce an electric version of its Kona small sport utility vehicle (SUV) with a driving range of 390 km in the first half of next year.

It also confirmed a Reuters report that it is developing its first dedicated electric vehicle platform, which will allow the company to produce multiple models with longer driving ranges.

Hyundai unveiled a near production version of its new fuel cell SUV with a driving range of more than 800 km per charge under European standards, nearly double the 415 km for its current Tucson fuel cell SUV.

The mid-sized SUV will be launched in Korea early next year, followed by US and European markets.

A fuel cell electric bus is slated to be unveiled late this year, while a sedan-type fuel cell car is also planned."
La Liga 2017/18: 5 new signings to watch out for,"The Spanish league lost Neymar in a record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain but still has plenty of star players on display, including the two touted as the best in the world — Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Barcelona also kept Luis Suarez, Real Madrid held on to Gareth Bale, and Atletico Madrid still has Antoine Griezmann.

The top three teams did not make any blockbuster additions, but some talented players will keep the Spanish league attractive.

Here are some of the players worth watching in Spain when the league kicks off Friday:

Gerard Deulofeu

A product of Barcelona’s youth academy, Deulofeu is expected to take over Neymar’s spot in Barcelona’s attack along with Messi and Suarez.

The 23-year-old Spaniard was bought back from Everton, which he had joined in 2015 after failing to make an impact with Barcelona’s first team.

🔊 Deulofeu: ""I feel good and I have trained hard for the last two weeks to get fit."" #FCBlive pic.twitter.com/Rxs1jos42t — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) August 4, 2017

He had spent seasons on loan at Everton (2013-14) and Sevilla (2014-15) before being bought by the English club.

Deulofeu spent the second half of last season on loan at AC Milan, scoring four league goals in 17 games.

He played well enough to convince Barcelona to activate its re-signing clause and bring back the forward, who can play on either flank.

Manuel ‘Nolito’ Agudo

The veteran forward is back in Spain after a short stint with Manchester City last season.

Nolito signed with Sevilla and will reunite with manager Eduardo Berizzo, who coached him for two seasons at Celta Vigo.

The 30-year-old Nolito replaces Victor “Vitolo” Machin, who transferred to Atletico Madrid.

PRESS CONFERENCE l Castro: ""#SevillaFC made an effort to sign Nolito, but so did he to come here""

Nolito, who played briefly for Barcelona in the early 2010s, was a member of Spain’s squad at the 2016 European Championship in France.

Spaniard winger Jesus Navas is also moving from City to Sevilla, returning to the team he played until 2013. Sevilla also added Colombian forward Luis Muriel, who was with Sampdoria.

Paulinho

The 29-year-old Brazilian midfielder was Barcelona’s first signing after Neymar’s departure, arriving on a four-year contract in a transfer worth 40 million euros ($47 million).

A regular in Brazil’s national team, Paulinho played for Tottenham for two seasons before moving to Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande in 2015.

The versatile midfielder thrived with Brazilian club Corinthians before moving to the Premier League, standing out for his prowess as a defensive midfielder and his ability to help out in attack.

His signing came as a surprise to many because of his age and because he is not known for playing the ball-possession game characteristic of Barcelona.

Paulinho is expected to fight for a starting spot with Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic.

The Catalan club also reinforced its defense by signing 23-year-old right back Nelson Semedo, the former Benfica player who was in Portugal’s squad at this year’s Confederations Cup.

Victor ‘Vitolo’ Machin

Vitolo was signed by Atletico Madrid but will spend the first six months of his new contract playing for boyhood club Las Palmas in the Canary Islands.

Atletico is not allowed to register any new players until 2018 because of a FIFA-imposed ban for having broken rules regarding the transfer of underage players. Coach Diego Simeone will only be able to count on the former Sevilla forward as from January.

Vitolo: ""Estoy muy feliz por volver a casa"".https://t.co/BqENfYmnXl pic.twitter.com/VxY8JR6DYt — UD Las Palmas (@UDLP_Oficial) July 13, 2017

The 27-year-old Vitolo was part of Las Palmas’ youth program before joining Sevilla in 2013. He helped the southern Spanish club win three Europa League titles from 2014-16 and has been capped 11 times by Spain, scoring four goals.

Theo Hernandez

The 19-year-old French left back was in the center of a dispute between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid, choosing European champions Real instead of the team where he played most of his youth.

Atletico said Hernandez rejected several of its offers to renew his contract, which ran until 2021.

Hernandez impressed last season while playing for newly promoted Spanish club Alaves on loan from Atletico. Alaves finished ninth in the Spanish league and reached the Copa del Rey final, which they lost to Barcelona.

Hernandez will likely have to fight for a starting spot with veteran Marcelo at Real, where he will be coached by countryman Zinedine Zidane.

Madrid also secured the signing of 21-year-old Dani Ceballos, the former Real Betis midfielder who was named the best player at the Under-21 European Championship this year. Madrid also bought 20-year-old center half Jesus Vallejo, who was on loan at Eintracht Frankfurt last season."
India vs Sri Lanka: Can Virat Kohli break his record of ODI tons vs SL? 5 key battles,"Virat Kohli-led India will hope to complete their terrific run down south when they take on Sri Lanka in a five-match ODI series, starting August 20. The visitors won the Test series 3-0.

(Read | This day, that chair: Virat Kohli finds his debut ‘seat’ ahead of Dambulla ODI)

Sri Lanka are currently ranked eighth in the ICC ODI rankings and need to win at least two matches to earn a direct qualification for the 2019 World Cup. Even a single victory might seal the deal for them as the West Indies, the only other contenders for the spot, would then have to win their one-off tie against Ireland and all the five matches against England.

(Read | India hit high notes on fitness ahead of ODI cricket series against Sri Lanka)

However, given the kind of situation the team is in at the moment, the islanders would not just want to earn direct qualification, but would also look to put up a better show compared to what transpired in the three-Test series. Here’s look at the five key battles to watch out for -

Virat Kohli vs Lasith Malinga

The clash between the two prolific cricketers will be an interesting one to watch out for. Kohli, who scored a century in the first Test, would want to have a few knocks to show for as his three other innings accounted for just 58 runs. Malinga, on the other hand, is an experienced customer who knows exactly what the Indian skipper has up his sleeves.

(Read | MS Dhoni faces acid test in Sri Lanka ODI series with eye on 2019 ICC World Cup)

Kusal Mendis vs Bhuvneshwar Kumar

The performance put up by the home team in the Test series was nothing but shambolic. Yet, there were a few positives for them in the name of Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne. Mendis struck a fantastic ton in the second innings of the Colombo Test, albeit his side was trailing by 439 runs.

Kusal Mendis (L) would like to continue his splendid form but Bhuvneshwar Kumar, for sure, will have other ideas. (HT Photo )

The islanders would hope that he continues to play in the same manner but the Indians will be aware that he has a particular weakness against pacers and has fallen to them on four of the last six occasions. With Bhuvneshwar Kumar having the ability to swing it both ways, it might not be an easy task for the Sri Lankan No. 3.

Angelo Mathews vs Hardik Pandya

Both all-rounders Angelo Mathews (L) and Hardik Pandya will hold the key to their team’s chances. (HT Photo )

Both of them bat lower down the order, come in as the first change in bowling and have often been handed over the duty to bowl at the death. Hardik Pandya, who recently struck his maiden hundred in Test cricket, would want to build on his role as a handy all-rounder while Angelo Mathews would be well aware of the kind of responsibility he has to shoulder for the team.

Upul Tharanga vs Kuldeep Yadav

Kuldeep Yadav (R) will be in no mood to allow Upul Tharanga to be in his comfort zone. (HT Photo )

With five wickets in his debut Test on foreign soil, Kuldeep Yadav would be booming with confidence as he heads into the ODI series. With Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja being rested, Kuldeep should be an easy pick for the selectors. With his natural ability of taking the ball away from left-handed batsmen, Sri Lanka skipper Upul Tharanga might face a tough time facing the 22-year-old.

Shikhar Dhawan vs Lakshan Sandakan

In his last five knocks against Sri Lanka, Shikhar Dhawan has notched up three centuries — two in the recently concluded Test series and the other in the Champions Trophy clash. Dhawan has been in a superb form since the Indian Premier League (IPL) and would look to continue to bat in the same manner. However, he would try and avoid facing Lakshan Sandakan, who has the knack of troubling left-handed batsmen."

Okja movie review: The first great film of 2017 has arrived. Protect it fiercely. 5 stars,"Okja

Director - Bong Joon-ho

Cast - Ahn Seo-hyun, Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Steven Yeun, Lily Collins

Rating - 5/5

If getting booed at the Cannes Film Festival is considered a badge of honour, it is a badge Okja must wear with pride.

It joins a list of films – a list that will probably have you performing an almost comical double-take in a moment – that for various bizarre reasons, found themselves at the receiving end of the famously snooty French crowd’s ire.

In ’76, it was Martin Scorsese’s bleak and brutal Taxi Driver. In ’94, it was Quentin Tarantino’s cultural watershed Pulp Fiction. And in 2011, it was Terrence Malick’s masterpiece, The Tree of Life. Each of these classics was heckled at their Cannes screenings. And each of these films, despite the heckling, won the festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or.

In 2017, the honour (the booing, but sadly not the Palme) went to Okja, the new film by cult South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho – although for reasons we’ve never heard before. Despite ending with one of the most unexpectedly forceful tonal shifts in recent memory – the film goes from being a magical, Miyazaki-esque fable, to a horrifying skewering of mankind in the space of 30 minutes – the most controversial moment in Okja’s Cannes premiere came before it even began. When the Netflix logo ‘duh-dum-ed’ its way onto the screen, the old-school crowd let its disapproval (and fear of the future) be known. Critic David Ehrlich, tweeting from inside the Palais, described it as a ‘prison riot environment.’

It’s natural, as spoiled, needy human beings, for us to want better, never satisfied with what we have. Similarly, it is natural, while the glorious Okja unfolds before your eyes, to wonder just how different it would be on a big screen. Would it be better? Would it be worse? Would the lush Korean landscapes be more breathtaking? Or would the cracks in the CGI be more visible?

Tilda Swinton as Lucy Mirando in OKJA

We will never know. And that is OK. Because despite making the cardinal sin of not being made available to your local multiplex, Okja does what most event movies and summer blockbusters, proudly shot in IMAX, can’t. It cares about its characters, its tone, its craft, and it has enough confidence in you, the audience, to stick with it, even when it becomes too challenging, and even when the mirror it holds up to your face reveals all the blemishes you’ve been trying to hide.

Its story begins several years ago, in a colourful prologue. Tilda Swinton plays the CEO of a powerful multi-national corporation, who, with great fanfare, announces the discovery of a new pig-like creature that her company will breed, and then ship off to 26 far-flung corners of the world, to live with local farmers.

10 years later, in a remote mountain-top farm in South Korea, one of the creatures, now grown up, bounds across the gorgeous countryside, a young girl by its side. She is Mija, the granddaughter of one of the farmers chosen to care for the animal, and she has named it, also a girl, Okja. This is their world. It is all they have. And it is all they need.

Wordlessly, with the aid of some truly wonderful creature design and visual effects, Bong conveys the essence of his film these opening scenes. It is a story about nature and nurture. It is a story about being an innocent child trapped in a harsh world run by adults who’ve been ruined by it, by greed, and by success.

But above all else, it is a story about the evil of mankind, and the depths to which we are capable of sinking. Much like his previous movie, the monumentally underrated Snowpiercer (another film in which he gave Tilda Swinton a memorably despicable character to play), Okja, too is a science fiction story, just as nihilistic, just as furious at our hypocrisy, and just as unforgettable.

OKJA

Like Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel Maus, it addresses real-life horrors by replacing images seared into our minds with fantasy, with animals, and with humour.

And fantasy is what Mija needs, when one day, a sweaty, moustachioed, obnoxious American hikes up to her farm. He is Dr Johnny Wilcox, employee of the Tilda Swinton’s MNC, played by a screechingly over-the-top Jake Gyllenhaal, who comes bearing terrible news. In one fell swoop, he destroys Mija’s world. He has come to take Okja away from her.

Jake Gyllenhaal as Dr. Johnny Wilcox in Okja.

Mija’s grandfather, a poor farmer, has already made the deal. It’ll keep food on their bellies. Perhaps it’ll pay for her education too. He’s only coming through the promise he made to her dead parents. He’s taking care of their daughter.

But Mija isn’t the sort of girl to take injustice lying down. She isn’t the sort of girl to resign herself to her fate – or to let Okja fall prey to hers. She packs a bag, breaks open her piggy bank, and journeys across the world to New York, where she plans to break into the headquarters of the Mirando Corporation, and rescue Okja.

Along the way, she is joined by members of the ALF (Animal Liberation Front), played by Paul Dano, Lilly Collins and Steven Yeun, who, despite having their own twisted agenda, are the closest the film comes to having decent people (besides Mija, of course).

OKJA

In a fair world, Okja would have the power to make even the most belligerent meat eaters consider vegetarianism. It would make us question the truths we ignorantly accept. It would make us seek answers, challenge the consumerist culture we so blindly embrace. It would inspire change. But – and Okja would be the first to remind us of this – the world is hardly a fair place.

As an animal lover, I wouldn’t wish the very particular emotional jolt this movie delivers on my worst enemy. Be warned: There is very little hope here. There is only bleakness. But there’s no turning away from Okja. We must spread word about it. We must champion it. Because it is the first great film of 2017.

"With pastures for cattle shrinking, India may have to import milk by 2021","India may have to import milk in four years, if it cannot increase fodder supply for its 299 million cattle, as rising pressure on land reduces pastures nationwide.

Spurred by rising incomes, a growing population and changing food preferences, the demand for milk and milk products will grow to at least 210 million tonnes by 2021–22, a rise of 36% over five years, according to government estimates. To meet this demand, production must grow by 5.5% per annum, according to the State of India’s Livelihood (SOIL) report. In 2014-15 and 2015-16, milk production grew at 6.2% and 6.3%, respectively.

To boost milk yield, India would need to generate 1,764 million tonnes of fodder by 2020, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of government data. But existing sources can only manage about 900 million tonnes of fodder–a shortage of 49%.

Demand for private consumption has risen from 5% per annum in the period 1998-2005 to 8.5% per annum between 2005 and 2012, according to an Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, report.

This demand and supply gap has pushed up milk prices by an average of 16% per annum, according to the according to the 2015 SOIL report.

States with top milk yields have more pastures

In the decade to 2015, milk production went up 59% from 92 million tonnes to 146 million tonnes in 2015. But fodder shortages may knock India off its position as the world’s top milk producer (it contributes nearly 17% of global production).

The milk productivity of India’s livestock is less than half (48%) of the global average: 987 kg per lactation compared to the global average of 2,038 kg per lactation.

The availability and quality of fodder has a direct bearing on the quantity and quality of milk productivity, the data show. All the three states that topped milk productivity in terms of gram per day–Rajasthan (704), Haryana (877) and Punjab (1,032)–had earmarked more than 10% of their cultivable land for pastures, according to the 2015 SOIL report. The national average is 337.

Currently, all three types of fodder are in short supply–green (63%), dry (24%) and concentrates (76%). Only 4% of total cultivable land in India is used for fodder production, a proportion that has remained stagnant for the last four decades.

Demand And Supply Of Fodder: An Estimate

Considering the demand for milk, land under fodder production needs to be doubled, according to this December 2016 report of the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture.

Shortages are forcing states to now source fodder from elsewhere. “The quality of fodder is a concern. We are now looking to source fodder from Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh),” said Sudhir Mishra, who runs a dairy farm in Ranchi (Jharkhand).

But major portions of grazing lands have either been degraded or encroached upon, according to the Parliamentary Committee report.

However, the availability of crop residues, the largest single source of fodder, has been impacted by increasing pressure on land and the replacement of traditional cereal crops, especially coarse ones. Crop residue includes coarse and fine straws, leguminous and pulses straws.

Given the importance of food and cash crops, it is very unlikely that the area under fodder cultivation will increase substantially, the parliamentary committee report said.

“If India fails to achieve substantial production growth, the country would need to resort to significant imports from the world market which has the potential to cause prices to spurt since India is a large consumer,” said 2015 SOIL report.

To cut costs, easy access to fodder is important for small farmers

Feed cost constitutes about 60-70% of operating expenses on dairy farms. Nearly 70% of India’s milk production comes from small and marginal farmers, who depend on homegrown fodder. Unlike big operators like Mishra, they cannot afford to buy fodder from other states.

Take the case of Dundappa Patil, a 10th-class pass from Belagavi in North Karnataka, who took a loan of Rs 35,000 for dairy farming eight years ago.

The process of applying and getting a loan for the enterprise was simple and quick because Patil was covered by a scheme for unemployed youth in Karnataka. He went through a crash course in dairy farming in Belagavi and in less than a month, set up business with four buffalo.

Patil’s target was to sell 20 litres of milk every day to a local co-operative society. But the yield per buffalo on Patil’s farm was less than 2 litres a day; his buffalo produced less than half the milk he hoped they would.

“I realised that just buying a good buffalo was not enough, quality and quantity of fodder too had to be good,” he said. “You have to be ready to spend a lot of time and money on sourcing fodder.”

Patil said he and other villagers were using a common pasture on a hill 5 km from the village. “But that is seasonal and not enough for the all the village cattle,” he said.

So, he tried buying the fodder, but then the business did not look viable.

The contribution of livestock to the incomes of landless and small farmers ranges between 20-50%, and the poorer the family, the greater the potential of dairy farming’s contribution to livelihood, according to the SOIL report.

Unlike agriculture, which tends to be seasonal, dairy farming provides returns through the year. It can minimise the risks agricultural households face when they run short of cash.

In Belgavi, that scenario did not work for Patil because he could not overcome the fodder shortage–an issue India must address if it is to be self-sufficient in milk and dairy farming is to succeed.

Eventually, after a year, Patil sold the buffalo and repaid half the loan. The bank waived the rest after failing to recover it. Today, he is a construction worker in Belagavi city.

Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina were reportedly omitted for the India-Sri Lanka series as they didn’t meet the high fitness standards set and coach Ravi Shastri has said agility will be the key going forward.

“When the time comes for India to field a side for the 2019 50-over World Cup, we should have the best fielding XI in the world. Only the fittest of the lot will survive and thrive going forward and that’s right up there in the list of priorities.”

Batsman Manish Pandey, fresh from leading India A to the Tri-series win in South Africa, is confident India would come on top in the limited-overs series as well.

“A couple of things we have in our favour, we whitewashed them in the Test series, so they might be a little down. But this is where we have to focus and keep playing our cricket well, and do our basics right. If we do that we are hoping to have a good one-day series too.”

But the team’s focus on Friday was on fitness rather than tactical discussions.

“We had a meeting and spoke about it (fitness) for an hour and everybody is happy with it. From the senior-most guy, MS Dhoni, to the junior-most Kuldeep Yadav, everybody is happy (about pushing fitness levels). If it is an advantage for me, I would love to take it up and work hard.

Asked about the routine of Kohli and Rahul after the batting nets, he said: “Everybody has their own thing to do, individual warm-up and training, whatever helps to take our game to the next level. This is what we do the whole year; it’s not just the cricket we play. The test we have, at least twice a year, we all prepare for that as well.”"
MS Dhoni faces acid test in Sri Lanka ODI series with eye on 2019 ICC World Cup,"The lion may be the king of jungle, but elephants rule in the forests around the central Sri Lankan town of Dambulla, where the buoyant Indian cricket team starts a five-match One-Day International series against a struggling Sri Lanka on Sunday.

READ | Why MS Dhoni may not make it to 2019 Cricket World Cup

Drivers taking certain stretches around Dambulla in the night have eyes peeled for the big boys who sometimes decide to take over the roads.

For Virat Kohli’s One-Day International squad, the series will start in earnest the build-up to the 2019 ICC World Cup in England and Wales, which is less than 24 months away. And all eyes will be on former skipper MS Dhoni, especially after chief selector MSK Prasad’s recent comments left an elephant-in-the-room tone.

Under pressure

The suggestion by MSK Prasad, a former India wicketkeeper himself, that Dhoni, 36, will be in contention for the championship he won as skipper in 2011 only if he delivers consistently has put pressure on the senior-most member of the side.

“We don’t say it is automatic, this thing… but we will see. We are all stakeholders. We all want the Indian team to do well. If he is delivering, why not? If he is not, we will have to look at alternatives,” Prasad said.

The statement has brought extra pressure on a vital member of the squad building up for the 2019 World Cup, although MS Dhoni will be 38 when it comes around.

Prasad’s comments have caused confusion because there are no issues about Dhoni’s fitness as of now, his keeping remains sharp while vital inputs to Virat Kohli, who took over from him in January, from behind the stumps have been acknowledged by the skipper. Where MS Dhoni has been found wanting is in his famed role as a finisher.

Build-up time

However, the team composition does not reflect MSK Prasad’s comments. There is no second wicketkeeper with youngster Rishabh Pant, doing duty for India A in South Africa, not picked for this series.

READ | Virat Kohli continues to top ICC ODI rankings for batsmen

India are unlikely to play more than 30 One-Day Internationals between now and the 2019 ICC World Cup, which has a May start. That means the national selectors face the challenge of giving MS Dhoni – his India appearances are limited --- enough games and at the same time stick to their rotation policy.

The national selectors have slotted KL Rahul to bat at No 4. That leaves either the technically proficient, who is also the most versatile batsman after Virat Kohli, to take over at the top if Shikhar Dhawan or Rohit Sharma suffer a dip. Even Ajinkya Rahane, who finds his spot shaky, can step in if required.

However, India’s top-order is likely to be tested only while playing overseas, not in the sub-continent. And that is where MS Dhoni will also be required to marshal the middle-order batting, where Kedar Jadhav or young all-rounder Hardik Pandya don’t have the experience to handle pressure, like ‘Mr Cool’ has down the years.

As of now, that appears the only box India would like to tick early in the World Cup build-up.

Familiar turf

Dhoni has seldom revealed his emotions, though he has acknowledged he is no longer the finisher of old. And his tortuous 54 off 114 balls, in the loss to West Indies at North Sound, Antigua in a 11-run defeat soon after the ICC Champions Trophy will keep experts wondering whether he will be a force when the 2019 ICC World Cup comes around.

However, India’s double World Cup-winning skipper can look forward returning to Dambulla. The last time India played here was in 2010, and Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan helped Sri Lanka extend their record against India here 7-4. Dhoni alone showed resistance, and was the only India batsman to get a half-century in that defeat."

India look to extend dominance over Sri Lanka in ODI series,"India openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma will reunite at the top as Virat Kohli’s side aims to repeat its dominance over Sri Lanka in the five-match One-day International series starting at the Dambulla International Stadium on Sunday.

India, the No 3 team in the ICC ODI rankings, will have a point to prove after Sri Lanka upstaged them in the group stages of the ICC Champions Trophy, where the hosts were still eliminated while India finished runners-up.

READ | KL Rahul looks to cash in on season of fresh starts under ‘inspiration’ Virat Kohli

Dhawan and Rohit have been the vital aspect of India’s ODI campaigns for a while, but their century partnership in that match against Sri Lanka did not prove enough.

Tough times

Sri Lankan cricket is passing through dire times, and new skipper Upul Tharanga, who stuggled in the Test series, will have his task cut out. The former winners, currently ranked eighth, must win at least two matches to finish among the top-eight teams in the ICC rankings ahead of the September 30 cut-off for a direct entry to the 2019 World Cup.

The depth in the Indian batting has left even a player of Ajinkya Rahane’s quality without a guarantee he will play. With KL Rahul assured of the No 4 slot, Rahane will hope to get the nod ahead of Manish Pandey – in-form and a brilliant fielder – as well as Kedar Jadhav – a big-hitter who can also bowl spin.

With the vice-captaincy going to Rohit, Rahane, India’s key middle-order batsman in Tests who sat out most of the ICC Champions Trophy games but was the highest scorer in the West Indies series that followed, is no certainty in the eleven.

Hungry bunch

All-rounder Hardik Pandya, who made a splash in the Test series with a racy debut century in the Pallekele victory, and chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav will look to extend their fine form.

With Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav as well as R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja not playing, the likes of Axar Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal can hope to get a look-in alongside Shardul Thakur, the 25-year-old Mumbai pacer who is yet to play for India.

Sri Lanka will be boosted by the experienced Lasith Malinga, but will have to bat far better than they did in the Test series to make it an even contest and ensure they don’t have to fight the qualification battle for the World Cup spot.

Kusal Perera and Dhanushka Gunathilaka, whose half-centuries helped Sri Lanka upstage India in the Champions Trophy, as well as Angelo Mathews, who gave up captaincy after the humiliating home ODI series loss to Zimbabwe, will have to come good.

The Indian bowling attack will be eager, and will be backed by the new-found intensity for fielding. However, Sri Lanka have had the upper hand at Dumbulla, where they hold a 7-4 win-loss record."
"Maharashtra: Two men fall into a 2000-feet deep valley, video captures fall","Two revellers died after falling into a 2,000 feet deep valley in Amboli Ghat in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra.

A video of their fall has gone viral on social media, even as their bodies are yet to be recovered.

The incident took place at Kawale Saad Point in Amboli Ghat, a popular picnic point, on August 1, police said.

“Imran Garadi (26) and Pratap Rathod (21), who were part of a group of seven, fell into the valley. Their bodies are yet to be recovered,” said Sunil Dhanawade, Senior Police Inspector of Sawantwadi police station.

The victims and their friends worked at a poultry farm in Kolhapur, he said.

While others left the Kawale Saad Point after spending some time, Garadi and Rathod lingered back. When they didn’t join the group, their friends approached Sawantwadi police.

Police found out about the mishap from local people and shopkeepers, and roped in trekkers of Hill Riders Group to search for the duo.

The bodies were spotted down in the valley, but were yet to be recovered as heavy rain, water cascading down the hill and mist made the operation difficult, the officer said.

The video which is circulating on social media shows the two men, bottles in hand, climbing the fence around the edge of the valley and backtracking once or twice. Then the two are seen standing on the edge, beyond the fence, and slipping down."
Independence Day 2017: 5 tips that promise you freedom from everyday tech nightmares,"India is today celebrating its 70th Independence Day. The country is en route to a technology revolution wherein everything is becoming digital and is accessible on-the-go. From peer-to-peer money transfers to watching movies, technology has indeed helped improve our productivity. Even as users like you and me are becoming more used to a ‘smarter’ lifestyle, there are still some tiny yet persistent problems that slow you down. Come India’s 70th Independence Day, let’s use these simple steps to make our lives digitally smarter.

Pesky calls, texts

Who doesn’t get annoyed by calls from unknown numbers offering new schemes? Funny thing, all these pesky calls come especially when you are middle of something important. Well, we all have faced it. Fortunately, there are a few workarounds.

One of the first things you might want to do is getting registered to Telecom Regulatory authority of India’s (TRAI) National Do Not Call Registry (NDNC) aka Do Not Disturb (DND). In order to get your number on the DND list, you need to send an SMS ‘START 0’ to 1909 or you can simply make a call at toll-free number 1909.

Users receive an SMS informing about registration in the NDNC. Do note that DND activation takes up to 2-3 days. You can check the status of your DND registration in the NDNC list by clicking here.

You can also use the TRAI service for getting rid of pesky SMSes. The regulator has divided the promotional messages in primarily seven categories – banking, real estate, education, health, consumer goods and automobiles, entertainment and tourism. To block SMS from, say banking, send an SMS “STOP 1” to 1909.

If you are an Android user, you also have the option to download TRAI’s DND app from Google Play store.

Registering on the DND list may filter out a lot of pesky calls and texts, but you think it’s still paltry, you may give a shot at Truecaller app. Available for both Android and iOS, Truecaller allows users to see live caller ID and identify unknown calls, block spam SMS and calls. TrueCaller works better on Android than iOS.

Battery life

There are a very few smartphones that can actually run an entire day. A lot of us are usually scrambling for a charging port or a charger by end of the day. One of the easiest ways is to simply carry a portable powerbank. There are tones of affordable power banks available online. For an example, I use Xiaomi’s 10,000mAh portable charger, which is available online for Rs 1,199.

The Xiaomi Mi Powerbank is business card sized. (Xiaomi )

In case you are not carrying a powerbank or intend to buy one, you can still optimise the battery life of your smartphone through a few simple tricks. Before we elaborate, Android users can go to Settings> Battery > Use any of the battery modes depending upon your requirements. Nowadays, most of the Android phones come with a dedicated battery optimisation mode that help elongate battery life of the smartphone. Apple iPhone users can also do the same by going to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode.

In order to draw more juice from the battery, you can try out following things:

1 Disable location, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and data

2 Reduce the screen brightness to minimum

3 Deactivate apps that have been set to auto-sync or always on

4 Kill the background apps

5 Airplane mode (will disable cellular connectivity)

Documents organisation

For a lot of works including some government applications, a scanned copy is necessary. Not all of us have scanners at home. Well, even if some of us do, we cannot carry our scanners all the time. For an example, I had to send scanned copies of offer letter, appointment letter and relieving letter to my new employer. While I had the hard copy of those documents, the scanner at my office wasn’t working. So here’s what I did.

I downloaded the HP Smart app, which actually allows me to remotely control my Wi-Fi enabled printer/scanner/copier at my home. While one can remotely send command to the printer to scan the copy, one can also click a photo of the document through the smartphone camera, save it as PDF (a more accepted form of scanned documents) or .JPEG image. The documents can be arranged, renamed and shared it over the email, Google Drive and social networking apps like WhatsApp and Messenger. You can also try out Adobe Scan app for iOS and Android.

Some of the smartphones, like Gionee’s, come preloaded with a Document mode within the camera app as well.

Limited phone storage

You may think limited phone storage is a third-world problem or of those having lower-end phones. Well, you’re right, mostly. I use an iPhone 6 16GB model and most of the time its storage is almost full. I plead guilty for not deleting a lot of older photos, and even my iCloud photos backup has ran out of the storage. Well, Google Photos is the best option available at the moment.

Available for both Android and iOS, the Google Photos app allows you to back up your photos, access on-the-go and the best thing is you get unlimited storage if you choose the option to compress photos to 16-megapixel. Videos that are higher than 1080p resolution will be resized 1080p. You can check your Google storage plan here.

Google lets you back up unlimited photos and videos for free in ‘High Quality’. (Google)

Besides Google Photos, you can always use apps like Apple iCloud Library, Amazon Photos, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox among others to backup your data.

In order to further optimize the space on your Android smartphone, you can try out Lite versions of the apps like Facebook, Twitter, Skype, Flipkart, Snapdeal and LinkedIn. Of course, the experience is not on par with the main versions of the app, but these Lite apps work well on lower-end phones and slower 2G data network.

If you like to listen to music a lot on-the-go but face the problem of limited storage on the smartphone, I’d recommend you stream music from apps like Saavn and Gaana. These apps allow you to save the music and listen later offline. A paid subscription should not hurt much, I assume. Or, you can simply use YouTube’s offline feature.

While iPhone users don’t have the luxury of microSD cards, Android users, on the other hand, can very well use them to optimise built-in storage on the smartphone. If your smartphone runs on Android Marshmallow and above, you can use microSD card as an internal storage. Once you insert a microSD card, you will get two options -- use microSD card as internal storage and use microSD as portable storage. Choose the former. Do note, not all the smartphone brands allow using microSD as internal storage.

Email clutter

If you are a professional or student, emails are pretty much part of your day-to-day routine. But of course not all the emails need to be seen immediately or responded. While Google and Microsoft do a pretty decent job at categorising the emails for your, still you will need to do a bit more with them.

Google’s Inbox is a pretty decent service that helps improve productivity. The service shows you highlights instantly without needing to dig through emails, add reminders to the top of your inbox and even set snooze emails reminders that should come back to your inbox whenever you want. One of the best things is it allows you to bundle group messages and get rid of the clutter. You can also further customise the bundle by grouping emails from social network, promotions, purchases, and so on.

If your Gmail storage is full, you can delete emails containing heavy files with this simple process – just enter has:attachment larger:1M to search for emails that contain files more than 1MB in size. You can also narrow down the search to specific date and even larger files if you want. Don’t forget to clean your trash folder for Gmail to reflect your actual storage."
THE CLASS OF 2018: Why doesn't this co-ed school have any girl students?,"The Government Co-education Secondary School in Naya Bazaar, is 'co-ed' only in name. In the seven years since the school moved into its new building, a girl is yet to seek admission.

Co-education schools are a rarity in Delhi's government school system, accounting for a mere 17 per cent of the city's 1,009 schools in 2015. Most of the remaining schools are run in two shifts, where girls study in the morning and boys in the afternoon.

Educationists are increasingly convinced of the importance of boys and girls studying together from a young age; particularly in a city like Delhi where violence against women is common, and most young men and women live in gender-segregated spaces.

""Any project where homogeneity is brought about artificially can never prepare students for challenges they will face in society,"" said Minati Panda, chairperson of Zakir Husain Center for Educational Studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.

So why don't girls study at the Naya Bazaar school?

The history of this school building offers an insight into not just the constraints of Delhi's school system, but a perspective on how girls and young women are pushed out of public spaces almost by default.

The building at Naya Bazaar began as a government girls school. But in 2004, the building was closed for repairs and the students and staff were shifted to the Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Pul Bangash.

In 2009, a co-ed school in the Bara Hindu Rao neighbourhood had to be moved to make way for flyover.

""I am not sure what happened to the girl students in Bara Hindu Rao, but when I came here in 2012, the school already had only boys as students,"" said Gauri Shankar, the principal at Naya Bazaar.

The gender balance, Shankar said is further skewed by the fact that three of Naya Bazaar's feeder schools are boys school at the primary level. ""We are ready to give admission to girls but most of them go to Pul Bangash school as this school is in the middle of market area.""

Now, no parent wants their girls to go to a school full of boys.

""I didn't know if Rahul's school was co-ed,"" said Pawan Gautam, whose son studies at the school, ""There are no girls in his school, so I didn't want to send my daughters there.""

Only 17% of Delhi's 1009 are co-educational by default, rather than design.

Why so many single-sex schools?

Most of Delhi's schools are single sex by default rather than design. The primary reason, officials from the department of education said, is this allows the department to run two schools from the same building.

""The population of Delhi has increased many-fold, and we have to create opportunities for these students,"" said Saumya Gupta, director education. ""Girls go the morning shift as you can't ask parents to send girls in the evening, and boys come in the evening.""

Officials said many parents prefer to send their daughters to a girls' school.

""Most of our schools are decades old and maybe at that time locals demanded their daughters to be sent to a girls school,"" said an official, who did not wish to be named. ""Such local conditions still exist in certain areas although we need to break these stereotypes.""

Yet, graduates from these schools wish for a more liberal education.

Amit Kumar, who studied at Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Sangam Vihar, said he struggled to adjust at a co-ed college.

""I had almost negligible interaction with girls,"" he said. ""When I moved to college, it was a different world where boys and girls studied in the same classroom.""

""It was difficult to adjust and interact with the girls. Maybe if I was from a co-ed school it would have been easier to adjust.""

Experts agree.

""It is desirable to have co-education so that students can learn to engage with the opposite sex in a natural way while they are growing up,"" said Poonam Batra, a professor at the Delhi University's education department.

A 2014 study published in the journal 'Sex Roles', found that teachers in single-sex school tended to rationalise segregated schools on the basis that girls and boys learn differently, thereby perpetuating gender stereotypes.

The Department of Education insists that change is around the corner.

""We are opening 16 new schools in this academic session and all are co-ed,"" said Gupta, the education director.

But for now, Naya Bazar, the co-ed school that never had any girls, is being turned into a boys school, perpetuating a cycle that everyone in the department says they want to break out of."

A week of upsets at Wimbledon may signal the end of an era,"Rafael Nadal’s dreams of a third Wimbledon title were shattered on Monday when he lost in the fourth round to 26th-ranked Gilles Muller. Then, on Wednesday, two more former champions and tournament favourites – Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic – went down to lower ranked players (Sam Querrey and Thomas Berdych, respectively). Murray and Djokovic were both thwarted by injuries, and Nadal, famous for his seemingly endless reserve of stamina, succumbed in the 28th game of the fifth set. Taken together, the three upsets – each one against a former champion now in his 30’s – may signal the coming of an end of an era in men’s tennis. To be sure, three upsets do not make a trend. And Roger Federer, the oldest of the Big 4, may yet manage to win his record eighth Wimbledon on Sunday. But a trove of data, compiled by sports statistician Jeff Sackman, also suggests that the previous decade of men’s tennis – characterized by a handful of top players’ domination of the field – may be very different from the years to come.

Upsets in Grand Slams In 2003, a 21-year-old Roger Federer won his first Wimbledon title. The intervening years have been marked by near total dominance in the men’s field, with four players – Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray – winning 48 of the 56 Grand Slam tournaments. If it has been one of the greatest eras of men’s tennis, it has also been one of its most predictable. Since Federer first became Wimbledon champion, upsets have become increasingly rare in the men’s field. If we define an upset as a match in which the winner’s rank was at least 10 lower than the loser’s, we find that the frequency of Grand Slam upsets dropped from about 26% in 2003 to about 21% in 2016. Every year since 1991, upsets on the men’s side were more common on the women’s side. But in 2008, men’s upsets finally became less common than women’s, and have remained so ever since.

Federer wins his first Wimbledon 2009

Wawrinka wins Aus, French and US Open Men Women Year Upsets %

While it is possible that the trend will continue into the future, it is at least as likely that the coming years will see a regression to the mean. That is particularly true because the men who have dominated tennis for the last several years are getting too old to keep winning all the time.

Tennis is old The Big 4 have been dominating men's tennis for more than 10 years now. The youngest of the four is Novak Djokovic, who turned 30 in May. The oldest, Roger Federer, will be 36 in August. They are not only the best players on the tour right now, but also among the oldest. And it’s not just the Big 4 – the top 50 players are on an average older than they've been in the past 30 years. Women, too, are getting older. And as the top players have aged, younger players have had to wait longer to make it into the top ranks.

Eunice de Souza (1940-2017): No Tears in the Eye of the Storm,"Eunice de Souza (1940-2017) never had the slightest patience with the claims of a normality imposed by consensus or authority. Not one to be trapped in a ghetto, whether ethnic, academic or political, she early embraced the rapture of all that was strange and liberating. In her poem ‘Return’, she revisits the moment when she first heard the French Jesuit and translator Guy Deleury, then resident at the Christa Prema Seva Ashram, read the Marathi saint-poet Tukaram’s abhangas:

Tuka, forgive my familiarity.

I have loved your pithy verses

ever since that French priest

everyone thought mad

recited them, and told us

of his journey with your people.

…

You made life hard for your wife

and I’m not sure I approve of that.

Nor did you heed her last request:

Come back soon.

Deleury, with his lifelong devotion to Tukaram and to India’s Bhakti literature of ecstasy and protest, was an emancipatory part of de Souza’s growing up in Poona, where she was born in 1940. Demonstrating her refusal to conform to what she experienced as the stifling pieties and norms of her Goan Catholic birth community, she sought out unusual, even eccentric figures like Deleury (who later renounced his priestly calling and entered secular life) and the Santiniketan-trained Goan émigré artist Angelo da Fonseca, whose radiant Indianisation of Christian iconography had prompted orthodox opinion to cast him into exterior darkness. Such presences, and the pathways they opened up, nourished de Souza’s imagination.

At the same time, as a young poet and academic, de Souza articulated the difficulties confronted by a woman making her way in the India of the 1960s and 1970s, a postcolonial society in which feudalism and patriarchy continued to dominate public life and the accepted perception of gender destiny. As a student in the Midwest at the beginning of the 1960s, de Souza would surely have caught the thrum of dissidence that would soon challenge the American ascendancy in the name of race, gender and sexual choice during the civil rights movements. Although she returned to India in 1963, these revolutions in thought and practice inspired her at a distance. While the label ‘confessional’ is a reductive and inadequate one, de Souza’s encounter with the work of such poets as Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton and Adrienne Rich offered her models of poetry that opened up forms of public expression for women, forms that allowed for the naming and saying of personal experiences that had no place in a patriarchal framework.

Eunice de Souza with former chief minister of Kashmir Omar Abdullah at the Goa Art & Literature Festival, 2012. ((Siddesh Mayenkar/Herald Review))

De Souza’s feminism was mapped along a spectrum from the sardonic to the ferocious. Some of her targets were more fortunate than others. Tukaram, loved for his startling and often irreverent poetry of mystical transport, is gently rebuked for his indifference to his wife’s struggles. But in the precisely titled ‘Autobiographical’, de Souza appears to pay the patriarchy back in its own coin before recording the insight that structural violence replicates itself in an internalised counter-violence of the individual that is every bit as corrosive and depleting:

I thought the whole world

was trying to rip me up

cut me down go through me

with a razor blade

then I discovered

a cliché: that’s what I wanted

to do to the world.

In the later ‘Songs of Survival’, she registers a move towards a more stoic, ironic stance, not resignation so much as wisdom:

Practice grave courtesy:

there are no tears in the

eye of the storm.

Survive to know you can.

There is little to be said

for suffering.

It has been tempting for many readers to interpret de Souza’s poetry as the unfolding chronicle of an embattled self constantly crafting idioms of belonging in a hostile world. While this account has its own relevance, a survey of her expanded practice reveals the opposite of self-absorption. Her approach to the world was versatile and founded on a restless curiosity. Throughout her career, de Souza was active as a literary critic, editor, researcher, and columnist. She wrote art criticism for some years, and retained a lively interest in the visual arts. She wrote books for children and compiled benchmark anthologies such as These My Words: The Penguin Book of Indian Poetry, a collaboration with her lifelong friend and colleague Melanie Silgardo.

To mourn de Souza is also to mourn a period and a milieu in Bombay’s cultural life when the arts had not become narrowly professionalised and mutually separated, and when compelling intellectual and artistic synergies exploded across the scene. Writers and painters, architects and filmmakers, activists and advertising professionals met, formed friendships and collegialities, often collaborated, or inspired one another’s enterprises. Poets like Nissim Ezekiel transited between academia and the visual arts. Poets like Arun Kolatkar and Dilip Chitre straddled the worlds of literature and advertising. Poets like Adil Jussawalla were active in academia, journalism and publishing. These cultural experimenters and their contemporaries were responsive to theatre and music, often working together with colleagues to develop work beyond the page. Many of them were engaged in translation, as a bridge between languages and language-universes separated by historical circumstances. They were committed to keeping the transmission lines of literature open, whether through little magazines or small presses, as the splendid recent research of scholars like Laetitia Zecchini and Anjali Nerlekar has shown.

While the Clearing House publishing collective has, correctly, received retrospective acclaim for its role in this history, the 1960s and 1970s were animated by numerous, often intersecting, mutually replenishing reading circles and publishing platforms of varying longevity. Among these were the circle around Nissim Ezekiel at the PEN, the salons that Kamala Das convened, imprints such as Pras Prakashan, and successors to Clearing House such as Newground and Praxis, which published de Souza’s early collections of poetry. The critical, vigorously recalcitrant, self-renewing energies of this background continued to pulse through Eunice de Souza’s work until the very end. Wintry as its wisdom sounds, her last book of poems, Learn from the Almond Leaf, published last year, offers us unquiet, incandescent meditations like ‘A Smattering of Rain’:

A smattering of rain,

Earth lets off steam.

A hawk falls.

A volcano upchucks.

Watch it!

Earth’s heart is still

smouldering.

‘End of combustion engine-powered car’: Volvo to go all electric from 2019,"Geely-owned Volvo Car Group said on Wednesday all new models launched from 2019 will be fully electric or hybrids, spelling the eventual end to nearly a century of Volvos powered solely by the internal combustion engine.

The Gothenburg-based company will continue to produce pure combustion-engine Volvos from models launched before that date, but said it would introduce cars across its model line-up that ranged from fully electric cars to plug-in hybrids.

Volvo’s plans make it the first major traditional automaker to set a date for the complete phase-out of combustion-engine-only models though electrification has long been a buzzword across the industry and Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one.

“This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,” Volvo Cars chief executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.

Five new models set to be launched in 2019 through 2021 - three of them Volvos and two Polestar-branded - will all be fully or partially electric.

“These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models,” Volvo said.

“This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor.”

Volvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz and BMW.

Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies which allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars.

Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division.

Volvo has also taken steps towards an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares last year, though the company has said no decision on an IPO has been made."
Abandoned bunkers of 1962 Indo-China war attract tourists to Nelong Valley,"Far from the latest Sino-India standoff in the eastern border, Uttarakhand’s Nelong Valley along the border with China continues to attract discerning travellers to its picturesque Ladakh-type landscape and abandoned bunkers of the 1962 Chinese aggression.

Perched at around 11,000 feet close to the China border, the valley lies in the Gangotri National Park area in Uttarkashi district - around 315 km from Dehradun.

Once a buzzing hotspot for the Indo-Tibet trade, the valley was closed for civilians and tribals residing in villages were shifted out from there at the time of the 1962 Sino-India war.

Though the battle did not play out in this region, bunkers were erected in the valley from the security point of view, local experts say.

The valley then remained out of bounds for civilians for over five decades post the 1962 war, before a part of it was ultimately reopened by the Uttarakhand government for tourists in 2015.

“No longer in use, these bunkers in the open-for-civilians-area of the valley are now attracting tourists...visitors feel very excited to set foot in the abandoned bunkers and to get a feel of how the soldiers would have survived during the harsh, climatic conditions,” said Tilak Soni, an Uttarkashi-based adventure and tourism expert who strove for the reopening of the valley.

Vinod Panwar, who visited the Valley recently, said: “The entire valley is like a thrilling surprise package, tucked in the Himalayas…but I especially enjoyed peeking inside an old bunker dotted along the route, getting the feel of a soldier’s life.”

Uttarkashi district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava said over 464 tourists have visited the valley since April this year, which is “double the number from the last year”.

Almost 90% of the tourists applied for the special permit (which is required for visiting the valley) online through a single window clearance system introduced by the district administration in April this year.

Underlining the valley’s numerous attractions, including the bunkers and an intricate wooden bridge that was used by locals for Indo-Tibet trade prior to the war, Srivastava said, “We are planning to develop the entire region from heritage tourism point of view and to offer a whole range of interpretation about different attractions of the Valley to further enhance tourists’ experience.”"

"RSS plans aggressive expansion in Kerala, aims 9 lakh cadres by 2019","The RSS has decided to go on an aggressive expansion exercise in Kerala to achieve a target of nine lakh cadres by 2019.

Senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary J Nandakumar claimed that there has been an increase in attacks on RSS workers, but added that the organisation is determined in its mission of development of the overall society in Kerala.

“In fact, these attacks have further strengthened our commitment towards the nation and the society. Now we will more aggressively pursue our work,” he said, adding that the number of RSS cadres will touch the 9 lakh figure by 2019.

The Left-ruled state accounts for the maximum number of 5,000 shakhas or daily morning meetings of RSS members among all ‘prants’ (regions) and the number is rising, Nandakumar further claimed.

Gujarat has around 1,000 shakhas, the daily gathering of RSS workers that includes prayer and physical activities.

Nandakumar, the national convener of RSS-affiliate Prajna Pravah, who is from Kerala, also said that the Left is losing its ground in the state as more and more people are joining the RSS.

“I can say that there is a craze among youths in the state towards our nationalist organisation,” he said.

He also alleged that RSS workers were being “brutally killed by state-sponsored actors” but said the Sangh is determined in its mission of development of the overall society in Kerala."
"This day, that chair: Virat Kohli finds his debut ‘seat’ ahead of Dambulla ODI","Senior cricketers are often known to own their corner of the dressing room, a right earned over years of high performance for their team.

India skipper Virat Kohli is no different as he rakes in one batting performance after another in his illustrious career.

Virat Kohli is already a winner of the World Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy, but has returned to the Dumbulla International Stadium, where it all started. It was at this venue exactly nine years ago, on August 18, 2008, that Kohli made his One-day International debut, against Sri Lanka.

On Friday, two days ahead of India’s fresh five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka, Virat Kohli took a sweet nostalgic moment in the middle of his intense training on Friday. He spotted the chair on which he had sat on debut in Dambulla nine years ago.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India tweeted the picture of a beaming Virat Kohli seated on the chair which he had taken in 2008, this time holding up the victory sign.

It all started on this very chair, this very date and this very ground. 9 years today with the Indian cricket team! So grateful. 🙏 @BCCI pic.twitter.com/23vEL1tO3K — Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) August 18, 2017

In that first game, Virat Kohli, as opener, managed only 12 runs as India were dismissed for 146 and Sri Lanka coasted to an eight-wicket victory. He fared better in his second game at the same Dambulla International Stadium two days later, scoring 37 as India won by three wickets.

Cannes 2017: Fatih Akin’s In the Fade is all about a mother’s terrible sorrow,"Turkish moviemaker Fatih Akin, who lives in Germany, was back at the Cannes Film Festival with his latest outing, In the Fade. His last Croisette visit was as long ago as 2007, when he brought his The Edge of Heaven to clinch the best screenplay award. A story about loneliness, desperation and a sense of hope and hopelessness, The Edge Of Heaven was a great hit in Cannes.

But unfortunately, not In the Fade. Which seems to have divided opinion. An Indian journalist, revered and reviled for his right-wing extremism, saw Akin’s work as one propagating and promoting suicide bombing. This writer did not. Nor did a French lady, who works in one of the country’s government departments. She felt that it was “a beautiful story of a German mother’s angst at having lost her six-year-old son and her Turkish husband in a Neo-Nazi attack”.

In Germany and in some other places in Europe, radical Nazi tendencies are on the rise. There was a time when one saw posters proclaiming this political ideology even in Cannes - and cities like Paris.

So, Akin’s movie - if at all it has to be read as a political comment - must be viewed as one that underlines the futility of killing. Revolving around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground (NSU) - which has been targeting immigrants, especially Muslims, In the Fade draws us into a compelling, deeply disturbing drama about a mother (played with a touch of brilliance by Diane Krugger) -- who fails to get justice in Germany’s legal system when her little son and husband of Turkish origin are killed in a blast set off by a bomb outside his shop. The culprits are a young German couple. And after the courts falter and sets the couple free, the mother seeks revenge, planting a bomb under a caravan that the two use. She also kills herself.

In the Fade is the story of a German mother who seeks revenge for the killing of her son and husband of Turkish origin.

Akin, whose parents came to Hamburg in the 1960s, says he is very angry with that notorious group which perpetrated a series of murders in Germany between 2000 and 2007. He told the media here the other day: “The NSU scandals were huge in Germany in 2011. I was very angry when I heard what happened and that anger drove me to write this. As I started writing, other layers and characters were created to make the story believable. So it’s a character-driven movie more than a revenge or political thriller. It’s more about the evolution of grief, and what happens to a mother when you take her kids away from her. How does she continue to live?

“It disturbs me to be an enemy, just because I am who I am: the son of Turkish parents with brown hair and brown eyes. Or that you live in the West, and that you could be a target simply because of where you are from. We do not defend a political ideology but somehow we are targets. The only thing I can do is strike back with a film. My movie is a strike-back.”

The film revolves around the actual events involving the neo-Nazi National Social Underground.

In the Fade is narrated in three chapters. The first one is all about Katja (Krugger), who marries Nuri (Numan Acar), in prison. He is serving time for a drug-related offence. But he is soon out, and the couple live a happy life with their six-year-old son. The second chapter is all about the horrific nail-bomb attack in which the father and son are killed. The third segment takes us into revenge and retribution.

Akin’s work, competing for the Palm dÓr, is well shot, neatly executed and had the ability to keep this critic glued to his seat. Intelligently conceived, Akin’s In the Fade has the same power and punch that we saw in his earlier The Cut - a bold plot about the 1915 Armenian genocide in which 1.5 million people were butchered.

The question now is, as we go closer to the Palm dÓr, whether Akin’s vengeful tale will shake the Pedro Almodovar jury to give it a prize. There are of course other equally strong contenders like Redoubtable (a lovely take on Jean-Luc Godard), the American Civil War drama, The Beguiled, and Francois Ozon’s Amant Double about a torrid love affair between a psycho-analyst and his young patient.

That’s up from 400 million disclosed last September, but far short of a goal of 1 billion by 2018. Microsoft has already acknowledged it won’t hit 1 billion in time . Getting halfway has taken nearly two years.

Windows 10 represents a comeback for Microsoft after a disastrous Windows 8 launch and heavy competition from phone systems such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. Getting more devices on Windows 10 will help encourage companies to make more apps and services for it.

CEO Satya Nadella disclosed the figure Wednesday at a Microsoft conference in Seattle.

After getting Microsoft on track to prioritizing mobile devices and internet-based services, Nadella says artificial intelligence will get a bigger focus."
Partition-1947 movie review: If it wasn’t Lord Mountbatten then who divided India?,"Partition 1947

Cast: Hugh Bonneville, Gillian Anderson, Manish Dayal, Huma Qureshi, Michael Gambon

Director: Gurinder Chadha

Rating: 2.5/5

History is written by the victors.

In the 340-room opulent Delhi house lives master of the country’s fate Lord Mountbatten, who has no clue about what’s going inside it. Seemingly a misfit for the job, he has arrived in India to finalise its partition into two states, one for Hindus and Sikhs and the other for Muslims.

Riots have already broken and thousands have been killed in Punjab and Bengal province, and thus Viceroy Mountbatten wants to get over with the physical division of the border as soon as possible. Little does he know that he is just a pawn in a much bigger scheme of things orchestrated by Winston Churchill years ago! In fact, somebody in the film says this in as many words, ‘Churchill had a vision.’

Visionary or not, Churchill, of course, plays an important part in Gurinder Chadha’s film, which heavily borrows from a couple of books including Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins’ Freedom At Midnight.

There are spoilers ahead.

The idea is to develop a theory around a war document of 1945, which brings out Churchill and thus England’s overall aggressive policy towards South Asia. As per Viceroy’s House, titled Partition 1947 in Hindi, the great Indian dissection was a tactic to restrict the Russian influence in the mineral oil zone. It would have given our old, tyrant masters a firm chance to control Jinnah’s Pakistan and thus its neighbour Afghanistan. Apparently, it was much more difficult to lead Jawaharlal Nehru and his futuristic policies in the same way.

All this is known to the audience way before Louis Mountbatten (Hugh Bonneville, Robert Crawley in TV series Downton Abbey), who despite being the King’s relative knows nothing about the imperial policies. His anger and grief after realising how he has been played soon transform into a volatile remorse, which makes him more human towards the Indians and the local culture.

When Michael Gambon’s Lord Ismay tells him that he and nobody else is the chief architect of India’s division because the arrangement is called the Mountbatten plan then, for a moment, you might take his side. After all, he is just a poor war veteran, who, along with Lady Edwina Mountbatten (Gillian Anderson), is running an outreach programme in the Indian capital for poor, sufferers and people who eat with their hands.

In short, his blissful ignorance of a conspiracy of such high magnitude is the director’s ploy to shift the rage towards the players sitting in England rather than those who are getting the partition executed on the ground in India. You don’t know whether to laugh or cry when Cyril Radcliffe, the engineer of the Radcliffe line between India and Pakistan, says how this is his maiden India tour.

Feasibility aside, this points a finger towards the local leadership’s cluelessness towards the proceedings. How did Gandhi and Nehru miss it when Jinnah got it long before them? Then there is a conversation where Jinnah tells Mountbatten how they both wanted this to happen for their own interests.

But before that, Chadha exposes Jinnah’s high-handedness and his lust for a separate country.

The stories from the interiors of the Viceroy’s House come crawling out via some Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims working for Lord Mountbatten. Two of them are Jeet Kumar (Manish Dayal) and Aaliya (Huma Qureshi). Their history goes all the way to Lahore where Jeet helped Aaliya’s freedom fighter father(Om Puri in one of his last roles) in the prison. This partition is also a question mark on their future, safety and belief in a common culture in times of fanaticism.

At best a highlighted sidetrack, they never take the centre-stage as the pain of one of the biggest migrations in the history of mankind engulfs us all. From Lahore to Delhi, the ochre sky is filled with shrieks and stories of inhumanity except for Lord Mountbatten, who as per the film is still passionate about the safety and wellbeing of the Indians. What a wrong choice to carry out the divisive English plans!

You’ll also meet Gandhi ji (Neeraj Kabi) who forces Mountbatten to taste his curd made of goat’s milk, or some Cambridge-educated gentlemen who are no less refined than the English lords. A couple of AR Rahman tunes enhance the mood here and there, but fail to contribute anything significant to Chadha’s version of the Indian partition.

In 106 minutes, Gurinder Chadha ably paints the anxiety and painful relocation of millions on the both sides of the border. Her handling or rather handing out a clean chit to England’s last Viceroy to India seems over-simplification of the historic episode though.

UK to ban sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040,"Britain on Wednesday it will outlaw the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans from 2040 in a bid to cut air pollution but environmental groups said the proposals did not go far enough.

Environment minister Michael Gove announced the move as part of the government’s keenly-awaited 3 billion pounds (USD 3.9 billion, 3.4 billion euro) air pollution plan, which will demand that councils propose measures by March next year to reduce nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels.

The ban on petrol and diesel cars as well as vans follows a similar proposal by the French government, and will also include hybrid vehicles that have an electric motor and a petrol or diesel engine.

“The Conservatives had a manifesto promise to ensure that by 2050 there would be no diesel or petrol vehicles on the road and today we’re confirming that should mean no new diesel or petrol vehicles by 2040,” Gove told BBC Radio 4.

Britain’s High Court demanded that the government produce plans to tackle illegal NO2 pollution, largely caused by diesel emissions, and a draft report was published in May, but the full report was delayed by last month’s snap general election.

The government will provide local councils with 255 million pounds to bring NO2 levels to legal levels, with possible solutions including the removal of speed humps, reprogramming traffic lights and changing road layouts.

Campaigners want cities to impose entry fees on diesel drivers, but councils will only be allowed to do so if no other measures are available, with ministers wary of “punishing” drivers of cars who bought their vehicles in good faith, according to media reports.

“Diesel drivers are not to blame and, to help them switch to cleaner vehicles, the government will consult on a targeted scrappage scheme, one of a number of measures to support motorists affected by local plans,” a government spokesman said.

Gove added that he did not believe “that it is necessary to bring in charging.”

Campaign group ClientEarth warned that health issues “caused by exposure to illegal air pollution are happening now, so we need urgent action.”

Fellow campaigners Greenpeace also warned that the plans did not do enough to combat the immediate issue of NO2 pollution in cities

“While this plan makes the right headline-grabbing noises, in reality it means that children across the UK will continue to be exposed to harmful air pollution for years to come, with potentially irreversible impacts,” said Areeba Hamid, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace UK.

“Providing a long term vision is not enough, (Michael) Gove still needs protect our health right now from toxic fumes polluting our streets.”

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that the move could cost jobs.

“Currently demand for alternatively fuelled vehicles is growing but still at a very low level as consumer have concern over affordability, range and charging points,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

“Outright bans risk undermining the current market for new cars and our sector which supports over 800,000 jobs across the UK, we could undermine the UK’s successful automotive sector if we don’t allow enough time for the industry to adjust.”

Air pollution contributes to the death of more than 40,000 people per year in Britain, according to official figures, with nitrogen dioxide a particular problem.

Norway, which is aiming to end the use of all cars running on fossil fuels by 2025, offers generous tax breaks for electric vehicles as well as free parking and the use of bus lanes."

"Congress’s Kisan Sammelan to test its unity, poll readiness for 2018","Congress’s Kisan Sammelan (farmers’ convention) in Lahaar of Madhya Pradesh’s Bhind district, close to Gwalior, will signal its readiness for the 2018 assembly polls and also whether the party’s ‘Dabra’ spirit can be revived.

The ‘Dabra’ spirit is the holy grail for Congress unity. In 1993, the late Madhavrao Scindia initiated a conclave of senior Congress leaders in Dabra, a small town 45 km from Gwalior, just before the 1993 assembly elections where they managed to bury the hatchet and succeeded in coming to power besting the BJP.

The parallels are obvious. The ‘show’ at Laahar will be Madhavrao’s son, Jyotiraditya’s, and all senior Congress leaders, including former Union minister Kamal Nath, AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh, leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, senior state leader Suresh Pachauri, Congress state president Arun Yadav will be among the present.

The Scindias, erstwhile rulers of Gwalior state, have held sway in the entire region for decades even though BJP has been in power for the past 17 years in the state.

Also, Lahaar is Congress MLA Govind Singh’s constituency, and the fact that he is closer to Digvijaya Singh than Scindia has not gone unnoticed in political circles. Now, it remains to be seen how things pan out on the unity front.

Ajay Singh, son of late Congress leader Arjun Singh who was part of the Dabra conclave, told HT, “Though the Dabra spirit was of a different era, it is also true that for the past two-three months we are moving in that direction and the Lahaar convention is a step towards it.”

Loud and Visible

The preparations for the sammelan are visible all around. In Gwalior, posters portraying party unity span on the busy road outside the railway station and elsewhere in the city, appealing all to join the Kisan Sammelan.

Local rallies are being taken out by Congressmen, and several vehicles, with blaring loudspeakers reminding people of the convention, have been doing the rounds of the city for the past few days.

Over 2,000 vehicles will accompany Scindia’s rally from Gwalior to Lahaar and it will take around four hours to reach Lahar as all the leaders will be greeted at several places along the route.

Tapping into Farmers’ Anger

With the BJP government on the back foot, the rally, focussing on the farmers’ crisis, is aimed at the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls, 16 months away.

There is palpable anger among farmers, especially after the killing of six farmers in police firing and lathi-charge in Mandsaur in the first week of June. The farmers are demanding loan waiver and remunerative price for their crops.

State Congress spokesperson, K K Mishra said the party has been raising farmers’ issues through Kisan Sammelans and meetings in state in the past one month. “It started with Scindiaji’s satyagraha in Bhopal and was followed by kisan sammelans in Mhow, Khalghat and Mandsaur.”

After Lahar, two other Kisan Sammelans will be organised in Veerpur in Gwalior and Churhat in Sidhi district, which is Ajay Singh’s constituency.

BJP puts up brave front

The BJP too realises the Congress’s game plan and for the last one month the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been trying to douse the farmers’ anger through a slew of measures — visiting the families of those killed in police firing and announcing compensation of Rs 1 crore for them, purchasing onion at Rs 8 per kg, waiving power bills of small and marginal farmers, and taking out a Kisan Sandesh Yatra where party leaders meet farmers.

The BJP is officially trying to put up a brave front and is dismissive of the Congress.

BJP state spokesperson, Deepak Vijayvargiya says the Congress does not have credibility, leadership or organisation in the state.

“They are doing this with an eye on the polls, and not due to genuine concern for farmers,” he said."
