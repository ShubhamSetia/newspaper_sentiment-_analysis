Let the poor sell their children as a poverty alleviation measure,"The Parliamentary Standing Committee on health, in its report on the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill 2016, has said that women should be allowed to rent their womb and become surrogate mothers for total strangers in exchange for a hefty sum of money, a rate that will be fixed by the government. The panel was of the view that “economic opportunities available to surrogates through surrogacy services” should be permitted. The Committee observed that if many impoverished women are able to provide their children with education, construct home, start a small business, etc. by resorting to surrogacy, there is no reason to take this away from them.

If surrogacy is an economic opportunity, why not selling of babies or children? If a couple is in dire need of money and the sale of children can help alleviate their poverty, why can’t they do it? Every time they needed money, they could produce a baby and sell it, or sell one of the already existing babies/children and reduce their own burden and also help a childless family in the process. India could be selling its excess population of poor children all over the world perhaps. It could become a market leader. It could help reduce the population and could be the best poverty alleviation scheme with no input of government’s scarce resources.

This reminds one of the satirical essay by Jonathan Swift called A Modest Proposal or to give the full title- A Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and For making them Beneficial to the Publick. Swift’s recommendation for impoverished Irish was to ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. “A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled…,” said Swift. The standing committee’s proposal seems no less satirical, except that they are dead serious.

“For any woman who is going through surrogacy, there is a certain cost and certain loss of health involved. Not only will she be absent from her work, but will also be away from her husband and would not be able to look after her own children,” says the committee. It therefore recommended that surrogate mother should be adequately and reasonably compensated. Actually, allowing them to sell their own babies might be so much simpler! No absence from work. No neglecting the children she chooses to keep. She is in fact earning some money for them.

The committee goes on to express great concern over the fact that surrogate mothers could be exploited as “there are enormous inequalities in the bargaining power of surrogates vis-à-vis medical clinics and commissioning parents due to surrogate’s illiteracy, socio-economic marginalization and lack of access to legal representation”. They have a neat solution for it. The government can just fix a minimum retail price for the surrogacy. “The relevant authorities should fix the amount of compensation” says the committee and adds that the fixed amount should not be subject to bargaining between the surrogate mother and her client. No more worries about finding employment for poor women or about Skill India. The government could help fix a minimum rate for selling children too.

In fact, why only women and children, maybe all poor people could sell one kidney each at government fixed rates. Maybe some portion of their liver too or any other body parts they can afford to spare. The government could put out a rate list and ensure the money is paid. It could have differential pricing for foreigners, NRIs and Indians. The government could even tax the transactions, differentially of course, and earn some money from it. The options this committee report opens up for the country’s poor is mind boggling- a happy problem of plenty?"
"The real military truth: On Doklam, stop saying the Chicken’s Neck area is vulnerable: it isn’t","The Doklam confrontation is not over by any means, and no one can say how it will turn out. As the two sides reinforce their positions, the portents are not good. In the meantime, India needs to stop overplaying the vulnerability of the Chicken’s Neck, the narrow corridor between north and northeastern India.

Indian commentary has identified the Chicken’s Neck as the driving concern behind New Delhi’s insistence that it must stand firm in Doklam. The Chicken’s Neck area is the area between Bhutan, China, Nepal and Sikkim in the north and Bangladesh to the south. At its narrowest, between Bangladesh and Nepal it is 14-17 km wide. Beyond this, it is about 200 km by 60 km in area. The strategic argument is that China could use Doklam to thrust through the Chumbi Valley to sever northern from northeastern India.

This is an extremely dubious thesis. It is about as credible as arguing that the Siachen Glacier is vital to the security of Kashmir and northwestern India. For one thing, Indian forces in the Doklam-Sikkim sector are superior to their PLA counterparts, a point that Indian experts never tire of repeating. India clearly has the advantage of the heights, numbers, and logistics. If so, a Chinese breakthrough here is highly unlikely.

But assuming that the PLA does get past our defences, a thrust from Doklam or from the trijunction of Bhutan, China and India will have to traverse 100-130 km of Indian territory, with Indian forces all round. Note that the PLA will have to negotiate winding Indian roads on which there is no place to hide. It cannot get its men and equipment off the road, and Indian long-range artillery, rockets and attack aircraft will pick them off in a “turkey shoot”.

If the PLA gets to flatter land, it will be able to fan out. However, by the time it does this, Indian forces from both flanks will have massed. The Chinese may even be vulnerable in their rear, with the Indian army harrowing them from behind. Again, long-range artillery, rockets, and aircraft will have a field day.

Assuming that nevertheless Chinese forces make it to flatter ground and try to consolidate their positions, they will face an enormous logistical problem. Their supplies will have to come all the way from Tibet. In military parlance, India will have the “interior” supply lines which are much shorter while the Chinese will have the exterior lines going back to the Tibetan plateau. As a result, their logistics will be horribly exposed to Indian interdiction. The PLA forces in the Chicken’s Neck area will gradually be starved of supplies and will be destroyed or captured.

Another possibility is that the Chinese would try to take and hold this area with special forces that are parachuted behind Indian lines. Chinese special forces have grown and improved in capability over the past decade, but they are not much more than a short-operations force against paramilitary or insurgent opposition. Their ability to hold ground against regular military forces and expand their operations is extremely limited.

This then is the commonsense military truth. It is not clear why Indian analysts, including unnamed or retired military analysts, continue to propagate the myth that the Chicken’s Neck is vulnerable, but it does us no good to repeat this myth endlessly. Certainly, the PLA knows that a thrust here would be suicidal.

Having said that, there is one circumstance in which the Chicken’s Neck would be vulnerable: all-out war with China. In that case, India would be fighting desperately in many sectors, and it might not be able to defend the Chicken’s Neck sufficiently. If so, the Doklam road would be of little or no relevance since the entire border would be in flames and India’s military situation would be perilous across hundreds of kilometres."
"11-YO Girl Nails 56-YO Relative Who Raped Her For Four Days, Family Wanted To Save The Accused","A courageous 11-year-old with no support from her parents helped nail a 56-year-old distant relative who repeatedly raped her over four days in 2014. Relying on her statements, the special court sentenced the accused to life imprisonment on Friday.

The child, from Karnataka, faced the nightmare when she was sent to the accused and his family in the city by her parents in 2014 to undergo ""exorcism of the evil spirits"" that, they claimed, had possessed her.

Representational Image

The special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court also ordered the accused to pay a compensation of Rs 50,000 to the child. The amount was to be deposited in a fixed deposit account and should be handed over to her when she turns 18.

The court refused leniency to the accused, who claimed he was suffering from hypertension and had to marry off his daughter. ""When the accused is making submissions about his ailments, the plight of the victim, her helplessness at the time of the incident has also to be considered. She was at the mercy of this accused. But he had committed the heinous offence with the girl whom he was expected to take care of,"" retorted the court.

The girl's parents did not come to court; they had even visited her at a shelter with relatives of the accused. The prosecution believes it was an attempt to influence her. ""Generally parents are the first persons to raise their voice for the cause of their child, but here is a case where parents have not turned up for the cause of their child,"" the court said.

Representational Image

The girl told the court that she wanted to continue living in the orphanage as her parents would discontinue her studies.

She added that she had been living with the accused and his family for a month, when all the relatives, except the accused, left for Gujarat for a week. The accused, whom she called 'chachu', sexually assaulted her on October 23, 2014. It continued for the next few days, during which she was confined to a room and threatened that she would be killed is she opened her mouth.

On October 26, when the accused had gone for a bath, she slipped out and escaped to a neighbour's house. She confided in the neighbour about her ordeal. After spending a night at their house, she was taken to the police station to lodge a complaint.

The court dismissed the defence of the accused that she had falsely implicated him as she was fed up of being repeatedly taken to shrines for exorcism. It also refuted the defence claim that the court 'cannot rely on the sole testimony of a victim child suffering from evil spirit.'

"India at seventy: For this continent-sized nation, the quest for a place in the sun continues","The task of accounting for India’s successes and failures is no mean one due to its bewildering complexity. That it is impossible to pigeonhole or fully comprehend India in all its varieties of experiences and outcomes is a given because we are talking of a continent-sized nation. The American scholar, Arthur Asa Berger, wrote in 2008, that “it is hard to reconcile a country that has atom bombs, millions of highly trained engineers, an extremely high growth rate and, at the same time, has millions of cows wandering around its streets and millions of desperately poor farmers.”

Economically, India has been a disappointment. Overall incidence of poverty has fallen from a high of 70% in 1947 to approximately 22% now. However, the pace at which India has slashed poverty has been maddeningly slow compared to other heavily populated countries like Indonesia and China.

Misguided macroeconomic policies driven by socialistic ideology are partly to blame for India’s long post-independence economic stagnation. But even after adoption of market-friendly approaches in the 1990s and record-high GDP growth in recent years, a whopping 300 million Indians remain devoid of basic needs. The United Nations’ Human Development Index, which measures levels of healthcare, education and standard of living, ranked India at 131 out of 188 countries in 2016.

The stubbornness of poverty and malnutrition concentrated in northern and eastern states of India, in spite of the rise of a massive consuming middle class of some 300 million, is a serious flaw that confirms the narrative of India as a heterogeneous country where riches and privation coexist.

To critics on the Left, India can never eliminate poverty if it keeps marching on a ‘neoliberal’ economic path that concentrates the benefits of growth in the hands of big business houses. On the Right, however, the argument is that parts of India where mass poverty is prevalent are presently left out of the burgeoning market economy and must be drawn into it to taste its benefits. A third perspective is that only continuous reform of governance, repurposing of the state apparatus and infrastructure uplift can deliver the poor out of misery.

Since the election of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister in 2014, there has been a surge of expectation and optimism about India overcoming its socio-economic maladies and galloping ahead like the east Asian ‘tigers’. A Prosperity Index by the private investment firm Legatum gave India its best ranking in governance in 2016. Transparency International has also promoted India up the ladder for lowering corruption under Modi’s watch.

India’s foreign policy, which used to be lackadaisical and reactive for decades, has also gotten an infusion of confidence and proactiveness under Modi. The utter frustration that India was not living up to global expectations by taking on more international responsibilities has been dispelled by Modi’s quest to make India a “leading power” on the world stage.

Yet, as India turns 70, the spectre of Chinese hegemony and the threat it poses to India’s ambitions in Asia and beyond has magnified. China will seek to bolster Pakistan with more financial aid and military support to try and keep India bogged down in south Asia.

Although the chief of the Indian army, General Bipin Rawat, has talked of India being prepared for a “two-and-half front war” scenario with China, Pakistan and internal Maoist rebels, the history of the last 70 years shows that China and Pakistan could never simultaneously declare war on India due to the role of fourth parties (the Soviet Union/ Russia and USA).

Indian national strategy under Modi should be to ensure that major external powers like Russia and USA stay on its corner or are at least wary of China to ward off the possibility of a two-front war by China and Pakistan against India, that could deal a catastrophic blow to India’s developmental pursuits.

Seventy-year-old India has its tasks cut out. They are to reduce the regional imbalances, inequalities and anomalies in its socio-economic transformation and to emerge as a provider of global public goods in its foreign policy."
"After Minor Girl's Rape On I-Day, Divyanka Tweets To PM Saying She’s Scared To Have A Daughter","India is not safe for women. Delhi is the rape capital of the country. Every other day we hear about a new rape case that sends shockwaves through the entire nation. And it happened again—ironically on the Independence Day. When the entire nation was celebrating the independence of the country, a minor girl, 12-year-old, was raped in Chandigarh.

She was returning from home after attending the Independence Day function, and on her way back, she was raped at knife point at the Children Traffic Park of Sector 23. She was a class 8th student studying in a government school.

Now Facebook Gets 'Stories' Feature,"After Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp got a Snapchat-like ""Stories"" update, users on Tuesday got access to the new Facebook Camera feature that lets them add effects to their photos and videos.

They can now share this content to a Snapchat clone called 'Facebook Stories' that appears above News Feed on mobile and works similar to Instagram's 24-hour slideshows.

Users can also share these posts to News Feed of individual friends through the new 'Facebook Direct' private visual messages that disappear after some time.

""As people mostly post photos and videos, 'Stories' is the way they're going to want to do it. Obviously we've seen this doing very well in other apps. Snapchat has really pioneered this,"" technology website Tech Crunch quoted Facebook Camera product manager Connor Hayes as saying.

He said Facebook was shifting away from text status updates after 10 years as its primary sharing option.

According to Hayes, the rapid ascent of Instagram Stories to 150 million daily users inspired the Menlo Park social media giant to start testing its own Stories in January, and keep expanding it to 12 countries before rollout.

""We've tested in markets with Instagram Stories and Messenger Day, and we've seen this as accretive. They end up posting more and they like using the 'Stories' format across apps,"" Hayes added.

WhatsApp recently received thumbs down when it changed from a text-based to a stories-based status update.

The company brought back the text-based status update feature last week.

"Assam Celebrates Independence Day Amid Floods, Hoists Tricolor In A Boat & Knee-Deep Water","Assam is currently experiencing a tragic chain of events, seemingly state's worst deluge in the last three decades. With more than 10,00,000 affected in the span of 24 hours and over 102 dead, people in the region are undergoing a loss they're ready to recover from.

Amid all the difficulties and tension, the state celebrated Independence day with the same fervour as the entire nation.

Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal unfurled the flag at the Veterinary College ground at Khanapara, while other government officials celebrated at different venues in the state.

While some took it the streets riding cycles, motorcycles and waving the flag, others stuck to wherever they were to hoist our revered flag.

The right notes from the Red Fort,"The most remarkable thing about the PM’s speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day was its omission — of any reference to the ongoing standoff in neighbouring Bhutan, next to the where the borders of India, China and Bhutan meet, with the People’s Liberation Army. The rhetoric on the Chinese side had been met with firm refusal to comply with China’s demand that Indian troops withdraw, without any answering rhetoric from New Delhi. This tactic found its most obvious expression in the Prime Minister’s refusal to mention the word Dokalam in his speech. This is sound. India protects its interest and leaves it to China to act the aggressor.

PM Narendra Modi did not surprise anyone when he claimed that demonetisation has helped unearth black money and that his crackdown on black money will spare no one. The claims to be accelerating the pace of rail and road construction, too, were on predictable line. That he had to repeat the claim of bringing power to villages that had been kept dark till now, a major theme in his Independence Day speech last year, stands testimony to the challenge the last mile presents in such tasks. Where the PM broke new ground was in making an unequivocal commitment to social cohesion and rejection of jingoism. Violence in the name of faith is not acceptable, he said. This is most welcome.

He should keep saying this and get the state machinery to live up to this claim. Neither abuse nor bullets (na gaali se, na goli se) can solve the Kashmir problem, he said. We hope this sentiment will inform the response of the government and to the demand raised by Sangh Parivar outfits to end Kashmir’s special constitutional status.

More explicitly than in any of his three previous Independence Day speeches, the PM deployed India at 75 as the focus of his government, rather than the outcome of the next general elections. This lays the ground not only for schemes and the inspiration to build a New India but also for preparing the electorate for the continuity of a Modiled government all the way up to 2022. In sum, another bravura performance by the Prime Minister."

Remove BCCI's current office bearers: CoA to SC

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 05:39 PM

The CoA is unhappy with the ouster of CEO Rahul Johri from the BCCI meeting © AFP

In its fifth status report submitted to the Supreme Court, the Committee of Administrators (CoA) has asked for the removal of the current office bearers of the BCCI for the non-compliance of the court's orders to adopt the Lodha reforms. The CoA cited the court's January 2 ruling that ousted Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke from their BCCI posts, for the eviction of acting president CK Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary.

""The Committee of Administrators submits that since the then President and Secretary of the BCCI had been removed because the BCCI failed to implement the reforms mandated by the Judgement despite a period of six months having passed, it is only fair that the current office bearers be treated in the same manner because a further period of six months have elapsed since the said office bearers submitted their undertakings and the reforms mandated by this Hon'ble Court have still not been implemented,"" the report stated.

The report has been submitted two days ahead of the July 18 hearing, wherein the three-member SC bench comprising Justices Deepak Misra, AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud will reconsider some of the Lodha recommendations which it previously accepted, like the one-state-one-vote, strength of the selection committee and the concept of associate membership. Earlier in an SGM held on July 26, BCCI had decided to selectively adopt the Lodha reforms, leaving out five of them.

It was during the same SGM on July 26, when BCCI CEO Rahul Johri was asked to leave. The latest report by CoA, claims that the office-bearers deliberately misconstrued the SC order and ousted Johri from the SGM.

""After the attendance register was signed, the CEO and the other administrative staff including the legal team of the BCCI was asked to leave the meeting on the purported basis that the order dated July 24, 2017 passed by this hon'ble Court only permits office bearers to attend the same""

The CoA further wrote that this was a pre-planned and orchestrated move by the BCCI and explained the 'obvious' motive behind the same. ""The motivations of such a clever manoeuvre are fairly obvious. The presence of the CEO in the previous SGM held on June 26, 2017 had enabled the Comittee of Administrators to receive first-hand account of the proceedings and bring conduct of certain specific individuals to the attention of this Hon'ble Court. The absence of CEO from the July 26 SGM would make (and has made) that task very difficult.""

The CoA brought to SC's notice that the BCCI had failed to adopt a new fund disbursement policy which was formulated by Deloitte in line with the Lodha reforms. ""Adoption of the new fund disbursment policy by BCCI is one such reform aimed at ensuring proper allocation of funds to the State Associations based on need/requirement and with appropriate checks in place to ensure proper utlization and reporting by State associations.""

The report conveyed to the SC, BCCI's failure to appoint a new Ombudsman, despite the position being left vacant since September 2016 after the Justice (retd.) AP Shah stepped down. He had been roped in to address the conflict of interest issues prevalent within Indian cricket. The CoA also noted that the BCCI failed to adopt the new BCCI conflict of interest rules during the SGM in July, despite being handed the copy of the same through email more than a month prior to the meeting. Since the BCCI did not list new conflict of interest rules as one of the five reforms it was against, there was no justifiable reason for BCCI to not adopt the same.

Narendra Modi’s black money claim from Red Fort at variance with Finance Ministry,"One of the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech was his solid defence of demonetisation coupled with claims of having unearthed huge amounts of black money from the system. But data available in the public domain suggests that Modi’s claims need to be taken with a pinch of salt. As per Modi, demonetisation has resulted in almost Rs two lakh crore of black money finding its way back to the banking system.

But this claim is at variance with multiple public statements issued by Finance minister Arun Jaitley and his junior minister Santosh Gangwar between December 2016 and August 1, 2017 which together show that government had no clear estimate of black money in this period. So, either the PM has received new information since or there is a contradiction in claims made by Finance Ministry and PMO.

Demonetisation revealed Rs 3 lakh crore black money, says PM @narendramodi https://t.co/LtJmN0RgzE pic.twitter.com/j26ALppVor — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 16, 2017

Here is what Finance Ministry has been saying on black money estimates so far before Modi’s Red Fort speech:

1. August 1, 2017: Minister of State for Finance, Santosh Gangwar said in a written reply in Rajya Sabha that there was no official estimation of quantum of black money in India. The reply mentions that demonetisation was introduced with a view to curbing financing of terrorism through the proceeds of fake Indian currency notes.

2. July 21, 2017: In a written reply to Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley mentioned there is no official estimation of quantum of black money stashed by Indians in foreign countries or foreign banks. On unaccounted wealth, his statement mentions that the government has commissioned a study on estimation of unaccounted wealth and income which will be conducted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM).

3. April 7, 2017: Gangwar said in Lok Sabha that there is no official estimation of the amount of black money in form of old Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 that have not been deposited during the course of the demonetisation drive. This means that the government is not in a position to say if the money that has not come in after demonetisation is illegitimately earned or otherwise.

Serena Williams Slams Racism Again – Says She Has To Be Twice As Good As Maria Sharapova For Being 'Black',"23 Grand Slams. Open Era queen. And a daring personality on the court - that's Serena Williams. But, according to her, she still has to prove herself every time because of her skin colour.

In an interview with a British publication, she said she has to be twice as good as Maria Sharapova because she is 'black'.

Twitter

""Maria Sharapova, who might not talk to anybody, might be perceived by the public as nicer. Why is that? Because I’m black and so I look mean? ‘That’s the society we live in. That’s life. They say African Americans have to be twice as good, especially women. I’m perfectly ok with having to be twice as good,’ she said.

Twitter

Serena Williams is currently out of action because she is pregnant. Her first child - with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian - is awaited by the end of this year. We would hopefully see Serena resume her tennis duties in the next Australian Open.

The victim was on her way back home after flying the national flag at school when a man stopped her, pulled her into the park and sexually abused her.

""The accused, aged around 40 years, forcibly took the 12 -year-old girl to the park, sexually assaulted her and fled,"" investigating officer in the case, Sub-Inspector Kuldeep said.

The victim, a student of Class 8 of a government school, was taken to a government hospital for a medical examination, the officer said.

The incident comes barely over a week after the 29-year-old daughter of a senior IAS officer was stalked by the son of Haryana BJP chief and his friend.

"Bolt into legend: Despite London fall, Usain Bolt’s sprint legacy will continue to inspire","Sports fans witnessed the unimaginable this past weekend – sprint king Usain Bolt sprawled on the track in the final race of his illustrious career. Running the anchor for the Jamaican team in the 4x100m relay at the London World Championships, Bolt uncharacteristically cramped up midway through his sprint. The superhuman Bolt proved himself to be human after all. He could have bad days. He could get injured in a major competition. He could fail to get that fairytale ending.

This wasn’t the Usain Bolt the world has come to love over a decade. Announcing the beginning of his reign in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the lanky Jamaican has stamped his authority on his sport like no other. The holder of three world records and eight Olympic gold medals, Bolt is certainly the greatest sprinter till date. But the law of averages had to eventually catch up. His 31-year-old body had to eventually give up from all the strenuous training of international competition. That’s precisely what happened at London where Bolt’s best run was a bronze-winning sprint in the 100m final.

But one event can’t undo a legend. Bolt inspired hope at a time when doping had cast a deep shadow on his sport. His superhuman performances were testimony to the fact that clean athletics still has a future. And Bolt’s showmanship on track put the fun back in competitive running. The world will soon forget Bolt sprawled on the London track. What will remain in memory is Bolt’s famous ‘To The World’ pose, daring future athletes to run past his legacy."
Does Our Faith Define Us? This Incredible Video About A Temple Will Make You Think Otherwise,"PARTNER

Can faith move mountains? It sure can, if only, you believe in the right thing. Faith is generally defined by the caste or religion that we belong to, but faith is not just about being a Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Sikh. Faith is believing in each other, it is believing in something that gives you hope and brings you happiness. Faith is about being united even when our so called caste and religion tries to divide us.

This incredible video by United Colors of Benetton, is based on a true story. It is based on the life of a man in Lucknow who gave a part of his house to make a temple. Every day he visits the temple with milk and garlands, not because his faith demands so, but because seeing people still holding on to their hopes and dreams gives him happiness. What is his caste you may ask? Pat comes the reply, he is an Indian. For him, the happiness of the people around him is more important than the caste he belongs to. Known for their strong stand to unite one and all, United Colors of Benetton strongly believe in the ideology of unity. In this video, they bring alive the incredible story of this man in Lucknow and exemplifies how we all can be #UnitedByFaith."
"Hailed As Gorakhpur Hospital Hero, Dr Kafeel Gets Support From Social Media After Being Sacked","At least 70 children have succumbed in Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical College hospital, making it one of the most unfortunate events of our times. As claimed by the authorities, the unfortunate event happened due to the shortage of oxygen supply, as the dues amounting to Rs 65 lakh weren't paid.

BRD Medical College Dr Kafil, child specialist Statement In Gorakhpur pic.twitter.com/s7Xsag6G81 — Bahujan Samaj Party (@BspUp2017) August 13, 2017

Pushpa Co., the organisation that dealt with the supply of oxygen had even threatened the hospital for cutting the supplies if the dues weren't cleaned. They even wrote a letter, clearly stating the consequences if the payment wasn't made.

But what remains unclear that despite these threats. the hospital continued to function, ignoring the fragility of the situation and what might happen if the supply is cut.

As a result, Dr Kafeel Ahmad, the head of the paediatrics department and the encephalitis ward at BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur was been sacked without much mulling. Dr Ahmad, who was once reported as the key figure of the hospital is now being accused of carelessness and the miserable attempt at earning a commission over the payment.

No one should be allowed to use the words ""unfortunate"" and ""tragedy"" in relation to #Gorakhpur. This was murder. — Faye DSouza (@fayedsouza) August 12, 2017

But let's get to know what Ahmad was up to during this debacle. Ahmad made several calls to nearby facilitators, but everyone refused to make the delivery. He was then offered a deal only over full payment in advance -- he did not hesitate for a minute but took out his ATM card and asked one of his staff members to get the cash from his bank account at the earliest.

Upon further deliberation, he found out that a friend owned a private hospital could spare three oxygen cylinders, so he drove himself and fetched those cylinders. He then, single-handily brought 12 oxygen cylinders, trained staff on artificial respiration and made frantic calls to help distraught patients.

Despite everything, Dr Ahmad witnesses the death of 70 children, false accusation and a sacking that made him lose his job. According to the government and the authority, the reason for sacking him is ‘dereliction of duty’ as well as ‘carrying out private practice’.

We don't know whether Dr Ahmad was actually responsible for these deaths or saved many lives as there hasn’t been any official validation from the hospital. But, circumstantial evidence suggests that if Dr Amhed was not there, some more children would have died."
Vaghela’s exit an opportunity for Cong to take a stand in Gujarat,"Shankarsinh Vaghela has quit the Congress party. As a Gujarati, I thank whatever gods may be. There is a larger point to be made and I’ll come to that in a bit.

Vaghela was a dedicated Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh man who should never have been made head of the Gujarat Congress in the first instance. Hindutva has brutalised the state and permanently divided its people and ghettoised its minorities (an act of extreme anti-nationalism).

Congress should have stepped in to recover the truth in Gujarat’s culture of pacifism and mercantilism and pragmatism and progress. Instead, in appointing the Hindutvawadi Vaghela, the party continued the political lie that Hindus and Muslims are permanently at war and communal politics is inevitable. Rubbish.

There are those who say that with Vaghela’s exit the Congress will lose the assembly elections coming in that state in the next six months.

However, it should be pointed out to such geniuses that in his 20 years (he joined hands with the Congress in 1997) the party anyway saw defeat in every single assembly and Lok Sabha election. What great victories was this compromise with first principles bringing the Congress? Not one.

For my parents in Surat, all these years, the option inside the polling booth was always between endorsing an RSS Congress leader or an RSS BJP leader. That’s not really a choice.

If the Congress says it stands for Nehruvian secularism, then the first place that must show is in the people who speak for it and the second in what they say. The same rule applies to my friend Sanjay Nirupam, who heads the Congress in Mumbai. A pleasant fellow but a former Shiv Sainik. I believe in redemption and the idea of reformation, but such people as Vaghela and Nirupam, who jump from leadership position to leadership position without demonstrating their devotion to first principles are unfit.

To the larger point now. What will the 2019 general election be fought on? Given the damage Hindutva is doing to India and Indians, it is clear that it must be fought on an uncompromising anti-Hindutva platform. This should be accompanied by specific things, like the opposition to genius strokes like demonetisation. But the underlying narrative must be carried on the back of an Indian inclusivism that is natural to us and that we can see all around us.

The fact is that the image of India that Hindutva’s supporters hold is not apparent. We are a unified culture being deliberately and mischievously divided. How tough can it then be for the Congress to sell reality? My slogan: ‘Indians are one people. Stop dividing us through Hindutva’.

My colleague Salil Shetty has observed that we are living in a time of democratic authoritarianism, when the sort of mischief that only dictators pursued is today practised by elected despots.

His other observation is that among such ‘strongmen’ type leaders, there are those who use violent and unhinged language, like the Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte and American president Donald Trump. And then there are people like Narendra Modi who speak softly but who have others do the speaking for them.

VP Singh said that to know what Hindutva stood for, do not listen to its leaders, but the people below. The poison that is being spread by Hindutva cannot be gleaned from the Prime Minister’s Twitter feed.

It can be understood by what is being done under him. Gujarat has already passed a law punishing cattle slaughter with life imprisonment, while Chhattisgarh’s CM has pushed for the death penalty. Modi’s criticism of vigilantes should start with attacking or sacking his party’s leaders who encourage the lynchings. But he won’t and that is the plan.

I am told often that many Indians conflate Hindutva with Hinduism. That is dangerous nonsense. Hindutva, a word of recent coinage, is a set of three specific political demands.

First, Musims must surrender their mosque (‘Ram Janmabhoomi’). Second, Muslims must surrender their personal law (‘Uniform Civil Code’). Third, Muslims must surrender their constitutional autonomy in Jammu and Kashmir (‘Article 370’).

After taking power, a fourth political demand has been pushed: Muslims must surrender their dietary habits (‘cattle slaughter ban’). Hindutva is negative, sullen, passive-aggressive (observe the joyless faces of those who peddle it).

What links any of its demands with Hinduism the faith? Not a thing. It is anti-India in the worst way possible: it pushes an idiot nationalism that is ranged not at some enemy but against other Indians. Because of this, in my opinion, it borders on treason. It has to be resisted. Civil society will do what it can but the domain of this resistance is primarily politics.

The saying goes: if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything. For two decades the Congress has fallen for soft communalism in Gujarat. The opportunity has come for it to stand."
Three cheers for folks who made the 70th bash possible,"On this cusp of another anniversary of Indian independence, I would like us to remember the people who made it possible. The worthies who have made this nation and built its institutions: I mean the leaders of the RSS and the BJP.

Who can forget all of their people who went willingly to jail and spent years there? Long years in isolation, while they wrote terrific texts, like the Discovery of Hindu India. And what sacrifices they made. For example there was that RSS man… actually, he apologised to the Brits and got out of jail. Then there was that other BJP man… wait, he apologised too. Anyway, I am sure a name will come to me soon. There were so many of them who resisted the foreigner while proudly waving the mono-colour.

And of course their contributions continued after Independence. The building of institutions, which we can see all around us and which have benefited Indians for decades. Like the Indian Institutes of Technology, modelled on MIT and founded in 1951 (I believe by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad).

And the Indian Institutes of Management, set up in 1961 by the Bajrang Dal. The IIM is the pride of the middle class that today for some reason spits on its founder. The Sahitya Akademi was founded in 1954, by the Gau Rakshaks, the National Institute of Design in 1961, by the Durga Vahini. And then of course the giants of the public sector.

I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, that it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch that established the public sector companies we call, presumably because they are valuable, the Navratnas. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (1964), Oil and National Gas Commission (1956), National Thermal Power Corporation (1975), Steel Authority of India (1954), Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (1964), Indian Oil Corporation (1959). The list goes on. Why were all these set up?

I said to my father: “This is fine and all but ultimately useless. What’s the point of all this socialism? Wasn’t it obvious to them that they should just have privatised everything!”

He said: “You’re right. Except that there was nothing to privatise, beta. Someone thought about and built these things from zero. They were essential for industrialising a poor nation with a peasant economy. And at a time when few Indians had access to capital, and there were no Gujarati billionaires to just hand the stuff over to. It required work from the ground up. Building institutions is not for everyone.”

Nations are not built by speeches, he says, but I am not convinced. All this clinging to institutions smacks of sentimentalism. I was delighted to be informed that this country became a nuclear power, whether the softies like it or not, in 1974, under the BJP and while the opposition was resisting.

Speaking of the good stuff, that is to say hard nationalism, we must turn to our performance in the military field. There was a time when this country could win wars. Real ones with real territory and tens of thousands of captured enemy, not fake ones in TV studios. Today we go into rapture over skirmishes about which no details are revealed. That was not always so and we should thank the BJP for the memories of those victories.

Let us turn to the pragmatic side of the party. On realising that change was needed, we had the economic reforms of the early 1990s. The BJP championed those in the Lok Sabha, if I am not mistaken. And all this while the opposition was resisting modernity. It is for this reason that the 10 years of UPA saw a pathetic 8% growth while the NDA has consistently delivered a majestic 7%. Kitna deti hai? is the question never asked of our economy. But again, who needs data when you are obviously burning with intent to do well?

Most of all I am moved to tears by the BJP’s martyrdoms. The Prime Minister said that three generations had sacrificed themselves so that he could become PM in a Lok Sabha with a BJP majority.

Yes. A lot of sacrificing was done by BJP leaders. One of them died at the hands of her bodyguards, whom she trusted. Another, only a few years later, was killed by assassins he chose to mingle with. Such offerings to the nation which other party has made?

I wonder if those who today accuse the BJP of being anti-national and unpatriotic consider the fact that the history of that party has been written with the blood of its martyred leaders.

I doubt that they do. We are a people for whom it is easy for history to be elastic. We can have Pratap defeat Akbar, we can convert the Taj into a temple. What is a little thing like Independence and what has been achieved since? It is the time of fake news and fake history. We are fortunate that the same people who achieved all those things are still at the helm."
‘SK Abbasi is to Sharif what Manmohan Singh was to Sonia … Pakistan’s SC has poor record of defending democracy’,"With Pakistan also celebrating 70 years of its independence Farahnaz Ispahani, Global Fellow at Washington’s Wilson Centre, former member of Pakistan parliament (from Pakistan People’s Party) and former media advisor to the Pakistan president, spoke to Rohit E David on the political flux in Islamabad after the ouster of Nawaz Sharif as prime minister, its impact on Kashmir and the nefarious role of Pakistan’s deep state:

What is your view on the political prospects of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi who has been PM of Pakistan after Nawaz Sharif stepped down?

PM Abbasi has been nominated by Nawaz Sharif from his own party and is seen by all as a loyal placeholder until the next elections, in which Sharif’s nominated prime ministerial candidate will run. Sharif remains the head of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) and, as is the subcontinent’s tradition, control of the party is more important than who is officially PM. Abbasi is to Sharif what Manmohan Singh was to Sonia Gandhi.

What is your view on Pakistan Supreme Court barring Nawaz Sharif as PM?

The verdict came as no surprise. Pakistan’s Supreme Court has a long history of political decisions and acts directly instead of waiting for due process through lower courts. Now it has disqualified a three times elected prime minister from holding public office for life, in a corruption inquiry linked to the Panama Papers.

However, Sharif was not named in the Panama leaks, there was no trial, and it has yet to be proved that he abused public office for private gain. The judges disqualified him on what many unbiased observers consider a mere technicality. It is indeed sad that no Pakistani PM is allowed to be voted out by the people and SC judges or generals decide when a PM should be ousted.

Why has no Pakistan PM completed a full five-year term?

It is because of what many call the permanent establishment in Pakistan. This is led by the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies; closely emulated by the Supreme Court and, in many instances, the bureaucracy. This is Pakistan’s constant and consistent power base. They do not accept the right of elected leaders to change the nation’s course. The Supreme Court of Pakistan and the five high courts have an extremely poor record of defending democracy against authoritarian interventions. The Supreme Court has legalised each one of Pakistan’s three successful military coups in 1958, 1977 and 1999.

What impact will this have on Pakistan’s Kashmir policy?

Kashmir policy, all regional policy and non-regional foreign policy has been directed by the establishment since Pakistan’s founding. Several civilian prime ministers – most recently Sharif – have tried to improve ties with India but the powerful ‘Kashmir first’ lobbies in Islamabad and Rawalpindi have destroyed all these efforts by the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. India and Pakistan can normalise relations without resolving all disputes first, as many countries have done, but that is not acceptable to the Pakistani establishment. Kashmir policy, anti-India policy and the policy of strategic depth have caused Pakistan to be increasingly isolated in our neighbourhood and around the world. Proponents of that policy do not want to accept that.

Will this make the civilian government weak forever?

Nothing has to be forever. But Pakistan’s permanent establishment and its stranglehold on Pakistan’s media have made it very difficult to stand up to it even as we see today for a hugely popular and elected leader like Nawaz Sharif. Judiciary has become an instrument of the establishment. It responds to media noise rather than sticking to law and legal process.

How do you assess Imran Khan’s role leading up to this court case? Do you foresee Pervez Musharraf and Imran Khan coming out with a third front?

Imran Khan has been in politics for decades but, until now, he has always been a bridesmaid who never made it to being the actual bride. He is thought to be growing more personally unstable and that is making some in the permanent establishment concerned about supporting him in the next elections against Sharif’s powerful PML-N party in the all-important Punjab province. That said, he has some following in urban areas among angry, hyper-nationalist youth and retired military personnel. And he remains a favourite of pro-establishment media.

Do you feel that judicial accountability and judicial independence have become tools of a deep state?

I will only say that judicial accountability must be across the board and not selective to be credible. There is a reason why no general, judge or senior bureaucrat faces the kind of accountability inflicted on politicians. When the process is not transparent, it leads to suspicions about the deep state being at work."

"After The Failure Of 'Jab Harry Met Sejal', Distributors Now Want SRK To Refund Money","With back to back losses and big releases flopping one after the other, Hindi Film industry is indeed going through a rough patch.

Massive flops include films like Salman’s Tubelight, Ranbir Kapoor, and Katrina Kaif’s Jagga Jasoos and now, Imtiaz Ali’s Jab Harry Met Sejal has joined the list. The film that was one of the most anticipated films of the year ended up proving to be one big disaster. Apart from the producers, NH Studioz too has suffered huge losses.

The studios had acquired the rights of Tubelight for Rs. 132 crores and Jab Harry Met Sejal for Rs. 80 crores and now that both the films have proved to be such disasters, the intensity of the losses are huge.

While Salman had set a great example by returning some amount to the distributors, a Bollywoodhungama report claims that the distributors have sent an SOS message to Shah Rukh Khan, and have asked them to follow the suit.

Viral Bhayani

According to the reports, they are now expecting a refund for the backbreaking losses since Shah Rukh Khan had made good profits from the pre-sale of All India Rights to NH Studioz, satellite, music, and digital rights.

Just to jog your memory a little, SRK had distributors of his 2015 film Dilwale when they had incurred losses and he had refunded close to Rs. 25 crores to cover up 50% losses to distributors of Dilwale.

And this wasn’t the first time SRK did so because, in 2001 and 2005, Shah Rukh Khan had refunded the individual distributors of his films Asoka (Eros) and Paheli (UTV) after they failed to perform at the box-office.

While no actor or producer is bounded to return money to distributors, our actors are definitely setting a great example.

5 Ways We Can Help New Mothers Beat Breastfeeding Blues Like A Pro,"PARTNER

Motherhood is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you on a beautiful journey most often, but can sometimes get a bit bumpy too. The unexplained feelings, fear of caring for a new born, and the adjustment to a new life can sometimes get too overbearing for a new mother. One second you're up and the next you're down, which means, yup, you're a mom-so just remember it's totally normal, and try to enjoy the ride.

One of the concerns every new mother finds herself struggling with is her inability to breastfeed her new born child. Though breastfeeding is one of the most natural things, due to stress and other lifestyle changes, mothers find themselves struggling with producing enough milk, which in turn causes them more stress. To provide relief to every new mom out there, here are 5 ways the society can help them beat breastfeeding blues like a pro.

1. Fix an appointment with a lactation consultant

If a new mother is facing sore nipples, latching issues and other breastfeeding issues, the best way to tackle these would be to pay a visit to a lactation consultant. These professionals work with new mothers and provide ample relief to them by offering their support.

2. Share responsibilities and help new mothers take ample rest

Hello world. 🌼 A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 8, 2017 at 12:37am PST

Dealing with 9 months of pregnancy, labour, delivery and then finally a baby can all be too daunting for a young mother. Instead of taking rest, a new mother finds herself managing everything by herself, thus getting tired and irritable. These round-the-clock chores tire the mother to such an extent, that she is not able to breastfeed in peace, which in turn causes issues in milk production. So remember, a happy well-rested mother is all one needs to have a great nursing experience.

3. Create a no-stress atmosphere at home

The worst thing a new mother can find herself in is stressful situations at home. So mothers, the need for an argument with your husband or getting irritated by several nagging relatives can WAIT! It’s time to put your happiness in the forefront for a happy nursing experience.

4. Help new mothers take on life one day at a time

Weekend vibe💤 A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Aug 6, 2017 at 9:06am PDT

Remember, you’re a mother, not a superwoman. Learn to let go of things that are not in your control, and stop getting anxious about the things that you’re not able to do. The art of letting go brings a lot of calmness to an individual, so practice it and take on life one day at a time.

5. Create an environment of a good support system at home

#familytime 💕 A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@therealkareenakapoor) on Jul 31, 2017 at 8:54am PDT

New mothers who have a great support system at home are not only happier but are also known to breastfeed their child for longer and with much ease. It is important for mothers to find adequate support not just from their families, but also the society at large, as shown in this beautiful video by Nestle on Breastfeeding week. A pair of helping hands can make a big difference by allowing a mother time to recover from the birth and establish breastfeeding."

"The 70s: Naxalbari, LSD, Poetry and the Emergency","It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven.

Or so we thought as we entered the seventies. Smoking weed; falling in love; writing poetry and dreaming of a new and just world order.

I had barely entered Presidency College when Naxalbari happened and classmates began to disappear.

They had gone to the forests, in the memorable words of Marxist poet Subhash Mukhopadhyay to fight a war for those who knew not how to. By coincidence, that was when my first book of poems appeared. I got married. All night I stayed awake translating the nine cantos of the Meghnad Badh Kavya, Michael Madhusudan Dutt’s 19th century epic. I did a day job as an office boy in 14 Bentinck Street where the Chinese shoe shops were.

Satyajit Ray’s Aranyer Din Ratri had just released. No one had known there was a sexual side to the Brahmo. Shombhu Mitra was still staging Dasachakra based on Ibsen’s Enemy of the People while Badal Sircar had discovered the Third Theatre and taken his plays out of the proscenium and on to the streets.

Shakti Chattopadhyay, then in his mid-thirties, was lying in the gutters, drunk as usual. His poems scribbled on torn sheets may yet outlive Tagore. Nikhil Biswas had died at 36, leaving behind 10,000 drawings. Yes, it was the best of times.

India was still recovering from the excitement of the Beatles visiting Rishikesh. Ravi Shankar was storming the West, with Yehudi Menuhin at times, with John Lennon other times. Rajneesh was shocking Bombay with his spiritual sermons on free sex.

Dylan’s harmonica rang in our ears as Blowing’ in the Wind played everywhere. Madhubala had just passed away. Zubin Mehta was conducting the LA Philharmonic. And I? I was smoking hash with Ginsberg and listening to Howl ‘midst the smell of burning flesh as funeral pyres lit up Calcutta’s night sky. Or strolling home at daybreak with the great Ustad after a nightlong concert. No, no one could sing the Malkauns like Amir Khan did.

We were all young then, full of anger and hope. We dreamt of a just world. We believed poverty could be fought and defeated. Che with his trademark beret stared down at us from red posters, though very few among us were actually Red. It was azaadi we yearned for. We protested against the Gulag as loudly as we raised our voice against Mai Lai.

I quit college. Not for politics but for poetry. Poetry, for me, was hope. It was azaadi from the tired clichés of politics. I started a magazine that brought together the best voices. Agyeya and Faiz, Muktibodh and Yevtushenko, Octavio Paz.

Brewing next door was a war. The young students of East Bengal took on the Pakistani army with the poetry of Shamsur Rahman echoing in their hearts: Freedom is a voice everyone hears; freedom is a voice everyone fears. I remember Kaifi telling students in Dhaka that poetry alone can win the war for them.

Around that time, a young man quit his job in Calcutta and caught a train to Bombay to try his luck at the movies. KA Abbas gave him his first break. But it took him a few more years and a film with Rajesh Khanna to be noticed.

A script by two young men, Salim and Javed defined his real role: the role of the Angry Young Man ready to set the skies on fire in his pursuit of hope and justice. It started with a small film called Zanjeer but soon went well beyond cinema. It defined the indomitable spirit of the seventies and raised its richest baritone: Rage.

The rhetoric of non violence had already tired. The young were seeking hope, a new Utopia in a world without answers. Doubt and dilemma dogged them. That is when Bachchan picked up the gauntlet and showed them the way out. India found a new hero. He stood up for the weak and the poor. He fought against injustice and crime. And yes, he was violent when violence was required. He was the new moral compass, the voice that whispered in our ears: Fight back.

The long war in Vietnam had ended. Free Bangladesh was born by the will of its young writers and poets. And India showed it will not cower before the Emergency, come what may. It was a reassertion of our will. The left, the right, everyone got together to fight back the darkness. Till Mrs Gandhi submitted to the will of the people.

The eighties came with the assassination of John Lennon. Andrei Sakharov was arrested in Moscow. The Rubik’s Cube arrived. So did the first 24 hours news channel by CNN. Mrs Gandhi returned to power. Mikhail Gorbachev broke the Kremlin’s grip. The USSR was no more the USSR. Pac-Man took Japan by storm. Led Zeppelin broke up. And Uttam Kumar died. So did Mohammed Rafi. And Sahir.

By then I had married again. The Emergency was over. Mrs Gandhi was back in power just one day before my birthday. Naxalbari was also over. My poetry gave way to journalism.

Two years later, Kapil brought home the World Cup. I moved to Bombay. Amitabh won an election and went to Parliament. (I made the same mistake a decade later.) Bofors broke out. And the world as we knew it had changed forever.

The seventies was about freedom, hope, courage. Each one of us against the world, living out our bravest moment. Will that ever come back again? I doubt it."
Shraddha Took A Pay Cut To Star In 'Saaho' With Prabhas & The Pay-Gap Between Them Is Whopping!,"Prabhas became a star in the eyes of the entire world with just one project, the magnum opus Baahubali. And since the time the second part of the movie has released, people have been longing to see his next film. And more than that, fans are excited to know who he is paired alongside.

After a lot of speculations and so many names doing the rounds, it was revealed that Bollywood actress Shraddha Kapoor has been roped in for the role, but fans were apparently disappointed by the same.

But did you know that Shraddha Kapoor was approached for the role earlier as well? In fact, she was one of the few first choices of the filmmaker. But since she, reportedly, demanded a huge sum of money, things didn’t work out.

It is said that Shraddha had demanded Rs 12 crore. Since the movie is going to be shot in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi simultaneously, hence, Shraddha who takes Rs 4 crore for a Hindi film, demanded thrice the amount.

Now that she has signed the deal, wondering how much she is getting paid? Rumour has it that the actress has taken a pay-cut and is taking home Rs 9 crore.

#Prabhas #stylish #prabhasraju #darlingprabhas #instadaily #photooftheday 😎 A post shared by Srikanth Prabhas (@srikanth4prabhas) on Aug 15, 2017 at 8:32pm PDT

Curious to know what’s Prabhas’ remuneration for the movie is? If reports are to be believed, the handsome hunk is taking Rs 30 crore. And that’s more than triple the amount Shraddha is taking.

“Saaho will be shot in Mumbai, Abu Dhabi and Romania and every character in the film has many shades but Prabhas himself will be seen in a never-seen-before avatar and will be seen doing lots of modern-day action and will be undergoing training,” a source told Pinkvilla.

The movie also stars Neil Nitin Mukesh in a villainous role, and he has promised that Saaho is going to be the biggest action film of 2018.

Basketball Star LeBron James Calls Donald Trump A ‘So-Called President’ During A Charity Event,"LeBron James can wreak havoc on the basketball court. He can make the best of players in the world look stupid with his three-pointers and crazy ass dunks. And he's equally threatening off the field. He proved - with of course, high swag level - by referring to Donald Trump as a 'so-called President' at a charity event.

Twitter

He further went on to urge everyone at the event to put their best foot forward to change the society for better.

Twitter

Here's what his entire speech was:

""Lastly and last before I get off stage, before we all get off stage, I know there's a lot of tragic things hapening in Charlottesville. I just want to speak on it right now. I have this platform and I'm somebody that has a voice of command and the only way for us to get better as a society and for us to get better as people is love. And that's the only way we're going to be able to conquer something as one. It's not about the guy that's the so-called president of the United States, or whatever the case. It's not about a teacher that you don't feel like cares about what's going on with you every day. It's not about the people you just don't feel like want to give the best energy and effort to you. It's about us. It's about us looking in the mirror. Kids all the way up to adults. All of us looking in the mirror and saying, 'What can we do better to help change?' And if we can all do that and give 110 percent and give both foots forward, then that's all you can ask for. So, shout out to the innocent people in Charlottesville and shout out to everybody across the world that just want to be great and just want to love. Thank you, and I love you all.""

The Eternal Quest,"Many aspirants begin their spiritual journey with great enthusiasm but somewhere along the way, they slow down or get confused. GURUDEVSHRI RAKESHBHAI says the pause helps you scrutinise your religious activities and understand your true intentions



Pursuit of liberation begins with a desire for it.However, one wonders if man has the genuine desire for it.He is easily satisfied doing a few religious activities, and although he expects liberation, he lacks a genuine desire for it. Generally, one eats food when one feels hungry. But in our modern-day pseudo-lifestyle, meal times are fixed. You never ask the body whether it is hungry or not.You know it is time to eat, so you eat. Such ‘hunger’ can be false. Mere thinking about mealtimes can make you falsely believe that you are hungry. Try this experiment.Ask someone at home to turn the clock to make it an hour early so it shows 1 pm, your regular mealtime, when it is actually noon. Looking at the clock, you will spontaneously feel hungry! Now, try making it an hour late so it shows noon when it is actually 1 pm. On that day, you will feel hungry later! If looking at the clock determines your hunger,your hunger is artificial;it is not real.It is only a mental need,not physical.In the same way,religious activities without a yearning for liberation are only mental demands, not the need of the soul; they are emotional outbursts triggered by external circumstances.



You Want Both



Dig a little deeper into your desire for light and you will realise that you want both, the illumination of enlightenment and the darkness of worldliness. On the one hand, you say you don’t need the world, that you want only the bliss of the soul.Yet, for happiness, you run towards the world. In short, you don’t wish to become free from darkness, yet you wait for illumination to happen. Don’t you realise that without wanting to remove the darkness,you cannot light your lamp? First, realise that you actually want darkness alone.You have always hoped to acquire joy from darkness alone and fear that illumination will shatter your dream world.You love worldliness alone, yet you believe, and make others believe that you want liberation. You speak of liberation but to become happy, instead of bringing changes in yourself, you try changing the world.You speak of liberation only to comfortably live in the world. How will you light the lamp if you are so attached to darkness? Even if someone tries to light it for you, you soon blow it out.Even when someone shows compassion towards you, it does not make a difference.You are in love with darkness and wish to live in that alone. Enlightened ones have showered compassion upon you in the past.The sun itself has come knocking at your door, but you choose to hide in your darkness.You know that with light,your desire and hope from darkness will be destroyed. So you fear light.As long as you have even a bit of inclination to acquire from darkness,you will not let the lamp be illumined. You are so dishonest that you are not ready to accept the way you are.You do not want to accept that, ‘I want to live in darkness alone. I want happiness from worldly objects and events.’You join those who speak about light and show how interested you are in it, but you want to live in darkness alone. If you accept that you are merely talking about light and are not really interested in it,one can find a way out.You love darkness but you want to show that you are a lover of light.You can’t give up your attraction of being called religious for there is reputation and honour associated with it. Your attraction for this honour linked with religiousness makes you start pretending to be religious.You actually use religion to hide your flaws.Showing aspiration for illumination,you continue to hide your delusion. Your cry for light is merely to hide your passion for darkness.There is no inner transformation. You still want to make changes in the outside to gain joy and peace. There were two friends fishing on the banks of a lake. Seeing the lake-supervisor approach, one of the friends started running.The supervisor chased him, caught him after a mile and a half and said,“You will be prosecuted for fishing without a fishing licence.”The man immediately took out his licence from his pocket and showed it to the supervisor.The supervisor was surprised and said, “If you had the licence, why did you run?”The man said,“I had the licence, but my friend didn’t!” This man ran far away from the spot so that his friend could escape and hide.The same thing happens in your mental world.To conceal your wrong inclinations,you act pious.This is the ‘benefit’ of being ‘religious’ without truly yearning for liberation! No one will doubt you. If you want transformation, catch your desires. Go to their roots. Start accepting your flaws.That is the first step towards liberation.



Stop Self-deception



Many approach me for learning how to meditate because they want inner peace. But they show no enthusiasm in fulfilling the conditions necessary for meditation. Only a true customer is ready to pay the price, for he knows the real value of liberation.If you want liberation without paying its price, you are a beggar asking,‘teach me meditation, give me satsang, show me the means.’ But when it comes to putting anything at stake, you withdraw. You complain that ‘I have a lot of difficulties.Once everything is set,I will begin the pursuit of liberation.’Amidst the chase for wealth,power, family, status, reputation, you are stranded. Stop deceiving yourself — if you genuinely desired liberation,you would have given up everything and worked for liberation alone.



Turn Within



Only when you turn within, you experience bliss. A mind wandering outside can never be happy or peaceful. It gets sorrow wherever it goes. In spite of wealth,status,relations you have remained unhappy and wounded within. As long as you are living with the belief that,‘I will get happiness from the other’,you will remain sorrowful.Happiness is your nature, so by focusing within and staying steady within, you will experience it. If happiness were to come from the other,why haven’t you found it till now? Many times you have extended your begging bowl in front of others, and sometimes had some good fortune too,yet,why have you not been happy? Don’t you realise that those you beg from are beggars themselves, begging from you and others? If indeed they had happiness,why would they demand from you? All in the world are asking for happiness, yet no one is seen receiving it because asking itself is a mistake. By asking,you continue being outside. You forget that what you are asking is your own inherent nature.What is missing is identification with it. Turn towards the Source,your true Self, for happiness is religion; to turn outwards for happiness is being irreligious. None have ever gained happiness from outside, and those who have turned within have never failed to experience bliss.Even though their ways have been different — some by dancing, some by sitting in meditation,some through devotion and some through knowledge, but the direction was the same,for their destination was the same, the Self.Where there is forgetfulness of the Self, there is suffering.Where there is awareness of the Self, there is bliss. By remaining outside, you will gain nothing, and by turning within, nothing will remain to gain.

Indian Railways is headed towards a bleak future,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a soft corner for Indian Railways. His early association with railways is well known. What is perhaps not widely known is that when he visits his parliamentary constituency, Varanasi, he opts to stay in the Railway Guest House.

“As the Prime Minister, I can stay somewhere else but I prefer the Railway Guest House as it gives a feel of belonging,” he told a group of railway officials last year.

This sense of belonging, however, stops short of extending support for railways in one of its most challenging phases.

A look at a parliamentary standing committee report on railways, which was finalized by BJP’s Ganesh Singh, shows that railways may have a bleak future.

For long, railways has suffered on account of incoherent policies. The incoherence in policymaking remains intact in the Modi era too.

Freight remains the mainstay of railways’ revenue. Within freight, coal is the most important commodity that is moved around the country.

According to the parliamentary standing committee report, on average railways runs up a cost of Rs 0.99 per 10 kilometers but charges its customers Rs 1.60. This surplus is used to cross-subsidize passenger traffic where the average cost is Rs 0.73 per 10 kilometers against a charge of Rs 0.36.

This economic model rests on railways’ being able to protect its freight business.

Last year, railways’ performance in freight business was below par. Not only is it pricing itself out of business in order to meet its obligations to transport passengers, recent changes in government policy have not helped.

This is where the incoherence which characterizes economic policy makes matters worse. Power plants, which are the main consumers of coal, are now encouraged to locate themselves close to coal mines to reduce their costs. It certainly makes sense from the standpoint of a power plant, but what does it do to the railways?

Here, another recent development harms railways.

After 93 years, the railway budget was merged with the main budget this year. One of the consequences, as pointed out in standing committee report, is that operating losses incurred by railways on strategic lines and lines in hilly, coastal and backward areas will not be reimbursed to them.

This is very odd. Railways will not be allowed to conduct operations that make sense from a commercial standpoint. That is fair enough if their role is seen as something that goes beyond narrow commercial considerations. This automatically means that government should reimburse them for some of their work. However, it appears that the government is disinclined to do so which makes for a bleak future.

Prime Minister Modi should therefore consider the following suggestion from the parliamentary standing committee:

“Sufficient gross budgetary support should be provided to railways every year keeping in view their various socio-economic commitments including strategic lines.”"
"Amateur Boxer, Intern, Traveler - Here’s How Maria Sharapova Spent Her Time Away From Tennis","Maria Sharapova is not just a tennis player. She's a supermodel, an entertainer with a wacky sense of humour and also a business owner. When the World Anti Doping Agency slammed a ban on her for consuming contentious substance meldonium, everyone wondered how she would keep herself busy. But she did manage to remain in the limelight by hook or by crook.

Now that she's all set to return to the tennis court with a wild card entry at the US Open, we bring you all the dope on what Maria was up to for so long

Internship With The NBA In Manhattan

Twitter

Basketball after tennis? Really? Was she really mulling over a switch in sport discipline? Soon after the ban was imposed, Sharapova was spotted in Manhattan for a three-day internship with the National Basketball Association. She worked closely with NBA commissioner Adam Silver. Moreover, she also gained some work experience at an advertising agency in London. She was working with VCCP in central London.

Back To Student Life

Twitter

Maria already owns a business line called Sugarpova. And picking up more business skills is highly imperative. So she joined the Harvard Business School. She took to Facebook to announce her entry into the school. She said, """"Another day at school, and another 5.30 am wake up call. Here I am checking out the campus and getting my morning fix.""

Amateur Boxer. Well...

During her ban days, she dared to glove-up and post a photo on Instagram where he is seen packing a punch. We almost expected her to hit the ring.

Travel is part of Maria's professional life. She travels to USA, Britain, France and Australia for obvious reasons. But as she waited for her ban to be lifted, she went around the world - Italy and New York being her pick of the destinations.

Now where would Maria travel? US Open, of course."

"Meet The Bhasins, A Unique Family Of Pilots That Has Clocked 100 Years Of Flights Together!","Crisp whites, peak caps, flight bags, four stripes on their shoulders, and an unmatched love for flying are the constants for three generations of Bhasins, a unique aviator family.

Five members of the family -- both parents, two children and their late grandfather -- have clocked 100 years of flying among them. That's right, not 100 hours, but 100 years. That's 8,76,000 hours of flight time!

PTI

The grandfather and the pioneer in the family, Captain Jai Dev Bhasin, was among the first seven pilots in the country to become a commander in 1954. When his future daughter-in-law Nivedita Jain joined his company, Indian Airlines, she was the third woman to do so. Today, she and her husband Captain Rohit Bhasin are proud parents of two young commanders, Rohan and Niharika Bhasin.

""Flying fascinated me for as long as I can remember. Maybe when I was as young as six or seven,"" recalls the matriarch, Nivedita Jain, 54.

Her face lights up recounting the most important day of her life as if it were yesterday. ""I was at a friend's birthday party when my father came running with an appointment letter for me from Indian Airlines. The day is etched in my memory. It was June 29, 1984,"" she says. She was just 20 when she received the letter and in the next 11 years, went on to achieve her most cherished career milestones. At 26, already a mother of a one-year-old, she received her command on a Boeing 737, becoming the youngest woman captain of a jet plane in the world. Seven years later when she became a commander on Airbus 300, one of the bigger air craft then in the world and also the first-ever wide-body aircraft, it would be the culmination of her dreams.

PTI

She also became a trendsetter when she co-piloted the world's first ever all-woman crew flight with a Fokker Friendship aircraft on the Calcutta-Silchar route in 1985.

Her feats set her apart and her children say they were in awe of her from their early days.

""As a a child I used to keep looking at her while she was getting ready for work and I really wanted to dress up like that one day,"" says Niharika, 26, who has been flying with IndiGo for over four years and received her command on the Airbus A320 recently. Not having their parents around all the time during their childhood did not bother the siblings as it was the only normal they knew. That has changed since they started flying.

BCCL

""I realise now how difficult it would have been to coordinate flying and bringing up two children. They made it seem so smooth, but in all honesty it's not,"" Niharika says.

Nivedita Bhasin was the first pilot in her company to become a mother and it was in the years following her first child that the company instituted a policy on maternity leave. The mother admits that there were times she thought of quitting the profession, especially when her children were nearing adolescence, but she was not ready to give up on a dream she had struggled to achieve. That dream and passion were passed on to the offspring, who say that the thought of pursuing any other career never crossed their minds.

Sarahah Creator Is Thankful Of Indians Who Taught Him Programming & Proud They're Using The App,"You’ve likely heard of Sarahah by now, seen a few posts shared by friends, maybe even tried out the app yourself. In fact, you may even be tired of all the shenanigans Sarahah's causing. But there’s at least one more detail that should interest you.

The Saudi Arabian developer who created the app, Zain al-Abdin Tawfiq, says he was actually set on his way by Indian programmers.

In an interview with India Today, Tawfiq mentioned how happy he was that Sarahah eventually reached India. “The first company that I worked for, actually the only IT company that I ever worked for, was Wipro. And I am very proud and happy to see Indians coming to Sarahah. Indians have taught me programming in university, Indians have taught me programming in the company.”

Tawfiq also says his team has a lot of features planned for the app in future, though he didn’t elaborate. However, he’s also forced to touch on the privacy concerns surrounding the app. After all, people are worried about their identities being revealed on an app where they’re given the benefit of remaining anonymous. Tawfiq insists the app will never reveal the identity of a message sender unless they have their permission, except in cases where their terms of service are violated.

There’s really no saying just how long Sarahah will remain in the spotlight. And if it does eventually fade, will Tawfiq be able to reinvent himself and push forward another app of his design? Only time will tell.

Bullying madrasas to celebrate Independence Day is all kinds of oxymoronic,"Inbound VP Venkaiah Naidu has disagreed with outbound VP Hamid Ansari over “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity” creeping in among the minorities in India. Naidu says this kind of talk is just political propaganda. He says “compared to the entire world, minorities are more safe and secure in India and they get their due.” Perhaps the disagreement is over what exactly is “their due”. Selective food bans, anti-conversion and ghar wapsi crusades, vigilantism and ‘beef’ lynchings?

Priti Gandhi, national executive member of the BJP Mahila Morcha, has a more aggressive challenge for Ansari: “For 10 years my Hindu majority nation accepted you with open arms, placed you at the pinnacle of power and you still feel uneasy. Agenda kya hai?” Perhaps the agenda is educating the “Hindu majority” about how its condescension is neither fair nor merited. How dare you expect minorities to act as supplicants or servile? Listen up your citizenship is not of a higher order.

In its very first year the Modi government had caused a great upset by declaring Christmas Day as Good Governance Day. This year it selected Good Friday as Digital India Day. It’s true that India’s religious calendar is very crowded but it’s also true that Diwali hasn’t been declared Ujjwala Bharat Diwas for which maybe all schools and government offices could stay open. Holi also remains a holiday. The discrimination is manifest.

And now even Independence Day is being sullied. In Uttar Pradesh state-aided madrassas have been told to submit video footage of Independence Day functions to minority welfare officers in all districts of the state. Going back to Ansari’s point, surely this kind of blatant targeting is cause for “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity” among the minorities. The show of distrust can hardly engender trust.

BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao has said with a tellingly raw crudeness, “At a time when the spectre of radical Islam is a threat to the community, Muslims should welcome the move rather than place religion over nation. Respect for national symbols is non-negotiable.” This is such a shamelessly majoritarian party line. Telling Muslims what they should feel (grateful). Setting “non-negotiable” conditions for their Indianness. And of course using the spectre of radical Islam to try to push the minority into a meek corner. But bullying someone into celebrating Independence Day is all kinds of oxymoronic. It kind of rubs in an absence of freedoms. And that is sound reason for “a feeling of unease, a sense of insecurity”."
"‘Look, I’m so secular!’ The rise of virtue signallers on social media","The rise of social media in the past few years has meant that a lot of public opinion is debated, discussed and shaped on forums like Twitter and Facebook, and even thousands of local WhatsApp groups. One would imagine these powerful tools that connect millions can enable us to distill the best opinions on an issue, which can then shape our response to them.

However, there is a huge problem. These discussion forums are public. And in public, a lot of people are fake. They want to be seen as good, proper, balanced, modern and progressive. Most of all, they want to be seen as virtuous. If I can come across as a person who has these wonderful qualities to my 200-odd Facebook, Twitter or WhatsApp friends, it is more valuable than actually saying what I feel on the issue.

In this context, a term called ‘virtue signalling’ has become popular on the internet recently, although it was used in a few articles several years ago. But it is only now that you see virtue signalling on full display.

Try this. Mention that “I don’t feel safe sending my parents on Amarnath Yatra after Muslim terrorists killed Hindu pilgrims.” Chances are several people out there will scream ‘communal! communal!’ to your statement before you even understand what on earth happened.

You see, these people have to show that they are so virtuous, so noble, and so good that they sense something is communal even when others don’t. Of course, there is nothing wrong in your original statement, as you are stating a fear based on an incident that has occurred.

However, the virtuous lot on the internet will demand that a) you don’t mention any religion at all ever, b) as Hindus are in majority, we must never raise an issue that affects Hindus because that makes us majoritarians and c) a truly virtuous person will not see this as an act against Hindus, but merely some bad people trying to hurt some good people and that is all that needs to be mentioned.

Of course, that is not how the human mind works or thinks. The fact remains that many Hindus will now think twice about sending their elderly parents to pilgrimage sites, particularly in Kashmir. However unsavoury, this needs to be discussed. How can we have a country where the majority of people feel unsafe about going to their places of worship? Is it communal to discuss this issue and come up with solutions?

According to the virtue signallers, it is. Your mentioning the word Hindu, let alone an issue that affects only Hindus, will brand you as communal. This is because by doing so, they come across as virtuous. When they attack you in anger, they are saying, ‘Look, I am such a secular person that the mere mention of the word Hindu makes me mad. Look, I am so good and secular that any hint of a Hindu issue makes me seethe with anger. And now that I have shown I am more virtuous, I have the right to attack the others. My goodness gives me sanction to abuse, insult and be rude to anyone else who isn’t that virtuous.’

We sometimes mistakenly refer to these people in India as fake-liberals, pseudo-seculars or elitists. All they are doing is virtue signalling, showing how modern and progressive they are — so they look good to their virtual peers.

Hence, take a statement like, “Although we must have laws to protect women, some men are suffering due to fake domestic violence or fake harassment cases because some people are abusing the laws (something any lawyer or policeman dealing in such cases will attest).” Virtue signallers will jump on this and feast all day, calling it ‘sexist, anti-women, backward or whatever else’ because when you say that, you show that you are so equality-conscious.

Virtue signallers operate in many other arenas. They show their support for women’s cricket in their social feeds (though chances are they have never watched a women’s cricket match on TV in their lives).

Virtue signallers want to promote independent cinema over commercial cinema (though they don’t go and watch independent cinema in theatres). Virtue signallers want to show that they care about Dalits and Muslims, not because they actually care about Dalits and Muslims or do anything about it, but because stating so makes you look good on social media.

Beware of such utterly fake people, and avoid engaging in debate with them. They will tire and bore you to death with statements that don’t answer the issue at hand, but merely make them look good.

Virtue signalling is a reality of today’s social media. Because whenever we feel judged by a lot of people, we hide our true self and try to look good. It’s noise on the internet and, like trolls, must be ignored. We must debate issues by saying things as they are, for only then can a solution be found."
Facebook & Instagram Will Be Rolling Out Tweaked Newsfeed & Comments To Make Them Easier To Use,"Facebook is has announced a redesign for its two most popular apps, Facebook and Instagram. The two are both receiving changes to make them more visually appealing, as well as easier to comprehend at first glance.

Facebook is losing the blue header and trims across most of the app’s interface, which they’re saying will make it easier to navigate and more consistent. Additionally, the comments are being changed to look more like chats in Messenger. Instead simple line breaks, each comment will get its own gray bubble

Even profile pictures are changing from squares to circles, more like how Twitter’s design is. Lastly, the Like, Comment, and Share buttons have been made slightly larger, to make them easier to click, and are being decolorised save for an outline.

Instagram meanwhile, has its redesign focused on comments. Comments on each image will now be organised into threads, just like on the Facebook app. That way, differentiating between a new comment and a reply to someone else’s comment should be easier."
Food For Thought: Let’s make the Independence Day feast an annual ritual,"On this 71st Independence Day, there are many things we need to be proud of and many things we still need to work on. And one of the things we need to work on is celebrating Independence Day. According to me, Independence Day celebrations today are great insofar as they evoke the spirit of nationalism, love for the flag and remind us of the sacrifices of our freedom fighters who laid down their lives so that we could experience the fruits of independence. However, these celebrations can be very sombre. We as a young nation need to have fun as we reaffirm our Indian identity.

Again, I don’t mean any disrespect to rituals such as hoisting of the national flag, singing patriotic songs and listening to the Prime Minister’s speech at Red Fort. All of these things will continue. But we need rituals that organically bring us together as people. Independence Day should be as much about euphoria as it should be about respect. One fun Independence Day ritual that is slowly dying out is kite flying. In the years gone by, August 15 was a day that saw kites obscure the sky in many parts of the country. It was a joyous activity that transcended religion, caste, ethnicity and localities. However, the youth these days have failed to inherit this tradition, being preoccupied with other leisurely pursuits.

Hence, we find ourselves in a situation where we need another fun-filled Independence Day ritual. And in my opinion, a replacement can be found in Independence Day feasting. People coming together on Independence Day to share food is a fantastic way to strengthen communal harmony and assert our Indianness. Since food is an essential pillar of culture, what better way is there to reflect the diversity of India than through a feast that represents its myriad regional cuisines? And the more diverse the backgrounds of our friends and family members are, the richer our feast will be.

In fact, an Independence Day potluck feast is the perfect symbol of India’s unity in diversity. Such a feast also gives us an opportunity to reflect on our shared destiny as a people. Besides, when people sit and eat together, their differences of opinion and politics take a back seat. It breaks down the feeling of otherness and replaces this with bonds of friendship. This is all the more needed in today’s highly politicised atmosphere where questions of identity have become complicated.

Plus, an Independence Day feast will be a ritual that people don’t need to stress about. There are no questions of whether one is patriotic enough. If you are hosting such a feat on Independence Day, sharing delicious food with your friends and family, and spreading general warmth and love, you are as Indian as one can be."
ISRO Scientists Make Their First Music Video To Celebrate India's 70th Independence Day,"A bunch of scientists from Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has made their first music video. While, during the day, they study rocket science, at night the 20-something-member band, 'ROCK@Band' busies itself with making music.

youtube/sgt compositions

Their video has been released on YouTube ahead of India's 70th Independence Day.

The patriotic video, made mostly in Malayalam, talks about building a new India and putting an end to violence. It also seeks to boost the morale of their fellows at ISRO who are preparing for Chandrayaan-2, scheduled for launch early next year. The video inculcates an animation of the tricolour being placed on the moon as well.

It took the scientists 18 months to shoot the video where they spent Rs. 10,000 from their own pockets. The project is fully supported by the Space Engineers Association (SEA), reports NDTV.

The entire video was shot on the Arabian Sea coast and came about as a part of the recreational activities supported by the SEA.

Diving Into The Spirit World,"Many great 20th century scientists have been drawn to the spirit world, writes MUKUL SHARMA



The end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth saw some extremely radical and revolutionary developments in modern science in the form of electromagnetism, relativity and quantum mechanics. In the light of this, one would imagine that the age of superstition, irrationality and old wives’ tales — not to mention ghosts — would technically come to an end. But nothing of the kind actually happened.On the contrary, a lot of well-known scientists (including a few Nobel laureates), rational thinkers and eminent statesmen almost immediately dived deeply into the spirit world. From both sides of the Atlantic, from recognisably advanced nations of the time like England, France and the United States, reports started steadily streaming in that some ‘gifted’ people were being able to go into a trance and summon up or even speak directly to the spirits of the dead.Others were apparently able to enter into an altered state of consciousness and write things dictated by remote entities in what was then fashionably known as ‘automatic writing’ or as it’s still called today, ‘channelling’.



Some of these outpourings were touted to be the latest works of deceased writers and musicians describing new works of theirs such as unknown plays of Shakespeare and Bacon or new compositions by Mozart and Beethoven. In India too in the early 1900s, a Sanskrit manuscript surfaced called Vaimanika Shastra or ‘Science of Aeronautics’ which was purportedly dictated to a ‘seer’ by the name of Pandit Subbaraya Shastry who claimed it was psychically delivered to him by the ancient Hindu sage Bhardwaj and contained mention of advanced aerodynamic flying vehicles in use in Vedic times. Bizarre as it may sound though, a lot of men of science and other research streams began flocking in droves to these séances apparently to study their veridicality, thinking it might be the next great breakthrough in their respective fields. Parapsychologists came to check out instances of telepathy and clairvoyance, reincarnation researchers wanted to see if disincarnate souls could exist and people who believed in flying saucers and ancient alien astronauts thought they might find evidence for their theories. Everything ultimately came to nothing. Either the mediums were exposed as hoaxes who cleverly fooled the gullible — including J J Thompson, the discoverer of the electron,physicist Oliver Lodge, and Balfour, the later prime minister of England — or they themselves admitted their chicanery.



For instance, the famous Fox sister mediums publicly acknowledged they were faking the whole thing while Leonora Piper was exposed by a professional magician. In which connection, the so-called Vaimanika Shastra manuscript along with the various sketches in it was also investigated by the aeronautical and mechanical engineering researchers at the Indian Institute of Science,Bangalore in 1974. Their conclusion was simple: it was nonsense. They said that the aircrafts described in the text were ‘poor concoctions’ and that the author showed a complete lack of understanding of aeronautics. Of one particular flying machine, the Rukma Vimana, the study noted: “If the craft is taken to mean what the drawing and the text say,it can be stated that the craft is a decided impossibility.” However, having said that and, hopefully, in the process defrocking the occult ilk, let’s skip a few decades to 1930.That was the year the Pulitzer Prize winning American author Upton Sinclair wrote Mental Radio: Does it work, and how? It documents Sinclair’s test of the psychic abilities of Mary Craig, his second wife, while she was in a state of profound depression with a heightened interest in the occult. She attempted to duplicate 290 pictures which were drawn by her brother. Sinclair claimed Mary successfully duplicated 65 of them, with 155 ‘partial successes’ and 70 failures. Yet what’s the bet most of us would never guess — Albert Einstein wrote the preface to this book. ¦"
The Google Pixel 2 Will Do Certain Things When You Hold It In Your Hand And Squeeze It Hard,"With recent leaks, we’ve seen for sure that the Pixel 2’s display won’t be nearly as fancy as the larger Pixel 2 XL. However, FCC filings from HTC revealed a few other intriguing features from the smaller flagship device to come out from Google.

By the looks of things, HTC is bringing over is “squeeze” mechanic from the U11, which let the phone perform specific functions when you applied pressure to its side edges. In the Pixel 2, it’s being called ‘active Edge’, with a sample screenshot included in the filing showing that the default function is to activate the Google Assistant.

A few other details have also emerged, like the fact that the Pixel 2 is definitely being manufactured by HTC, though the Pixel 2 XL is being rumoured to come from LG. Last year, both the Pixel and Pixel XL were HTC-manufactured

Since the timing of this and last year’s FCC filing coincides, it seems to indicate Google’s latest flagships will only arrive sometime in October. Fingers crossed that there are no unfortunate delays."

Rohit intends a ""behind the scene"" role as India's new ODI deputy

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 05:28 PM

Rohit Sharma, the India ODI team's newly-appointed vice-captain, said he was honoured to be named the deputy to Virat Kohli for the upcoming ODI series against Sri Lanka. He also added that the role will be a little bit more backstage compared to what he does with the Mumbai Indians, where he is the captain.

""It is a huge honour to be appointed as the vice-captain,"" Rohit said after the team's optional practice session in Pallekele on Wednesday (August 16). ""Ten years ago, I was only thinking of playing for India. Being the vice-captain now feels really, really good. It's a kind of honour that whenever the opportunity comes - the first One-Dayer, when we come [play] on August 20 - there will be some sort of role that I will need to play, and I am looking forward to it. I am not thinking too much about it, I just want to enjoy the moment as of now. Yes, it will be a good opportunity for me to get on to the field.

""It's a different ball game completely. IPL and when you come and play international cricket, it is completely different. But again, the excitement and the energy level is the same. So yes, nothing changes too much. I am the vice-captain here, there I was the captain, so I was more in front. Here I have to play a little behind-the-scene role. But yes, I will be very excited to step on to the field as the vice-captain of the Indian team.""

Rohit was one of the three players who turned up for the optional practice session, alongside KL Rahul and Axar Patel. The opener was seen playing a number of sweeps and reverse-sweeps against the net bowlers. Rohit hinted that the shots were part of a plan to counter Lasith Malinga.

""Everyday is a learning day, today I got to learn something playing those sweeps and reverse-sweeps when someone like Malinga comes and bowls to you. It is something that the game demands these days. You got to be innovative and you got to play different kind of shots to get maximum results. You keep learning every day and I keep trying these things and learn about things I can do and things I cannot do. Every addition to your armoury is good and I am trying to see what I can add to my armoury. What better place than coming here and doing it; that's what training sessions are all about. Come here, improve your skills, and try and get better as a player,"" he added.

Speaking about India's opponents, Sri Lanka, Rohit said they were a dangerous side, as evidenced by their victory over India in the Champions Trophy, but added that India would look to stick to their strengths.

""I have no idea about the squad for this ODI series, but what they had in the Champions Trophy was a very good side. They beat us quite comfortably. So you know in One-Day cricket, they are a very good team. We just got to do what we have been doing for the past few years. We got to stick to our strength.

""We have been playing good cricket. West Indies was good, Champions Trophy was good except for one day - but that can happen - but in the past two years, we have played some consistent cricket in the ODI format. As far as I am concerned, we need to look at what we need to do as a team and bring out the best on the field. That's what we did in the recent Test series. We just focused on what we need to do as a group and that has always been the talk. We need to focus on our ability and strengths,"" he said.

Is Corporate Governance a mere mirage,"The proposal for approval of appointment of Mr. Deepak Kapoor, former Chairman of Pricewaterhousecoopers India (pwc) as an Independent Director of Tata Steel had already come in from severe criticism from no less than Mr. J.N. Gupta, former Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Mr. Gupta was quoted saying that, “In our advisory note, we have asked shareholders to reject either of the appointment as there seems to be a conflict of interest if both proposals go through at once. Kapoor will disqualify as an independent director under section 149(6) of the Companies Act, if PwC is appointed as its auditor.” Mr. Gupta, further said that both Kapoor and PwC’s appointments together “does not reflect good governance practice by the Tatas.” The “mere presence” of Kapoor on the board of Tata Steel “may have an adverse impact on the audit process and may give rise to ethical issues,” he had added.

Yet, the appointment of Mr. Deepak Kapoor was approved in the annual general meeting (AGM) of Tata Steel held on August 8, 2017. In the same AGM, the appointment of Price Waterhouse & Co Chartered Accountants LLP (Audit firm) was also approved. Is it conceivable that TATAs, known for their high “value systems”, grossly erred in making the two appointments ? The facts, unfortunately, suggest so.

As per the Notice of AGM, Mr. Kapoor met the criteria for independence as provided for in Section 149(6) of the Companies Act, 2013 and had also given a declaration to that effect. Is it possible that Mr. Deepak Kapoor gave a wrong declaration to Tata Steel ?

The real question boils down to whether provisions of Section 149(6)(e)(ii) were violated. This section provides, amongst others, that an Independent Director shall mean such a person who, neither himself nor any of his relatives is or has been an employee or proprietor or a partner, in any of the three financial years immediately preceding the financial year in which he is proposed to be appointed of a firm of auditors or company secretaries in practice or cost auditors of the company or its holding, subsidiary or associate company. The intention behind this disqualification is extremely important and abundantly clear : no person, who or whose relatives were employed by the auditors of the company during the last 3 years could be appointed as its Independent Director. Cooling period of 3 years was stipulated to avoid any potential conflict of interest.

Before I analyse any further, I must put a caveat; the analysis is as per my understanding of the law, is meant purely for the larger public interest and is not in any way whatsoever meant to reflect on the competence or otherwise of any individual or entity involved. A technical correction must also be made. The Audit firm appointed in the AGM is not Pwc but Price Waterhouse & Co Chartered Accountants LLP. The legal distinction needs to be appreciated.

Deepak Kapoor had been with Pwc India for 30 years and had initially served as an Audit partner. He went on to serve as the Chairman of Pwc India from 1st January 2011 upto 31 December 2016. Prior to this, he had served as the Managing Director of Pwc India for nearly 4 years since February 2007. The vital questions which arise are that what is Pwc India comprised of and what was Mr. Kapoor’s authority and control over its different constituents?

For the benefit of everyone, Pwc India refers to the network of a private limited company by the name of Pricewaterhousecoopers Private Limited (pwcpl) that renders Advisory services and more than 10-12 audit firms. All these supposedly separate legal entities use the same brand name, i.e., Pwc. It needs no emphasis that by being at the helm of affairs of Pwc India for nearly 12 years Mr. Deepak Kapoor had significant influence and control over the entire network including all the audit firms, including the one appointed as the Auditor of Tata Steel in the said AGM, although he was on the rolls of Pwcpl only.

SEBI’s regulations for Independent Directors are still wider. Even a material supplier, service provider, lessor or lessee to the company, irrespective of the value involved, is disqualified from being appointed as an Independent Director of the Company.

The intention of the lawmakers while formulating the law is invariably considered by the Courts to arrive at the right interpretation for any specific provision. The lawmakers probably thought that they have extensively and elaborately covered all situations that could result in conflict of interest. Apparently, they under-estimated or overlooked the ingenuity of some. What the Pwc India network stands for may not be known to all. However, Mr. Kapoor surely knew all about it. Did he make adequate and comprehensive disclosures to the Tata Steel Board ?

Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 states, amongst others, that an Independent Director shall uphold ethical standards of integrity and probity, refrain from taking any action that would lead to loss of his independence, must immediately inform the Board where circumstances arise which would make him lose his independence and assist the company in implementing best corporate governance practices. How has Mr. Deepak Kapoor fared on these parameters is best left to be adjudged by the public and the Regulators.

The intention of the law makers and the spirit of the law is further reinforced in the Rules under the Act for the rotation of Auditors. The said rules clearly state that “same network” includes the firms operating or functioning hitherto or in future under the same brand name, trade name or common control.

It is abundantly clear from the above that Mr. Deepak Kapoor was ineligible for appointment as the Independent Director of Tata Steel.

Tata Steel’s Chairman, Mr. N Chandrasekaran, while defending Kapoor’s appointment, was quoted by the media saying that Kapoor will not be inducted into the audit committee till the cooling period is over. Was Mr. Chandrasekaran not briefed properly that the embargo on the appointment of Deepak Kapoor extended to the past 3 years and not even a year had expired !

Corporate governance is going beyond the letter and mandate of the law. Adherence to best practices should not only be claimed but be demonstrated. Did the venerable house of TATAs violate the letter and the spirit of the law on two counts ? Are these the standards of Corporate Governance that we can be proud of ? Will this not set a bad and dangerous precedent to the detriment of public interest ? Will SEBI ensure immediate remedial action ? Will we ever get the answers. But one thing is clear. Public some janti hai !"

Why Our Ancient Ancestors Slept Less Than Us But Had More Energy Than We Do,"The presence constant light emanating from artificial sources such as our light bulbs and the fully lit screens of our smartphones often get blamed for the discrepancies in our sleep patterns. Although, there is truth in that we should be holding our ancestors more accountable for feeling sleepy at odd hours or not feeling 'refreshed' after a full nights sleep says a recent study.

maeemdia.com

You’d think our ancient ancestors got at least eight hours of solid sleep in a cave, right? Well, it turns out our ancestors had to take regular short bouts of naps during the day and stay up for short periods during the night to keep a look out for predators and other rival groups of humans.

The study published in the Proceedings of the Royals Society B indicates that their sleeping pattern ensures that one or some people remained awake while the others slept; making sure the person asleep (the more vulnerable to attack) is being looked out for.

keywordsuggest.org

The researchers from the University of Toronto studied the sleep patterns of the Hadza People of the Tanzania who still live the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that originated thousands of years ago.

After monitoring their sleep patterns over 20 days and nights they found that there were only 18 minutes when all 33 tribe members were asleep at the same time. There were at least eight people on an average that remain awake through the night at a given time.

kuchnia.wp

The researchers also stated the younger Hadza lot were termed as ‘owls’ since they stayed up late during their procreation years and the grandparents were referred to as ‘larks’ because they woke up early and sleep poorly.

“Researchers have theorized that one of the reasons grandparents live so long past their reproductive years is that their function is to take care of grandchildren,” says David Samson, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Toronto Mississauga. “Our hypothesis is that their lark behaviour and shorter sleep times serve a function: the elders serve as sentinels at the times of day when others are sleeping.

Infosys’s driverless golf cart versus Google’s autonomous vehicles: How can India become a global technology innovation hotspot?,"On July 14, 2017, Infosys unveiled its driverless golf cart designed and built by its engineering service team at its Mysuru campus. In contrast, by June 2016, eight years since its inception, Google’s fleet of autonomous vehicles had been driven for 28 lakh kilometers. In 2015, Google completed its first driverless ride on public roads, giving ride to a sole blind man in Austin, Texas (Wikipedia). Take another case. In April 2016, Infosys unveiled its Artificial Intelligence platform MANA. However, the first major demonstration of a similar SAP product HANA was in 2008. Can Infosys ever match up to Google’s autonomous vehicles given that it started 8 years too late? Or, can it ever beat SAP in launching a new product? In fact, breakthrough technology innovation is consistently taking place, for example, hyperloop transport, 100 MW lithium ion battery for solar PV storage, magnetically levitated trains running at over 600 km/h, wireless car battery charging, hot solar cells, practical quantum computers, paralysis reversal implants; the list goes on and on. India is far removed from the global technology innovation ecosphere. Even China is far ahead of India in technology development in manifold spheres such as advanced biometric techniques, high speed trains, military hardware, and even the traditional steel and aluminium plants. If Infosys, a progressive, cash-rich company, with enormous global exposure cannot anticipate technology direction and plays the catch-up game in product development, it is time for serious introspection about the vision and methodology of our research and development (R&D). Thus, the big question: How do we make India a global technology innovation hotspot?

Lack of technology vision has been a major impediment in Indian product development. Take the case of information technology (IT). By the late 1990s, it was abundantly clear that IT-integrated hardware would be an essential part of our life, be it communication devices, transportation, consumer appliances, shopping, and entertainment. Thus, transition from manual to automatic transmission to cruise control to driver-less vehicles (DLVs) was a natural progression. Cloud computing was expected to be a natural corollary of the internet era but you will not find Infosys/TCS/Wipro ranked among the ten best global companies. Artificial intelligence is expected to run devices and businesses more efficiently, but here too we arrived late to the party. Similarly, clean technologies and renewable energy should have been a priority area for the manufacturing industry much earlier.

We need industry leaders with the courage to take a leap of faith like Elon Musk who came up with the audaciously ambitious concept of hyperloop transport, which successfully completed its first full-scale test in May. India could have had its Elon Musk moment with driverless cars? The sensors used in navigating a DLV through traffic such as LiDAR, camera, radar, actuators were available before 2008. We had the expertise to integrate the data from sensors into a software, which would then control the motion of the DLV based on the traffic around it. Clearly a company such as TCS/Infosys could have developed a proof of concept DLV before Google. So what if the DLV was expensive and looked clunky, at least TCS/Infosys would have enough lead time to refine the DLV technology and challenge the hegemony of Google. Similarly, Mukesh Ambani has the resources to conceive and implement out-of-the-world ideas such as the space tourism capsule by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos or develop innovative solar energy and carbon capture and sequestration technologies like ExxonMobil. Unfortunately, Reliance Industries Ltd has no major technology innovation on offer, Reliance Jio being only a business model disruptor.

Emphasis on value added products and reverse engineering are two ways of countering entrenched global companies. Low costs are simply not enough as the generics-centered Indian pharmaceutical is finding out. An example in the change in mind-set is from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, which “rather than simply copy Glaxo’s migraine medication Imitrex, tweaked the formula to make it act faster at smaller doses (www.livemint.com).” The Indian steel industry is also shifting its focus towards special steels for high speed trains, nuclear and automobile industries. In many such cases, strategic foreign collaboration is required. And, this is where reverse engineering comes in. Learning the intricacies of the production process of and then leveraging this knowledge for developing innovative new products is the way forward, as China has done so successfully over the years.

Successful commercialization of new products requires an integrated approach. That is, a new product must be backed by appropriate infrastructural — software and hardware — support. Despite the concern for environment, electric cars will never be a success unless it is backed by facilities for superfast battery charging or charging on the go, as in wireless charging.

Finally, there must be a fundamental shift in our approach towards research and product development. Is it worth expending significant R&D in non-strategic products where the chances of being a global leader are remote? Take the example of automobile engines. Taxi owners will tell you that a Toyota Etios can run for more than 300,000 km without any major tinkering with the engine. The corresponding number for a Tata Indigo is about 100,000 km. Consequently, why should we even bother about significant R&D in automobile engines especially when such technologies can be readily bought off-the-shelf. Instead, we should follow a composite approach for R&D: (i) value-addition in existing products/technologies to increase energy efficiency and lower costs and (ii) focus firmly on technologies of tomorrow such as batteries, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and 3-D printing."

California Bill Wants To Delay School Start Time So Teens Can Catch Up On Some Sleep,"Getting groggy teens to get ready for school is always a huge task for parents. But people in California needn't fret anymore, thanks to California’s Senate Education Committee that has passed a bill to ensure opening hours not be earlier than 8:30 am for middle and high school students.

Picture for representation/Reuters

According to local media reports, the Senate Bill 328 would require all middle and high schools across to have their start times be no later than 8:30 am. The bill author, State Senator Anthony Portantino (D-La Cañada Flintridge), said his bill was based on research conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

The bill was in the Assembly Education Committee on July 12. It now awaits a hearing in the Assembly Appropriations Committee in late August or early September.

According to a study conducted by Centers for Disease Control, among 39,700 public middle, high, and combined schools in US have an average start time of 8:00 am.

Picture for representation /Twitter

The report states that adolescents who do not get enough sleep are more likely to be overweight, to engage in daily physical activity, suffer from depressive symptoms and engage in unhealthy risk behaviors such as drinking, smoking tobacco, and drug abuse.

Anthony Portantino's bill ensures that 3 million students in California’s public middle and high schools can go to school at times that gives them enough sleep time, eat healthy and then head to school.

The study suggests that when high schools start at 8:30 am or later, attendance rates and graduation rates improve."

Will Amazon Prime Video and Netflix be the upholders of free speech,"Amazon Prime Video and Netflix have been racking up a number of deals of late. The online streaming rights for Padmavati starring Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have been sold to Amazon Prime Video for a rumored Rs 20-25 crore. Padmavati is rumored to have been made at a cost of Rs 180 crores by the director of the film Sanjay Leela Bhansali.

Is this going to be the new norm for film makers? It could well be. Salman Khan has offered Amazon Prime the rights to stream his movies even before their television premiere. Yash Raj films, T-Series and many others have been reported to have signed similar deals.

With more than 2000 screens across India, multiplexes are an attractive option. USA with more than 40,000 screens has over 125 screens per million of population. India has a measly six screens per million people. Multiplexes may not de-risk the creative expression.

Getting the movie to the right number of screens is not a task for the faint hearted director. Even if the movie is slated to be shown for a week at a multiplex, the fate of the movie is usually decided over the weekend. If there is a blockbuster movie released in the same week, the audience will go to watch the bigger draw. Hence a movie made with a smaller budget does not have the staying power to survive another week at the multiplex.

During the shooting of Padmavati, the director was assaulted by the workers of Rajput Karni Sena who also vandalised the sets of the film. The vandals were peeved by what they claimed was the “distortion of historical facts”. They were offended by the manner in which Alauddin Khilji was shown to be obsessed with Padmavati’s beauty. It is easy to expect that multiplex owners will hesitate to screen Padmavati lest the vandals destroy the movie theatre after watching the movie. You never know who will be offended.

This may mean that a film maker who decides to make a movie that may not be the usual song and dance kitsch that is the standard fare of Bollywood is at risk. Of course Padmavati is not the first movie that has courted controversy. Songs have had to be dropped or have their lyrics modified to appease a group that has been offended. Anyone can take a film or an artiste to court or beat them into silence. Comedians have been told that their brand of humor is offensive and have been hauled up before courts. Artists have been threatened because their depiction was not acceptable.

For the film makers, writers, lyricists and comedians, the streaming giants may offer a safe haven where opinions that are not palatable to the majority can be expressed. The stand-up comedians can do their routine without fear of a backlash other than the market forces. If viewers do not watch the shows or rate it poorly, the artistes will be taken off the air or at the very least not invited back. Free speech that challenges our worldview may thrive in the fringes while the mainstream cinema continues to dole out what is safe but bland. That may be another form of the digital divide."
"Where we top: Hope, optimism: And where both fail there’s a sense of resigned acceptance, a return to Karma","Mr India and Mrs Bharat go before a judge. After hearing Mr India’s testimony, the judge says, “It seems you are right.” But after Mrs Bharat presents her case, the judge says, “It seems you are right too.” The court steno chronicling the case pipes up, “Judge, how can both be right?” Judge: “Hmmm…you are right too.”

India speaks in many voices. India is also seen from many angles through many prisms and many eyes, making it hard to assess objectively. Famously it is said, “Whatever you can rightly say about India, the opposite is also true.”

Many see India at 70 as a stupendous success. The very survival of a young nation born of an old civilisation, derided by the racist-imperialist Winston Churchill as “a geographical term… no more a united nation than the Equator,” is accomplishment enough for most Indians and Indophiles. Some see India as being more united than, er, the United Kingdom. That it has stuck steadfastly to its founding ideals – and civilisational underpinnings – and has thrived as a plural democracy in the face of many odds, occasional aberration aside, is cause for celebration. The rest is bonus.

Others see abject failure. A nation of immense promise at its birth, helmed by progressive visionaries, has muddled along in fits and starts, wracked by internecine warfare involving regions, religion, caste, and class. From “functioning anarchy” it appears to have descended into anarchic functioning; a small affluent society has no eyes or ears for the large effluent society. A country that has landed spacecraft on Moon and Mars cannot overcome its dismal infant mortality rates, its abysmal social practices, its infantile politics.

For these among other reasons, India is alternately admired and scorned, venerated and derided outside India.

Hot Borders: At a moment when its borders are overheated, it is evident that one of India’s biggest failures in the global and regional domain has been its inability to arrive at settled boundaries with contentious neighbours – two in particular. Of course, it takes two to tango. No country can make peace – or concessions – unilaterally. But for a country of its size (and self-importance) India has been singularly lacking in sustained energy and focus to resolve an issue that would have allowed it to adequately parlay its influence beyond its neighbourhood.

The result has been a country hamstrung in its attempted tryst with destiny, locked instead in seemingly petty neighbourhood squabbles. Compared to the immense skill with which it navigated the Cold War, where it managed not to antagonise or aggravate the United States excessively despite its non-aligned alignment with the former Soviet Union, New Delhi’s regional policy has been lackadaisical – an approach bordering more on hope (that somehow the problems will disappear) than on purposeful urgency.

Second Failure: Some half century later, its two main borders still unsettled, India appears to have ceded its natural sphere of influence stretching from the Gulf and Africa to southeast Asia, to China. Our history textbooks are heavily centred on north to northwest India, all but ignoring peninsular ties around the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal. Our singular obsession with Pakistan and its provocations has simply allowed China to get around us and get a lock on many countries where India has deeper roots.

Our biggest fiascos though have been domestic; our global slip-ups pale in comparison to the self-injury we have brought on ourselves with our inability to address basic issues relating to healthcare and sanitation, education and employment, infrastructure and development, all areas that countries (such as South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia) with even lower metrics than India at the cusp of its Independence have improved dramatically to race ahead in the global economic sweepstakes. We are still playing catch-up.

There is in India a tendency to take comfort in small, sectoral successes: the fact that life expectancy and literacy have improved significantly since Independence; that agricultural production has increased so much that we are self-sufficient in foodgrains; that we have had signal successes in our nuclear and space programmes; that we are finally getting a decent communications and highway network. There is both self-gratification and self-glorification over all these admirable feats.

But as we are reminded every single day, our success is spotty and random. Our increased (low quality) life expectancy is weighted down by our grim infant mortality metrics, lower than that of sub-Saharan Africa, reflected in the unspeakable tragedy in Gorakhpur. With some of most fecund and arable lands and riverine systems in the world, we remain a low-yield agricultural society despite becoming self-sufficient in food, our messy market mechanisms making a meal of farm incomes. Our annual roadkill stats – more than 150,000 lives lost – would qualify as a genocide. Our cities and towns speak for themselves – grim, dirty, and chaotic – with not one qualifying to be worthy of a Top Ten tourist destination.

Where we top: Hope, optimism, and where both fail, a sense of resigned acceptance. Karma.

So how and what do we score for India given its dodgy record both on the domestic and global front? A 30/100 or a 70/100? A 100/100 we certainly aren’t (unless you are one of those delusional hyperpatriots working up a lather on social media), so a 50/100? It’s your call.

Purely subjectively, i’d go with 35/100 (pass marks in Indian systems), with the reasonable prospects of nailing a first class, if not a distinction, if we act with urgency and purpose in the thirty years to our centennial. Happy Independence Day."

"Tech Firms With Indian CEOs, Founders Are Creating Record Number Of Jobs For Americans In US","Silicon Valley emerged as a hotspot for Indian software graduates in the 1970-80s. Ever since, they have broken the glass ceiling for immigrants, pushed the boundaries of technological innovation and many have secured highly visible positions of power.

From the likes of Vinod Khosla cofounding Sun Microsystems, to Sabeer Bhatia establishing Hotmail, to the new crop of leaders, including Sundar Pichai becoming the CEO of Google, Satya Nadella becoming the CEO of Microsoft, and most recently Jyoti Bansal selling his app performance management company App Dynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion, a long list of success stories have emerged over the years.

AFP

“I was in the US on an H-1B visa and I had to wait many years to get my Green Card before I could start a company of my own. If you already have an established start up in India, moving to Silicon Valley to establish a presence is a bit easier,” said Jyoti Bansal, founder of AppDynamics to ET.

Ajmer-born Bansal moved to US with dreams of setting up his own venture in 2000, but it took him seven years of working for other startups before he got the employment authorisation document that allowed him to launch his own company.

“The first challenge for Indian-origin founders is to overcome visa and immigration issues before they can start a business in Silicon Valley. And the most important ingredient missing is the lack of experience selling and marketing in US and international markets, but that will come over time,” Bansal said.

In 2016, according to the US Census Bureau, Indians stood out as the richest, as well as the most educated ethnic group in the country. Most recently, in an environment that’s becoming increasingly hostile, MadeByImmigrants was formed in association with the Amercian Civil Liberties Union.

This comes as US president Donald Trump has made his views clear on immigrants taking away local jobs. The project said immigrants had set up over 65 companies, creating over 500,000 jobs in US, with Indian entrepreneurs and those at a leadership level contributing close to 35 percent to 40 percent.

“At Google alone, 40 percent of the engineers are Indians, it’s common for quite a few of them to set out and start ventures on their own. Even at the leadership level there are Indians heading various verticals,” a senior executive at Google told ET at the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, California.

According to the Migration Policy Institute, there were 89,000 Indians living in Silicon Valley in 2015, with most involved in the tech industry. Newer enterprise tech Indian startups Postman, Nutanix and Helpshift had to overcome a series of challenges ranging from insurance, office space, making local recruitments to adapting to cultural changes.

“Setting up shop in a new country can be complicated. Everything is a bit different--banks, insurance, ways of doing business. We found our investors, Nexus Venture Partners, who have a base in Silicon Valley, to be super helpful on recruitments, finding an office, business advice on day to day challenges,” said Abhinav Asthana, cofounder of Postman.

According to Abinash Tripathy, founder of Helpshift, the top two issues Indians face are adaptation to the culture and lack of a local network. “We are just starting to see the first generation of product startups emerge from India, which is very exciting,” said Tripathy.

“The process of the ecosystem maturing to the point where we will create globally competitive companies is a multi-decade process that has just started,” he said.

Bonds Of Friendship: Taipei Universiade is Taiwan’s red carpet for the world,"From August 19 to 30, Taiwan’s capital Taipei will host more than 7,700 student athletes from 153 countries for the 2017 Summer Universiade. The latter is the premier international multi-sport event for University athletes who consider it to be a stepping stone to participation in the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and the Olympics. The Taipei Universiade will see the young athletes vie for laurels in 21 sports at 38 different venues. In fact, this Universiade will be the largest international sporting event in Taiwan – a big feat for this island nation of 23 million people.

But what’s even more important for Taiwan is that the Universiade is an opportunity for it to broaden its international engagements and build ties of friendship. As is well known, Taiwan has official diplomatic ties with a handful of small countries. Saddled by the historical baggage of the Chinese civil war that forced the Kuomintang to flee to Taiwan and transplant the Republic of China there, the Taiwanese today continue to navigate complicated narratives of identity and state. Add to this the fact that an overwhelming majority of countries in the world recognise only one China, which being the People’s Republic of China, and it’s easy to see why Taiwan has had to find creative ways to keep its diplomatic and strategic depth intact.

And one of the ways in which Taiwan has done that – and continues to do so – is to become a giver. It has tried its best to share its successes with the rest of the world, be it through outbound investments, manufacturing and research collaboration, or medical aid and technical assistance. Of course, all of this hasn’t been easy with China constantly pressuring Taiwan to toe its line of eventual re-unification. However, the reality is that Taiwan today is very different from China. The former has evolved into a robust multi-party democracy, while the latter has become a Communist powerhouse. Plus, the new generation in Taiwan has no real attachment with China. And having grown up in a free-thinking, democratic atmosphere, it is hard to see Taiwanese youth even consider re-unification with the mainland.

Nonetheless, Taiwan’s challenges remain as it continues to be constrained from taking part in the comity of nations as a normal country. And it’s here that Taiwan’s well-wishers need to help it. After all, Taiwan is a unique success story – a manufacturing dynamo, a beacon of democracy and a leader in cutting-edge innovation and research – that needs to be nurtured further. All Taiwan asks for is friendship and mutually beneficial partnerships. It is focussed on building long-lasting relationships rather than cost-benefit economic activities that usually determine foreign policy. Taiwan is thinking about everyone’s future and solutions to global challenges – it simply can’t afford to be selfish.

This is precisely why the Taipei Universiade is so important for Taiwan. By welcoming young people from across the world to Taiwanese shores, Taiwan wants to build ever-lasting friendships. Indian athletes too will be participating at this Universiade. It is hoped that they, along with athletes from other nations, will become bridges for their respective countries to Taiwan – the heart of Asia."
Here’s Why That Friendly Smiley You Use In Your Email Maybe Doing You More Harm Than Good,"Think you’re being nice or friendly by adding a smiley to the end or between your emails? Software developers may agree with you and give the full go ahead by equipping you with a barrage of conversational tools, but a recent study claims you may want to consider stopping using smileys or similar emoticons in formal emails.

wokv.com

A recent study, however, called “The Dark Side of a Smiley” claims that smiley face may come across as rather benign and might be causing more harm than a good.

Using a smiley face emoji or similar emoticons in work-related emails may not create a positive impression and could actually portray low competence, reveals the study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science.

thebalance.com

""Our findings provide first-time evidence that, contrary to actual smiles, smileys do not increase perceptions of warmth and actually decrease perceptions of competence. In formal business emails, a smiley is not a smile,"" said Ella Glikson, a post doctorate fellow at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) in Israel.

Researchers conducted a series of experiments with a total of 549 participants from 29 different countries.

In one experiment, participants were asked to read a work-related e-mail from an unknown person and then evaluate both the competence and warmth of that person.

All the participants received similar messages. Some included smileys while others did not.

Researchers found that in contrast to face-to-face smiles, which increase both competence and warmth, the smileys in an email had no effect on the perception of warmth, and in fact had a negative effect on the perception of competence.

""The study also found that when the participants were asked to respond to emails on formal matters, their answers were more detailed and they included more content-related information when the e-mail did not include a smiley,"" Glikson said.

""We found that the perceptions of low competence if a smiley is included in turn undermined information sharing,"" she said.

In another experiment, the use of a smiley was compared to a smiling or neutral photograph. The findings show that in the case of a photograph, a smiling sender was perceived as more competent and friendly than a neutral one.

However, when an e-mail on formal work-related matters included a smiley, the sender was perceived as less competent. The smiley did not influence the evaluation of the sender's friendliness, researchers said.

The team also found that when the gender of the e-mail writer was unknown, recipients were more likely to assume that a woman sent the email if it included a smiley.

However, this attribution did not influence the evaluation of competence or friendliness.

""People tend to assume that a smiley is a virtual smile, but the findings show that in the case of the workplace, at least as far as initial 'encounters' are concerned, this is incorrect,"" Glikson said.

""For now, at least, a smiley can only replace a smile when you already know the other person. In initial interactions, it is better to avoid using smileys, regardless of age or gender,"" she added.

Ashwin set to play County cricket for Worcestershire,"COUNTY FOR ASHWIN

Ashwin set to play County cricket for Worcestershire

""It is a blessing in disguise for both Pujara and Ashwin because we will have a fully fledged tour of five Tests in England next year"" - MSK Prasad © Getty

Ravichandran Ashwin, the spearhead of the Indian attack, is set to play for the Division 2 County side Worcestershire for the rest of the Championship season. He is expected to make his County debut against Gloucestershire at New Road in Division Two on August 28. Australia fast bowler John Hastings, who represents Worcestershire in the County circuit, was ruled out of the remainder of the season with a foot injury, and Ashwin slots in as a replacement for him.

""Ravi is a fantastic international cricketer who is currently in terrific form with his game,"" Steve Rhodes, the County's Director of Cricket, said.

""He is ranked in the top three as a bowler in Test cricket, is a wonderful all-rounder who can bat six and scores hundreds in Test cricket.

""It is unlucky for John Hastings with his injury but Ravi is a wonderful cricketer for us to have at a crucial point in our season.

""It is a really important last few games for the club and to have someone of his ilk and class and quality is a huge boost for the Club. The good thing about Ravi is he has been successful on all types of pitches in all sorts of different continents. He is a class bowler who will bowl well here,"" Rhodes added.

The off-spinner, with 292 Test wickets to his name, hasn't yet played domestic cricket in England. However, the ace spinner has now received the green signal from the board to represent Worcestershire in County cricket after the selectors decided to rest him for the ODIs against Sri Lanka.

Worcestershire still have four Division 2 matches left during the County season. So the veteran all-rounder could miss out on the upcoming ODI series against Australia scheduled to start on September 17 as he looks to acclimatise to the English conditions ahead of the Test series against England next year.

Meanwhile, Chesteshwar Pujara is also set to return to the Second Division County side, Nottinghamshire. The middle-order batsman has already scored 232 runs at an average of 44.60 for the County side this season. After playing the first half of the season, he was called up for national duty for the just-concluded Test series against Sri Lanka.

Both Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire are eyeing a promotion to Division One. Nottinghamshire have 184 points from 10 matches and are placed at the top of the table. On the other hand, Worcestershire have slotted in at second position with 149 points. Worcestershire last played in Division One in 2015 when they were relegated after ending the season as the bottom-placed team with 151 points.

""It is a blessing in disguise for both of them because we will have a fully fledged tour of five Tests in England next year,"" MSK Prasad, the chairman of selectors said.

""It is always good to play and get that first hand feel of the conditions. From a selection point of view they have been rested first and then they have been given consent by the BCCI to go and play county cricket,"" he added.

Ashwin, in all likelihood, will play against his Indian team-mate, Pujara, when the Midlands County take on Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on September 5. Worcestershire are also slated to play against Leicestershire and Durham.

Nawab of Pataudi sr. (33 matches), Kapil Dev and Zaheer Khan (16 matches) are some of the famous Indian cricketers who have played for Worcestershire. Zaheer, the wily seamer, had a successful time at Worcestershire, bagging 78 first-class wickets for the County.

There were also reports that experienced pacer Ishant Sharma too was to ply his trade in England, turning out for Warwickshire. The fast bowler, however, clarified on Twitter that he hasn't penned a contract with any County side. Warwickshire also have Jeetan Patel as their foreign player and were unlikely to sign up Ishant.

Contrary to the news rounds through various sites, have not signed Warwickshire or any other county. — Ishant Sharma (@ImIshant) August 14, 2017

Going on record: CCTV in courts will significantly enhance judicial transparency,"In a welcome move, the Supreme Court has favoured the installation of CCTV cameras in all courts to facilitate audio-video recordings of court proceedings. This is certain to boost transparency within our courts which are anyway saddled with a huge backlog of cases. It’s an unfortunate reality that judicial proceedings in this country, especially in lower courts, suffer inordinate delays due to non-adherence to prescribed procedures. Repeated adjournments make getting justice a laborious and expensive endeavour. Such delays and backlog only undermine people’s faith in the judiciary. True, we need more courts and judges. But this by itself won’t make the wheels of justice turn faster.

Adequate attention needs to be given to procedural propriety and reforms. And it’s here that installing CCTV cameras in courts makes sense. In fact, the apex court in March had directed all high courts to ensure video recording of lower court proceedings in two districts of every state and Union territory. Scaling this up to facilitate audio-video recordings in all courts across the country will be natural progression. This will keep a check on everyone within courtroom including judges, advocates and police, and encourage responsible behaviour on all sides. Additionally, it will reduce unequal treatment meted out to different parties, threats by any person to witnesses and absence of lawyers at important stages of the proceedings.

The issue of privacy of judges doesn’t cut ice here. It’s the law of the land that all court proceedings are to be held in open court. Besides, as the top court itself has observed, constitutional courts in other countries have audio-video recordings and US Supreme Court proceedings are even available on YouTube. The apex court isn’t going there, it has stipulated that such recordings won’t be made available under RTI. Nonetheless, the recordings will mark a significant jump in judicial transparency."

Space program and defense program

Despite having almost nil self-reliance on defense technology and space technology, today we are one of the most advance nations in this field. Indians have been able to develop one of the most envious space programs in the world started in the year 1969 after their independence .To this day, we launched various space programs including Lunar and Mars mission, and on way to commercially launch satellites of developed nations at very low cost, all thanks to Indian Space Research Organization."
Nobody should be forced to sing Vande Mataram,"Among the worst examples of judicial overreach was last week’s declaration by the Madras High Court that the singing of Vande Mataram should be made compulsory in schools, colleges and both government and private offices, including, presumably, The Times of India. Let me stick my neck out and say I refuse to be coerced in this fashion. I have sung Vande Mataram on sundry social occasions, but am outraged by the decree that I must do so in my office to prove my patriotism. My own view of patriotism requires me to oppose this, and to urge others to do the same. The Supreme Court needs to nullify this judgment speedily.

The case before the high court was not about making the singing of any song mandatory. A government job applicant had, in his entrance exam, said in reply to a question that Vande Mataram was written in Bengali. The examiner said no, this was a Sanskrit song. The honourable court should have limited its verdict to this issue.

What certainly falls within judicial turf is the Constitutional freedom of speech. This must include the freedom of singing, as opposed to coerced singing. The Supreme Court has clarified that even though it has decreed that the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, must be played in cinema theatres, the audience is not obliged to sing along. There is no reason to make singing mandatory for any other song.

If a BJP state or central government passes a law obliging all citizens to sing Vande Mataram, that can be challenged as unconstitutional. Only at that stage should the courts come into the picture. I would expect them to stand up for Constitutional freedoms.

The once-sharp line between judicial and executive authority has long become a grey area. In many cases, the government has so violated its own duties, has been so corrupt and callous, that the public interest has been served by judicial intrusion into areas that in other democracies would be viewed as executive territory. Swaminomics has in the past defended judicial activism in cases of gross government complicity in illegalities (such as unauthorised iron ore mining). But mandating the singing of Vande Mataram is certainly not such a case.

The Madras High Court justifies mandatory singing by saying the song was among those sung during the independence movement. So what? Did every community and every freedom fighter sing it? No. The song traces its ancestry to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s book, Anandamath, about a Hindu revolt against Muslim rulers. Was the song sung by millions of Muslims who participated in the independence movement? Absolutely not. Was it sung by Bhimrao Ambedkar and all Dalits? Or by Master Tara Singh and all his Sikh followers? No, and that is no measure at all of their patriotism.

When India gained independence, Vande Mataram was among the songs considered for the status of national anthem. But it was offensive to a large section of Muslims, and hence deemed inappropriate. National anthems and other patriotic songs should be instruments to unify citizens, not divide them (as Vande Mataram does). Were all the great leaders of the independence movement, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, unpatriotic in rejecting Vande Mataram as the national anthem, and in opting against its singing in schools and offices? Did they not have the highest interests of the nation in their minds? But of course. How, then, is it the job of any court to overrule them on what constitutes patriotism?

Many other songs were associated with the independence movement, including Subhash Chandra Bose’s Dilli Chalo Re, which was possibly sung more widely than Vande Mataram. The same is true of Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Gandhiji’s hymn for religious harmony and unity. Also sung regularly at Gandhiji’s prayer meetings was Abide With Me. His patriotism was inclusive enough to savour a hymn of the British conquerors. Because of this, Abide With Me is played every year by the armed forces band at the super-patriotic Beating Retreat ceremony after Republic Day in New Delhi. Vande Mataram does not figure.

It may be desirable to popularise all the songs associated with the independence movement. But why make their singing mandatory? Gandhiji would have said no. He thought ahimsa required him to persuade others, not force them, to do the right thing. The courts should heed his approach."

Another episode, the sixth one, has also been leaked, and what’s even more shocking is that it was “by mistake” aired on HBO Spain for one hour. Yes, that happened, and we are wondering what’s going wrong, too. The channel wanted to air episode 6, but by mistake, it aired the seventh one entirely (71-minute long episode.)

Fans shared the video clips speculating how the episode must have leaked. Reportedly, one of the Instagram users live-streamed the entire episode.

McDonald’s allowed the tussle with JV partner to fester and deteriorate further,"By Ragvinder Singh Rekhi

“Illegal, unlawful, unjust and malicious.” A judge of the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) used these words recently to describe McDonald’s, a company where I worked for 20 years, where everyone considered themselves members of a McFamily with ketchup in their veins. What a remarkable denouement to a sorry saga.

A few weeks earlier, McDonald’s had shut down 43 of its restaurants in Delhi. The McDonald’s name, usually linked to accolades, was now being excoriated by a judge. How did this come to pass? Why did it even get to such a stage? Surely, a world-renowned company like McDonald’s would have avoided letting a matter fester and deteriorate to such depths.

The dispute between McDonald’s and its 50:50 joint venture partner for North and East India is public knowledge. Given the NCLT ruling, we now know the facts. But what is not clear is why.

In 2013, at a meeting of the board of directors of Connaught Plaza Restaurants (the JV company for North & East India), the directors representing McDonald’s ousted the Indian JV partner as managing director. One would have thought McDonald’s would have wielded ironclad power to do so. It turns out, it did not. Not even close; the JV contract clearly assigns the position of MD to the Indian partner, as pointed out by the NCLT. But, did McDonald’s have a plan?

Is McDonald’s obliged to stick with a JV partner even if it was a bad choice? Of course not. Malfeasance on the part of the partner would be justification enough to break the partnership. McDonald’s accused the partner of financial irregularity based upon misrepresentation of an event that took place over five years prior to that ill-fated board meeting. But it had re-elected him MD multiple years after the alleged irregularity, even praising his good performance! The NCLT judgement demolishes the malfeasance argument.

It appears customers, suppliers and employees in India have been abandoned by the senior management in McDonald’s HQ in USA. What were they thinking would happen when you take a 50:50 JV, each side represented by two directors, oust the managing director and then leave the day-to-day management headless and on auto-pilot for nearly four years? Is it possible that the severe consequences of this were considered and deemed acceptable? Possible, but unlikely.

McDonald’s operates in more than a 100 countries. From my years in the company, I know McDonald’s almost always preferred to resolve these sort of problems long before they got to the point of litigation. So, is it possible that the top management was not aware? Given the enormous distance in culture and geography between India and USA, it is possible.

But, then again, McDonald’s successfully operates in so many different cultures and geographies that this was likely not an act of omission or miscommunication. Of commission then? Horrors!

Iknow of no instance in my 20 years at McDonald’s, working in many different parts of the world, where the interest and well being of the customers and employees was not paramount. And, yet, here we are, with 43 restaurants shut down in the capital of India because their health licence had expired; with no leadership — McDonald’s-nominated directors have not come to India for several years. How does one entrust the day-today management of a retail, customerfacing business to an absentee board?

Is it possible that McDonald’s actually thought this would work? Clearly McDonald’s wants the partner out of the JV. To buy him out is its absolute right. But to go about it in the manner it has, destroying lives, damaging reputations and squandering the colossal resources that were expended in creating the business and brand reputation? To force down the value of the JV partner’s stake? That is not the right way.

I cannot fathom how McDonald’s top management could have approved such a course of action. Is it possible then that this whole saga was the handiwork of someone in upper mid-management who let hubris overcome better judgement, to the point of wanting to drive out the local JV partner? Or, in this case, for a pittance? Does one cut off one’s nose to spite one’s face? Go figure!

SL name ODI squad; skipper Tharanga calls for support

Upul Tharanga urged the country to rally behind the team while stating that every team in each sport goes through a rough phase. © AFP

In the aftermath of Sri Lanka's abysmal 3-0 Test series loss at the hands of the No. 1 ranked Test side India, ODI skipper Upul Tharanga called for the nation's support and urged the fans to rally behind the team in testing times as Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced the 15-member squad for the upcoming five-match ODI series on Tuesday (August 15).

ODI Squad: Upul Tharanga (c), Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Chamara Kapugedera, Milinda Siriwardana, Malinda Pushpakumara, Akila Dananjaya, Lakshan Sandakan, Thisara Perera, Wanindu Hasaranga, Lasith Malinga, Dushmantha Chameera, Vishwa Fernando

With Asela Gunaratne yet to recover from the thumb injury he sustained during the first Test, the selectors have recalled allrounders Thisara Perera and Milinda Siriwardana for the five-match series. While Perera was overlooked for the home series against Zimbabwe, Siriwardana's last appearance for the national side came in the limited-overs series against Bangladesh in March-April this year.

Veteran fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara, who featured in the final ODI against Zimbabwe, has been given the axe alongside Asitha Fernando and Lahiru Kumara. In their place, the selectors have included Malinda Pushpakumara, who recently made his Test debut against India and young seamer Vishwa Fernando. Both Pushpakumara and Fernando are yet to make their debut in the 50-over format.

""Every team goes through a rough patch,"" skipper Tharanga said. ""This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are.

Sri Lanka conceded 600+ totals in two of the three Tests and were asked to follow on in the last two games before succumbing to innings defeats. While the island nation weren't expected to topple the No. 1 ranked side during the series, the manner of defeat came across as rather baffling as their side kept slipping to newer depths every time. With the five-match ODI series and a lone T20I coming up, the skipper noted that every team had its share of lows and goes through a phase of transition before coming back on top.

""Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for a good 18 years - don't forget this now when we are going through a rough patch. Obviously there are some things we can't openly discuss due to strategic reasons but there are certain areas behind the scenes that need to fall into place for us. These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes - however it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith.""

The skipper also reposed faith in the limited-overs outfit and felt that they are well equipped to fare better against their opponents in the 50-over format of the game. ""Sri Lanka have always been stronger in our white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India. We have the talent, we have the skill. We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too.

""The support of our fans plays a big role in the morale of the team. We play for our country and our goal is to bring pride to our family of 20 million in this nation - so your support is something that matters greatly to us.

""Yesterday despite the defeat, we saw spectators cheering us and applauding us - this is what we need. It inspires us to fight harder too - so as the captain of the ODI & T20 teams, I want to appeal to each every one of you,"" concluded Tharanga.

Zubair Ahmed, the Quetta Bears batsman, succumbed to the nasty blow he sustained after being hit on the head by a bouncer. The incident occurred during a club match at Mardan District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, on Monday (August 14). Ahmed, who has played four games for Quetta, reportedly didn't have his helmet on when he was struck on the head.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) took to Twitter to convey their condolence and also urged every cricketer to wear the protective gear at all times while at the crease.

Tragic death of Zubair Ahmed is another reminder that safety gear i.e. helmet must be worn at all times. Our sympathies with Zubair's family pic.twitter.com/ZNmWDYaT5w — PCB Official (@TheRealPCB) August 16, 2017

Earlier in the week, Australia opener, David Warner, was struck on the neck during a three-day intra-squad game against a Steve Smith-led unit. The southpaw Warner was reportedly jolted by the hit to his neck, but was quickly back on his feet. Smith checked on his national-side deputy before the latter walked off the field. Warner had been dismissed for four in the first innings and had batted 14 balls in the second, before missing his attempted hook shot off Josh Hazlewood and getting hit - cutting short his bid to get some game time before he gets on the flight to Bangladesh. Later, the Australian think-tank decided to rest him on the final day of the practice game as a precautionary measure.

The world of cricket came to a standstill following the untimely demise of Australia cricketer Phil Hughes, who failed to recover from the head injury copped in a Sheffield Shield match between South Australia and New South Wales in November, 2014. Ever since, calls for enhanced protective gear, and safety at all times, have increased.

‘You need to develop relationships across bureaucracy and with private sector to be trusted and effective in India’,"Rakesh Mohan, Distinguished Fellow at Brookings India, has been deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India and secretary in the ministry of finance. He is the editor of ‘India Transformed: 25 Years of Economic Reforms’ and spoke to Sanjiv Shankaran on the debate around expat economists in Indian policymaking, RBI’s inflation targeting regime and economic reform processes:

You believe the push for change in India’s economy came from the bureaucracy and not academia. Why?

That is a remarkable feature of our reform process. In the early 1980s there was little call for change from Indian academics, except for the prescient book by Jagdish Bhagwati and Padma Desai in the 1970s. It is interesting that much of the technocratic call for change came from within. There has been a very interesting interaction between regular IAS civil servants and long-serving economic advisers who have been lateral hires and who then served the government for 20-30 years. They then developed relationships with the rest of the bureaucracy and got trusted. Illustrious examples include IG Patel, Bimal Jalan, Manmohan Singh and Montek Ahluwalia who served many different governments.

How would you distinguish an earlier generation of technocrats hired laterally with the current generation?

They are bright, dedicated economists whether it is Kaushik Basu, Raghuram Rajan, Arvind Panagariya or Arvind Subramanian. They brought in new ideas. The issue that I would have is that it takes time for anyone to become effective in terms of getting to know the system, the issues and also all the personnel in government and outside. You need to develop relationships across bureaucracy and with the private sector as well to be trusted and to be effective.

On one hand, it is a great idea to get such people at the highest levels as advisers. But if they had come at a younger age and served the country for 25-30 years they would have been that much more effective. It seems to me that you need a combination of getting lateral hires who then work their way and contribute on a continuous basis, and others who come as senior advisers at the highest levels for temporary periods.

Didn’t the changeover to inflation targeting happen over an unusually short period in the Indian context?

Raghuram Rajan came (as RBI governor), appointed the Urjit Patel committee which recommended it, as did the FSLRC (Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Committee). The government then implemented it. It didn’t take very long. This was relatively easy to do. It was too technical a subject for public debate.

I don’t agree with inflation targeting as a monetary policy mechanism, not just in India but generally. There is one target, that is, inflation, and one instrument, the policy interest rate. It makes macroeconomics and understanding of macro economy and inflation too simplistic. It almost makes it a hydraulic system. It can also take your sight away from other things that may be happening in the economy. To my mind it also contaminates public discussion. Once there is a simple target and instrument, public discussion becomes about questions of will or won’t they [cut interest rates] as we observe in the frenzied media discussion before every monetary policy meeting now.

Was it any different in your time?

It was totally different. We were not inflation targeting. I think RBI under Governor Bimal Jalan had indeed made a significant innovation in articulating an explicit multiple indicator policy. The point is that given the way an economy works you have to look at a number of different variables at the same time, including growth and financial stability. Remember that this approach delivered low inflation from the mid-1990s till around 2008, along with high growth, financial development and financial stability.

Can economic change in India be only a gradual process?

The answer is yes and no. Look to the precursors of the 1991 reforms. There was a whole set of committees in the 1960s and 1970, particularly to do with the functioning of the licensing system, which were good at identifying problems in the functioning of the system, but they invariably ended up recommending further tightening rather than liberalising the malfunctioning system.

Also, the global backdrop of development thinking right upto the mid-1960s was to do with planning, import substitution etc. Today, when we think of examples of high growth we think of East Asia; in the 1950s it was socialist countries. We were completely, in that sense, consistent with the rest of the world.

The change in global thinking came in the late 1960s and 70s, starting with South Korea and Taiwan. We took much longer and started thinking of change only in the 1980s."
"The Ancient Greeks Built An Accurate, Eclipse-Predicting Computer More Than 2000 Years Ago!","You may think of computer as a modern invention, and indeed they are, but the concept itself is older than you can imagine. In fact, even as we’re watching the solar eclipse this month because we’ve predicted when they occur, the ancient Greeks had a computer that could do the same.

The ancient Greeks' Antikythera Mechanism

Called the Antikythera mechanism, it was discovered in 1900 when a group of sponge divers took shelter from a storm on the island of Antikythera. The divers unearthed a shipwreck approximately 2,000 years old, where an archeological expedition later uncovered the primitive computer.

The mechanism consisted of a device the size of a shoebox and covered with dials, filled with about 30 gears made of bronze. Though it was discovered in pieces, researchers eventually realised it was a computational mechanism that let the Greeks pinpoint eclipses and other astronomical phenomenon.

Instructions on the box showed that the crank could be turned to calculate the positions of the stars during future solar and lunar eclipses, allowing the user to predict at what time they would occur. Additionally, it was a sophisticated enough machine to even figure out the kind of eclipse that would occur (ie whether partial or total) to a precise degree.

It’s still unclear what the significance of eclipses were in Greek culture, though it’s believed they were omens of some sort."
How an inept finance ministry pushes up India’s food subsidy bill,"The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on 4th August tabled in parliament a compliance audit report on Food Corporation of India. One of the striking features of the report is that it shows up India’s finance ministry as an inept body. Its management of finances is poor and the consequence is that India’s subsidy bill is bigger than it should be.

FCI, which was created by legislation in 1964, is central to India’s food security programme. It handles procurement and storage of food grains. FCI’s operations are primarily funded by the food subsidy provided by finance ministry.

CAG’s report- covering the period between 2011-12 and 2015-16- shows that over time the gap between the subsidy claimed by FCI and the amount released by finance ministry has widened.

As FCI needs the money to keep its operations going, it has begun to borrow an increasing amount of money from commercial sources. The largest source of borrowing is cash credit extended to it by a consortium of banks. It also happens to be a relatively expensive source of borrowing.

The consequence of this chain of events is that FCI’s subsidy requirement keeps increasing partly on account of the interest it pays for its commercial borrowing.

CAG’s report shows that FCI paid an interest of Rs 35,701.81 crore over five years to make up for the shortfall of subsidy.

This, among other factors, makes FCI’s operations more expensive than it should be. All of this feeds into the food subsidy bill.

“The main reason for indebtedness of FCI was delayed/insufficient release of subsidy by ministry,” says the CAG report.

The next time finance ministers and ministry officials claim to have skillfully managed the fiscal situation, it is best to be skeptical. Fiscal prudence may be the result of unpaid bills or short release of subsidy."
15 Freedoms We Demand This Independence Day Because Life Has Got Complicated,"India will celebrate its 70th Independence Day in seven days and it makes us wonder the many freedoms we desperately need in order to be free from the shackles of societal evils that threaten to muffle our voice and kill our rights.

Today, we demand certain freedoms because life, as we know it, has become way too complicated.

1. Freedom from cyber-bullying

If anyone has any confusion as to what online bullying refers to, it means the suppression of your dignity by anyone who has been given the freedom of speech. Is one freedom supposed to snatch away another?

facts.net

Hell, no! Stricter governance, airtight laws, and basic sensitisation are required to fight the menace of cyber-bullying. Because when it goes too far, it ends up ending a life.

2. Freedom from selfies

Already hundreds have fallen into rivers and run over by trains while trying to click themselves. Incidents such as these have already made India a nation with the highest number of selfie deaths in the world. That's something we should be least proud of.

AP

What we should beam about is our self-worth which a selfie can in no way capture.

3. Freedom to display affection publicly

India, it seems, will forever remain averse to PDA. Kissing, hugging, and even hand-holding are frowned upon by uncles and aunties, by rickshaw-wallas and auto drivers. Why? Because it's not abusing. It's not lynching. It's moral corruption of our society at large.

bccl

God save us if we express our affection to a fellow human! That will be the end of humanity altogether.

4. Freedom from body-shaming

Let's be clear about it - body shaming is one of the worst forms of abusing someone's freedom to be alive. Apart from blowing our self-esteem to bits, it fosters a culture where our nation is seen as one that is intolerant toward how others choose their lifestyle. Who are we to judge what others eat or wear?

getty images

People can balloon up or shrink down - it's entirely their prerogative. By constantly mocking or humiliating others, we expose ourselves as incapable of acceptance and love.

5. Freedom from gender policing

Men and women are expected to function according to the diktats that rule their gender. Men shouldn't cry and women shouldn't wear jeans. Gender policing is harmful not only to the individual but to the society at large.

afp

Women are conquering the realms of corporate world and men are taking paternity leave to take care of their children. Stereotypes are being broken. Accept that, society!

6. Freedom from misandry

There's no denying that India is becoming more and more unsafe for women. But that doesn't mean that all men must be blamed. Not all men are stalkers and rapists. Honourable men do exist who know better than to outrage a woman's modesty.

getty images

But male-bashing in the name of feminism is another thing we demand freedom from. It's not a battle between men and women. It's a fight for women's safety and bringing every perpetrator of a crime to justice.

7. Freedom of identity

Similar to how we crave to carve our own identity in the world - as a musician or a writer - homosexuals are fighting to win theirs when it's a fight that should have never even started. They are as normal as any heterosexual. They are not an outcast. Their identity is certainly not a disease.

bccl

And those supporting their homosexual friends, in their fight to be identified, should be allowed to do so without any ground rules or threats. It's a freedom of dignified existence that we demand.

8. Freedom of religion

Despite being a fundamental right, this is perhaps the most controversial freedom in India. Being proud of the religion we call our own doesn't warrant killings in the name of the religion our neighbour follows. If we can hope for others to respect our religion, it's our duty to extend the favour.

imgur

Because it's simply not our business to meddle in someone else's beliefs and force upon them what we uphold. Because then that simply makes us unpatriotic.

9. Freedom from justifications

A woman gets raped, she must have worn a skirt. A man supports Pakistan in a cricket match, he must be an 'anti-national'. We are so quick to justify a situation, we often forget to see how blinded our mind's eye is.

playbuzz.com

Justifying situations such as these, which really don't need any justification, only goes to curb the freedom of individualism. (By the way, supporting Pakistan in a cricket match is no big deal!)

10. Freedom from mansplaining

Again, not all men are guilty here. When a man 'mansplains' something to a woman, he speaks over her. He interrupts her on something she may already be an expert at. A man functions on the assumption that he knows more than the women he mansplains. He thinks that they are ignorant and come without any knowledge.

mtvindia

Freedom from mansplaining, therefore, needs to be demanded now, tomorrow, and every day thereafter.

11. Freedom to express humour

We are literally standing on the edge of the cliff that will break as soon as someone cracks another joke. Remember AIB Roast, anyone? It was followed by numerous FIRs simply because the nation had lost its ability to laugh at humour.

rediff

Indians are not serious, uptight beings. They are carefree and love to joke. Then why are we hell bent on killing this aspect of our freedom of expression when it's so harmless, it only tickles our funny bone?

12. Freedom to choose a career

Everyone needs to take a chill pill - parents, aunties, uncles, drivers, everyone! India's obsession with medical and engineering is unfaltering but that doesn't call for ruining a child's future simply because he/she wants to become a nurse or a video producer.

bccl

Career options, nowadays, add up to more than what this year is called. The world's growing, why must we stop our children or siblings from pursuing what their heart desires?

13. Freedom from slut-shaming

If a celebrity posts photos of herself breastfeeding her baby, she will most often than not get slut-shamed on social media for reasons varying from vulgarity to attention-seeking. Hence, there's no shame in demanding freedom from those who choose to see the perverse in something so beautiful.

The Libertarian Republic

People who cross the line need to get in line. Their filth is something that all of us can do without.

14. Freedom of speech

Here's another fundamental right which goes 'poof!' within seconds because of intolerance. People outraging at Sonu Nigam for his tweet on azaan was a testament to how this freedom was manipulated and will continue to get misconstrued at every step of the way.

pti

We crib and complain every day about things we dislike. Then why lose our marbles when someone points out what annoys them?

15. Freedom to be

An all-encompassing freedom, this one affects all aspects of our life - be it at home or outside or in the workplace. It's a freedom that knows no harassment, outraging or shaming. It's a right that was awarded to us the moment we took birth.

bccl

It's a freedom we should never have to plead for."

Only the fit will survive: Ravi Shastri

K Shriniwas Rao • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 06:44 AM

Irrespective of how much I may contribute, eventually it is the captain who walks out with the eleven when it matters. © AFP

Given all the drama that surrounded the selection of the coach before they left for the tour of Sri Lanka late in July, a 3-0 series sweep like this one, wrapped up in just under eleven days, has once again brought the smiles back in the Indian camp. Ravi Shastri, back in a very familiar setting that he had helped put in place during his previous stint, is understandably elated. In an exclusive chat with TOI, Shastri talks about the road map ahead, his chemistry with the cricketers and his role going forward. Excerpts...

This was a first: A series sweep away from home. It should instil a good deal of aggression and positivity.

When was the last time that Sri Lanka were beaten like this at home? I'd like to wait and see how some other teams will cope against this same Sri Lankan team in the near future. But then, this is not about Sri Lanka, this is about the Indian team and the manner in which they've stamped their authority here. India's lowest score in this series (487) was still a 100-odd runs more than the best that Sri Lanka could manage throughout the three Tests. So, that should sum-up the total dominance, with the bat and ball.

What are the takeaways for the team after a performance like this?

Even if this team ends up losing a game, as long as they can walk out of the field with their heads held high, knowing that they gave their best, there's no problem whatsoever. A disciplined approach is what counts. For instance, look at this series. Barring the two no-balls in the second Test from Hardik [Pandya] and one in the third game from [Mohammad] Shami, we've not faltered. How many catches did we drop throughout this series? Two? Going forward, that is what we need to avoid. It's the effort that counts and in that, if we have to look at the bigger picture, we're taking away more than what the scorecard will convey.

The bowling unit has been coming together splendidly...

Bharath Arun has known these youngsters for such a long time now. Look at Kuldeep [Yadav], for instance. He's been tracking Kuldeep's growth from the Under-16 days. It's the same with some of the others he's worked with for a while now. So, in that sense, there's a sense of familiarity that's also helping. We've always seen Kuldeep as a guy with great potential but let's not go on harping about it. One step at a time. Not just the Test team, even [in] the ODIs, now that we have the likes of Jasprit [Bumrah] and Axar [Patel] coming in, they've all worked with Arun and I am keen to see things moving forward from here.

Hardik made a huge impression in the series...

Hardik may still be new to Test cricket but he's showing what a quick learner he is. As Virat [Kohli] said, he's been the biggest positive of this series. He was working on the cutters for the first time on the morning of the day's play with Arun and he didn't flinch once in going out and testing it the same day. That kind of confidence is what you need at this level.

He can add good balance to the attack if you only have to go in with two pacers...

Of course. But look at Shami and Yadav. They have been relentless. Look at the kind of surfaces that were on offer and these two continuously kept clocking between 141 and 145 kmph. To watch them in action on Day 2 of the game was very satisfying, knowing that these tracks hardly gave them any assistance.

And the fielding too... you've been quite focused on that front...

Oh yes. That's what I also talked about in my interview. When the time comes for India to field a side for the 2019 50-over World Cup, we should have the best fielding eleven in the world. The fittest of the lot and that's right up there in the list of priorities.

You really don't mind showering praise on individuals when you have to...

A few good words don't just make your day but they also give you the sense of belonging and confidence to take the next big step forward. A lot is spoken about coaching an international team. This team loves the pressure they face and the players see it as a challenge. Cynicism and negativity can kill all the joy. I'm not that kind of a guy. I look at the glass as being half-full.

And when there's enough trust and confidence in a healthy working relationship, things begin to look so much better from the outside.

Well, the trust is there. I can't speak for the time when I wasn't around, but what I can say with a sense of absolute belief is that nothing has changed between how things were during my last stint and now.

What is it about you and this Indian team that they have absolute faith in you?

Well, that is for the players to answer. I have a job to do and in my close to 35-year career as a cricketer and a commentator and the other roles that I've handled, I've always tried to give my best. All I can say is that the sense of trust comes from the players knowing that they have someone around who they can walk up to and discuss anything they want. If I really want to make lives difficult in order to get 100% commitment from the other guy, I can very well do that and everybody in this set-up knows what I'm talking about. Yet, at the same time, I don't believe in unnecessary interference. Everybody in this set-up has a responsibility carved out and come what may , that responsibility needs to be carried out to the best of the ability. My job is to ensure this is happening on a daily basis and outside of this, anything that needs to be done in the interest of the team.

A word on Wriddhiman Saha....

Saha has been excellent, be it his wicketkeeping, batting or catching. He had always been an unwavering guy in domestic cricket for years and that hard work is showing. He's grown so much in confidence and remember, he's walking into MS' [Dhoni] shoes. He's done phenomenally well to grow out of that shadow. The kind of 'keeping he came up with in this series - on the kind of surfaces that were on offer - makes him the No. 1 wicketkeeper in the world right now.

Batting seems to be the last of your worries...

To be honest, with a batting unit like this one, the last thing you'd do is lose sleep. The core is such a good one and I'm glad the way Shikhar [Dhawan] is timing the ball. He's got two big hundreds that have put him in the frame of mind that he loves to be in.

Cheteshwar [Pujara] has been batting like a dream and he's in a zone where he has set his targets going forward. And as if all of this wasn't enough, you saw a knock of a different kind here the other day. Hardik's century simply changed the course of an entire Test in less than an hour. We were thinking of going forward by 60 to 80 runs when the tail was batting and look where we ended. Five batsmen got a hundred in this series and close to 10 cricketers got 50-plus scores, which is a first in Test cricket for any team.

You keep insisting 'this is Virat's team' and you're just an extension. Can you elaborate?

I've always maintained this, not just now but even in my earlier stint that this is Virat's team. Prior to when he took over as captain, it was MS Dhoni's bunch and he nurtured some of the boys who've prospered today. The captain is the leader of the pack and the coach is an extension of that role, in the sense that it's the coach's responsibility to ensure that everything is in order for the team and its skipper to go and give their best. These are the principles I followed in my previous stint too. Irrespective of how much I or anyone else may contribute, eventually it is the captain who walks out with the eleven when it matters. Too much importance is given to other things, which is unnecessary. What matters is whether there's confidence and trust between all the individuals and that is my responsibility, to ensure there's enough of it.

There are some big Test series coming up next year, followed by the World Cup in 2019. Has the team sorted its priorities?

The World Cup has its own space that needs to be respected. And while that remains the goal, we must realise that if India need to show their might in the game, achieving results in Test cricket is the pinnacle. Now, these are two different sets of goals altogether. Both need to be pursued with equal amount of zeal and yet, both require a completely different level of preparation. Look at countries like England and Australia and how they perceive the game. Playing top-notch Test cricket and excelling in it is what they want to do. World Cups keep coming every four years and of course, we all understand its importance from a global and fan perspective. But if this team really has to be tested, then it's Test cricket and we have plenty of it coming up next year.

Assam Floods: Complexities of Disaster risk reduction,"Assam floods indicate impact of disaster is being determined by several inter-linked factors. These factors are unique in different parts of the same region. Therefore, the exercise of devising strategies for disaster risk reduction to deal with flood becomes multifaceted. The flood situation in Assam created by incessant rainfall and overflowing of the Brahmaputra has taken several lives and caused injuries across many districts. Assam is still struggling to deal with the ongoing floods and has also dealt with the similar situation in the past.

According to Assam State disaster management Authority report of 14th August, 2017, floods have affected 25 of the state’s 32 districts. In all 3,192 villages are reported to be inundated. Nearly 32 lakh people are directly affected. Nine of the state’s rivers are flowing above the danger level.

The nature, type and cause of floods across different parts of the state are different. In some areas flood situation is worsened due to high level of siltation and rising river bed. This is specially the case in Majuli district.

Poor maintenance and resultant failure of embankments and erosional activities are other contributing factors leading to recurrence of floods causing high magnitude of losses and damages.

Floods in urban areas such as Guwahati are a result of yet another set of contributing factors such as inadequate urban drainage, poor maintenance of drains and improper land use planning. A single flood event can not be attributed to climate change but shifting rainfall pattern is also influencing the characteristics of the floods.

In such a context, disaster risk reduction efforts to reduce flood losses require due attention to not only the direct causes but also the social milieu, economic diaspora, natural environment, ethical and cultural practices. These processes are complex in nature owing to historical background and the present processes of development and urbanization. Culture influences to a large extent affect the implementation of strategies and policies.

To deal with these processes, strategies and implementation will call for a new approach undertaking pro-active initiatives to involve techno-social-cultural-economic-environmental-governance initiatives.

Social factors including education, awareness and social capital will determine to a large extent the success and failure of these strategies, included therein the ideas of economic disparity and the brutality of market forces during and post flood situation. Dualistic nature of cultural practices needs to be taken into account in fitting the solutions wherever required.

Technological solutions can be harnessed. The use of technology is prevalent in our day-to-day lives. The emergence of smart phones and its wide range of users cannot be ignored as a resource which can be used for multiple purposes like imparting training programmes, updates and basic Dos and Don’ts of different disaster events. Most of the solutions in the technological arena of disaster management can be achieved with optimum utilization of what we think is minimum (Just owning a smart phone).

The challenges to be tackled are continued from the previous disasters pertaining to livelihood practices and its sustainability and vulnerabilities. The tackling of new risks becomes difficult because the existing risks are dynamic in nature and therefore the process of crafting solutions becomes even more complex.

We very much respond to floods but not much of recovery work is seen as we are still standing at a point where we are offering only short-term response. Much of capacity building strategies like preparedness, prevention and mitigation are operational but need to be revisited for a larger, greater, broader understanding, commitment, involvement and efficient delivery of services.

Disaster risk reduction is a long term process entailing a wide coverage of issues and understanding of multiple dimensions of communities’ vulnerability and resilience. Disaster risk reduction becomes a locally-specific solution strategy wherein specificities, region specific issues, community resilience practices need to be taken into consideration.

The realization of disaster risk reduction goals demands a detailed and broader approach where strengths, weaknesses, challenges and unique local features are fully taken into account over the long run."

Buy HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX (2FK60PA) Laptop (Core i5 7th Gen/8 GB/1 TB 8 GB SSD/Windows 10/2 GB) Online at Best Price in India,"NEW DELHI: Hewlett-Packard has been a brand to reckon with when it comes to laptops and PCs. It has always made its presence felt in top ranks with some of the best value-for-money offerings. However, from time to time one needs to keep growing its product portfolio and HP has done just that this year, at least in India.After expanding its Omen range of gaming laptops and PCs in the country, the US-based PC-maker recently refreshed its 'Pavillion' laptop series with the x360 hybrid-laptop. You'll have to shell out Rs 40,290 for its base model (11-inch screen variant). The most powerful variant goes for Rs 80,000 and upwards. With the Pavilion x360, HP aims to bring a powerful yet good looking computing machine, rounding off the hybrid-laptop as a complete package.We assessed the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX), which is priced at Rs 72,290 and have loads to talk about its performance and design. Curious if it comes with all the hallmarks of an all-in-one laptop? The review below might help you contemplate the decision.HP, since last year, started focussing more towards the design of its laptops and hybrid laptops rather than concentrating only on the performance. While its high-end 'Spectre' range was already visually appealing, a major shift in the overall laptop design strategy across other sub-brands was seen ever since the launch of the HP Spectre, which still remains one of the thinnest laptop ever.The Pavilion x360 plays on the same idea and brings a spin of ""premiumness"" with it. The 2-in-1 laptop looks elegant as it is complimented by a brushed metal look from all sides. The HP logo comes with a mix of mirror finish and so do the laptop hinges, all of which look decent when teamed up in a single package. Although negligible, the power button on the side and the rim enclosing the touchpad also sport the same shiny metallic look.The backlit keyboard adopts the same brushed metal appearance, making the design profile stable across the board. The speaker grille is placed above the keyboard layout. Although we'll talk about the audio quality later, what may bother few users is the placement of the speaker itself. Given the 2-in-1 design of the laptop, the dual speakers, while using the x360 in certain modes, throw the sound in completely opposite direction. For instance, when using in the tent mode you'll notice the speaker facing outwards, which is not much appreciated.The laptop is neither extremely slim, nor is it extremely light-weight. It is thick but not like your regular laptops. The device weighs 1.32 kg, which is considerably low as compared to some chunky workstations out there.HP has made sure that its Pavilion x360 doesn't excise on anything when it comes to connectivity. Majority of the left side of the Pavilion x360 is taken by the exhaust grille along with the power button on the corner, 3.5mm headphone slot and volume controllers. On the right, there is a charging slot, two USB 3.0 slots, a mini HDMI slot, a USB 2.0 Type-C slot and a card reader, all of which are used on a daily basis.Coming to the screen, the review unit we received (HP Pavilion x360 14-ba073TX) sported a 14-inch display with support for touch for easy use. The resolution carried here is 1080x1920 pixels (full HD), which in our opinion is decent enough for a 14-incher. QHD displays do add to the clarity and soar the pixel density, but for an everyday user full HD seems appropriate.At any point in time you can switch from traditional typing to touch screen without even folding the 2-in-1 to activate the tablet mode. Like we've seen with almost all the Windows 10 hybrid laptops, the Pavilion x360 too automatically changes the layout of the apps and the home screen as soon as it crosses the 180-degree folding angle.The usual options to tweak the brightness and dimness of the screen, activating Bluelight filter, changing fonts, text sizes, screen resolution and screen orientation are present. In the tablet mode, the screen auto rotates based on how you are holding the device, something which is common with nearly all the hybrid laptops. Watching movies and TV shows online was a delight. Watching 4K videos on the full HD screen won't make a difference in your viewing experience.The HP Pavilion x360 unit we received is one of the high-end variants in the series. Other variants come with different processor, RAM and screen size combinations. Our unit, the one which runs quad-core Intel Core i5 - 7200U ('Kaby Lake' 7th generation) processor, slid across apps like a hot knife on butter, giving zero lags at any given point of time. The processing power is complemented with 8GB RAM, which is once again, pretty decent for everyday use. With 1TB hard drive, you can store a bunch of TV shows and movies as well.Playing games, editing documents, videos and images were smooth and so was browsing through social media apps like Facebook, Messenger, Mails and more, courtesy Intel HD Graphics 620 and Nvidia GeForce 940MX GPU with dedicated 2GB DDR3 memory.Changing the laptop mode to tablet mode is also swift. Like it's the case with almost all hybrid laptops, you can use the Pavilion x360 in Stand Mode, Tent Mode, Tablet Mode and the usual Laptop mode. Binge watching movies and TV shows are something you will appreciate on the Pavilion x360 as the full HD display works in tandem with Bang & Olufsen-tuned speakers. However, the screen is reflective more than usual, so using it with artificial lights around could prove to be a hassle.The laptop scores 4250 on PC Mark and P8 194 on 3D Mark, both of which are pretty decent given the latest processor, 8GB RAM and the Nvidia-powered GPU.The device's user experience comes festooned with Windows 10 Home which is fast and comes with usual set of features, including Cortana. Some pre-installed apps however, can spoil the essence of an impressive user experience. HP Pavilion x360, above and beyond Windows 10, packs bloatware with some unwanted apps such as Agoda.com, WildTangent Games app, Minecraft and Solitaire. There are some HP-made apps as well like HP AudioSwitch, HP Orbit, HP Pen Control.Talking about the HP Pen Control, the laptop comes with a stylus. The stylus definitely bumps up the productivity of a user but is not as fluid as you would expect. The HP Pen Control app you can assign different actions to the stylus' two buttons. You would also have to change the single-cell AAAA battery that goes inside the stylus.As for the apps and services, HP Pavilion x360n also includes MS Office Home & Student 2016 Lifetime full version worth Rs 5999.You won't face any heating issues with the Pavilion x360 no matter you run 4K videos, play games, stream content online or perform all these actions while keeping the hybrid laptop plugged into a charging point.Video chatting is nothing but smooth sailing with the Pavilion x360. The images clicked by the webcam are in HD resolution and the videos shoot in the same resolution at 30 frames per second, something that makes it just enough to make the cut when it comes video calling.The history of battery performance with hybrid laptops have been pretty average and somewhat consistent since last couple of years. Most of them work for a few hours, given the heavy processing of apps. With the HP Pavilion x360 the case is slightly unusual. The laptop, as HP says, has a 'liberating' battery life as it can run for up to 9 hours and 15 minutes on a single charge. However, this is in ideal conditions. In our day-to-day usage, the device ran for around 7 hours before giving up.Heavy usage, which includes streaming videos, playing 4K movies and playing heavy games may result in even quicker drainage of battery.The HP Pavilion x360 certainly raises the level of game every other PC maker is playing when it comes to mid-range laptops in India. The sub-brand, which once was known for offering mid-range laptops, although is moving towards more premium price bracket, it still takes some cues from other sub-brands as well such as the Spectre in terms of design and HP Envy in terms of performance.The device is an amalgamation of one of the best processors along with impressive speakers, decent screen, an average battery life, all encapsulated in a good-looking design. There are no such features that are either egregious or garish with the Pavilion x360.At Rs 72,290, the HP Pavilion x360 (14-ba073TX) is neither for heavy gaming nor for hardcore tasks. Instead, this hybrid laptop is something which could prove to be a hit not only with multimedia consumers but with young generation graphic designers as well who don't want their laptops to be extremely high-end ones with beefy innards and chunky look. They want a well performing laptop that looks good and can also be used casually. And HP seems to have hit that very nerve with the Pavilion x360."
Things you shouldn’t say on a first date,"

First dates are tricky and can either make or break a prospective relationship. The whole idea is to get to know one another and have fun while figuring out if you’re compatible with each other. However, there are certain things that are better unsaid on first dates.

Why August 15 was chosen for India's Independence Day...,"2

70th Indian Independence Day

Many prominent leaders were arrested as a result. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose managed to escape and reach foreign lands. He formed the Indian National Army (INA) to overthrow the British in India. With the help of Japan, Bose freed the Andaman and Nicobar Islands from the British and returned to India via the North Eastern border. However, with the Japanese being defeated in World War II (WWII), he had to retrace his steps and was eventually killed."
Recruitment drive: What the government needs to do to create millions of jobs 😜,"Two scholarly-looking people in serious conversation.

1st scholar: The minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkariji, has very rightly said that driverless automobiles, like the Tesla, will not be allowed in India. As Nitinji pointed out, driverless cars would make millions of drivers lose their jobs.

2nd scholar: Too true, bro. All us PhDs and research scientists who drive taxis, and trucks, and buses, and private cars, and sarkari cars would be jobless and out on the street.

1st scholar: Yeah. Because the country’s job market being what it is, driving taxis and trucks, and buses, etc are the only jobs we can get. And the competition is getting fiercer and fiercer.

2nd scholar: You’re telling me. Why, just the other day there was this guy, a chit of a double MA from JNU or someplace, asking if he could get a job as a driver. I told him that at this rate mere graduates, BScs, and BComs, and BAs would start lining up too, bringing our standards down.

1st scholar: Well said. But banning driverless cars to give people employment isn’t good enough. We should ban all wheels.

2nd scholar: You mean disinvent the wheel?

1st scholar: Exactly. The wheel has been the single biggest invention to create joblessness. Before the wheel, people had to go in palkis, or palanquins, in which four people were needed to carry one person. Eight people, if the person was very large, as some of these mantrijis and sethjis can be.

2nd scholar: I see what you mean. With the invention of the wheel, one person driving a bullock cart, or car, or taxi, or bus, could carry lots of people. So if we scrapped all wheels and brought back palkis we’d create millions more jobs for guys like us. Great idea! Shall we go tell Nitinji about it? I’ll go get my malik’s car.

1st scholar: Car, shar. We must start as we mean to go on. Go get a palki and three other chaps to carry me as the passenger.

2nd scholar: Uh, oh. I knew there had to be a catch somewhere…."
"While Celebrating The Patriotic Spirit From Assam, Let Us Not Forget The Grim Flood Situation There","This is arguably one of the most shared images on social media in the past two days. Four people including two children who are almost neck deep in water saluting the tricolour hoisted on the occasion of India's 71st Independence Day.

The man who hoisted the flag is Tazem Sikder, the headmaster of a government run Naskara lower primary school in Dhubri, Assam. Others seen in the picture are Mizanur Rahman, a teacher along with Jiarul Ali Khan and Haider Ali Khan, two Class 3 students.

The image shared by Mizanur Rahman was an instant hit on Tuesday as the nation celebrated Independence Day.

Others too shared images from various parts of Assam where people 'celebrated' Independence Day amid heavy flooding across the state.

ANI

They too were widely circulated across various social media platforms lauding the patriotic spirit of the Assamese people. But many seemed to have failed to notice one prominent thing in all those images -- the flood waters.

Reuters

Assam is currently in the middle of a catastrophic flood, the second flood in less than a month, which has left 33 lakh people displaced and 1.83 lakh hectares of standing crops inundated. 28 people have been killed across the state in the second leg of floodings taking the total death toll this year to 112 so far.

Reuters

Thirty-three lakh people were affected in 25 districts, including Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Sonitpur, Darrang, Baksa, Nalbari, Barpeta and Bongaigaon. Dhemaji district in upper Assam is the worst-hit where nearly one lakh people were affected. Flood water is flowing over the roofs of houses in many areas.

As flood waters were flowing over National Highway 37, communication between upper and lower Assam have snapped. Vehicles were stranded on the highway and being diverted via Nagaland.

Kaziranga National Park, which is home to a large population of rhinos, elephants, tigers, wild buffalos and eastern swamp deer have also been hit badly by the flood, with an estimated 85 per cent of the reserve under water.

This is the worst deluge the north eastern state has witnessed in nearly three decades.

The current flooding is adding to the woes of the state which was almost brought to its knees by heavy rains last month.

The first wave of floods between April and July claimed 85 lives and affected about 19 lakh people in the state.

At least 107 animals, including seven rhinos, died in last month's flood in Kaziranga.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had come under heavy criticism after he rushed to his home state Gujarat, to assess the flood there while ignoring Assam.

He finally visited the state early this month, by the time the initial flood waters had begun receding."
Saha's 'immeasurable' brilliance leaves the world gasping,"Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp with his wicketkeeping skills in the Colombo Test © Getty

When pitches start to wither, when the bounce gets fickle, when a ball throws up dust on hitting the turf, it is the batsmen you worry about. ""Oooh"" we go when one takes off past the shoulder of the bat or hurtles through at ankle height. The spinner has a mischievous grin, the batsman the look of a condemned man.

You don't think too much about the wicketkeeper though. The byes that result from a wicked surface go against his name and if he keeps a clean sheet, it doesn't stare at you from a scorecard a fortnight later. And yet, as much as the batsman almost, he has to combat the surface. If the batsman is beaten, he lives another day, if the 'keeper is beaten, it is four byes and slip looks at short leg with a twisted smile and a raised eyebrow.

I thought of that over the last couple of days of the Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo. Normally, the batsmen are on the guest list there. Hundreds are strewn around and if you are Mahela Jayawardene, you only count the runs after the mandatory hundred has appeared. But this track was different. It was powdery to start off and by the third morning, the ball was spitting and bouncing. By the fourth morning, the odd one was taking off almost vertically as Dimuth Karunaratne and Mathews discovered.

And yet, every time the ball beat the bat, at varying heights, it found a comforting glove. Every time it acquired a mind of its own after pitching, it was arrested and returned to the bowler. There were no oohs and aahs, no exaggerated reactions, just a calm gather and a crouch for the next ball. Keeping was hazardous but Wriddhiman Saha made it look like just another balance-sheet to be put together and filed away.

I have very rarely seen wicket-keeping like this. Maybe Nayan Mongia standing up to Anil Kumble's rockets on a pitch of variable bounce. Maybe Syed Kirmani at his peak. Kiran More was good and MS Dhoni brought his own style to a difficult job and rarely had a bad day. But Saha, so understated, was a treat to watch. Only once in the second innings was he beaten and he would have needed a fisherman's net to catch that one. And when he caught Mathews off another Jadeja sortie that bombed the pitch, we gasped.

Jadeja was bowling in the high nineties, more than ten kmph faster than Ashwin who was going past the outside edge for fun himself, more than 15 kmph faster than Herath on average and a good 20 kmph quicker than the debutant Pushpakumara. When he felt like it, he crossed 100 kmph. After he faced the first ball, Mathews asked for an arm-guard because the first one hissed at him violently.

But Saha seemed unperturbed. Indeed, amusing as it seems, taking a DRS call seemed to fluster him more. He couldn't have known where the ball was headed and yet it seemed he did. In our commentary box, Vijay Dahiya, no mean 'keeper himself, was rejoicing. Ajay Jadeja wanted to make him the Man of the Match.

In time to come, there will be nothing to measure Saha's brilliance, no scorecard will be read in reverence, no highlights packages will be preserved, no accolades offered on awards nights.

But the eyes saw it. And left imprints behind. Sometimes sport makes you gasp at the skill on display. Saha made you gasp in Colombo.

Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story,"SPOTLIGHT Surviving Tsunami to leading Sri Lanka - the Chandimal story Vishaal Loganathan Share Tweet Share

All of 15 when the tsunami hit, Dinesh Chandimal saw, lost, won and lived through it, as he intends to do the same for Sri Lankan cricket now © Getty

As a 15-year-old, Dinesh Chandimal sat at home and watched on TV as Sri Lanka were handed a hammering by New Zealand in Auckland. More than 10000 kilometers away, in Ambalangoda, Chandimal was watching intently hoping to gather whatever points he could. He had to. Chandimal had packed his bags and his cricketing gear the day earlier. He had been called up for the trials for the Sri Lankan Under-15 team. It was to be one of the first steps towards realising a lifelong goal.

It was a poya, full moon day, and as usual the house was being cleaned. Chandimal's mother had stepped out to clear the garbage. Moments later, he heard a screech from his mother. ""Actually, we thought it was a snake or something,"" says Chandimal. But it was the tsunami, or 'The Devil', as Chandimal constantly says.

Ambalangoda was one of the worst hit areas. The waves were more than 15 feet high and came in at a rapid pace. After the first wave had hit the village, the waters drew back, before coming back stronger and more menacingly. The devastation left thousands homeless, hopeless, hungry and frightened. It killed as many, if not more.

""We went there and saw, and one of the uncles in our village, he came and saw for just five seconds and said 'the tsunami has come as a devil'. He said to us 'Please run with your children.' He shouted to us. Then, we ran. Ran for, I think, 200-300 meters. Fortunately, there was a hill. So we ran to that hill and we stayed there. From there, we saw our home and everything going like foam.""

""The tsunami came as the devil,"" Chandimal repeatedly says while talking about that fateful day. Until then, he hadn't even heard the word 'tsunami'. The incidents and memories of that day are fresh and vivid in his mind, and the pain in his voice is all too apparent. He watched his house, his recently-packed kit bag and everything he and his family owned being washed away by the sea. It swallowed up everything, but it also left in its wake a swathe of dead bodies, people Chandimal would've known. Chandimal could only watch on helpless from atop a hill. He and his family were safe, for now.

In the aftermath of the tsunami, a shaken Chandimal went hunting for his kit bag. He had to travel to Colombo for the trials. He found his bag more than two kilometers away, wet and useless. Chandimal wasn't stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea, here the devil was the deep blue sea.

It left him and his family with mental scars that won't easily be erased. ""Of course, it's always at the back of our minds. After tsunami, we went to the sea only twice. That much we were scared as a family. But you know that's the way life goes...""

The events of December 26, 2004, strengthened Chandimal. His family was now without a house, without any clothes or food. It made him resolute, his family's well-being became his main focus and he ensured he reached his goal through cricket.

""One time, in 2004, we didn't have a house to stay. This is a hotel,"" he says, looking around the swanky MovenPick Hotel in Colombo. ""My parents and my family and myself, we put a lot of hard work for me to become a player and a captain. The word is hard work.""

""We were affected by tsunami. We lost everything. Tsunami came as the devil and broke everything. So actually that (motivated me) to become an international cricketer and become a good cricketer. So that was the strength I think, after the tsunami. Then I was thinking I have to stick to my cricket, then I put some target - I want to be this, I want to be this man, this player and stuff.

""One or two months, we struggled as a family. We didn't have a place to stay. (We had) food issues, some clothes issues... So, but I think that gave me really good (motivation) to become a good cricketer.""

So when the opportunity to take his cricket to the next level came calling, Chandimal accepted it, albeit with a heavy heart. The current Test captain was the star of his team, Dharmasoka College, with both bat and behind the wickets. ""My wicketkeeping was superb in that time, I was flying to take catches. No mistakes! Like now,"" he laughs.

Against Ananda College, he was the only player to show some fight, scoring 77 not out as the team folded for 120. The coach of Ananda College, Udayananda Perera, was soon at his house, asking his parents to send him to Colombo.

""Actually, my parents pushed me to go to Ananda College. I didn't want to go. Because in Dharmasoka College, it was my first school and I loved playing there, in my home town. My parents told me, 'If you're there (Ananda College), at least you can get a good job. So then, I said 'Okay, I should go now because we have so many family problems.' We didn't have a good home, actually. For six months, we stayed at the government apartments. We were there for six months. So then I felt 'Okay, I should go, I should come to Colombo and play cricket'.

At Ananda College, Chandimal put in the hard yards. His days in the hostel were far from a breeze. He was not with his family, and the food was not to his liking. But he ensured he always put on a smile when his family asked about him.

""I didn't know (anyone in Colombo). I stayed at the hostel, Ananda hostel, for 3-4 years. And I used to eat that hostel food. It's always tough (laughs). Sometimes my parents called me and asked 'Son, are you okay with the food? Are you okay with the stay?' But sometimes, I'm not okay with the food, sometimes I didn't take my breakfast because breakfast was not good to eat. But I didn't say anything to them. I said, 'Yes, I am fine'. And so that's the way I was there at the hostel.""

But it was not all gloom, either. Chandimal maintained a good relationship with everyone at the college, and he was repaid with kindness. He is not sure why, but ventures that maybe it was because of his good behaviour.

""There were the workers, they gave a lot of help to me. Sometimes, when I am not there, when I am out for practice, they make my food, and when I come to the hostel, they bring it to my room. They took care of me really well. I just love to talk the right things with the good people. I feel that's why they loved me.""

From running for his life to now running the country's Test team, Chandimal's life has been a ride full of ups and downs.

Even as captain of the Sri Lankan Test team, Chandimal goes through the bumps regularly. He was handed over the side after Angelo Mathews decided he could not handle captaincy any more. Soon after, he watched as his side suffered a whitewash at home to India. He still has utmost confidence in his team, and says it has the right ingredients. Now his focus is on ensuring all the players play with freedom, to rid his team of any fears, or problems.

""It's really an honour and a privilege to be the captain of Sri Lanka cricket team. I came with a really hard youth, tough times. I had tough times, good times. As a captain and a player, I just want to give the good things for my players. I just want to take care of them as my brothers. If something happens on the outside, I just want to control that and give good freedom to the youngsters to perform well.

""I just want to, as a captain, take the responsibility or blame. Anything from the outside and I'll get that as a captain. I just want to be relaxed and not put any pressure on my players. That is what I wanted to do. Because I know the hard times, when it comes to you. Actually, once I got my Test captaincy, I said to the players, 'I just want unity first, then attitude, focus, discipline and passion'. That's what I am always discussing with players and staff.""

Just like he did with his family, Chandimal always puts his team first. It's what he did when he was first made the captain too, in 2013.

""To be honest, I was struggling in 2014 with the pressure. Then after that I learnt a lot from that. How to handle the pressure. How to handle the people. How to handle players, how they're thinking and stuff. That gave me a lot of learning. Now, I can take more pressure, and give freedom to my players. 2013 was a tough time to captain the side, because in that time there were experienced players with a young side. I feel I handled it well. The thing is I didn't perform as a player, because I batted at number 6. In T20s, if you bat at number 6, you get only 2-3 overs. So you can't score big runs. You can get only 10-20 runs. As a captain, I had to open or bat at number 3, but I didn't want to do that.

""Because at that time, there was Kusal Janith (Perera). He was playing outstanding (cricket). So then I thought it is better to play Kusal as opener with Dilshan, there's a left-right hand opening combination. Then we had Mahela, then Sangakkara, then Angelo. I wanted to put the most experienced players in the first 10-15 overs. Then, myself at 6. I didn't think about myself, I just thought about the team. How to win. How to lift the World Cup for my mother country. So that's what I always think as a captain. I don't care about my performance, I don't care about my position. That's my first experience as captain in 2013-14.

Now Chandimal captains the Test side without any of the big names who were around in 2013. He's left shouldering the nation's hopes alongside an oft-injured and probably mentally-drained Mathews, and the ageing Rangana Herath. With the team failing to put up a fight, the task has only gotten harder for Chandimal.

""It's always hard, mate. Specially when you're losing games. There are so many questions, but if you're winning - no questions. When you are doing the right things, I feel we are doing so many bad mistakes. When we are not doing well, we don't do any mistakes. It's always tough. Maybe at the moment, we are like that. We are looking forward to get the good results in the future, within six months or one year.

""If you're playing international cricket, as a player, mental toughness is very important because these days, there's so much media and social media (pressure). Someone doesn't like you and they shout at you and stuff. As a player, you have to keep yourself mentally right and at the same time, you have to do your homework as a batsman or bowler.""

In 2004, Dinesh Chandimal stood on a hill and watched in horror his house being flooded and then being washed away. He resolved to fight for his family and take care of them. He did that through his cricket. Even now, when he speaks to his parents, they credit him for putting them back on their feet. ""They tell me every time I meet them, 'now we are in a good position, that's because of you.' And I say, 'No, not because of me, because of we all put our hard work in as a family. That's why we are here, not only because of me.'""

Now his goals have changed. In 2017, he stands as Sri Lanka's captain and watches as his side slips in one shocking performance after another. He again resolves to fight for his team, and take care of them. He must be the right man to take them forward. Because when you've seen, lost, won and lived through what he's seen, lost, won and lived through, fighting and succeeding is in your blood.

3 Powerful Tricks That Can Help You Mentally Toughen Up To Overcome Any Situation Instantly,"Your mind is as responsible for your failures as much as it is for your success because it rules your thoughts and actions. If you’re able to exert the power of will during your toughest moments, you'll be surprised as to how many times you would come out on top of the situation you feared at one point.

medium.com

These are some simple but key mindfulness building tricks that anyone can and should apply to their lives every day; especially if when you find yourself stuck in a position of confusion, fear or self-doubt in any situation.

dietasulweb

Visualise success before the thought of failure inflicts your mind

By visualising yourself completing the task at hand repeatedly, over and over again, you create what is called a ‘winning mindset’ before going forward and getting into the task at hand.

myempoweredworld.com

If you can see yourself overcoming the hurdles you face before undertaking the task at hand you’re more likely to overcome them without a shadow of a doubt because you’re mind has already been trained to do so.

Use the power of a mantra that you create for yourself and recite it in a tricky situation

‘Mind chatter’ can block you from taking decisive action when you’re stuck in a precarious situation. For instance, if you believe and resonate with the saying “whatever doesn’t kill me will only me me stronger”, repeat it as many times as you need in a situation that demands it.

yallafeed.com

Reciting a positive mantra helps overhaul the ‘mental chatter’ that holds you back or creates feelings of negativity by trick your brain into believing that your only option is to keep going and there’s no point looking back anyway.

Detach yourself from the outcome to accomplish the impossible

Learning how to detach yourself from the result of what you set out to accomplish can be one most powerful ways to get through any task that you’re hesitant to undertake and come back from any setback even stronger.

As you long as you do the best you can in everything you partake in you needn’t take the outcome personally. Instead, walk away knowing that there’s nothing more you can give than you already have at that moment."
"Seventy and young: The India story remains, to this day, one of unrealised potential","Seventy years after 15 August 1947, India has made undeniable progress. But there will be many to question whether the ‘tryst with destiny’ that Jawaharlal Nehru spoke of at the dawn of independence has been realised. PM Narendra Modi called for an end to poverty, illiteracy and corruption last week. Unfortunately, Indian leaders have been making similar calls for decades. The tryst with destiny can only be said to have been realised when such calls have become redundant.

Stepping outside today’s partisan political bickering, what are some structural impediments to India fulfilling its potential? Poor governance is one failing which, in turn, has several causes. Government spreads itself into too many areas, which stretches its resources thin while holding up the development of civil society. Government would do much better if it focussed on a few core areas and delivered quality outcomes in those areas, while not getting in the way of civil society in other areas. A realisation of this is embodied in Modi’s slogan of ‘minimum government, maximum governance’, but that dictum has hardly been put into practice in the last three years. The slow pace of reform means that growth in investments and formal job creation remains weak; farms are in crisis and ‘Make in India’ has hardly taken off, even as millions of young people enter the job market every year.

Related is the fact that the political class imagines social justice largely through the lens of reservation while hardly debating the role of quality school education to uplift the underprivileged. No nation has become prosperous without delivering such education universally. The Mandal legacy has entrenched rather than dislodged caste, even as emphasis on caste-based reservations and quotas has meant patronage- rather than merit-based systems. That in turn feeds poor governance, low productivity and institutional mediocrity. The Mandal legacy, together with the jobs crisis, has also touched off an explosion of caste agitations.

Another tripwire has been India’s ambivalent secularism which stops short of separation of church and state – embodied, for example, in different personal laws for different religions. This ambivalent secularism makes the argument for Hindu majoritarianism seem convincing to many – if the state is to have truck with all religions then (or so the argument goes) it should have more truck with the majority religion. Only a strong secularism can obviate communal tensions and conflict, but no one in the political class seems ready to uphold or deliver this. On the plus side, India stands a reasonable chance of realising its vast potential within the space of a generation. But all of these tripwires will need to be negotiated."
26-Year-Old Man Diagnosed With 'Binge Watching Addiction' Is Somewhere All Of Us,"Well, if you binge watch your favourite TV series by sacrificing your sleep, you’ve got to read this. A 26-year-old, marketing professional in Gurgaon has been diagnosed with “addiction of online binge watching”.

oddyseyonline

He approached the hospital, complaining that he has depression and anxiety, however his psychiatrist found a completely different reason to his problems.

Dr Manish Jain, consultant, department of psychiatry, BLK Super Specialty Hospital, found out that the patient used to watch documentaries and TV shows in one go, due to which he always used to be sleep deprived. For two years, he kept binge watching that led to depression, mind absenteeism and anxiety.

Despite travelling 60-80km to work everyday and working a nine-hour shift, the marketing professional couldn’t let go off his addiction. Despite reaching home late, he always used to watch documentaries and TV shows, instead of sleeping. This made him wake up late in the morning and missing workdays too.

Binge watching addiction has become a lifestyle-related addiction. Watching shows continuously by giving up on sleep and social life can easily lead to depression and anxiety.

The Gurgaon man now has to go through a psychotherapy for curing his addiction.

While many of us binge-watch our favourite TV series, little did we know that it can be a root cause for so many problems? What do you think can be a solution for this? Tell us in the comments section."
Forgo the Hindu Rashtra: Why the Sangh Parivar must work for Indian Rashtra instead,"Dear Sangh Parivar,

On the 75th anniversary of the Quit India movement you drew attention to RSS involvement in the Gandhi-led national movement. Yet there is a great deal of historical evidence to show that even if individual members of the Sangh participated, RSS and Hindu Mahasabha stayed away from the freedom struggle, in fact Hindu Mahasabha boycotted it. Gandhi, with his political vision of India centred squarely on Hindu-Muslim unity has been a problematic figure for you in the past.

Today however you would like to be part of the ‘nationalist’ mainstream. And why not? No political party can claim to own the freedom struggle which belongs to every democrat. It is heartening that you are now adopting a history from which you had chosen to distance yourself.

But if you want to claim an inclusive history, why not aim for an inclusive future, to work towards creating an Indian Rashtra instead of your avowed aim of Hindu Rashtra which smacks of a harsh exclusivism? After all, the last thing you want to be is another Pakistan, a nation constituted on religion which needs the armed forces to define its nationalism. India’s ruling principle is not god and gun. In fact, Indian nationhood can be traced to the truest concept of Hindu dharma, not meaningless regimentation, empty rituals and rigid beliefs, but instead the principle of individual freedom.

Hinduism’s about freedom for the mind and democracy’s about freedom for the citizen. Thought control, re-writing textbooks, insisting only on a single truth, are all imitations of Stalinism or extremist forms of Islam and go against that basic Upanishadic principle of freedom. It’s time for the Sangh to comprehensively reassess its definition of individual freedom, and realise its centrality to Hindu thought.

Since you seek ownership of the pre-1947 nationalist vision will you disown MS Golwalkar’s vision of cultural nationalism being played out so regularly today? Campaigning for the Ram mandir, beef ban slogans, new cattle slaughter rules, attempting to make Vande Mataram mandatory in UP’s madrasas, imposing Sanskrit and veneration of the cow: don’t these show that you are opposing the spirit of Gandhian nationalism?

Trying to make India an exclusivist state where minorities must give up their identity is the very antithesis of the spirit of 1942. Is not PM Modi, himself a former RSS pracharak who speaks so inspiringly of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ in Delhi doing a disservice to inclusive nationalism when he brings up the shamshan-kabristan analogy in UP polls? If former VP Hamid Ansari expresses his concern over growing Muslim insecurity, instead of attacking him as a ‘golf-playing Macaulayputra’, a Gandhian nationalist would attempt to create a wider dialogue. After all, today the representation of Muslims in assemblies and Parliament is at its lowest ever. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted: the very definition of democracy is that the majority will not abuse its power to violate the basic rights of the minority. Democracies are defined by how safe minorities – of gender, food habits, religion, language and sexual orientation – feel.

What was the spirit of 1942? It embraced all. Gandhi was not an opponent of British people, he didn’t call for the British to leave India on racist, ethnic or religious grounds. Instead he called only for the end of imperialist rule. Perhaps that’s why even during the height of the freedom struggle, there were so few instances of violence against Britons. Gandhi fought injustice, not other human beings. No wonder, even Britishers like Madeleine Slade (Mirabehn) and CF Andrews made common cause with Gandhi.

You hark to Hindu victimhood and depredations of Muslim invaders. You feel it is necessary to avenge those historical wrongs. But acts of historical vengeance have brought untold misery. Fratricidal wars between Islamic sects, driven by vengeance, are tearing apart the ideals of Pan Islamism. Hitler’s supremacist ideas and desire for revenge destroyed Germany and almost all of Europe. Sectarian conflict has resulted in loss of thousands of lives in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The urge to build a Ram Temple at a particular spot may satisfy the thirst to get even but will it lead to greater well-being of Hindus? Vengeance only leads to spiritual decay and those wreaking it suffer the most. Historical revenge is another concept that the Sangh needs to rethink.

The idea of the Indian Rashtra is truer to the spirit of the Indian subcontinent’s ancient inheritance than a Hindu Rashtra. That’s because religious divisions in the subcontinent have never stopped constant intermingling of sects. Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Muslim pilgrims have throughout our history had access to each other’s shrines, just as the movement of people, goods and ideas has never been restricted across South Asia. It’s really with the coming of less-than-friendly nation states in the last 70 years that subcontinental ties have become so weakened.

Inclusivity is in the subcontinetal DNA. That’s why when PM Modi refuses to even mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament – the PM who invited Shyama Prasad Mookerjee who later founded the Jana Sangh into his cabinet – the principles of dharma, which the RSS claims to safeguard, are hardly well served.

So why not reinvent your aim of the Hindu Rashtra? Why not change your goal to Indian Rashtra and bring it in tune with the true principles of Hindu dharma, instead of basing it on an imitative version of Leftism or orthodox Islamism. Why not recognise Hinduism’s unobtrusive ‘soft power’, one that’s created the mystic Sufi, the mangalsutra and sari wearing Goan Catholic? It’s time to change the goal of ‘Hindu Rashtra’ to the more inclusive ‘Indian Rashtra.’ The latter reflects not only the spirit of Gandhi and 1942, but also of true Hindu dharma."
FIFA U-17 World Cup: Challenges of putting together a squad,"By Joy Bhattacharjya

The most challenging task while hosting a Junior World Cup, especially for developing football countries, is putting up a competitive squad. All the remaining preparations will not have much value if the Indian team doesn’t compete against its opponents in the FIFA U-17 World Cup. FIFA does not publish junior rankings, but in the list of football nations, five of the top ranked FIFA countries will be in India come October, including World No 1, Brazil. India’s group features the 8th, 26th and 50th ranked countries, and its no help that the lowest-rated team, Ghana, have been monsters in this competition with titles in 1991 and 1995.

The process for putting together this particular team started in April 2014, just a few months after India was awarded the tournament, when a group of 30 odd boys started practicing together in the AIFF academy in Goa. While there have been dropouts due to injury and loss of form, and fresh talent has also been unearthed over the years, at least half the squad is still from the original thirty. Most of the original boys were selected by a set of scouts led by the then Technical Director, Scott O’Donell. The challenges were immense. The first and most important issue was age. Almost 50 per cent of the boys selected could not provide birth certificates. And a fair number of those who seemed to be fine on paper then failed the compulsory wrist magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test that is the most accepted age test in junior football.

In addition, state federation heads were often keen to put forward their favourites, rather than the best players in the state. Finally, the biggest conundrum was whether to select just the best players or also start looking at the players from the point of view of the position they could play. From over two thousand potential candidates, 29 were finally selected, with a shortage of quality left foot players. Almost half that number came from the North East, with Manipur contributing the most players, including the core of the current midfield — Suresh Wangjam, Amarjit Kiyam and Jackson Singh.

While the team started practicing and playing tournaments almost immediately, the process of scouting for new players continued. Abhishek Yadav joined as the CEO of the AIFF U-17 team in 2016, and set upon a punishing schedule of trials. Since June last year, he has personally seen more than twelve thousand boys, many from the smaller districts of traditional powerhouse states like Bengal and Kerala. Aniket Jadhav from Kolhapur was just one of the boys selected, who forced himself into a first XI position in the team almost immediately. The other push has been the online portal, where players of India origin from around the world can upload their match footage for a chance to play for India. Defender Namit Deshpande from New Jersey is one of the two players from the Americas, the other being towering 6’5” goalkeeper Sunny Dhaliwal from Canada.

The exposure given to this team has been unprecedented in Indian football. Over the past couple of years, they have played tournaments and matches in Germany, Spain, South Africa, Brazil and Russia and also participated in the AFC U-16 qualifying tournament in Goa. The team has competed against the likes of Brazil, USA and Russia and while a lot of the matches ended in defeat, the opposing coaches were often impressed by the skills on view. More recently, the team under coach Luis Norton drew 1-1 against a full strength Chile, among the top 10 sides in international soccer, in a tournament in Mexico.

India have never qualified for a FIFA World Cup, senior or junior, men’s or women’s, so the pressure on these thirty is absolutely unprecedented. Talismanic senior striker Sunil Chhetri spoke of how he would cheerfully trade his entire international career for one shot at a World Cup, and these boys bear the burden of all those unfulfilled dreams.

But they have a few things going for them as well. They have played for a long time together and have had enough time to gel as a unit. They have also competed against the best in the world from different football ‘gharanas,’ — from short passing South American and Spanish teams to athletic long ball teams like Tanzania and the German Bundesliga squads, so there aren’t any real surprises. And finally, they will easily be the fittest Indian team ever to play a World Cup, going at full tilt well into stoppage time. As long as they run themselves into the ground and give it their 100 per cent each time, Indian fans will not complain."
Moral Modi and the logic of you all embracing a Kashmiri each,"Even his strongest critics give this to Prime Minister Narendra Modi: he is a very strong communicator. His election campaign speeches can be warlike, his foreign policy speeches are praised for statesmanship, and his Independence Day speeches from the Red Fort have come to be known as sort of moral science lessons to the nation.

For example a standout moment in the 2014 speech was when he pointed to how parents ask their daughters hundreds of questions, but not their sons. Against the backdrop of rising cases of rape, Modi urged parents to put some checks on their sons, ask them where they are going, why they are going and who are their friends – because every rapist is somebody’s son.

This year’s Red Fort speech was also full of quotable moral quotes, like where India used to raise the slogan Bharat choro before Independence it now needs to carol Bharat jodo, rejecting violence in the name of religion. It needs to swap the chalta hai attitude with badal sakta hai, especially to fulfil the dreams of the generation born this century who will turn 18 next year.

But the standout moment of the 71st Independence Day speech was when he talked about solving the problems of Kashmir: “Na gaali se … na goli se … samasya suljhegi har Kashmiri ko gale lagake.” Change will come not by cussing nor by guns but by pulling each and every Kashmiri into a hug.

What gives this rhetoric an extra flourish is that this is a prime minister very well known for his jaadoo ki jhappis. Except they seem to be reserved for the likes of Trump and Nawaz Sharif.

Independence Day in Kashmir itself of course means shutters down, traffic restrictions, mobile and data services disrupted. So cynicism with respect to jhappi promises is understandable. As Omar Abdullah, while welcoming the PM’s words, tweeted, everyone there is weary of “yet more talk & no concrete action.” Perhaps the PM’s words were addressed to the rest of India, urging his legion of devotees to be more thoughtful and compassionate.

It is also a fact that his dominion is such that if Prime Minister Narendra Modi were to literally embrace Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti tomorrow, yes that jhappi could somehow amount to concrete action, that could signify change indeed."
A Samsung Galaxy S5 Drops From Plane While Shooting A Video & It Shockingly Survives The Fall!,"Just like you don't play football without kicking or getting kicked, you don't use a phone without at least dropping it once. It's one of the rules of the universe.

OOPS!

But where most of us drop our phones in the toilet, off the dinner table, or while removing it from our pocket, one guy literally dropped it from a plane up in the sky.

No, we are not even kidding. This actually happened -- at least according to Reddit.

Just over a day ago, a Reddit user posted an interesting video on the popular website under the title ""My Uncle was filming another plane while flying and accidentally dropped it!""

In the video, you can see the phone's point-of-view video as it slips from the pilot's hands and goes into a tailspin and lands in an unsuspecting guy's garden, amidst the flowerbed.

What's stunning about this video -- which is what a lot of people are not yet convinced about -- is that the phone falls from over a thousand feet high and doesn't break apart, falls on its face and continues to record video, catching a guy who ultimately discovers the phone on his property.

The fact that it's a Samsung Galaxy S5 makes the video even more surreal. What are the odds of this happening, right? Brb, calculating...

"A 9.6 Kbps Dial Up Pack Cost Rs 1,250 Per Month, When VSNL Brought Internet To India In 1995","Internet is fast becoming as essential as oxygen in India. Thanks largely to the record low cost of access to Internet, whether it's broadband or cellular 3G/4G.

But 22 years ago, when Internet services first began in the country, getting online was quite expensive! Just look at the rate card below:

VSNL was the first Indian entity to offer Internet access in the country 22 years ago / @MumbaiHeritage

In case you don't know, VSNL or Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd was a government entity responsible for connecting India to the Internet. VSNL started offering Internet services to Indians 22 years ago on 15th August, 1995. And the early Internet adopters of the country had to shell out a lot of money to get online.

Rs 1,250 per month for a 9.6 kbps dial up connection -- remember dial up? Ah, the sweet cacophony of electronic noises that was the orchestra of early Internet!

What was crazy at the time is that if you had to go beyond dial up, and opt for a leased line, you really had to break the bank to be able to afford it. For a measly 128 kbps connection, a leased line for home use would set you back by over Rs 83,000 per month, paid annually at a flat price of Rs 10 lakh! You'd think who in their right minds would pay so much money to access the Internet at such agonizingly slow speeds? But there were a lot of takers for VSNL back then.

As many as 10,000 users signed up for VSNL's internet service in the first six months after its August 1995 launch

Also FUP worked slightly differently back then. Instead of putting cap on maximum data per month, which is the norm among ISPs now, VSNL data packs came with an hour limit for dial up users. As advertised in the card above, the 9.6 kbps dial up Internet connection would only allow 250 hours of Internet access for a full year at a price of Rs 15,000.

Ah, those were the days. Things have obviously moved on, and data prices have plummeted to record lows in India, thanks to Jio shaking things up, but VSNL still holds fond memories for anyone who remembers pre-broadband Internet days of India.

Addicted To Your Smartphone? Here’s How You Can Also Make It Your Personal Style Accessory Like Deepika Padukone Does,"PARTNER

Nowadays, almost all of us are simply hooked to our smartphones 24x7! We practically depend on it for everything- from being in touch with loved ones and capturing memories, our smartphone is the need of the hour. When a gadget gets so important, it literally becomes an essential accessory! Just how we take special care in dressing up smartly every day, what if we say that you can make your smartphone a fashion accessory too? Well, Bollywood fashion icon Deepika Padukone does believe so! So let’s learn a few lessons from Deepika on how your smartphone can be your personal style accessory (or let’s say personal style assistant). She did that with her phone, here’s how you can too:

The I-Can’t-Do-Without-It Style Accessory!

Take your fashionista dreams to a higher level by accessorizing your smartphone with your dress.

Pinterest

Yes, accessories are super-important when it comes to grooming. Be it bags, earrings, scarves or even your dearest smartphone. Mix and match it up in a way that it accentuates your stylish avatar. Deepika carries her new Rose Gold phone this season, because this colour is fashionable and chic yet classy and elegant! Rose Gold is an everlasting style color, and would never go out of fashion. So, if you need to pick a colour for your phone, choose something as eternal as Rose Gold.

Avoid clothes that steal the attention off your face, but rather try ones that highlight it in your pictures.

Pinterest

Make it a point to wear clothes which have just the right amount of glamour, for the right occasions! Avoid blaring stripes, zig-zags or eccentric designs! And why is that so important here? Because, if you have that phone in your hand, you are bound to click a ton of pictures (and selfies, of course), so go for solid colors instead. This will keep the focus on your flawless face and expressions. Because as far as being stylish is concerned, your selfie-camera would be more concerned than you are!

Style Yourself & Click!

Choose your favorite pose and click.

Instagram

If you love clicking pictures and selfies, you got to have your significant pose too (probably a side pose that shows your pretty dimples!). Deepika loves clicking side poses with her Selfie Expert which has a 16MP selfie camera (because she clicks the volume button to click, and of course since a center-faced selfie makes your face usually look huge).

Click selfies with a lot of people around. They make you feel happier and prettier.

Twitter

Somehow group selfies are awesome, especially when it’s with people who love you to the core. There are a whole bunch of smiles, and when you are all dressed in your best, it’s got to be awesome. Deepika swears by this too, since most of the times she clicks group selfies with her adoring fans.

Portray You as You!

Let your all-purpose phone speak out your personality and define you as a person.

OPPO F3

Afterall, this gadget is literally close to your heart at all times. From the external design to the internal configuration, it’s got to describe you in a second to an unknown person passing by. Whether you are an hard-core techie or a fashionista like Deepika, your phone should be able to portray you in the right light.

Customize it to speak out your mind.

OPPO F3

Since outward appearances speak out louder, customize the exterior according to what’s on your mind. Bedazzle it, hard-case it or if you don’t vouch for it, you can customize the interior too! Deepika has customized her Rose Gold OPPO F3, which has been launched as #F3DeepikaEdition.

She has designed her own icon with OPPO, that’s etched on the back of the phone. The icon has a shape of letter D and also a letter P inside. Letter D and P together represent Deepika Padukone. Even her signature is embedded on it. Sweet isn’t? The unique Rose Gold OPPO F3 Selfie Expert features a dual front camera – one for Selfie, one for group selfie. A 16-megapixel selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for group selfie.

"Assam Flood Death Toll Rises To 102, As 3192 Villages Go Underwater Affecting 32 Lakh People","The devastation caused by Assam Floods this year is causing more fatalities each day. And there's no end in sight for the continued damage and destruction!

On Monday, the deadly floods claimed three more lives, taking the total count to 102. The flood, so far, has hit people in 25 districts, besides snapping rail connectivity to the Northeast.

On Monday, two people died in Morigaon and one in Golaghat.

With the three fatalities, the deaths in the second wave of floods in the state has gone up to 18, while the overall figure for this year's flood related incidents climbed to 102, including eight in Guwahati, Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) report said on Monday.

A total of 3,192 villages are under water and 1.79 lakh hectares of crop area have been damaged, according to the report.

"Mission possible: A new India: PM is using India’s high-quality, low-cost technology to lift 400 million out of poverty by 2022","On 15 February this year, Isro placed 104 satellites into orbit using only a single launch of one vehicle, PSLV-C37. The video of the event, available easily enough on the net, shows the familiar zoom of a rocket entering space, and then little flicks chase one another into the deep distance until the mission is completed. Only three satellites were Indian; 96 were commissioned by two American companies, Planet Laks and Spire Global.

The acceleration in space, impressive as it is, might be less spectacular than the change taking place on the ground. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has initiated a transformation towards a new India in which historic burdens such as poverty and corruption have been eliminated, and inheritance ills like communalism and casteism are only bad memory. His mission has a calendar; the deadline is 2022, when India celebrates its 75th year of independence.

Transformative change needs radical thinking. The economic empowerment of women is being used as a principal cure for poverty. Under Mudra, the PM’s signature project for those at the base of the economic pyramid, loans worth Rs 3,55,590 crore have been disbursed. Remarkably, 78% of those taking these loans are women.

The PM’s housing plan, for the impoverished, is an equally big story in gender emancipation. A woman can take this home loan as sole owner; but a man needs a woman as co-owner unless he is a widower or bachelor. This is a fundamental shift in the balance of power within a family. Over 25 million women who thought that a gas cylinder was a privilege of the middle class or rich, are now in smokeless kitchens. Swachh Bharat is a means to dignity and better health for women. The list is long.

The objective is to lift about 400 million out of harsh poverty in five years by ensuring that the first fruits and largest share of economic growth go to those who need it most. In a complementary initiative, the PM is using India’s proven capability in high-quality, low-cost technology to create efficient, sustainable and corruption-free delivery systems for direct benefits to the poor on an unprecedented scale.

Jan Dhan was an essential first step. In 2015, within three months, banks opened 300 million accounts for those who had never crossed the doors of a bank before. Critics sneered that these were “cashless”. Unsurprisingly, they had missed the point: banks were now serving those without money, rather than those with.

Use of technology for transparency has also become mandatory in the bidding process for government contracts. In a country where, particularly during the long decade between 2004 and 2014, contracts became synonymous with corruption, the change is a virtual revolution, leaving sections of the old political-industrial complex frustrated, angry and desperate to restore the previous order.

New India is being fashioned from embers of the old. Sceptics who cannot fathom why Narendra Modi has become the most popular PM in memory need look no further than his comprehensive assault on poverty and corruption.

It surely cannot be anyone’s case that through some twirl of a magic wand, India should suddenly become free of all ills. Among our difficult legacies is the politics of Hindu-Muslim differences, a tragedy that has simmered and often bubbled into conflict. One long-standing dispute has been over the cow, held sacred in Hinduism. Mahatma Gandhi urged an end to cow slaughter; and the lead architect of our Constitution, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, included this as a guiding tenet of our Constitution. Beef was banned in most states by Congress governments.

Of late, cow vigilantes have attacked Muslims and Dalits on suspicion of eating or transporting beef. Two incidents attracted wide, and understandable, media coverage: of Pehlu Khan in Rajasthan and Junaid in Haryana.

No government can prevent crime. A government’s bona fides are tested by what it does in pursuit of the criminal. In Rajasthan, seven suspects have been charged with murder. The state’s chief minister Vasundhara Raje has dismissed as malicious the allegation that her administration was biased and argued the same in this newspaper, in an oped piece headlined ‘Mob violence is unacceptable’ (27 July). Comparisons are not an answer, but she pointed out that murders and mob violence took a higher tally in Rajasthan in 2012, when Congress was in power. In Haryana, five were arrested but the main suspect escaped. Police traced him to Sakri, in Maharashtra, where he thought he had found safety in obscurity. He has now confessed to stabbing Junaid.

On 29 June, PM Modi expressed his anguish during the centenary event of Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat, wondering how much pain Gandhi himself would have felt. Gandhi had offered to die for the cow, but never advocated violence in its name. Finance minister Arun Jaitley has described the incidents as barbaric.

Both voters and politicians are increasingly dismissive of the motivated and fraying narrative of extended guilt. Nitish Kumar, for instance, refused to buy this false propaganda of Congress, whose only electoral crutch now is the alleged insecurity of minorities.

In 2013, there was an assassination attempt on Narendra Modi during a rally in Patna. At that critical, volatile moment, he said that Hindus and Muslims had a choice: they could either fight each other, or they could unite to fight the true enemy, poverty. Fraternity and prosperity of all Indians is the only creed of Narendra Modi."

Increasing gulf in quality defines current health of Asian giants,"Sri Lanka will have to improve massively in order to challenge India later this year. © AFP

Purely as a game, I sometimes try to do the old six word review of things. I attempted it for the series against Sri Lanka and came up with: Sri Lanka abysmal, India intimidating. It told me everything about the series and I had a word left! The home team was that bad.

Admittedly, India began overwhelming favourites but teams have visited the lovely island as favourites before and discovered opposition they sometimes hadn't anticipated. There were always, certainly in the last fifteen years, players who could take the game away from you. There were tough players, others with an air of mystery around them, some who played exotic shots and bowled at unique angles. This time there were none. It is not good for cricket because Sri Lanka has given us some very fine talents who inevitably resided within modest personalities.

It is easy therefore to belittle India's performance but that wouldn't be fair. You play the opposition you are provided and if there is a gulf between the two teams in ability, you make sure that is reflected in the scorecards. And sure it was. Each time, India racked up a lead in excess of 300, the margins of victory were the kind you would expect if a heavyweight boxer entered the ring with a middleweight. To that extent, India did what they could and while playing an opponent who hardly throws a punch back can lead to bad habits, India dominated like the better side is meant to.

Shikhar Dhawan made the most of the opportunity as did Cheteshwar Pujara. One punched with a smile, the other made incisions with narrowed eyes. And all the batsmen partook of the feast on offer. Ravichandran Ashwin picked up 17 wickets and scored runs fluently and until a headmasterly approach to the game took out Ravindra Jadeja, he had fun too. And if Hardik Pandya had been asked to choose a debut series, he couldn't have picked a better one. There is something about him and I hope it stays that way as fame envelops him. If you like fame too much it isn't your best companion as doubtlessly he will be told by wise heads. Kuldeep Yadav impressed too and the fact that batsmen don't seem to pick him means captains will always be tempted to pick him. India will have some tough choices to make in the days ahead.

If you are a cricket lover, it is difficult not to be carried away by the manner in which the ball leaves Mohammed Shami's hands and makes its journey to the batsman. The seam is upright and proud and the ball reaches the bat at a nippy pace. Shami probably bowled too little and admitted in an interview that he was the support bowler in these conditions. That may be understating things but I do hope he thinks he is Ashwin when the side tours more seam-friendly lands.

But for all that, the most dramatic performance for me came from a quiet man whose deeds even modern scoreboards haven't found ways to reflect. Wriddhiman Saha's wicket-keeping in the second Test was the performance of the series for me.

Sri Lanka come to India this winter and I hope they have more to offer. Karunaratne, Mendis, Mathews and Chandimal are far better players than they let themselves be at most times but it is the bowling they need to sort. Sandakan must play everytime but how do they replace Herath? I wish they can cajole a few more months out of fingers that have twirled so long because otherwise their batsmen will always have a mountain of runs in front of them.

The one-dayers will be more competitive but I'm afraid Test cricket needs to come to grips with the crisis that confronts it. Nobody came to watch and when one team looks like a juggernaut and the other a meek figure waiting to be run over, it doesn't bode well.

Chawla joins Ranji champions Gujarat for 2017-18 season

Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 06:50 PM

""As a player, I thought this was the right time to make a move"" - Chawla © Getty

Piyush Chawla has ended his long-term association with Uttar Pradesh cricket in order to represent Gujarat in the upcoming first-class season, the legspinner confirmed to Sportstar. ""As a player, I thought this was the right time to make a move,"" Chawla said on Wednesday (August 16).

Chawla, who picked up 226 wickets in 80 first-class matches for UP over a period of almost 12 years, will now bolster the defending champions' bowling line-up which already consists the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel and RP Singh, who also made the same move two years ago. It is to be noted that Chawla featured in only two Ranji games last season after getting sidelined for a major period with an injury.

The 28-year-old made his Test debut for India way back in 2006 but has since then managed to add only two more caps with his last appearance in the format coming almost five years back. With the BCCI reverting to the home-away format for the Ranji this season, the legspinner has observed the lack of help for spinners from the surfaces in UP as the main reason behind his move. ""The kind of wickets you get in the Western region which has a red soil layering help the spinners better,"" Chawla pointed out.

""When I play in Uttar Pradesh, the wickets are either seaming tracks or flat ones. That's how the weather is. So, it was time to make a move to a state where I can bowl much better and get wickets.""

Gujarat skipper Parthiv Patel had a role to play in the move, according to Chawla's own admission. ""A couple of years ago, when UP toured Gujarat for a match, I saw the wicket was a turner, and it was helping the spinners,"" he recalled. ""So I had told Parthiv, 'If I ever think of making a move, please keep your options open for me.'

""Last year, I only played a couple of matches for UP as I was injured. I couldn't play much, and only participated in one-dayers and T20s, because in the second game of the Ranji Trophy itself, I was injured. So, this year I was mulling a change. I spoke to Parthiv and told him about my plans. He and the officials at the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) were happy with the move. I am thankful to them that they welcomed me,"" he added.

"This Woman Was Born Without A Vagina, But Is Now Fundraising To Raise Money For A Surgery So She Can Have A Normal Sex Life","Kaylee Moats was only 18 when she realised that she had not received her period yet. The doctor ran her through an MRI revealed that she didn't have a uterus, cervix, vagina or vaginal opening, according to GoFundMe page that her sister created to fundraise for her surgery. Her vagina looks normal but the opening is replaced by dimpled skin instead of a hole with parts missing on the inside.

mirror.co.uk

Moats, who is now 22, was diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-Hauser syndrome—a condition that causes the uterus and vagina to be underdeveloped or absent, according to the National Institutes of Health. The condition is so rare that it only affects 1 in 4,500 girls and its cause is still unknown.

Obviously, Moats was in for quite a shock initially. ""I was heartbroken and confused when the doctor came in and told me he didn't see a uterus in the ultrasound. I was scared for the future because I didn't know what's coming up next and how I would be able to have my own family one-day,“ states Kaylee according to report in the Mirror UK.

""I did my own research and realised I have type one, which is the dimpled skin. I do sometimes have a sharp pain in my ovaries. I still ovulate like any other woman it just gets dissolved into my ovaries instead of being released,"" adds Kaylee.

“This diagnosis raises a lot of fears, concerns, and insecurities in Kaylee about her identity and her future. The options of surrogacy and adoption give her some hope but she will never be able to carry her own children. The dreams we had of raising families together are going to look a little different than we had initially planned, stated The GoFundMe page.”

gofundme.com

Her only respite is the possibility of having a normal sex-life if her surgery goes off as planned. She needs $15,000 for the surgery and the crowd-funding page set up by her sister has already managed to raise $5,720 dollars in two months, according to New York Post.

Her boyfriend who’s been with her for the last 4 months, Robbie Limmer, says that he is not really bothered about having a sexual relationship but has been putting aside $50 every month to help fund Moats’s surgery.





“He doesn't really focus on the sexual side of our relationship because we can't do anything since I don't have a vaginal opening. But I am looking forward to having a sexual relationship. I'm not sure If I want to wait until marriage but I think having that option there is a lot more comforting,” Moats tells Daily Mail UK.

instagom.com

“I'm a bit nervous to have sex for the first time after surgery because I'm not sure if something is going to go wrong down there or if it's going to hurt,” adds Moats. Let’s hope for her sake the surgery goes off as planned and she is able to live a normal life and a fulfilling sex life like any other girl.

Government must develop its ‘human capital’ akin to private sector,"By M Muneer

Rajiv Gandhi had famously stunned the nation when he said that only 15 paise of every rupee earmarked for the poor actually reach them. With Aadhaar and digitisation, things may have ameliorated, but no one knows for sure. Imagine the possibilities if 100% reach the final beneficiary. Here’s another one for the imagination: you walk into a sarkari office with dread for a certificate and get treated as if you’re in a luxury car showroom. Every government servant you encounter truly service-oriented? Far-fetched?

Not necessarily. It is plausible if GoI develops its human capital akin to the private sector, and aligns it to the vision and mission. Government must invest in constituting ‘government capital’ (GC): a bundle of intangible assets that includes human capital, information capital (such as the Aadhaar, PAN and other systems), leadership capital, innovation and education ecosystems, the Centre and state brands, culture of meritocracy and fairness, execution capabilities and so on.

To do this, the government folks — including the policymakers — must get trained and skilled. Almost all the intangible assets that form GC will be driven by one: human capital. Yet, government hardly thinks about building and growing this most critical capital. Bureaucrats elbow their way through to be sent to the best universities across the world for additional training. But training must be contextual to the policies of the elected governments for it to derive value.

Worse, the training of the-less-than-1,700 IAS officers at Ivy Leagues at huge costs has poor returns on investment since most of them use it for personal benefits. This amount could have been better utilised had there been training for other employees for such normal things as communication, citizen-centricity, service quality, productivity, risk-taking, leadership, etc. How many Harvardtrained bureaucrats resort to training their subordinates? Productivity suffers from there itself with topdown communication and no twoway discussions.

Historically, countries with large GC have succeeded in creating far bigger per-capita GDP growth. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela have high natural resources, but made poor investments in their people and systems, creating far less output per person and experiencing much slower growth rates than countries like Singapore, Israel and South Korea, which have few natural resources but invested heavily in human and other capital. GC creates value at both macro and micro economic levels.

GoI instituted the Skill India programme based on an OECD report arguing for developing countries to build their skilled labour for economic progress. The fact that India was way behind — at 10% skilled human capital in comparison to the 50-92% of developed nations — prompted GoI to drive Skill India without applying further thought. The report didn’t specify that the skilling should begin at home, and that it is very much the government’s business to skill its employees.

Had that happened first, the Skill India mission would have delivered wonders. Currently, it is a breeding ground for profiteering and nepotism.

This is also a classic case of over dependence on external consultants when one’s own employees have irrelevant skills. A bureaucracy driven by rules and regulations will always float a tender and use the consultant to mandate everything else. If developed well, government employees would be the torchbearers in driving ecosystems so needed for the future of job-creation, innovation, education and just about everything else.

Exactly how many people are employed in government? According to the Seventh Pay Commission, no one really knows! And how about productivity? There is no data on this either, but it is much lower than in the developed world and certainly dismally lower than in the private sector.

With the global economy looking bleak, government will have to stick to an austerity drive and get its employees to do more with less, and differently.

It should get employees to ‘own’ its many initiatives. Also, urgently needed is a system to develop the capability and capacity to redesign GoI’s service, become ‘human capital architects’ by providing evidence-based, innovative thinking. This should include emboldening and expediting fraternisation, co-designing across public services, and creating enabling frameworks.

If the human capital is aligned to the mission, significant outcomes can be triggered. And with equitable natural resources and intangible assets, India could leapfrog on growth rates if action is taken quickly today.

Manga Wisdom: Advice for the times from Japanese anime Naruto,"In yet another life lesson from my favourite Japanese anime series ‘Naruto’, a character named Jiraiya says that one should make an effort to talk to others every day. Even if it is small talk, such communication is important to unburden oneself and form bonds of camaraderie and friendship. Otherwise, keeping quiet leads the heart to become sullen and dark – in other words a route to depression and hate.



Of course, there are times that one does need to be quiet, for example during meditation and prayer to introspect and reflect on things. However, one should guard against the feeling of not wanting to talk. For, once a person gives into this feeling, he soon goes down the slippery slope of depression. Human beings are social creatures. We need to communicate with each other. However, unfortunately, we are living in times where the individual is becoming increasingly isolated. We have surrounded ourselves with technology and have access to information like never before. We have social media at our fingertips. But none of these things can actually replace human face-to-face communication.

It’s a tragedy that in many parts of the developed world – and now even in sections of India – we have a situation where people don’t know their neighbours. Such lack of social interactions is bad for mental health and society as a whole. Sure, a modern lifestyle has empowered the individual, placing individual rights over the community. But social interactions are vital to protect a society from nefarious forces. When individuals become isolated and depressed, they live in darkness. And that darkness can be manipulated by criminal and unscrupulous elements. For, these elements pretend to befriend an isolated, depressed individual and offer him a chance at salvation.

A classic example of this is the online radicalisation of individuals by terror groups such as the Islamic State (IS). Various cases have revealed that IS possesses sophisticated online cells to identify potential recruits, indoctrinate them in radical ideology, and fully convert them into jihadi footsoldiers. True, IS as an organisation has been on the wane in recent months. But its template of online radicalisation can be copied by other terror groups. And the target of such online radicalisation is usually the isolated, confused individual whose tribe has only increased in recent times.

So let us make it a point to engage in human conversation every day. It’s good for the health of both individuals and society. Let’s make a conscious effort not to recede into an Information Technology cocoon – more information at our fingertips doesn’t necessarily mean more quality human interactions. Technology is great, but we must not become slaves to it. Otherwise, it will be easy for unscrupulous forces to take advantage of us.

That said, I continue to be amazed by the ability of Japanese anime and manga to portray relevant philosophical, socio-cultural and political concepts. In that sense, the medium is more than just art and can provide incisive, as well as subtle, commentary on important issues, trends and happenings. Given these facts, I believe that Japanese manga and anime can be adapted to tell Indian stories as well. And such productions can become a source of both education and fun."

"Hello, period leave: But who decided that it would be the first day and not the second or the sixth? 😜","So some employers are experimenting with period leave where female employees get the day off on the first day of their period and for once both the feminists and sexists aren’t exactly sure how to react. Sadly i no longer work in an office and as a matter of fact no longer have my period either, menopause having taken root earlier than later. But at 44 years of age i know i could have faked it because seriously who in the office is in charge of checking? Who got that job i wonder.

And by the way who decided that it would be the first day and not the second or in the case of some of my friends the sixth? Yes, some women do have it longer and rougher than others. Not me, my body gave me things i loathe like cellulite and varicose veins yes, but it also gave me a four-day, pain-free ride for which i will be eternally grateful. I was one of the lucky ones who was always surprised to see my period having had zero warning. Some women on the other hand got the Holy Trinity – bloating, cramping and vicious mood-swings. It’s no joke and if you are that guy at work going she must be PMSing yaar you are literally an idiot whose mother and father did an abysmal job raising you.

A woman’s body really is a wonderland – thanks John Mayer – and we have been living with this wonderland since the dawn of time. For every woman who had an easy pregnancy there is one who endured bed-rest the entire time. For every woman who went into labour in the conference room and completed a major merger before crowning (look it up lads) there is the woman who spent over 18 hours in excruciating pain. And finally for every woman who thanks to a feminist husband bounced right back to work there is the one forced to stay home with the baby because she has a rubbish husband who makes silly jokes at the office about other women’s PMS.

Should women have period leave? Should they have better maternity benefits? Can they come home at midnight without being stalked or raped? These are the questions that plague modern India and so before answering them let’s consider this: Women do not need sympathy and we certainly do not deserve scorn, what we need is what every living being deserves – empathy. And yes, you can look that up too."
Punjab’s water stress foregrounds tough policy trade-offs,"A reply by Water Resources minister Uma Bharti to a Lok Sabha question on groundwater depletion foregrounds tough trade-offs facing India’s policymakers.

According to Bharti, an assessment of groundwater resources and usage showed that 16% of 6,584 assessment units in India are “overexploited.”

A table which accompanies her reply provides state-wise data. Here, Punjab stands out for the magnitude of overexploitation. If 16% of assessed units in India are overexploited, the figure rises to 76% in case of Punjab. It is the most water stressed Indian state.

Punjab also happens to be India’s most important state in providing food security. It is a massive contributor to the cereal-dependent public distribution system.

One way of looking at it is India’s food security is heavily dependent on a state which is perhaps the worst placed in terms of water stress. Punjab’s impressive agricultural production is partly an outcome of its irrigation coverage. About 98.5% of Punjab’s crop area is irrigated, mainly on account of groundwater irrigation. Without this supply of water, Punjab will surely not be a large contributor to rice procurement by state agencies.

It is not just quantity where Punjab’s farmers score. According to Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices, Punjab has the highest yield in paddy among states.

This is where a policy maker will face difficult trade-offs.

The easy solution will be to dramatically bring down electricity subsidies which will force farmers to divert to a crop which consumes less water than paddy. While this process takes place, how is it possible to guarantee that other states will offset the loss of rice procurement in Punjab?

Without a simultaneous offset in rice procurement, there will be other complications such as a revival of cereal inflation. Introducing a rational pricing policy to preserve groundwater is essential. But the sequence of steps needed to get there without collateral damage is very difficult."
Call for change: PM’s I-Day speech certainly had a sense of the occasion but was short on specifics,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi can meld a sense of history with a sense of language to deliver evocative and inspiring speeches, and those qualities were on full display when he spoke from Red Fort’s ramparts yesterday. Thus, according to him, the 1942 slogan of “Bharat Chhodo” (Quit India) should now be amended to “Bharat Jodo” (Join India). If currently we have a “chalta hai” (everything goes) attitude that should be replaced by “badal sakta hai” (everything can change). Kashmir’s problems cannot be solved by “gaali” (abuse) or “goli” (bullets) but by “gale lagaana” (embracing).

The latter is a significant overture as it suggests that while bullets or stones will not change anything, should there be a mindset shift or the emergence of new leadership in Kashmir, the Centre is listening and willing to reciprocate. Only after good will has been established can specific initiatives come to fruition, a point missed by those who fault the government for not coming up with specific initiatives in this regard. Whatever the dispute is – whether in Kashmir or anywhere else – it can be settled in a spirit of non-violence and within the framework of India’s democratic institutions, and Modi’s speech did well to emphasise this. Couched in sobriety and a sense of the occasion as it was, however, it fell short of specificity on other issues.

Most prominent among these is the critical issue of jobs for India’s burgeoning youth population where the best the PM could suggest is that youth should be trained to become their own employers. But India ranks poorly in terms of ease of doing business, which means big businesses can still survive but small entrepreneurs find it tough to cope. Modi emphasised project implementation, but this in itself won’t suffice if the business environment doesn’t improve.

Modi also promised to double farm income by 2022, but didn’t offered much by way of a roadmap to get there. He mentioned the Gorakhpur tragedy in connection with natural disasters. But Gorakhpur is one area where his dictum of “badal sakta hai” can be applied – child deaths in India are shockingly high and most other countries, including neighbouring Bangladesh, do much better. Speaking of project implementation, while physical infrastructure such as roads and ports are certainly needed if “new India” is to dawn, perhaps even more necessary are public health projects which save the lives of children."
Here's How A 3D Printer With Robot Arms Will Go To Space To Build What We Need There By Itself,"When we need a space station upgraded, or a satellite repaired or a Moon outpost built, it’s up to astronauts to get the job done. Or worse, launch it into space from rockets on Earth.

Now, a private company is planning to change that letting a 3D-printing bot manufacture and build whatever hardware we need in space.

The Archinaut, depicted assembling a satellite array larger than itself - Made in Space

Astronauts need a suit to survive in the vacuum of space, but that’s not all. They also need to rest and take an occasional pitstop to resupply their oxygen. Made in Space instead has now shown off a device that can 3D print parts in a thermal vacuum, similar to what it would experience in space.

Part of the company’s Archinaut program, the development is another step in their efforts to eventually launch a 3D printer into space, once that has robot arms. This way the bot could not only custom manufacture the parts it needs, but also place them itself as and when required.

The large difference here is that Made in Space’s 3D printer, called the Extended Structure Additive Manufacturing Machine, has a thermally insulated case, similar to the parts that protect the electronics on a satellite. “Our tactic has been, let's control the environment that's inside the printer, because we can't do anything about what's outside,” Archinaut project manager Eric Joyce told Wired.

The advantages are enormous, as the Archinaut could build hardware much larger than would be possible on Earth. If you build a giant satellite on the ground, you need to have a rocket capable of lifting it, and the money to spend on the fuel. But if you’re manufacturing plant is already in space, you can build a satellite or telescope of massive proportions. And without gravity, there’s no fear of 3D printed parts not being able to take the structure’s weight.

NASA has already recognised the potential here, with Made in Space operating under a two-year $20 million contract with the space agency. The company has already been experimenting with 3D printing on board the space station, and its next task will be to add the arms to the printer."

Is the Hindu a victim? No. Hindus feel safe and the victim narrative is a manufactured war cry,"The targeting of Amarnath Yatris in Anantnag has sparked off a familiar narrative: Hindus are victims in their own land. According to this shopworn line, Hindus suffer in silence while attacks on Muslims are highlighted. From Paris to Manchester, every time Islamist terror strikes a western city, it is used to put the entire Muslim community in India on notice, even though as George Bush famously said, “India is a country which does not have a single al-Qaida member in a population of 150 million Muslims.” The Hindu victimhood narrative which is nothing but an Islamophobic war cry against minorities, needs to be busted.

Yes, those who died in Anantnag were innocent Hindu pilgrims. Yes, their killers may have been motivated by a radicalised Islam that spurs violence. But is that enough reason to spin a comprehensive story of Hindus at the mercy of a pincer attack from Islamic zealots and liberal “Hindu haters”? Such an imagined attack is not only dangerous fantasy but also deliberate strategy to create a fear psychosis when in fact the Hindu experiences no fear from minorities and is perfectly safe and free to practice his religion in whichever manner he wants. Deliberately manufactured “insults” like Dhoni as Krishna on a magazine cover or whipped up rage over a few seconds of azaan or imagined slights to Hinduism in books and movies are only means to keep the pot boiling and politicise both religion and society.

Islamophobia reigns supreme, making Hindutva a mimic of extremist Islam. The fixation on the Islamic threat has meant that there are politicised Hindus now agitating for blasphemy laws, public punishment of crimes, some even issuing fatwas. Islamophobia is also growing because of perceptions of “appeasement” of Muslims and a selective application of laws. But the special privileges sometimes granted to orthodox maulanas by short-sighted “secular” politicians cannot now be used to demand appeasement of radical Hindutva forces who are claiming total immunity from the law.

The fact is Muslims are the worst victims of terrorism. In 2011 BBC reported 82-97% of terrorism-related fatalities over the last five years were Muslims, the Shia-Sunni conflict has resulted in the Muslim brotherhood turning on itself and in Kashmir the overwhelming majority of the thousands killed in militancy have been Muslims. So who’s the victim here? Images of Muslim groups targeting Hindu shops in Bengal’s Basirhat are troubling, but equally nasty and sinister are the fake photographs being circulated on social media designed to push a strategic campaign that Bengal has become a hub of hatred for Hindus.

Are Hindus victims in Bengal? No, they certainly are not, which is why the fake photos on social media found no resonance among the citizenry which palpably experiences no fear of Muslims. In fact, across India the Hindu experiences no fear at all from the Muslim, however relentlessly “love jihad” campaigns are pushed by Hindutva foot soldiers. The exodus of Kashmiri Pandits was a terrible blot on Kashmir, and exposes the failures of successive governments in Srinagar. But is that reason enough to claim Hindus are under threat across the country?

The Sachar Committee report showed horrifyingly low levels of education and healthcare among Muslims, falling rate of Muslim representation in bureaucracy and police, female literacy lower than SCs and STs; it showed only one out of 25 students in undergraduate colleges and one in 50 in post graduate colleges are Muslims. If the community was “pampered” and “appeased” why doesn’t this show in rising incomes and education? Or are we confusing the political patronage of imams with the average Indian Muslim?

The pernicious whisper campaign that Muslims are reproducing faster than Hindus and will soon outnumber the majority is a myth as shown by the website India Spend, which reveals through figures that fertility rates are higher among poorer communities, both Hindu and Muslim, and are not based on religion. The Left and RSS outfits murdering each other in Kerala are comprised of Hindus on both sides. In fact whether it is the murders of Junaid, gau rakshaks lynching Pehlu Khan, the attack on a Muslim family in a train, or the slapping of sedition charges on those setting off crackers after an India-Pakistan cricket match, the reality is that it is Muslims who are the true victims of the narrative of muscular ‘nationalism’.

By contrast, who or what is victimising Hindus? Who is oppressing Hindus? At a time when Muslim political representation is at an all time low, why should Hindus feel under attack? When Hindu mythology, festivals, iconography, imagery is now the dominant culture in art, books, movies and TV shows, when a government that openly declares that it is a Hindu nationalist government rules with a big majority, why on earth should the Hindu feel as if he is cornered?

Of course, a morally bankrupt Muslim leadership has not helped the Muslim cause. Instead they have created and nurtured a grievance industry for votes and not taken steps to reduce the sense of Muslim separateness. Luckily, in spite of myopic political leaders, bridge builders still exist and many are toiling to maintain inter-community bridges even as the Sangh is determined to blow them up. Radical Hindus are insisting on victimhood, but the real victims of today – the farmer facing debt or the IT engineer facing job loss – are neither Hindus or Muslims, only citizens. The Hindu right should realise that a campaign based on creating fear may bring electoral benefits once, but will not work in the long run, because as far as his religion is concerned, the Hindu feels safe and unthreatened."

Windies keen to spring surprise in England's maiden day-night Test,"WINDIES TOUR OF ENGLAND, 2017

Windies keen to spring surprise in England's maiden day-night Test

Rob Johnston • Last updated on Wed, 16 Aug, 2017, 06:50 PM

On the face of it, a Test series between England, ranked third in the world, and Windies, ranked ninth, runs the risk of being horribly one-sided yet there is hope that the three-match series will be closer than the rankings suggest. With England still having a number of issues to resolve, notably with their batting line-up, and the tourists a talented and improving, if still raw around the edges, team, this is unlikely to be the walk in the park that many are expecting for the home side.

The first Test of the series being a day-night match levels the playing field somewhat, too. Windies have experienced a day-night Test already, against Pakistan in Dubai, and had a good workout against Derbyshire last week in a three-day day-night game. In contrast, England have had just one training session under lights this week in Birmingham and none of their players have had much exposure to the pink ball in their careers. Stuart Broad admitted earlier this week that it will be ""leap in to the unknown"" for England.

Given the right conditions and if the pink ball makes batting troublesome during the twilight period, the useful Windies pace attack could cause problems for England's batting line-up. Surrey's Mark Stoneman will become the 12th opener to be tried since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012 and Tom Westley and Dawid Malan, if selected, have plenty to prove too. In Shannon Gabriel, Kemar Roach, captain Jason Holder and Alzarri Joseph, Windies' attack has bowlers who have pace, who can keep things tight and who can swing the ball. They should not be underestimated.

The Windies batting line-up looked in decent touch against Derbyshire last week although the county's attack was by no means strong. There were hundreds for Kyle Hope, Shai Hope and Roston Chase, as well as 92 for Kieran Powell but the batting remains the tourists' weaker suit. Much will depend on vice-captain Kraigg Braithwaite being able to blunt James Anderson and Broad and the Windies middle order, including Chase, who has scored three hundreds in his ten Tests so far, and the talented Jermaine Blackwood, being able to score consistently. There is talent aplenty but questions remain about their Test match discipline.

Given the inexperience of Windies' batsmen, England's in-form bowlers will fancy their chances of making inroads as they were able to against South Africa. Anderson was quite magnificent against the Proteas and Broad looked his hostile best in the final Test at Old Trafford. Moeen Ali's 25 wickets in that series confirmed his recent improvement with the ball and with Chris Woakes back fit and Toby Roland-Jones looking the part against South Africa, England have all bases covered.

But despite the improving nature of this Windies team, they have not won a Test series since 2014 and their last away series victory was in 2012. It would be a considerable upset were they to beat England over the next month but the men from the Caribbean should not be underestimated either. This series should prove a useful test for England ahead of the winter's Ashes.

When: Thursday, August 17, 2017, 2 PM.

Where: Edgbaston Cricket Ground, Birmingham

What to expect: The Edgbaston groundsman has not been given any instructions to leave extra grass on the surface to help keep the pink ball shiny, so it is likely to be a good, true surface for batting with some pace and bounce for the bowlers. As the game wears on, it may spin. The weather forecast is mixed with rain forecast on Friday and Sunday but decent weather on the other days.

Team News:

England

The hosts have opted to hand Stoneman his maiden Test cap and he will slot in to replace Keaton Jennings, who has been in wretched form in recent times, having scored just 127 runs in the recently-concluded four-match Test series against South Africa. Also, England resisted the temptation to play Chris Woakes, who is back fit after a side strain and there is no spot for legspinner Mason Crane as yet.

Playing XI: Alastair Cook, Mark Stoneman, Tom Westley, Joe Root (c), David Malan, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Moeen Ali, Toby Roland-Jones, Stuart Broad, James Anderson.

Windies

Windies must decide whether to play legspinner Devendra Bishoo or go in with a four-man seam attack as they did against Derbyshire. Given the likely good nature of the surface, Bishoo, who averages 37 in Tests, may get the nod which would mean 20-year-old quick Alzarri missing out. Shannon Gabriel, much improved over the last year, will lead the attack with Roach who would be playing his first Test since January 2016.

Team (from): Jason Holder(c), Kraigg Brathwaite, Devendra Bishoo, Jermaine Blackwood, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich, Shannon Gabriel, Shimron Hetmyer, Kyle Hope, Shai Hope, Alzarri Joseph, Kieran Powell, Raymon Reifer, Kemar Roach.

Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech: farmers still waiting for achhe din,"Listening to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on Independence Day when he spoke at length about welfare of farmers gave one a feeling of déjà vu. It was almost as if one was transported to early 2014 when the Lok Sabha election campaign was in full swing. During that entire campaign, Modi had made it a point to reiterate his commitment towards welfare of farmers. Three years later Modi has ushered GST and demonetisation which has changed the basic fundamentals of Indian economy, but his government’s apathy towards agriculture which constitute 54.6% of India’s total work force remains unchanged.

Consider the speeches before Modi became Prime Minister in which he promised that farmers would make a minimum of 50% profit on their produce. He assured farmers that after taking into account their input cost of seed, water, electricity, fertilizer, medicines, and labour etc., the new dispensation would add a flat 50% over and above it to decide the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of crops. Three years later farmer unrest continues in large parts of the country forcing some state governments to intervene and offer loan-waivers.

The farmers need our support. They have been benefited by the various schemes launched by the government: PM Modihttps://t.co/EJUKnzWeiE pic.twitter.com/jff0gHrlLg — Times of India (@timesofindia) August 15, 2017

In his speech from Red Fort, Modi went on to list his government’s achievements of how the number of farmers covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has gone up from 3.25 crore to 5.75 crore. Even though Modi’s intentions may be to ensure that farmers are covered under some sort of financial security, but it is an uphill task for farmers to avail benefits due to many technicalities of PMFBY rules. This is directly proportionate to the growth of non-life general insurance companies at the expense of farmers. These companies grew at 32% from Rs 96,376 crore in 2015–16 to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in 2016–17 as per reports.

farmers suicide in India: Over 12,000 farmer suicides per year, Centre tells Supreme Court #MyNewIndia https://t.co/pY5mXmI9BU — काकावाणी (@AliSohrab007) August 13, 2017

Rural distress is evident in the significantly high figure of 6867 farm suicides mainly from five states in 2016 as per reports. Comparatively, this is more than half of total figures from five states in 2015 when farmers faced severe drought for the second consecutive year. Even though government has claimed that farmer suicides are declining, the number of reported suicide cases has belied their claim. Modi too has shifted goal posts by promising to double farm income by 2022 – a promise prominently mentioned in BJP’s 2014 manifesto."
Morocco wants travellers find answers to intolerance,"Morocco’s efforts to discuss peace is not exactly making breaking headlines but it is indeed unique and has been lauded by one and all, including policymakers in Washington, Moscow and Beijing, even New Delhi. And there are enough reasons why global diplomats are loving the idea.

Tangiers, the Moroccan port city that once lured American composer Paul Bowles and French writer Jean Genet, is asking new generation travellers and peacemakers to visit the sleepy city this November discuss what would drive peace and mutual tolerance across world.

The second edition of the International Festival of Ibn Battuta, themed on the Moroccan globetrotter who once travelled to India and even worked as a judge for some years, attempts to find answers to some of most difficult questions of modern times revolving around intolerance and religion. Ibn Battuta, whose extraordinary journeys that spanned nearly three decades, himself tried hard to find answers to global strife caused by reasons stretching from religion to race, power to rebellions.

The festival, an unique one, will open up important discussions to understand world history and its changing traditions to the next generation, it will also discuss why growing intolerance is becoming the biggest bane of societies across the world. In some ways, this is Morocco’s international engagement with neighbouring and distant countries, the idea is to understand the world through extensive travels.

Mohammed Dekkak, a senior organiser of the festival, argues why the current global geo-political scenarios highlight an extraordinary connection of Morocco to other nations. He feels Morocco’s open-minded international relations will open up multicultural societies, sustainability, ethics fostering peace and mutual tolerance, all through travel. Dekkak – confident different countries with different races and cultures can still sign a common charter – speaks the mind of Ibn Battuta: Travel is the language of peace, important to drive in meaningful conversations. Dekkak firmly believes every traveller is an ambassador of peace, a citizen of the world.

Conversations will drive the show, there will be business as well.

Some of the world’s most powerful economies have their eyes on Africa and dialogues in and around Africa are gaining popularity across the world. It is happening mainly because of the continent’s wealth like diamonds and oil, besides Africa offers great agrarian opportunities. The festival in Morocco assumes importance because of the country’s highly competitive, emerging economy. Tangier – ironically Ibn Battuta’s hometown – is a melting point between Africa, Europe and the Arab World.

The former Indian vice president, Hamid Ansari, was in Morocco last June, pushing bilateral trade, among the deliverables phosphates used for fertilizer, extremely valuable to agrarian societies such as India. Moroccan phosphate resources are among the most extensive in the world, with only China and the United States reaching similar levels of production. In return for phosphates and other resources, New Delhi is keen to boost Morocco’s automobile and pharma productions.

But at the heart of everything, lie conversations, serious, stimulating conversations. Like the Vienna coffee stores which offer the first cup free so that people accepting the offer start their conversations and then, buy the second cup, the second edition of this unique conference could open up interesting conversations around a subject that has rattled the world for over a decade: Growing intolerance."
