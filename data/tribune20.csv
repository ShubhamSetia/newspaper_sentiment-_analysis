83% metro residents feel life has become more uncertain: Survey,"Mumbai, August 20

A vast majority of people living in metros feel more uncertain about their lives compared to their non-metro peers, says a survey.

Concern over uncertainty is high across the country and has increased in the last four years. As much as 83 per cent of those living in the metros feel more uncertain about their lives compared to 67 per cent in non-metros, it said.

The online survey was conducted by Birla Sun Life Insurance among 1,540 people in the age-group of 15-22 years.

In contrast, 77 per cent of the surveyed metro residents had felt in 2013 that their life had become uncertain, while the figure for non-metros was 68 per cent.

As per the survey, women are more uncertain about their lives compared to men and their worries have increased over the last four years.

Three major categories of uncertainties are self and family; wealth and savings; and dreams and goals.

However, child’s future emerged as the top concern, followed by focus on self. Financial goals also feature in the top five priority list.

Men are most uncertain about child’s education, whereas for women, protecting their health and having an active life tops the chart.

The report said there is increased awareness about the need to protect family against uncertainties.

Around 76 per cent of the people surveyed were aware of the need to protect their families against uncertainties.

The awareness is equal among both metro and non-metro residents, it said. PTI"
Unwavering Trump voters say they will not miss Bannon,"Chicago, August 20

Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon’s firing has been met with a collective shrug by some of President Donald Trump’s most committed supporters who argue the controversial nationalist became an obstacle to the administration’s agenda.

In interviews in multiple cities this weekend, Americans who voted for Trump said Bannon’s departure on Friday was the removal of an unnecessary distraction for the Trump presidency, while others saw his role as largely inconsequential and possibly overblown.

Many expected Trump to stay the course without him.

“Bannon was becoming too big of a story and taking the spotlight from President Trump,” Bob Janda, a 67-year-old small business owner, said in a bar in Chicago. “When that happens, your days are numbered. I think Trump will be fine.” At the same bar, Frank Cardone, 67, pointed out that Bannon had a brief tenure in Trump’s inner circle, having joined the Republican businessman’s presidential campaign as its chief executive less than three months before the Nov. 8 election.

“Bannon wasn’t with Trump for too long so it’s no big loss,” said Cardone, a retired electrician.

Before hitching himself to Trump, Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a hard-right site. He immediately returned to that role after his exit from the White House, vowing to use it as a platform to defend Trump.

Bannon, 63, has touted Breitbart as a conservative counterpoint to what he views as the liberal bias of U.S. news outlets and a platform for the so-called alt-right, a loose confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.

He played a key role in some of Trump’s most contentious policy moves including the travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations, departure from the Paris climate accord and rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

Bannon’s exit gives Trump a chance to distance himself from “fringe” politics, said Mike Corbitt, a machinist from Florida’s West Palm Beach.

“He (Trump) needs to be more center-right because the far right and the far left is not where America is,” Corbitt, 48, said at a Fort Lauderdale bar. “Steve Bannon was great for getting Trump elected, but now the president needs someone who can get his policies enacted.”

Bannon joined a string of senior officials who have left the Trump administration in the past five weeks, leading to the appointment of retired Marine general John Kelly as the new White House chief of staff.

While some observers have characterized the moves as a sign of chaos in the White House, others see it as a sign that Trump is running his administration like a well-oiled corporation.

“All these shakeups mean is that Trump is doing his job,” Liz Lingafelter, a 60-year-old nurse, said in Fort Lauderdale.

“He’s a businessman and is doing what’s best for the organization.”

That view was echoed by Rick Weatherly, a 61-year-old Denver maintenance technician. “I voted for Trump, not Bannon,” he said. Reuters"

Repair of unsafe Bhandarkote bridge in Kishtwar begins,"TRIBUNE IMPACT

Ranjit Thakur

Doda, August 19

After a long wait of nearly a year, the work on the replacement of damaged wooden planks has begun on the Bhandarkote bridge in the mountainous Kishtwar district. Situated just 10 km away from the district headquarters, the bridge was built on the Chenab river in Bhandarkot area of the district around 40 years ago. It provides connectivity to 60 per cent of the population of Kishtwar district. The Tribune highlighted the poor condition of the bridge in its July 27 edition, after which the government swung into action and started the repair work. The authorities have also replaced the broken wooden logs. Ajaz Ahmed Karaipak, a local resident said, “After the poor condition of the bridge was highlighted in The Tribune, the government immediately started the repair work and replaced the rotten wooden planks. Minister of State for Transport Sunil Sharma, too, visited the spot a few days ago to take stock of the situation.” “We have been demanding a new, motorable bridge for the past one decade due to the increased load of vehicles in this area which connects two subdivisions,” he added. Public Works Department (PWD) Executive Engineer, Kishtwar, Mohinder Sen said, “We have replaced the damaged planks from the bridge but the national highway from Batote to Kishtwar is under the National Highway Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited and they have handed it over to some other agency for further work.”"
"Iraq begins battle to retake Tal Afar, IS bastion near Mosul","Baghdad, August 20

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced early on Sunday the start of a battle to retake Tal Afar, a key Northern Iraqi bastion of the Islamic State (IS) group and one of their last remaining strongholds in the region.

The announcement comes a month after the capture by Iraqi forces of second city Mosul further east in a major blow to the jihadists.

In a televised speech, Abadi, dressed in military uniform and standing in front of an Iraqi flag and map of the country, announced “the start of an operation to free Tal Afar”.

“I am saying to Daesh that there’s no choice other than to leave or be killed,” he said, using an alternative name for IS.

“We have won all our battles, and Daesh have always lost,” he said, telling the country’s troops that “the entire world is with you.”

Tal Afar is located 70 kilometres west of Mosul, where US-backed government forces ended jihadist rule in July after a months-long battle.

In June 2014, IS jihadists overran Tal Afar, a Shiite enclave in the predominantly Sunni province of Nineveh, on the road between Mosul and Syria.

At the time it had a population of around 200,000, but local officials said it was now impossible to know the exact number still living inside the city as most are cut off from the outside world.

However, authorities have accused the approximately 1,000 jihadists in the city of using civilians as human shields during Iraqi and coalition air strikes earlier this week in preparation for the ground assault.

Abadi said that Iraq’s paramilitary Hashed al-Shaabi forces would help various army, police and counter-terrorism units in Tal Afar.

The umbrella organisation, which is dominated by Iran-backed Shiite militias, has already been fighting to retake a number of other Iraqi cities from the Islamic State.

“In the early hours, the guns and flags turned towards their targets,” said Ahmed al-Assadi, a spokesman for Hashad.

“Victory is near” in Tal Afar, an “Iraqi city taken hostage and humiliated for years by attacks from these barbarians,” he said.

IS overran large areas north and west of Baghdad in 2014, but Iraqi forces have since regained much of the territory.

Once Tal Afar is retaken, Iraqi authorities intend to launch a fight to retake jihadist-held Hawija, in the province of Kirkuk, 300 kilometres north of Baghdad.

Jihadists still hold areas in Anbar, a western province that faces major security challenges.

IS, which declared a cross-border “caliphate” encompassing swathes of Iraq and Syria three years ago, has also suffered major setbacks in Syria, where around half of IS’s de facto Syrian capital Raqa has been retaken by US- backed fighters.

But divisions across political, religious and ethnic lines will again rise to the surface in Iraq after the extremist group is driven out of its last bastions, experts have said. AFP"

Let’s step out and make a difference

For years we have bemoaned the country’s education and health system. The time has come for all of us to be catalysts of change

Also in this section

Our missing corporate conscience...





In the aftermath of the long Independence Day weekend, I am sure you do not want to read about the Prime Minister’s lacklustre speech and our squabbling politicians. However, since the celebrations were seriously overshadowed by the tragic deaths of children in Gorakhpur, I feel we must give serious thought to certain glaring holes in our civic system. I have little hope that the official or free media will do anything more than put out stories that either defend or attack the government’s efforts. The time has come for all of us to take responsibility for the priorities we have set in our lives and ask whether in New India, can we continue to carry on as always? When two-thirds of our population is young, what can be more important than their welfare? By this I mean health and education should be our most important areas of reform. For years we have bemoaned the rapid unravelling of the country’s public education and health system and yet, what have you and I done to make a difference? Learned educationists and social scientists have submitted reports commissioned by the government but these lie unread in some dusty corner. Huge sums of money are set aside and no one knows whether these funds are being utilised properly. In the case of hospitals, private and public partnerships are set up to provide healthcare but more often than not, these sums are siphoned off in that famous Indian ‘Vanishing Trick’ perfected by years of rampant corruption and neglect. These facts are known to all of us and yet not one of us does anything about it until a tragedy like the Gorakhpur children’s hospital breaks. If this can take place under the nose of the state’s Chief Minister and one who is seen by many as a doer and incorruptible person, then what can one say of the rest of the country? True, our enormous population defeats the good intentions of any government and a lack of funds and medical personnel are severe handicaps but the time has come to recommend some out-of-the-box ideas and try them out. Here are some that I can think of and I am sure readers will add many more. Community centres (such as Kejriwal’s mohalla clinics) need to be set up in all municipal wards. They need one doctor, one nurse, one pharmacist, one lab technician and a cleaner. Every mohalla has people who can volunteer to clean, assist and provide support to the patients. There are many retired people who will willingly help out if asked to give an hour or two every week. Why not tap the services of those who have the experience and will to give? In addition, there are doctors who are willing to work for free once a week to provide additional help and expertise to lessen the load on the local doctor. Space can always be carved out from within the area itself. I was recently in Kumaon staying in a village where a primary health centre set up by an NGO has succeeded in providing a neo-natal and maternal healthcare and basic medical aid. Doctors from hospitals of nearby towns come in a regular cycle and conduct mobile clinics to reach those who live in inaccessible places. Patients are then recommended for further treatment in the larger hospitals. All this has eased the pressure on hospitals where a large number of patients do not need anything more than a simple consultation. I am confident that there are enough philanthropists and volunteers who will open their hearts and purses if they know that the money they donate is well-utilized. Similarly, our primary education needs an injection of fresh support. In my own colony there are at least 20 people I can name who are retired schoolteachers or can help with extra tuition and help in English and maths (the two subjects that need most attention). The club has enough room for a durri and a blackboard that can be set up to hold remedial classes for the children of the household helps who spend a huge chunk of their wages on sending their children for ‘toosun’ to illiterate teachers because they have no time or expertise to oversee their children’s homework. This can also become a means of supervising the quality of education being given in our local government schools and putting pressure on absent teachers to come regularly. In short, community effort has to step in where the government is unable or unwilling to do more. We all agree that Swachch Bharat is a very noble movement but the reason it has been so slow in implementation is because those who live in swachch areas see no reason to help others clean their surroundings. Every gated community is spotless but step outside and you have to jump over piles of garbage and filthy drains. I have been reading on the net of citizens’ endeavours in Bengaluru and Mumbai and lowered my head in shame at our own indifference. In Gurgaon, young couples who lead busy weekday lives don masks and gloves to clean their areas every weekend. How difficult can it be to ask every colony to do the same? One visit from our local MP or municipal corporator can make a difference but how long can we afford to wait for them? Gandhiji was the last person who made a difference because he led by example. Reflect on that and step out."
Fraud case against Sunny Enclave MD,"Kharar, August 19

The police have booked Jarnail Singh Bajwa, managing director of Sunny Enclave, on for fraud. The case has been registered as per orders of Ekta Uppal, Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, on an application filed by Amarjeet Singh, a resident of Chandigarh, under Section 156/3 of the CrPC. The complainant had alleged that he had paid Rs 19.16 lakh on March 4, 2011, to purchase a plot at Sector 123 in Jandpur village. An agreement for the sale of the plot was executed by the accused. Later, he was offered another plot. The accused failed to deliver the possession of the plot to him. The court directed the Kharar SHO to lodge an FIR against the accused. The next hearing is scheduled for October 16. Last month, Bajwa and three other persons were booked on the charge of making an attempt to take possession of a 4-kanal land at Jandpur village. — OC"
"The Tribune, Business news","MUMBAI: Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel on Saturday called for recapitalisation of state-run banks to help them resolve the NPAs issue in a time-bond manner as bad loans at 9.6 per cent of the system is not acceptable.

Mumbai, August 19

Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel on Saturday called for recapitalisation of state-run banks to help them resolve the NPAs issue in a time-bond manner as bad loans at 9.6 per cent of the system is not acceptable.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

“Gross NPA ratio of the banking system at 9.6 per cent and stressed advances ratio at 12 per cent as of March 2017 on the back of persistently high ratio in the past few years, is indeed a matter of concern,” Patel told a gathering of bankers and industrialists in the presence of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley here.

Admitting that the balance sheet of most state-run banks are not healthy enough to take large haircuts, which is a corollary of any bad loan resolution, he called for their recapitalisation.

“NPA resolution would necessitate a higher re- capitalisation of these banks,” he said, adding “Government and the RBI are in dialogue to prepare a set of measures to enable state-run banks to shore up the requisite capital in a time bound manner.”

Regulatory or rather the economic challenge in dealing with the NPA issue gets accentuated when seen against the capital position of some of the banks, particularly public sector banks, he told an insolvency summit, hosted by industry lobby CII and chaired Jaitley.

The RBI chief said as much as 86.5 per cent of GNPAs are accounted by large borrowers.

“Swift time bound resolution or liquidation of stressed assets will be critical for delogging the balance sheet and for efficient reallocation of bank capital,” Patel said.

The government and the RBI are working together to comprehensively address the issue through a multi-pronged approach, he added.

Stating that the success and credibility of all the NPA resolution efforts will be critically contingent on the strength of public sector banks’ balance sheets to absorb the costs, he said any resolution will involve deep haircuts.

“It is clear that state-run banks will need to take haircuts on current exposures under any resolution plan agreed within or outside the IBC. Higher provisioning requirements on this counts as well as other factors will affect the capital position of several banks,” he said.

The measures could include a combination of capital raising from the market, dilution of government holding, additional capital infusion by the government, merger based on strategic decision and sale of non-core assets.

The RBI chief also blamed lenders for the mess, saying their poor credit appraisal systems have led to the pile of bad loans, which tops over Rs 9 trillion now. PTI"
Decrypting your home loan eligibility,"Harshil Mehta

Home is where the heart is. Though owning a home may mean different things to different individuals, one thing is common —we all want to own a home. Given the expense involved, most people prefer to avail a home loan to finance this dream, which is one of the most important decisions and undertakings in his life. Applying for a home loan can often seem like a complex process but one must be aware about some of its key aspects. Some important factors to be considered while applying for a home loan are as follows:

Income

This is the most important factor with a strong bearing on home loan eligibility. If the applicant is a salaried employee, then banks and financial institutions will consider his salary and age. This basically means that the loan eligibility will be evaluated on the basis of his income and the number of years the individual has worked. Lenders also reconfirm the individual’s repayment capability and the tenure of his job. One can also club his spouse’s income to enhance his home loan eligibility and can apply for a joint home loan.

Age factor

While applying for a home loan, banks and financial institution check the age of the borrower as this assesses the number of years the applicant would work. It is often believed that a joint home loan is easily available, but this is not the case always. Age of the co-applicant is also vital while applying for a home loan. For example, Brinda Roy, 29 years old takes a home loan with the co-applicant being her mother who is 60+, then the loan tenure will be calculated mainly on the basis of the age of the older person. The tenure of the loan will be restricted from 10-15 years depending on the bank or financial institution. If Brinda was individually applying for a home loan then her eligibility would depend more on her individual credit score than her age.

Debt

If an individual is applying for a home loan with other outstanding loans such as a car loan or personal loan it may affect his home loan eligibility. If one already has an existing home loan with over 12 unpaid instalments, banks and financial institutions generally take this into account while calculating the borrower’s eligibility. In such a situation, it is important to prepay full or half of their existing outstanding loans to improve their eligibility and ensure that their new application for the home loan remains unaffected.

Credit score

To qualify for a home loan, a good credit score is very important which usually ranges from 400 to 900. Banks and financial institutions prefer to lend to borrowers with credit score higher than 750 since it reflects stronger credit worthiness. This gives a clear picture about the applicant’s credit history, past payment behaviour and makes way for attractive interest rates for the borrower. Before applying for a home loan, it is most critical to check eligibility criterion. It is also very important for the applicant to know the amount they are eligible for and at what interest rate, which will help you to optimise chances of loan approval. Additionally, improving one’s loan eligibility will also have positive impacts on one’s personal financial planning and help move towards better financial security in life. The writer is CEO, DHFL.

"Sikka saga: Institutions need to outlive founders, feel experts","New Delhi, August 20

Leadership pipeline is critical for bluechip corporates to evolve into institutions that outlive their founders, feel HR experts, as the sudden exit of Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka raises questions over succession planning at India Inc.

While succession planning as a concept does exist in India, experts are of the opinion that some large corporations seem to be “struggling” when it comes to putting their act together.

Sikka’s resignation from IT major Infosys is the second high profile exit of an ‘outsider’ from a big corporate after Cyrus Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons in November last year.

According to experts, few companies in sectors like Banking, Financial services and Insurance (BFSI) are at par with organisations globally when it comes to succession planning.

“Building a deep leadership pipeline is a priority for any progressive and growth driven organisation as it is a critical element towards building a lasting institution which outlives its founders,” staffing services firm TeamLease Services Co-Founder and Executive Vice President Rituparna Chakraborty told PTI.

Experts also opined that it is generally seen that problems emerge when a non-promoter takes charge of the top job, as happened in the case of Sikka.

“That’s clearly emerging as an issue here and in the long run we need to watch out for same... it is important for promoters to clearly define their roles as executives, board members and that of a shareholder. If the transition between each roles is either too sudden or too late, it is likely to affect the future sustainability and growth of the organisation,” Chakraborty said.

Experts noted that Indian companies’ succession planning rates poorly as against their global peers, who often start months in advance to find a proper replacement.

“It is absolutely necessary for corporates to adopt succession planning; having said that it does exist in India although many of the new large corporates may seem to be struggling,” global executive recruitment firm Antal International India Managing Director Joseph Devasia said.

Moreover, vis-a-vis their global peers, Indian bluechip companies’ succession planning is “pretty non-existent”, he noted.

While succession planning at corporates has always been a matter of discussion, the issue is again at the fore following the abrupt stepping down of Sikka on Friday amid acrimony between the board and founders of Infosys.

“It has been seen in the past that the COO has been promoted to CEO in cases of retirement or a transit from existing role to another organisation. The people at the CXO’s level have been identified doing secondment job in absence of CEO and they have also been promoted,” leading executive search firm GlobalHunt’s MD Sunil Goel said.

However, he noted it is important that the person selected to lead the firm should be accepted across the organisation, by most of the board members and peer groups.

About the developments at Infosys, Suman Jyoti Khaitan, senior advocate at the Supreme Court, said it has been distressing to witness the differences publicly aired by the founders and promoters and the eminent persons in management of a great organisation.

“Such cold war is certainly to be avoided in the larger interest of the company, its shareholders and the Indian economy and reputation of Indian industry,” he added. PTI"
298 Indians granted Pakistani citizenship in 5 years: Interior Ministry,"Islamabad, August 20

Pakistan has granted nationality to at least 298 Indian emigrants in the last five years, according to the Interior Ministry.

“From 2012 till April 14, 2017, a total number of 298 Indian emigrants have been granted Pakistani citizenship,” the Interior Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.

The statement was issued in response to a question by the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz lawmaker Sheikh Rohail Asghar in the National Assembly, the Express Tribune reported.

In 2012, 48 Indian emigrants were granted Pakistani nationality, which rose to 75 in 2013 and 76 in 2014.

Only 15 were given nationality in 2015, while 69 got it in 2016; until April 14 this year, 15 Indians got nationality, the statement said.

Pakistan is believed to be a country where getting nationality has always been a difficult task, but innumerable illegal immigrants from many countries, especially India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Burma, are living here, it added.

There is one well-known case of awarding Pakistani nationality to an Indian national in the recent past.

An Indian woman, whose husband died years ago, was granted Pakistani citizenship on the order of former Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan in March last year.

Her citizenship application had been pending with the ministry since 2008. The woman had been married to a Pakistani man a long time back. After his death, her stepsons allegedly deprived her of her inheritance. PTI"
Delhi HC refuses to hear PIL to stop sale of liquor at airports,"New Delhi, August 20

(Follow

)

The petition, filed by a non-profit company, had claimed that the rules barring serving or consumption of alcohol were in place to prevent passengers from getting drunk while on- board an aircraft and it would affect flight safety through unruly behaviour by passengers.

A Bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice P S Teji, however, refused to entertain the plea saying the prayer sought by the petitioner was not executable.

It said that the relief sought was akin to not providing sugar to someone on the ground that it could lead to diabetes as the plea was premised on the assumption that everyone, who has had a drink, would be drunk.

The court also said it would be ""completely difficult"" to control what a passenger imbibes before entering the airport or after passing through security check.

""The court cannot pass an in-executable writ. The petition has no merits. Dismissed,"" the bench said.

The non-profit company, India Awake for Transparency, had in its plea filed through advocate R Subramanian claimed there was no point in prohibiting serving of alcohol on domestic flights if passengers were free to drink or purchase it from the bars or liquor outlets in the airport terminal.

It had contended that as per the aviation rules, the reason for non-serving of alcohol on domestic flights was to prevent drunken behaviour by passengers.

The petitioner company had claimed that the ban was brought into force after an airline, Damania Airways (now defunct), had started serving alcoholic beverages on its domestic flights, which had led to unsavoury incidents. The government had then held that such incidents were endangering flight and passenger safety.

The ban has, thereafter, been in force for over two decades, it had said. —PTI"
No insecurity in any section of society: Justice Kurian,"Tribune News Service

Shimla, August 19

Justice Kurian Joseph, Supreme Court Judge, today said as long as there was an independent judiciary, there was no threat to anyone from the so-called fundamentalists and no feeling of insecurity among any section of society. Delivering a lecture as part of the series on “Different Facets of Indian Constitution” at the High Court her, he said secularism was the “tilak” of the Constitution of India. “Hinduism is a way of life which encompasses and endorses all religions and Bharat has welcomed and embraced every religion,” he said. The lecture was organised by the HP State Legal Services Authority. “Irrespective of the fact that a majority population practises Hinduism, Bharat has welcomed all religions and given two religions, Buddhism and Jainism, to the world,” he said. “The Hinduism has always protected the minorities and safeguarded all other faiths and, as responsible citizens, each one of us must stand up against all such forces who try to divide India,” said he. Justice Kurian Joseph said the beauty of society was that it had never been parochial and always respected the right to freedom of speech and expression. He added that the Constitution recognised the role of religion in moulding the character of a person and making him a civil person who was not uncouth or barbaric. “My Bible, as an Indian citizen, is the Constitution,” he said. The so-called talk of feeling of insecurity among a section of society was partly created by the media. “If we keep thinking there is insecurity, it will only grow. So there is no reason for anyone to think that there is insecurity in the minds of any section,” he said. He also stressed the need for a debate on morality in the media. “It is difficult to be a conscientious journalist these days just the way it is difficult to be an independent judge. It is a big struggle,” he said. Replying to a query on the moral education in institutions, Justice Kurian Joseph said he was very much in favour of it being part of curriculum, but it had to be secular morality. He also inaugurated the six-storeyed complex of Lawyers’ Chambers for 280 advocates adjacent to the High Court. Acting Chief Justice Sanjay Karol said Justice Kurian Joseph, who had remained the Chief Justice in Himachal for three years, always stressed that justice must be guided by mercy. “You always motivated everyone to be guided by compassion and empathy and spare a thought for the downtrodden and underprivileged,” said Justice Karol. He said the HP State Legal Services Authority had undertaken several programmes like afforestation and pre-litigation mediation."
The Java connect,"Pulsating with performances, art and life, the city of Yogyakarta in Indonesia gives you the feel of being in a different era

Akash Mehrotra

An ancient city and the last remaining Sultanate of Indonesia, Yogyakarta has been a cradle of art and culture and for long nurtured the Javanese connection with the outer world. Old ways of life exist side by side with bustling modernity here and the city decorates itself with the symbols of Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. From shadow puppetry, the age old extraordinary Buddhist temple of Borobodur and the equally impressive Hindu ones of Prambanan, socially aware graffiti on the wall to the beautifully styled Batik designs; Yogyakarta, Indonesia’s second most visited spot, is a cultural palette on display.

The city comes as a huge relief from the urbane madness of Jakarta; narrow roads lined with trees, old buildings wearing a colonial touch, shops styled as pagodas, alleys lined with themed restaurants, art cafes often buzzing with some performances, random music bands performing on streets, endless boards advertising batik designing lessons, and strangers wearing a gracious smile; Yogyakarta gives you a feeling of being in a different era.

The city is always throbbing with performances, mostly unannounced. An art gallery will host a performer or a dance troupe visiting the city performing an ancient myth, puppetry shows in some random corner around the Sultan’s palace, rappers set up on a plaza, some impromptu performance in some coffee shop or even private homes inviting strangers for a local gamelan performance; festivals can pop up in any corner.

And as you remain on the lookout for the art scenes, don’t miss to do what all travel blogs tell you. Yogyakarta is a Unesco heritage site for its old temples and its age-old puppetry tradition. Put these in your ‘must-do’ list and then proceed. Start off your day with the Krotan Palace, snaking your way through the alleys of the old town, an area owned by the Sultan. The palace stands like a happy collision between the conformist and the iconoclastic. Perhaps, the most captivating, the Gamelan music, an ensemble of bronze percussion instruments, including gongs, xylophones and drums, often combined with string and wind instruments as well as vocals, can be experienced regularly throughout the week.

At a stone’s throw is the water castle. At a walkable distance from there, through the narrow alleys, housing some painters, designers and artists is the underground masque.

Cut to evening and brace yourself for some more artesia. In the north of the airport stands another emblem of Yogyakarta cultural heritage — the Prambanan temple. The towering temples with spires and spectacularly sculpted walls are a treat to watch. The temple also serves a backdrop of the Ramayana ballet, a spectacular staging of the South Asian Hindu epic, in a dance drama form, with firelights, extravagant costumes, gamelan orchestra, grandeur and an adroit mastery in story-telling. The town seems to have grown up with the Ramayana tales, no wonder many kids (including Muslim kids) have been named after characters of The Ramayana.

The Borobodur Temple

Ditch that urge to lie in late and take an hour-long drive past the enchanting countryside to the Borobodur temple, the largest Buddhist temple excavated in the early 19th century by the then British king of Indonesia, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. Sitting atop a hill, surrounded by volcanoes, Borobodur haunts with its striking architectural beauty. A colossal 30 metre-high step pyramid, housing some 500 Buddha sculptures perched around and lower terraces built as balustrades with countless sculptures from Buddha’s life and teachings, the temple is a sight to behold.

In the early 19th century, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles heard of the site and ordered its excavation. Even though one can find enough cues of this decay in the temple, Borobodur stands as a defining architectural piece and attracts hundreds of travellers and art lovers from across the world, for academic revelations and picture perfect moments.

Both Prambanan and Borobodur, give a peep into how elegantly Yogyakarta embraced and nurtured different cultures and religious ideals, which still live in the daily rituals of the common folk in the form of rituals, myths, stories passed on from one generation to other, puppetry shows, music, dance forms or just as symbols hung on doorsteps."

Track maintenance work might have caused derailment: Railways

New Delhi, August 20

The government on Sunday suspended four railway officials and sent the General Manager of Northern Railway on leave following the derailment of the Utkal Express that killed 22 passengers.

Based on prima facie evidence, a Junior Engineer (Permanent Way), a Senior Section Engineer (Permanent Way), an Assistant Engineer and a Senior Divisional Engineer have been suspended, a Railway Ministry statement said.

It said the Chief Track Engineer of Northern Railway was also transferred while the Divisional Rail Manager, Delhi, and the General Manager of the Northern Railway as well as the Railway Board's Member (Engineering) were sent on leave.

A senior railway official earlier said a preliminary probe has found that maintenance work was being carried out on the tracks where multiple coaches of the Utkal Express derailed on Saturday.

“Some maintenance work was going on, which might have caused the derailment of the Utkal Express,” said Mohd Jamshed, Member Traffic, Railway Board, at a news briefing on Sunday.

The senior official, who rushed to the spot in Khatauli where the accident occurred, said he had seen maintenance tools on the tracks.

“There is an audio clip of a conversation that we will probe. Also, when we did a site inspection, we saw some equipment of the Railways used for track repair present there,” he said.

“It is being said that some work was being carried out at the site and in that work the required precautions were not taken,” Jamshed said.

An initial report will be submitted to the ministry by this evening, he said.

He said the Railways has instituted an enquiry to be conducted by the Commissioner, Railway Safety, Northern Circle. The probe will begin tomorrow, he added.

“As per the directions of the Railway Minister, strict action will be taken against those found guilty prima facie,” he said.

“Commissioner Safety will ascertain what type of maintenance work was being carried out on the track in his detailed probe. He will also find out whether laid down rules were followed,” he added. — Agencies"
Novel approach to track HIV infection found,"Washington

Scientists have developed a novel method of tracking HIV infection that could help develop new therapies for prevention and treatment of the disease.

The approach allows the behaviour of individual virions — infectious particles — to be connected to infection, researchers said.

""This approach — and the ability to say 'that virion infected that cell' — will help bring clarity to the field,"" said principal investigator Thomas Hope, a professor at Northwestern University in the US.

""It allows us to understand what the virus really needs to do to infect a cell. It gives us new details, like where in the cell it happens and the timing of specific events. The more we know about the virus, the better our chances are to stop it,"" Hope said.

The findings could lead to the development of novel therapies for HIV prevention and treatment by providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of HIV's lifecycle.

During the course of infection, HIV fuses onto a target immune cell and delivers its capsid — a cone that holds the genetic material of the virus — into the cell's cytoplasm.

From there, the capsid disassembles through a process called ""uncoating,"" which is crucial to the synthesis of viral DNA from its RNA genome and the hijacking of the cell's functions.

In the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists used a novel live-cell fluorescent imaging system that allowed them for the first time to identify individual particles associated with infection.

They utilised the approach to monitor how the HIV capsid uncoats in the cell at the individual particle level. They demonstrated that uncoating leading to infection occurs early in the cytoplasm, around 30 minutes after cell fusion.

The finding is just one example of novel discoveries about HIV that might now be possible with the imaging system.

""Being able to connect infectivity of individual particles and how they behave in the cell to infection — which is what we really care about — is going to have a big impact on the field,"" Hope said.

""The system can now be used to resolve other controversies in HIV biology and to determine which potential targets for drug development are most relevant,"" he said. PTI"
A canvas for fashion,"Installations and scenography are the new buzzwords at fashion shows across the country

Swati Rai

if 29 Rooms, the installation at last year’s New York Fashion Week in Bushwick, is anything to go by, it can safely be presumed that art in high fashion is a globally rising trend. Designed to inspire creativity and, of course, Instagram posts, the 80,000 square foot warehouse saw installations by artists as well as fashion designers, amongst them the likes of Michael Kors. Kors’ concept titled The Sidewalk is Your Runway, had people posing with his famed bags and posting the captures on social media. Fashion and its interpretation have changed over the years. This change reflects itself not just in the colour and texture, but also in the way fashion is presented to people today. Artistic installations and scenography for a fashionably ambient presentation are an off shoot of that. Bold designing steps see couturiers seeking artistic outlet to jazz up the ramp and, in turn, create an immersive experience for the onlooker. While we have had the trend impressing the fashion scene abroad, it is catching up in India too, be it at the last two India Couture Weeks or Lakme Fashion Week. Designers have been successful in creating scenes and vignettes both on and off the ramps. Recently, seven fashion icons — Sabyasachi Mukherji, JJ Valaya, Tarun Tahiliani, Rajesh Pratap Singh, Shantanu & Nikhil, Abraham & Thakore and Narendra Kumar Ahmed — were invited by Godrej India Culture Lab to reflect on the Partition of India through their designs. These were presented in a fashion-meets-art installation at the Lakme Fashion Week and would be permanently housed at The Partition Museum in Amritsar. At the recent ICW, designer Anamika Khanna, in her show entitled Happily Ever After, chose to have a multi-dimensional mannequin theme reflecting various stages in a marital journey — from betrothal to the nuptials. Wide-eyed stationary models brought alive the theme with scenes created to match the outfit and the occasion. An installation is also about a designer’s mind. Also at ICW, Gaurav Gupta brought to the ramp a bit of the fantasy world he inhabits. An esoteric world found itself taking shape and offering the audience a quick mood elevation. The ramp became a barren yet rich moonscape with huge glass blowouts radiating in a purple haze as the show opened. It felt as if one was suspended in the bubble for a moment. In his own words: “I added a new dimension to a mythological forest by creating a floating space in between. It sort of mirrored the fantasy space in my head, which I inhabit most of the time. There was foliage in glass on the 10 installations, measuring between 7 and 10 feet, which we created.” A more traditional take was Manav Gangwani’s latest couture collection, India@70. It showcased the god and goddesses of India and meenakari on Patolas and Paithani to reflect different cultural imprints of the country. Big and bold Kathakali masks worn by models accentuated the show. A model perched on the grand staircase of a hotel foyer reflected the Prime Minister’s Make in India campaign, showcasing an intricately designed silhouette of a lion. Sharing his design landscape, Gangwani says, “The fashion industry has evolved over the past few years. We now have so much inspiration around us in India. Monumental structures, cultural diversity and geographical differences have helped me curate this collection… I have taken inspiration from every region of India to create this collection and to give the audience this experience.” FDCI president Sunil Sethi isn’t surprised by the increasing room for art in fashion. “Deep down, all designers think of themselves as artists and this creative force comes out in their collections — be it in the set design or as an installation fashion show.” Still, he feels art is just an embellishment for a fashion show. Designs have to be the real powerhouse. “I feel that the philosophy or the thought process of a designer will remain hidden if the clothes in his/her collection fail to do so. It’s the clothes and not the art work that is important.” While crediting digital technology and advanced projection techniques for the innovation on ramp, he hints at the limited scope of the trend too. “Such scenography has more scope and visibility in couture and not so much in pret,” Sethi says."
Bhatinda,"MC Commissioner directs municipal councils to clear outstanding tipping fee

Bathinda, August 19

After the National Green Tribunal (NGT) instructed JITF Company to operate the solid waste management plant at its full capacity and submit a report in this regard on September 6, the company has started video recording of the plant.

Officials of JITF Company and the Municipal Corporation, Bathinda, are working to implement the instructions issued by the NGT during the last hearing on August 4. The next hearing is on September 6.

MC Commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal has also instructed all executive officers (EOs) of municipal councils to pay the outstanding amount as tipping fee to the company before September 6.

Recently, the MC Commissioner also held a meeting with the EOs of 18 municipal councils in the cluster and officials of the accounts branch. At the meeting, the Commissioner also instructed the officials that in future, the payment of the tipping fee should be made to the company on time.

It has been decided to clear all outstanding tipping fee by Monday and submit a report to him so that, the MC Commissioner will forward the report to the Secretary of the Local Bodies Department.

During the meeting, the EOs said their economic condition was not good and the government had stopped releasing funds, due to which they were unable to pay the huge amount. The MC Commissioner told them to submit a report to him, stating how much they can pay and what amount they are unable to pay. He said on the basis of the report, he could take up the matter with the state government to get funds released.

A few days ago, a three-member team constituted by the NGT to check the plant and submits its report on it inspected the solid waste management plant. The team included PPCB member secretary Babu Ram, Joint Director of the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Chandigarh, Bimal Hatwal and Dr Fivi Johal from the Department of Civil Engineering, PETA, Chandigarh.

It inspected the foul smell coming out of the plant and monitored the plant closely for around two hours. It also checked the green belt around the plant, CCTV cameras and technique of disposing of garbage.

During the last hearing on August 4, the government told the NGT that it was ready to resolve every issue of the company while officials of the company said the firm had to bear losses to the tune of crore of rupees for operating the plant.

The company officials said due to a number of protests by local residents, the government stopped them from operating the plant.

For the past several years, the Bathinda cluster has an outstanding payment of Rs 2 crore worth of tipping fees, which has not been paid till date.

After hearing the government and company’s versions, the NGT has strictly instructed both to operate the plant in every situation and submit a report in the next hearing on September 6."

The Tribune: Science,"LOS ANGELES: Smartphone addiction, and anxiety caused by being separated from the devices, is getting worse as people are increasingly seeing their devices as an extension of themselves, a study has warned.

Los Angeles

Smartphone addiction, and anxiety caused by being separated from the devices, is getting worse as people are increasingly seeing their devices as an extension of themselves, a study has warned.

Smartphones have become an integral part of living, penetrating deep into everyday life as ""an irresistible intruder in time or place"" and enabling ""the extension of ear and voice"" for interacting with the world, researchers said.

""Nomophobia"" or smartphone separation anxiety is the feelings of discomfort or anxiety caused by the unavailability of a mobile device that allows virtual communication.

Previous studies have found that separation from smartphones causes increases in heart rate, anxiety, blood pressure, and unpleasant feelings.

Researchers, including those from University of Hong Kong found that when users perceive smartphones as their extended selves, they are more likely to get attached to the devices, which, in turn, leads to nomophobia by heightening the phone proximity-seeking tendency.

""As smartphones evoke more personal memories, users extend more of their identity onto their smartphones,"" researchers said.

""When users perceive smartphones as their extended selves, they are more likely to become attached to the devices, which, in turn, leads to nomophobia by heightening the phone proximity-seeking tendency,"" they added.

Dependency on smartphones is likely to continue to increase, as the advancement of technology continues to make smartphones increasingly appealing and indispensable by adding various convenient and powerful features that facilitate ubiquitous communication, researchers said.

Nomophobia, therefore, is also likely to become more rampant, synchronously with the increase in time spent using smartphones.

Researchers developed a model that identified a link between factors such as personal memories and user's greater attachment to their smartphones, leading to nomophobia and a tendency to phone proximity-seeking behaviour.

An online survey was developed to assess the levels of smartphone users' positive memories, self-extension, attachment, phone proximity-seeking behavior, and nomophobia.

""Nomophobia, fear of missing out (FoMo), and fear of being offline (FoBo) — all anxieties born of our new high-tech lifestyles — may be treated similarly to other more traditional phobias,"" said Brenda K Wiederhold from Interactive Media Institute in the US.

""Exposure therapy, in this case turning off technology periodically, can teach individuals to reduce anxiety and become comfortable with periods of disconnectedness,"" Wiederhold added.

The study was published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking. PTI"

Colours of healing,"Art helps make sense of suffering. This therapy is coming to the rescue of children undergoing behavioural issues

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour. Since the child was unable to communicate, the doctor gave her crayons and paper and asked her to draw and play with colours. A few such sessions, and the doctor and her team realised that over and over again the child was highly agitated and was drawing pictures of the male genital.

“Fearing sexual abuse at the day care centre where the parents left the child everyday, we concluded the worst. However, luckily we found that she hadn’t been abused. The caretaker women at the day care centre would look at porn magazines and watch porn videos. Invariably, the child, too, was a mute spectator. This was adversely affecting the mind of the child,” said Dr Anjana Thandani, a Mumbai-based consultant pediatrician and national secretary of Growth, Development and Behavioural Pediatrics Academy.

Dr Thandani is among the many therapists who are opening up to the benefits of art therapy to counsel and treat patients, particularly children, with emotional and behavioural problems.

The world is witnessing traumatic times. Increasing crime on streets, insurgency, terrorism and domestic violence, including physical, verbal and sexual attacks are said to be the leading cause of behavioural problems. It’s here that art is coming to the rescue of those affected by such issues. From diagnosing to treating such persons, art is being used as a therapy.

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."
16-yr-old boy dies after 45-foot fall at BAPS temple in US,"New York, August 19

A 16-year-old boy in the US has died after falling about 45-feet while volunteering on a construction project inside a Hindu temple in New Jersey, police said.

The boy from Hatfield, Pennsylvania, was volunteering on a construction project at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir campus on Thursday in Robbinsville when he fell, Robbinsville police spokesman Lt Michael Polaski said.

The teen was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital at Hamilton, where he died an hour later, NBC Philadelphia reported.

""The victim fell about 45-feet and the fall appears to be an accident, but it is still under investigation,"" Polaski said.

Police have not released the identity of the victim.

Vinay Limbachia, a volunteer at the temple, said people at the temple were looking into what exactly the boy was helping with.

The temple is inside a larger structure. The boy's fall occurred inside the structure, but in an area next to the temple.

The boy and his family usually worshipped at the faith's temple in Lansdale, Limbachia said.

A second temple remains under construction on the campus.

A spokesperson said the worship site has been built completely by volunteers.

The BAPS called the incident as a ""tragic accident"" and promised to work with Robbinsville Police.

""The entire BAPS family is heartbroken by the tragic accident that took the life of one of our young volunteers,"" the organisation said in a statement.

""The prayers, condolences, and support of every BAPS family are with the family of this talented young man, whose loss will be felt by all those fortunate to have known him,"" they said.

The temple with its intricate marble carvings and Indian design was dedicated in August 2014 and draws thousands of worshipers from around the world.

Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) is a volunteer-driven religious and charitable organisation founded in the early 20th century and named after Swaminarayan, a religious leader of the late 1700s and early 1800s.

It has major worship centres in Mumbai, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, London, Los Angeles, Nairobi, Sydney, and Toronto. —PTI"

With fresh flood-related deaths reported from across Uttar Pradesh, the death toll in the current wave of floods has risen to 69. Over 20 lakh people have been hit by the floods in 24 districts of the state.""The death toll in the floods has reached 69 in the state, where 2,523 villages in 24 districts are flooded affecting a population of over 20 lakh,"" the relief commissioner's office said here citing a flood report compiled till yesterday. It said 39,783 persons have take shelter in relief camps in the affected districts of eastern UP where there was no let up in flood fury as raging waters of the rivers emanating from Nepal caused havoc in vast swathes of human habitation. Reports reaching here said Army choppers, NDRF and PAC (flood) jawans continued relief and rescue operations in the badly hit areas. Release of water in the rivers emanating from Nepal and incessant rains impeded rescue work and evacuation of people to safer areas, they said. 20 companies of the NDRF, 29 companies of PAC (flood) along with two choppers of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and several columns of the Army personnel were on job to save lives and properties in the affected areas. A Central Water Commission report here said that Sharda was flowing above the red mark at Palia Kalan and near the danger mark at Shardanagar while Ghaghra was flowing above the red mark at Elgin Bridge, Ayodhya and Turtipar (Ballia).

"Rice millers, exporters urge govt to reduce market fee from 4 pc to 2 pc","Parveen Arora

Tribune News Service

Karnal, August 19

Rice millers and exporters today urged the state government to reduce the market fee from 4 per cent to 2 per cent to ensure ease of doing business. They said the relief would not only check tax evasion but also help in bringing transparency. They demanded abolition of electricity fee of Rs 170 per Kv per month and urged the government to charge Rs 5 per unit from them. Rice millers and exporters across the state held a state-level meeting here today on the sidelines of Food Show India-2017 and an award ceremony for contributions to the growth of the rice industry. Vijay Setia, president of the All-India Rice Exporters Association (AIREA), raised the demand for 2 per cent reduction in the market fee. He said, “We don’t want complete exemption from tax or fee as we know it is necessary for the development of the nation. But we want it halved to provide relief to the industry”. Setia said the government should allow all commission agents to procure paddy from farmers, which would also promote the genuine billing system. Hansraj Singhal, president of the Haryana Rice Millers and Dealers Association, raised the issue of the charge of Rs 170 per Kv per month and termed it as a burden on them. He said it was a fixed charge and the government should abolish it. Instead the government should charge Rs 5 per unit from the millers. Ajay Sharma, managing director of Lama Rice, counted the challenges facing the rice industry and said the export of Indian rice was increasing due to its high quality and packaging. There is need to educate farmers about the appropriate use of pesticides and fertilisers. Companies dealing in pesticides and fertilisers should come forward to educate farmers. Jewel Singla, chairman of the association, urged the Union government to grant interest free loan up to Rs 10 crore to every miller to upgrade their mills. Tushar Aggarwal, project head of the food show, said they organised such events to make the millers and the exporters aware about the latest technologies of the rice industry."

DAMBULLA:India will begin the journey to identify the core of their 2019 World Cup squad when they square off against Sri Lanka in a five-match ODI series starting here tomorrow.

[ + read story ]

Dambulla, August 19

India will begin the journey to identify the core of their 2019 World Cup squad when they square off against Sri Lanka in a five-match ODI series starting here tomorrow.

The visitors won the three-Test series with a 3-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka and will look to take that momentum into the limited-overs game. However, India are not treating this as just another bilateral ODI series. Chief selector MSK Prasad clearly outlined this, stressing on the aspect of fitness as Team India begins its preparations for the 2019 ODI World Cup in England.

Rahul to bat at No. 4

The first step in that direction is the declaration that KL Rahul will bat at No. 4 in this five-match contest.

The team management hopes this will prove to be a long-term move, ending the instability that has been associated with the No. 4 spot since the 2015 ODI World Cup when Ajinkya Rahane relinquished the position after an average showing.

Settled top

Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma will continue to open the innings with Rahane as the third-choice opener, given the presence of Manish Pandey and Kedar Jadhav in the squad. With MS Dhoni occupying the No. 5 spot and Hardik Pandya taking the all-rounder’s role at No. 7, both Pandey and Jadhav will be vying for that No. 6 spot.

The Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium hasn’t been a happy hunting ground for the Men in Blue, though. They have played 17 ODIs here, stretching back to 2004, and won nine of those matches, including bilateral and triangular series (in 2005 and 2010 involving West Indies and New Zealand, respectively), and two Asia Cups in 2004 and 2010. Head-to-head against Sri Lanka, India have played 11 ODIs at this venue, winning only four of them.

Bowling attack

India’s full-time bowling combination looks settled, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah expected to lead the attack. Kuldeep Yadav has proven himself to be the captain’s frontline spin choice, and the second spinner’s toss-up will be between Axar Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal.

Skipper Upul Tharanga will have his task cut out ahead of the challenge. But he will be buoyed by the fact that this side did manage to upset the Indian applecart in their last ODI match, played in the Champions Trophy in London in June. — PTI

SL need two wins in series for direct WC entry

For Sri Lanka, this series is more than just a matter of saving face after their heavy loss in the Test series. The hosts need two more ODI wins to confirm their spot in the 2019 ODI World Cup through automatic qualification. If they do manage this feat against India in the series, they will move to 90 points and then West Indies will not be able to overtake them in the rankings even if they win all the six ODIs against Ireland and England (taking their points from current 78 to 88) before the September 30 deadline. — PTI

London

Researchers have developed cardiac muscle tissue made of spider silk, to investigate whether artificial silk protein could be suitable for engineering cardiac tissue.

Ischaemic diseases such as cardiac infarction leads to irreversible loss of cardiac muscle cells, which is the main cause of reduced cardiac functionality that affects the working of the heart.

According to the researchers at Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg (FAU) in Germany, silk could be the key to artificial cardiac tissue. Or, the protein that gives the silk its structure and mechanical stability called as fibroin.

For the study, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, the team investigated the suitability of the silk protein eADF4(?16) produced in the laboratory for the production of cardiac tissue.

The research involved applying a thin layer of the silk protein to a glass slide. The technique is based on the fact that cells with a negatively charged surface adhere to films made of the eADF4(?16) silk protein due to its positive charge.

The study focussed, in particular, on cardiac cell functionality. The researchers compared these cells to cells that they had applied to a film of fibronectin, which is similar to the natural environment of cardiac cells.

No functional differences between the two were observed.

The researchers were able to demonstrate, for instance, that factors responsible for hypertrophy -- enlargement of cardiac cells for instance in athletes and pregnant women -- also led to a growth in volume in the cardiac cells that had been cultured on a film of eADF4(?16).

The possibilities of printing artificial silk proteins using 3D printing technology therefore represent the first steps towards future methods for engineering functional cardiac tissue, the researchers noted.

Ambala, August 19

The district administration has asked people living in colonies built on the Tangri riverbed in Ambala Cantonment to vacate their houses and shift to safer places after the water level in the seasonal river rose due to heavy rainfall in the Shivalik region.

After the water level rose, Additional Deputy Commissioner RK Singh, Ambala Cantonment SDM Subhash Sihag, Joint Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gagandeep Singh and Irrigation Department officials reached the riverside to monitor the situation.

An official said there was a report that nearly 11,000 cusec of water would reach Ambala Cantonment by 5:30 pm however till 6 pm only about 4,000 cusec of water was recorded. The situation is under control and announcements are being made asking residents to vacate their houses and shift to safer places.

The administration has constituted two teams comprising officials of departments of irrigation, revenue and police and the Municipal Corporation. Rukmani Devi Hall, the Bankey Bihari temple, Aggarwal Dharmashala and the community centre in Subhash Nagar have been earmarked for people to shift to in case of any emergency. Besides, local gurdwaras have also been asked to make ample arrangements and allow people to stay on their premises in case of emergency.

Health Minister Anil Vij told The Tribune, “The situation is under control. Officials have been asked to monitor the situation”.

The Tangri, a seasonal river, has shrunk as illegal colonies have mushroomed on its riverbed, posing danger to the lives of people residing there. More than 1,700 families reside near the river. To keep a check on illegal colonies, the state government has notified the riverbed recently.

In June, the administration had put up notices in the colonies stating that houses built on the riverbed violate rules and their owners would be responsible for any damage in case of floods. Meanwhile, residents refuse to shift from their houses and blame the administration and the government for the situation."
Money-laundering case: Hawala dealer Wani sent to jail till Aug 31,"New Delhi, August 20

Alleged hawala dealer Mohammad Aslam Wani, arrested in connection with a decade-old money laundering case involving Kashmiri separatist Shabir Shah, was sent on Sunday to judicial custody (JC) by a Delhi court on a plea of the probe agency.

Duty Magistrate Jasjeet Kaur allowed the plea of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) after advocate N K Matta, appearing for the investigating agency, submitted that Wani be send to JC. He was remanded in JC till August 31.

Wani (36) was produced before the court on expiry of his two-week custodial interrogation, the maximum the ED could be granted under the law.

He was arrested on August 6 by the ED after a sessions court here had issued an open-ended non-bailable warrant (NBW) against him and sent him to eight-day ED custody.

An open-ended NBW, unlike the NBW, does not carry a time limit for its execution.

According to an ED official, Wani was arrested in Srinagar with the help of the state police and later brought to Delhi.

The ED had issued multiple summons for his appearance in the case, but he did not present himself before it.

Shabir Shah was arrested by the agency from Srinagar on July 26.

The ED action against the two was in pursuance of an August 2005 case in which the Delhi Police's Special Cell had arrested Wani. He had allegedly claimed to have passed on Rs 2.25 crore to Shah.

In 2010, a Delhi court had cleared Wani of terror funding charges, but had convicted him under the Arms Act.

The ED had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Shah and Wani.

Wani, at the time of his arrest, was allegedly found in possession of Rs 63 lakh received by him through hawala channels from the Middle East, and a large cache of ammunition, on August 26, 2005.

During questioning, he had told the agency that out of that amount, Rs 50 lakh was to be delivered to Shah and Rs 10 lakh to Jaish-e-Mohammad area commander in Srinagar Abu Baqar, and that the rest of it was his commission, it was stated in the FIR. — PTI"
UK scientists create world's smallest surgical robot,"London

British scientists have developed the world’s smallest surgical robot that could transform daily operations for tens of thousands of patients, the media reported on Sunday.

From a converted pig shed in the Cambridgeshire countryside, a team of 100 scientists and engineers have used low-cost technology originally developed for mobile phones and space industry to create the first robotic arm specifically designed to carry out keyhole surgery, reports the Guardian.

The robot, called Versius, mimics the human arm and can be used to carry out a wide range of laparoscopic procedures including hernia repairs, colorectal operations, and prostate and ear, nose and throat surgery, in which a series of small incisions are made to circumvent the need for traditional open surgery.

The robot is controlled by a surgeon at a console guided by a 3D screen in the operating theatre, according to its maker Cambridge Medical Robotics.

""Having robots in the operating theatre is not a new idea,"" said the company's chief executive, Martin Frost.

""But the problem at the moment is that they are phenomenally expensive, not only do they cost $2.5 million each to buy but every procedure costs an extra $3,800 using the robot... and they are very large."" The Cambridge Medical Robotics said it was already working with a number of National Health Services-owned and private hospitals to introduce the robots.

The current global market for surgical robots is worth approximately $4 billion a year but this is expected to grow to $20 billion by 2024. — IANS"

Bathinda, August 19

After the National Green Tribunal (NGT) instructed JITF Company to operate the solid waste management plant at its full capacity and submit a report in this regard on September 6, the company has started video recording of the plant.

Officials of JITF Company and the Municipal Corporation, Bathinda, are working to implement the instructions issued by the NGT during the last hearing on August 4. The next hearing is on September 6.

MC Commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal has also instructed all executive officers (EOs) of municipal councils to pay the outstanding amount as tipping fee to the company before September 6.

Recently, the MC Commissioner also held a meeting with the EOs of 18 municipal councils in the cluster and officials of the accounts branch. At the meeting, the Commissioner also instructed the officials that in future, the payment of the tipping fee should be made to the company on time.

It has been decided to clear all outstanding tipping fee by Monday and submit a report to him so that, the MC Commissioner will forward the report to the Secretary of the Local Bodies Department.

During the meeting, the EOs said their economic condition was not good and the government had stopped releasing funds, due to which they were unable to pay the huge amount. The MC Commissioner told them to submit a report to him, stating how much they can pay and what amount they are unable to pay. He said on the basis of the report, he could take up the matter with the state government to get funds released.

A few days ago, a three-member team constituted by the NGT to check the plant and submits its report on it inspected the solid waste management plant. The team included PPCB member secretary Babu Ram, Joint Director of the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Chandigarh, Bimal Hatwal and Dr Fivi Johal from the Department of Civil Engineering, PETA, Chandigarh.

It inspected the foul smell coming out of the plant and monitored the plant closely for around two hours. It also checked the green belt around the plant, CCTV cameras and technique of disposing of garbage.

During the last hearing on August 4, the government told the NGT that it was ready to resolve every issue of the company while officials of the company said the firm had to bear losses to the tune of crore of rupees for operating the plant.

The company officials said due to a number of protests by local residents, the government stopped them from operating the plant.

For the past several years, the Bathinda cluster has an outstanding payment of Rs 2 crore worth of tipping fees, which has not been paid till date.

After hearing the government and company’s versions, the NGT has strictly instructed both to operate the plant in every situation and submit a report in the next hearing on September 6."
What a show(stopper)!,"From a collection dedicated to a red light district to a first-time showstopper for designer Rahul Mishra, the Lakme Fashion Week Winter Festive 2017 had it all

Manpriya Singh

Do you see bling?

Models…nah, artisans!

No showstopper rule broken

Lakme’s winter/festive extravaganza of the year, like any other fashion week, began with incredibly well-dressed crowd dotting not just the front row, but the one that spilled onto St. Regis and Palladium Mall in Mumbai. Back to the ramp and day one kick-started with Gen Next show, the future designers that we at Lifestyle have already brought you views from on a personal note. What, however, does need re-emphasis is Sumiran Kabir Sharma’s label Anaam. Whose debut collection brought the spotlight on the red light district of Kolkata, Songachi. One after the other, the models came, draped in austerity, demanding attention and respect. The sombre was more than offset by Ritu Kumar’s floral fiesta with her spring summer ‘18 collection comprising lacy dresses, tulle skirts and floral prints. The showstopper Disha Patani, in a white corset dress with florals, made everyone yearning for a dress like hers. What’s more? Masaba Gupta, known strictly for her quirky prints and prêt line, explored the occasion and bridal-wear with her collection titled Madagascar. Picture the offbeat brides in sari hybrids and her signature pop hues!Not that it ever went into hibernation, but the good old bling seems to have been reserved for showstoppers. Those ever in love with sequins, shimmer, mirror-work and all the other forms of cham cham were left happy and smug with not just one but as many as three showstoppers, namely Preity Zinta, Kalki Kochelin and Kiara Advani, in all their shiny festive glory.Day 2 too brought in a fair share of refreshing change on the ramp…humane and thought-provoking. The artisans, the people behind any creation and always relegated to the periphery, took to the ramp. Five artisans from Paramparik Karigar walked the ramp to showcase their collection titled Craft is Cool. This collection was made as a dedication to sustainable fashion. Craft is Cool. Indeed!Perhaps, it’s the one highlight of the week. Rahul Mishra breaks his no showstopper rule with Shraddha Kapoor walking the ramp for the celebrated designer. As for the Project Eve collection titled The Bird Song, he stayed true to his signature craftsmanship with beautiful chanderis and maheshwaris forming a significant part of the collection. “Project Eve wants to reach out to the larger audience with amazing price points and, obviously, Bollywood is the strongest face to have,” Mishra said about roping-in a celebrity face, while at the same time not being sure if he would collaborate with a Bollywood star again. Shraddha of course is all smiles, “For a designer, who never keeps a showstopper and if he chooses me, it is an honour.”

When stalking goes beserk,"GOOD MOTORING

Several things can go wrong on the road. You must know how to counter these

H. Kishie Singh

There was a very unpleasant ‘happening’ in Chandigarh recently: the Varnika episode. However, there are some important lessons to be learnt. The one thing that stands out is that Varnika Kundu is a very brave girl. But what saved the day was the girl’s presence of mind. That is the first lesson. Had Varnika panicked for one moment, the outcome would have been very different. According to media reports, the situation was extreme: two drunken goondas out for fun. Even under such a life threatening situation, Varnika followed a set procedure. The goondas allegedly followed her car and then drove alongside. Frightened and alone, she made all the right moves. She zig-zagged through the sectors — this is called evasive action. She was trying to get on to Madhya Marg when the goondas blocked her way. She reversed and zoomed off. They followed her. When she got to the next traffic light, a goonda got out again, banged on her window and tried to open the door! The police were waiting at the red light and nabbed the man in action. While being chased, she had the presence of mind to call the police. Another lesson learnt. Keep your phone handy, within easy reach. Make sure the last call was to the police before you start driving so you don’t waste time in scrolling. Do this before you start driving. Make sure your seat belt is on. Even if the goonda does manage to open the door and tries to drag you out, the seat belt will defeat his nepharious designs. Here is another very effective safety device. An after sales fitment is a remote open-lock switch. When the car reaches 20 kmph, all four doors lock automatically. Also, worth taking up is the fact that women have a habit of leaving their bags on the seat, where it is easily visible. Better keep it on the floor boards, out of sight. If in full view, the street urchins will not hesitate to open the door at a red light, grab the bag and disappear! A pepper spray is another effective deterrent. It should be instantly available at hand. Speed of action is your weapon. Even if the goonda opens the door or shatters the glass, welcome him with a blast of pepper spray. Blinded and in pain, he will stagger away. This is all the time you need skedaddle. Another deterrent you need is a whistle, easily bought at a children’s store. A shrill blast, continuous or spasmodic, establishes authority. It also alerts people of the danger and draws attention. If you are driving late at night, put it around your neck. Even if you are separated from your cell phone and pepper spray, this will be in easy reach and ready to use. A shrill, ear-splitting shriek from the whistle will stop the goonda in his tracks. The cell phone and pepper spray should be in a secure place. All cars have cubby holes for easy storage. Don’t put them on the passenger seat next to you. Should you have to slam on the brakes, these items will go flying onto the floor boards. If you have to fumble, the goonda will have the upper hand. There are so many things that can go wrong. Think about them and how to counter them. Goondas are bullies. The minute they face resistance, they crumble. Learn from Varnika, girls, and feel proud. Chandigarh has given you a braveheart!

In a serious case of sabotage before the verdict in the rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the landline services of the official residences of the Punjab and Haryana Chief Ministers, Punjab Police Headquarters and the PGI were disrupted following the theft of underground cables. Jatinder Mahajan, Deputy General Manager, BSNL Chandigarh circle, said as many as 2,000 connections, including the landlines services of the PGI, had been snapped. Besides, the internet service had also been disrupted. He maintained that it was a clear case of sabotage as only landlines services of crucial establishments had been targeted. Mahajan said the department was working overtime to restore the services through alternative channels. He said the matter had been brought to the knowledge of the police. Later, the police visited the spot and inspected the place, from where the cables had been stolen. Majahan said the incident took place near the MLA hostels in Sector 4 on the intervening night of August 18 and 19. HS Dhillon, SDO, cable maintenance wing of the BSNL said, “It is not a theft, it’s a dacoity. Five cables, each measuring 100 m, were stolen. We have never witnessed such a theft. We cannot rule out the involvement of anti-social elements who wanted to create tension before the verdict. The police have been informed about the matter,” said Dhillon. He added that such a long cable could not be removed without the involvement of 20 persons and an earth-moving machine. And, it would have taken nearly two hours to pull out the cables.The theft of cables has laid bare the fragile security of the Chandigarh Police. The cables were stolen from such high-security areas and the police didn’t get a whiff of it."
Indian-origin mom wants action over daughter’s suicide in UK,"London, August 18

An Indian-origin mother whose daughter committed suicide last year after suffering physical and emotional abuse at the hands of an ex-boyfriend has written to a UK police force to disclose evidence linked to the death and take action against the culprit.

Daksha Dalal wants Leicestershire Police to hand over any evidence they hold so her family can consider a private prosecution over the death of 25-year-old Meera Dalal in February last year.

A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assisting suicide on the day Meera Dalal died but was released with no further action.

An inquest into her death in May this year was told that she took her own life as a result of domestic violence.

“I seriously felt as if I would get some justice from the police but I didn’t. A loss of a child is an intense grief that you will never, ever be able to overcome. If I could help one girl, one child or somebody’s daughter, that would make me happy,” Daksha Dalal told the BBC.

She is trying to obtain copies of her daughter’s medical records, along with other evidence held by police and has written to Leicestershire Police asking for hospital and doctors’ reports, an audio recording of a call her daughter made to police, CCTV footage of the former boyfriend at her daughter’s workplace and all police reports in relation to the investigation.

A general physician report read out at the inquest earlier this year said Dalal was given treatment in hospital on one occasion, “having been the subject of domestic violence”.

The inquest had concluded that the former liaison officer for Nuffield Health, a private hospital in Leicester, died as a result of suicide.

The family had made a complaint to Leicestershire Police following Dalal’s death and the force was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

The 50-page investigation report contains a catalogue of police incidents involving Dalal and her then boyfriend dating back to December 2013.

The conduct of four police officers was investigated by the IPCC, but the investigator found there was no case to answer for misconduct.

Leicestershire Police said: “Following a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Meera Dalal who died on 15 February 2016, police found no evidence to warrant a prosecution being brought by the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service).

“As a result of her death, and previous contact between Leicestershire Police and Meera, an inquiry was conducted by the IPCC, which concluded there was insufficient evidence to consider misconduct proceedings and there was no case to answer for the officers involved.”

The IPCC said: “On the basis of the evidence available, and at the conclusion of the investigation, the investigator formed the opinion that there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable misconduct meeting could find that any of the officers had breached the Standards of Professional Behaviour, Duties and Responsibilities.”

Dalal killed herself at her family home at Syston in Leicestershire and was discovered by her father Ashok Dalal.

Her mother has since been raising awareness of domestic abuse through a Facebook page in her daughter’s memory. — PTI"

A few such sessions, and the doctor and her team realised that over and over again the child was highly agitated and was drawing pictures of the male genital.

The caretaker women at the day care centre would look at porn magazines and watch porn videos. Invariably, the child, too, was a mute spectator. This was adversely affecting the mind of the child,” said Dr Anjana Thandani, a Mumbai-based consultant pediatrician and national secretary of Growth, Development and Behavioural Pediatrics Academy.

Dr Thandani is among the many therapists who are opening up to the benefits of art therapy to counsel and treat patients, particularly children, with emotional and behavioural problems.

The world is witnessing traumatic times. Increasing crime on streets, insurgency, terrorism and domestic violence, including physical, verbal and sexual attacks are said to be the leading cause of behavioural problems. It’s here that art is coming to the rescue of those affected by such issues. From diagnosing to treating such persons, art is being used as a therapy.

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."
Indian-origin TV star crowned 'Child Genius' in UK,"London, August 20

A 12-year-old Indian-origin boy, believed to be having an IQ higher than Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, has been crowned as the UK's 'Child Genius' in a popular television quiz competition.

Rahul Doshi, who a few days a back became an overnight sensation after answering all questions correctly in some of the earlier rounds, won the Channel 4 show 'Child Genius' by beating his nine-year-old opponent Ronan 10-4 in the programme's finale last night.

The schoolboy from north London clinched the title by answering a question on 19th Century artists William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais.

""It didn't sink in straight away, but it was really nice,"" Rahul said after winning the title.

In the final, Rahul impressed with knowledge of his chosen subject — Edward Jenner's medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England.

""I was bursting with pride,"" said his father Minesh, an IT manager who had entered his son into the competition.

The final followed an intense competition — aired through the week — which saw the candidates showing off their maths, English, spelling and history skills as well as memory powers.

Rahul had been one of the favourites throughout, after scoring very highly in previous rounds — and even bagging a full house in the very first round of the series.

He had captured the imagination of audiences during the competition after he correctly memorised the order of a pack of cards.

Rahul, whose ambition is to become a financial adviser, had revealed his strategy for the final as: ""The key is to block out everything else and remain calm. So just focus on your goal. Mine was to answer as many questions as I could correctly and that helped me stay calm and do quite well in the early stages.""

Rahul has an IQ of 162, which is believed to be higher than the likes of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, and qualifies him to be a member of Mensa club — the largest and oldest high IQ society in the world.

He was cheered on by father Minesh and pharmacist mother Komal during the show.

His father attracted some social media fury for laughing at a wrong answer given by his son's closest rival, Ronan, in a tense finale.

""#ChildGenius an adult laughing at children getting a question wrong shocking behaviour. Shame on you Rahul's father,"" read one of the comments on Twitter.

But Minesh Doshi had been very vocal about his competitive side throughout the competition.

He had previously said: ""We are here to win. There's no two ways about that"".

Twenty contestants aged eight to 12 were whittled down to one winner over the course of a week as part of the 'Child Genius' 2017 series. PTI"

Amritsar, August 19

Senior railway officials of the Ferozepur Division, headed by Divisional Railway Manager Vivek Kumar, held a meeting with Rajya Sabha MP Shwait Malik here today. Malik is the member of the Railway Board to review the status of various development projects for the Amritsar railway station.

Heads of almost all railway departments from the Ferozepur Division were present at the meeting. Malik said the development of the railway station with an investment of Rs 145 crore had commenced with the beginning of civil work for platform number six and seven.

He said tenders for granite flooring on platform number one and kota flooring on remaining platforms would be floated soon.

He said work to instal four lifts was going on and another escalator at the gate towards Gol Bagh would commence once the civil work for stairs completes.

Officials said 200 fans and fancy LED lights would be installed. The air conditioned lounge at the parcel room, seven new AC retiring rooms and 26-bed dormitory would be raised at the station and high mast lights would also be installed at the parking lot.

A large sized LED screen, next to the enquiry window, would be installed to display the status of trains. A laundry to wash linen would also be set up at the railway station.

With a view to decongest the Amritsar railway station, the Chheharta railway station is being developed with an investment of Rs 61.22 crore. Malik said the project would be finished next year.

Once, the Chheharta railway station becomes operational, all trains would go there for washing as the washing line is near completion."

Clean chit to Capt in City Centre scam,"VB closure report says loss ‘imaginary’

Rajneesh Lakhanpal

Our Legal Correspondent

Ludhiana, August 19

(Follow

; and

)

The Punjab Vigilance Bureau today filed a closure report on the alleged multi-crore City Centre scam, giving a clean chit to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, his son Raninder Singh and 30 other accused. The defence counsel said a copy of the report would be given on September 2 — the next date of court hearing.The VB filed the report in the court of Sessions Judge Gurbir Singh on the basis of further investigation on the application of one of the accused, Chetan Gupta of New Delhi. It claimed that no wrong was done and figures of loss to the state exchequer were “imaginary”. The closure report relies heavily on the findings of arbitrator Justice RC Lahoti (former Chief Justice of India) in favour of Delhi-based company Today Homes, stating there was no illegality and infirmity in the contract and that the company be compensated. As per the report, several witnesses had been intimidated into giving a statement against the accused while several had claimed not to have made any statement to the VB in 2007. One such witness was BR Bajaj, former Principal Secretary, Local Bodies. There was no deal, the report said, between Capt Amarinder and Today Homes, which had got the contract from the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) for the City Centre project comprising shopping malls, multiplexes, apartments, a helipad and a parking slot. Evidence collected during further investigation made it clear that as CM, “Capt Amarinder only acted in public interest” with no malafide intention whatsoever. “Rather, he had taken several steps as per the law for removing irregularities” after eliciting the opinion of the then Chief Secretary and Advocate General, the report says. Neither the then LIT chairman, late Paramjit Singh Sibia, nor any member of the Trust had been found to have taken a bribe from Today Homes, as mentioned in the challan, the report claimed. Capt Amarinder had ordered a probe into the alleged scam in September 2006 on the basis of media reports but after a change of government, an FIR was filed in March 2007. Subsequently, the VB booked 36 persons. The 106-page charge-sheet mentioned 152 witnesses. It was filed along with more than 10,000 documents on December 12, 2007. Although the prosecution concluded its arguments in 2012, no charges had been framed."
The Guru of light,"The author has profusely used the hymns of the Guru to communicate his message faithfully. His verses carry the reader into a realm of bliss, assuaging anxiety. Over 150 artworks, both realistic and abstract, adorn this work

Kuldip Singh Dhir

Birth of Guru Nanak marks an enlightening era in the darkest period of medieval India. Nugatory rituals, superstitions, dogmas, fatalistic outlook, caste divisions, gender discrimination and diffidence to stand up against injustice, oppression or tyranny had rendered people hapless invertebrates. He took upon himself the task of redemption from all this as an assignment from the heavens. The motive force for this lifelong mission was his intimate communion with the Ultimate which forms the leitmotif of this biography. This mystic connection becomes apparent for the first time when Nanak disappeared at the Bien river to reappear after three days.

His message was of oneness of the transcendent. He argued politely but compellingly against futile customs and orthodoxy, liberating people from senseless beliefs, hatred, malice, cowardice, immorality, and delusions which had created a plethora of problems. Profoundness of his simple and persuasive teachings had an immediate impact. Extra-ordinary story of the Guru has been told time and again, but it does not take long to appreciate that this narrative is privileged to stand apart. It relates to the reader as much through the emotive word as through scintillating brush-strokes. Its storyline leans on factual details available in the Sikh scripture Vars of Bhai Gurdas, Janamsakhi traditions, Mahima Parkash and Twarikh Guru Khalsa. Sumeet has vetted these with the help of Bhai Vir Singh, Macauliffe, Dr Ganda Singh, Prof Harbans Singh, Dr Gopal Singh, Prof GS Talib, Dr JS Garewal and McLeod.

The author has profusely used the hymns of the Guru to communicate his message faithfully. His verses carry the reader into a realm of bliss, assuaging anxiety. Over 150 artworks, both realistic and abstract, adorn the leaves of this work. These are based on author’s own paintings and those of renowned artist Devender Singh, who happens to be his father.

These visuals speak in terms of multilayered creativity and boundless imagination, transcending determinate Cartesian barriers of everyday language. Flesh-and-blood characters, hermeneutical implications, mystical aura and creativity coalesce in this text. Abstract depiction of birth of the Guru, his refusal to wear the sacred thread, the Bien episode, discussion with Pir Dastgir and Sidhas, description of the Divine court (Sodar), the celestial song (arti), moods evoked by various Ragas / months of the year, and socio-cultural reality portrayed in the hymns are a testimony to it.

Starting with the birth of the Guru, Sumeet ends the introductory chapter with Nanak preparing for his missionary journeys after the Bein episode. We have a glimpse of his birth place Nankana Sahib, the birth of the extraordinary child, his family, and his father’s efforts to mould Nanak in the social, religious, cultural and educational framework of his times failing badly. The child prodigy astonishes everybody with rational thinking impeachable knowledge and precocious queries. The four chapters that follow present Nanak disseminating his message of oneness of God, dignity of labour, universal love, peaceful coexistence and socially responsible life, couching it in hymns of postmodernist plural tone.

Nanak acknowledges that his message was derived from a divine vision saying: “As the word comes, so do I describe it.” The people and places, customs and beliefs, habits and habitats, flora and fauna, natural environs and landscape, mountains, rivers and desolate lands, ascetic’s yogis and preachers of diverse faiths all come alive as if with a magical touch. He sang the divine praises all along. He often directed his Muslim companion Mardana to play on his rabab as he vividly sang the bani or Divine Word descending upon him from the skies.

Guru’s settled life in Kartarpur, his handing over his mission to Bhai Lehna, anointing him as Guru Angad and an insightful summary of Nanak’s teachings have been taken up next. The last three chapters give us a peep into the mind and message of the Guru by taking up three of his masterpieces, Japji, Asa di Var and Bara-mah. This unique biography combines skillfully narrative with the descriptive, real with the imaginary, and word with the brush-strokes to capture the persona of Guru Nanak."

"Tough to deal with continuous allegations, says Vishal Sikka","To stay on as Executive Vice-Chairman, help in transition

Bengaluru, August 18

Talking candidly after quitting global software major Infosys as its Chief Executive and Managing Director, Vishal Sikka on Friday said it was difficult to deal with unending allegations and said he has not decided his future plans yet. “It was difficult to deal with continuous allegations and noise. At some point you realise it is taking a heavy toll on the company and also personally. It is an untenable situation,” Sikka said from California via video conferencing. In a dramatic development, Sikka resigned citing personal and negative remarks made against him. His resignation was accepted and he was appointed Executive Vice-Chairman till a new CEO and MD takes over by March 31, 2018. “As you know I started three years ago on this journey. Infosys is more than a company, it is an iconic institution,” Sikka told the media. Terming it a sad day for him, Sikka said in many ways his resignation would help things to improve in the company. “I signed up for the technological change and got the company back to growth...I got to the point that was difficult to deal with. There was continuous noise about the same things over and over again,” recalled Sikka. He said he did not think on what he would like to do next after quitting Infosys. “We came to the conclusion that I will stay on as Executive Vice-Chairman, help in transition with UB Pravin Rao as the interim CEO,” he noted. Admitting that the personal attacks had hit the morale of the employees, Sikka said over the past many months and quarters, the company had been besieged by false, baseless and malicious charges. — IANS"
"7 mining workers trapped in rising Yamuna, rescued","Tribune News Service

Solan, August 19

As many as seven persons, including a woman and a child, travelling on a tractor-trailer, were trapped as the water level in the Yamuna at the Rampurghat area of Paonta Sahib in Sirmaur district increased around 5:30 pm today. Being the confluence of the Giri and the Yamuna, the area witnessed a rise in the level of water following heavy rain since last night. Water had also been released from the Jatton barrage into the river. The trapped people, all of whom were migrants, were working at a stone crusher and engaged in the mining activity when the mishap occurred. The local administration with the help of NGO activists, however, managed to rescue the people before the water level could wash away the tractor, said DSP Pramod Chauhan. He said fire tenders as well as policemen also helped to rescue the trapped people after nearly an hour. Mining Officer Suresh Bhardwaj said he had warned the people engaged in mining activity to desist from undertaking any such activity in this season when the river was in spate."
Soldiering on to Everest,"BOOK REVIEW: NORTON OF EVEREST: THE BIOGRAPHY OF E.F. NORTON, SOLDIER AND MOUNTAINEER

Lt-Gen Baljit Singh (retd)

“They were men, the likes of which we will never know again...... collect butterflies in the dawn, paint watercolours in late morning, discuss Keats and Shelley over lunch and still be prepared to assault the flanks of Everest or indeed the German frontlines, by dusk”. — Dave Wade in the Foreword. The biographer observes that “it was a statistical miracle” for Edward Felix Norton (EFN) to have survived World War I. But even EFN’s climb to the highest on Everest in 1922, even higher in 1924 and his advice to Col John Hunt that culminated in summiting the Everest, an year before his demise, was equally miraculous. EFN’s military career began after graduating from the Military Academy, Woolwich, and posting to the R Battery, Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) at Meerut, in 1902. For most part of the next 10 years, he would professionally profit immensely from the Indian Army’s frequent skirmishes with the North West Frontier tribes along the restive Durand Line. A year later, Major Norton would graduate from the Staff College, Camberley , and proceed to France to lead his R Battery, RHA, from the very first battle at Aisne in 1914 on to Marne, Ypres, Loos, Cambrai, Somme, Arras and onward to the last German spring offensive of 1918. His unflagging performance found recognition through conferment of the DSO, an MC and Mentioned in Dispatches for gallantry, thrice. After World War I ended, it was a natural choice to post EFN to the Staff College, as an instructor till 1921. Sometime in February-March 1922, EFN set sail for India once again, but this time as a climbing member of the First British Everest Expedition. On May 19, 1922, George Mallory, Howard Sommervell and EFN reached 26,985 feet height when bad weather forced a retreat. The British returned to the Everest in 1924 and EFN would assume leadership from the ailing Brigadier Bruce. The second attempt by this expedition was launched by EFN and Sommervell on June 4, 1924. Unfortunately, Sommervell’s choking cough so incapacitated him that placing him under the shelter of a rock-spur, EFN proceeded on an incredible solo climb of Everest. EFN’s record of getting to 28,126 ft, without the use of oxygen, wouldn’t be bettered till 1978. But even in Everest fall-out, there was a personal gain for was EFN — his marriage with Joyce, daughter of William Pasteur, a well-known physician throughout Europe and a house-hold name among Alpine climbers. Outside his family, there was not a word about EFN as a talented painter. The world learnt from Joyce during the Alpine Club dinner only in 1991 that EFN had carried a small sketch book on each Everest expedition and executed a few hundred, on-the-spot paintings. Shortly prior to Pearl Harbour, EFN was appointed Lieut Governor and C-in-C, Hongkong, where he earned fresh laurels but had an accidental, near fatal fall which necessitated his evacuation to India. He recouped sufficiently but retired on health grounds in 1942, with the acting rank of a Lieut Gen. Back in England, he would now gracefully oversee the affairs of his beloved R H A, as their Colonel Commandant from 1947 to 1951. The life story of this impressive and intriguing man, Norton of Everest, makes for an engrossing read."
"Gang of snatchers busted, three held","Had committed crime at gunpoint in Sarangpur on Aug 10

Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, August 19

The Crime Branch of the UT police today busted a gang of snatchers by arresting three of its members who were accused of snatching at gunpoint in Sarangpur on August 10 here. Signed cheques worth Rs 10.43 lakh, one cheque book, documents and weapon used in the crime were recovered from their possession. The accused have been identified as Sumit Kumar, alias Lucky, alias Sharry (29), Anmol Sharma (19) and Amandeep Kaushal (26). Subhash Gupta, a resident of Sector 38, had registered a case under Sections 392, 34 and 411 of the IPC at the Sarangpur police station on August 10 alleging that while he was going home from his marble shop, two youths came on a motorcycle and snatched his bag containing signed cheques worth Rs 10.43 lakh, one cheque book and some documents at gunpoint. On Wednesday, officials received information that the suspects were roaming in Sarangpur and Dhanas. After getting a tip-off, a team of the Crime Branch, headed by Sub-Inspector Ashok Kumar, laid a naka near the Dhanas bridge and succeeded in apprehending all accused and recovered the weapon and the motorcycle used in the crime. Sumit is the kingpin of the gang and has a criminal background. He was working at the marble shop of the complainant for the past six months. Anmol is foreign-returned and was now planning to go abroad again. The accused were in need of money and knew that the complainant used to carry cash daily. On the day of the incident, Sumit planned to commit the robbery and sent his accomplices - Anmol and Amandeep - to execute the plan. They accordingly robbed the complainant while he was going home after closing his shop. All accused were produced before a court, which sent them to judicial custody."
The Tribune-Sunday Special,"Beep, beep, cut, cut… as long as the lord of controversies Pahlaj Nihalani remained at the helm of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), he and the films he censured/censored made headlines.

Nihalani's exit and lyricist poet and ad guru Prasoon Joshi’s appointment as the new CBFC chairperson is indeed not just a routine change of guard. There is much to read here, may be a lot to cheer, if Nihalani’s words “god bless those who are celebrating my departure” are to be taken seriously for once. If there was little doubt about Nihalani’s absurd ways of working, there can be no questions about Joshi’s finesse as a poet and sensitivity as a writer. But can one man’s elevation and another’s sacking be the answer to all issues that ail filmmakers?

Director Hansal Mehta, whose film Aligarh ran into trouble with the CBFC, doesn’t think it’s fair to put the blame of all that’s wrong with the outdated cinematograph Act on just one person. Certainly tempers ran high when Mehta’s Aligarh, a film on homosexuality, was given an adult certificate, stalling possibilities of the film’s promotion. Time and again producers or directors found themselves at the receiving end. The list of movies that had to bear the brunt of CBFC, running in hyperactive mode under Nihalani, is endless: Udta Punjab, Spectre, Lipstick Under My Burkha, Babumoshai Bandookbaz…. Rare was a film that did not have a run in with the man obsessed with sanskar, Indian ethos and values. Lip locks, abuses, use of words like intercourse… anything and everything even a reference to a city or state could raise his hackles.

But with Nihalani out of sight, Mehta can perhaps rationalise that may be Nihalani was just implementing rules, or following the information and broadcasting ministry orders. If the latter is true, uneasy lies the time ahead. Ashoke Pandit, former member of CBFC (during Nihalani’s tenure) however, is more scathing in his assessment. He believes, “Rules were merely a fig leaf with which Nihalani tried to cover his misdeeds. Which rules say there had to be a banned list of cuss words? Or that words like Kanpur and Kishore Kumar can't be referred to. Nihalani wanted directors to make films as per his individual sense and sensibility. Which filmmaker would agree to that?” Besides, he reminds that the same films he censored were ultimately either cleared by FCAT or the courts.

Pandit believes Joshi is the right man for the job. “In sync with today's times, Joshi understands the world cinema and has worked with the very best makers in the country.” Mehta, however, feels that the CBFC should not be personality driven, instead be guided by crystal clear guidelines. That’s precisely why he would not jump the gun and hail the newly constituted CBFC as the panacea.

Actor Aahana Kumra stands pleased and fearless like the bold character she played in Lipstick Under My Burkha, the film that was even denied certification and is rumoured to be the real trigger for Nihalani's ouster. She says, “I am hopeful that with Joshi as the chairperson and actors like Vidya Balan on the board, path-breaking films, especially women centric subjects, will be viewed favourably.” Producer director Prakash Jha who has been at loggerheads with the CBFC has only one word answer — no censorship.

Is absence of censorship a guarantee of good cinema? May be not… after all there is censorship in Iran and the country's makers have been producing world-class cinema. In a democracy that India is, artists feel strongly against censorship which they insist connotes backwardness, just as George Bernard Shaw would say, “The first condition of progress is the removal of censorship.”

Whether Joshi can ensure that scissors are laid to rest remains to be seen. Right now Joshi, too, doesn't have the answers, only claims to have the right intent. And that's what really matters feels Pandit. “If Nihalani had the inclination to change, instead of bothering about nitty-gritties, he would have worked towards implementing Benegal committee recommendations which have been around for a year now.” Mehta is not sure whether the Benegal committee guidelines are a fit-all solution or that there can be a please-all policy. But Pandit reasons, “If implemented, Benegal guidelines would be a good start for sure.” Propelled by Joshi’s vision who clearly doesn’t endorse micromanagement, he foresees happy times for the Indian cinema. Round one of sniping and snipping may have lasted too long but for now votaries of cinema seem to heave a sigh of relief and reassurance."

“A play has repeat value if the subject is relevant”,"If you have been wondering who goes to theatre in the age of digital entertainment, there are plays that have been running for decades now

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

At a time when cinema has a turnover of millions, television shows have been running for years, actors and producers are raking in the moolah, including new entrants on social media, yet in all this theatre, the world’s first form of entertainment, has been chugging along. It neither has the money, the visibility nor the fame. But actors of every genre swear by it.

“That is because there is an audience which realises the thrill of live theatre. Any live event becomes more humane due to the ‘human error factor’ and that adds to the thrill,” declares Nitish Bhardwaj, once again performing the role of Lord Krishna in the currently running play Chakravyuha, which has completed more than 65 shows. His first role as Lord Krishna in B. R. Chopra-produced TV serial Mahabharata (1988) immortalised him.

“There is human touch and a live audience! Even the long-running plays have something new happening in every show. This is what keeps the adrenalin pumping”, says Jayati Bhatia, who has acted in television series like Sasural Simar Ka, Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki, Jassi Jaise Koi Nahin and theatre shows like Vagina Monologues, Blame it on Yashraj, Mahatma Vs Gandhi for more than two decades now.

A well-written and well-directed play often gets a full house and has a tremendous repeat value. The longest-running play in the world, Mousetrap, is written by English crime novelist and playwriter Dame Agatha Christie. It opened in London’s West End in 1952 and has completed 26,703 shows at its last count!

In India, too, several plays in many regional languages, have completed more than 2,000 to 3,000 shows. Many have been staged for decades with a change of actors and directors. To name a few: in Marathi, we have Ghasiram Kotwal, written by Vijay Tendulkar and directed by Dr Jabbar Patel (1973), Nat Samrat written by V. V. Shirwadkar and acted brilliantly by Dr Shriram Lagoo (1970), Katyar Kaljat Ghusali made famous by the singing and acting of Vasantrao Deshpande (1967). In Kannada, we have Hayavadana by Girish Karnad (1971), Jokumar Swamy (1972) directed by B.V.Karanth, Mukhya Mantri (play adapted by Ranjit Kapoor from a 1976 novel by Panchari Sen, translated by TS Lohitshwah (1978). In English, we have Dance Like A Man directed by Lillete Dubey (more than 550 shows), Hamlet the Crown Prince directed by Rajat Kapoor (more than 200 shows in Mumbai alone), Love Letters was adapted in India (1993) from Pulitzer prize-winning American play by A. R. Gurney. The latest sensation is English play Vagina Monologues, which was first performed in 2003, and even after more than 1000 shows, it runs to a packed house.

“A play has repeat value if the subject is forever relevant”, observes Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal, the woman behind Indian adaption of the iconic Vagina Monolgues (1996) play by Eve Ensler. The popularity of the play and a demand for it to be staged in places where English isn’t the spoken or common language, made them translate it into Hindi as Kissa Yoni Ka.

There are many Hindi plays, especially from IPTA (Indian People’s Theatre Association) like Bakri (directed by M. S. Sathyu), Ek Mamuli Aadmi (directed by Raman Kumar), Ek Aur Dronacharya (S. Dangyach), Sir Sir Sarla, Ek Kadam Aage (Makarand Deshpande), which have been staged to full house.

Actor Om Katare, founder of the Yatri Theatre group (1979) which has staged more than 5,500 shows of his plays, says, “No one can touch the charm of theatre. If only there were more theatre spaces, our plays could have easily given tough competition to other entertainment bodies.”

Veteran theatre, TV and film actor Aanjjan Srivastav says, lack of space and media coverage is the bane of theatre. “If we get more media coverage, popularity of theatre will increase. It will bring in sponsors, moolah and attract more talent”, he adds."
UP floods claim 69 lives; 20 lakh people hit in 24 districts,"Lucknow, August 20

With fresh flood-related deaths reported from across Uttar Pradesh, the death toll in the current wave of floods has risen to 69.

Over 20 lakh people have been hit by the floods in 24 districts of the state.

""The death toll in the floods has reached 69 in the state, where 2,523 villages in 24 districts are flooded affecting a population of over 20 lakh,"" the relief commissioner's office said here citing a flood report compiled till on Sunday.

It said 39,783 persons have take shelter in relief camps in the affected districts of eastern UP where there was no let up in flood fury as raging waters of the rivers emanating from Nepal caused havoc in vast swathes of human habitation.

Reports reaching here said Army choppers, NDRF and PAC (flood) jawans continued relief and rescue operations in the badly hit areas.

Release of water in the rivers emanating from Nepal and incessant rains impeded rescue work and evacuation of people to safer areas, they said.

Twenty companies of the NDRF, 29 companies of PAC (flood) along with two choppers of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and several columns of the Army personnel were on job to save lives and properties in the affected areas.

A Central Water Commission report here said that Sharda was flowing above the red mark at Palia Kalan and near the danger mark at Shardanagar while Ghaghra was flowing above the red mark at Elgin Bridge, Ayodhya and Turtipar (Ballia).

River Rapti was also flowing well above the red mark at Balrampur, Bansi, Rigauli and Birdghat (Gorakhpur), while Budhi Rapti was above the danger level at Kakrahi (Siddharth Nagar), rivers Rohin and Quano are flowing above danger mark at Trimohini Ghat (Mahrajganj) and Chandradeep Ghat (Gonda), it said.

Hooda plays down meeting with Modi,"Ravi S.Singh

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 19

New political equation may shape up: Dahiya

Tanwar unhappy with Rai MLA's remark

Capt Yadav seeks disciplinary action against Dahiya

Former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda today played down his recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi amid speculation on his possible political moves. Modi stopped in the central hall of Parliament to meet Hooda on the concluding day of the monsoon Session recently. He was on his way from the Rajya Sabha to his office in Parliament. The interaction between the two leaders was brief but the surprise element was Modi veering to catch up with the Congress leader after spotting him in the central hall. They reportedly interacted in Gujarati. Hooda said, “There was no political angle to the meeting. We know each other personally. We used to sit close to each other during official meetings of Chief Ministers in Delhi”. The seats of Chief Ministers are arranged according to the alphabetical order of states. “G” stands for Gujarat and “H” stands for Haryana. On interaction with Modi in Gujarati, he said, “I am conversant with the language. I was in Sainik School at Jamnagar (Gujarat) before migrating to Karnal for further schooling”. However, speculation on the meeting and Hooda’s moves refuses to die, especially in the wake of the BJP’s campaign to expand its footprints across the country. The reason for it has a political context. The BJP does not have a strong Jat leader in its ranks, and many see Hooda could be its possible big catch. Jats are scattered over nine states, albeit they are demographically influential in Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Delhi. Considering that BJP president Amti Shah lays much stress on micro management of votes, the party casting a net has a political logic. Hooda has also a pedigreed political and “nationalist” lineage flowing from his father and grandfather’s contributions to the Independence movement. Many in the BJP appreciate Hooda for his government’s stand in the case of Samjhuata Express blast near Panipat. The state police had concluded that the crime was a handiwork of elements across the border. The Hooda government had recommended to the Central government for a higher probe as the crime had angles beyond the state’s frontiers. When the NIA took over the case, Hindutva terror behind the crime got injected into the narrative. The line taken by the Haryana Police during the Hooda government gels with the line of the investigation under the NDA. Besides, the perception in the political circles is that the BJP has not been able to make a mark in Haryana even though it formed the government on its own for the first time in the last Assembly elections. On the contrary, reports suggest that Hooda’s “Kisan Panchayat” aimed at the Central and state governments drew good crowds in Haryana, even in the areas dominated by non-Jats.Jai Tirath Dahiya, Congress MLA from the Rai Assembly constituency in the district, has said the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in the central hall of Parliament on Thursday has political meaning. Dahiya has said whenever two top political leaders meet, they discuss politics as there is nothing permanent in politics. ""There is no doubt that such a high-level meeting can give birth to a new political equation and it should not only be treated as a formal meeting,"" he added. He said the BJP leadership had been trying to bring Jat leaders into the party's fold in the state as well as deal with the issues of Jats. Dahiya added Congress MLAs from Haryana had met Kamal Nath, in charge of party affairs in the state, and urged him to change HPCC president Ashok Tanwar. Kamal Nath had assured them of change in the party set up. Hooda had earlier met Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in this regard but so far the state party leadership has not been changed, he said.ocHaryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar on Saturday took exception to the reported statement of Rai MLA Jai Tirath Dahiya about the political significance of Bhupinder Singh Hooda's meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Tanwar said Dahiya's statement was against the party's constitution and amounts to gross indiscipline on the part of the Congress legislator. ""I will take up the matter with the party top leadership,"" Tanwar said here. TNSSenior Congress leader Capt Ajay Singh Yadav has demanded disciplinary action against Rai MLA Jai Tirth Dahiya for his remarks against state Congress president Ashok Tanwar in Sonepat on Friday. “The party top leadership should take disciplinary action against Dahiya for terming Tanwar as a ‘weak’ state president of the party as well as seeking his removal from the post. Such statements are unfortunate and may demoralise party workers. It necessitates action against the MLA to maintain discipline in the party,” said Yadav. — TNS"

Mohammed Dilshad, 48, is nursing a broken spleen and a wounded leg at the district hospital here. On his lips are just these words- ""Kudrat ka karishma hai (it's a miracle of God)"".

""We were all hanging precariously in the carriage. Many of my fellow passengers suffered terrible injuries. All, I recall is that there was a very loud and continuous thud around 5.40 pm and then the bogie was swerved over another,"" he said.

The S-2 coach suffered such a massive impact that all its wheels came off and it ended up dangling on the pantry car, with its one end ramming the facade of a house nearby.

""The doors were crushed, so we went to the emergency windows and then, slowly, we all climbed down to the roof of the coach below and eventually to the ground,"" Dilshad told PTI.

Shariq Nasim, 32, says he gets nightmares and his head whirls. ""I got hit on my head. Also, my leg got broken. I can't even recall if I was in S-5 or S-6. Mere thought of the accident terrifies me,"" said the city resident, before being taken for a leg plaster at a district hospital.

Over 20 people have died in the tragic accident that took place in Khatauli town of the district. Scores of others were injured and sent to various hospitals here as well as in neighbouring districts.

With the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, Modi dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied

[ + read story ]

Modi! Modi! Modi! Rarely is an Indian Prime Minister accorded such a rapturous reception by audiences wherever he speaks, whether at the numerous political rallies or gatherings at Madison Square Garden in New York or the Allphones Arena in Sydney. Seldom does a single individual make such an impact that an entire year is defined by what he says, does or wants, as Narendra Modi did in 2014.

So if The Tribune has declared 2014 as the Year of Modi, it is not because of his oratorical skills (his opponents, in fact, accuse him of spending most of his time speechifying). Or for the rock-star persona that he has acquired in the past year. It is because Modi, with the bulldozing fury of an iconoclast, dramatically altered the Indian political landscape, flattening in the process the Grand Old Party and adding to our lexicon phrases such as Tsu-Namo and India Modi-fied. In doing so, he achieved Mission Impossible: Winning a clear majority for the BJP in the General Election and forming the first government in 25 years that doesn’t have to depend on coalition partners.

In a country as vast and vibrant as India, it may not be wise to take a monochromatic view of developments that shaped us in 2014. There was terror constantly lurking, both within and without, that dominated the discourse. In the past month, we were witness to three such dastardly acts: In Uri, suicide bombers stormed into an Army camp and mowed down 11 soldiers and policemen; in Peshawar, AK-47 toting Islamic militants barged into an Army School and let loose a murderous fusillade that killed 150 persons, mostly students; Sydney saw a lone wolf hold hostage customers at a café, killing two of them before being gunned down by the security forces. In Syria and Iraq, a new form of Islamic extremism took root with brutal consequences.

The year saw crime and culpability apart from shame and scandal. The nation was shocked and rocked again when in Delhi a young working woman was raped by a taxi driver whom she had hired to take her home at night. In the region, self-styled godmen made news for the wrong reasons. In Haryana, one of them defied court orders for his arrest, forcing the police to engage in a pitched battle with his supporters to nab him. Another, who was charged with castrating some of his followers, unabashedly acted in a film that portrayed him in a divine light. The followers of a guru in Punjab refused to cremate his body after his death claiming that he would soon ‘return’ from his astral journey.

The year had many bright spots too. Indian space scientists took a stellar leap when a craft they built and launched successfully orbited Mars, earning them the distinction of being the first to get it right the first time. In Jammu and Kashmir, voters preferred the ballot over the bullet by turning out in record numbers in the recent Assembly elections. Germany defeated Argentina 1-0 to lift the football World Cup. And Rohit Sharma smashed 264 runs in an ODI to notch up a record.

If there were cheers, there were tears too, in plenty. Srinagar was inundated with unprecedented floods that turned the tourist paradise into a watery hell. In Himachal, 24 engineering students from Hyderabad, on an educational tour, were drowned when the water levels rose while they were frolicking in the Beas. A fire aboard the submarine INS Sindhuratna resulted in the death of two Navy personnel and triggered the resignation of Admiral DK Joshi — the first such on moral grounds. Internationally, the tragic shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines flight by Ukrainian rebels saw 298 passengers perish.

Yet, for India, 2014 truly belonged to Modi, who chalked out a masterly election campaign, complete with 3-D effects, to wow audiences across the country with his development mantra. Fed up of the indecisive and effete Congress-led UPA II, voters put their faith in Modi to bring about a decisive government that would deliver on its promises. Modi began well by inviting the region’s leaders, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister, for his swearing-in ceremony and then announced a slew of programmes, including ‘Make in India’ and ‘Swachh Bharat’ that fired the imagination of the public and sent stock markets soaring. Luck helped too with world petroleum prices dropping, pushing down inflation in India to near zero and shoring up the flagging economy.

The Opposition though felt that Modi was just a showman with little to show and mocked that the “achche din” he promised had yet to materialise. It didn’t help Modi one bit when the saffron brigade shifted the focus to issues such as conversion and love jihad. Yet, by the year-end, Modi seemed to be on an extended honeymoon with voters in Haryana, Maharashtra and now Jharkhand endorsing his brand of politics. It put the BJP in the driver’s seat in these states, unlike in J&K where the party made impressive gains but fell far short of a majority. In 2014, the Modi juggernaut seemed unstoppable. The New Year beckons!"

A travel back in time,"Shailesh BR’s most recent work, Tarka, looks like an interpretation of childhood memories

Monica Arora

Shailesh BR’s work is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected that you may have seen amongst contemporary artists in the recent times, and that is what makes it all the more engaging and awe inspiring. He draws inspiration from several concepts in Sanskrit, a language he studied and mastered for some 14 years during his early childhood. His creations reflect the rural upbringing and simplicity of life as in his village, where even an electric bulb was regarded as a huge miracle. In an interview during a Khoj workshop in 2015, Shailesh had articulated, “I do not know how to work, but I sure can create for my own and from my own.”A post-graduate from Faculty of Fine Arts, MSU, Baroda, the artist uses the ordinariness of mundane objects to turn their notion or existence around. He recently put up his first solo show at the Vadhera Art Gallery in New Delhi as part of Foundation for Contemporary Indian Art (FICA)’s Emerging Artist Award Programme. This show was known as Tarka, being derived from Tarka Shastra or the art of debating, enquiring and logical reasoning as prescribed in ancient Sanskrit philosophy. Through his myriad creations, he has questioned the origin, life journey and end of several objects and that is what draws onlookers to this unique body of work. Occupying centre piece at the exhibition was the Kshir Dhara, a series of sculptures that explore repeated actions whilst performing religious ceremonies such as the grinding of chandan on a slab or application of tilak on the forehead. These are used as metaphors in sculptures made from material such as wax, motor, sandalwood, honey, motor, water, milk, copper. Created from rubber, motor, iron was The Tongue, a set of kinetic sculptures that represents the various sensory functions and organs of the body that pertain to sensations of touch, taste, smell, sight and so on. Similarly, the Hot Tongue, comprising of plaster, coil and iron mesh, seems to be a satirical statement on the art of glib talking and nonsensical jargon, which is innately ingrained in the political and bureaucratic machinery. The most evocative of all creations was the Philosophy Machine. Essentially a wooden rotating disc fitted with lamps arranged in a circle, it has a gas flame pipe to light the lamps at one end and a blower pipe to extinguish them. This remarkable creation is a representation of the circle of life and is a stunning commentary on the fact that death is inevitable. Philosphy Machine Drawings was a series of 48 drawings. These inhabit little corners at the gallery and are mostly arranged as asymmetrical drawings on vintage, sepia-tinted and yellowing paper that appear as blueprints or pages from a novella or a personal diary or an old school examination. In most, there is no attention paid to any spelling or grammatical errors and reflect a childlike innocence with several drafts, cuts, scratches and random musings. Also, the 46 tongue drawings are an extension of the sculpture and endeavour to decode the tongue as an organ of taste, articulation and hence, as an allegory for human emotions, sensory as well as of the mind faculties. It’s almost as if he had taken tiny bits of childhood memorabilia and when he saw similar objects during adulthood, he re-interpreted those in a completely different manner and re-arranged the conventionality and typicality associated with them."
"Separatists, Maoists feel ‘fund-starved’ after demonetisation: Jaitley","Mumbai, August 20

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday said demonetisation left Maoists in many parts of India and separatists in Jammu and Kashmir ""fund starved"".

(Follow

; and

)

He said it greatly reduced the number of protesters taking part in stone-pelting in the militancy-hit state.

""Stone pelters used to gather in thousands on the streets of Kashmir before demonetisation was announced, but now not even 25 come together for such agitations,"" he said.

""After demonetisation, separatists in Jammu and Kashmir and also Maoists in states like Chhattisgarh have become fund starved,"" the minister said. Jaitley said security forces with their resolute action had established dominance over terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir and the Centre was firm that armed militancy must end in the border state.

Jaitley was speaking at a function organised by Mumbai BJP president Ashish Shelar. He spoke on the topic 'New India Pledge'.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was also present on the occasion.

Elaborating on benefits of the move to scrap high-value notes in November 2016, Jaitley said money which was earlier getting circulated outside the economy had come into the formal banking system.

On the BJP's vision of building a 'New India', he said, ""We want to spend funds on defence, rural development and infrastructure.""

""We should have world-class public institutions so that shameful incidents such as the Gorakhpur tragedy do not recur,"" he said.

The finance minister said the Modi government was not satisfied with a 7-7.5 per cent GDP growth rate.

To accelerate the growth rate, the government would continue to take tough decisions in the interest of the nation as it had done since coming into power in 2014, he said.

Jaitley listed several achievements of the BJP-led government, which had completed three years in power.

Among them, he spoke about the GST rollout, notes ban, the insolvency and bankruptcy code, amendment to laws related to benami transactions, fair allocation of spectrum and natural resources and double taxation avoidance treaties signed with various countries. — PTI"

The Tribune: Science,"LOS ANGELES: Smartphone addiction, and anxiety caused by being separated from the devices, is getting worse as people are increasingly seeing their devices as an extension of themselves, a study has warned.

Los Angeles

Smartphone addiction, and anxiety caused by being separated from the devices, is getting worse as people are increasingly seeing their devices as an extension of themselves, a study has warned.

Smartphones have become an integral part of living, penetrating deep into everyday life as ""an irresistible intruder in time or place"" and enabling ""the extension of ear and voice"" for interacting with the world, researchers said.

""Nomophobia"" or smartphone separation anxiety is the feelings of discomfort or anxiety caused by the unavailability of a mobile device that allows virtual communication.

Previous studies have found that separation from smartphones causes increases in heart rate, anxiety, blood pressure, and unpleasant feelings.

Researchers, including those from University of Hong Kong found that when users perceive smartphones as their extended selves, they are more likely to get attached to the devices, which, in turn, leads to nomophobia by heightening the phone proximity-seeking tendency.

""As smartphones evoke more personal memories, users extend more of their identity onto their smartphones,"" researchers said.

""When users perceive smartphones as their extended selves, they are more likely to become attached to the devices, which, in turn, leads to nomophobia by heightening the phone proximity-seeking tendency,"" they added.

Dependency on smartphones is likely to continue to increase, as the advancement of technology continues to make smartphones increasingly appealing and indispensable by adding various convenient and powerful features that facilitate ubiquitous communication, researchers said.

Nomophobia, therefore, is also likely to become more rampant, synchronously with the increase in time spent using smartphones.

Researchers developed a model that identified a link between factors such as personal memories and user's greater attachment to their smartphones, leading to nomophobia and a tendency to phone proximity-seeking behaviour.

An online survey was developed to assess the levels of smartphone users' positive memories, self-extension, attachment, phone proximity-seeking behavior, and nomophobia.

""Nomophobia, fear of missing out (FoMo), and fear of being offline (FoBo) — all anxieties born of our new high-tech lifestyles — may be treated similarly to other more traditional phobias,"" said Brenda K Wiederhold from Interactive Media Institute in the US.

""Exposure therapy, in this case turning off technology periodically, can teach individuals to reduce anxiety and become comfortable with periods of disconnectedness,"" Wiederhold added.

The study was published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking. PTI"

Army to add more teeth to T-90 battle tanks,"New Delhi, August 20

As part of efforts to enhance its strike capability, the Army is now working on a project to add more teeth to its T-90 main battle tanks by arming them with a third-generation missile system.

(Follow

; and

)

Currently, the T-90 tanks are equipped with a laser-guided INVAR missile system and the Army has decided to replace them with a third generation gun-launched missile, army sources said.

""As the design of the existing INVAR missile has been maximised, both in terms of range and depth of penetration (DoP), it is imperative to upgrade it to next generation missiles with enhanced capability,"" according to a document related to the project.

The Russian-origin T-90 tanks are mainstays of the Indian Army's offensive formations.

The sources said the third generation missile should achieve a DoP of 800-850 mm and will be capable of hitting targets up to a range of 8 km in day as well as night.

The missiles, to be fired from the 125mm gun barrels of T-90 tanks, will be able to hit targets by taking a pre-flight programmed manoeuvres.

The missiles should be capable of firing against mobile as well as static targets, the sources said.

The Army is also working on a separate project to install a modular engine for the T-90 tanks so as to enhance their strike capability in high-altitude battlefield.

The sources said the proposed modular engine for T-90 tanks is envisaged to have a variable power output of 1200-1500 HP to cater to high battlefield agility.

Considering the evolving security scenario in the region, the government has taken a series of measures in the last few months to enhance strike capability of the Army.

Last month, the government had empowered the Army to directly procure critical ammunition and spares of major military platforms to maintain combat readiness for short duration ""intense wars"".

According to the decision, the Vice Chief of Army has been given the ""full"" financial powers to procure ammunition and spares for 10 types of weapons systems and equipment.

The government has also decided to speed up procurement of key weapons systems and platforms for the Army.

In a major decision, the defence ministry on Thursday approved procurement of six Apache helicopters along with weapons systems from American giant Boeing at a cost of Rs 4,168 crore for the Army which will be its first fleet of attack choppers. — PTI"

"Nadal climbs to the top, falls hard against Kyrgios","Australian eases past new world No. 1 to enter semis

Cincinnati, August 19

Australia’s Nick Kyrgios humbled new world No. 1 Rafael Nadal 6-2 7-5, winning twice in one day to reach the Cincinnati Masters semifinals. On a day when defending champion Karolina Pliskova won twice in one day for the third time this season to tighten her grip on the world No. 1 ranking, Kyrgios stole the show by overpowering the 15-time Grand Slam champion after each had won earlier. The 22-year-old from Canberra was up a double break in 10 minutes, seizing the chance to make a between-the-legs showoff shot on his way to a 4-0 lead, drawing boos from the crowd. Kyrgios, ranked 23rd, took the first set in 25 minutes, dropping only three points on his serve while taking seven of eight points off the 31-year-old Spaniard’s second serves. Nadal netted a forehand to surrender a break and a 3-2 lead to Kyrgios in the second set. The Aussie served for the match in the 10th game but double faulted on his third match point and Nadal had new life, screaming, “Come On.” But Kyrgios broke again to lead 6-5 and this time end matters with his 10th ace after 80 minutes, improving to 2-2 all-time against Nadal and booking a semifinal against Spain’s David Ferrer. Bulgaria’s 11th-ranked Grigor Dimitrov plays American John Isner in the other semifinal. Earlier, Kyrgios defeated Croatia’s Ivo Karlovic 4-6 7-6(6) 6-3 and Nadal downed compatriot Albert Ramos-Vinolas 7-6(1) 6-2.

Halep beats Konta

Pliskova, fighting to hold off Romania’s Simona Halep atop the rankings, first ousted Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi 6-3 4-6 6-0 in one of five matches postponed from Thursday due to rain. With only two hours between matches, the 25-year-old Czech defeated Denmark’s fifth-ranked Caroline Wozniacki 6-2 6-4 to book a semifinal against Wimbledon champ Garbine Muguruza. Second-ranked Halep eliminated British seventh seed Johanna Konta 6-4 7-6(1) to book a semifinal date with US wildcard Sloane Stephens. Halep must capture the crown to swipe the top spot in Monday’s rankings.

Support to Barcelona

Nadal was assured of moving into the top ranking on Monday for the first time since July 2014 when Roger Federer withdrew from Cincinnati with a back injury. Nadal and Ramos-Vinolas wore black ribbons on their shirts in memory of victims of Thursday’s terror attack in Barcelona. “Everyone is very, very sad. I don’t have words to say, because when these kind of things happen, is difficult,” Nadal said. “All my support to Barcelona.” Drawing on a camera lens after the final match, Kyrgios wrote “Barcelona” and drew a heart. Sixth-ranked Spaniard Muguruza, wearing a black ribbon on her visor, ousted Russian eighth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-2 5-7 7-5. Ferrer upset Austria’s eighth-ranked Dominic Thiem 6-3 6-3, while Isner fired 25 aces in beating American wildcard Jared Donaldson 7-6(4) 7-5 and Dimitrov downed Japan’s Yuichi Sugita 6-2 6-1. — AFP

The Tribune-Sunday Special,"Beep, beep, cut, cut… as long as the lord of controversies Pahlaj Nihalani remained at the helm of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), he and the films he censured/censored made headlines.

Nihalani's exit and lyricist poet and ad guru Prasoon Joshi’s appointment as the new CBFC chairperson is indeed not just a routine change of guard. There is much to read here, may be a lot to cheer, if Nihalani’s words “god bless those who are celebrating my departure” are to be taken seriously for once. If there was little doubt about Nihalani’s absurd ways of working, there can be no questions about Joshi’s finesse as a poet and sensitivity as a writer. But can one man’s elevation and another’s sacking be the answer to all issues that ail filmmakers?

Director Hansal Mehta, whose film Aligarh ran into trouble with the CBFC, doesn’t think it’s fair to put the blame of all that’s wrong with the outdated cinematograph Act on just one person. Certainly tempers ran high when Mehta’s Aligarh, a film on homosexuality, was given an adult certificate, stalling possibilities of the film’s promotion. Time and again producers or directors found themselves at the receiving end. The list of movies that had to bear the brunt of CBFC, running in hyperactive mode under Nihalani, is endless: Udta Punjab, Spectre, Lipstick Under My Burkha, Babumoshai Bandookbaz…. Rare was a film that did not have a run in with the man obsessed with sanskar, Indian ethos and values. Lip locks, abuses, use of words like intercourse… anything and everything even a reference to a city or state could raise his hackles.

But with Nihalani out of sight, Mehta can perhaps rationalise that may be Nihalani was just implementing rules, or following the information and broadcasting ministry orders. If the latter is true, uneasy lies the time ahead. Ashoke Pandit, former member of CBFC (during Nihalani’s tenure) however, is more scathing in his assessment. He believes, “Rules were merely a fig leaf with which Nihalani tried to cover his misdeeds. Which rules say there had to be a banned list of cuss words? Or that words like Kanpur and Kishore Kumar can't be referred to. Nihalani wanted directors to make films as per his individual sense and sensibility. Which filmmaker would agree to that?” Besides, he reminds that the same films he censored were ultimately either cleared by FCAT or the courts.

Pandit believes Joshi is the right man for the job. “In sync with today's times, Joshi understands the world cinema and has worked with the very best makers in the country.” Mehta, however, feels that the CBFC should not be personality driven, instead be guided by crystal clear guidelines. That’s precisely why he would not jump the gun and hail the newly constituted CBFC as the panacea.

Actor Aahana Kumra stands pleased and fearless like the bold character she played in Lipstick Under My Burkha, the film that was even denied certification and is rumoured to be the real trigger for Nihalani's ouster. She says, “I am hopeful that with Joshi as the chairperson and actors like Vidya Balan on the board, path-breaking films, especially women centric subjects, will be viewed favourably.” Producer director Prakash Jha who has been at loggerheads with the CBFC has only one word answer — no censorship.

Is absence of censorship a guarantee of good cinema? May be not… after all there is censorship in Iran and the country's makers have been producing world-class cinema. In a democracy that India is, artists feel strongly against censorship which they insist connotes backwardness, just as George Bernard Shaw would say, “The first condition of progress is the removal of censorship.”

Whether Joshi can ensure that scissors are laid to rest remains to be seen. Right now Joshi, too, doesn't have the answers, only claims to have the right intent. And that's what really matters feels Pandit. “If Nihalani had the inclination to change, instead of bothering about nitty-gritties, he would have worked towards implementing Benegal committee recommendations which have been around for a year now.” Mehta is not sure whether the Benegal committee guidelines are a fit-all solution or that there can be a please-all policy. But Pandit reasons, “If implemented, Benegal guidelines would be a good start for sure.” Propelled by Joshi’s vision who clearly doesn’t endorse micromanagement, he foresees happy times for the Indian cinema. Round one of sniping and snipping may have lasted too long but for now votaries of cinema seem to heave a sigh of relief and reassurance."
"Cut VAT on natural gas, other fuels, Jaitley writes to CMs","Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 18

Fuels like natural gas have been kept out of the GST but are used as inputs for goods that come under the new indirect tax regime

Crude oil, petrol, diesel, natural gas and jet fuel have also been kept out of the GST

While natural gas is used for power generation and in manufacturing fertiliser, petrochemicals and glass, crude oil is used to make petrol and diesel as also kerosene, LPG and industrial fuels like naptha, fuel oil and bitumen

While other industries can claim input tax credit, these industries cannot do so as these products and natural gas are out of the GST’s ambit

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has written to state Chief Ministers seeking a cut in sales tax or VAT on fuels like natural gas that have been kept out of the GST but are used as inputs for goods that come under the new indirect tax regime. Crude oil, petrol, diesel, natural gas and jet fuel (ATF) have been kept out of the GST which kicked in from July, replacing over a dozen central and state levies like central excise, service tax and VAT with a single uniform levy. “The letter by Finance Minister highlights a concern being raised by the manufacturing sector in the country regarding the rise in input costs of petroleum products happening on account of transition to GST regime,” an official statement said. Inputs like natural gas are used for power generation and in manufacturing fertiliser, petrochemicals and a variety of products like glass. Crude oil is used to make petrol and diesel as also kerosene, LPG and industrial fuels like naptha, fuel oil and bitumen. While other industries can claim input tax credit or set off tax paid on inputs with that paid on the final product, these industries cannot do so as crude oil, three petroleum products and natural gas are out of the GST’s ambit. This raises cost for the industries using any of the five products as inputs. Jaitley has written to state Chief Ministers “urging them to reduce burden of Value Added Tax (VAT) on petroleum products used as inputs in making of goods after the introduction of GST”, said the statement. “In the pre-GST regime, because the petroleum products as well as the final goods produced both attracted VAT, input tax credit of petroleum products being used as inputs by manufacturers was allowed to varying extent by different states. “However, in the post-GST scenario, the manufactured goods attract GST while the inputs of petroleum products used in the manufacturing attract VAT and, therefore, it would lead to cascading of taxes,” it said. Some states had lowered VAT to 5% on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) used for manufacturing of goods. Some others had cut VAT on diesel. VAT on diesel ranges from 17.4% in Delhi to 31.06% in Andhra Pradesh. On natural gas, it varies from nil to 15%. Natural gas alternatives such as naphtha, fuel oil and LPG are already included in the GST. While LPG will be taxed at 5%, naphtha and fuel oil will be taxed at 18%."
Residents of colonies built on Tangri riverbed told to shift,"Water level in the seasonal river has risen after heavy rainfall

Tribune News Service

Ambala, August 19

The district administration has asked people living in colonies built on the Tangri riverbed in Ambala Cantonment to vacate their houses and shift to safer places after the water level in the seasonal river rose due to heavy rainfall in the Shivalik region. After the water level rose, Additional Deputy Commissioner RK Singh, Ambala Cantonment SDM Subhash Sihag, Joint Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gagandeep Singh and Irrigation Department officials reached the riverside to monitor the situation. An official said there was a report that nearly 11,000 cusec of water would reach Ambala Cantonment by 5:30 pm however till 6 pm only about 4,000 cusec of water was recorded. The situation is under control and announcements are being made asking residents to vacate their houses and shift to safer places. The administration has constituted two teams comprising officials of departments of irrigation, revenue and police and the Municipal Corporation. Rukmani Devi Hall, the Bankey Bihari temple, Aggarwal Dharmashala and the community centre in Subhash Nagar have been earmarked for people to shift to in case of any emergency. Besides, local gurdwaras have also been asked to make ample arrangements and allow people to stay on their premises in case of emergency. Health Minister Anil Vij told The Tribune, “The situation is under control. Officials have been asked to monitor the situation”. The Tangri, a seasonal river, has shrunk as illegal colonies have mushroomed on its riverbed, posing danger to the lives of people residing there. More than 1,700 families reside near the river. To keep a check on illegal colonies, the state government has notified the riverbed recently. In June, the administration had put up notices in the colonies stating that houses built on the riverbed violate rules and their owners would be responsible for any damage in case of floods. Meanwhile, residents refuse to shift from their houses and blame the administration and the government for the situation."

Jalandhar, August 19

Three persons were killed in a road accident that took place on the Goindwal road in Kapurthala today.

A 70-year-old man, his grand-daughter and a security guard of the Goindwal thermal plant lost their lives in the accident. The mishap took place near the Parvez Nagar bus stop in Kapurthala district when a speeding Bolero jeep hit an Activa scooter. The out-of-control jeep, in turn, rammed into a nearby tree.

Ranmeet Singh (35) and Gurvinder Singh (both security guards at the thermal plant) in the jeep were going from Kapurthala to the plant when they hit Rajwant Singh (70) and Kanumeet Kaur (14).

Rajwant Singh was taking his grand-daughter, a student of Class X, for tuition.

The impact of the accident was so much that the jeep hit a tree, uprooting it, making it fall 20 m, whereas the jeep itself fell farther away — at a distance of 100 metres. While one of the riders of the jeep and one of the riders of the Activa died on the spot, the second rider of the Activa – a girl – died while under treatment at a local hospital.

The driver of the jeep Gurvinder Singh, is serious. While Rajwant and Kanumeet were from Uccha Pind in Jalandhar, the duo riding the jeep were both residents of Tarn Taran.

SHO, Fattudingha police station, Parminder Singh, said, “The jeep driver could not control the vehicle due to which it hit the Activa and rammed into the tree, fatally injuring all the riders and claiming the lives of two on the spot. While the girl died on the way to a private hopistal in Jalandhar, the driver of the jeep is presently serious.”"
Indian-American among scientists to identify new potential breast cancer drug,"Houston, August 18

Scientists, including an Indian-American researcher, have identified a molecule that can help treat breast cancer, giving hope to patients who have become resistant to traditional therapies.

The first-in-class molecule shuts down oestrogen- sensitive breast cancer in a new way, researchers said.

First-in-class drugs are those that work by a unique mechanism - in this case a molecule that targets a protein on the oestrogen receptor of tumour cells.

The potential drug offers hope for patients whose breast cancer has become resistant to traditional therapies.

""This is a fundamentally different, new class of agents for oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer,"" said Ganesh Raj, professor at the University of Texas Southwestern (UT Southwestern) Simmons Cancer Center.

""Its unique mechanism of action overcomes the limitations of current therapies,"" Raj said.

All breast cancers are tested to determine if they require oestrogen to grow and about 80 per cent are found to be oestrogen-sensitive, researchers said.

These cancers can often be effectively treated with hormone therapy, such as tamoxifen, but as many as a third of these cancers eventually become resistant, they said.

The new compound is a potential highly effective, next- line treatment for these patients, said Raj.

Traditional hormonal drugs, such as tamoxifen, work by attaching to a molecule called the oestrogen receptor in cancer cells, preventing oestrogen from binding to the receptor, a necessary step for cancer cells to multiply.

However, the oestrogen receptor can mutate and change its shape over time so that the treatment drug no longer fits neatly with the receptor. When this happens, the cancer cells start multiplying again.

""There has been intense interest in developing drugs that block the ability of the oestrogen receptor - the prime target in most breast cancers - from interacting with the co- regulator proteins that cause a tumour's growth,"" said David Mangelsdorf, professor at UT Southwestern.

Blocking such ""protein-protein interactions"" has been a dream of cancer researchers for decades.

The drug works by blocking other molecules - proteins called co-factors - that also must attach to the oestrogen receptor for cancer cells to multiply.

The new molecule, dubbed ERX-11, mimics a peptide, or protein building block.

So far, it has been tested in mice and in cancer cells removed from patients and works well in both models, and there have been no signs of toxicity in the tests.

If successfully translated to a human therapy, another advantage of ERX-11 is that it could be taken orally by patients, rather than as an infusion.

The researchers are hoping to get a clinical trial under way in about a year. The notion of blocking protein co-factors has implications for treatment of other cancers as well. —PTI"
Umar steps up verbal attack on Arthur,"Karachi, August 19

Out-of-favour Pakistan batsman Umar Akmal has stepped up his verbal attack on chief coach Mickey Arthur despite being issued a show-cause notice by the country’s cricket board. Akmal today tweeted that “dummy” fitness tests were held in England before the Champions Trophy just to fail him and send him back home. “The tests were held to get me out of the team,” Akmal said. PCB has issued a strong-worded statement, condemning the reckless tweets made by Akmal with regards to his omission from the Champions Trophy squad. The statement said Akmal was given as many as seven chances to improve his fitness and match the standards of his teammates. “Arthur had placed Akmal in his white ball format plans and given him repeated chances for redemption, but he failed to achieve the required fitness level,” a PCB statement said. — PTI"
Now an artificial heart made of spider silk,"London

Researchers have developed cardiac muscle tissue made of spider silk, to investigate whether artificial silk protein could be suitable for engineering cardiac tissue.

Ischaemic diseases such as cardiac infarction leads to irreversible loss of cardiac muscle cells, which is the main cause of reduced cardiac functionality that affects the working of the heart.

According to the researchers at Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg (FAU) in Germany, silk could be the key to artificial cardiac tissue. Or, the protein that gives the silk its structure and mechanical stability called as fibroin.

For the study, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, the team investigated the suitability of the silk protein eADF4(?16) produced in the laboratory for the production of cardiac tissue.

The research involved applying a thin layer of the silk protein to a glass slide. The technique is based on the fact that cells with a negatively charged surface adhere to films made of the eADF4(?16) silk protein due to its positive charge.

The study focussed, in particular, on cardiac cell functionality. The researchers compared these cells to cells that they had applied to a film of fibronectin, which is similar to the natural environment of cardiac cells.

No functional differences between the two were observed.

The researchers were able to demonstrate, for instance, that factors responsible for hypertrophy -- enlargement of cardiac cells for instance in athletes and pregnant women -- also led to a growth in volume in the cardiac cells that had been cultured on a film of eADF4(?16).

The possibilities of printing artificial silk proteins using 3D printing technology therefore represent the first steps towards future methods for engineering functional cardiac tissue, the researchers noted.

Kerr makes history as US lead Europe by 3 pts





West Des Moines (USA), Aug 19 American Cristie Kerr made history as the United States retained a three-point lead at the Solheim Cup when they split the morning foursomes matches against Europe on Day 2 on Saturday. Both sides won two matches, leaving the US ahead — 7-1/2 to 4-1/2 — heading into the afternoon four-ball contests at Des Moines Golf & Country Club. The American duo of Kerr and Lexi Thompson got the US off to a winning start on Saturday morning, thrashing Carolina Masson and Jodi Ewart Shadoff 5&3, with Europe winning only one hole. In the process, the 39-year-old Kerr passed American captain Juli Inkster for the most points in US Solheim Cup history with 18.

With tonnes of debris swamping Malpa village in the wake of the August 14 landslides that killed five persons and left more than 20 missing, revival of the place and resumption of human habitation there looks nearly impossible, according to an official who took stock of the situationthere. “The huge volume of debri there is almost impossible to dispose of making human habitation in future extremely unlikely,” Ashish Chauhan, Chief Development Officer of Pithoragarh, said on his return from the affected village today.

Baby Clinic in Calcutta,"LAHORE, SUNDAY, AUGUST 19, 1917

SOME time ago Miss Webb, the Lady Superintendent of the Dufferin Hospital for Women, Calcutta, made arrangements to start a Baby Clinic as an experiment and invited women with new-born babies, to go to the clinic once a week to obtain expert advice about the treatment of children and also a free supply of good pure milk with a reward of 4 annas to poor women to compensate for the loss of time and labour it involved. Obviously the scheme failed as the women did not take advantage of this offer and the Health Officer of Calcutta has made a reference to this failure in explaining the rate of high infant mortality in the city. ""When women who have personally experienced the advantages of hospital treatment cannot be induced to bring their babies to a clinic, there is obviously very little hope of ever inducing women who have never seen the inside of a hospital to bring their babies."""
Our missing corporate conscience...,"Harish Khare

Most of us in India may not be much aware of the drama that has taken place in an American town called Charlottesville. This town recently became the staging ground for what the American media calls the “white supremacist violence.” Since the Civil War in the 1860s, the American society has always entertained a “red neck” fringe — white Americans who remained unreconciled to the very idea of giving the black Americans any kind of respect and equality. “KKK” — Ku Klux Klan — has been the most infamous organised expression of this bigotry. Donald Trump got himself elected President of the United States by deliberately pandering to this lingering white resentment. To this soft bigotry, he dangerously added the toxic slogan of “America First”— a xenophobic invitation to hold and blame the outsiders for the white Americans’ miseries and misfortunes. That was politics. And that is what all demagogic politicians all over the world do — appeal to our baser instincts, incite us to hate our neighbours. Once Trump got elected, it was widely hoped — inside and outside the United States — that he would sober down. Therefore, when Charlottesville happened, the expectation was that the American President would be unsparing in his condemnation of the white supremacist violence. Instead, he appeared to be siding with the violent goons. Expectedly, he was denounced by his political rivals as well as by most of the saner civil society groups. But it was the reaction of the business leaders in America that should be of interest to us here in India. Corporate America stood up to the American President and told him that it was unworthy of him to fail to denounce the violence. One corporate leader after another resigned, in protest, his seat on the President’s advisory councils; all that an embarrassed Trump could do was to disband those bodies. A typical reaction came from Jeff Immelt, chairman of General Electric; he had his company put out a statement criticising President Trump: “The President’s statements were deeply troubling...GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry, racism, and the white supremacist extremism that the country witnessed in Charlottesville.”

Bravo.

Can we imagine a similar forthright stand by any of our corporate leaders in defence of basic constitutional values? I am afraid, not. The reason is simple: our corporate houses have never practised clean businesses nor acquired an ethical voice that would enable them to stand up to the politician. Even the best of our so-called entrepreneurs are aware of their vulnerabilities — and, these vulnerabilities are self-inflicted because of their greed, dishonesty, and illegalities. Perhaps each Indian corporate leader is content to prefer expediency over ethics. No society can achieve genuine progress, peace or national glory if its business community does not become a site and a source for good moral conduct. The American corporate leaders are quick to realise that if the demagogues are allowed to have a run of the place, they would end up reopening the settled equations and arguments which underwrite the society’s compact and cohesion. Any genuine business leader in India ought to feel that he and his company have a stake in the rule of law, a lawful society, and a just and fair social order. And, that he has an obligation to stand up to any demagogue who threatens to introduce violence and venom in our society. ********ast Sunday, The Tribune focussed on the memories of Partition by way of observing the 70th year of our Independence. That has prompted very many readers to send in their own personal recollections of what happened to them or their loved ones in those trying days, immediately after August 15, 1947. Those were horrible, horrible days. The writ of the government on both sides of the border simply did not run. And, each family, each clan and each village was left to its own devices. A delirium of madness had swept over the land. What I find remarkable and reassuring in these communications from The Tribune readers is that each one of them is anxious to tell a tale of a good deed done to them by a neighbour or a friend or even by a total stranger of the other faith. Perhaps, the most touching tale is narrated by Mohinder Pratap ‘Chand’ who informs us that he has been a Tribune reader for 63 years. He is a much-honoured and much respected author in our region. It appears that in 2010, he had managed to visit his ancestral home near Lahore. He produced a booklet about his two-week stay and the warm hospitality he received in Pakistan. Chand sahib was kind enough to send me a copy of this booklet. He ends the book with a reference to eminent Pakistani writer Saqib Zirvi’s experience of the Partition. Zirvi recalled how a Sikh friend saved his life. It seemed a mob was chasing Zirvi and he took shelter in his friend Sardar Gurmukh Singh’s house. When the killers came hunting to Gurmukh Singh’s house, the good Sardar made Zirvi lie alongside his ailing wife and covered the two with a blanket. The marauders were invited to see how there was only the unwell wife. “His wife’s face was partially visible from the fringe of the blanket. Those cruel-hearted slayers could never have thought even in their dream that a non-Muslim, a Sikh would make such a unique sacrifice for a Muslim friend,” he remarks. Such tales are a reassuring reminder to everyone in both India and Pakistan to never again let the politicians instigate religious frenzy in pursuit of their lust for power. ********

T he stunningly beautiful book-cover arrests the eye. A scene of a snow-covered Bhimkali Temple at Sarahan in Himachal Pradesh brings alive the spiritual tranquillity of this magnificent place of worship. But what attracted me to legendary photographer Ashok Dilwali’s latest book was its title, So Said the Wise.

An extremely presumptuous title, I would say. Who is the ‘wise’ one? And, who gets to decide as to who is ‘wise.’ And this is a question that cannot be easily answered, certainly not in these turbulent times, when we are busy judging our national geniuses by new standards, and are rewriting our national history, and replacing our national icons. Ashok Dilwali is a master-photographer of the Himalayas. He has a perceptive eye and understands the camera’s creativity. And, in this book he has sought to blend the visual with inspirational voices. Without making any claims to being a historian or a philosopher or a political ideologue, he has put together a list of thinkers and social reformers who have given our civilisation its coherence and its spiritual energy. No one can quarrel with the list. Gautam Buddha. Meerabai. Pandita Ramabai. MG Ranade. Mirra Alfassa (“the Mother”). Chanakya. Sant Eknath. Rabindranath Tagore. Keshub Chandra Sen. Bulleh Shah. Thiruvalluvar. Swami Chinmayananda. Sivananda Saraswati. Nizamuddin Auliya. Jiddu Krishnamurti. Abdul Kalam Azad. Gopal Krishna Gokhale. S. Ramanujan. Osho. Moinuddin Chishti. Mirza Ghalib. Jyotirao G. Phule. Guru Nanak. Gandhi. Nehru. Periyar. Swami Prabhupada.

And, many more.

This simple compendium is a yet another reminder of how blessed this land of ours has been, how it has been enriched by the teachings and wisdom of these seers and gurus. This list gives us a glimpse of our composite culture and how the “wise” from each generation and each religion helped society find its way out of confusion and confrontation. A reader can open this brief book at any page and get a glimpse of the true Indian genius. Shree Narayan Guru, the saint-reformer, says: “Men may differ in their faiths, their languages and their modes of dressing; but there can be no evil in inter-dining and intermarriage, because all belong to the same kind of creation.” It is a welcome antidote to all the anger and all the animosity that is being sought to be injected in our body politic in the name of nationalism. ********

Protest wasn’t against Finance Minister: ZP member

Finance Minister Capt Abhimanyu was today shown black flags by some villagers, including women, at Titoli village in the district where he had gone to attend a blood donation camp. The irate villagers, who were protesting against non-release of youths arrested for violence during the Jat quota agitation in February last year, also heckled the minister’s cavalcade and raised slogans as he was departing from the venue. “Capt Abhimanyu had lost his house, but the (Jat) community lost 18 children during the agitation. He (Abhimanyu) is not withdrawing the cases registered against our youths, who are languishing in jails. We will continue to oppose him,” said Jaiveer Kundu, one of the protesters. Earlier, the minister inaugurated the blood donation camp organised by the Jai Ma Beriwali Welfare Trust and encouraged donors by affixing badges on their shirts and presenting certificates to them. Capt Abhimanyu, while talking to mediapersons, said the BJP government has rectified the situation arising due to poor financial management by the previous Congress regime in Haryana. “I am ready for an open discussion with any representative of the Opposition at any platform,” he added. Baba Kalidas, Rohtak Zila Parishad chairman Balraj Kundu, local BJP leaders Ram Avtar Balmiki, Dharambir Hooda and Sanjay Kundu were present.Rohtak Zila Parishad member Sanjay Kundu, who belongs to Titoli village, said that Capt Abhimanyu had come to the village on his invitation and the protest by a group of villagers was not against him. “They have some personal animosity against me and hence they wanted to disrupt the programme. However, other villagers did not allow them to do so,” Kundu said in a statement issued on Saturday evening. He said villagers extended a warm welcome to Capt Abhimanyu, who announced Rs 11 lakh for the Trust and financial support for the construction of a yagyashala in the village."

Muzaffarnagar, August 20

Mohammed Dilshad, 48, is nursing a broken spleen and a wounded leg at the district hospital here. On his lips are just these words- ""Kudrat ka karishma hai (it's a miracle of God)"".

A native of this Uttar Pradesh town, Dilshad frequently takes the Puri-Haridwar Utkal Express for Delhi where he works. On the fateful Saturday evening, he ended up being locked inside the S-2 coach -- the carriage that had climbed on to another during the accident at Khatauli.

""We were all hanging precariously in the carriage. Many of my fellow passengers suffered terrible injuries. All, I recall is that there was a very loud and continuous thud around 5.40 pm and then the bogie was swerved over another,"" he said.

The S-2 coach suffered such a massive impact that all its wheels came off and it ended up dangling on the pantry car, with its one end ramming the facade of a house nearby.

""The doors were crushed, so we went to the emergency windows and then, slowly, we all climbed down to the roof of the coach below and eventually to the ground,"" Dilshad told PTI.

Shariq Nasim, 32, says he gets nightmares and his head whirls. ""I got hit on my head. Also, my leg got broken. I can't even recall if I was in S-5 or S-6. Mere thought of the accident terrifies me,"" said the city resident, before being taken for a leg plaster at a district hospital.

Over 20 people have died in the tragic accident that took place in Khatauli town of the district. Scores of others were injured and sent to various hospitals here as well as in neighbouring districts.

""59 injured passengers were brought to our hospital yesterday. Four of them were in critical condition so we referred them to the Meerut Medical College and Hospital. As of now, 39 patients are left here. They are in stable condition,"" Chief Medical Superintendent of Muzaffarnagar District Hospital, Dr P K Agarwal told PTI.

""Three of these critical patients, and one more, were in a state of shock. We first normalised them before sending them to the other hospital,"" he said

Agarwal said six of the passengers were brought dead to the hospital. The colonial-era hospital has a strength of 175 beds.

A tad too sweet,"MOVIE REVIEW: BAREILLY KI BARFI

Nonika Singh

Ever since Anand L Rai invented patakha Tanu, which fit Kangana Ranaut like a glove, there has been a deluge of perky small-town female characters. So, Bitty (Kriti Sanon) of Bareilly Ki Barfi comes as no surprise. This daughter of a sweet shop owner is bold and vivacious, can break into a jig (break dance to be precise) at the slightest turn of music, smokes and drinks and has the courage to tell her suitors that she is no virgin. No wonder she can't find a suitable groom. After all girls like her, few and far between, are a ‘disaster.’

But before she decides to call it quits and run away from home, she stumbles upon a book Bareilly Ki Barfi that best describes a girl just like her with no value judgements attached to her behaviour which others, including her mother, call misdemeanors.

Thus begins her search for the author and director takes us on to the love path where identities are muddled and soon love has three facets, not just the visible Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti. If Kriti is just right for the exuberant Bitty and Khurrana is endearing and exasperating in turns as his character demands, Rajkummar Rao as the third angle and the underdog is brilliant. He gets even better when he transforms into the snazzy confident, almost brash guy. Only if he had some more screen time as well as something more (spoiler alert).

Nevertheless, for a considerable part the director keeps you invested in the story told simply as well as has you nibbling over the key question---who will get the girl? Fleetingly, the film reminds you of those delectable super fresh romances such as Sai Paranjpye’s Katha. But if those films skillfully and subtly delved into complexities and many shades of human nature, here the director decides to play super safe and love story ends the way you so hope and wish it won’t. The conflict resolution is a downer.

Thus Bareilly Ki Barfi, despite the surface gloss of rebellion, turns too sweet. If you like your love stories more sugar than spice be Bareilly’s guest. We would have preferred a sharper climax, the sparkle of which can otherwise be seen interspersed in-between and not just in Javed Akhtar’s witty voice-over that takes you enroute Bareilly ki galiyan, especially the Misra household that is peopled with few but animated characters and competent actors (Seema Pahwa and Pankaj Tripathi as parents). Dialogues such as Agar ladkiyan shakal dekhti to desh ke aadhe se zyaada ladke kunwaare hote have a zing. Indeed, Bareilly… has many delightful one-liners and amusing moments but the overall impact is not tantalizing enough to make it a wholesome fare one must bite into. Unless you have a sweet tooth…the saccharine-high barfi will leave you craving for more."

Srinagar, August 19

Almost a week after the killing of a Hizbul Mujahideen commander in Shopian, security forces carried out combing and search operations in at least 10 villages in the district to flush out militants. The cluster of villages that were searched on Saturday included Chakoora, Mantribug, Zaipora, Pratabpora, Takipora , Ranipora, Ratnipora, Dangam and Wangam. The joint teams of the Army, the police and the CRPF cordoned off these villages in the wee hours and house-to-house searches were carried to locate the militants. The villages that were searches in Shopian are bordering neighbouring Kulgam district and are considered the hotbed of the local militancy. However, neither any one was arrested nor any contact with militants was established during the nearly seven-hour long searches. “The searches were carried today in the villages which have been militant strongholds,” Superintendent of Police, Shopian, Ambarkar Shriram Dinka said. “There was no stone-throwing during the entire operation,” he said. On August 13, three militants, including Hizb operation chief Yasin Yatoo, alias Mehmood Ghaznavi, were killed in a gunfight in Shopian. It was the first militant causality in the district this year. Eight Army personnel, including two officers, have been killed by militants in Shopian this year. Since the killing of militant commander Burhan Wani in July last year, militants have consolidated themselves in Shopian and they have been frequently releasing videos on the social media.

Fund crunch may hit paddy procurement,"Distribution of dal, sugar, tea leaves put on hold for now

Chandigarh, August 19

The shortage of funds has hit the Food and Civil Supplies Department hard. The distribution of dal, sugar and tea leaves has been put on hold because of the inability of the Finance Department to release funds. Even the money for buying paddy cannot be obtained because of the crisis. The department needs Rs 1,600 crore immediately, but the Finance Department has expressed its inability to release the money now owing to a revenue deficit of Rs 1756.2 crore in the April-June first quarter. In spite of budgetary provisions of Rs 1,100 crore to fill the gap in cash credit limit (CCL — money sanctioned by banks to the government for buying a crop), and Rs 500 crore for providing sugar, dal and tea leaves to beneficiaries, the authorities have not released any money. As of date, other than wheat, no dal, sugar or tea leaves have been distributed. Wheat distributed to beneficiaries is from the funds released by the Union Government under the Food-for-All scheme. The department needs Rs 1,098 crore to settle the gap in the CCL sanctioned in the last season for paddy procurement. This year, because of a 10 per cent higher (expected) paddy production, the state needs around Rs 32,000 crore CCL. But this will be sanctioned by the consortium of banks led by State Bank of India only when they clear the previous year’s CCL, which has a gap of Rs 1,098 crore. KAP Sinha, Secretary, Food and Supplies Department, when contacted, said they were trying to arrange funds, while the CCL limit would be released in time by the RBI. Official sources say that the Food and Civil Supplies Department has held several meetings with the finance authorities, asking them to hurry up with the release of Rs 1,098 crore. With the farmers’ unrest over the delay in implementation of crop loan waiver and the continuing auction of their properties simmering, the government is keen on having a second smooth procurement of foodgrain."

Ludhiana, August 19

An important file in the controversial Grand Walk mall case, which remained in news recently, has gone missing from the Municipal Corporation records.

Strangely, the hearing of the particular case will also begin soon. Perturbed, the MC authorities are ready to get an FIR registered with the Sarabha Nagar police station.

Confirming the development, Municipal Corporation Commissioner Jaskiran Singh said: “One of the files regarding the submission of compounding fee by the owner is missing from the office records. We are getting all details. A complaint has already been lodged at the Sarabha Nagar police station, but no FIR has been registered so far.”

The particular case has already taken many twists and turns. Regarding the non-compoundable violation, the construction of the sixth floor in the mall, the MC building branch issued notice to the owners and three days’ time was given.

Minister of Local Bodies Navjot Singh Sidhu in a telephonic conversation with The Tribune said: “They gave notice without even informing me or taking me into confidence. For non-compoundable violation, they could have given a short notice of just about an hour or two because here demolition remains the only option. Instead, the building branch gave three-day notice to the violator. Enough time was provided to the owner of the Grand Walk mall so that he or others could move court to get stay orders. The building branch officials are deep in corruption. But this will not continue (corruption).”

Highly placed sources, however, said as soon as the staff/ officials of the building branch came to know about registering an FIR, about six persons reached Chandigarh to meet Minister Navjot Sidhu. It is learnt that Sidhu has given them a day’s time to locate the missing documents and provide the details of the entire case or be ready to face music (registration of FIR).

Another higher official in the Local Bodies Department said the land (for Grand Walk) was auctioned in 2009 and an agreement was signed between the MC and one person Sarabjit Singh (of Lawrence Road, Amritsar). The terms and conditions regarding the agreement were laid. Interestingly, in 2012, the sale deed of the particular land was executed in the name of one GS Majestic. For this, no permission was taken from the Municipal Corporation and it was total violation of the terms and condition. Not only this, an application for occupying the land after completion of the building was given to the MC again from Sarabjit Singh (the original allottee) in February 2017. “We fail to understand what the case is about, how rules and regulations were bent to favour someone and why the then MC officials/ staff, Department of Local Bodies remained mum over the issue?” he asked."

Panchkula, August 19

The presence of as many as 3,000 Dera followers outside the Panchkula district courts complex took the administration by surprise today.

The turnout was unexpected if inputs received by the police are to be believed.

The followers from different parts of Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh gathered outside the courts complex for the hearing in the murder case against Dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in the CBI court today. Senior police officials, including the DSPs, did not allow any Dera follower to enter the complex.

They latter had reached Panchkula in private buses, tractors, cars and also on Haryana Roadways buses from Ambala to Panchkula. Their vehicles were parked at different places in Sector 1.

After the hearing, they returned to their respective places, saying they would again come in large numbers on August 25, the day the special CBI court will pronounce its verdict in the rape case against the Dera chief.

Dalbir Singh, a follower, who had come from Ambala, said the Dera head had been implicated and that they would come again on August 25.

Another follower Ramesh said they would be present on both sides of road from Sirsa to Panchkula on the day. They would not tolerate anything against the Dera chief, he said. Meanwhile, sources in the Police Department claimed that many followers were still in the town.

Cops on alert

Panchkula Police Commissioner AS Chawla said they had received inputs about the presence of Dera followers. “Police personnel deployed outside the courts complex did not allow any follower to enter the premises,” he said. An anti-sabotage team with a sniffer dog and a bomb disposal squad will be deployed outside the court on Sunday. Also, the manpower will be increased.

DC meets officials

Panchkula DC Gauri Parashar Joshi met district administration officials. She asked them to cancel employees’ leave till August 30.

Hearing deferred

The CBI special court on Saturday deferred the hearing in the murder case against the Dera head to September 16.

No leave for cops, admn staff till Aug 31

Mohali: To avoid any untoward incident during the trial of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in Panchkula, the district administration and the Police Department have cancelled employees’ leave till August 31. A circular has been issued to all departments by Mohali Deputy Commissioner Gurpreet Kaur Sapra after receiving a communiqué from Mohali Senior Superintendent of Police Kuldeep Singh Chahal. “A part of the stretch from Lalru to Zirakpur leads to Panchkula, where a large number of followers are expected to turn up. We can’t take any chance and have asked the employees not to go on leave, except in case of an emergency,” said Sapra.

The Mohali SSP said: “On the hearing date, a large number of Dera followers are expected to show up.”

1,800 cops on duty

As many as 1,800 police personnel will be deployed on the route from Lalru to Zirakpur on the hearing date. Senior officials, anti-riot and quick-reaction teams will see to it that the situation does not go out of hand. As many as 400 personnel had been summoned from the Punjab Police and other district police headquarters.

Tips for becoming a co-applicant in home loan,"Ravindra Rao

A home is the most popular, and will be the most enduring of all earthly establishments, said the late great American magician, Channing Pollock, about his abode. A home is perhaps the most prized possession for most of us and aspirational in every sense; the best address, important neighbours and all facilities that we would ever need in life. That costs a small fortune in many Indian cities but if you have a robust source of income and an impressive credit score, such dreams can be realised without much strain. However, for those who do not fulfil the income criteria for a substantial loan, a simple way to hone your overall financial prowess is to borrow jointly with your spouse or someone who can be designated as a co-borrower. Let’s understand the basics of this advantageous concept.A co-borrower can be an immediate family member, salaried or self-employed, who is an Indian or even an NRI. Depending on their discretion, lending institutions can allow up to six co-applicants which may include spouse, siblings and blood relatives like parents. Nevertheless, married couples get the highest preference as banks even assign a longer loan repayment tenure subject to the retirement age of the older applicant.Prospects of a bigger loan at a better rate brighten when an applicant adds co-applicants with a good credit score and an independent income source. It helps lenders consider the joint income of the applicants to assess their repayment capacity. But banks may insist that all co-owners of the property must be the co-applicants as well.A joint home loan bestows tax deduction benefits for both co-applicants separately, provided they are co-owners of the property and each of them is contributing to the home loan repayment. As per existing provisions, principal repayments are eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act for up to a maximum limit of Rs 1.50 lakh. In the case of interest payments, there is a tax deduction available under Section 24 up to Rs 2 lakh if the property is self-occupied (If the property is let out, then the entire interest becomes eligible for tax deduction). For a joint home loan, this takes the combined limit to Rs 3 lakh under Section 80C and Rs 4 lakh under Section 24(b) – which helps reduce a significant burden on the family.

Advantage for married applicants

Few important tips can enhance the overall benefit to married applicants. A couple must mutually work out the ownership share between themselves as co-borrowers to optimise tax benefits; either this can be in the ratio of 50:50 for claiming deductions in equal proportion or 60:40 or 70:30 depending on which co-borrower falls into what tax bracket – if he or she has a higher income, a bigger share of the property can help avail greater benefits. The actual amount of tax benefit given to each co-applicant would be in proportion to their contribution in repayment of principal and interest. Thus, it is even possible for co-applicants to decide how much tax benefit they would want, and at what proportion, each applicant would pay. In case of a woman applicant, many lenders would provide a differentiated interest rate - usually a few basis points below the normal home loan rates. For this, the applicant must be the sole or joint owner of the property and an applicant or co-applicant for the home loan. Joint home loan applicants can make payments from a single or joint account by way of cheques or ECS. Some institutions even allow co-borrowers to share the number of EMIs between them, depending on which they could decide the number of EMI cheques to be issued by each applicant. One borrower can pay all instalments while the other can refund his or her share by way of cheque or fund transfer to that account.A key factor that decides one’s loan eligibility is the credit worthiness of borrowers. When one applies for a loan or credit, a lender seeks the individual’s credit risk, evaluated by a credit score maintained by agencies. A credit report is the holistic sum of the applicant’s financial dealings in every sphere of life, interpreted as a number that is critical for getting not just loans or other means of credit, but even to qualify for them (banks can judge not just the applicant’s primary eligibility but even his/her ability and propensity to repay). It is prudent to keep a check on the credit report/credit score of an applicant as well as a co-applicant; as lower scores could impact one’s chances of obtaining finance for a home.Besides home loan documents, individual details such as KYC (proof of identity and address), income and property documents are required to avail the housing loan. Detailed documentation helps a lender to decide faster and beneficially in your favour. Income documents can be supported by other assets created by the applicants to show their prudent financial behaviour. Though there would be multiple borrowers, the documentation process for joint home loans remains much like that of individual home loans. Despite its enormous benefits, one may avoid applying for a joint home loan if the credit score of the co-owner is low due to a poor credit history or if he/she is already repaying an ongoing loan that has consumed maximum loan eligibility or if he/she is intending to buy a bigger property in the future for self-occupancy or if he/she is about to retire.

Managing loan and finances

A joint home loan is not only about saving in terms of principal and interest payment to a great extent, but also about sharing an honorable and real responsibility towards a home. Many couples would agree that such a joint move has instilled a sense of discipline – especially financial prudence – in them where both partners feel proud for contributing towards mutual benefit. Yet, one must not take hasty decisions in terms of finalising a house or taking a huge loan (it may turn out expensive over the tenure with fewer benefits). Couples must undertake basic financial planning before committing to a huge monthly payout which may hamstring regular needs or individual desire to acquire something personal. As TS Elliot said, “Home is where one starts from.” Home loan is where one could learn much from – as co-borrowers.

Ludhiana, August 19

The Punjab Vigilance Bureau today filed a closure report on the alleged multi-crore City Centre scam, giving a clean chit to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, his son Raninder Singh and 30 other accused.

The defence counsel said a copy of the report would be given on September 2 — the next date of court hearing.

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)

The VB filed the report in the court of Sessions Judge Gurbir Singh on the basis of further investigation on the application of one of the accused, Chetan Gupta of New Delhi. It claimed that no wrong was done and figures of loss to the state exchequer were “imaginary”.

The closure report relies heavily on the findings of arbitrator Justice RC Lahoti (former Chief Justice of India) in favour of Delhi-based company Today Homes, stating there was no illegality and infirmity in the contract and that the company be compensated.

As per the report, several witnesses had been intimidated into giving a statement against the accused while several had claimed not to have made any statement to the VB in 2007. One such witness was BR Bajaj, former Principal Secretary, Local Bodies.

There was no deal, the report said, between Capt Amarinder and Today Homes, which had got the contract from the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) for the City Centre project comprising shopping malls, multiplexes, apartments, a helipad and a parking slot.

Evidence collected during further investigation made it clear that as CM, “Capt Amarinder only acted in public interest” with no malafide intention whatsoever.

“Rather, he had taken several steps as per the law for removing irregularities” after eliciting the opinion of the then Chief Secretary and Advocate General, the report says.

Neither the then LIT chairman, late Paramjit Singh Sibia, nor any member of the Trust had been found to have taken a bribe from Today Homes, as mentioned in the challan, the report claimed.

Capt Amarinder had ordered a probe into the alleged scam in September 2006 on the basis of media reports but after a change of government, an FIR was filed in March 2007. Subsequently, the VB booked 36 persons. The 106-page charge-sheet mentioned 152 witnesses. It was filed along with more than 10,000 documents on December 12, 2007. Although the prosecution concluded its arguments in 2012, no charges had been framed."

Ludhiana, August 19

An important file in the controversial Grand Walk mall case, which remained in news recently, has gone missing from the Municipal Corporation records.

Strangely, the hearing of the particular case will also begin soon. Perturbed, the MC authorities are ready to get an FIR registered with the Sarabha Nagar police station.

Confirming the development, Municipal Corporation Commissioner Jaskiran Singh said: “One of the files regarding the submission of compounding fee by the owner is missing from the office records. We are getting all details. A complaint has already been lodged at the Sarabha Nagar police station, but no FIR has been registered so far.”

The particular case has already taken many twists and turns. Regarding the non-compoundable violation, the construction of the sixth floor in the mall, the MC building branch issued notice to the owners and three days’ time was given.

Minister of Local Bodies Navjot Singh Sidhu in a telephonic conversation with The Tribune said: “They gave notice without even informing me or taking me into confidence. For non-compoundable violation, they could have given a short notice of just about an hour or two because here demolition remains the only option. Instead, the building branch gave three-day notice to the violator. Enough time was provided to the owner of the Grand Walk mall so that he or others could move court to get stay orders. The building branch officials are deep in corruption. But this will not continue (corruption).”

Highly placed sources, however, said as soon as the staff/ officials of the building branch came to know about registering an FIR, about six persons reached Chandigarh to meet Minister Navjot Sidhu. It is learnt that Sidhu has given them a day’s time to locate the missing documents and provide the details of the entire case or be ready to face music (registration of FIR).

Another higher official in the Local Bodies Department said the land (for Grand Walk) was auctioned in 2009 and an agreement was signed between the MC and one person Sarabjit Singh (of Lawrence Road, Amritsar). The terms and conditions regarding the agreement were laid. Interestingly, in 2012, the sale deed of the particular land was executed in the name of one GS Majestic.

Teacher dies after 'laughing too hard' in US,"Washington, August 20

A US schoolteacher died after she accidentally fell off a rooftop balcony while laughing during a vacation in Mexico, according to a media report.

Sharon Regoli Ciferno, 50, a teacher at Charles A Huston Middle School in the US state of Pennsylvania, was with her daughter at a friend's house in Mexico on Monday when she sat on a deck ledge that doubled as a bench.

""She started laughing very hard and when she put her head back she lost her balance and fell back,"" her brother David Regoli was quoted as saying by the Fox News.

""She suffered multiple injuries to her body and brain,"" he said.

""Alcohol was not a factor. The building code standards in Mexico are not as stringent as in the US. Unfortunately, there was no back on the deck,"" her brother said.

Regoli Ciferno was taken to a hospital where she died of her injuries. ""This was a tragic accident that has devastated our very close-knit family,"" he said.

The tragedy happened just as her students were getting ready to return to school from summer break.

Regoli Ciferno was married and a mother of two. — PTI"
City Centre scam: Khaira questions clean chit to Amarinder,"Says Capt, Badals playing 'friendly match'

Nikhil BhardwajTribune News ServiceLudhiana, August 20

Punjab’s Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Khaira has appealed to the Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court to take a suo moto notice of the clean chit given to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh in the City Centre scam case. Clean chit to Capt in City Centre scam He alleged that by giving a clean chit to the CM in the case indicated that the Badals and Capt were ""playing a friendly match"".

Lok Insaaf Party chief Simarjit Singh Bains said he would approach the high court to prevent court from accepting the closure of report in the case.

On a recent attack on three AAP workers in Ludhiana, Bains said if justice was not delivered in the case, all 22 MLAs of AAP will protest outside the office of the DGP, Punjab.

He said CP, Ludhiana, RN Dhoke, has assured him that culprits, in which key accused was Congress leader Hridypal Singh, would be arrested within 24 hours. Khaira alleged when Badals were in power they deliberately did not let the vigilance to file a chargesheet in court as they wanted to keep people in dark.

He alleged Badals had already given a clean chit to Capt Amarinder and they continued the drama of vigilance probe just to mislead the people of Punjab.

Khaira said in 2007 a case was registered and in the same year a 10,000-page chargesheet was filed in the court. He said the City Centre was not only the case where Badals acted “softly” against the Capt, but there were two more scams, including the Amritsar Improvement Trust case and a case involving an export-oriented firm, which too were not pursued seriously.

Khaira said in the three cases, the SAD concluded probe before leaving power under a secret agreement.” He alleged since Badals have favoured Capt, Capt too would act the same way against them and would not take action in their alleged involvement in “the transport loot, illegal mining and hotel business”.

He said: “The arrangement of Badals and Capt would prove costly for Punjab residents.”"
Warehousing on growth track,"REAL TALK - ANSHUL SINGHAL, CEO, EMBASSY INDUSTRIAL PARKS

In India, there are three to four classes of real estate — residential, commercial, hospitality and retail — which are the main focus areas of private developers. Globally, there is another class called industrial real estate. In fact, in Europe, US, Japan and China, industrial real estate is one of the largest classes of real estate. In India, it is still at a nascent stage. However, people have realised that with the implementation of GST, Make in India and policy-level changes in government, industrial real estate is now opening up to be a profitable sector and a lot of foreign investment is coming in. Tracking the growth opportunities that have emerged post the imlementation of GST The India Warehousing Show was organised recently. This year, Embassy Industrial Parks was associated as the Official VIP Partner of the show. Anshul Singhal, CEO, Embassy Industrial Parks, who was the keynote speaker at the Warehousing Leadership Summit talks about how the industrial segment is going to be the next big thing in Indian realty. Excerpts from an interaction: What are the growth prospects for the warehousing segment in India? India’s logistics and warehousing sector is poised for accelerated growth, led by GDP revival, ramp up in transport infrastructure, e-commerce penetration, the GST implementation, besides several other initiatives like ‘Make in India.’ Indian 3PL market is expected to grow with CAGR of 6 per cent over the next five years. The biggest indicator of its future is that the government of India plans to build multi-modal logistic parks across the country with an investment of Rs 33,000 crore in a bid to bring down costs incurred on logistics, it will also lay low the overall freight cost, reduce vehicular pollution and congestion, and will enable reduction of warehousing costs of the country. How is GST going to benefit this vertical? With the implementation of GST, domestic warehousing industry will see consolidation. Facilities will relocate to consumer-driven and transportation network areas from the current tax-friendly locations. We even expect sectors like e commerce, automotives, consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals; FMCG will own/lease larger warehouses at prime locations like Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Already the warehousing activity along the western corridor has moved towards a more systematic mode of operation leading to an inflow of more institutional funding and formal sources of capital. A recent survey about leading warehousing occupiers in the country revealed that consolidation and expansion will be the key theme driving warehousing demand in the region. This will result in increased demand for larger and better quality warehouses leading to the emergence of new warehousing hubs as well as expansion of the existing hubs. The survey also revealed that 30 per cent of respondents said that they will further expand their footprint in the warehousing market of Delhi-NCR alone in the post GST scenario. GST will ensure that India for the first time will be exposed to consolidated large space central warehousing parks instead of the current scattered poor quality stand alone spaces. Which are the key pockets of growth according to you? Modern warehousing facilities that allow for consolidation of distribution hubs will be a vital component in the growth story. Key markets obviously will be close to cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Pune — that are a mix of consumption centres and have active industrial presence. What are the major challenges that this segment is facing at the moment? Land acquisition is a major challenge for any real estate player. When we are looking at buying 50 acres to 200 acres of land and develop it, we hope for some reforms that make this process for industrial and warehousing purposes a lot easier. Second challenge is approvals. What we have today has definitely improved from what it was five years back and it has become friendlier in the Modi government but I think we have scope for improvement there. The policies can become more user friendly. The important thing to understand here is that the more time approvals take, the more the capital sits idle as we cannot start construction and generate revenues onto the land. What are your group’s expansion plans in this segment? Embassy Industrial Parks aims to build 20 million sq ft of industrial and warehousing space over the next five years across India at a total investment of about $1 billion. Being a forerunner in this sector, Embassy Industrial Park is also one of the few companies contributing to success of Make in India initiative and has signed three MoUs with the State governments. We have already signed lands which are at various stages of acquisition in Chennai, Delhi, Pune, Mumbai & NCR and we are actively working to acquire lands in Gujarat and Kolkata. We have a JV with Warburg Pincus with Warburg is investing Rs 1,000 crore of equity out of the total Rs 1,600 crore of equity investment. Which means we can raise another approximately Rs 4,000 crore as debt, our investment alone will be Rs 6,600 crore in this sector. This totals to $1 billion.

17 fall ill after chlorine gas leak,"Dehradun, August 18

Kids sleeping at the time of incident

Seventeen persons, including five children, were taken ill after chlorine gas leakage from a cylinder at a water works unit of Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan, a senior police official said. The police rushed to the spot immediately and threw the leaking cylinder into water to neutralise it, SP (City) Pradeep Kumar Rai told PTI.

Jasmine Singh in Amritsar/Tarn Taran

Maqboolpura (‘village of the widows’) and Patti seem to fight a difficult battle against rampant addiction. Lack of gainful employment, skill training and police’s inability to catch the big fish are the biggest challenge for the state govt

In Amritsar, those who returned from hell volunteer to help

Ajit Singh runs a private school in Maqboolpura, a village off Amritsar. He is well aware of the notoriety linked to this ‘village of the widows’ — a hated moniker that tells volumes about the drug epidemic gripping the state. “The stain is difficult to wash off our collective memory despite so many positive changes in the village. Education is a basic tool helping kids from addicts’ families to deal with the problem. We realize such children are the prime victims of the dangerous situation,” he says. He and his wife also offer vocational training to girl students so that they can earn a livelihood without being distracted to drugs. Has it all changed, even a bit? Outside the school in the narrow lanes as the day draws on, Ajit Singh’s picture of a changing Maqboolpura wears the same deserted look as it has over the past few years: a few children play with old rubber tyres, some old women sitting outside their houses, heads hanging low. But there are no young boys or men around. “Go to that corner of this lane,” says an elderly Deedar Singh, “you would sure find some young boys huddled together, having alcoohol (adulterated spirits).” Deedar says he lost his family members to drugs and has now decided to go on a hunger strike if the government doesn't listen to him. “I have seen more than 200 drug-related deaths in the last one year in this village of over 10,000 people,” says Deedar. Maqboolpura is a village where addicts take all kinds of drugs, but it is the adulterated synthetic alcohol substitute developed from chemicals that has emerged the most common addiction. During the Punjab election campaign in 2017, Aam Aadmi Party convener Arvind Kejriwal visited the village and promised to eradicate drug trafficking in “two months” if his party came to power. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, too, had promised the same in “just four-weeks.” What has happened to the promises? “If anything has changed in Maqboolpura, it is the price of drugs, which has shot up in a few months. Many young boys in this village have either died because of drug overdose or they are struggling with menial jobs, barely surviving with drugs,” says Deedar. He has no good words for either the school or any other effort in tackling the problem. His response is cynical: “School vich bache paddey ne, unha nu ki pta nashe da, thode wade ho lain do, fer dekhna (what do the school kids know of drugs? Let them grow up and then we will see).” Deedar says absence of job opportunities has lured youngsters into drugs. A small-scale industrial hub, Focal Point, is located near Maqboolpura. It has mainly cold storages and units engaged in manufacturing spray pumps. But Maqboolpura villagers have had no facility to train them in elementary skill development so that they can apply for jobs. “Training would-be workers is not our job. And even if we do have, who knows the person turns out to be an addict or a peddler. We cannot put our running business in danger,” says Pratap, a local businessman. Agriculture is out of the question as the villagers have no land holdings. “A private company official gives us a blank look when we tell him that we are from Malqboolpura. They look at us with suspicion,” says a villager. Deedar and several others cite deep-rooted politician-police nexus for the never-ending drug inflow. “You may see an odd naaka here, but you would never hear about the police having arrested a drug dealer. You will only hear about a poor addict getting caught with one gm chitta or for taking alcohol,” says Deedar. An elderly woman, Swaran Kaur, recently lost her son in an accident while he was ferrying drugs. “People fear the wrath of politicians and the cops. “Police do minute laugi, mainu andar sutan ch jey main drugs bare boleya (the police would take minutes to arrest me if I talk about drugs.” Advocate Kuljeet Singh Malawali, an RTI activist from Amritsar, says the drug situation continues to be very critical. For instance at Signal Basti, Ward No 1, Patti (Tarn Taran). Patti is located 45 km from Amritsar. As per the RTI filed by Mukhtiar Singh Patti, president, Anti Drugs Organization Punjab, Tarn Taran ranks number two in the category of highest drug addicts in Punjab with a total of 1,54,414 addicts in 2014-15. Mukhtiar Singh, a government employee, lost his 27-year-old son to drugs. He wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking to arrange a “shroud” of his son. “First the Akali’s denied rampant drug racket and substance abuse in Punjab and now the Congress is doing the same,” says Mukhtiar. As per his RTI, there are 39,54,168 people directly or indirectly affected by drug addiction in Punjab. “The number is increasing with each passing day.” He suggests that the death certificate should carry drug overdose in the column under 'reason for death.' He also insists on sharing the names and age of young boys who died from drug overdose recently. “Many among these victims are teenagers. Such information may prompt the authorities to be more serious about destroying the drug chain.” Navpreet Kaur, a resident of the Basti, has seen her husband selling off all household items to get drugs. She sees him using injections everyday but there is nothing she can do because the private de-addiction centres demand Rs 60,000 and more while the government-run are “totally useless.” Navpreet and many like her do not know how to handle this deadly problem. “If we inform the police about a drug peddler, instead of catching him, they pass on the information to the peddler who then threatens and harasses us,” says a woman. Residents in Maqboolpura and Patti hold police responsible for growing substance abuse. “The police side with the drug mafia and let them off the hook,” says Mukhtiar. Senior Superintendent of Police Darshan Singh Mann says people are coming forward to share information about drug availability. “It is because of people's support that we smashed the biggest drug racket in Tarn Taran, where peddlers crushed capsules and added heroin into them for sale.” Mann claims to have broken the backbone of drug mafia in Patti. “We have sealed four illegally running medical stores in Khemkaran. We have 89 cases registered under the NDPS Act. We recovered over 2kg heroin, 5.480kg opium, 250kg poppy husk, and 6,60,500 capsules and tablets (Alparax, and Taramadol). Ours is a continuous drive as we all know this problem cannot be rooted out in a day.”"

Chandigarh, August 19

Vikas Barala, accused of stalking and abducting 29-year-old Varnika Kundu, has not applied for bail. Reason: His father BJP chief Subhash Barala is not interested in getting him out and wants an interference-free probe. Vikas, who is now entitled to bail, was sent to judicial custody on August 12. The next hearing is scheduled for August 25. Vikas and his friend Ashish were re-arrested on August 9 and charged with attempted abduction under Section 365 of the Indian Penal Code, and also under Section 511, a provision that deals with attempt to commit an offence punishable with life or other imprisonment. Defence counsel Surya Prakash said, “Vikas was eager to apply for bail, but his father wasn’t.” The suspects reportedly chased Kundu in their car while she was driving home. They blocked her way with their vehicle in the early hours of August 5."

The state has not transferred the post-matric scholarship amount into the accounts of affected students

A compromise was reached, according to which students would pay the fee in instalments of Rs 5,000 each

The college, however, backed out, asking students to pay the entire amount to get admission

At least 27 Dalit students have been denied admission in BA (final year) course by the SGPC-run Guru Nanak College here. These students have failed to deposit their annual tuition fee because the state government has not transferred the post-matric scholarship amount into their accounts. Moga SDM Charandeep Singh, who is inquiring into the complaint of the students, said a compromise was reached between the college authorities and the students in his presence on August 4, according to which the students would pay the fee in instalments of Rs5,000 each. However, the college has backed out, asking the students to pay the entire amount to seek admission. Backed by the Punjab Students’ Union (PSU), the affected students have launched an agitation against the SGPC and the college. District Magistrate Dilraj Singh Sandhawalia had asked the SDM to sort out the issue, but the college authorities were adamant and not willing to cooperate with the administration. Mohan Singh Aulakh, district convener of the PSU, alleged the government had not released the scholarship to the affected students for the past over two years. The students alleged that the college was demanding Rs22,000 from them as annual tuition fee even though they were eligible under the post-matric scholarship scheme. “We belong to poor families and our parents can’t afford to pay the fee,” they said. The SDM has asked the social welfare officer to look into the matter."
"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India","The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour.

Surekha Kadapa-Bose

The working parents of a four-year-old girl were in for a shock when they approached a pediatrician to understand their child’s distracted behaviour. Since the child was unable to communicate, the doctor gave her crayons and paper and asked her to draw and play with colours. A few such sessions, and the doctor and her team realised that over and over again the child was highly agitated and was drawing pictures of the male genital.

“Fearing sexual abuse at the day care centre where the parents left the child everyday, we concluded the worst. However, luckily we found that she hadn’t been abused. The caretaker women at the day care centre would look at porn magazines and watch porn videos. Invariably, the child, too, was a mute spectator. This was adversely affecting the mind of the child,” said Dr Anjana Thandani, a Mumbai-based consultant pediatrician and national secretary of Growth, Development and Behavioural Pediatrics Academy.

Dr Thandani is among the many therapists who are opening up to the benefits of art therapy to counsel and treat patients, particularly children, with emotional and behavioural problems.

The world is witnessing traumatic times. Increasing crime on streets, insurgency, terrorism and domestic violence, including physical, verbal and sexual attacks are said to be the leading cause of behavioural problems. It’s here that art is coming to the rescue of those affected by such issues. From diagnosing to treating such persons, art is being used as a therapy.

To quote famous painter Pablo Picasso, “Art washes from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”

“Often children become mute spectators to these horrors and find it difficult to tackle emotions. As they are too young to understand what’s happening around them, they don’t know how to express their fears. This is when we use art therapy which includes visual, music, dance and, of course, painting. In case of children, painting comes very handy. It helps us to know what ails their mind’’, adds Dr Thandani.

Many children find it difficult to verbally communicate their emotions. In this sense, non-verbal communication such as writing, drawing or painting becomes an easy tool to express their fears.

Riddhi Doshi, a dance and movement and creative art therapy practitioner who works for Yuva, an NGO which mainly deals with children from slums on the outskirts of Mumbai, says, “Slum dwelling children are always under the constant threat of losing homes by demolition squads. The day after a demolition drive children are in a highly agitated mental state. We play music and teach them soft and slow movements of hands and legs to calm them down. There are children who can’t even name their body parts. They just say they have pain without knowing the name of the part that is aching. So we started teaching them to draw themselves and then taught them the names of different body parts with different colours”.

At the counselling centres, when given paint, crayons and paper, many children draw a black circle or square and splatter red paint on it. This is indicative of the violence that children face at home. At times, they draw a house with all windows and doors closed. This indicates oppression at home.

“When older schoolgoing children are asked to draw a solar system with plastic balls of different colours imagining themselves as the Sun, they invariably place the person whom they fear the most the farthest. If they name the last ball as father, mother, uncle, aunt or siblings, we know where the trouble lies,” explains Zill Botadkar, founder of the 15-year-old Lighthouse Centre, which has been using art to heal children, adolescents and adults in upmarket South Mumbai.

Once the problem is diagnosed, then the therapy of healing begins. From understanding the problem to complete healing, the process may take weeks, months, and sometimes years too. But the therapy has been found to be a useful communicator in self-expressing and increase coping skills to find a balanced life.

“I make art when I can’t gather the words to say”. These words by Australian author Nikki Rowe, who was diagnosed with a CRPS warrior (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), conclude the role that art can play in coming out of pain."
Hot spots around globe do not move as quickly as thought,"Washington

Through analysis of volcanic tracks, a team of researchers has found that hot spots like those that formed the Hawaiian Islands do not move as quickly as previously thought.

Hot spots are areas where magma pushes up from deep Earth to form volcanoes.

The results from Rice University in Houston, Texas revealed that groups of hot spots around the globe can be used to determine how fast tectonic plates move.

""Averaging the motions of hot-spot groups for individual plates avoids misfits in data due to noise,"" said a researcher Richard Gordon.

""The results allowed us to say that these hot-spot groups, relative to other hot-spot groups, are moving at about 4 millimeters or less a year,” he added.

They developed a method to analyse the relative motion of 56 hot spots grouped by tectonic plates.

They concluded that the hot-spot groups move slowly enough to be used as a global reference frame for how plates move relative to the deep mantle.

This confirmed the method is useful for viewing not only current plate motion but also plate motion in the geologic past.

Hot spots offer a window into the depths of Earth, as they mark the tops of mantle plumes that carry hot, buoyant rock from deep Earth to near the surface and produce volcanoes. These mantle plumes were once thought to be straight and stationary, but recent results suggested they can also shift laterally in the convective mantle over geological time.

A volcano forms on a tectonic plate above a mantle plume. As the plate moves, the plume gives birth to a series of volcanoes.

They compared the observed hot-spot tracks with their calculated global hot-spot trends and determined the motions of hot spots that would account for the differences they saw.

Their method demonstrated that most hot-spot groups appear to be fixed and the remainder appears to move slower than expected.

For seven of the 10 plates they analysed with the new method, average hot-spot motion measured was essentially zero, which countered findings from other studies that spots move as much as 33 millimeters a year.

Top speed for the remaining hot-spot groups — those beneath the Eurasia, Nubia and North America plates — was between 4 and 6 millimeters a year but could be as small as 1 millimeter per year. That's much slower than most plates move relative to the hot spots.

The study appears in journal of Geophysical Research Letters. — ANI"
Rocky rocks!,"MOVIE REVIEW - ROCKY MENTAL

Jasmine Singh

Action thriller may be a popular genre with Bollywood, but when it comes to Punjabi cinema, we have seen filmmakers attempting it only in bits and parts. And now here is a film, Rocky Mental, that takes on the genre full throttle, justifying action and thrill. Debutant director Vikram Thori’s film Rocky Mental gives Punjabi cinema a solid punch with its action. The story of the film, of an aspiring boxer caught on the wrong side of the fence, is though not a new thing for cine-goers, what, however, is new here is the treatment. The opening of the film goes overboard in establishing the character of Rocky, aka Parmish Verma, but soon enough everything fall in place. The dialogues of the film can make you pick up Punjabi’s shabd kosh, nevertheless they fit the bill. Rocky Mental is a quick watch, moving crisply from one scene to the other, justifying each action. It is the friendship angle in the film, which brings in moments of lightness and laughter. Though there are moments when the movie digresses from the main plot, next moment it immediately goes back on the right path for which the director Vikram Thori definitely needs a word of praise. Rocky Mental marks the debut of video director, Parmish Verma as an actor on silver screen. Undoubtedly, Parmish has nailed his character, he not looks dashing on screen, he can act with intensity and with warmth. Punjabi cinema can count on him for intense action and except some comedy too! Next up is the artiste, who showed us his acting skill in the Punjabi film, Qissa Panjab, Dheeraj Kumar. Dheeraj not only acts superbly, the artiste can be credited for giving the main character a strong support. Jagjeet Sandhu is yet another actor from Qissa Panjab and in Rocky Mental he shows his comic timing as well. Though we feel Jagjeet has far more talent then what we saw in Rocky Mental. Karanveer Khullar and Mahabir Bhullar and two other artistes have justified their roles. As for line producer, Darshan Aulakh, Punjabi cinema has got another bad man. Actress Tannu Kaur Gill makes her debut with Rocky Mental, and we bet the entertainment industry can register her name in the list of pretty faces, who can act too, if allowed. The film’s music is macho, strong and likeable. Sharry Mann’s track, Yaara, is an emotional song, reminding us of Jaane Nahi Dainge Tujhe from 3 Idiots. Rocky Mental does has its share of pull-down factors, but it is the action thrilling moments that attract major points, and then of course, we have Rocky (Parmish Verma), who rocks!

New Delhi, August 19

Apparently playing the infamous online game “Blue Whale Challenge”, a Class XI boy today tried to commit suicide and jumped from fourth floor.

The police have raised doubts that the boy tried to commit suicide while playing the “Blue Whale Challenge” game.

According to police sources, the boy has been identified as Kush (16), a resident of Ashok Vihar.

After noticing Kush in the pool of blood, he was rushed to Ganga Ram Hospital, where his condition is said to be critical.

The police have recovered Kush’s bathroom sleepers, specs and mobile phone from the spot.

Presently, the police are investigating his phone details. According to a senior police officer, the boy might be in depression that’s why he took such a harsh step.

According to one of Kush’s family members, earlier Kush was studying in some other school and he used to miss his old friends which could be the reason of his depression. The police are waiting for Kush to regain his consciousness so that they could record his statement.

The DCP (Northwest) said the police are investigating the incident of suicide attempt of 16-year-old student in Ashok Vihar. Inquiry conducted, so far, says that the role of “Blue Whale Challenge” game has not been established till now.”

The macabre game, which is said to have originated in Russia, is suspected to have claimed a teenager’s life in Mumbai recently. The Class IX student, apparently a participant in “Blue Whale Challenge”, jumped to his death from the fifth floor of a building in suburban Andheri in Mumbai on July 29.

The game starts by asking participants via social media to draw a whale on a piece of paper, then carve a whale figure on their body, and then gives other tasks such as watching horror movies alone or waking up at unearthly hours. The tasks also involve self-harm, while the final challenge is to commit suicide."

Amritsar, August 19

Demanding a complete loan waiver, members of the Kisan Sangharsh Committee (KSC) today held a dharna in front of the residence of Local Bodies Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu. The dharna, which continued for four hours, was lifted after the district administration assured the protesters of arranging their meeting with the CM. Addressing the protesters, farmer leader Sarwan Singh Pandher accused the CM of not meeting his major poll promise of writing off farmers’ loan. He claimed that the government had promised to waive the entire Rs 90,000-crore advances of farmers. Pandhar said waiving just Rs 2 lakh loan per farmer was a joke given the fact that the NDA-led Union Government waived Rs 2 lakh crore debt of 12 large corporate houses. He said farmers were forced to commit suicides as they did not receive adequate remuneration for their crops. He claimed that a study conducted by Punjab Agricultural University stated that the farmers spent Rs 2,050 for a quintal of paddy, but got just Rs 1,625 per quintal in return. Another farmer leader Gurbachan Chabba said other promises like a job to each household, drug-free state, Rs 2,500 monthly allowance to unemployed etc were also not implemented. The protesters lifted their dharna after Sidhu’s wife Dr Navjot Kaur Sidhu and officials of the district administration intervened. Earlier, police failed to prevent the protesters from going ahead as they crossed over the barricades installed 50 m away from the minister’s residence.Farmers under the banner of Kisan Sangharash Committee (KSC) staged a dharna outside the residence of local MLA Dr Dharambir Agnihotri. The MLA too sat in the dharna for some time and received the memorandum from the farmer’s body in order to pacify them. oc"

Our body needs vitamins to function efficiently. They play important roles in metabolism, immunity and digestion. The vitamins, our bodies need, can be broken down into two groups: fat-soluble vitamins and water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K rely on fats to be digested. A lack of healthy fats in the diet can lead to deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins. But if taken in excess these can be harmful to the body as these cannot be excreted easily. Water-soluble vitamins include vitamin B complex and the vitamin C. Excess intake is excreted in the urine. Because our bodies can’t store these vitamins, we need to take them regularly. The important minerals required by our body during different stages of life are calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium. A healthy balanced diet normally provides all these minerals in sufficient amount. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of various vitamins and minerals are far more than the actual requirements of our body. Because while calculating the RDAs, it is assumed that only a small percentage is actually absorbed from the food we eat. So we should make sure that our vitamin and mineral needs are met by making conditions favourable for maximum absorption of these vitamins and minerals by our digestive system. This way we can meet our daily needs by having lesser amount of these nutrients. The absorption can be maximised in the following way

Deworming

Parasitic infestations in the gastro-intestinal tract hinders the absorption of these nutrients. Even adults can have these infestations if they tend to eat out a lot because the food handlers or cooks could be the carriers. Hence, regular deworming is the must

Avoid wrong food combinations

Avoid eating palak and paneer together as the oxalate from palak combines with the calcium from paneer inhibiting calcium absorption from the gut. Do not drink tea or coffee with meals as the tannins present in both the tea and the coffee inhibit the absorption of iron from the food. Do not eat fruits along with the meals. The best time to eat fruits is on an empty stomach in morning, or as a snack between breakfast and lunch. This will ensure that all vitamins and minerals present in the food are fully absorbed. Do not drink water with meals as it dilutes the enzymes in the mouth and digestive tracks leading to in incomplete digestion and absorption of food.

Eating the right combinations

Lemon juice is a good source of vitamin C and should be taken with iron-rich foods such as spinach, quinoa, chia seeds, lentils, oatmeal and soybeans. Sulphur-rich foods like garlic and onion should always be added while cooking mutton, chicken because sulphur helps in the absorption of zinc and iron present in these foods.

Soaking and sprouting

Soaking and sprouting of cereals and pulses increases their vitamin C and B complex content and bioavailability. Eat probiotic and prebiotic foods To keep your gut healthy you need to maintain a healthy micro flora in your gut. Add the following foods in your diet which help to increase the healthy bacteria in your gut. These are prebiotic foods like banana, pineapple, garlic, onion, cucumber and flax seed. Probiotic foods like curd and yoghurt should also be added. Health and wellness is something which we all desire. Most people look for an easy way to attain it. The internet is flooded with information regarding the extra-ordinary role of some vitamins and minerals in achieving health and wellness. While the information may be true but it may not cater to individual needs. Since vitamins and mineral supplements are available over the counter and are considered relatively harmless without any side effects, more and more people fall prey to self medication with these supplements. However, these should always be taken under medical guidance and according to the specific needs of a particular person. The bottom line is that these supplements may be good for you but they do not substitute a balanced diet. Never start any such supplementation without consulting your doctor and in any case eating a healthy balanced diet is of utmost important. The writer is former Head, Department of Dietetics, PGIMER, Chandigarh

The right balance

Low fat milk 1 glass

1 glass Curd/ yoghurt 1 cup

1 cup Wheat flour 75gm

75gm Brown rice 50gm

50gm Spinach 100g

100g Fresh coriander, curry 25gm each

25gm each leaves and mint leaves

Tomato 50g

50g Almonds 30g

one Lemon one

one Raisins 30g

30g Rice flakes 30g

30g Jaggery 30g

30g Olive oil 30g

30g Egg one

Here is a list of certain foods if taken daily would provide the vitamins and minerals to our body in accordance with their recommended dietary allowances (vitamin A, E,K, B complex and vitamin C and minerals like calcium, magnesium, zinc and iron). For vitamin D half an hour exposure to sun is recommended.Add condiments and spices like red chillies, green chillies, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, turmeric and cardamom for additional minerals. You can also use millets like jowar, bajra and ragi in your daily diet."

Green is their kind,"As the pitfalls of global warming and jungles of concrete swarm our planet, some unknown, unsung heroes are quietly working to make our environment and world a little better

Eesha Duggal

There are two types of people in the world — the doers and the rest. Times when Mother Earth is witnessing abnormal climatic conditions and concrete jungles are fast replacing the green cover; some doers are working relentlessly to make things better for themselves, the rest and the rest of the rest. They are the ones who cared to stop by, smelled the roses, ploughed their own fields, then someone else's till their acts became contagious and sparked a movement. Here's to the everyday eco-heroes who refused to be non-participants, who started as one-man armies, faced the heat and still ushered in positive changes. Now in the latter part of their lives, these persons promise to leave the world a greener and finer place.

Jungle all the way

Jagat Singh Chaudhary, a BSF soldier, had just been home on leave in the fall of 1973 when a village woman, out to get fodder, fell down a mountain and sustained fatal injuries. The incident might have been unfortunate in every way, but it wasn't anything new for Kot Malla and many other villages of Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, where trekking to treacherous heights for essentials like water and fodder was part of every woman's daily routine.

The incident kept the young soldier up all night. The rest of his holidays were spent finding ways to improve the plight of the womenfolk of his village. Little did he know that what he would eventually start as an unfeigned attempt to provide respite to his fellow villagers would one day earn him a special name.

Chaudhary decided to grow plants on a wasteland his father owned, which was not just barren, but also uneven and stony. In 1980, he decided to hang up his boots and started cultivating these two barren hectares. Since no water was available in the vicinity, Jagat would walk 3 km daily, carrying water pots on his shoulders. His unbridled enthusiasm was infectious. Many others were inspired to go the ‘Jungli ‘way. Jungli was the name villagers gave the retired soldier.

After turning an unyielding land into a jungle of mixed plants, Jungli started planting cash crops such as ginger, turmeric, pulses, vegetables and herbs, which not only benefited the environment, but also provided livelihood to people.

Suman Saurabh, a Delhi university student, made Jungli’s work the focus of his post-graduation thesis. “There are very few people who're doing the real work. I came to know about Jagat sir from my professor. A visit to his jungle in Rudraprayag was so inspirational that I decided to study it further,” maintains Suman.

In 2007, Chaudhary was invited by HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, to develop a model forest on the campus, which he did till 2010.

He’s been undertaking plantation activities using wood, stone and pit technology. Now 70, ‘Jungli’ says he wants to save the future generations from the ill-effects of environment change; that’s why all the efforts.

Chamba's Chipko campaigner

Sunderlal Bahuguna’s Chipko Movement of 1981 offered meaning and purpose to many people across the country. Though working for the cause of environment since 1973, the movement marked an important event in the life of Kulbhushan Upmanyu of Kamla village in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, who marched from Kashmir to Kohima as part of the movement.

After school, Upmanyu decided to cultivate a piece of land in his village. A small field could not contain this young man’s dream, who refused to turn a blind eye to the problems his fellow villagers faced. Soon, he formed a development group with other villagers in 1973, where they addressed issues of villagers without any government help. He started working towards making the village self-sustainable.

What Bahuguna’s movement gave Upmanyu was a reason to concentrate on forests. He soon became a frontline campaigner in spreading awareness on forest conservation. That time, pine and eucalyptus plantation was under way on a large scale in Himachal, a dangerous practice which was set to jeopardise the ecosystem of the region and put villages in a major fodder crisis. Upmanyu stood up against the destructive move and launched a campaign. His consistent efforts bore fruit and after a seven-year fight, eucalyptus plantation was banned on the government land across the state and pine plantation was majorly discouraged. Owing to his endeavours to protect forests in the years to follow, oaks and rhododendron were declared protected in Himachal.

“It's important to focus on two things — plantation and systematic waste disposal. In plantation, we have to bring in more multi-purpose species and avoid pine and eucalyptus. There's also a need to learn the scientific ways of garbage disposal. The authorities should adopt the European model of waste disposal, which almost eliminates the chances of pollution,” says Upmanyu.

“I have always been interested in forestry. About five-six years ago, I met Upmanyu ji and joined him. He's been working for the preservation of forests for decades and his contribution is inspirational,” says Ranjeet of Chamba.

For many years, Upmanyu has been running an NGO — Himalaya Bachao Samiti. He now usually takes up advocacy work, but that, by no means, stops him from daily escapades into the wild.

The eco-warrior from Marathaland

When Ravi Purandre landed in India after spending the prime years of his life in the Gulf, he threw away his passport to purposely banish the temptation to travel any further.

Besides the warmth and love of his family, returning home to Pune also meant starting anew and finding a job. While still looking for one, he would unpremeditatedly wander off to Hanuman Tekdi — a bleak and lifeless hill, which had long been a haven for gamblers and drunkards.

The year was 1999, the hill was barren and Purandre had an idea whose time had come. He wanted to make Hanuman Tekdi green. He started planting saplings on the hill. Soon he met Srikant Paranjpe, who had already been working in this direction. “Together we started planting saplings and making trenches to harvest rainwater,” says Purandre, as he recalls the onset of the journey.

“One day, I saw NCC cadets practising for the RD parade at the Symbiosis College ground. When you have an unwavering commitment to your work, it's almost impossible not to connect it with everything you see. So yes, I saw these spirited children sweating it out and realised there was little that could match their verve and vibrancy. I wanted to rope in children and bring them to the hill for helping us. But above all, I believed that we, adults, had a responsibility that ran deeper than our subjective goals. It is not only wise, but also indispensable to inculcate regard and respect for nature in our young ones,” he asserts.

Pune schools and colleges, too, realised there was a wide scope for EVS activities at the once insipid Hanuman Tekdi. “We'd have youngsters working, laughing and eating together all day. It never felt like work,” says Purandre.

All along, the facelift of the hill was a matter inspiring enough to pique the curiosity of Pune residents, who now started dotting the hill for their walk.

In 2004, his group started getting support from the Pune Municipal Corporation.

“Moving ahead, we started making coco peat using a shredder, which I, being a mechanical engineer, designed myself. Once crushed, coco peat is used for mulching. It retains moisture like nothing else. A complete waste for the city, coconut shells were a treasure for our plants,” explains an innovative Purandre.

Pune had been facing a problem of leaf litter for a long time. Purandre came to the rescue, yet again. “Two years ago, we created six tonnes of best-quality compost using leaf litter, putting an end to the problem. Our target is to make 30 tonne compost by the end of this year and I am confident that we'll find the first-of- its-kind leaf shredding solution in India,” he asserts.

Eighteen years have passed since Purandre and his team started rainwater harvesting and plantation on the rocky Hanuman Tekdi. Today, the hill is unrecognisable with green cover over 60 acres. Three heart attacks and a bypass surgery has failed to shake Purandre's resolve. Every morning, he walks up the hill, his steps hard to match, while children from nearby schools flock the area to assist him. “Is it work?” It’s not, they know."

Indian-origin Briton hailed as hero for comforting Spain attack victim,"London, August 20

A 44-year-old Briton, believed to be of Indian-origin, is being hailed as a hero after he risked his life to comfort a young victim of the terror attack in Spain in which a van ploughed into pedestrians, media reports said.

Harry Athwal, from Birmingham, had been holidaying in Spain last week when the attackers drove down Las Ramblas, Barcelona, at speed, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 other.

Without considering his own safety, Athwal ran from the first floor restaurant where he was dining to the pavement and cradled a young boy who had been struck by the van, The Mirror reported.

He was seen comforting the boy at the site of the attack with a photo of them going viral as a terrible symbol of the destruction wrought by extremists on the city's freedom.

Athwal ran up to the boy as the terrorist's van swerved mindlessly past, despite the bodies being thrown high in the air and cries from police to stay back for his own safety.

Later, at a hotel, recovering from the harrowing experience, Athwal told the daily that he cast aside all thoughts for his own safety in that moment because the boy suddenly became in his eyes, his own son.

As such, he could not leave him alone to suffer, or to be mowed down again by the terrorists should they reverse callously back down the street.

""He was unconscious, his leg was bent the wrong way, there was blood coming out of his head, I knew it was more than blood. I was checking for a pulse and he didn't have one,"" Athwal said.

""I put my hand on his back and I thought he had gone. I was stroking his hair and in floods of tears but I stayed with him, I sat there because I was not going to leave this child in the middle of the road,"" he said.

""The police were telling me to move but I would not leave him. All the time I was thinking the terrorists could come back but I was not leaving that child. To me, he looked like my own son. He was my son's age, seven or eight. I just ran my hands through his hair, it was about comforting him,"" Athwal added.

The project manager, who lives with his wife Harjinder and sons Diernn, aged 19, and Khye, 8, also told the daily of how he had not even planned to visit Barcelona last week.

He visited with his own family, including his son, Khye, to celebrate the eight-year-old's birthday earlier this month.

But when his sister invited him to join her and friends in a spontaneous trip he agreed.

The group could not check into their rooms straight away when they arrived on Thursday, so decided to have a late lunch on Las Ramblas.

They nearly ate down the middle of the pedestrianised street, exactly in the terrorist's path, but a persuasive waiter luckily tempted them to try his restaurant on a first floor balcony. It was from there they watched the horrifying killing spree unfurl.

Jalandhar, August 19

Three persons were killed in a road accident that took place on the Goindwal road in Kapurthala today.

A 70-year-old man, his grand-daughter and a security guard of the Goindwal thermal plant lost their lives in the accident. The mishap took place near the Parvez Nagar bus stop in Kapurthala district when a speeding Bolero jeep hit an Activa scooter. The out-of-control jeep, in turn, rammed into a nearby tree.

Ranmeet Singh (35) and Gurvinder Singh (both security guards at the thermal plant) in the jeep were going from Kapurthala to the plant when they hit Rajwant Singh (70) and Kanumeet Kaur (14).

Rajwant Singh was taking his grand-daughter, a student of Class X, for tuition.

The impact of the accident was so much that the jeep hit a tree, uprooting it, making it fall 20 m, whereas the jeep itself fell farther away — at a distance of 100 metres. While one of the riders of the jeep and one of the riders of the Activa died on the spot, the second rider of the Activa – a girl – died while under treatment at a local hospital.

The driver of the jeep Gurvinder Singh, is serious. While Rajwant and Kanumeet were from Uccha Pind in Jalandhar, the duo riding the jeep were both residents of Tarn Taran.

SHO, Fattudingha police station, Parminder Singh, said, “The jeep driver could not control the vehicle due to which it hit the Activa and rammed into the tree, fatally injuring all the riders and claiming the lives of two on the spot. While the girl died on the way to a private hopistal in Jalandhar, the driver of the jeep is presently serious.”"
Inquiry against teachers for ‘inciting protests’ stirs row,"Balwant Garg

Tribune News Service

Faridkot, August 19

The start of an inquiry against two government schoolteachers here for the alleged offence of inciting protests against the state government has stirred up a controversy. On the directions of state project director, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), the district education officer at Faridkot has started a probe against Sukhwinder Singh Sukhi, a primary schoolteacher and district president of Democratic Teachers’ Front, and Gagan Pawa, district president, RMSA Teachers’ Union. It has been alleged that the inquiry against the teachers has been started on the demand of the Faridkot police. After increasing incidents of theft in Sadiq town of Faridkot and the police failing to solve these cases, a public protest was organised against the police at Sadiq some days back. It has been alleged that two government school teachers also participated in the protest and incited the people to organise the protest dharna. Sukhi of Sadiq town claimed that like other residents of the town, he took part in the public protest against the police. Amandeep Singh, SHO, Sadiq, denied he had complained against any individual after the dharna. “But the language of the two teachers in their speeches was derogatory and targeted the police. We don’t expect a government employee to use such language against his government,” said the SHO. The teachers said the inquiry was an attempt to gag them and it is tantamount to the “misuse and misapplication of the sedition law”. “Besides being government employees, we are common citizens. We face problems like everyone else. So, we have the right to protest,” said Sukhi."

Climate change is not merely a much talked about subject anymore. It has started manifesting itself rather cruelly. Unseasonal heavy rains and floods are no longer abnormal. Every year, several parts of the country face unprecedented rain that causes mayhem in peoples’ lives. The constant lash of rain causes floods in several regions of India causing numerous deaths, health hazards, damage to automobiles and property.

Be prepared

While natural calamities are unpredictable and unavoidable, it is imperative that we keep ourselves prepared for such eventualities with effective loss-minimisation measures. However, there could still be financial losses due to damage to property which cannot be avoided altogether. Insurance provides effective solution in terms of mitigating such losses by providing adequate compensation.

Property, motor insurance

While life and health insurance covers are vital for every human being, it is essential to include property and motor insurance as an integral component of your financial planning.

Few things in life matter as much to us, as our home does. Any damage to this can cause financial as well as emotional setback. While emotional setback is in the realm of the mind, only an appropriate insurance for property can safeguard one from financial setback. Apart from the building itself, the contents and other valuables in the house can also be protected through a home insurance cover. Usually, property insurance provides coverage against natural calamities such as fire, explosion and implosion, earthquake, lightning, storm, cyclone, tempest, tornado, hurricane, flood and inundation, subsidence, landslides and rockslides.

Property/home insurance policies are not solutions for natural calamities alone. They offer compensation for losses arising out of a number of other eventualities. They provide coverage against fire, burglary/housebreaking and natural calamities, losses or damages to domestic and electronic appliances and portable equipment, such as laptops, liabilities like tenants’ legal liability, domestic workers compensation and public liability.

During floods, automobiles are partially or completely submerged in water and citizens struggle with ways to recover their vehicle.

Innovative solutions

People in flood-prone areas find it difficult to get their cars towed away and delivered to workshops and dealers. Additionally, they are also charged higher parking fee by dealers (approx. Rs 11,000) and even higher by recovery van dealers just to get their cars towed away to a garage or workshop.

These are times when insurers stretch themselves to offer timely and innovative solutions to mitigate the miseries of the customer. Insurers not only provide financial support for repairing your car but also can help you with valuable tips to avoid further aggravation of the loss or damage to the car.

Add-on covers

What is important is that you should not delay reporting your vehicle to the nearest workshop. The list of workshops can be availed from your insurer itself. It is advisable to purchase additional protection by way of add-on insurance covers, which can be added to your current policy at minimal cost. Add-on covers like engine protector/hydrostatic lock cover will cover you against losses to engine due to water ingression.

Right insurance cover

To buy the right insurance policies to cover your property and vehicle, especially during natural calamities, you need to evaluate various policies available in the market before signing on the dotted line. Gather all information on the policy and the insurer to understand their reputation in the market, particularly the speed of claim settlement. Be aware of the inclusions and exclusions of the policy so that you can have an appropriate mix of all that you require. Inexpensive covers may leave out some key coverage that is crucial for full protection. Look for available insurance riders. The insurance company that you approach may be able to offer you extra coverage especially for valuable items like jewellery.

Time to take a call

Timing, too, is important when it comes to disaster insurance. It is important that you may not be given a cover against a natural disaster when one is in the offing. Always remember to read the contents of the insurance policy. Do ensure that you purchase the policy from an insurer with a good claim settlement record. Think about the security and amity that the insurance protection will offer.

Alleged Inflammatory Speeches,"LAHORE, SUNDAY, AUGUST 19, 1917

IT will be remembered that Lord Ronaldshay recently explained that his order for prohibiting the Calcutta Town Hall meeting was due to his anticipation, right or wrong, that inflammatory speeches would be made. This explanation casts an undeserved aspersion on public leaders who have never once been proved to have made or even accused of making inflammatory speeches. The Governor of Bengal was, therefore, not justified in imagining that responsible public men, who convened the meeting in question, would do anything unlawful. It at any time the speakers at a meeting made objectionable speeches, it is open to the authorities to prosecute the men and prove their offence in a law court, instead of judging the same upon one-sided representation."

Doda, August 19

After a long wait of nearly a year, the work on the replacement of damaged wooden planks has begun on the Bhandarkote bridge in the mountainous Kishtwar district.

Situated just 10 km away from the district headquarters, the bridge was built on the Chenab river in Bhandarkot area of the district around 40 years ago. It provides connectivity to 60 per cent of the population of Kishtwar district.

The Tribune highlighted the poor condition of the bridge in its July 27 edition, after which the government swung into action and started the repair work. The authorities have also replaced the broken wooden logs.

Ajaz Ahmed Karaipak, a local resident said, “After the poor condition of the bridge was highlighted in The Tribune, the government immediately started the repair work and replaced the rotten wooden planks. Minister of State for Transport Sunil Sharma, too, visited the spot a few days ago to take stock of the situation.”

“We have been demanding a new, motorable bridge for the past one decade due to the increased load of vehicles in this area which connects two subdivisions,” he added.

Public Works Department (PWD) Executive Engineer, Kishtwar, Mohinder Sen said, “We have replaced the damaged planks from the bridge but the national highway from Batote to Kishtwar is under the National Highway Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited and they have handed it over to some other agency for further work.”"

LONDON: A 12-year-old Indian-origin boy, believed to be having an IQ higher than Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, has been crowned as the UK's 'Child Genius' in a popular television quiz competition.

[ + read story ]

London, August 20

A 12-year-old Indian-origin boy, believed to be having an IQ higher than Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, has been crowned as the UK's 'Child Genius' in a popular television quiz competition.

Rahul Doshi, who a few days a back became an overnight sensation after answering all questions correctly in some of the earlier rounds, won the Channel 4 show 'Child Genius' by beating his nine-year-old opponent Ronan 10-4 in the programme's finale last night.

The schoolboy from north London clinched the title by answering a question on 19th Century artists William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais.

""It didn't sink in straight away, but it was really nice,"" Rahul said after winning the title.

In the final, Rahul impressed with knowledge of his chosen subject — Edward Jenner's medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England.

""I was bursting with pride,"" said his father Minesh, an IT manager who had entered his son into the competition.

The final followed an intense competition — aired through the week — which saw the candidates showing off their maths, English, spelling and history skills as well as memory powers.

Rahul had been one of the favourites throughout, after scoring very highly in previous rounds — and even bagging a full house in the very first round of the series.

He had captured the imagination of audiences during the competition after he correctly memorised the order of a pack of cards.

Rahul, whose ambition is to become a financial adviser, had revealed his strategy for the final as: ""The key is to block out everything else and remain calm. So just focus on your goal. Mine was to answer as many questions as I could correctly and that helped me stay calm and do quite well in the early stages.""

Rahul has an IQ of 162, which is believed to be higher than the likes of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, and qualifies him to be a member of Mensa club — the largest and oldest high IQ society in the world.

He was cheered on by father Minesh and pharmacist mother Komal during the show.

His father attracted some social media fury for laughing at a wrong answer given by his son's closest rival, Ronan, in a tense finale.

""#ChildGenius an adult laughing at children getting a question wrong shocking behaviour. Shame on you Rahul's father,"" read one of the comments on Twitter.

But Minesh Doshi had been very vocal about his competitive side throughout the competition.

He had previously said: ""We are here to win. There's no two ways about that"".

Qatar files complaint over Saudi threat to passenger flights,"Doha, August 20

Qatar has filed a complaint with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) against Saudi Arabia's threat of shooting down Qatari passenger flights, the media reported on Sunday.

The complaint criticised a TV report of Saudi Arabia, which Qatar described as ""attempts to terrorise travelers"" flying with Qatari national flag carrier, Qatar's news agency (QNA) reported.

Al Arabiya TV, based in Dubai, aired a TV report that claimed ""right of the siege countries to shoot down any Qatar Airways passenger aircraft"" if it flew into their airspace, containing an animation of downing of a Qatari Airways passenger plane, the QNA said.

The report constitutes a clear and serious violation of international treaties and conventions, particularly the 1944 Chicago Convention, the international air traffic service agreement and international air law, Qatar said, according to the QNA.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt imposed a land, sea and air blockade on Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting extremism, which Qatar had denied, Xinhua news agency reported.

The ICAO is a specialised agency of the UN, which codifies the principles and techniques of international air navigation. — IANS"
City Centre scam that never was?,"Jupinderjit Singh

Chandigarh, August 19

The Vigilance probe into the City Centre scam began in September 2006. A case was registered in April 2007 during the Akali-BJP rule

In the second term of the Akali-BJP regime between 2007 and 2012, the scam was not much talked about, so much so that the Ludhiana court did not issue a chargesheet against the accused all these years

In March this year, days before the election results, the VB submitted an application in the Ludhiana court saying it wanted to review the earlier investigation as new evidence has cropped up

With the Vigilance Bureau filing a closure report today in the alleged Rs1,144-crore Ludhiana City Centre scam, absolving Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and others of charges of corruption, the scam has come a full circle 11 years after it rocked the state. The scam will go down in the annals of history as a unique case that led to change in fortunes of top politicians of Punjab, besides making and marring career of many investigating police officials. The scam is unique in the sense that its contours took a drastic turn with the change in government thrice since it first came to light in September 2006. It had led to change of government in 2007 when Akalis stormed back to power and a bitter fight and vendetta politics between Capt Amarinder and Akali Dal patron Parkash Singh Badal took a turn for the worse. Billed as a dream project of Capt Amarinder during his chief ministership in 2002-2007, the city centre project included developing a multiplex, a mall, leisure parks and other commercial hubs with a rooftop helipad on 25 acres in Ludhiana. In those times, malls had just started coming up in the state and such a big project, including different commercial and entertainment facilities, was unheard of. The Vigilance probe began in September 2006, but the FIR was registered in April 2007 during the Akali-BJP rule. Later, in the second term of the Akali-BJP regime between 2007 and 2012, the scam was not much talked about, so much so that the Ludhiana court did not issue a chargesheet against the accused all these years. In March this year, days before the election results, the Vigilance Bureau submitted an application in the Ludhiana court saying it wanted to review the earlier investigation submitted in the court as new evidence has cropped up. Now, barely five months later, the Vigilance concluded that there was no scam.The cancellation report filed by Vigilance Bureau is along the expected lines. How could they have proceeded against their own CM? He is in charge of the Home Department and the VB falls under it."

A Gentleman Cadet of the Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun, Deepak Sharma (22) of Bathinda, reportedly died of exhaustion during a 10-km cross-country race, a regular feature of the IMA training, on Friday. Six other cadets collapsed too. At 2 pm, the cadet fainted in Badshahi Bagh area neighbouring UP’s Saharanpur district, a few kilometres from the final destination. He was administered first-aid. As his condition deteriorated, he was rushed to the nearest Lehman Hospital in Vikasnagar where doctors declared him ‘brought dead’.The body was sent to Coronation Hospital, Dehradun, for postmortem. The status of the other six cadets could not be ascertained, but an officer claimed they were not in the Military Hospital this morning. The Army has ordered a court of inquiry to ascertain facts and fix responsibility. The incident turns focus on the level of fitness of cadets as well as the training methods and conduct of instructors. In Bathinda, the deceased’s brother-in-law, Dr Rajiv Kapila, claimed Deepak was physically fit and could not have collapsed. “His camp started on August 14. A day earlier, he sounded cheerful over the phone.” Deepak had joined the IMA in January after completing studies at GNDU. — TNS"
Millions of Americans to gaze upon Monday's once-in-a-lifetime eclipse,"Los Angeles, August 20

Twilight will fall at midday on Monday, stars will glimmer and birds will roost in an eerie stillness as millions of Americans and visitors witness the first total solar eclipse to traverse the United States from coast to coast in 99 years.

The sight of the moon's shadow passing directly in front of the sun, blotting out all but the halo-like solar corona, may draw the largest live audience for a celestial event in human history. When those watching via broadcast and online media are factored into the mix, the spectacle will likely smash records.

""It will certainly be the most observed total eclipse in history,"" astronomer Rick Fienberg of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) said last week.

The eclipse begins its cross-country trajectory over the Pacific Coast of Oregon in late morning. It will reach South Carolina's Atlantic shore some 90 minutes later.

The total eclipse of the sun is considered one of the most spell-binding phenomena in nature but it rarely occurs over a wide swath of land, let alone one of the world's most heavily populated countries at the height of summer.

In terms of audience potential, it is hard to top the United States, with its mobile and affluent population, even though the direct path is mostly over rural areas, towns and small cities.

The largest is Nashville, Tennessee, a city of 660,000 residents.

Even so the advent of social media and inexpensive high-tech optics have boosted public awareness, assuring what many US experts predict will be unprecedented viewership for the so-called ""Great American Eclipse.""

Some might take issue with that prediction, citing a solar eclipse visible over parts of India, Nepal, Bangladesh and central China in July 2009. National Geographic estimated 30 million people in Shanghai and Hangzhou alone were in its path that day.

On Monday, the deepest part of the shadow, or umbra, cast by the moon will fall over a 70-mile-wide (113-km-wide), 2,500-mile-long (4,000-km-long) ""path of totality"" traversing 14 states. The 12 million people who live there can view the eclipse at its fullest merely by walking outside and looking up, weather permitting.

Livestreaming and price-gouging

Some 200 million Americans reside within a day's drive of the totality zone, and as many as 7 million, experts say, are expected to converge on towns and campgrounds along the narrow corridor for the event. Many are attending multiday festivals featuring music, yoga and astronomy lectures.

Millions more could potentially watch in real time as the eclipse is captured by video cameras mounted on 50 high-altitude balloons and streamed online in a joint project between NASA and Montana State University. A partial eclipse will appear throughout North America.

Adding further to the excitement is the wide availability of affordable solar-safe sunglasses produced by the millions and selling so fast that suppliers were running out of stock.

The owner of one leading manufacturer reported price gouging by second-hand dealers who were buying up large supplies and reselling them over the internet at a huge mark-up.

Not all the hoopla will unfold on dry land. Welsh pop singer Bonnie Tyler is slated to perform her 1983s hit single ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" aboard a cruise liner as the vessel sails into the path of totality from Florida on Monday.

Back on the ground, forest rangers, police and city managers in the total eclipse zone are bracing for a crush of travelers they fear will cause epic traffic jams and heighten wildfire hazards.

""Imagine 20 Woodstock festivals occurring simultaneously across the nation,"" Michael Zeiler, an AAS advisory panel member wrote on his website, GreatAmericanEclipse.com, referring to the famously chaotic 1969 outdoor rock extravaganza in upstate New York.

Hundreds of residents in a prime-viewing area in Oregon had to evacuate on Saturday under threat from a wildfire raging in the Deschutes National Forest, according to InciWeb fire-tracking website.

The so-called Milli Fire, which has scorched more than 7,8OO acres (3,162 hectare), is one of seven burning in Oregon, Montana and Idaho, three of the states crossed by the totality path.

Zeiler, an avowed ""eclipse chaser"" who made the 650-mile (1,046-km) drive from his New Mexico home to Wyoming for a choice view, said South Carolina is likely to see the greatest influx as the destination state closest to the entire US Eastern seaboard.

Monday's event will be the first total solar eclipse spanning the entire continental United States since 1918 and the first visible anywhere in the Lower 48 states in 38 years.

The next one over North America is due in just seven years, in April 2024."

Wreckage of lost ship USS Indianapolis found after 7 decades,"Washington, August 20

Researchers announced on Sunday they discovered wreckage of the lost warship the USS Indianapolis, 72 years after the World War II cruiser was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.

The wreckage was found in the Philippine Sea 5.5 km below the surface, according to philanthropist Paul Allen, who headed the civilian research crew that located the ship.

The ship was hit in the final days of World War II just after completing a secret mission delivering parts of the atomic bomb used in Hiroshima.

The vessel sank in just 12 minutes, meaning it was unable to send a distress signal or deploy life-saving equipment, according to the history division of the US Navy.

Some 800 of the ship’s 1,196 sailors and marines initially survived the maritime disaster, but only 316 ultimately lived after enduring several days in shark-infested waters where they also faced risks of dehydration and drowning. Of those survivors, 22 are still alive today, the US Navy said.

“To be able to honour the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role in ending World War II is truly humbling,” said Allen.

“As Americans, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the crew for their courage, persistence and sacrifice in the face of horrendous circumstances.”

“While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming.”

Allen’s team is currently surveying the full site and plans to give a live tour of the wreckage in the coming weeks.

Since the sunken vessel is a war grave, it is protected by US law from being disturbed. — AFP"

Teachers of Adarsh School in Sangrur’s Balad Khurd village, students, AAP leaders and members of Vidhya Bachao Sangharsh Committee today blocked the NH-7 for two hours here in protest against the FCS Foundation, which has stopped releasing funds for the school. They threatened to lay siege to the office of the Director General, School Education (DGSE), on August 30 if the authorities failed to get the payment released from the foundation. The state government and the foundation signed an agreement to share the expenses of five Adarsh Schools, opened in 2012. The government pumps in 70 per cent of the money, while the foundation pitches in with the rest. The foundation stopped releasing funds in March. Purshotam Phaguwala, convener of the committee, said: “I have restarted my fast and will continue with it till the foundation releases the funds. The state government must get a fraud case registered against the foundation.” State AAP co-convener Aman Arora said, “Since the state government bears 70 per cent of the schools’ expenses, it must take action against the foundation. We will raise the matter in the Assembly, while our MP Bhagwant Mann will speak about it in Parliament.” Mrigesh Shastri, CEO of the foundation, could not be contacted in spite of repeated attempts."

The local Civil Hospital, which was upgraded and notified for 135 beds, lacks crucial infrastructure, including space for beds. The state government created 23 posts of paramedical and supporting staff for the hospital, but ignored doctors’ posts required for quality medical services.

Sources said Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh had announced the upgrade of the hospital from 100 to 135 beds in February last year, but its notification had remained hanging in balance for 14 months.

The hospital, which is catering to residents of Nurpur, Jawali, Fatehpur, Indora and Bhatiyat subdivisions, has 18 sanctioned posts of doctor, including specialist, but 13 doctors have been posted here. In the absence of on call duty system of specialists, emergency services are getting affected.

Moreover, the government has notified its upgrade, but no provision has been made to accommodate 35 sanctioned beds on the hospital premises. No infrastructure has been developed for the upgraded hospital.

RS Rana, Chief Medical Officer, Kangra, said no posts of doctor had been created by the government and the existing doctors would meet the requirement of 135-bed hospital. He also admitted that no extra space was available in the hospital premises to adjust additional 35 beds sanctioned by the state government. “For this purpose, the

proposal of constructing an additional hospital block along with its drawing and designing will be prepared and submitted to the government for its approval,” he said.

Signs of resistance in Punjab’s drug hubs

For 58-year-old, 'A' (name withheld on request), it all started when he was only nine years old. First it was bhang, then alcohol, and then, synthetic drugs. “My mother punched herself in her stomach, cursing god why she had to carry me in the womb.” Today, 'A' sits in a group of drug addicts, not as a victim, but as a counsellor. He is part of Narcotics Anonymous (NA), a group that works as addiction recovery group, founded in 1953 in the US. He is celebrating his “22nd birthday” — the day when he last had drugs. Things were so bad for him that one day his wife along with their daughter decided to end life, fed up as they were by his addiction and resultant daily clashes. “A neighbour had sold off his house over the same problem. The very idea of financial penury and the cumulated effect on children had frightened me,” he tells the group. “The law sees drug addiction as a crime, society terms it as evil and religious heads describe it as a sin. More than anything else, addiction is a disease that needs everyone's help for cure,” he says. Similar is the story of 'B'. He is in 17th year of his recovery period. He is now a struggling actor and wants to make some name in Punjab's thriving film industry. Dr Jaswinder Singh, an anaesthetist, has written two books of short stories highlighting rampant drug abuse. He says NA meetings across the globe have helped thousands of people to keep off drugs. He has treated many youths who connected with the group. There are several people in Punjab who have gone through the agony and are coming forward to fight drug dependence. Deepak, a local resident, does not conceal his identity. “I want victims of drug addiction to make up their mind to kick the habit. These people need motivation so that they return safely from the drug trap,” he said. A wholesale dealer in medicines, he fell victim to heroin addiction and lost all his earnings. Deepak counsels such patients at Swami Vivekanand De-addiction and Rehabilitation Centre at Government Medical College in Amritsar. He is a ‘peer educationist.’ Young Navtej Singh is yet another example of selfless service. He along with his mother runs an NGO Nashiyan Virudh Lok Jagriti Sanstha. Belonging to an Army family of Sudhar Raiputa village, he says he has the spirit to fight drug addiction. He, too, has been associated with Swami Vivkanand De-addiction Centre for several years, persuading the affected youth from rural areas to join the centre. “My family supports the cause. We keep aside a part of our earnings for our mission to create awareness.” He was honoured at the Independence Day celebrations for his contribution. Dr PD Garg, head Psychiatry department in Government Medical College, says NGOs and self-help groups play a vital role in the treatment of drug patients. “Regular counselling is a vital part of the treatment. Involvement of families, friends and teachers is necessary,” says Dr Garg. These NGOs work as link workers who identify drug users and bring them to the hospital for treatment."
India hitting on trial method,"Take on SL in ODI series opener, begin search for next ODI World Cup core

Dambulla, August 19

India will begin the journey to identify the core of their 2019 World Cup squad when they square off against Sri Lanka in a five-match ODI series starting here tomorrow. The visitors won the three-Test series with a 3-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka and will look to take that momentum into the limited-overs game. However, India are not treating this as just another bilateral ODI series. Chief selector MSK Prasad clearly outlined this, stressing on the aspect of fitness as Team India begins its preparations for the 2019 ODI World Cup in England. Rahul to bat at No. 4 The first step in that direction is the declaration that KL Rahul will bat at No. 4 in this five-match contest. The team management hopes this will prove to be a long-term move, ending the instability that has been associated with the No. 4 spot since the 2015 ODI World Cup when Ajinkya Rahane relinquished the position after an average showing.

Settled top

Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma will continue to open the innings with Rahane as the third-choice opener, given the presence of Manish Pandey and Kedar Jadhav in the squad. With MS Dhoni occupying the No. 5 spot and Hardik Pandya taking the all-rounder’s role at No. 7, both Pandey and Jadhav will be vying for that No. 6 spot. The Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium hasn’t been a happy hunting ground for the Men in Blue, though. They have played 17 ODIs here, stretching back to 2004, and won nine of those matches, including bilateral and triangular series (in 2005 and 2010 involving West Indies and New Zealand, respectively), and two Asia Cups in 2004 and 2010. Head-to-head against Sri Lanka, India have played 11 ODIs at this venue, winning only four of them.

Bowling attack

India’s full-time bowling combination looks settled, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah expected to lead the attack. Kuldeep Yadav has proven himself to be the captain’s frontline spin choice, and the second spinner’s toss-up will be between Axar Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal. Skipper Upul Tharanga will have his task cut out ahead of the challenge. But he will be buoyed by the fact that this side did manage to upset the Indian applecart in their last ODI match, played in the Champions Trophy in London in June. — PTIFor Sri Lanka, this series is more than just a matter of saving face after their heavy loss in the Test series. The hosts need two more ODI wins to confirm their spot in the 2019 ODI World Cup through automatic qualification. If they do manage this feat against India in the series, they will move to 90 points and then West Indies will not be able to overtake them in the rankings even if they win all the six ODIs against Ireland and England (taking their points from current 78 to 88) before the September 30 deadline. — PTIMatches India have won out of the last 18 ODIs they have played against Sri LankDhoni’s average with a strike-rate of 86 in ODIs in 2017"
Insure your assets against natural calamities,"KG Krishnamoorthy Rao

Climate change is not merely a much talked about subject anymore. It has started manifesting itself rather cruelly. Unseasonal heavy rains and floods are no longer abnormal. Every year, several parts of the country face unprecedented rain that causes mayhem in peoples’ lives. The constant lash of rain causes floods in several regions of India causing numerous deaths, health hazards, damage to automobiles and property.

Be prepared

While natural calamities are unpredictable and unavoidable, it is imperative that we keep ourselves prepared for such eventualities with effective loss-minimisation measures. However, there could still be financial losses due to damage to property which cannot be avoided altogether. Insurance provides effective solution in terms of mitigating such losses by providing adequate compensation.

Property, motor insurance

While life and health insurance covers are vital for every human being, it is essential to include property and motor insurance as an integral component of your financial planning. Few things in life matter as much to us, as our home does. Any damage to this can cause financial as well as emotional setback. While emotional setback is in the realm of the mind, only an appropriate insurance for property can safeguard one from financial setback. Apart from the building itself, the contents and other valuables in the house can also be protected through a home insurance cover. Usually, property insurance provides coverage against natural calamities such as fire, explosion and implosion, earthquake, lightning, storm, cyclone, tempest, tornado, hurricane, flood and inundation, subsidence, landslides and rockslides. Property/home insurance policies are not solutions for natural calamities alone. They offer compensation for losses arising out of a number of other eventualities. They provide coverage against fire, burglary/housebreaking and natural calamities, losses or damages to domestic and electronic appliances and portable equipment, such as laptops, liabilities like tenants’ legal liability, domestic workers compensation and public liability. During floods, automobiles are partially or completely submerged in water and citizens struggle with ways to recover their vehicle.

Innovative solutions

People in flood-prone areas find it difficult to get their cars towed away and delivered to workshops and dealers. Additionally, they are also charged higher parking fee by dealers (approx. Rs 11,000) and even higher by recovery van dealers just to get their cars towed away to a garage or workshop. These are times when insurers stretch themselves to offer timely and innovative solutions to mitigate the miseries of the customer. Insurers not only provide financial support for repairing your car but also can help you with valuable tips to avoid further aggravation of the loss or damage to the car.

Add-on covers

What is important is that you should not delay reporting your vehicle to the nearest workshop. The list of workshops can be availed from your insurer itself. It is advisable to purchase additional protection by way of add-on insurance covers, which can be added to your current policy at minimal cost. Add-on covers like engine protector/hydrostatic lock cover will cover you against losses to engine due to water ingression.

Right insurance cover

To buy the right insurance policies to cover your property and vehicle, especially during natural calamities, you need to evaluate various policies available in the market before signing on the dotted line. Gather all information on the policy and the insurer to understand their reputation in the market, particularly the speed of claim settlement. Be aware of the inclusions and exclusions of the policy so that you can have an appropriate mix of all that you require. Inexpensive covers may leave out some key coverage that is crucial for full protection. Look for available insurance riders. The insurance company that you approach may be able to offer you extra coverage especially for valuable items like jewellery. Time to take a call Timing, too, is important when it comes to disaster insurance. It is important that you may not be given a cover against a natural disaster when one is in the offing. Always remember to read the contents of the insurance policy. Do ensure that you purchase the policy from an insurer with a good claim settlement record. Think about the security and amity that the insurance protection will offer. The writer is Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Future Generali India Insurance Company Limited.

When the hill shook,"When the hill shook

Bhanu P Lohumi in Shimla

Landslides are becoming frequent as haphazard construction activities continue to weaken the hill stability. A series of tragedies involving hundreds of lives have not made government agencies to rethink development plans

Previous Next



It was well past midnight on August 12. It was cold, rainy. Bus passengers from Chamba to Manali and from Manali to Katra were busy sipping much-needed tea at Kotropi village (near Mandi), some 150 km from Manali. The buses were parked in opposite direction. Suddenly, a monstrous mass of mud and silt crashed down a hill and pounced upon the waiting buses. Huge rock pieces tore down the vehicles as the accumulated debris tossed the hangers-on into a jabbing judder. The bus drivers had turned on the ignition key in a hurry to escape. But it was too late. The earth had shaken. Screams followed as the landslide devoured 47 people. A shallow pond reportedly formed around the twisted, buried vehicles. Yet the tragedy is incomplete: though almost all know why a part of the hill collapsed, none has the will to find ways to stopping a recurrence. Some villagers told a team of geologists that they had noticed some boulders falling that day. “Many villagers living along the highway in that section had vacated their homes,” says Tek Singh, a former village head from neighbouring Urla. “The rocks above the road had cracked and seepage was visible.” Mandi deputy commissioner Sandeep Kadam said the rubble of the landslide blocked the adjacent stream. “This led to creation of an artificial pond. It has been cleared.” Three days later the National Remote Sensing Centre (ISRO, Hyderabad) came out with graphic details about what exactly happened at Kotropi at Pathankot-Nauni National Highway 154. In 'geological assessment' it said: “The area is in a thrust contact between the Shivaliks and the Shali group of rocks consisting mainly of dolomites, brick red shale, sandstones, purple clay and mudstones. The hardness of these rocks is in general less. These have been subjected to deformation by the thrust in the area, making them highly prone to landslides.” In simple terms, the thrust is aggravated by erosion of the upper soil crust because of activities such as road construction, making the hills unstable. An incessant rain further robs the slope of its strength. Result: landslides. The report also notes “deep incision of the tributaries” suggesting that some of the lineaments could be neotectonically active since there are near the main boundary thrust that separated the Shivalik. The hill vulnerability has increased many times in the recent past. The factors cited are: reckless development activities, deforestation, unscientific road construction, terracing, water intensive agricultural practices, and encroachment on steep hill slopes. The recent landslide is a grim wakeup call as the landslide recurred after 20 years. The report of geologist is awaited, but the locals blame post-construction haphazard debris disposal and a fragile mountain terrain. This is despite a clear warning from a Central government-sponsored study on Spatial Distribution and Concentration of Landslides released in 2003. The report said over 97% of the total geographical area of Himachal is landslide-prone. Here are a few instances: 1989: 40 people were killed in a landslide at Matiana on Hindustan-Tibet Highway in Shimla district. Buses had to be stopped as rocks continued to roll down before an entire hill had collapsed. 1995: Landslide killed over 60 people in the Luggar-Bhatti area of Kullu district. This landslide led to the accumulation of rubble 200-m long and 100-m high. The tragedy had struck in the morning rush hours when labourers, engaged by the PWD to clear the bank road leading to Manali, were at work. Almost all labourers, mostly Nepalese, and a few school children were killed. 1993: Landslide blocked the Sutlej near Jhakri on Hindustan-Tibet Highway. A huge lake was formed which took nearly six months to drain out even as the threat of flash flood loomed. The frequency of manmade landslides has increased. For instance, along the Shimla-Parvanoo Highway, where the road is being widened to four lanes the danger is from near-vertical passage, deforestation and lack of plantation. National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) general manager in Himachal Gursewak Singh Sangha says heavy rains are the biggest threat in areas where construction activity is going on. “We have asked geologists to suggest ways to prevent the hills from sliding”. Shimla, too, is also sinking at several places due to digging of slopes for construction and infrastructure development. The retention policy of the state government to regularize illegal construction on “as is where is” basis is a widely seen as a betrayal of environmental and modern living commitments. A survey of the sub-strata strength assumes immense significance because Shivalik hills are made up of rocks such as sandstone, shale and clay. “We have suggested measures taking into account the types of rocks,” says geologist Rajnish Sharma. “We always send a geological report of a forest land whenever PWD writes to us about any road construction.” Geologists have warned that slopes more than 45 degrees should not be cut. “High-retaining breast walls are usually recommended to reduce the landslide damage,” says special secretary revenue and disaster, DD Sharma. “For new constructions/widening of roads attempts should be made to keep old passages open. This can help in stabilizing the strata,” says RS Sood, prominent city planner and a retired IAS officer."

Colour calculus,"’ART & SOUL

In Devinder Goswamy’s designs, each shape and colour seems engaged in a dialogue with the next

B.N. Goswamy

“Let no one destitute of geometry enter my doors”. — Plato “Colour is the place where our brain and the Universe meet….Colour has got me; I no longer need to chase after it. It has got me for ever.” — Paul Klee “Vertical and horizontal lines are the expression of two opposing forces; they exist everywhere and dominate everything; their reciprocal action constitutes ‘life’. I recognize that the equilibrium of any particular aspect of nature rests on the equivalence of its opposites…”

— Piet Mondrian

For the greater part of his professional life, D.G. (that is the best way to refer to him, at least at this point) was involved with the performing arts. Working with Doordarshan in a high executive capacity, he remained engaged with the world of music and dance and theatre; he also wrote a number of stunning plays, mostly in Urdu, and kept directing them for the channel. He planned and worked; worked and planned, but always in those areas. After superannuation, or close to it, however, he somehow got drawn to the visual arts: to painting, in particular. What took him there is not easy to determine, but once he went there, so to speak, he stayed there. Much in the manner of the great Swiss painter, Paul Klee, who said once that ‘colour has got me… it has got me forever’, colours and shapes ‘got him’, became his new world, as it were. It would be fair to say that he began a bit gingerly. Attracted by the idea of collaging — ‘composing a work of art by pasting on a single surface various materials not normally associated with one another’, as the formal definition has it — he would fill a surface with snippets of images by great masters: van Gogh’s chair, for instance, Manet’s lunching party, Seurat’s stippled ballerina, Bhupen Khakhar’s brooding face, all tilted, torn out of context, jostling one another to the point of unease. But this did not last long. Very soon, he turned towards the purity of shapes and the tactile seduction of textures. He would assemble all kinds of papers and cardboards and plastic sheets, and sit surrounded by them gazing at each, making up his mind, cutting them up in different shapes and sizes. And then compose them in his mind. The process of putting them together naturally followed: cerebration, decision, trial and error, and the like. Traditional materials held for him great attraction: the sacred mauli thread for instance, pieces of hessian, coarsely woven uparna-like fabric, strips of embroidered ribbons. Everything became grist to his churning, artistic mill. It would not be easy to dis-entangle the skeins of his thought: Were there childhood memories here? An innate reverence for the sacred? Sights of struggling small-town shopkeepers and their goods? Interestingly, the bits and pieces that he picked for turning into images were not all placed — collaged — at the same level on the surface: some rose, others dipped, still others peeped over the walls of their neighbours, and so on. Even the edges of the total composition remained uneven at times. But somehow it all worked. Hard-edged shapes — squares and triangles and circles and rectangular strips — in various colours and configurations one would have naturally expected to figure in D.G.’s completely abstract work, and they did, each shape and colour setting up a dialogue with the one next to it. Not every colour was intense, not everything glowed with an inner fire, but a quiet, whispered conversation one could hear snatches of. But there also were works in which one could see a kind of frenzy: two circles made up of strips of coloured paper that seemed to be whirling at a dizzying speed, paper strip piled upon paper strip and in the centre, at the heart of the circle, gaping holes through which other things, other sights, could be seen, even as a dark, lurking gloom surrounded everything. This is the way it has gone on, this work, over a number of years. One of the more recent works, a tall ‘canvas’ — that, however, is not the right word, I know — appears to me to have been something of a tribute to the genius of Paul Klee who played with colours and shapes in the subtlest of manners. In this, the work titled ‘As Darkness Lifts’, the eye moves slowly, leisured-fashion, from dark edges towards the centre where a certain light begins to glow. There is no aura, no intensity, in the centre but a gentle spread of light — rectangles and squares of different shades, yellows and reds and light greens, overlapping and dove-tailing — suggesting the breaking of dawn, as it were. Inevitably, perhaps, a couplet of Ahmed Nadeem Qasimi’s comes to mind, at least to my mind: Sansanaate hain andherey to laraztey kyun ho? Har nayi subah ki takhleeq yun-hi hoti hai. [Why do you shudder when shadows gather and darkness seethes? Surely, this is how each morn arrives, triumphant.]

A night at the museum?,"Pierre Jeanneret Museum may soon open doors of its first floor for people to stay there

Amarjot Kaur

Brick by brick

A four-kanal house, numbered 57, in Chandigarh’s posh Sector 5 caught the UT administration’s attention somewhere in 2014, says Deepika Gandhi, director at Le Corbusier Centre and Chandigarh Architecture Museum. By then, the residential building designed and owned by Chandigarh’s first chief architect and town planning advisor Pierre Jeanneret, had served as home to several bureaucrats who had tampered with its original architecture. “It took us more than three years to bring the house back to its original form—that meant digging out old pictures and texts, even letters belonging to Pierre Jeanneret just to get the basic idea of how the house looked like. Also, the pictures we had were black and white, so getting the colours right was also a tricky part,” says Gandhi while highlighting the preliminary glitches of restoring the house that became the Pierre Jeanneret Museum this March. Its first floor comprising two rooms will soon be open for the public to stay there, informs Gandhi. “But we won’t just give it to anyone, considering how people had tampered with its architecture before, so this proposal is still underway,” she adds. “We want to make museums more interactive with public and financially viable too. Either CITCO or the department of tourism will take a call on this.” Dedicated to the memorabilia and achievements of Jeanneret, the house is the only residential building in the city that has been converted into a museum.“It took me six months just to collect data, drawings and old pictures. Some, I got from the Department of Urban Planning, while others I got from Foundation Le Corbusier in Paris,” says Gandhi. Elaborating on damage repair, she lists the horizontal bands along with windows had been broken, the windows were reversed (they were to open inwards) and the brick jaalis had been plugged in by bricks. “In fact, the entire fireplace was hidden behind a wall. We figured that out with the help of a photograph. While reconstructing it, there was a difference of three inches that a junior engineer suggested was because those days old bricks were used. He brought one and it fit like a glove,” she says. At present, the museum reflects Pierre’s personal expressions and vocabulary of architecture that romances latticed brickwork. With its foyer being the cynosure leading a spiral staircase to the first floor, and introducing visitors to Pierre’s reflections of beauty in line, shape, and form, also opens into his office and his drawing room on the ground floor. Along with blueprints of several buildings, are Pierre’s handwritten letters to Jawahar Lal Nehru, and others written to his cousin Le Corbusier, among those he wrote to MS Randhawa talking about his problems with the government machinery. At the fireplace, we found Prithviraj Kapoor’s note about Panjab University’s library written in Punjabi that reads: Akkhaan, dil, tey dimag vaasteyChannana ik tha tey vekhna hoveTah is liberary’ch aa jave bandaAjj itthey aake bada hi aanand mileya.

Know Pierre Jeanneret

He remained in Chandigarh from February 1951 to August 1965, and designed most of the government housing, schools, colleges, shopping centres, Gandhi Bhawan, Panjab University, and other infrastructure besides supervising the implementation of Le Corbusier’s designs of the Capitol Complex, Museum and Art Gallery, College of Art, City Centre, etc. Such was Jeanneret’s love for the city that as per his ‘will’ his ashes were immersed in the Sukhna Lake of Chandigarh after he died in 1967. During his stay in Chandigarh he lived in a self-designed house number 57 in Sector 5, from December 1954 to August 1965. Le Corbusier too used to stay in this house during his visits to Chandigarh every year."

New Delhi, August 19

Apparently playing the infamous online game “Blue Whale Challenge”, a Class XI boy today tried to commit suicide and jumped from fourth floor.

The police have raised doubts that the boy tried to commit suicide while playing the “Blue Whale Challenge” game.

According to police sources, the boy has been identified as Kush (16), a resident of Ashok Vihar.

After noticing Kush in the pool of blood, he was rushed to Ganga Ram Hospital, where his condition is said to be critical.

The police have recovered Kush’s bathroom sleepers, specs and mobile phone from the spot.

Presently, the police are investigating his phone details. According to a senior police officer, the boy might be in depression that’s why he took such a harsh step.

According to one of Kush’s family members, earlier Kush was studying in some other school and he used to miss his old friends which could be the reason of his depression. The police are waiting for Kush to regain his consciousness so that they could record his statement.

The DCP (Northwest) said the police are investigating the incident of suicide attempt of 16-year-old student in Ashok Vihar. Inquiry conducted, so far, says that the role of “Blue Whale Challenge” game has not been established till now.”

The macabre game, which is said to have originated in Russia, is suspected to have claimed a teenager’s life in Mumbai recently. The Class IX student, apparently a participant in “Blue Whale Challenge”, jumped to his death from the fifth floor of a building in suburban Andheri in Mumbai on July 29.

The game starts by asking participants via social media to draw a whale on a piece of paper, then carve a whale figure on their body, and then gives other tasks such as watching horror movies alone or waking up at unearthly hours. The tasks also involve self-harm, while the final challenge is to commit suicide."
Ready to lose a few games while trying new things: Kohli,"Dambulla, August 19

India captain Virat Kohli wants specific roles for certain players keeping a two-year time frame leading up to the 2019 World Cup in mind. “For us, it is about the time frame. It is not about which opposition we are playing. You can’t pick and choose. I have never believed in that and we as a team don’t believe in that,” Kohli said when asked about whether he will use players depending on the opposition. “Two years to go for the World Cup, now is the time to give players certain roles to get into the groove and understand what we need to do,” said Kohli. The skipper confirmed that KL Rahul is a certainty in the middle-order while Kedar Jadhav and Manish Pandey will be fighting for the remaining middle-order slot. “Manish Pandey has done well and grabbed his opportunities. He has got a hundred in Australia as well and we know about his talent. He is super fit and has a bright future ahead of him. So he will certainly be backed. All the three guys (including Kedar Jadhav) will have to compete for two spots in the middle-order. There are no guarantees I would say. As long as there is healthy competition, everyone will keep pushing each other and that is healthy for Indian cricket,” the skipper opined. With a whole lot of ODIs lined up in coming months, Kohli stressed on experimentation and not getting bogged down by the expectation of an India victory every time they step on to the field. “For us, it’s all about when you want to start giving roles to the players and start experimenting as a team. Sometimes we get so carried away by expectations that we don’t follow a pattern. So it’s very important to understand that as a group,” the skipper said. For him, accepting challenges and critical comments along the way is a part of that process. “We should be ready to lose a few games when you need to try out something. We are very comfortable with trying things in very different ways. But we need to start making the effort because 8-10 months down the line, we will be solid in our roles and what we need to do as a team,” he added. — PTI"
Censure board?,"Censure board?

Nonika Singh in Chandigarh

Under Pahlaj Nihalani CBFC earned the notoriety of being tyrannical and scissor-happy. Newly-appointed board chairperson Prasoon Joshi, the film industry feels, has on his hands the task of significant course correction

Previous Next



Beep, beep, cut, cut… as long as the lord of controversies Pahlaj Nihalani remained at the helm of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), he and the films he censured/censored made headlines. Nihalani's exit and lyricist poet and ad guru Prasoon Joshi’s appointment as the new CBFC chairperson is indeed not just a routine change of guard. There is much to read here, may be a lot to cheer, if Nihalani’s words “god bless those who are celebrating my departure” are to be taken seriously for once. If there was little doubt about Nihalani’s absurd ways of working, there can be no questions about Joshi’s finesse as a poet and sensitivity as a writer. But can one man’s elevation and another’s sacking be the answer to all issues that ail filmmakers? Director Hansal Mehta, whose film Aligarh ran into trouble with the CBFC, doesn’t think it’s fair to put the blame of all that’s wrong with the outdated cinematograph Act on just one person. Certainly tempers ran high when Mehta’s Aligarh, a film on homosexuality, was given an adult certificate, stalling possibilities of the film’s promotion. Time and again producers or directors found themselves at the receiving end. The list of movies that had to bear the brunt of CBFC, running in hyperactive mode under Nihalani, is endless: Udta Punjab, Spectre, Lipstick Under My Burkha, Babumoshai Bandookbaz…. Rare was a film that did not have a run in with the man obsessed with sanskar, Indian ethos and values. Lip locks, abuses, use of words like intercourse… anything and everything even a reference to a city or state could raise his hackles. But with Nihalani out of sight, Mehta can perhaps rationalise that may be Nihalani was just implementing rules, or following the information and broadcasting ministry orders. If the latter is true, uneasy lies the time ahead. Ashoke Pandit, former member of CBFC (during Nihalani’s tenure) however, is more scathing in his assessment. He believes, “Rules were merely a fig leaf with which Nihalani tried to cover his misdeeds. Which rules say there had to be a banned list of cuss words? Or that words like Kanpur and Kishore Kumar can't be referred to. Nihalani wanted directors to make films as per his individual sense and sensibility. Which filmmaker would agree to that?” Besides, he reminds that the same films he censored were ultimately either cleared by FCAT or the courts. Pandit believes Joshi is the right man for the job. “In sync with today's times, Joshi understands the world cinema and has worked with the very best makers in the country.” Mehta, however, feels that the CBFC should not be personality driven, instead be guided by crystal clear guidelines. That’s precisely why he would not jump the gun and hail the newly constituted CBFC as the panacea. Actor Aahana Kumra stands pleased and fearless like the bold character she played in Lipstick Under My Burkha, the film that was even denied certification and is rumoured to be the real trigger for Nihalani's ouster. She says, “I am hopeful that with Joshi as the chairperson and actors like Vidya Balan on the board, path-breaking films, especially women centric subjects, will be viewed favourably.” Producer director Prakash Jha who has been at loggerheads with the CBFC has only one word answer — no censorship. Is absence of censorship a guarantee of good cinema? May be not… after all there is censorship in Iran and the country's makers have been producing world-class cinema. In a democracy that India is, artists feel strongly against censorship which they insist connotes backwardness, just as George Bernard Shaw would say, “The first condition of progress is the removal of censorship.” Whether Joshi can ensure that scissors are laid to rest remains to be seen. Right now Joshi, too, doesn't have the answers, only claims to have the right intent. And that's what really matters feels Pandit. “If Nihalani had the inclination to change, instead of bothering about nitty-gritties, he would have worked towards implementing Benegal committee recommendations which have been around for a year now.” Mehta is not sure whether the Benegal committee guidelines are a fit-all solution or that there can be a please-all policy. But Pandit reasons, “If implemented, Benegal guidelines would be a good start for sure.” Propelled by Joshi’s vision who clearly doesn’t endorse micromanagement, he foresees happy times for the Indian cinema. Round one of sniping and snipping may have lasted too long but for now votaries of cinema seem to heave a sigh of relief and reassurance."

Have instructed Chairman Rly Board,Member Traffic to oversee rescue and relief operations.I am personally monitoring situation — Suresh Prabhu (@sureshpprabhu) August 19, 2017



Twenty-three persons were killed and over 60 injured when at least eight coaches of the Haridwar-bound 18477 Utkal Express derailed at the Khatauli railway station, 25 km from Muzaffarnagar, in western Uttar Pradesh this evening. The train, headed from Puri in Odisha to Haridwar in Uttarakhand, was to reach its destination at 9 pm. Rescuers and local people struggled for hours to pull out survivors from the overturned and mangled coaches, some piled on top of each other.Two NDRF teams of 50 persons each and sniffer dogs reached the crash site for rescue operations. At least 65 ambulances from Meerut and Saharanpur were pressed into service. The injured were taken to the Medical College Hospital, Meerut, and the Muzaffarnagar District Hospital. Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has ordered an inquiry to ascertain the cause of the mishap, even as an Anti-Terror Squad team has rushed to the site.While Prabhu announced Rs 3.5 lakh for the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for each of the seriously injured, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who sent Cabinet Ministers Satish Mahana and Suresh Rana to the site, announced Rs 2 lakh each for the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured. Prabhu later tweeted: “Rescue operations have been completed. All injured shifted to hospital. Restoration work will start now. Still monitoring situation closely.”Sources said the S2 sleeper coach jumped the tracks and smashed into a house along the railway line. The house owner, whose father had a narrow escape, told a TV channel the track was being repaired since morning without the railway staff putting up the mandatory notice.He said the train approached at full speed and its driver had clearly not been informed about the damaged track. The worst hit was the pantry car which was reduced to mangled bits of steel. The accident site is a stone’s throw from the Khatauli Kotwali police station. A large number of locals were the first to start rescue work after the accident occurred around 5.45 pm. Despite the police arriving there, it were the locals who arranged for the first gas-cutter from a sugar mill in the vicinity. “Extremely pained by the derailment of the Utkal Express in Muzaffarnagar. My thoughts are with the families of the deceased,” PM Narendra Modi tweeted.

There are two types of people in the world — the doers and the rest. Times when Mother Earth is witnessing abnormal climatic conditions and concrete jungles are fast replacing the green cover; some doers are working relentlessly to make things better for themselves, the rest and the rest of the rest. They are the ones who cared to stop by, smelled the roses, ploughed their own fields, then someone else's till their acts became contagious and sparked a movement. Here's to the everyday eco-heroes who refused to be non-participants, who started as one-man armies, faced the heat and still ushered in positive changes. Now in the latter part of their lives, these persons promise to leave the world a greener and finer place.

Jungle all the way

Jagat Singh Chaudhary, a BSF soldier, had just been home on leave in the fall of 1973 when a village woman, out to get fodder, fell down a mountain and sustained fatal injuries. The incident might have been unfortunate in every way, but it wasn't anything new for Kot Malla and many other villages of Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, where trekking to treacherous heights for essentials like water and fodder was part of every woman's daily routine.

The incident kept the young soldier up all night. The rest of his holidays were spent finding ways to improve the plight of the womenfolk of his village. Little did he know that what he would eventually start as an unfeigned attempt to provide respite to his fellow villagers would one day earn him a special name.

Chaudhary decided to grow plants on a wasteland his father owned, which was not just barren, but also uneven and stony. In 1980, he decided to hang up his boots and started cultivating these two barren hectares. Since no water was available in the vicinity, Jagat would walk 3 km daily, carrying water pots on his shoulders. His unbridled enthusiasm was infectious. Many others were inspired to go the ‘Jungli ‘way. Jungli was the name villagers gave the retired soldier.

After turning an unyielding land into a jungle of mixed plants, Jungli started planting cash crops such as ginger, turmeric, pulses, vegetables and herbs, which not only benefited the environment, but also provided livelihood to people.

Suman Saurabh, a Delhi university student, made Jungli’s work the focus of his post-graduation thesis. “There are very few people who're doing the real work. I came to know about Jagat sir from my professor. A visit to his jungle in Rudraprayag was so inspirational that I decided to study it further,” maintains Suman.

In 2007, Chaudhary was invited by HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, to develop a model forest on the campus, which he did till 2010.

He’s been undertaking plantation activities using wood, stone and pit technology. Now 70, ‘Jungli’ says he wants to save the future generations from the ill-effects of environment change; that’s why all the efforts.

Chamba's Chipko campaigner

Sunderlal Bahuguna’s Chipko Movement of 1981 offered meaning and purpose to many people across the country. Though working for the cause of environment since 1973, the movement marked an important event in the life of Kulbhushan Upmanyu of Kamla village in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, who marched from Kashmir to Kohima as part of the movement.

After school, Upmanyu decided to cultivate a piece of land in his village. A small field could not contain this young man’s dream, who refused to turn a blind eye to the problems his fellow villagers faced. Soon, he formed a development group with other villagers in 1973, where they addressed issues of villagers without any government help. He started working towards making the village self-sustainable.

What Bahuguna’s movement gave Upmanyu was a reason to concentrate on forests. He soon became a frontline campaigner in spreading awareness on forest conservation. That time, pine and eucalyptus plantation was under way on a large scale in Himachal, a dangerous practice which was set to jeopardise the ecosystem of the region and put villages in a major fodder crisis. Upmanyu stood up against the destructive move and launched a campaign. His consistent efforts bore fruit and after a seven-year fight, eucalyptus plantation was banned on the government land across the state and pine plantation was majorly discouraged. Owing to his endeavours to protect forests in the years to follow, oaks and rhododendron were declared protected in Himachal.

“It's important to focus on two things — plantation and systematic waste disposal. In plantation, we have to bring in more multi-purpose species and avoid pine and eucalyptus. There's also a need to learn the scientific ways of garbage disposal. The authorities should adopt the European model of waste disposal, which almost eliminates the chances of pollution,” says Upmanyu.

“I have always been interested in forestry. About five-six years ago, I met Upmanyu ji and joined him. He's been working for the preservation of forests for decades and his contribution is inspirational,” says Ranjeet of Chamba.

For many years, Upmanyu has been running an NGO — Himalaya Bachao Samiti. He now usually takes up advocacy work, but that, by no means, stops him from daily escapades into the wild.

The eco-warrior from Marathaland

When Ravi Purandre landed in India after spending the prime years of his life in the Gulf, he threw away his passport to purposely banish the temptation to travel any further.

Besides the warmth and love of his family, returning home to Pune also meant starting anew and finding a job. While still looking for one, he would unpremeditatedly wander off to Hanuman Tekdi — a bleak and lifeless hill, which had long been a haven for gamblers and drunkards.

The year was 1999, the hill was barren and Purandre had an idea whose time had come. He wanted to make Hanuman Tekdi green. He started planting saplings on the hill. Soon he met Srikant Paranjpe, who had already been working in this direction. “Together we started planting saplings and making trenches to harvest rainwater,” says Purandre, as he recalls the onset of the journey.

“One day, I saw NCC cadets practising for the RD parade at the Symbiosis College ground. When you have an unwavering commitment to your work, it's almost impossible not to connect it with everything you see. So yes, I saw these spirited children sweating it out and realised there was little that could match their verve and vibrancy. I wanted to rope in children and bring them to the hill for helping us. But above all, I believed that we, adults, had a responsibility that ran deeper than our subjective goals. It is not only wise, but also indispensable to inculcate regard and respect for nature in our young ones,” he asserts.

Pune schools and colleges, too, realised there was a wide scope for EVS activities at the once insipid Hanuman Tekdi. “We'd have youngsters working, laughing and eating together all day. It never felt like work,” says Purandre.

All along, the facelift of the hill was a matter inspiring enough to pique the curiosity of Pune residents, who now started dotting the hill for their walk.

In 2004, his group started getting support from the Pune Municipal Corporation.

“Moving ahead, we started making coco peat using a shredder, which I, being a mechanical engineer, designed myself. Once crushed, coco peat is used for mulching. It retains moisture like nothing else. A complete waste for the city, coconut shells were a treasure for our plants,” explains an innovative Purandre.

Pune had been facing a problem of leaf litter for a long time. Purandre came to the rescue, yet again. “Two years ago, we created six tonnes of best-quality compost using leaf litter, putting an end to the problem. Our target is to make 30 tonne compost by the end of this year and I am confident that we'll find the first-of- its-kind leaf shredding solution in India,” he asserts.

Eighteen years have passed since Purandre and his team started rainwater harvesting and plantation on the rocky Hanuman Tekdi. Today, the hill is unrecognisable with green cover over 60 acres. Three heart attacks and a bypass surgery has failed to shake Purandre's resolve. Every morning, he walks up the hill, his steps hard to match, while children from nearby schools flock the area to assist him. “Is it work?” It’s not, they know."
Secure garden,"GROUND REALTY

Jagvir Goyal

A spurt in cancer cases in North India and awareness about the ill effects of excessive use of pesticides has made people look for organic food or make effort to grow their own vegetables. While a company has launched vegetable and fruit purifier which has not been much successful, trend of growing own vegetables is fast catching up in urban areas. ‘Plant to Plate’ is becoming a tagline for the urban elite. As a result everyone wants to have his own kitchen garden, grow vegetables and enjoy healthy and pesticide-free food. As far as one is living on the ground floor, there is no problem in developing a kitchen garden. One can always find a corner or some space in the front or back courtyard to develop the kitchen garden. And there are no structural issues involved. The challenge lies in developing a kitchen garden while living on the first floor or higher elevations, in flats or apartments. Here, the front or back balconies are considered to be most suitable locations for developing kitchen garden because plenty of sunlight and air are available. What is more important to watch are the structural features of the kitchen garden. Let’s have a look at the related engineering aspects of this new trend:

Structural features

Developing a kitchen garden in a balcony or on the terrace means deposition of extra earth load over the balcony or terrace slab. This extra load on the slab causes stresses in it and at the slab supports. Application of water to the plants may cause retention of water on the balcony or terrace leading to dampness in the area. Then establishment of proper drainage system has also to be taken care of. Thus, there are three major structural features: Structural design, water proofing and drainage arrangements. design: The design of the floor slab over which a kitchen garden is to be developed, needs to be rechecked by taking into account the extra load of earth and other items that shall be rested over the slab. Often the weight of earth is counted but the weight of extra pots that are laid there is ignored. Weight of pots is significant and needs to be considered as ‘pointed load’. It is better to use stands for the pots instead of placing them directly on the slab to disperse their load over a wider area.To cause lesser load on the slab, wooden, plastic, aluminium or fibre pots should be selected. The weight of soil should be considered as saturated slab so that weight of water also gets counted. Normally, the thickness of soil mixed with manure layer thickness is 8 inch to 10 inch. By rechecking the design, it should be ensured that the slab and its supports can wear the extra load being put on it without causing any cracks in them. Cantilevers: If a kitchen garden is being developed in a balcony, be extra cautious. Most of the balconies are designed as cantilevers and cantilevers are infamous for their failure in the history of civil engineering. A cantilever is simply projecting from a wall without any other support below it. If the cantilever slab is found to be unsafe for extra load being caused on it, supports below it should be provided before developing kitchen garden in the balcony. It should also be seen that making all this arrangement of extra supports below the cantilever slab is not uneconomical. Waterproofing: Needless to say that waterproofing of kitchen garden slab is as important as its structural design. To provide waterproofing, proper treatment should be given to the slab before laying the garden. The slab surface should be cleaned well with wire brushes and then treated well by applying polymer-based flexible water proofing layers on it. While doing this, if any cracks are noted in the slab, these should be treated well by converting them into small V-shaped crevices and then filling them with a polymer modified mortar. For waterproofing, it is better to lay a layer of 6mm thick 1 : 3 cement sand mortar over the slab after adding waterproofing compound to the mortar. Over the mortar layer, a layer of tiles can be laid in slope as per drainage plan. Drainage arrangement: In case of balconies and terraces, it is common practice to provide proper slope to the slab area during their construction, for drainage of rain water through rain water pipes. A concrete ‘gola’ at the junction of the slab and parapets is also provided in normal practice as these junctions are the vulnerable leakage points. While developing a kitchen garden in balcony or on terrace, a 2 inch thick layer of water-borne aggregate or shingle or pebbles should also be laid over the tiles in the same slope by maintaining the two-inch thickness uniformly so that the slope of tiles is acquired by the stone layer also. This whole system shall provide effective drainage arrangement. All these loads should be considered while rechecking the structural design of the slab. Geo-membrane provision: For creating best kitchen garden arrangement, it is better to lay a thick layer of geo membrane on the tiles before covering them with the pebbles or stones. However, this is optional as the geo-membrane layer will causeadditional cost. Otherwise, a HDPE net layer can be laid over the stones. This geo membrane or HDPE net layer will prove helpful in holding back the soil while excess rain water in balcony gets drained off to the rain water pipes. Next, the soil layer can be laid as the base for it is now ready to receive the soil. The water connection: Provision of a water connection in the balcony or terrace is essential for a productive kitchen garden growing vegetables. Generally, we keep a tap on the terrace or balcony to draw water. Same tap can be used for watering the vegetable plants in kitchen garden. Outsourcing the job: As growing on vegetables is becoming a craze among people, many companies who undertake development of kitchen garden now exist in every city. An online search will tell you about their existence. And howsoever small space be available with you, they would develop your kitchen garden in it. Even a 4 x 4 feet space is converted by them. Contact them and assign them the job. However, just ensure that all structural aspects are taken care of and joy of having a kitchen garden is not marred by structural cracks or dampness or leakage or failure of balconies. — The writer is former HoD and engineer-in-chief, civil engineering department in

High BP during pregnancy ups risk of heart disease later,"Washington

Women who experience hypertension during pregnancy face an increased risk of heart disease and hypertension later in life, a new study reveals.

Researchers from McGill University in Montreal, Canada analysed 1,46,748 women with a first pregnancy.

The results suggested that after a follow-up of approximately four-and-a-half years, 997 women were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and 6,812 women developed hypertension.

When they were compared with women without hypertension during pregnancy, those with hypertension during pregnancy had a 2.2-times higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease and a 5.6-times higher risk of developing hypertension after pregnancy.

Subsequent pregnancies did not appear to influence these associations.

Lead author Sonia Grandi said that the study highlights the need for long-term follow-up of women with a history of hypertension during pregnancy to provide early management of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. — ANI"
Failed mechanics,"MOVIE REVIEW: ANNABELLE: CREATION

Set in the 1940’s, “Annabelle: Creation” the prequel to “Annabelle,” which was in turn a spinoff of “The Conjuring,” is the third cinematic outing for the demon-host, a wooden doll made by the doll-maker Sam Mullins( Anthony La Paglia), who lost his daughter in an accident(the only strikingly shocking scene in the entire movie).

His wife Esther (Miranda Otto) has already become a victim of the demonic doll and is now living a secluded mysterious life within the confines of her own bedroom.

The Doll has been cloistered within a closet papered with Bible readings, in their sprawling California farm house for a few years now. And into this set-up they introduce a bunch of six orphans - Prepubescent Polio-stricken and wearing a leg-brace, young Janice (Talitha Bateman), her best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson), a motley group of pre-teens and their caretaker Nun, Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman).

Could be they thought that inviting strictly catholic folk would absolve them of their descent into evil? But what about the young ones who have basically been set-up for scare-happy voyeuristic entertainment? That the religious Church going Mullins’ put young helpless children in harm’s way is a little hard to stomach.

Returning ‘Annabelle’ screenwriter Gary Dauberman contrives to have Janice curious enough to overcome her fears and investigate the mysteries of the old house, thus laying out the plot points that would eventually lead to her victimisation. Linda is also drawn in while the Nun and her other four wards have their own scary encounters to deal with. And there’s really nothing new to keep you absorbed here.

The fright tactics employed here are not effective enough even though they have old school generic effects written all over them. No doubt Sandberg’s narration follows the genre ritual of terrorising its female characters, but this time they are a little too young to be validated by such impunity!"

“Gross NPA ratio of the banking system at 9.6 per cent and stressed advances ratio at 12 per cent as of March 2017 on the back of persistently high ratio in the past few years, is indeed a matter of concern,” Patel told a gathering of bankers and industrialists in the presence of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley here.

Admitting that the balance sheet of most state-run banks are not healthy enough to take large haircuts, which is a corollary of any bad loan resolution, he called for their recapitalisation.

“NPA resolution would necessitate a higher re- capitalisation of these banks,” he said, adding “Government and the RBI are in dialogue to prepare a set of measures to enable state-run banks to shore up the requisite capital in a time bound manner.”

Regulatory or rather the economic challenge in dealing with the NPA issue gets accentuated when seen against the capital position of some of the banks, particularly public sector banks, he told an insolvency summit, hosted by industry lobby CII and chaired Jaitley.

The RBI chief said as much as 86.5 per cent of GNPAs are accounted by large borrowers.

“Swift time bound resolution or liquidation of stressed assets will be critical for delogging the balance sheet and for efficient reallocation of bank capital,” Patel said.

The government and the RBI are working together to comprehensively address the issue through a multi-pronged approach, he added.

Stating that the success and credibility of all the NPA resolution efforts will be critically contingent on the strength of public sector banks’ balance sheets to absorb the costs, he said any resolution will involve deep haircuts.

“It is clear that state-run banks will need to take haircuts on current exposures under any resolution plan agreed within or outside the IBC. Higher provisioning requirements on this counts as well as other factors will affect the capital position of several banks,” he said.

The measures could include a combination of capital raising from the market, dilution of government holding, additional capital infusion by the government, merger based on strategic decision and sale of non-core assets.

The RBI chief also blamed lenders for the mess, saying their poor credit appraisal systems have led to the pile of bad loans, which tops over Rs 9 trillion now. PTI"
Narang takes big leap in honing budding shooters,"Sabi Hussain

Tribune News Service

New Delhi, August 19

2012 London Olympics bronze medallist Gagan Narang is already credited with nurturing talented shooters like Heena Sidhu, Apurvi Chandela and Rahi Sarnobat, who all trained at his 'Gun for Glory' shooting academies for years. For rising stars like Pooja Ghatkar, Mahima and Turhi Agarwal, the 10m air rifle shooter is perfectly playing the role of a mentor. Always ready to give back to the sport, which gave him all the name and fame, the 34-year-old Narang is ready with another ambitious programme — Project Leap — to produce future Olympics champions. He spoke to The Tribune about the project:

Excerpts:

Project Leap is about identifying young and talented shooters and train them into medal-winning prospects at the international championships, including Olympics. For the first year, we have begun by selecting 23 out of the 57 shortlisted shooters. The shooters went through a trial, where they were asked to showcase their scientific, physical, meta-cognitive and technical skills. Out of the chosen ones, Mahima and Elanevil are already part of the junior national team. The selected shooters will attend a fully-funded Elite Junior Excellence Camp at the Balewadi Sports Complex in Pune and will be trained by world-renowned coaches Anton Belak (Slovakia) and Kim Seonil (Korea).The methodology is to organise five camps of 12 days each over a period of one year. It's about getting 60 days of elite coaching from foreign experts. We have divided the age groups in five categories — 10-12, 12-14, 14-16, 16-18 and 18-20. There will be a dedicated team of professionals to monitor a shooter's scores, basics and technical skills. When theses shooters get selected for the Indian team, they don't have to start from the scratch. The coaches at the junior national camps would only be required to finetune their skills. If we are targeting a medal at the 2020 or 2024 Olympics, we have to start from the grassroots level.These shooters would return to the Gun for Glory regional academies. Their progress would be monitored by the academy coaches, who have already been trained by foreign coaches. It's about ensuring that the training imparted to these shooters remains in sync with the programme. The shooters would then be encouraged to participate in domestic competitions to break into the national team.I have just made a comeback into the national team in the 10m air rifle event. At the moment, I am focussing on air rifle and 50m rifle prone events. Prone would, of course, go out of the 2020 Olympic programme. But, it would remain there until the World Championships next year. So, for the CWG, Asian Games and World Championships, I would compete in the air rifle and 50m prone. After the Worlds, I will start focussing on 50m rifle 3-positions."
"Anderson, Roland-Jones make WI follow on","BIRMINGHAM, August 19

England were inspired by James Anderson and Toby Roland-Jones as they forced West Indies to follow on before closing in on the easiest of victories in the landmark Day-Night Test match at Edgbaston on Saturday. Anderson led the charge with three wickets and a run-out as the hosts bowled out the visitors for just 168 early in the second session of a damp third day, still 346 runs adrift of England's mammoth total of 514/8 declared. Then with the floodlights on and the pink ball moving around in cold, breezy conditions, Joe Root invited the Windies to bat again only for Anderson and Roland-Jones, who had also taken two first-innings wickets, to soon strike again. The visitors took tea at 76/4 in their second innings, still 270 behind and staring at the prospect of going one down in the three-Test series. England's all-time leading wicket taker Anderson and Roland-Jones, continuing the excellent start to his Test career, ensured England continued their domination of the match in a seven-wicket opening session. Only Jermaine Blackwood showed any resistance for the West Indies with a laudable, counter-attacking 79 not out. Anderson continued where he left off after a false start when the players had to come off after just one ball because of rain. On the resumption, he produced a sharp, rearing delivery off a length that had Kyle Hope helplessly steering the ball to Ben Stokes at gully. Anderson then ran out Kieran Powell, who had embarked on a calamitous quick single, with a direct hit before he got rid of Roston Chase, inducing him to play on. Only Jamaican Blackwood, who struck two sixes and nine fours, stood firm with his 49-ball half-century, going on to his 79 off just 76 balls. Anderson finished with 3/34 off his 15 overs with Roland-Jones and Broad both taking two wickets apiece. The visitors were given no respite second time around, Anderson having Powell caught at slip, before Roland-Jones trapped Kyle Hope leg before and Ben Stokes had his brother Shai snaffled by slip Root. In the last over before tea, the Windies misery was made almost complete when the mainstay of their second innings, Kraigg Brathwaite, was given out for 40, lbw to Moeen on review, the 13th wicket to fall on the day. Brief Scores: England: 514/8 decl; West Indies: 168 (Blackwood 79*; Anderson 3/34) and 76/4 (Brathwaite 40). — Reuters"
"Global challenges, local solutions","American students travelling through India realise answers to climate change could well be within us

Neha Kirpal

Water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink.” These oft-repeated lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner hold true in these times more than they ever did. Water is scarce, and not just in the third world. Its repercussions are being experienced across the globe. This is what a group of 25 young high school students — 20 from the US and five from rural and tribal communities in India — found out while travelling through Delhi, Agra and Ladakh in a unique ‘learning through travel’ programme recently. The programme, spread out over three weeks in July, aimed to make potential future leaders socially, culturally and responsibly global citizens. Leadership collective 360Plus, theatre group Junoon and travel services provider Voygr brought together the teenagers from more than 15 diverse geographies and demographics. The theme for the year was climate change, its affects and global challenges. This was the first year that Indian students participated along with students from the US. The group first embarked upon heritage walks around old Delhi. During the old Delhi tour, they were taken to the fascinating Ugrasen ki Baoli. A step well that is used to hold water for villagers, the baoli has been around for about six centuries. Fascinated by the structure, Daviontea Bass, a student from Chicago, did a little research for herself and shared it with us. “Baolis were made around the country in hotter places because people needed a cool place to chill, swim, sleep and eat,” she observed and was surprised that they were still functioning. There were the usual tourist spots too, but not without that twist of education. Take the trip to Taj Mahal, for instance. Farhan Mashud, a student from New York, was fascinated to discover the importance of water in building and maintaining the structure of the historic monument. “It was interesting to know that the monument was built on wells that contained water and were filled with wood. This is said to have increased the life of the wooden foundation,” he said. Two artist facilitators travelled throughout with the students and took them through art processes and workshops that stimulate enquiry, reflection, exploration, perspective and expression. Sanjna Kapoor, co-founder Junoon, said, “To get a chance to work with this group of youngsters and artists together to explore the implications of climate change in our lives is a beautiful way of creating learning opportunities.” While they had heard about how climate change is directly affecting Ladakh in a session on climate change with environmental activist Dr Vandana Shiva, it was only after a visit there that they realised what it meant. Ladakh, with decreasing snowfall, melting glaciers and prolonged summers, is one of the frontiers of the climate change debate. After acclimatising to the altitude, the group got to spend some time at the eco-friendly Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) campus. Located on the banks of Indus river, the mountainous Hemis National Park in the background and a clear night sky, it made for the perfect place to live in the midst of nature. Here, students from the Leadership Collective gave talks, presentations and English conversation classes to local students. The group noticed that the river was swollen by seasonal snowmelt and its chocolate colour was indicative of pollution. However, when the students tested a water sample from the river, it was negative for nitrites, nitrates and had healthy levels of iron and hardness. It was refreshing to see that even though access to water is rapidly changing in the region, the river continues to remain relatively pristine. Through the three-and-half week journey, the group experienced bonding, learning and contemplating together on themes that impact the world. From changing spring sources in rural California, seminars about green economics in San Francisco, the drying of the Agressan ki Baoli in Delhi and the staining of the Taj Mahal in Agra, the students were able to see the connections… and maybe find some answers too."
"Gharaunda tense, Sec 144 imposed","500 booked for attacking police station

Parveen Arora

Tribune News Service

Karnal, August 19

Scattered stones, broken glass windows and damaged vehicles at Gharaunda police station say it all. The police station was attacked late last evening following the arrest of Zila Parishad member Deepak Tyagi booked for an altercation with UHBVN employees in Pundri and Barsat villages some days ago. With the situation continuing to be tense, Deputy Commissioner Aditya Dahiya imposed Section 144 in Gharaunda, even as several social organisations met SDM Varsha Khangwal and demanded stringent action against those indulging in violence. The police booked 500 unidentified persons for damaging the police station, trying to set it ablaze, attempting to kill police personnel on duty and blocking the national highway. “We have registered a case against 500 persons who tried to set ablaze the police station and ransacked the premises,” said Jashandeep Singh Randhawa, SP. In Assandh, traders kept their shutters down to protest “forcible” closure of their shops on Friday. Meanwhile, the Assandh police have registered an FIR against local MLA Bakhshish Singh Virk and others for the alleged attack on mediapersons covering the unrest. It claimed no evidence had been found against the MLA so far. Virk stoutly refuted the charges, claiming he was not even at the site of the incident. Talking with The Tribune on the phone, he claimed: “I have no role at all.” Sources say some youths from a community forced the shopkeepers to down their shutters following an altercation with youths of another community on August 14. Some of them attacked the offices of mediapersons too. The SP said two FIRs have been registered—one for the attack on mediapersons and the other on forcing a bandh in the town."

Muzaffarnagar District Magistrate G S Priydarshi, who has been at the accident site, said the total number of coaches that got derailed was 12, including one pantry car and 11 passenger coaches.

Government Railway Police later registered an FIR over the incident.

Of the 20 dead, the bodies of 11 have been identified, said a spokesperson of the Uttar Pradesh government.

Most of the injured have been shifted to Meerut.

“The number of dead may go up as reports say that several of them are critical,” said Principal Secretary Information Avanish Awasthi.

He, however, denied reports appearing in a section of the media about several customers at a tea tall also being crushed under the flying bogies.

Four NDRF teams of skilled personnel equipped with sophisticated gas cutters, airlifting bags and other rescues material have, meanwhile, completed the work of rescue.

In a tweet, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said: “Rescue operations completed. Have directed railway doctors to visit the injured in hospitals and ensure best possible medical help.”

According to the DGP office ADG Meerut Zone Divisional Commissioner Meerut, IG Saharanpur and IF Railways are at the spot.

Also, dispatched are 12 companies of PAC, 90 ambulances, 100 food packets and state-run and private buses to ferry the passengers stranded at the accident site.

However, a large number of passengers still looking for their missing family members do not know where to go to look for them.

Speaking to news channels, eyewitnesses and local residents continue to blame the Railways for the accident.

Pointing towards the several wrenches, hammers and pieces of track at the accident site, they claimed that workers had been working at a damaged section of the track since Saturday morning.

Eyewitnesses say that the workers had left a little while before the accident after it started raining.

While a dozen trains on the Meerut route have been diverted, two trains – the Janshabdi Express and Puri-bound Utkal Express – have been cancelled. Muzaffarnagar authorities have set up a control room to assist families of those affected. The numbers are: 0131- 2436918, 0131-2436103 and 0131-2436564."
Iceland in a nutshell,"The landscapes, seascapes, lava fields, glacier and hiking trails of Snaefellsnes Peninsula make it worth exploring

Kanika Kalia

There is no doubt that Iceland is one of the most beautiful and traveller-friendly destinations in the world. Its dynamic landscape, mystery of geysers, legends of Vikings and beauty of northern lights has captivated travellers for years now. While most people visiting Iceland straightway shoot to the Golden Circle and south Iceland, the Snaefellsnes peninsula in west Iceland is truly a hidden gem just waiting to be explored. Why Snæfellsnes? Well for starters, it is a true testament to Iceland’s dynamic nature. It has almost everything that Iceland has to offer: breathtaking landscapes, alluring seascapes, lava fields, glacier, abandoned farms, and great hiking trails. No surprise that it’s often called ‘Iceland in a nutshell’. It makes for a great destination for a day trip (and even multiple if you have time). This is a much-less visited corner of Iceland compared to the typical touristy areas of the South Coast, and that being said, you will have some areas exclusive to yourself. Now, of course, in winters trying to explore this whole area in a day is literally like racing against the time. But if you have made up your mind and set off for a day of exploring, these tips will help you in planning.

Rent a car at the airport in Keflavík. This is the most convenient way of exploring the area. Though there are some tour companies that offer day trips to Snaefellsnes Peninsula , it will be best to drive it by yourself and do it at your own pace.

Depending on the number of days you intend to spend, base yourself out of Reykjavik.

According to google maps, the entire loop starting and ending at Reykjavik is almost about 500 km and takes six hours if you drive non-stop. But since there are so many scenic viewpoints and you are bound to make frequent stops, it will easily take 10-12 hours to explore the peninsular region.

For all you winter explorers, start your day early so that you may cover maximum in daylight.

There are not many restaurants in this area, so do not forget to pack lunch.

Fill your gas tank as and when you see a gas station. In winters, not all gas stations are open and you may not find one for hours.

Make sure you keep an eye on the weather and road conditions.

If you take the route via Hvalfjordur bay, you will have to pay the toll 100ISK. You can pay by card or in cash.

Things to see:

You can drive through Snaefellsnes Peninsula starting from Reykjavik in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction, provided you reach the Kirkjufell mountain before sunset to enjoy a gem of the view. For this sole reason, it is recommended to drive anti-clockwise in winters. But Kirkjufell is not the only thing to see in this area. Here is list of stoppages you can make in your journey.

Mt. Helgafell: An easy 15-20 minute hike up Mt. Helgafell will reward you with a beautiful view. Legend says if you hike up Mt Helgafell keeping mum and not looking back, your three wishes come true. Definitely worth a try.

Eldborg volcanic caldera: A dirt road from the highway will take you to the closest parking spot near the crater. From there, it is about 15 to 20 minutes hike up.

Gerðuberg Basalt Columns: The beautiful hill gives an illusion of being on the sets of Game of Thrones. These basalt columns are nature’s masterpiece and give an illusion of castle’s fortification.

Bjarnarhöfn Shark Museum: This museum is not like any ordinary museum at all. What makes it unique? Well coupled with randomness and shabby appearance, this place will tell you about an intriguing Icelandic snack, fermented shark, called hákarl. Of course, you can’t leave the place without trying this peculiar delicacy.

Berserkjahraun (Lava field): While driving on Route 54, you will see lava field on both sides of the road. The landscape is breathtaking. To enjoy the beauty of these lava fields, you have two options. You can park your car somewhere near Berserkjahraunvegur road and go for a long walk. Or you can take a dirt road and explore it by car. If you do it by car, make sure your car has good tyres.

Vatnshellir: The 8000-year-old volcanic cave is bound to leave you speechless. There is only one way to explore this cave, and that is taking a group tour. In winters, this place often gets closed.

Kolgrafarfjördur Fjord: This fjord is known for the maximum concentration of marine life. In year 2003-4, there had been an incident of mass death of marine life in this fjord because of lack of oxygen and since then, it has been a popular stop for visitors. The area is beautiful and definitely worth spending some time and taking beautiful pictures.

Kirkujafell Mountain: The Kirkujafell Mountain is the climax of journey of Snaefellsnes Peninsula. It is the most photographed mountain of Iceland. When you reach this spot, you will understand God’s perfect set up: waterfall, mountain, sea — all in one sight. And if you are lucky, you will also find Icelandic horses running in the barn. Keep in mind that parking lot is small at this spot, so it does take some amount of waiting as this place remains crowded. For photographers, you will have to be in line to get the chance to photograph the mountain from the perfect angle."
Amendments to deal with today’s ills,"CONSUMER BEWARE!

Pushpa Girimaji

Is it true that the Reserve Bank of India has amended the Banking Ombudsman Scheme to expand its jurisdiction? If so, can you please give some details?

Yes, the 2017 amendment to the Banking Ombudsman scheme has widened the scope of the scheme and brought under the ambit of the Ombudsman, a number of hitherto excluded issues pertaining to the banking operations.

To be more specific, the amendments finally provide for redress of a large number of highly vexatious problems faced by bank customers in recent years such as fraudulent withdrawal of money through electronic banking as well as stolen and cloned debit and credit cards, besides mis-selling of insurance, mutual funds and other investment products. Similarly, the amendments have also brought under the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman issues such as erroneous reporting of credit information to the Credit Information Bureau and the failure to rectify such factual inaccuracies. These are all issues on account of which consumers have for long suffered not just financial loss but also harassment and mental anguish. And in the absence of any redress at the ombudsman level, they have had to fight long battles before the consumer court. Finally, consumers can seek resolution of their disputes in these matters through the Ombudsman.

The revised ombudsman scheme, which came into effect from July 1 this year, includes in the list of ‘Grounds for complaint’, non-adherence to the instructions of the Reserve Bank vis-à-vis mobile banking/electronic banking services in respect of delay or failure to effect online payment or fund transfer and unauthorised electronic payment/fund transfer . Similarly, one can complain against banks for sale of unsuitable, improper financial products such as insurance and mutual funds, besides lack of transparency in such sale and delay in facilitating after sales service.

Another positive change brought about in the Ombudsman Scheme is the provision to award compensation for harassment and mental anguish, besides loss of the complainant’s time and other expenses, up to a limit of Rs 1 lakh. Despite the low limit, I really welcome this because earlier the Scheme provided for such compensation only in cases of credit card operations. So, extending this to all complaints is really good. Second, the compensation awarded for any loss suffered as a direct consequence of the bank’s omission or commission (or the pecuniary jurisdiction to pass an award) has been raised from Rs 10 lakh to 20 lakh.

Are there any pre-conditions that one must remember while filing a complaint before the Ombudsman?

One of the most important conditions is the requirement of the complainant going to the Ombudsman only after exhausting the complaint redress system available with the bank. The Scheme requires the complainant to first write to the bank (preferably the nodal officer) and approach the ombudsman only if there is no response within a month or if the response is not satisfactory. Consumers must remember this because a number of cases before the Ombudsmen are rejected for this reason.

Otherwise, filing a complaint before the Ombudsman is easy — you can even send it electronically. You do not need any lawyer and the process of resolution of the complaint is very simple. First and foremost, the Ombudsman will try to promote a settlement through conciliation or mediation between the parties and if it is agreeable to the complainant, will pass an order. If not, the Ombudsman will pass an award after giving both the parties an opportunity to present their case. One can also file an appeal against the order of the Ombudsman before the Appellate Authority.

The complaint has to be filed before the Ombudsman under whose jurisdiction the bank branch concerned is situated. However, in case of credit card and other types of services with centralised operations, a complaint can be filed before the Ombudsman under whose territorial jurisdiction the billing address of the complainant is located. You can get the details of the scheme as well as the addresses of the 20 Ombudsmen in the country from the website of the Reserve Bank of India."

KULLU, AUGust 19

Himachal Congress in-

charge and AICC general secretary Sushil Kumar Shinde said today that there were no differences among party workers. Addressing members during a District Congress Committee meeting here, he said there were misunderstanding among some top leaders and these would be removed after dialogues. He also warned the party leaders to refrain from making comments in public which would become news headlines and damage the party’s reputation. Shinde was struggling hard to unite the party, which was divided in factions and top leaders were busy to pin down each other from the public platform. Yesterday, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh indirectly hit his detractors from the dais at Mandi by saying, “I am not Aya Ram or Gaya Ram who come and go in the party to reap the benefits or get posts.” Commenting on the Modi government, he said the Central Government had promised to provide jobs to 2 crore people, but over 1 crore people lost their jobs due to demonetisation. He said there were no differences among Congress workers. He appealed to the members to stay united to win the upcoming Assembly elections. He said everyone should ensure to support the candidates who were given the party ticket. Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh said, “We should sink differences and work united to win the coming elections.” He said Kullu was the stronghold of the Congress and the party would suffer if two candidates of the party contest from the seat. He administered oath to members to stand united and apprise the masses about development in Kullu and the state. HPCC president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, former minister Satya Prakash Thakur, HPCC general secretary Sunder Singh Thakur, Himachal Youth Congress president Vikramaditya Singh and many other leaders also spoke on the occasion."

"First ODI: Dhawan, Kohli star as India rout Sri Lanka by 9 wickets","Power-packed innings from Shikhar Dhawan and skipper Virat Kohli guided India to a comfortable nine-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in their first One Day International (ODI) at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium here on Sunday.

Dhawan slammed 132 runs in 90 balls while Kohli smashed 82 runs off 70 deliveries. Both players forged a 197-run partnership for the second wicket, the highest in Sri Lanka against Sri Lanka.

It all went well for India in this match. After a little bit of punishment initially, their bowlers bounced back in style to restrict the hosts for 216 and then Dhawan and Kohli applied themselves perfectly to chase down the total with 21.1 overs (127 balls) remaining. This also helped them to record their biggest win, in terms of overs to spare, for a target of over 200.

Coming in to chase a relatively low total, openers Rohit Sharma and Dhawan started the innings on a steady note but Rohit failed to support the Delhi batsman for long as he was dismissed in the fifth over with barely 23 runs on the board.

Incoming batsman and skipper Kohli, along with Dhawan, then paced up the innings by thrashing the Sri Lankan bowlers all around the park. It was raining boundaries in the ground and stopped only after they reached the target. Dhawan slammed 20 boundaries and three sixes while Kohli hit 10 boundaries and one six.

Earlier, Sri Lanka wasted a good start to allow Indian spinners to bounce back in style and restrict the hosts to 216.

For Sri Lanka, openers Niroshan Dickwella (64) and Anjelo Mathews (36 not out) were the major contributors to the cause.

Unlike the Test series, which the hosts lost 0-3, Sri Lanka started the limited overs campaign on a good note as their top order stood up to the occasion. The top three batsmen maintained a perfect run-rate till the halfway-mark of the allotted 50 overs.

India's ploy to use pacer Jasprit Bumrah as the first change also failed as all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who was brought in for Bumrah, was smashed by the Sri Lankan batman. Pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar also failed to click this time.

But soon, after 12 overs, when the spinners were introduced, it was India gaining the upper edge as the Sri Lankan batsman found it difficult to tackle them.

After Indian skipper Virat Kohli won the toss and put Sri Lanka in to bat, Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka gave the perfect start to their team as both forged a 74-run partnership in 14 overs before the latter was sent back to the pavilion by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal (74/1).

Unperturbed by the fall of Gunathilaka's wicket, incoming batsman Kusal Mendis (36) along with Dickwella continued the pace and built up a 65-run stand for the second wicket. But just when things seemed good in the middle, Dickwella was adjudged leg before wicket off Kedar Jadhav in the 25th over (139/2).

It was just after Dickwella's wicket that the Sri Lankans lost the plot and started losing their wickets at regular intervals. Apart from the top-three batsmen, no other player stood up to the Indian pressure and went back to the pavilion one by one.

Anjelo Mathews (36 not out) somehow managed to stick at the wicket but lack of support from the other end resulted in a low total for the hosts.

Mathews apart, other middle-order batsmen Upul Tharanga (13), Chamara Kapugedera (1) Wanidu Hasaranga (2) scored a total of 16 runs only.

Lower-order players Thisara Perera (0), Lakshan Sandakan (5) and Lasith Malinga (8) tried to make up for the middle-order collapse but failed and thus, after a perfect start, the Islanders were restricted to 216.

For India, left-arm spinner Axar Patel scalped three wickets while Bumrah, Chahal and Jadhav took two wickets each. IANS"

Tribune News Service

Panchkula, August 19

The presence of as many as 3,000 Dera followers outside the Panchkula district courts complex took the administration by surprise today.

The turnout was unexpected if inputs received by the police are to be believed.

The followers from different parts of Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh gathered outside the courts complex for the hearing in the murder case against Dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in the CBI court today. Senior police officials, including the DSPs, did not allow any Dera follower to enter the complex.

They latter had reached Panchkula in private buses, tractors, cars and also on Haryana Roadways buses from Ambala to Panchkula. Their vehicles were parked at different places in Sector 1.

After the hearing, they returned to their respective places, saying they would again come in large numbers on August 25, the day the special CBI court will pronounce its verdict in the rape case against the Dera chief.

Dalbir Singh, a follower, who had come from Ambala, said the Dera head had been implicated and that they would come again on August 25.

Another follower Ramesh said they would be present on both sides of road from Sirsa to Panchkula on the day. They would not tolerate anything against the Dera chief, he said. Meanwhile, sources in the Police Department claimed that many followers were still in the town.

Cops on alert

Panchkula Police Commissioner AS Chawla said they had received inputs about the presence of Dera followers. “Police personnel deployed outside the courts complex did not allow any follower to enter the premises,” he said. An anti-sabotage team with a sniffer dog and a bomb disposal squad will be deployed outside the court on Sunday. Also, the manpower will be increased.

DC meets officials

Panchkula DC Gauri Parashar Joshi met district administration officials. She asked them to cancel employees’ leave till August 30.

Hearing deferred

The CBI special court on Saturday deferred the hearing in the murder case against the Dera head to September 16.

Exports to Nepal: Refund of IGST permissible,"TAX ADVICE

SC Vasudeva

The goods and services can be exported either on payment of IGST which can be claimed as refund after the goods have been exported, or under bond or Letter of Understanding (LUT) without payment of IGST.

In case of goods and services exported under bond or LUT, the exporter can claim refund of accumulated ITC on account of exports.

In case of goods, the shipping bill is the only document required to be filed with the Customs for making exports. Requirement of filing ARE 1/ARE 2 has been done away with.

The supplies made for export are to be made under self-sealing and self-certification without any intervention of the departmental officer.

The shipping bill filed with the Customs is treated as an application for refund of IGST and shall be deemed to have been filed after submission of export general manifest and furnishing of a valid return in Form GSTR-3 by the applicant.

Climate change is not merely a much talked about subject anymore. It has started manifesting itself rather cruelly. Unseasonal heavy rains and floods are no longer abnormal. Every year, several parts of the country face unprecedented rain that causes mayhem in peoples’ lives. The constant lash of rain causes floods in several regions of India causing numerous deaths, health hazards, damage to automobiles and property.

Be prepared

While natural calamities are unpredictable and unavoidable, it is imperative that we keep ourselves prepared for such eventualities with effective loss-minimisation measures. However, there could still be financial losses due to damage to property which cannot be avoided altogether. Insurance provides effective solution in terms of mitigating such losses by providing adequate compensation.

Property, motor insurance

While life and health insurance covers are vital for every human being, it is essential to include property and motor insurance as an integral component of your financial planning.

Few things in life matter as much to us, as our home does. Any damage to this can cause financial as well as emotional setback. While emotional setback is in the realm of the mind, only an appropriate insurance for property can safeguard one from financial setback. Apart from the building itself, the contents and other valuables in the house can also be protected through a home insurance cover. Usually, property insurance provides coverage against natural calamities such as fire, explosion and implosion, earthquake, lightning, storm, cyclone, tempest, tornado, hurricane, flood and inundation, subsidence, landslides and rockslides.

Property/home insurance policies are not solutions for natural calamities alone. They offer compensation for losses arising out of a number of other eventualities. They provide coverage against fire, burglary/housebreaking and natural calamities, losses or damages to domestic and electronic appliances and portable equipment, such as laptops, liabilities like tenants’ legal liability, domestic workers compensation and public liability.

During floods, automobiles are partially or completely submerged in water and citizens struggle with ways to recover their vehicle.

Innovative solutions

People in flood-prone areas find it difficult to get their cars towed away and delivered to workshops and dealers. Additionally, they are also charged higher parking fee by dealers (approx. Rs 11,000) and even higher by recovery van dealers just to get their cars towed away to a garage or workshop.

These are times when insurers stretch themselves to offer timely and innovative solutions to mitigate the miseries of the customer. Insurers not only provide financial support for repairing your car but also can help you with valuable tips to avoid further aggravation of the loss or damage to the car.

Add-on covers

What is important is that you should not delay reporting your vehicle to the nearest workshop. The list of workshops can be availed from your insurer itself. It is advisable to purchase additional protection by way of add-on insurance covers, which can be added to your current policy at minimal cost. Add-on covers like engine protector/hydrostatic lock cover will cover you against losses to engine due to water ingression.

Right insurance cover

To buy the right insurance policies to cover your property and vehicle, especially during natural calamities, you need to evaluate various policies available in the market before signing on the dotted line. Gather all information on the policy and the insurer to understand their reputation in the market, particularly the speed of claim settlement. Be aware of the inclusions and exclusions of the policy so that you can have an appropriate mix of all that you require. Inexpensive covers may leave out some key coverage that is crucial for full protection. Look for available insurance riders. The insurance company that you approach may be able to offer you extra coverage especially for valuable items like jewellery.

Time to take a call

Timing, too, is important when it comes to disaster insurance. It is important that you may not be given a cover against a natural disaster when one is in the offing. Always remember to read the contents of the insurance policy. Do ensure that you purchase the policy from an insurer with a good claim settlement record. Think about the security and amity that the insurance protection will offer.

There are two types of people in the world — the doers and the rest. Times when Mother Earth is witnessing abnormal climatic conditions and concrete jungles are fast replacing the green cover; some doers are working relentlessly to make things better for themselves, the rest and the rest of the rest. They are the ones who cared to stop by, smelled the roses, ploughed their own fields, then someone else's till their acts became contagious and sparked a movement. Here's to the everyday eco-heroes who refused to be non-participants, who started as one-man armies, faced the heat and still ushered in positive changes. Now in the latter part of their lives, these persons promise to leave the world a greener and finer place.

Jungle all the way

Jagat Singh Chaudhary, a BSF soldier, had just been home on leave in the fall of 1973 when a village woman, out to get fodder, fell down a mountain and sustained fatal injuries. The incident might have been unfortunate in every way, but it wasn't anything new for Kot Malla and many other villages of Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, where trekking to treacherous heights for essentials like water and fodder was part of every woman's daily routine.

The incident kept the young soldier up all night. The rest of his holidays were spent finding ways to improve the plight of the womenfolk of his village. Little did he know that what he would eventually start as an unfeigned attempt to provide respite to his fellow villagers would one day earn him a special name.

Chaudhary decided to grow plants on a wasteland his father owned, which was not just barren, but also uneven and stony. In 1980, he decided to hang up his boots and started cultivating these two barren hectares. Since no water was available in the vicinity, Jagat would walk 3 km daily, carrying water pots on his shoulders. His unbridled enthusiasm was infectious. Many others were inspired to go the ‘Jungli ‘way. Jungli was the name villagers gave the retired soldier.

After turning an unyielding land into a jungle of mixed plants, Jungli started planting cash crops such as ginger, turmeric, pulses, vegetables and herbs, which not only benefited the environment, but also provided livelihood to people.

Suman Saurabh, a Delhi university student, made Jungli’s work the focus of his post-graduation thesis. “There are very few people who're doing the real work. I came to know about Jagat sir from my professor. A visit to his jungle in Rudraprayag was so inspirational that I decided to study it further,” maintains Suman.

In 2007, Chaudhary was invited by HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, to develop a model forest on the campus, which he did till 2010.

He’s been undertaking plantation activities using wood, stone and pit technology. Now 70, ‘Jungli’ says he wants to save the future generations from the ill-effects of environment change; that’s why all the efforts.

Chamba's Chipko campaigner

Sunderlal Bahuguna’s Chipko Movement of 1981 offered meaning and purpose to many people across the country. Though working for the cause of environment since 1973, the movement marked an important event in the life of Kulbhushan Upmanyu of Kamla village in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh, who marched from Kashmir to Kohima as part of the movement.

After school, Upmanyu decided to cultivate a piece of land in his village. A small field could not contain this young man’s dream, who refused to turn a blind eye to the problems his fellow villagers faced. Soon, he formed a development group with other villagers in 1973, where they addressed issues of villagers without any government help. He started working towards making the village self-sustainable.

What Bahuguna’s movement gave Upmanyu was a reason to concentrate on forests. He soon became a frontline campaigner in spreading awareness on forest conservation. That time, pine and eucalyptus plantation was under way on a large scale in Himachal, a dangerous practice which was set to jeopardise the ecosystem of the region and put villages in a major fodder crisis. Upmanyu stood up against the destructive move and launched a campaign. His consistent efforts bore fruit and after a seven-year fight, eucalyptus plantation was banned on the government land across the state and pine plantation was majorly discouraged. Owing to his endeavours to protect forests in the years to follow, oaks and rhododendron were declared protected in Himachal.

“It's important to focus on two things — plantation and systematic waste disposal. In plantation, we have to bring in more multi-purpose species and avoid pine and eucalyptus. There's also a need to learn the scientific ways of garbage disposal. The authorities should adopt the European model of waste disposal, which almost eliminates the chances of pollution,” says Upmanyu.

“I have always been interested in forestry. About five-six years ago, I met Upmanyu ji and joined him. He's been working for the preservation of forests for decades and his contribution is inspirational,” says Ranjeet of Chamba.

For many years, Upmanyu has been running an NGO — Himalaya Bachao Samiti. He now usually takes up advocacy work, but that, by no means, stops him from daily escapades into the wild.

The eco-warrior from Marathaland

When Ravi Purandre landed in India after spending the prime years of his life in the Gulf, he threw away his passport to purposely banish the temptation to travel any further.

Besides the warmth and love of his family, returning home to Pune also meant starting anew and finding a job. While still looking for one, he would unpremeditatedly wander off to Hanuman Tekdi — a bleak and lifeless hill, which had long been a haven for gamblers and drunkards.

The year was 1999, the hill was barren and Purandre had an idea whose time had come. He wanted to make Hanuman Tekdi green. He started planting saplings on the hill. Soon he met Srikant Paranjpe, who had already been working in this direction. “Together we started planting saplings and making trenches to harvest rainwater,” says Purandre, as he recalls the onset of the journey.

“One day, I saw NCC cadets practising for the RD parade at the Symbiosis College ground. When you have an unwavering commitment to your work, it's almost impossible not to connect it with everything you see. So yes, I saw these spirited children sweating it out and realised there was little that could match their verve and vibrancy. I wanted to rope in children and bring them to the hill for helping us. But above all, I believed that we, adults, had a responsibility that ran deeper than our subjective goals. It is not only wise, but also indispensable to inculcate regard and respect for nature in our young ones,” he asserts.

Pune schools and colleges, too, realised there was a wide scope for EVS activities at the once insipid Hanuman Tekdi. “We'd have youngsters working, laughing and eating together all day. It never felt like work,” says Purandre.

All along, the facelift of the hill was a matter inspiring enough to pique the curiosity of Pune residents, who now started dotting the hill for their walk.

In 2004, his group started getting support from the Pune Municipal Corporation.

“Moving ahead, we started making coco peat using a shredder, which I, being a mechanical engineer, designed myself. Once crushed, coco peat is used for mulching. It retains moisture like nothing else. A complete waste for the city, coconut shells were a treasure for our plants,” explains an innovative Purandre.

Pune had been facing a problem of leaf litter for a long time. Purandre came to the rescue, yet again. “Two years ago, we created six tonnes of best-quality compost using leaf litter, putting an end to the problem. Our target is to make 30 tonne compost by the end of this year and I am confident that we'll find the first-of- its-kind leaf shredding solution in India,” he asserts.

Eighteen years have passed since Purandre and his team started rainwater harvesting and plantation on the rocky Hanuman Tekdi. Today, the hill is unrecognisable with green cover over 60 acres. Three heart attacks and a bypass surgery has failed to shake Purandre's resolve. Every morning, he walks up the hill, his steps hard to match, while children from nearby schools flock the area to assist him. “Is it work?” It’s not, they know."
