"Maldives: Army occupies parliament to block no-confidence vote, opposition MPs roughed up","Opposition lawmakers say military siege was an attempt to block no-confidence motion in Parliament. Opposition lawmakers say military siege was an attempt to block no-confidence motion in Parliament.

Maldives‚Äô opposition lawmakers said on Tuesday that the military locked down the nation‚Äôs Parliament in an attempt to block a no-confidence motion to impeach the speaker of the house. They were also allegedly roughed up by military personnel.

Lawmaker Imithiyaz Fahmy from opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) tweeted saying military in plainclothes blocked MPs entering chamber. ‚ÄúSaid MPs cannot enter before 8:55 am. Proceedings begin at 9:00, surrounded by military,‚Äù tweeted Fahmy.

Eva Abdulla, another lawmaker from MDP, said that although the MPs were eventually allowed inside, the Speaker of the house was surrounded by military in plainclothes.

Madlives President Abdulla Yameen has been accused in the past of attempting to reverse democratic progress in a country that became a multiparty democracy relatively recently in 2008. President Yameen had ordered military to barricade the Parliament last month, with reports of frequent scuffle between troops and opposition MPs have taken place in a bid to prevent lawmakers from entering.

Only last month, in an attempt to prevent impeachment, the Maldives military locked the gates of parliament with opposition saying it had majority of votes. While some MPs barged in through the barriers, others were forcibly thrown out. In a statement to the media, the opposition MDP termed President Yameen‚Äôs action as ‚Äúdesperate, illegal and unconstitutional‚Äù.

In July this year, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had urged the government in the Maldives to lift a blockade of parliament and refrain from all acts that result in the harassment and intimidation of lawmakers, civil society and the media.

Guterres voiced concern over ‚Äúgradual erosion of basic democratic norms and principles‚Äù in the country and has urged a dialogue. He called on the government in Maldives ‚Äúto uphold the constitutionally guaranteed rights of speech and assembly‚Äù.

Ronald Koeman expects player and club to benefit from Wayne Rooney decision,"According to Ronald Koeman, Wayne Rooney‚Äôs retirement from International football is the best choice for both, player and the club. (Source: AP) According to Ronald Koeman, Wayne Rooney‚Äôs retirement from International football is the best choice for both, player and the club. (Source: AP)

Wayne Rooney‚Äôs retirement from the England national team is the best choice for both the player and Everton as it allows the 31-year-old more time to recover his fitness during a busy domestic schedule, his club‚Äôs manager Ronald Koeman has said.

Rooney, who rejoined Everton from Manchester United in July, ended his 14-year England career when the country‚Äôs all-time leading scorer announced his international retirement on Wednesday.

Everton hold a 2-0 lead over Hajduk Split from the first leg of their Europa League qualifier and travel to Croatia for the second leg on Thursday. Progression to the group stages, means the Merseyside club will compete in four different competitions.

‚ÄúHe had a talk with the national coach and made his decision, because he thinks it is the best for Everton,‚Äù Koeman told reporters. ‚ÄúIt is always the player‚Äôs decision and, of course, I respect that.

‚ÄúIf you reach the group stage of the Europa League and have international duty, then that is a really tough programme. ‚ÄúHis fitness is really good at the moment‚Ä¶ I think it is a good decision for him and a good decision for Everton. It means when the internationals come, he will have some time at home with his family.‚Äù

Koeman, who earned 78 caps for the Netherlands as a player, also said that he did not advise Rooney, who scored 53 goals for England, on his decision to retire.

Following their Europa League tie, Everton travel to Premier League champions Chelsea on Sunday.

"One for the ages: At 60, Matthew Fogarty keeps coming back at World Championships","Matthew Fogarty with his mother in Glasgow. The American played alongside Nicholas Bonkowssky of Canada in what was his 8th qualification at the World Championships. Matthew Fogarty with his mother in Glasgow. The American played alongside Nicholas Bonkowssky of Canada in what was his 8th qualification at the World Championships.

Matthew Fogarty is 60 and has qualified for the World Championships ‚Äî his 8th. The American from Boston had qualified in 2003 at Anaheim ‚Äî based on his rankings (which is now 93), but the US Federation did not allow him to play because he was 47 then.

He continued to qualify for the Worlds thereafter, arriving this time again with a much younger Canadian Nicholas Bonkowssky (29) as partner after his age-sake Dean Shoppe had accompanied him for three Worlds. Fogarty, on warpath with his federation, is keen to expose the ‚Äúcorruption and unfairness‚Äù of his national body, and makes it a point to keep his ranking within qualification limits.

‚ÄúI used to play as a kid because my grandparents and parents played near Boston. Then I had to stop because I went to med school. But I continued playing,‚Äù he recounts. ‚ÄúThen some years ago they told me I was too old.‚Äù

What no one could stop was him making the Worlds ‚Äî with only two teams per country permitted. This time, they qualified after the withdrawal of several doubles teams, rubbing in the nose of the American Federation once again.

Travelling with his mum ‚Äî she‚Äôs in her 80s now though she used to play as his partner till two decades ago ‚Äî Fogarty would enjoy Glasgow, make it a point to annoy officials against whom he riles, before eventually losing 21-2, 21-4 against a Malaysian pair.

When asked if Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei can continue playing, Fogarty says, ‚ÄúI love the science of badminton and I can tell you the equipment is so light that anyone can continue playing as long as they want. I intend to play till I feel like it,‚Äù he asserted. And no one hearing the name Matthew Fogarty in badminton will ever ask, ‚ÄúDr Who?‚Äù

Japan‚Äôs Makoto Hasebe returns for crucial World Cup qualifiers,"Makoto Hasebe has been recalled for Japan‚Äôs crucial World Cup qualifying matches against Australia and Saudi Arabia, after the Eintrqacht Frankfurt midfielder was included in head coach Vahid Halilhodzic‚Äôs squad on Thursday.

Having missed games against the United Arab Emirates, Thailand and Iraq due to surgery on a knee injury, Japan‚Äôs captain has made a full recovery to be selected in Halilhodzic‚Äôs initial 27-man squad.

‚ÄúThere are a number of players I am concerned about and I have done this because I don‚Äôt want to take risks. I want to look first-hand at the players I have got and see what the possibilities are,‚Äù Halilhodzic was reported as saying by Kyodo News.

The former Algeria coach has also recalled Getafe midfielder Gaku Shibasaki as well as striker Yoshinori Muto, while there are fitness concerns over Yuya Osako, Keisuke Honda and Shinji Kagawa.

Japan lead Group B of Asia‚Äôs qualifying competition for the tournament in Russia next year by a solitary point and victory over Australia on Aug. 31 would secure a place in the World Cup finals for a sixth successive time.

However, with the Australians and Saudi Arabia only a point behind, Halilhodzic‚Äôs side cannot afford to slip up or risk being forced to continue their qualification quest via a series of playoffs.

‚ÄúWe started the final round of qualifiers on the wrong foot (with a 2-1 home defeat to UAE last September) but we are top of the group,‚Äù Halilhodzic said.

‚ÄúI hear the recent criticism directed my way and it puts pressure on me but this is the kind of situation I like. The more I come under attack and the more criticism I face, the more determined I am to respond.‚Äù

Tri Nation-series: India win tournament despite draw against St Kitts and Nevis,"India vs St Kitts and Nevis: India play against St. Kitts and Nevis, the third team in the tournament (Source: Twitter) India vs St Kitts and Nevis: India play against St. Kitts and Nevis, the third team in the tournament (Source: Twitter)

India started the match confidently as they eyed their 10th straight win after they beat Mauritius 2-1 in the ongoing Hero Tri-Nation Football tournament, which has been organised to help the hosts prepare for Asian Cup qualifiers against Macau on 5 September. However, they did not get the desired end results as the hosts failed to convert a lot of easy chances. It was St Kitts and Nevis second draw in the tournament as they were previously held to a 1-1 draw by lower-ranked Mauritius in their opening encounter. India‚Äôs Jackichand Singh scored a goal for the hosts in the 38th minute to give them a lead. Even though the Blue Tigers had multiple chances to double the lead, off-target shots stole the chance from India. St Kitts and Nevis‚Äô Gvaune Amory equalised to make it 1-1 against India with 15 minutes of the game remaining. India‚Äôs keeper Subrata Paul needs to be credited for helping India not lose the match after he saved a number of shots on target from the opposition side.

India vs St Kitts and Nevis:

2153 IST: Full time! And the thrilling match comes to an end with a draw. Howver, the hosts win the tournament as they previously beat Mauritius, who ended their second match in a draw. India is the only team that managed to win a game in the Tri-nation series.

2142 IST: So close yet so far. Deflection for India as the ball hits the post, denying the hosts a chance to win the match with just a few minutes remaining.

2136 IST: Substitution as Anirudh Thapa comes in for Rowllin. This is Thapa‚Äôs debut in the senior team. Last ten minutes of the game. Will there be a winner?

2129 IST: Goal! St Kitts and Nevis‚Äô Amory makes it 1-1 against India with 15 minutes of the game remaining. The goal comes after two brilliant saves from Subrata.

2128 IST: Stephen Constantine‚Äôs men win seven corners in comparison to just 1 of St Kitts but need to work on converting them successfully.

2121 IST: Offside! Another play by Robin ends up offside. St Kitts try to make a comeback but the Indian defenders stand tall against them.

2118 IST: Substitution for the hosts as Nikhil Poojary comes in for goalscorer Jacki. Rafique comes in for Eugeneson.

2117 IST: Substitution for St Kitts and Nevis as Tiran comes in for Tishan.

2111 IST: Robin has brought a new energy to his side as India create chances with amazing playskills. However, the Indians need to word harder on targets as their shoots go awfully wide. No point creating chances if you can‚Äôt convert them.

2105 IST: What skills by Jhingan as he was very close to scoring his first goal for team India. India showcase beautiful skills for the second time in two minutes but fail to convert.

2100 IST: Second half begins with St Kitts and Nevis attack. Close shave for India as the ball goes slightly over the board. Robin Singh comes in for Balwant.

2046 IST: HALF-TIME

Jeje failed to double the lead with multiple close shaves for India as keeper Subrata displays good efforts to keep the ball out of the net. Both Jackichand‚Äôs goals for India have now come at the Mumbai Football Arena!

2038 IST: GOAL A superb header from Jackichand sends the ball flying inside the net after Rowllin Borges curls in a perfect assist. Jeje could have doubled the lead but the opposition goalkeeper managed to save it.

2035 IST: A foul on Narayan and referee awards the free-kick as the possession is back with the visitors. The good thing for India is that they have not conceded a single goal till now.

Encounters In The Dark,"DG Vanzara. (File Photo) DG Vanzara. (File Photo)

Encounters are safe bets for risk-averse policemen. Get information, know the car or of bus the terrorist is travelling in, drag him out, make him ‚Äúsing‚Äù and shoot the blighter. The boss, a DIG no less, will pat your back. But here the DIG, D.G. Vanzara, was himself involved. Who can pat a DIG except the home minister. And after a decade-old war in the press, we find the court ‚Äúdischarging‚Äù the accused.

People in Gujarat can‚Äôt make out what the hullabaloo is about ‚Äî this talk of genuine and spurious encounters. As long as you shoot the guy, all encounters are genuine, pal. So people were happy, hearing that the CBI court discharged Vanzara and another officer of all guilt. Your premier investigating agency, under orders and supervision of the highest court, charged the accused. The least one expected was that the matter would come up for trial. Cyberspace is full of papers on the subject. It is even alleged that Kauser Bi, Sohrabuddin‚Äôs wife was raped, strangled and cremated.

All this is possibly false, but the court, after hearing evidence on both sides, should give a verdict. The accusations can be false, but the ‚Äúdischarge‚Äù on the face of it, is one-sided. Remember the Malegaon bomb blast cases and the statement of the fine prosecutor Rohini Salian that she was pressurised to go slow against Pragya Thakur and Shrikant Purohit, now on bail. I should know something about encounters. As UP‚Äôs only Assistant Inspector General, I wrote citations for gallantry medals, I employed my poetic hyperbole. Most inspectors claimed that the dacoit‚Äôs bullet passed through their side cap. One guy wrote the bullet passed through his muffler. Such originality was not lost on me.

I wrote a thumping proposal, something like, ‚ÄúUncaring for life and limb Inspector Shyam Awasthi or Ram Khilawan or Ram Bharosay charged and braving the fusillade of lead spouting from bandit guns grappled with miscreants, captured two of them, apart from murdering (sorry) shooting in self-defence, three of them.‚Äù Something in that order. In two postings in Chambal area I have had occasion to be involved in encounters.

In one of them the dacoits were favoured by a sandstorm and escaped. We had taken up positions in a barren field and the raging sand went straight for our eyes. It was a pitch dark night. I was asked by a subordinate if we could kill the informer (a former member of this really notorious gang), because we had nothing to show for a truck load of police moving into Rajasthan. I remember I just said ‚Äúno‚Äù. No hysterics, no swear words at the abominable suggestion.

After that an officer placed his light machine gun and emptied about three magazines firing at an empty haveli at ten o‚Äôclock at night. He later bagged a gallantry medal for some genuine anti-dacoity heroics he was surely involved in. I went to Zimbabwe/Rhodesia as a member of the Commonwealth observers team for the 1980 elections, which ushered in Robert Mugabe. Sigh. Guerrillas had played havoc for seven years. The ANC was trained by the Chinese, incidentally. I went on anti-mine vehicles on roads which had not been used for five years. The white police used the word ‚Äúcontact‚Äù instead of our desi ‚Äúencounter‚Äù.

So Zimbabwe police had ‚Äúcontacts‚Äù (meaning gun duels) with ‚Äúterrs‚Äù, their term for terrorists. Same syndrome, but a change in nouns. To have elections cancelled outright, police planted a bomb in a bus, killing a few people. What are a few lives when the white nation‚Äôs cause was at stake? They thought they were doing it for a national cause. When it comes to national security, as it did in Gujarat, there can‚Äôt be any compromises, isn‚Äôt it?

If the government wants ‚Äî and neither the Centre, nor the Gujarat government want it ‚Äî it could do the following: Magisterial inquests which are mandatory after ‚Äúencounters‚Äù, should be rigorous, and not an eyewash. The distance between the shooter and the victim is a giveaway. Was he or she shot from at least 20 or 30 yards? Let the inquest be forensically-aided; lessen the reward quotient on ‚Äúheads‚Äù. For instance, Rs 50,000 for taking the man alive, and just 10,000 for the dacoit or terrorist killed. Rewards for heads smells of barbarism; in police training colleges brand fake encounters as something despicable, dishonourable.

Srijan scam: ‚ÄòNo one can imagine manner in which govt funds were siphoned off‚Äô,"Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti Limited. (File Photo) Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti Limited. (File Photo)

The Srijan scam in Bihar looks deeply entrenched, involving government officials, bank employees, business people, and those with political affiliations. Manoj Kumar, Bhagalpur‚Äôs Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) who is heading the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the case, tells Indian Express about the case, and the leads from the probe so far.

Excerpts from the interview:

Now that the CBI is likely to take over Srijan scam investigation any time, what are the vital leads from the SIT‚Äôs investigation so far?

We have so far arrested 18 people ‚Äî these include the district cooperative officer and the district welfare officer, besides the district magistrate‚Äôs stenographer and two bank officers. The investigation so far suggests connivance of government officials and bank officials with Srijan to transfer government funds in a planned manner, and dupe district administration and auditors with tampered bank statements prepared by Srijan founder-secretary Manorama Devi.

The investigation has two parts: how Srijan got government funds, and (second) where she (Manorama Devi) pumped the funds and through whom‚Ä¶. The illegal funds transfer and embezzlement (is) to the tune of Rs 624 crore, as assessed through nine FIRs.

Read: Probing ‚Äòshadow investments‚Äô, Bhagalpur SIT looks for two political leaders

How do you categorise this kind of economic fraud?

This is quite unheard of ‚Äî perhaps the first of its kind. It is a classic test-case for investigators. No one can imagine the manner in which government funds were siphoned off in a sustained manner without getting detected by auditors.

What are the documents you are looking at? What is the strength of the SIT?

Documents range from government orders, transactions, bank statements and Srijan‚Äôs accounts since its inception. It is voluminous. We have a devoted team of 30 people to investigate the matter. Until the CBI takes over, we will continue to dig out as much facts as we can.

Can you cite the method of a bulk transfer of funds to Srijan account to explain the modus operandi?

Say, once a government cheque is issued to a bank saying ‚Äúpay yourself‚Äù, the amount is originally meant to be deposited in bank account of a particular district fund. The back of the cheque would mention ‚Äúin the sweep‚Äù, which means that after a cap of amount in the account, the rest of the money deposited would be given a fixed-deposit interest. In normal terms, this is called flexi FD. But there was a catch here. The overleaf of cheque would mention a bank account, which would be of Srijan in the same bank and not one of the government.

The other method of transfer (was) through cheques. Only forensic examination will reveal the veracity of cheques and the signatures on them. Has the investigation suggested connections of Srijan representatives with powerful people? The investigation is still at very early stage and we need corroborative evidence. As we are getting leads, we are conducting raids, detaining and arresting people.

Which people are under your scanner?

Revealing that would alert them. Our list is growing as new facts emerge and new links come up.

Given Manorama Devi‚Äôs clout among bureaucrats and politicians, have you got any leads on her big connection in the scam?

Not so far. We have conducted raids at places of two politicians. We are doing a review of seizures from various raids. We are trying to find out what can be incriminating. We have also raided premises of two Bhagalpur business (persons) and an auditor with Srijan.

What they didn‚Äôt tell you: Coming out is a never-ending process,"What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar) What do we do with the freedom? Do we let it consume us? (Illustration: Subrata Dhar)

What do you want to be when you grow up?‚Äù a ninth grade English paper once asked me. It was a 20-mark essay, and I had 20 minutes to earn them. I rolled up my sleeves, and pulled out my cursive best.

The thing is, I wanted to be a great many things.I wanted to be a chef, an actor, a painter; I wanted to be an astronaut, and, for two weeks after I turned 11, I wanted to be a National Geographic correspondent ‚Äî if only because my older sister said that she wanted to be one. From the age of six to 16, I raced through changes. My styles, my sexual leanings and my haircuts changed, and so did my dreams.Only, what did I never dream of being? Myself.

I was so used to pushing my problems under a hypothetical carpet, that I never realised the lies I was hoarding. It was an easy, lazy life. Through adolescence, I used this complacency as a security blanket, and wound it around myself whenever thoughts of the future terrified me. What would coming out (as a gay man) be like? Would I have to talk about my feelings? Would I have someone to talk about my feelings to (a fair question, because I grew up thinking that you were only allowed to talk about your feelings at expensive therapy sessions, sappy book clubs or when watching romantic tearjerkers)?

Growing up signified independence ‚Äî no more staying at home, no more rules, no more restrictions, no more getting worried over your mother‚Äôs 18 missed calls (well, almost). But I didn‚Äôt know what I would do with all the freedom. Independence petrified me. What would I do being free? Would I finally have to be myself?

People are terrified to be themselves, especially when bravery is an option, and not an obligation. I‚Äôve been called manipulative, selfish, a coward and a sore loser. Why would I want to be myself then? I‚Äôd rather be someone nicer and more admirable; I‚Äôd rather be someone else.

Some enjoy the peace that comes with accepting who they are, but most of us get stuck on the fence in the middle. Take sexuality, for instance. We can stir ourselves to walk free and fabulous, but we‚Äôd rather stay safe and sound in the cage of heteronormativity. I made myself feel at home in the cage till I was 21. The thing about independence, though, is that it doesn‚Äôt come gift-wrapped and express delivered to your front doorstep. It needs to be earned, or fought for.

Coming to terms with your sexuality and stepping out of the closet isn‚Äôt easy ‚Äî especially in a country like India, where minds can be as narrow as Bandra‚Äôs bylanes, even if you are an upper-class, well-educated man (and sometimes, especially if you an upper-class, well-educated man). As countless films and American television shows have told us, you don‚Äôt just wake up one morning and walk out into the sunlit world. To reach the closet door, you need to push through your woollens, those ‚Äúbuy-one-get-one-free‚Äù shirts you bought on an impulse, and the odd tangle of smelly socks, greying underwear and smutty novels you don‚Äôt want your mother to find. It will be tough, especially if you‚Äôve been hoarding ‚Äî and holding back ‚Äî all your life.

And even when you do, it‚Äôs a never-ending process. Those closet doors that everyone talks about? They are revolving. Week after week, you will find yourself coming out to friends, family, acquaintances, and (occasionally) drunken strangers at the bar. Perhaps, one day it will not be the big deal that it is today, and you won‚Äôt have to worry about whether your words are followed by a kiss to the cheek or a punch to the mouth. Every new acceptance is a fresh slice of independence, and you‚Äôll wolf it all down.

Fortunately, my personal coming out story reeks of acceptance and Hallmark cards. I sat my parents down and told them everything in a diligently rehearsed 17-minute monologue. In 18 minutes, it was done. Questions were asked, hugs were exchanged, a tear was shed (that would be me). My mum went for a walk with her friends and my dad continued solving the crossword puzzle. They accepted it with a simple shrug (and lots of love and support over the next couple of years, but this is not that story). My sexuality was just another fact.

What about the war of words I had been expecting? The emotional bloodshed? The years of torment at the hands of society? They never came, even though history books said that they would. Times are changing, and somewhere over pop culture references and more inclusive media representations, my parents and peers had changed as well. The history books had it wrong.

What they did get right was this ‚Äî freedom felt liberating. The freedom to stay single. To be a sexual deviant. The freedom to wear a skirt (if you are a man) or a jersey (if you are a woman). The freedom to wear both, or neither. The freedom to never find your way back home.

What do we do with the freedom then? Do we let it consume us? Terrify us into never seeking it out? We do neither. We simply unwind and enjoy it with a cup of tea. Preferably, chamomile.

Indian women hockey team set to play Belgium junior men‚Äôs team,"Hockey women will play against Junior Belgium men team. (Source: Hockey India) Hockey women will play against Junior Belgium men team. (Source: Hockey India)

In a first of its kind, the Indian women hockey team will play two matches against Beligum‚Äôs junior men‚Äôs team when they tour Europe next month, in order to get them better prepared for Asia Cup, that is set to take place in Japan later this year.

This is not the first time that team coach Sjoerd Marijne has done something like this. When he was the coach of Dutch team, he had played his side against men as he said that it heps make the game quick. He said in an interview to ESPN, ‚ÄúPlaying against boys speeds up the game. You have to be faster, stronger and if you don‚Äôt do that, the boys will punish you immediately. If you want a sporting equivalent, this is a bit like a 100m sprinter but running extra downhill. They will put a lot of speed into the game. That speed must feel normal for us, which is not always possible when playing against girls. We have to defend really well.‚Äù

Beligum junior team is known to be a strong team, having finished runners-up behind India at the last World Cup in Lucknow in December 2016. ‚ÄúThe reason for selecting Belgium as an opponent is that they are a really structured team, which is always important,‚Äù Marijne said.

The decision to play women against men has garnered interest in the hockey fraternity. Former India goalkeeper AB Subbaiah said, ‚ÄúIn India, we often used to play against the women‚Äôs team in practice. We fielded institutional teams like Services, Air India, Indian Airlines or even the Sports Authority of India hostel sides against women‚Äôs senior or men‚Äôs junior team for meaningful practice. But I‚Äôm quite sure this is the first time the women‚Äôs team will be travelling abroad to face a junior men‚Äôs team, that too Belgium.‚Äù

Former Olympic medallist Vece Paess said, ‚ÄúA 16-year-old girl would be more mature, both emotionally as well as physically, than a boy of the same age. Playing sport with a boy would still help a girl develop well, as has been the case with badminton where top women players have often credited practising regularly alongside boys to their improved performances.‚Äù

‚ÄúA matchup between your senior women‚Äôs team and a junior men‚Äôs team is a good one,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt will be a learning experience, and I hope the team doesn‚Äôt get disheartened if they lose.‚Äù

Sean Dyche concerned about players safety after Blackburn fan invades pitch,"Sean Dyche expressed concern about the safety of his players. (Source: Reuters) Sean Dyche expressed concern about the safety of his players. (Source: Reuters)

Burnley manager Sean Dyche expressed concern about the safety of his players after a Blackburn Rovers fan ran on the field and physically confronted his team during Wednesday‚Äôs League Cup game at Ewood Park.

Burnley players were celebrating Jack Cork‚Äôs opening goal in their 2-0 win when a Blackburn fan entered the field and squared up to the players, pushing James Tarkowski in the chest and then grabbing midfielder Ashley Westwood by the neck.

The fan was eventually tussled to the ground by Burnley players before stewards removed him from the field of play. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what they are going to do on the pitch, people have to get that situation (under control) really, really quickly and it seemed a long time before anyone did anything,‚Äù said Dyche.

‚ÄúOur players eventually have to defend themselves and that can‚Äôt be right anywhere in football, that can‚Äôt be right,‚Äù added the Burnley boss who said that he and has staff were close to entering the field to help.

‚ÄúIt got to the point that we were going to go on because you can‚Äôt have that. Not to do anything ridiculous just to say ‚Äòwhoah this can‚Äôt happen‚Äô,‚Äù he said.

Blackburn are likely to face a fine for the incident but Dyche said he was concerned about the intent of the assailant. ‚ÄúI think we are all concerned. There used to be a time when if someone got on a football pitch it was kind of in jest, it was something silly and could almost be laughed at.

‚ÄúNow there are all kinds of different things going on in the world and when people get on a football pitch it has to be stopped very quickly.

‚ÄúThat is not just at this football club (Blackburn), I have to make that very clear, that is at any sporting situation. The challenge is for stewards, who I think do a terrific job all around the country ‚Äì they have got to get on quick, because the situation has changed,‚Äù he added.

There has been a history of violence between Blackburn and Burnley fans over many years and the streets around Ewood Park were heavily policed before the game.

Police made Burnley fans travel to the game on special buses laid on from their own Turf Moor ground, 15 miles from Rovers‚Äô stadium.

‚ÄúTo think you go to that extreme and then people just wander onto a football pitch is bizarre to say the least,‚Äù said Dyche.

Wayne Rooney announces retirement: Twitterati react to England‚Äôs highest goalscorer calling it a day,"Wayne Rooney announced retirement from England football team on Wednesday. (Source: Reuters) Wayne Rooney announced retirement from England football team on Wednesday. (Source: Reuters)

After Wayne Rooney announced his retirement from International football on Wednesday, the footballl world reacted to England‚Äôs all time highest goalscorer drawing curtain to his 14-year long career with the national team.

The 31-year old player, who also left Manchester United to play for Everton this season, said in a statement that he was called by coach Gareth Southgate to return back to the squad this week for the upcoming matches but he decided otherwise. ‚ÄúHaving already thought long and hard, I told Gareth that I had now decided to retire for good from international football. It is a really tough decision and one I have discussed with my family, my manager at Everton and those closest to me. Playing for England has always been special to me. Every time I was selected as a player or captain was a real privilege and I thank everyone who helped me. But I believe now is the time to bow out.‚Äù

Adding that he will always remain a passionate England fan, Rooney bid farewell to his stint with England after appearing in national colours 119 times and scoring 53 goals. The football world including Chris Smalling, Dean Ashton, Kevin Campbell reacted to the news and paid tribute to the ‚Äònational treasure‚Äô.

"Respect Pakistan‚Äôs security concerns, its role in Afghanistan: China tells US","US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson

The United States must value Pakistan‚Äôs role in Afghanistan and respect its security concerns, China‚Äôs top diplomat Yang Jiechi told US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call, according to Chinese state media.

China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry defended its ally Pakistan earlier this week after President Donald Trump said the United States could no longer be silent about militants using safe havens on Pakistani soil.

On Monday, Trump committed the United States to an open-ended conflict in Afghanistan, signalling he would send more troops to America‚Äôs longest war and vowing ‚Äúa fight to win‚Äù.

He insisted that others ‚Äì the Afghan government, Pakistan, India and NATO allies ‚Äì step up their own commitment to resolving the 16-year conflict, but he saved his sharpest words for Pakistan.

Yang, who outranks China‚Äôs foreign minister, told Tillerson on Wednesday that China was willing to coordinate with the United States on Afghanistan and make joint efforts to realise peace and stability there and in the region, according to a Chinese statement issued late that night.

‚ÄúWe must value Pakistan‚Äôs important role on the Afghanistan issue, and respect Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and reasonable security concerns,‚Äù Yang told Tillerson.

Pakistan has been battling home-grown Islamists for years. It sees Afghanistan as a vital strategic interest and a bulwark against old rival, India. Islamabad denies harbouring militants, who move across the porous border with Afghanistan.

China and Pakistan consider each other ‚Äúall-weather friends‚Äù and have close diplomatic, economic and security ties.

Beijing has its own security concerns in the region, in particular any links between militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan and Islamist groups China blames for violence in its far western region of Xinjiang.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Pakistani Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua in Beijing on Tuesday, according to a statement on Thursday. He praised Pakistan‚Äôs efforts to combat extremism and to secure the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a development initiative central to President Xi Jinping‚Äôs global Belt and Road development plan.

‚ÄúGiven the current complicated and changing international and regional situation, the strategic significance of China-Pakistan relations is even more prominent,‚Äù Wang said.

Sanjivani Jadhav: India‚Äôs silver lining in Taipei Games,"Sanjivani Jadhav won a silver in the women‚Äôs 10,000 metres at the World University Games in Taipei. Sanjivani Jadhav won a silver in the women‚Äôs 10,000 metres at the World University Games in Taipei.

Sanjivani Jadhav won a silver in the women‚Äôs 10,000 metres at the World University Games in Taipei. The 20-year-old ,is one of the rising stars of Indian athletics and she gave an indication of her talent when she won a bronze in the 5000 metres at the Asian Athletics Championships in Bhubaneswar in July. This is the second major medal for the youngster from Nashik, who was also a medalist at the World School Olympiad.

Daria Maslova of Kyrgyztan won the gold with a timing of 33:19.27 and Jadhav came second at 33:22.00. The strides Sanjivani has made in just over a month can be gauged from the fact that she had clocked 33.28.35 to finish fifth in Bhubaneswar but shaved off over five seconds at the 29th Summer Universiade. What made her second place impressive was that Maslova had the experience of competing at the World Athletics Championships earlier this month. Sanjivani also had to stave off the threat from the Japanese duo of Hosoda and Yuki Munehisa. The latter had the fastest personal best in the field (31:58.46), but finished fourth in 33:40.45.

When it mattered, Sanjivani didn‚Äôt fade away as she was able to maintain her momentum when she and Maslova broke away from the field with 600 metres left. The bronze medal at the Asian meet was her first at a senior international meet. Shortly after winning the 5,000 metres bronze at the Asian Championships, Sanjivani, who hadn‚Äôt qualified for the World Championships, had said that her target was to finish on the podium at the Summer Universiade.

However, for all her promise on the athletics track, she began as a wrestler. It was coach Vijender Singh who spotted her during a local meet and convinced her that her future was in middle and long-distance running. A young Sanjivani was coaxed by her grandfather, who was a wrestler, to grapple. But guided by Vijender, Sanjivani was soon winning medals at the district level and never looked back.

The coach says he went by a hunch because Sanjivani hailed from a belt which also produced middle and long distance runners like Kavita Raut, an Asian Games and Commonwealth Games medalist. ‚ÄúShe is still just 20 and has already proved that she has the ability to win medals at international events. She has been consistently improving and is one for the future,‚Äù Vijender said.

US admiral says diplomacy key to resolving North Korea crisis,"In this photo distributed by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, second from right, inspects the preparation of the launch of a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile. (Source: AP) In this photo distributed by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, second from right, inspects the preparation of the launch of a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile. (Source: AP)

The head of the U.S. military‚Äôs Pacific Command said on Tuesday it was more important to use diplomacy to counter North Korea‚Äôs missile threat rather than consider what actions by the reclusive North might trigger a preemptive strike. Admiral Harry Harris was in South Korea to observe annual joint military drills with the South Korean military, which the North called a step towards nuclear conflict masterminded by the U.S. and South Korean ‚Äúwar maniacs‚Äù. ‚ÄúSo we hope and we work for diplomatic solutions to the challenge presented by Kim Jong Un,‚Äù Harris told reporters at a U.S. air base in South Korea about an hour from the capital, Seoul, referring to the North Korean leader.

He said diplomacy was ‚Äúthe most important starting point‚Äù in response to the North‚Äôs threat, when asked what actions by North Korea might trigger a preemptive U.S. strike against Pyongyang. ‚ÄúAs far as a timeline, it would be crazy for me to share with you those tripwires in advance. If we did that, it would hardly be a military strategy,‚Äù he added. North Korea has pursued missile and nuclear tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and ignored all calls, including from lone major ally China, to stop. It justifies its weapons programmes by pointing to perceived U.S. hostility and regularly threatens to destroy the United States.

The United States and South Korean began long-planned joint military exercises on Monday called the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which the allies have said were purely defensive and did not aim to increase tension on the Korean peninsula. The drills end on Aug. 31 and involve tens of thousands of troops as well as computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea..

A North Korean Army spokesman repeated the threat of undisclosed retaliation against the United States for readying a preemptive strike and a war of aggression, using the drills as an excuse to mount such an attack. ‚ÄúThe U.S. will be wholly held accountable for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by such reckless aggressive war manoeuvres, as it chose a military confrontation,‚Äù the unnamed spokesman said in comments carried by the North‚Äôs official KCNA news agency. Harris also told reporters that a scheduled ‚Äúoperational pause‚Äù by the U.S. Navy‚Äôs fleet worldwide would not affect the military‚Äôs ability to defend South Korea.

The pause was ordered after a U.S. guided missile destroyer collided with an oil tanker in waters near Singapore and Malaysia on Monday.

India vs Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka wobble to 236/8 against India,"India restrict Sri Lanka to 236 for 8. (Source: PTI) India restrict Sri Lanka to 236 for 8. (Source: PTI)

The good start given by the openers was just what Sri Lanka needed. Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka took the score to 35 for no loss from the first six over. There were some gorgeous looking shots from the former, pulling the short ball, making room for himself to play through point. But, his wicket in the eighth over slowed down Sri Lanka.

A good platform was laid for the middle-order to build on but Sri Lanka managed to do what they have done all through this series ‚Äî collapse. They are 70 for 1 and collapsed to 125 for 5 before a sensible half-century from Milinda Siriwardana helped them closer to 200. But all Sri Lanka could managed was 236 for 8 in 50 overs.

A better experienced team would have made the start look too good and even would have done well to come out of the collapse and scored closer to 300. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, never could figure out.

Gunathilaka, unlike his partner, was slow to begin and never took the risk against the pacers. So when he did take it against spinner Yuzvender Chahal, he missed delivery and was stump. The leg-spinner moved the ball nicely away from the left-hander before MS Dhoni removed the bails after a fumble.

Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews were removed in quick succession leg-before wicket and in similar fashion. Both tried sweeping full deliveries but missed. Sri Lanka needed some runs in the middle overs but those wickets combined with some tight bowling from the spin duo of Chahal and Axar Patel bowled a tight line which did not allow the batsmen to run away with the game.

The last ten overs fetched only 57 runs despite having five wickets in hand. Axar and Chahal combined for 20 overs but gave only 73 picking up three wickets. Kedar Jadhav had to pitch in for Hardik Pandya who went off the field due to a knee problem. Bumrah, though, was brilliant at the death and finished with four wickets from 10 overs.

"Amid outrage, Philippine opposition presses President Rodrigo Duterte to stop killings","Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. (File Photo) Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. (File Photo)

Political opponents of Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday urged him to end a culture of impunity and quell a surge in drug-related killings, amid widespread anger at police over the death of a teenager. Allegations of police abuse and a cover-up in last week‚Äôs death of Kian Loyd delos Santos has caused rare outrage among a public largely supportive of Duterte‚Äôs campaign, which saw more than 90 people killed last week in three nights of intensified police operations. The grade 11 student was shot dead on Wednesday last week in a rundown area of Manila. According to a forensic expert who conducted an autopsy, Delos Santos was shot in the back of the head and ears while on the floor, suggesting there was no gunfight, contrary to an official police report. The victim‚Äôs family reject police allegations he was a drug courier.

Duterte has resolutely defended police on the front lines of his 14-month-old war on drugs, but late on Monday he said three officers involved in the teenager‚Äôs killing should be punished if found to have broken the law.

Duterte said he had seen the CCTV footage acquired by media which showed plain clothes police dragging a man matching the description of Delos Santos, to a location where he was later found dead. Opposition Senator Leila de Lima, a detained critic of Duterte, challenged the president to order the police to stop killing.

‚ÄúI dare you, Mr President, to issue a clear and categorical order to the entire police force to stop the killings now,‚Äù de Lima said in a handwritten note from a detention facility, where she is being held on charges of involvement in drugs trade inside jails. She denies the charges. ‚ÄúJust say it. Do it now, please.‚Äù

‚ÄòSTIRRED INTO ACTION‚Äô

Another senator, Risa Hontiveros, told the house Duterte had blood on his hands and ‚Äúreveled in the deaths of drug addicts‚Äù, inspiring a culture of impunity and killing. Filipinos tired of crime and drugs and supportive of the president had woken up to what was happening, she said. ‚ÄúYou had no choice but to confront his death because his narrative was compelling,‚Äù she said of Delos Santos. ‚ÄúYou felt stirred into action because you could no longer ignore the growing outrage ‚Ä¶ But Kian was not the first. That there were thousands of deaths before him and that you allowed it to happen.‚Äù

Social media users, politicians of all sides and Catholic bishops have called for an impartial investigation into the surge in killings by police, which stopped suddenly when news of the teenager‚Äôs death surfaced. The Senate will hold an inquiry into last week‚Äôs bloodshed on Thursday. Since Duterte took office, more than 3,500 people have been killed in what the Philippine National Police (PNP) says were gunfights with drug suspects who had resisted arrests. Police say some 2,000 more people were killed in other, drug-related violence that it denies involvement in. Human rights advocates, however, say the death toll in the war on drugs could be far higher than police have reported.

Senator Paulo Benigno Aquino said that without the CCTV footage, the case of Delos Santos would have gained no attention. He said Duterte should stop the killings and strengthen the judiciary, education, law enforcement and rehabilitation.

‚ÄúThere must be other ways, Mr President. There has to be other solutions to our drug menace,‚Äù he said. Separately, Duterte‚Äôs office and the military moved to quell speculation of discontent among the security forces about their involvement in the anti-drugs campaign. A shadowy group of soldiers and police on Monday issued a statement calling for Duterte‚Äôs removal for turning the security forces into his ‚Äúprivate army‚Äù and ordering them to carry out extrajudicial killings. The group did not identify its members.

The upcoming Ashes series between England and Australia is expected to be a feisty contest. With both teams in good form, players from the warring sides will know the importance of getting a strong start to the series. While preparations for one of the anticipated series have already begun, in the latest interview pacer, Mitchell Starc has revealed his plans to take down the English batsman, which is by targeting the inexperienced lot. Noticeably, England‚Äôs batting-order does comprise the likes of David Malan, Mark Stoneman and Westley, all of whom are relatively new to the international stage.

Speaking to The Unplayable Podcast, Starc said, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre certainly not as settled in the batting stakes as they were a little while ago. Root and Cook are their two guys that are quite experienced and their two key batters.‚Äù and added, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying a few guys there at the top with the last couple of series so you don‚Äôt really quite know who they‚Äôre going to bring to Australia yet. It will be interesting, it‚Äôs a nice one to watch for the bowlers. We‚Äôre a more settled side than they are at the moment. Their batting line-up is one we can look at try to exploit in our conditions.‚Äù

Commenting on the English bowling attack, Starc said,‚Äù(England) will rely a lot on their bowlers who come to Australia and have played a lot in Australia before,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the most dangerous part about their team with guys who have taken a lot of wickets, home and away as well.

"Conor McGregor has boxing skill, but enough to beat Floyd Mayweather?","Conor McGregor claims he has worked on defense during his training camp. (Source: Reuters) Conor McGregor claims he has worked on defense during his training camp. (Source: Reuters)

Before Conor McGregor had even heard of mixed martial arts, he wanted to be a boxer. He first stepped into Crumlin Boxing Club nearly 20 years ago in muddy football boots and started punching a heavy bag.

McGregor returned constantly for the next seven years, determined to become tough enough to dissuade bullies in his Dublin neighborhood. He competed in amateur boxing matches against opponents of all sizes and shapes over the years, developing tenacity and power.

‚ÄúThere were no weight rules, no limitations on who you could fight,‚Äù McGregor recalled Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe would just have an opponent assigned to us. That was always the joke: Everybody at the Crumlin Boxing Club had to fight heavyweights, no matter what size you are. But it was a good lesson. You must be prepared for any eventuality. You must be ready to fight. That‚Äôs how I was brought into this game.‚Äù

McGregor is on top of the fight game this week before his Saturday showdown with Floyd Mayweather (49-0), the most accomplished boxer of his generation. McGregor, a former plumber who has never had a professional boxing match, will make roughly $100 million for stepping into the ring for the first time in the spectacle of the summer.

And though McGregor moved into MMA training in his teens and eventually rose to win two UFC belts, he is no boxing neophyte. While he has other strengths, McGregor‚Äôs MMA career has been built in large part on his boxing-bred punching power, which is considered exceptional by his sport‚Äôs standards.

Oh, and he also doesn‚Äôt lack confidence, which is no small thing when facing odds as daunting as McGregor‚Äôs chances against Mayweather.

‚ÄúNo fighter can train for what I bring into the ring or into the octagon,‚Äù McGregor said. ‚ÄúI am too skilled. I am too diverse. My movement is too much for them. All of these men will fall.‚Äù

But for McGregor to make Mayweather fall, he‚Äôll either need to land an astonishing home-run punch, or he‚Äôll have to show more creativity and sustained boxing skill than MMA usually demands.

While McGregor‚Äôs versatility and smarts have made him the UFC‚Äôs biggest star, he can use only one discipline against Mayweather and no serious people outside McGregor‚Äôs camp doubt Mayweather has more boxing skill. Still, McGregor has devoted himself to boxing in recent weeks, bringing in former champ Paulie Malignaggi among his many sparring partners and recruiting Joe Cortez, the veteran boxing referee, to instruct him on the finer points of etiquette.

‚ÄúFighting in Vegas, I just don‚Äôt see how Conor outpoints him (for a decision),‚Äù UFC President Dana White said. ‚ÄúConor is going to get in there to rough him up and try to knock him out.‚Äù

White and McGregor‚Äôs other fervent backers believe in his one-punch knockout power, which he showed most memorably in dethroning longtime UFC champion Jose Aldo. But one-punch knockouts are rare in 8-ounce boxing gloves, which diffuse the impact of a blow more than tiny UFC gloves.

McGregor‚Äôs ability to pull off perhaps the most improbable upset in sports history likely rests on his chances to land not just one punch, but repeated combinations of blows on Mayweather, who has shown a decent chin on the few occasions he has been hit in the past decade.

If McGregor can‚Äôt consistently hit Mayweather and nobody has consistently connected against Money May in over a decade he can at least avoid embarrassment by not getting knocked out and there is no doubt McGregor can take a punch. His sparring partners have spoken of his tough chin, and it was evident last year in his two UFC brawls with Nate Diaz. Their second bout in August 2016 devolved into a brutal standup fight that left both men bloodied and bruised.

McGregor‚Äôs disregard for defense in that bout or his inability to defend himself from repeated head blows could be decisive when facing Mayweather, who might be the most precise puncher in the sport. McGregor claims he has worked on defense during his training camp, but his predictions for the fight invariably return to his belief in his own power.

No matter what happens to McGregor at T-Mobile Arena, he will rely on the skills he first learned at the Crumlin Boxing Club, where his mother Mags still works out. The club will be full of his fans when it screens the fight at about 5 a.m. Sunday morning.

‚ÄúYou will see the culmination of everything I‚Äôve learned and studied,‚Äù McGregor said. ‚ÄúA great many people helped to get me to what you will see this weekend.‚Äù

India eyes remote air traffic control towers for regional airports,"Remote monitoring allows traditional concrete control towers to be replaced with dozens of high resolution, infra-red cameras around runways that feed live images to screens in buildings far from the airport. (Image Credit: AAI) Remote monitoring allows traditional concrete control towers to be replaced with dozens of high resolution, infra-red cameras around runways that feed live images to screens in buildings far from the airport.

India is considering setting up remote air traffic control (ATC) towers to cut costs and overcome labour shortages, government sources told Reuters, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks to open dozens of regional airports to boost air travel. Remote monitoring allows traditional concrete control towers to be replaced with dozens of high resolution, infra-red cameras around runways that feed live images to screens in buildings far from the airport.

The technology, used in countries including Australia, Canada, Ireland and Sweden, enables flights at multiple airports to be monitored from one location, reducing the need for air traffic controllers and physical towers at every airport. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has initiated a study on remote monitoring of flights, with a recommendation expected in September, one of the sources said. A decision to proceed could be a boost to companies like Sweden‚Äôs Saab and Canada-based Searidge Technologies that are in talks with the airport regulator to bring the technology to India.

‚ÄúIndia is one of the biggest opportunities in terms of the business potential,‚Äù said Varun Singh, marketing director at Saab India, adding that it has held several discussions with the airport regulator. Searidge, which has set up remote digital towers in Hungary, Albania and Azerbaijan, said it has also presented its technology to the airport regulator.

Air passenger traffic in India, the world‚Äôs fourth biggest market, is growing at over 20 percent annually. Plans are underway to revive 50 regional airports in the next two years under a new scheme to boost connectivity between small cities. Low-cost carriers IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe, and SpiceJet have ordered dozens of new, small planes from European turboprop maker ATR and Canada‚Äôs Bombardier to fly regional routes.

The AAI is working with India‚Äôs aviation safety watchdog, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), on the study and has sought information from countries where remote towers are in use, one source said. The plan hinges on DGCA‚Äôs approval because remote tower technology is not standardised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is still drawing up regulations. In the meantime, countries follow their own safety guidelines.

While there have been power failures at ATC towers at two of India‚Äôs biggest and busiest airports ‚Äì Delhi and Mumbai ‚Äì in the past, no incidents or accidents occurred as a result, according to local media reports. (Image Credit: Reuters) While there have been power failures at ATC towers at two of India‚Äôs biggest and busiest airports ‚Äì Delhi and Mumbai ‚Äì in the past, no incidents or accidents occurred as a result, according to local media reports. (Image Credit: Reuters)

‚ÄúRemote ATC is all the more needed for India given our vast area, low traffic at regional airports and the need to keep airfares low,‚Äù said Amber Dubey, India head of aerospace and defence at consultancy KPMG. However, in several parts of India availability of reliable power and telecom connectivity are a challenge, said Dubey. While there have been power failures at ATC towers at two of India‚Äôs biggest and busiest airports ‚Äì Delhi and Mumbai ‚Äì in the past, no incidents or accidents occurred as a result, according to local media reports.

The bigger concern, however, is the transfer of data from the airport to the remote tower. An ATC official at India‚Äôs airport regulator said they are yet to understand how the data transfer will work, what medium will be used and what the backup will be. ‚ÄúIf the (data transfer) medium goes blank, the airport will be cut off,‚Äù said the official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Controllers would also need to be trained to recognise and adapt to local conditions, including weather and topography, of multiple airports instead of just one, the source added.

The economics are appealing, however. The cost of servicing a regional airport with remote monitoring could be between 15-50 percent of building individual concrete towers, depending on how many airports are monitored, according to estimates by Saab. Savings also come from not having to station air traffic controllers, who are in short supply, in remote parts of the country for only a couple of flights a day. India has over 3,100 controllers but needs close to 3,900, and with more airports planned, demand is set to rise.

‚ÄúWith low traffic levels, controllers can monitor flights from multiple airports,‚Äù said Neil Bowles, head of Air Traffic Management at Searidge.

Saab, which has been operating remote towers in Sweden for two years and is in talks with about 10 other countries, said to ensure uninterrupted electricity it would equip the remote tower with backup supply similar to how it is done at airports. ‚ÄúWhatever you do for normal towers, you will do for this,‚Äù said Saab‚Äôs Singh.

Why Scams are Here to Say: Understanding Political Corruption in India

Author: N Ram

Publisher: Aleph Book Company

202 pages

Following demonetisation 2016, there has been heightened public interest in the black economy and corruption in India. The public thinks of scams as the big cases of corruption involving the high and mighty political and business leaders. The book under review largely analyses this linkage in both theoretical terms and with reference to some specific cases. The definitional aspects, links with media and the executive are explored.

The book comprises three sections divided into eight chapters. There is an introduction and a long conclusion where the author discusses what can be done. Section I, consisting of three chapters, presents the ‚Äústory of corruption in India‚Äù. Section II provides the context by focussing on ‚Äúhistorical, conceptual and theoretical issues‚Äù. Chapter 6 presents the author‚Äôs understanding, based on the Marxist view of political corruption, which is seen as an alternative to mainstream approaches. He critiques the ‚Äúoverly simplified moral‚Äù view underlying the ‚Äúfailed‚Äù JP and Anna Hazare movements.

Section III presents two important case studies which the author had directly dealt with, which give insights into the links between scams and politics in India. These two scams are Bofors and J Jayalaithaa‚Äôs disproportionate assets case. He hypothesises that ‚Äúseveral Indian states have their own corruption systems‚Äù. So, there is a need for focussed empirical research to help find ways to combat corruption. The author states that the problem has become intractable without a change in India‚Äôs political economy. In the conclusion, he nonetheless presents suggestions under nine broad headings ‚Äî ‚Äúlaws, enforcement capacity, policies, institutions, regulation, vigilance, corporate sector, journalism and politics‚Äù.

The author describes the ‚Äúgrand corruption that operates year-round with clockwork, ‚Äúscientific precision.‚Äù However, this is true of most black income generation (and not just big corruption) and that is why in the literature it has been called ‚Äúsystemic and systematic‚Äù. The book points out that it is the joint product of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen. In the literature, it has been called the ‚Äútriad‚Äù and dismantling it is crucial to tackling black economy and corruption. This requires accountability, especially of the political class. While RTI can help in this, it is the public that has to act by not electing the corrupt. But, the public often has little choice since political parties put up the corrupt and the criminal in the belief that they can deliver.

In Chapter 3 and the conclusion, flawed laws and their weak enforcement are discussed. The author veers to the view that the government is overburdened compared to other countries. But, laws are laws in letter and spirit. If the spirit is weak, then howsoever good a law maybe, it can be circumvented by clever people to their advantage. That has been India‚Äôs experience, whether we think of the anti-defection laws, election financing law or the Income Tax Act.

The book misses the impact of corruption/scams on society ‚Äî it leads to policy failure and to inefficiencies, which lower the rate of growth of the economy below its potential. In addition, it results in ‚Äúsocial waste‚Äù so that welfare associated with growth diminishes. Consequently, even when incomes rise, poverty does not decline and inequality rises.

The book presents the historical context of corruption in India and mentions the idea of ‚ÄúAsiatic Corruption‚Äù. The author points out that the real scandal of the Empire was the loot of India and that was the bigger corruption. The idea that India was a corrupt country before British rule needs to be revisited. Corruption needs to be defined in relation to the laws of the land. If paying money to state officials for work to be done is customary or when the empire of a vanquished king is usurped by the victor, can it be called corruption? There is a fine line between legality and illegality, and this line shifts with changes in laws and the social understanding prevailing at that point of time.

In India, if the black economy is taken as a measure of the level of corruption, the size has grown from 4-5 per cent in 1955-56 to the present 62 per cent of GDP. If one extrapolates back, the level of corruption during colonial rule was low largely because most people had little to do with the state, which was small in size. Since the 1950s, the number of major scams in the country has been exploding in both number and the amount of money involved (See my Indian Economy since Independence: Persisting Colonial Disruption).

The book highlights the role of the private sector, especially MNCs (in spite of rules in advanced countries). In conclusion, the author says that ‚Äúit would be irresponsible for citizens to stand aside‚Äù. The implication is clear: movements are crucial to the battle against corruption.

Delhi Police shares throwback picture of its FIRST FIR and fills Twitterati with glee,"Such an insightful throwback tweet! (Source: Delhi Police/Twitter) Such an insightful throwback tweet! (Source: Delhi Police/Twitter)

Have you ever wondered who committed the first crime on the planet? If not on the planet, you may now know about the first breach of law in the capital, thanks to Delhi Police‚Äôs #ThrowbackThursday photo on Twitter. Reminiscing about the episode that took place in the 19th century, they shared a photo of the page where the details of the crime were jotted down. Written in Urdu, it spells out that a theft of hookah (smoking pipe), utensils, a few attires and, even a kulfi took place on October 18, 1861. The document was later framed and showcased at the Delhi Police Museum. Not just that, a photo of the earliest FIR also graces the wall of Subzi Mandi Police Station, where it was filed 156 years ago.

Posting the picture on the social media networking site, they wrote: ‚Äú#ThrowbackThursday with some of the rare moments in the history of DelhiPolice.‚Äù Check it out here.

Interestingly, the complaint was lodged by Maeeuddin Wald Mohammad, a resident of Katra Sheesh Mahal. It may come across as a really small amount, but the stolen commodities costed just 45 aanas, which totals up to around Rs 3 in today‚Äôs times. The Delhi Police also added prestige to their tweet with their 10-year-old hashtag ‚ÄòKhaas Hai Itihaas‚Äô which means ‚Äúhistory is special‚Äù.

People expressed their delight and surprise after looking at the tweet. Check out some reactions here.

"Suresh Prabhu offers to quit as Railway Minister, Air India chief Ashwani Lohani to head Railway Board","Rail Minister Suresh Prabhu offered to resign on Wednesday. (Source: Express photo by Renuka Puri) Rail Minister Suresh Prabhu offered to resign on Wednesday. (Source: Express photo by Renuka Puri)

Taking ‚Äúfull moral responsibility‚Äù for the spate of train accidents under his watch, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu met Prime Minister Narendra Modi Wednesday morning and offered to resign. He said he was asked by the Prime Minister to ‚Äúwait‚Äù. But signalling the government‚Äôs intent for change in the leadership of the national transporter, Railway Board chairman A K Mittal was replaced Wednesday by Air India chief Ashwani Lohani. Sources said Mittal, whose term was to end July next year, had asked to be relieved of office Tuesday. Lohani will remain on the post until December 2018.

The developments came on the day when another train accident took place in Uttar Pradesh in the early hours. A dumper truck strayed into the path of the Delhi-bound Kaifiyat Express in Auraiya district, causing nine coaches to derail. At least 81 people were injured.

Suresh Prabhu, sources said, called up the Prime Minister around 7 am and offered to step down. Modi asked him to come for the Cabinet meeting scheduled for 10.30 am. While the Cabinet was briefed about the accident, Suresh Prabhu met Modi after the meeting and expressed his willingness to put in his papers.

‚ÄúI met the Hon‚Äôble Prime Minister @narendramodi taking full moral responsibility. Hon‚Äôble PM has asked me to wait,‚Äù Suresh Prabhu tweeted at 2.40 pm. By then, the process to replace Mittal was already underway. Responding to queries from reporters after the Cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said: ‚ÄúAccountability is a good system in government. PM will take a call on whatever request Suresh Prabhu has made to him.‚Äù

Whether the Prime Minister will stop at Lohani‚Äôs appointment or accept Suresh Prabhu‚Äôs resignation to bring in a new face will be clear if and when a Cabinet reshuffle does take place, sources said. Within an hour of Suresh Prabhu‚Äôs tweet, the BJP‚Äôs official IT cell started posting a series of tweets on ‚ÄúMyths vs Reality‚Äù to show that the railway safety performance under the NDA tenure was not worse off. In some areas of safety, the tweets said, the performance was better than before.

From the 1980 batch of the Indian Railway Service of Mechanical Engineers, Lohani‚Äôs appointment also signals that the government no longer believes that the present board can bring about the perceptible change in railways that it desires, top sources told The Indian Express.

The only Railway Board chairman not to have served as a zonal railway general manager, Lohani is called ‚Äúturnaround man‚Äù in bureaucratic circles owing to his performance in India Tourism Development Corporation and Madhya Pradesh Tourism. While in Air India, Lohani advocated empowering and motivating existing employees to turn around the carrier.

"In economic crisis, Angola votes for first new leader in 38 years","Questions have been raised as to how much power Lourenco will have if he wins, given veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 74, will continue as head of the MPLA and have potentially a sweeping say over decision-making. Questions have been raised as to how much power Lourenco will have if he wins, given veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 74, will continue as head of the MPLA and have potentially a sweeping say over decision-making.

Angolans headed to the polls on Wednesday in a parliamentary election expected to usher in the ruling party‚Äôs defence minister as the first new leader of Africa‚Äôs second biggest oil producer for 38 years.

Joao Lourenco, who has pledged to boost growth and fight corruption, would inherit an economy mired in recession as gaping inequality, soaring inflation and high unemployment squeeze poor Angolans who have benefited little from a decades-long oil boom.

The People‚Äôs Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) is expected to remain in power but with a reduced majority. Its support has waned due to widespread political cronyism, though many Angolans remain loyal to the party that ended 27 years of civil war in 2002.

Voters were seen waiting in orderly queues on a cloudy morning in the capital Luanda when polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) as police and military manned street corners.

Questions have been raised as to how much power Lourenco will have if he wins, given veteran leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 74, will continue as head of the MPLA and have potentially a sweeping say over decision-making.

His daughter, Isabel, heads national oil producer Sonangol and his son Jos√© Filomeno is in charge of the state investment fund. Lourenco on Tuesday dismissed suggestions he would be a puppet president, saying he would focus on leading an ‚Äúeconomic miracle‚Äù, possibly with the help of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and prosecute corrupt politicians.

Dos Santos, Africa‚Äôs longest-ruling president behind Equatorial Guinea‚Äôs Teodoro Obiang Nguema, will step down after guiding the OPEC-member from Marxism to capitalism while embracing Chinese oil-for-infrastructure investment.

The MPLA‚Äôs main opponent will be its former civil war foe, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), while young voters have been lured by CASA-CE, which was formed in 2012 on a promise to disrupt 50 years of two-party politics.

There are concerns about how fair the vote will be after the government cracked down on recently planned public demonstrations. UNITA has said it will lead protests if it believes the MPLA has manipulated results.

An unofficial result is expected by Friday.

But there may be no formal announcement for two weeks as ballot boxes wend their way along pot-holed roads and dirt tracks in a country of 28 million spread across an area twice the size of France.

"Kareena, Karisma steal our hearts with their ageless beauty but Taimur Ali Khan takes away all the attention","We can't help but feel envious of the genetically blessed Kapoor sisters - Kareena and Karisma. While Kareena is the personification of beauty and attitude, it would be safe to say that Karisma has stopped aging. While the sisters continue to rule our hearts, it is Taimur Ali Khan who has never failed to take away all the attention and love from his Maasi and mother.

Kareena and Karisma were recently spotted shooting for an advertisement together. This is for the first time that they would appear on screen together. Karisma shared some behind the scene moments with her fans. And out of all, it is Taimur's presence that just took the photo to another level. Taimur was accompanied by Karisma's children, daughter Samiera Kapoor and son Kiaan Raj Kapoor.

The sisters bonded post the shoot as well. We can say that Kareena and Karisma are true examples of how sisters can be each other's best friend.

Fondly known as Bebo and Lolo, the two have been fashionistas, fitness icons and Bollywood queens too.

While Karisma has chosen to stay away from the screens, Kareena is prepping up for Veerey Di Wedding."
Privacy as fundamental right to boost digital adoption: Nasscom,"The Supreme Court‚Äôs declaring privacy as a fundamental right will enhance citizens‚Äô trust in digital services and help in their wider adoption, IT industry body Nasscom said today. In a landmark decision, a nine-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar has ruled that ‚Äúright to privacy is an intrinsic part of Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21 and entire Part III of the Constitution‚Äù.

Nasscom President R Chandrashekhar said the ruling also ‚Äúsignificantly boosts India‚Äôs attractiveness as a safe destination for global sourcing‚Äù. It will ensure that protection of citizen‚Äôs privacy is a ‚Äúcardinal principle‚Äù in India‚Äôs growing digital economy, he said.

Citizen‚Äôs trust in digital services is a prerequisite for widespread digital adoption, he noted. With falling data and smartphone costs, adoption of digital services has seen a manifold growth in the country. However, concerns around security of the user data has also emerged as a matter of debate, particularly with reference to Aadhaar.

Rama Vedashree, CEO of Data Security Council of India (DSCI) ‚Äî a part of Nasscom ‚Äî said the body has always advocated for a stronger data security regime in the country. ‚Äú‚Ä¶this judgement will further reinforce industry efforts and resolve to provide necessary assurance in this regard,‚Äù Vedashree said.

Nasscom and DSCI have asserted that they will continue to work with the government in accelerating the enforcement framework.

Legendary cricketer and Rajya Sabha member Sachin Tendulkar has disbursed Rs 15 lakh from his allocated Members of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) fund for a ‚ÄòWater Supply Project‚Äô at the Police Training Centre in Sangli district of Maharashtra.

The news was confirmed by Sanjay Barkund, who is the head of Turchi Police Training Center.

‚ÄúWe had written to many celebrities to grant funds for this Water Supply project. However we did not get a favourable response from them. Mr. Tendulkar heard our plea and immediately recommended the project worth 15 Lakhs through his MPLAD Funds. We at the Turchi Police Training Centre are extremely grateful to Mr. Tendulkar,‚Äù Barkund told PTI.

Under the scheme, each MP has the choice to suggest to the District Collector for works to the tune of Rs. 5 Crores per annum to be taken up in his/her constituency.

Under the MPLAD scheme, the Rajya Sabha MPs can recommend works in one or more districts in the State from where he/she has been elected.

"India vs Sri Lanka, 2nd ODI Preview: India look to continue winning streak against hapless Sri Lanka","India will hope to continue its domination over the Lankan side. (Source: PTI) India will hope to continue its domination over the Lankan side. (Source: PTI)

After registering a thumping 9-wicket win in the first one-day international, team India will once again lock its horns against Sri Lanka at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Pallekele. While India will be buoyed by their string of spectacular performances, Sri Lanka needs to pull up their socks as they still have a lot to play for.

As far as the Indian team is concerned the form of Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli augurs well for the team. However, opener Rohit Sharma will be looking to add a few runs to his belt. The series will also be important for MS Dhoni as he has to justify his selection. While any major changes are not expected in the side, young Kuldeep Yadav might get a look in if Axar Patel is rested. But as of now, it seems like skipper Kohli will look to continue with Yuzvendra Chahal and Axar Patel as his spin options.

Meanwhile, the hosts are plagued with a variety of concerns. Their disappointing performance in the first ODI led to sloganeering by fans. The selection of the team also raised quite a few eyebrows. The Lankan side also needs the veterans to rise to the occasion and deliver a match winning performance. The likes of Lasith Malinga, Thisara Perera, Angelo Mathews and Upul Tharanga were mediocre in the first ODI and hence the onus will be on them to perform.

As the first ODI turned out to be a pretty much one-sided affair, fans will be hoping that this one will see the hosts put up a fight. But as of now, India seems like firm favorites and hence India will look to continue with their winning momentum.

Teams:

India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli(c), Lokesh Rahul, MS Dhoni(w), Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal, Manish Pandey, Ajinkya Rahane, Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav

The nights after Summerslam always prove to be exciting and Smackdown Live lived up to its expectations. After AJ Styles retained the United States Title both Owens and Styles were right back in each other‚Äôs face. Owens reiterated his thoughts that he was denied a win due to unfair advantage. Demanding a rematch, KO also demanded that he choose the referee.

However, the surprise of the evening came when Smackdown became glorious with the arrival of former NXT Champion Bobby Roode. On his debut, Roode put an impressive performance as he defeated Aiden English. However, the string of surprises did not end there as SmackDown LIVE General Manager Daniel Bryan revealed another new addition to Smackdown- Shelton Benjamin.

After the loss at Summerslam, Japanese rock star Shinsuke Nakamura had his share of revenge when he took on The Singh Brothers in a 1-on-2 Handicap Match.

In the main event of the night, Kevin Owens took on Aj Styles but chose Baron Corbin as the special guest referee. Corbin agreed to the officiating role on the condition that KO gives him an opportunity to challenge him for the United States Title if he wins back the championship, to which Owens agreed.

While Corbin remained fair through the match, towards the end a shove by AJ Styles changed his stand. As he attempted to take down Styles, Shane McMahon interfered and ensured it doesn‚Äôt happen. A frustrated Corbin left the ring and Shane-O-Mac donned the role of a referee. This left Kevin Owens a bit distracted and allowed Styles to hit the phenomenal fore-arm.

Former Libyan premier Ali Zeidan freed after nine-day kidnapping,"Ali Zeidan (File Photo) Ali Zeidan (File Photo)

An armed group has released former Libyan premier Ali Zeidan, nine days after he was kidnapped in Tripoli while making his first visit home for three years, a family member and friend said today. Zeidan, 67, who served as premier from November 2012 to March 2014, was snatched on August 13 from his hotel.

He was on his first visit to Tripoli since leaving the country following his ouster by parliament on charges of embezzling public funds. ‚ÄúMr Zeidan was released on Tuesday night. He is in very good health and should be leaving Libya‚Äù on Wednesday, said Karam Khaled, a close friend.

He declined to give details on the release but has blamed a militia loyal to Libya‚Äôs UN-backed Government for National Accord (GNA) for the kidnapping. Zeidan Zeidan, a son of the former premier, said they had spoken several times on the telephone since his release.

‚ÄúFor the time being, we have no details on the circumstances of his detention,‚Äù he told AFP. ‚ÄúBut the most important thing is that he‚Äôs very well and was not mistreated.‚Äù Zeidan returned to Libya in early August for the first time since his dismissal and was planning a Tripoli press conference to respond to the embezzlement charges, according to Khaled, who accompanied him.

He said the former prime minister‚Äôs visit had been coordinated with Fayez al-Sarraj, the current premier in the GNA. ‚ÄúIt was the GNA that prepared the visit, including protocol at the airport and the hotel reservation,‚Äù Khaled said, adding that an armed group‚Äôs initial attempt to seize Zeidan on August 12 had been foiled by hotel guards.

In October 2013, gunmen seized then premier Zeidan from another hotel in the capital but he was released after several hours. Since a 2011 revolution that ousted longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have had to depend on rival militias battling for control of the country.

Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina blasts Chief Justice amid growing row,"Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina

Amid a raging row with the Supreme Court, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today slammed Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha for comparing Bangladesh with Pakistan and accused him of ‚Äúhumiliating‚Äù the country. Sinha, the first Hindu apex court chief justice in this Muslim-majority country, yesterday said that the judiciary has been very patient and referred to the removal of Pakistan‚Äôs Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by the country‚Äôs apex court.

‚ÄúWe are being very, very patient. The Supreme Court of Pakistan removed the prime minister. Was there any criticism over it? No,‚Äù Sinha told an open court hearing. Commenting on Sinha‚Äôs remarks, Hasina said this cannot be accepted that a Pakistan court removed their premier through a verdict and that will be used as a threat in Bangladesh. ‚ÄúHe should have quit‚Ä¶The most humiliating thing is the comparison with Pakistan which is intolerable,‚Äù Hasina said, without mentioning Chief Justice Sinha‚Äôs name.

‚ÄúThere would be no benefit in giving me such a threat (of removal),‚Äù she said, asserting that she is not scared at all. ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs court is the biggest court; no one can ignore people‚Äôs court‚Ä¶I‚Äôm lodging my complaint with this court‚Ä¶ I want justice from the court of people,‚Äù she said.

A number of senior government leaders virtually attacked the chief justice over a recent verdict declaring void 16th constitutional amendment scrapping parliament‚Äôs authority in impeaching Supreme Court judges. The government is reviewing the judgment to overturn it for being ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù. Hasina said the apex court defamed the parliament and attempted to snatch the presidential authority.

‚ÄúWhen you (chief justice) make criticism in this regard, then you will have to accept other‚Ä¶so you should have stepped down before making such a comment,‚Äù she said. Opposition party outside parliament BNP of ex-premier Khaleda Zia backed Sinha, saying the government was trying to control the higher judiciary by launching a vigorous campaign against the apex court judgment.

The row emerged in May when the apex court first refused to accept a government formulated code of conduct for lower judiciary judges, saying it undermined the Supreme Court in regulating them. Bangladesh‚Äôs original 1972 Constitution had empowered parliament to remove Supreme Court judges but a 1975 amendment entrusted the President with the authority.

In a subsequent amendment in 1978, when a military regime was in power, the authority was bestowed on Supreme Judicial Council, comprising apex court judges.

Netanyahu to press Putin over Iran‚Äôs Syrian foothold,"‚ÄúI will discuss with (Putin) Iran‚Äôs accelerated effort to entrench militarily in Syria,‚Äù Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThis creates a problem not just for Israel, but for all the of countries of the Middle East and the whole world.‚Äù (Amir Cohen, Pool via AP) ‚ÄúI will discuss with (Putin) Iran‚Äôs accelerated effort to entrench militarily in Syria,‚Äù Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThis creates a problem not just for Israel, but for all the of countries of the Middle East and the whole world.‚Äù (Amir Cohen, Pool via AP)

* Netanyahu says Iran seeking military entrenchment in Syria

* Russia a main power broker in Syrian conflict

* Black Sea resort of Sochi venue for Netanyahu-Putin talks

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will tell Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that he is concerned for Iran and its Shiite allies are expanding their presence in Syria as Moscow works to tamp down the Syrian civil war, Israeli officials said.

Russia has been the main broker of de-escalation zones set up in Syria in recent weeks. Israel worries those zones will allow Damascus‚Äôs Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah reinforcements to deploy in greater strength along its northern front.

Another sponsor of the zones is the United States, which shares Moscow‚Äôs focus on defeating Islamic State insurgents. Israel argues that Iran is the greater common threat.

Netanyahu and Putin will meet in Russia‚Äôs Black Sea resort of Sochi for their sixth series of talks since September 2015. Netanyahu is due back in Israel later in the day for talks with White House peace envoys Jared Kushner, Jason Greenblatt and Dina Powell.

‚ÄúI will discuss with (Putin) Iran‚Äôs accelerated effort to entrench militarily in Syria,‚Äù Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThis creates a problem not just for Israel, but for all the of countries of the Middle East and the whole world.‚Äù

A Kremlin statement said Putin and Netanyahu would ‚Äúexchange opinions on bilateral relations and the situation in the Middle East, primarily Syria, on fighting international terrorism, a Palestinian-Israeli settlement and other global and regional issues.‚Äù

Russia intervened in Syria on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2015, its forces fighting what it deems Sunni Islamist ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù in partnership with Iran and Hezbollah, Israel‚Äôs arch-foes. Moscow argues its big-power clout deters Iran or Hezbollah from opening a new front with Israel.

‚ÄúWe take the Israeli interests in Syria into account,‚Äù Alexander Petrovich Shein, Russia‚Äôs ambassador to Israel, told its Channel One television on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWere it up to Russia, the foreign forces would not stay.‚Äù

Netanyahu has publicly alleged, without providing details, that Iran plans to set up air and naval bases in Syria and his government has issued veiled threats to take pre-emptive action.

‚ÄúWe will find the common diplomatic and political interest with the United States, and later on with Russia, in order to combine our efforts and effect Iran‚Äôs return to its place,‚Äù Yoav Gallant, a member of Netanyahu‚Äôs security cabinet, told Israel‚Äôs Channel Two television.

‚ÄúWe should also prepare the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) so it ‚Ä¶ has relevant plans (for Syria), should that be required.‚Äù

In comments published this week, the chief of Israel‚Äôs air force said Israel had struck suspected Hezbollah arms shipments in Syria around 100 times during the Syrian civil war, apparently without Russian interference and rarely drawing retaliation.

"Liverpool dispatches Hoffenheim, back in Champions League","Liverpool advanced 6-3 on aggregate and will be placed in the pot of third seeds in Thursday‚Äôs draw. (Source: Reuters) Liverpool advanced 6-3 on aggregate and will be placed in the pot of third seeds in Thursday‚Äôs draw. (Source: Reuters)

Liverpool sealed its return to the Champions League group stage after a two-season absence by beating Hoffenheim 4-2 on Wednesday, producing a devastating attacking display without star playmaker Philippe Coutinho.

Emre Can scored goals either side of Mo Salah‚Äôs tap-in as the five-time European champions surged 3-0 ahead after just 21 minutes at Anfield, before Roberto Firmino added a fourth in the second half against his old club.

Liverpool advanced 6-3 on aggregate and will be placed in the pot of third seeds in Thursday‚Äôs draw, as England‚Äôs fifth representative in Europe‚Äôs elite club competition.

Coutinho remains missing for Liverpool officially both ill and injured amid sustained interest from Barcelona. But the Reds didn‚Äôt miss the Brazil playmaker against Hoffenheim, which left itself open at the back in an attempt to recover from a 2-1 first-leg deficit.

The German team, playing in Europe for the first time this season, could not handle Liverpool‚Äôs front three of Salah, Firmino and the electric Sadio Mane.

Running onto Mane‚Äôs backheel, Can scored with a deflected shot in the 10th minute and Salah bundled in a rebound from close range in the 18th after Georginio Wijnaldum sidefooted against the post. Then, in another counterattack featuring a backheel from Mane, Firmino dug out a cross to the far post that the unmarked Can volleyed into the net.

With his team now needing five goals to progress, Hoffenheim‚Äôs 30-year-old coach, Julian Nagelsmann, threw on an extra attacker in the 24th minute and Mark Uth had an immediate impact, drilling a low shot into the corner four minutes later.

Neither defense covered itself in glory in the first half, and the goals kept coming after halftime. Jordan Henderson robbed Hoffenheim captain Kevin Vogt to run through on goal, before passing across for Firmino to slot into the bottom corner in the 63rd.

Sandro Wagner headed in a late goal for Hoffenheim. Chelsea, Tottenham, Manchester City and Europa League winner Manchester United will be the other English teams in the group stage.

Qarabag became Azerbaijan‚Äôs first Champions League group representative after advancing on away goals, following a 2-1 loss at FC Copenhagen. It was 2-2 on aggregate.

The other three teams to qualify Wednesday were CSKA Moscow, Sporting and Apoel Nicosia.

"Libya‚Äôs former PM Ali Zeidan kidnapped in Tripoli, say family members","Since Kadhafi‚Äôs fall, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have been obliged to depend on rival militias that are battling for control of the North African country. Since Kadhafi‚Äôs fall, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have been obliged to depend on rival militias that are battling for control of the North African country.

Libya‚Äôs former prime minister Ali Zeidan has been kidnapped by an armed group in war-torn Tripoli and not been heard from in nine days, family members and friends said today. Zeidan, who became premier in November 2012, was dismissed by Libya‚Äôs parliament in March 2014 amid accusations that public funds had been embezzled. He left the country soon afterwards, in defiance of a travel ban issued by the attorney general.

Zeidan had returned to Libya in early August for the first time since his dismissal and was planning a Tripoli press conference to respond to his critics, according to Karam Khaled, a friend who accompanied him. He said the former premier‚Äôs visit had been coordinated with Fayez al-Sarraj, premier in the country‚Äôs United Nations-backed Government of National Accord.

‚ÄúIt was the GNA that prepared the visit, including protocol at the airport and the hotel reservation,‚Äù Khaled said. He said an armed group‚Äôs first attempt to seize Zeidan on August 12 was foiled by hotel guards.

He said the gunmen were from the GNA-linked Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade, a militia of former rebels from the NATO-backed 2011 uprising that led to the overthrow and killing of longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi. ‚ÄúGunmen from the same group returned the next day and we were obliged to hand them Zeidan,‚Äù Khaled said.

‚ÄúSince then, we have had no information on where he is being held or his condition,‚Äù he said, criticising the ‚Äúsilence‚Äù of the unity government. The ex-prime minister‚Äôs son Zeidan Zeidan said the family had no news of his father‚Äôs whereabouts. ‚ÄúWe have nothing so far,‚Äù he said by phone from the United Arab Emirates, where he lives.

He said his father‚Äôs lawyer had told him no court cases had been brought against the former premier. ‚ÄúThis was indeed a kidnapping and not an arrest,‚Äù he said, adding that the family is worried for the health of his father, who is 67.

In October 2013, gunmen seized the then premier from Tripoli‚Äôs luxury Corinthia Hotel, but he was released after several hours. Since Kadhafi‚Äôs fall, Libya has been plagued by security problems and political actors have been obliged to depend on rival militias that are battling for control of the North African country.

"‚ÄòPoets are self-motivated souls, poetry is compulsion‚Äô: Kiriti Sengupta","‚ÄúYou have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words‚Äù, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) ‚ÄúYou have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words‚Äù, said Kiriti Sengupta. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)

Of all romanticism associated with poetry, the ethereal and carefree life of a poet is perhaps the most adored. But is this ‚Äî the state of a poet‚Äôs being ‚Äî the reason for the existence of poetry, and, more so, what is a poem‚Äôs purpose?

There are no wars to be won through poetry, no great intentions behind a poem‚Äôs composition and it is more of a compulsion for self-motivated souls than a mere hobby, says Kiriti Sengupta, a gifted Indian poet, who has more than 17 books of poetry to his credit.

‚ÄúI think writing poetry cannot be defined as a favourite pastime for a writer. An honest poet writes poetry out of sheer compulsion. Poets write poetry when they think it will do justice to their thoughts or expressions. There are several other ways for conveying messages, observations,and experiences, but poetry is written only when poets think they can do no better without indulging in this genre of literature,‚Äù Sengupta told IANS in an interview.

Elaborating, the much-acclaimed poet from West Bengal said that he had no ‚Äúgreat intention‚Äù when he started composing poetry and even now he does not entertain ideas of ‚Äúchanging the society‚Äù through his poems. ‚ÄúPoetry does not change anything. It does not initiate a change either. Poetry makes you think, makes you aware, and it makes you revisit your concerns, which may include your agonies as well,‚Äù he added.

Sengupta‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy Glass of Wine‚Äù is almost autobiographical and is now a part of India‚Äôs first poetry trilogy, ‚ÄúDreams of the Sacred and Ephemeral‚Äù, which also bears two other works, ‚ÄúThe Reverse Tree‚Äù and ‚ÄúHealing Waters Floating Lamps‚Äù. In the first two collections, one finds verses placed alongside prose. Sengupta stressed on the fact that he wanted to eliminate the apathy of a common reader towards poetry and thus a mix of prose and poetry was the immediate option.

But poetry is considered to be one of the finest expressions of literature and, even today, it is widely read and adored. How fulfilling is the experience of a poet then?

‚ÄúYou have a definite purpose when you write a poem. You either convey a message you intended to, or you showcase your cerebral prowess to juggle words. Whatever be your objective, if you do it well, you are happy at the end of the day. Prose writing is generally more time-consuming, but then, there are poems that, no matter if they are long or short, take days and even weeks to write and finish,‚Äù quipped the poet.

And then there is the writer‚Äôs bloc. Like all creative people, a poet is no stranger to this rather depressing phenomenon, but Sengupta says that one has to live with it as it is a part of the journey.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve my share of non-productive days when I fail to write. After publishing more than 17 books I don‚Äôt find it stressful or alarming any more. I just feel bad about it, but it is only when I read other poets‚Äô work. See, it is extremely important to keep abreast of the latest happenings in the field of poetry, especially when someone is seriously engaged in it,‚Äù he maintained.

Sengupta also contested the idea that poetry has taken a backseat in recent years and said that the reality is actually contrary to popular belief. There has been a rise in poetry consciousness across India, he said, and we have more than one organisation in every city promoting poetry among new readers, especially youngsters. It is, however, debatable whether they promote quality work and enhance the availability of quality work.

He also emphasised that it is indeed impossible ‚Äúto earn a living from writing poetry‚Äù in India. ‚ÄúPoets are self-motivated souls who write poems for the joy derived from creating a work of art,‚Äù said the poet, whose upcoming chapbook of verses is titled ‚ÄúSolitary Stillness‚Äù and is due to be published in August.

Bansi Lal Arrested

Former Defence Minister Bansi Lal was arrested in his hometown of Bhiwani on charges of embezzlement of Haryana Youth Congress funds totalling about 5 lakhs.

77 Replaces Coke

The new beverage, intended to replace Coca Cola in the country, has been named ‚Äú77‚Äù. The credit for suggesting the name, along with an unexpected cash award of Rs 10,000, go to the veteran parliamentarian, H.V. Kamath. The drink, developed by the Central Food Technological Research Institute, will be marketed by the public sector Modern Bakeries. It is unlikely that ‚Äú77‚Äù will be marketed in 1978.

JP on Indira

Jayaprakash Narayan clarified the circumstances in which, after his meeting with Indira Gandhi on August 13, he had said she had a ‚Äúbrighter future than her bright past‚Äù. JP told newspersons in Patna that what he said had to be judged in the context of ‚Äúmy nature, my relationship with the Nehru family, my feeling for her as a daughter‚Äù although he had himself suffered before and during the Emergency.

Total Revolution

Jayaprakash Narayan advised the youth, Sarvodaya workers and all others who believed in social change through a peaceful total revolution to address themselves to the task of forming people‚Äôs committees from the village to the state levels.

UFC gets aggressive with technology to enhance its fights,"WME-IMG bought the UFC last year for more than billion WME-IMG bought the UFC last year for more than billion

The UFC is turning to a high-tech platform that could enhance the way fans watch fights. The world‚Äôs leading mixed martial arts promotion has reached a partnership with Heed. The joint venture between WME-IMG and AGT International wants to change the way fans connect with sports at home or at a live event through sensor-measured data.

WME-IMG bought the UFC last year for more than $4 billion. ‚ÄúOur goal is to revolutionize our sport, our events and ultimately enhance the fan experience,‚Äù UFC CFO Andrew Schleimer said.

Heed also has struck deals with Professional Bull Riders and Euroleague basketball. The new format uses sensors that collect data on everything from fan and competitor emotion to real-time event tracking that could change how fights, bull rides or other events are scored.

‚ÄúThis gives us a solution that is better than the human alternative to judging the difficulty of a bull ride,‚Äù PBR CEO Sean Gleason said.

Gleason said PBR would roll out a side-by-side system in January and use the Heed technology as a full replacement to human judging in 2019.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have bull meters or information on G-forces that were applied that are available in television, digital products and social apps,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt helps new fans understand the difficulty and nuances of bull riding.‚Äù

No bull, PBR believed science can almost reinvent the sport. Heed will outfit both bull and rider with technology that measures spin, direction changes, kicks and rider control.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only an informational and educational tool for fans but will help new fans understand the difficulties and nuances of bull rides,‚Äù Gleason said. ‚ÄúNone of us have been on a bull, so it‚Äôs hard to have a frame of reference to how difficult bull riding is and how athletic it is. This tool will help explain that in scientific data. That will be great for the sport. This is revolutionary, not evolutionary for our sport. We are incorporating technology into the core of our scoring and the competitive results.‚Äù

At the premier European basketball competition, the EuroLeague, sensors will be deployed in all 16 arenas. They will collect data from fans, players and coaches. Heed will transform this information into video content and performance reports for fans on site and at home through TV broadcasting, social media and other digital distribution channels.

Heed sampled its technology on an old UFC fight that kept a running tally of blocks, jabs, hooks, overhands and uppercuts on the side and bottom of the screen.

‚ÄúFight Pass could be a very unique place to have some of these specific content and stories that we‚Äôre creating with Heed,‚Äù Schleimer said.

Heed says its technology can track fan or fighter emotions ranging from sadness and surprise to disgust and fear. The UFC said those tools, along with the fight tracking, could help the company stay more informed on a fighter‚Äôs health.

‚ÄúWe believe there‚Äôs a tremendous opportunity for us as UFC and for the fighters to benefit from a health and safety perspective,‚Äù Schleimer said. ‚ÄúJust by virtue of the types of things that we‚Äôre capturing, we‚Äôre going to be very much focused on how we can leverage that to enhance our brand, our promotion and our athletes, which we‚Äôre always looking to do, anything related to health and safety.‚Äù

Umar Akmal Umar submits reply to PCB‚Äôs showcause notice,"Umar apparently in his reply has described Arthur‚Äôs behavior as ‚Äúintolerable‚Äù which had forced him to go public with his grievances. Umar apparently in his reply has described Arthur‚Äôs behavior as ‚Äúintolerable‚Äù which had forced him to go public with his grievances.

Pakistan Test batsman Umar Akmal on Wednesday submitted his reply to the show cause notice issued to him by the Pakistan Cricket Board after an altercation with national team‚Äôs head coach, Mickey Arthur.

Umar apparently in his reply has described Arthur‚Äôs behavior as ‚Äúintolerable‚Äù which had forced him to go public with his grievances.

The PCB issued the show cause to Umar after he went to media last week following an altercation with Arthur at the national cricket academy.

The board has charged him with violating his terms of contract by going to the media without prior permission and making serious allegations against a team official.

Umar has accused Arthur of using abusive language against him during the altercation which occured in the presence of chief selector, Inzamam-ul-Haq and national academy coach, Mushtaq Ahmed.

Umar told the media today that he had no alternative but to make his grievances public after the way he was treated.

‚ÄúI have been facing problems for the last three to four years and I hope that the PCB investigates the matter properly and my point of view is also heard,‚Äù he said, adding that he would accept the PCB decision.

Arthur had denied using abusive language against Umar, who last played in a Test for Pakistan in 2011 and in a one-day international in Australia in January.

Since then Arthur claims Umar has failed several fitness tests and it was after he failed a fitness test in England that he was sent back home from the Champions Trophy.

Umar claims the fitness tests in England were a dummy to oust him as he had been cleared by the selectors before joining the team in England for the Champions Trophy.

Pakistan‚Äôs former head coach, Waqar Younis who was succeeded by Arthur last year in June has also made it clear that Umar had ‚Äúissues‚Äù which he needed to sort out.

‚ÄúI had told the PCB he has issues and he has attitude problems. He is lacking in cricket discipline. At times I felt sorry for him because he was wasting his talent and career,‚Äù Waqar said on Geo Super channel.

Waqar said the latest incident involving Umar could spell the end for him if he didn‚Äôt seek help and drastically worked on his ‚Äúissues‚Äù.

‚ÄúHe will also have to work exceptionally hard and perform extraordinarily in domestic cricket to get back into the team now. I don‚Äôt understand what he is trying to do with himself.‚Äù

Qatar restores diplomatic ties to Iran amid regional crisis,"Qatar restored full diplomatic relations with Iran early on Thursday, disregarding the demands of Arab nations now locked in a regional dispute with the energy-rich country that it lessen its ties to Tehran. (Source: Reuters/File) Qatar restored full diplomatic relations with Iran early on Thursday, disregarding the demands of Arab nations now locked in a regional dispute with the energy-rich country that it lessen its ties to Tehran. (Source: Reuters/File)

Qatar restored full diplomatic relations with Iran early on Thursday, disregarding the demands of Arab nations now locked in a regional dispute with the energy-rich country that it lessen its ties to Tehran. In announcing its decision, Qatar did not mention the diplomatic crisis roiling Gulf Arab nations since June, when Qatar found its land, sea and air routes cut off by its neighbors over Doha‚Äôs policies across the Mideast.

However, the move comes just days after Saudi Arabia began promoting a Qatari royal family member whose branch of the family was ousted in a palace coup in 1972. ‚ÄúQatar has shown it is going to go in a different direction,‚Äù said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University who lives in Seattle.

‚ÄúIt could very well be calculated toward reinforcing the point that Qatar will not bow to this regional pressure placed upon it.‚Äù Qatar‚Äôs Foreign Ministry announced early Thursday that the country‚Äôs ambassador would return to Tehran. Qatar pulled its ambassador in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia‚Äôs execution of a prominent Shiite cleric sparked attacks on two Saudi diplomatic posts in Iran, a move to show solidarity with the kingdom.

‚ÄúThe state of Qatar expressed its aspiration to strengthen bilateral relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran in all fields,‚Äù a short Foreign Ministry statement said. Iranian state media acknowledged the development, without elaborating.

Despite recalling its ambassador in 2016, Iran and Qatar maintained their valuable commercial ties. Qatar and Iran share a massive offshore natural gas field, called the South Pars Field by Tehran and the North Field by Doha.

That gas field‚Äôs vast reserves made Qataris have the highest per capita income in the world, as well as funded the nation‚Äôs Al-Jazeera satellite news network and secured hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

"Severe Typhoon Hato wreaks havoc in Hong Kong, flights cancelled, trading delayed","Hong Kong braced for Typhoon Hato, a maximum category 10 storm on Wednesday, with hundreds of flights cancelled, trading in financial markets suspended and schools and most businesses in the Asian financial hub closed. Streets were largely deserted as winds intensified and rain lashed down, with many skyscrapers in the heart of the financial centre in darkness as the city battened down for one of the worst storms in years.

Hato churned up water in Hong Kong‚Äôs iconic Victoria Harbour and triggered large swells and massive waves on some of the city‚Äôs most popular beaches, with the weather observatory warning of serious flooding in low-lying areas. Maximum winds near Hato‚Äôs centre were recorded at a destructive 155 kmh (95 mph). Gusts in some residential areas were already causing damage, sending tarpaulins, roof screens and tree branches flying through the air.

A senior scientific officer for the Hong Kong observatory said sea levels could rise up to five metres (15 feet) in some places. The weather observatory issued a signal 10 storm warning, its highest weather warning, and said Hato will be closest to the territory in the next few hours, skirting about 50 km (31 miles) to the south of Hong Kong, and warned of flash floods.

Winds intensified in the morning, with the maximum sustained winds recorded at Tate‚Äôs Cairn and Waglan Island at 77 kmh (48 mph) and 72 kmh (48 mph), with maximum gusts of 103 kmh (64 mph) and 86 kmh (53 mph) respectively. Trading in Hong Kong‚Äôs financial markets was delayed on Wednesday morning, the stock exchange said. Trading will be suspended for the whole day if storm signal 8 or higher is in place at noon.

The city‚Äôs flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, said the storm would ‚Äúseverely‚Äù impact flight operations, with the majority of flights to and from Hong Kong between 2200 GMT Tuesday and 0900 GMT Wednesday to be cancelled. Other transport services, including ferries to the gaming hub of Macau and outlying islands in Hong Kong, were suspended.

Financial markets, schools, businesses and non-essential government services close when the signal 8 or above is hoisted. Typhoon Nida in August last year was the last storm to close the stock exchange for the whole day.

Over seven years after advocate Shahid Azmi was shot dead in his Kurla office, charges were framed against four accused in the case. The sessions court framed charges including murder and criminal conspiracy. The court had on Saturday stated that there is ‚Äúsufficient ground‚Äù to frame charges against the accused. Devendra Jagtap, Pintoo Dagale, Vinod Vichare and Hasmukh Solanki have pleaded not guilty.

Advocate Khalid Azmi, Shahid‚Äôs younger brother, who is an intervener in the case, said that though the various applications filed by the accused from time to time led to delay in the trial, he is hopeful that the trial will be concluded soon. ‚ÄúThe prosecution was ready with the draft charges in 2015.

The accused had filed for discharge and bail, the hearings for which then took place. I am hopeful though it has taken over seven years, the trial will soon reach its conclusion and the culprits will be served the maximum punishment,‚Äù Khalid said.

The main accused in the case, Jagtap, had also filed for bail claiming delay in beginning trial, but it was rejected by the court. Shahid, who has represented accused in terror cases including the July 11, 2011 serial train blasts and who was instrumental in the acquittal of two men in the 26/11 terror attack, was shot dead in his office at Taximen‚Äôs colony in Kurla on February 11, 2010. The police had initially booked five men including gangster Santosh Shetty who was eventually discharged from the case.

Two of the accused, Dagale and Vichare, are currently out on bail.The men were booked on charges including section 302 (murder), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault) and under section 3, 25 and 27 of the Arms Act.

"EPFO to go paperless, all services a click away by August 2018","The EPFO runs three schemes ‚Äî Employees Provident Fund Scheme 1952, Employees Pension Scheme 1995 and Employees Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme 1976. The EPFO runs three schemes ‚Äî Employees Provident Fund Scheme 1952, Employees Pension Scheme 1995 and Employees Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme 1976.

Retirement fund body EPFO will go paperless by August next year as part of Digital India initiative, which would improve delivery of services for its five crore subscribers. The Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), which runs social security schemes like EPF, pension and insurance for formal sector workers, has already launched a host of online services like EPF withdrawals.

This will be a big boom for the formal sector workers as well as their employers. The online facility would help the EPFO do away with the public interface for reducing chances of corruption and public harassment. ‚ÄúThe EPFO has set a target. We have decided to make electronic paper-free organisation by next the Independence Day where all services will be provided electronically (through online or mobile handsets),‚Äù Central Provident Fund Commissioner V P Joy said after flagging of a Tiranga Yatra.

He further said that once the EPFO goes paperless, people would not have to visit the offices to get their work done and save man hours. Joy also talked about the EPFO‚Äôs housing scheme where the body provides facility to make down payment to buy home and pay equated monthly instalment through their EPF accounts.

The EPFO has a corpus of over Rs 10 lakh crore. It had managed investible deposits of Rs 1.5 lakh crore last fiscal. The EPFO runs three schemes ‚Äî Employees Provident Fund Scheme 1952, Employees Pension Scheme 1995 and Employees Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme 1976.

US slaps sanctions on 16 Russian and Chinese entities for supporting North Korea,"The sanctions target third-country companies and individuals that assist already-designated persons who support North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The sanctions target third-country companies and individuals that assist already-designated persons who support North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

The US today slapped sanctions on 10 Russian and Chinese companies and six individuals for helping in advancing North Korea‚Äôs missile and nuclear weapons programme by conducting business with the reclusive nation. As a result of today‚Äôs action, any property or interests in property of the designated persons in the possession or control of US persons or within the United States must be blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them, the US Treasury Department said in a statement.

The sanctions target third-country companies and individuals that assist already-designated persons who support North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, deal in the North Korean energy trade, facilitate its exportation of workers, and enable sanctioned North Korean entities to access US and international financial systems.

‚ÄúTreasury will continue to increase pressure on North Korea by targeting those who support the advancement of nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and isolating them from the American financial system,‚Äù said Treasury Secretary Steven T Mnuchin.

Some of the prominent companies and individuals slapped with sanctions are China-based Dandong Rich Earth Trading Co, Moscow-based Gefest-M LLC and its director, Russian national Ruben Kirakosyan and China and Hong Kong-based Mingzheng International Trading Limited.

‚ÄúIt is unacceptable for individuals and companies in China, Russia, and elsewhere to enable North Korea to generate income used to develop weapons of mass destruction and destabilise the region,‚Äù Mnuchin said. ‚ÄúWe are taking actions consistent with UN sanctions to show that there are consequences for defying sanctions and providing support to North Korea, and to deter this activity in the future,‚Äù he said.

The Treasury also designated three Chinese coal companies collectively responsible for importing nearly half a billion dollars‚Äô worth of North Korean coal between 2013 and 2016.

US defense secretary in Iraq as troops battle for Tal Afar,"US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (REUTERS/Toru Hanai) US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (REUTERS/Toru Hanai)

US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Iraq on Tuesday just days after the start of an offensive to oust Islamic State from the city of Tal Afar, with talks focused on backing Iraqi efforts to stabilise areas recaptured from the militant group. Prior to arriving, Mattis said the fight against Islamic State was far from over despite recent successes by Western-backed Iraqi government forces.

The battle for Tal Afar would be difficult, US officials said. Iraqi security forces opened the offensive to take back Tal Afar on Sunday, their latest objective in the war following the recapture of Mosul after a nine-month campaign that left much of the city in ruins. Lying 80 km (50 miles) west of Mosul in Iraq‚Äôs far north, Tal Afar is a long-time stronghold of the hardline Sunni Muslim insurgents,

‚ÄúISIS‚Äô days are certainly numbered, but it is not over yet and it is not going to be over anytime soon,‚Äù Mattis told reporters in Amman. Mattis said that after retaking Tal Afar, Iraqi forces would move against the western Euphrates River valley. Brigadier General Andrew Croft, responsible for coalition air operations over Iraq, said that between 10,000 and 20,000 civilians remained in Tal Afar. The plight of civilians was a big factor in the battle of Mosul as Islamic State tried to keep them areas it controlled to act as human shields against air strikes and artillery bombardments. Several thousand are believed to have been killed.

Croft said that over the past two or three months, he had seen a fracturing in Islamic State leadership. ‚ÄúIt just seems less coordinated. It appears more fractured, less robust, and sort of flimsy, is the word I would use‚Ä¶it is sporadic,‚Äù Croft told reporters. Islamic State leaders fled Mosul during the fighting there and the whereabouts of its chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are unknown. Unconfirmed reports in the past few months have said he is dead.

Brett McGurk, US special envoy to the coalition, said that while the battle for Tal Afar would be difficult, Iraqi forces had retaken 235 square km (90 miles) in the first 24 hours. US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mattis, who will meet Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Defence Minister Arfan al-Hayali, will discuss the future of US forces in Iraq after the recapture of the remaining cities under Islamic State, and the role they could play in stabilizing operations.

The officials said that while big cities like Mosul have been largely been cleared of Islamic State militants, there were concerns about the ability of Iraqi forces to hold territory. Mattis said pockets of resistance remained in west Mosul, including sleeper cells. Iraqi security forces were capable of carrying out simultaneous operations, he added.

Islamic State is also on the back foot in Syria, where Kurdish and Arab militias backed by the US-led coalition have captured swathes of its territory in the north and are assaulting its main Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. McGurk said about 2,000 Islamic State fighters remained in Raqqa and as much as 60 percent of the city had been retaken. The jihadist group is now falling back deeper into the Euphrates valley region of eastern Syria.

Mattis said the next step for forces fighting Islamic State in Syria would be a move against the middle Euphrates valley, a reference to the militants‚Äô stronghold in Deir al-Zor province southeast of Raqqa.

KURDISH REFERENDUM

A US official also said Mattis would press Massoud Barzani, president of the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government, to call off a planned referendum on independence. Iraq‚Äôs Kurds have said they will hold the referendum on Sept. 25 despite concerns from Iraq‚Äôs neighbors who have Kurdish minorities within their borders and a US request to postpone it. However, a senior Kurdish official said the Kurds may consider the possibility of a postponment in return for financial and political concessions from the central government in Baghdad.

McGurk said the Kurdish delegation‚Äôs recent visit to Baghdad was encouraging. The Pentagon signed an agreement with Peshmerga forces last year to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and equipment. The US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the memorandum of understanding would expire soon and suggested that Mattis could use it as a bargaining chip.

The United States and other Western nations fear the vote could ignite a new conflict with Baghdad and possibly neighboring countries, diverting attention from the ongoing war against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

Former CIA agent wants to buy Twitter to kick Donald Trump off,"Former undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson (L) is looking to crowdfund enough money to buy Twitter so President Donald Trump can‚Äôt use it. (File Photo) Former undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson (L) is looking to crowdfund enough money to buy Twitter so President Donald Trump can‚Äôt use it. (File Photo)

Former undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson is looking to crowdfund enough money to buy Twitter so President Donald Trump can‚Äôt use it. Wilson launched the fundraiser last week, tweeting: ‚ÄúIf (at)Twitter executives won‚Äôt shut down Trump‚Äôs violence and hate, then it‚Äôs up to us. (hash)BuyTwitter (hash)BanTrump.‚Äù The GoFundMe page for the fundraiser says Trump‚Äôs tweets ‚Äúdamage the country and put people in harm‚Äôs way.‚Äù

As of Wednesday morning, she had raised less than $6,000 of her $1 billion goal.

In an emailed statement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the low total shows that the American people like the Republican president‚Äôs use of Twitter. ‚ÄúHer ridiculous attempt to shut down his first amendment is the only clear violation and expression of hate and intolerance in this equation,‚Äù the statement read.

Wilson wrote on the fundraiser‚Äôs GoFundMe page that she hopes to raise enough money to buy a controlling interest of Twitter stock. If she doesn‚Äôt have enough to purchase a majority of shares, she said, she will explore options to buy ‚Äúa significant stake‚Äù and champion the proposal at Twitter‚Äôs annual shareholder meeting.

If Plame were to hit her $1 billion goal, she‚Äôd still fall far short of gaining a controlling interest in the company. As of Wednesday, a majority stake would cost roughly $6 billion. But a $1 billion stake would make her Twitter‚Äôs largest shareholder and give her a very strong position to exert influence on the company.

Twitter declined to comment Wednesday on Wilson‚Äôs tweet about seeking to buy the San Francisco-based company.

Wilson‚Äôs identity as a CIA operative was leaked by an official in President George W. Bush‚Äôs administration in 2003 in an effort to discredit her husband, Joe Wilson, a former diplomat who criticized Bush‚Äôs decision to invade Iraq. She left the agency in 2005.

Two children pulled from rubble on quake-hit Italian island,"Firefighters and rescuers pull out a boy, Mattias, from the collapsed building in Casamicciola, on the island of Ischia, near Naples, Italy, a day after a 4.0-magnitude quake hit the Italian resort island, Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2017. (Italian Carabinieri, HO/ANSA via AP) Firefighters and rescuers pull out a boy, Mattias, from the collapsed building in Casamicciola, on the island of Ischia, near Naples, Italy, a day after a 4.0-magnitude quake hit the Italian resort island, Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2017. (Italian Carabinieri, HO/ANSA via AP)

Firefighters in Italy freed a 7-month-old baby and his older brother from rubble early Tuesday following a 4.0-magnitude quake on the resort island of Ischia off Naples, and rescuers were working on helping a third brother who remained trapped. At least two people were killed in the quake that struck just before 9 pm (1900 GMT) Monday, while another 39 were injured and some 2,600 were left homeless.

The victims were an elderly woman who was in a church that crumbled in the quake, and a second person who has been located in the rubble but not yet extracted.

Video released from the firefighting service showed rescuers passing the baby, who was wearing a white onesie and appearing alert, out of the collapsed structure in hardest-hit Casamicciola at around 4 am. The news agency ANSA said cries of joy went up in the crowd and the boys‚Äô mother ran to take him.

One of the baby‚Äôs brothers was rescued some seven hours later, and quickly loaded onto a stretcher and into an ambulance.

A firefighter photo showed the boy, identified as Mattias, being pulled out of the rubble in just his underwear covered with cement dust. Firefighters said on Twitter that they had reached the other boy, named Ciro, and were working on extracting him.

The children‚Äôs father told RAI state television that boys were in a bedroom when the quake struck, while he and his wife were elsewhere in the house. The mother, who Italian media say is heavily pregnant, managed to escape through a window while rescuers helped the father.

Firefighter spokesman Luca Cari said they maintained voice contact with the two boys during the complex rescue operation to create an opening through the collapsed ceiling. The boys had been given bottles of water and a flashlight.

‚ÄúWe are in touch with both of the boys. We hear their voices and we are making ours heard to keep them calm,‚Äù Cari was quoted by ANSA as saying.

The quake hit during the height of the tourist season, and Italian television showed many visitors taking refuge in parks following the quake. Authorities began organizing ferries to bring tourists back to the mainland early Tuesday.

Together with the nearby island of Capri, Ischia is a favorite island getaway for the European jet set, famed in particular for its thermal waters. Casamicciola was the epicenter of an 1883 earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people.

Images from the quake zone show many buildings collapsed into rubble, while others showed signs of structural damage with deep cracks in exterior walls. Cars were overturned.

The extent of the damage for a relatively light quake raised questions about the quality of construction on the island in the seismically active area off Naples and the active volcano, and the prevalence of illegally built structures.

Fabrizio Pistolesi, the head of Italy‚Äôs national architecture advisory board, told SKY that many buildings on the island were built before seismic codes were adopted. He also cited the high incidence of illegal construction on Ischia and generally in the Campagna region that includes both the resort island and Naples.

‚ÄúWe know well that in Campagna, more than 200,000 homes were illegally constructed, we are talking about homes constructed in absolute scorn of seismic norms,‚Äù he told Sky TG24.

Former Naples prosecutor Aldo De Chiara told Corriere della Sera that most of the recently constructed buildings on Ischia were built without necessary permits, and many with poor quality cement. ‚ÄúWe warned about the risk of collapses also in the case of not particularly serious temblors,‚Äù De Chiara said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, what we had denounced, happened last night.‚Äù

The head of Italy‚Äôs Civil Protection Agency, Angelo Borrelli, told reporters that 2,000 people had been left homeless in Casamicciola and another 600 in Lacco Ameno. He said authorities were checking the stability of hotels to see if they could be used as temporary housing.

The quake came just two days shy of the one-year anniversary of a powerful 6.2-magnitude earthquake that devastated several towns in central Italy. The quake on Aug. 24, 2016 killed more than 250 people in Amatrice and beyond and set off a months-long series of powerful aftershocks that emptied many towns and hamlets of their people.

German foreign minister asks Berlin and Europe to back Turks who did not support Turkish President Erdogan,"‚ÄúErdogan‚Äôs approach clearly motivates some people to try to threaten and harrass my wife,‚Äù German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel said. (File ‚Äì AP Photos) ‚ÄúErdogan‚Äôs approach clearly motivates some people to try to threaten and harrass my wife,‚Äù German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel said. (File ‚Äì AP Photos)

Germany‚Äôs foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel said Berlin and the rest of Europe should back the ‚Äúdemocratically minded‚Äù majority of Turks who did not support President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in a dramatic hardening of Germany‚Äôs posture towards Ankara.

His remarks, at a campaign event for his Social Democratic Party (SPD), come amid sharply deteriorating relations between the NATO allies, after Erdogan urged German Turks to boycott Germany‚Äôs main parties in next month‚Äôs election.

‚ÄúMore than half the country is democratically minded. They didn‚Äôt support him,‚Äù Gabriel was quoted by press agency DPA as saying at the meeting in the western Saarland region. ‚ÄúI believe that many in Turkey are counting on Europe and Germany supporting Turkish democracy and not looking on helplessly.‚Äù

The remarks, coming after Erdogan told Gabriel to ‚Äúknow his place‚Äù and describing Germany‚Äôs main parties as ‚Äúenemies of Turkey‚Äù, are likely to anger Turkey. Erdogan accuses Germany of harbouring plotters behind last year‚Äôs bloody coup attempt against Erdogan. Turkey has arrested 50,000 in a crackdown, including European-Turkish citizens. Western politicians say the dragnet is a pretext for Erdogan to rid himself of his opponents.

A senior lawmaker from Chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs Christian Democrat party (CDU) went further. In a radio interview, foreign policy specialist Roderich Kiesewetter urged the government to consider freezing the foreign assets of ‚Äúthe Erdogan clan‚Äù. In his remarks on Monday evening, Gabriel was cautious on sanctions, saying that Germany did not want inadvertently to hit ‚Äúthe small restaurant owners and waiters on the west coast.‚Äù

Gabriel said the personal nature of Erdogan‚Äôs attacks on him had emboldened people to make threats against his wife at the dental surgery where she worked. ‚ÄúErdogan‚Äôs approach clearly motivates some people to try to threaten and harrass my wife,‚Äù he said.

The latest escalation in Ankara‚Äôs war of words with Berlin was triggered by Turkey‚Äôs use of an Interpol red notice to have Turkish-German writer Dogan Akhanli arrested in Spain. Accused of terrorism, Akhanli has been released but must remain in Spain while authorities assess Turkey‚Äôs extradition request.

‚ÄúI always thought I was safe in European countries and that the long hand of arbitrary arrogance couldn‚Äôt reach me here,‚Äù said the activist, who spent long periods in jail for left-wing activism before fleeing Turkey in 1991.

Gorakhpur tragedy: Yogi Adityanath orders action in hospital deaths,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath (Source: Express Photo/Vishal Srivastav) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath (Source: Express Photo/Vishal Srivastav)

Three days after Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Rajiv Kumar submitted his inquiry report into the deaths of 60 children in BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur this month, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday night ordered for action against half-a-dozen hospital staff and Pushpa Sales Pvt Ltd, the firm that had cut off oxygen supply allegedly over non-payment of dues.

Dr Kafeel Khan, who was in-charge of AES (acute encephalitis syndrome) ward when children died on August 10 and 11, will face maximum action. The chief minister‚Äôs call for action comes a day before his scheduled visit to Gorakhpur. In a press release issued late Wednesday evening, the government stated that all recommendations of the probe committee has been accepted.

It said the committee has recommended registration of criminal cases against former principal of BRD Medical College, Dr Rajeev Mishra; Dr Satish, in-charge of oxygen supply and head of anesthesia department; Dr Khan, in-charge of the 100-bed AES ward; and M/s Pushpa Sales.

The committee had recommended action under Prevention of Corruption Act against Dr Mishra, his wife Dr Purnima Shukla, and Gajanan Jaiswal, the medical college‚Äôs chief pharmacist. Adityanath has ordered disciplinary action against Dr Mishra, Dr Satish, Dr Khan, Gajanan and an accountant for dereliction in duty and behavior against rules laid down for the staff.

According to the government, directions have also been issued to register another case of criminal offence against Dr Khan for allegedly hiding facts in the affidavit he submitted to the Chief Medical Officer of Gorakhpur, and for ostensibly working in violation of rules of the Indian Medical Council.

The panel has recommended a special audit by the CAG into supply of medicines and chemicals in the medical college for the last three years. The government has already suspended Dr Mishra and Purnima Shukla. On Tuesday, Additional Chief Secretary Anita Bhatnagar Jain was removed from the Department of Medical Education.

The Race of a Lifetime,"‚ÄúOut on the sea, when you‚Äôre all alone, all your conditioned behaviours disappear. Even the conversation that you have with yourself is only of the most essential nature,‚Äù says Abhilash Tomy. (Photo Pradip Das) ‚ÄúOut on the sea, when you‚Äôre all alone, all your conditioned behaviours disappear. Even the conversation that you have with yourself is only of the most essential nature,‚Äù says Abhilash Tomy. (Photo Pradip Das)

Commander Abhilash Tomy is not afraid to be alone at sea. ‚ÄúSolitude in itself causes me no turmoil,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúIn fact, I dread other people‚Äôs company when out on a boat. I find it very stressful, not just because of the constant proximity but because you lose the freedom to just be yourself. Out on the sea, when you‚Äôre all alone, all your conditioned behaviours disappear. Even the conversation that you have with yourself is only of the most essential nature.

It could be said that Tomy‚Äôs experience in this matter is considerable. On March 31 in 2013, he had become the first Indian to complete a solo non-stop circumnavigation of the world by boat, a round-the-world trip that began on November 1, 2012. While at sea, he would spend his time doing chores around the boat, cooking, reading and snatching rest whenever possible. Of the 151 days of the trip, he spent 130 without catching sight of a single human being. ‚ÄúIt was a period of high stress, of course, and you‚Äôre on survival mode when you‚Äôre on the boat,‚Äù he says.

For Tomy, who works as a reconnaissance pilot in the Indian navy, the trip around the world was a way of living his boyhood fantasies of adventures at sea, inspired by books like Treasure Island and Moby-Dick. Now he is preparing for the Golden Globe Race ‚Äî a more arduous adventure that begins next June from Plymouth in the UK and commemorates the 50th anniversary of the 1968-69 Sunday Times Golden Globe Race.

The 1968 event was the first round-the-world yacht race and began with nine participants who set sail from Great Britain. The challenge was to complete an unassisted, non-stop, solo circumnavigation of the world via the Great Capes. Four competitors retired from the race before leaving the Atlantic Ocean, while one sailed past the Cape of Good Hope before retiring. A sixth, Nigel Tetley, had to abandon his boat, after it was severely damaged in a storm, while Frenchman Bernard Moitessier gave up after losing faith in the commercialised nature of the competition. One competitor, Donald Crowhurst, who had begun to show signs of depression and had started falsifying his position, killed himself before completing the journey. The only person who finished was Robin Knox-Johnston who, ironically, was initially seen as the sailor least likely to succeed in the race.

While there have been many technological advances in the last 50 years, the 2018 race is going to be challenging because it seeks to recreate the conditions under which Knox-Johnston and the others set sail. ‚ÄúThis means that we won‚Äôt be allowed to use any new technology that has been developed since then. If it didn‚Äôt exist in 1968, we can‚Äôt use it. So that means no GPS, electronic watches, electronic compass, electronic meter. We are permitted to use LED lights, a few solar panels and wind generators,‚Äù says Tomy. Even the boats would have to be of traditional construction, with no modern, faster designs allowed, so he has got a replica of Knox-Johnston‚Äôs 32 foot wooden sailboat made. ‚ÄúBasically, you‚Äôre on a small, slow boat and you can‚Äôt carry too much food or water. You also don‚Äôt have modern means of navigation. You can use a sextant, which is very accurate. But to get your positions, you would have to use a very accurate watch along with the sextant and this is usually a two-person job because even if you‚Äôre off by a second, it makes a difference of about one or two kilometres,‚Äù says the 38-year-old.

Then there‚Äôs the fact that on his last voyage around the world, Tomy could rely on detailed graphic representations of the weather to prepare himself and his boat. On the planned trip in 2018, he will have to rely entirely on weather reports heard over the radio and a barometer. But in Tomy‚Äôs opinion, the only major problem is the size of the boat. In 2012-13, the boat he used, Mhadei, was 56 feet long and weighed 23 tonnes. At a mere 32 feet and eight tonnes, the new boat Thuriya stands a greater chance of being upended by waves that can reach over 10 metres during a storm.

So how has Tomy been preparing for the upcoming adventure? ‚ÄúPhysically, I‚Äôm not doing much because in my experience, when you start working on the boat, you begin to develop the stamina and the muscles that you need the most. I‚Äôm taking calcium and vitamin D supplements a year in advance because in the Southern ocean, there‚Äôs little sunlight.‚Äù Is he prepared for 300-odd days alone at sea, with only the occasional dolphins and seagulls for company? Tomy grins. ‚ÄúMentally, I‚Äôll do just fine. I‚Äôve been alone on a boat in the sea before, so I know what to expect,‚Äù says he.

"Jain group condemns Sanjay Raut‚Äôs remarks, says will reply after Paryushan","Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut. (File Photo) Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut. (File Photo)

Even as Sena leaders criticised Jain monk Naypadmasagarji Maharaj for reportedly canvassing support for the BJP through a video message ahead of the Mira Bhayander civic polls, the monk continued to address devotees in Bhayander amid the Jain community‚Äôs observance of Paryushan, a period of penitence and introspection.

‚ÄúLet people say what they want to, if required we will reply to them after Paryushan,‚Äù said Muni Naypadmasagar to The Indian Express, adding that the community‚Äôs leaders and people would not talk or think ill about anybody during Paryushan.

Referring to Naypadmasagar‚Äôs sermon ahead of the polls, Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday not only threatened to register a complaint against him for violation of poll code of conduct, but also compared him to controversial televangelist Dr Zakir Naik.

The All India Jain Minority Cell condemned Raut‚Äôs statement against the monk. Naypadmasagr, however, maintained that replying to Raut would spoil the atmosphere of their holy week of Paryushan. Naypadmasagar (49) has a huge following within the community. He is also the founder of the Jain International Organisation (JIO). Every day during Paryushan, over 200 people attend his sermon in Bhayander.

One of Naypadmasagar‚Äôs disciples, Muni Dhyaanpadmasagar, told The Indian Express, ‚ÄúGuruji would not like to speak about Raut, elections or other political events. We avoid all these during Paryushan. Everybody knows who Sanjay Raut is, the language he has used against guruji and people of the Jain community. If Guruji influenced the Jain community to vote for the BJP, then what about other communities, why did they not vote for the Sena? There are hardly 30,000 to 40,000 voters who are Jains. So far, people voted in their favour, today when people found the reality they decided not to vote for them.‚Äù

In the twin towns of Mira Road and Bhayander, the Jains concede that the word of the religious leader holds tremendous influence over the community.

‚ÄúPost demonetisation, many traditional Gujarati and Jain voters were upset with the BJP as their businesses were impacted by the decision. However, CM Devendra Fadnavis and other BJP leaders, including Mangal Prabhat Lodha, met Naypadmasagarji to reach out to the Jains,‚Äù said Jitesh Jain, a resident of Mira Road.

According to residents, the monk in nearly all his sermons urged the community to use the polls to build pressure on their representatives to help shut slaughter houses on certain days of the year. He also asked Jains to vote for a ‚Äúmeat-free society‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe community‚Äôs sentiments were hurt last year when the shutdown of slaughter-houses on two days during Paryushan was lifted. Shiv Sena and a few other parties supported the meat sellers. Even people of Mira-Bhayander wanted to ensure this does not happen again. It is a sensitive matter for us,‚Äù said Madhur Shah, a resident of Bhayander.

Vietnam‚Äôs most powerful leader has called for greater unity among Southeast Asian states at a time the country has appeared increasingly isolated in challenging China‚Äôs territorial claims in the South China Sea.

Making the first visit by a Vietnamese communist party chief to Indonesia, Nguyen Phu Trong said in a speech televised at home on Wednesday that the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) needed to be unified in resolving territorial disputes.

‚ÄúDo not let ASEAN become a playing card for the competition among major countries,‚Äù Trong said, without identifying which he meant.

Vietnam has emerged as the most vocal opponent of China‚Äôs claims in the South China Sea, where more than $3 trillion in cargo pass every year.

To China‚Äôs annoyance, Vietnam held out an ASEAN meeting this month for language in a communique that noted concern about island-building and criticized militarization in the South China Sea.

Chinese pressure forced Vietnam to stop drilling for oil last month in a Vietnamese oil block that China claims. Beijing has also been angered by Vietnam‚Äôs growing defence links to the United States, Japan and India.

Some Southeast Asian countries are wary about the possible repercussions of defying Beijing by taking a stronger stand on the South China Sea. China claims most of the South China Sea, while Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei claim parts of the sea, which commands strategic sealanes and has rich fishing grounds along with oil and gas deposits.

After Indonesia, Trong is due to visit Myanmar.

Stoffel Vandoorne handed 35 place grid penalty for home race,"Vandoorne, who will be the first Belgian to compete in his home race since Jerome d‚ÄôAmbrosio in 2011, has scored one point so far this season with the Honda power unit lacking performance and reliability.

(Source: AP)

McLaren‚Äôs Stoffel Vandoorne will have a 35-place grid penalty for his home Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday due to power unit changes.

McLaren‚Äôs engine partners Honda confirmed the rookie would collect the penalty, that will leave him either last on the grid or starting from the pit lane, after an update aimed at improving reliability.

‚ÄúUnfortunately Stoffel will receive a grid penalty at his home grand prix, but it is important for us to introduce updates as soon as they are ready,‚Äù said Honda‚Äôs Formula One head Yusuke Hasegawa.

Drivers are penalised for exceeding their allocation of power units, and component parts, for the season.

Vandoorne, who will be the first Belgian to compete in his home race since Jerome d‚ÄôAmbrosio in 2011, has scored one point so far this season with the Honda power unit lacking performance and reliability.

He said he was still looking forward to the weekend and racing in front of his home fans for the first time in Formula One.

‚ÄúThe penalties were kind of inevitable with the issues we had earlier this season. Every new part we bring to the car now is giving us grid penalties and it‚Äôs a shame to start the weekend like that. ‚ÄúBut with the weather here, there‚Äôs maybe a lot of opportunities possible.‚Äù

McLaren announced on Wednesday that the 25-year-old would be continuing with them next season. His Spanish team mate Fernando Alonso, a double world champion, is still considering his options.

Honda said Alonso, who finished sixth in the previous race in Hungary, would not face any grid penalties this weekend.

On Tuesday, they met Health Minister Shankar Chaudhary and senior health officers before visiting the Civil Hospital in Asarwa.

‚ÄúThe main aim of the visit is to decide the further course of action to tackle swine flu in the coming days,‚Äù said Gaurav Dahiya from National Health Mission (NHM), who is coordinating the visit. Dahiya, however, refuted allegations that there has been delay on the part of the government in tackling the outbreak. ‚ÄúThere has been no delay in dealing with swine flu. It is not a knee-jerk reaction. We are doing our bit and making sure that medicines are available. The committee is here to give us suggestions on how to prevent further deaths.‚Äù

The three-member team will be looking at preparedness, labs and their facilities, will carry out death analysis and look at availability of medicines in Ahmedabad and Rajkot which have reported the maximum cases and deaths in the state.

"Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit claims he kept Army in loop, Army blew his cover","In an Army convoy, Lieutenant Colonel Shrikant Purohit leaves Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai, Wednesday. (Source: Express Photo/Narendra Vaskar) In an Army convoy, Lieutenant Colonel Shrikant Purohit leaves Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai, Wednesday. (Source: Express Photo/Narendra Vaskar)

A key defence of 2008 Malegaon blast accused Lt Col Shrikant Prasad Purohit, who stepped out of Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai Wednesday after being granted bail by the Supreme Court, was that he had infiltrated radical Hindutva groups as an intelligence officer and had informed his superiors about it.

In interviews, Purohit maintained that the Army always stood by him. But an inquiry, conducted by the Directorate General of Military Intelligence after it was informed by the Intelligence Bureau of his involvement, found that he had taken counter-measures to dissociate himself from the blast case and generated intelligence on the alleged involvement of accused Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur after learning from his sources that she was going to be held by the Maharashtra ATS.

The inquiry concluded that ‚Äúthe officer is highly indoctrinated, deals with illegal proliferation of weapons and hiding facts‚Äù. The inquiry report also said that his wife, Aparna Purohit, ‚Äúrevealed that her husband has deep hatred for Islam and he may be involved in activities directed against them‚Äù.

The inquiry report, dated July 27, 2011, was signed by a Major General, the then ADG MI (B). It stated that the first information regarding involvement of Lt Col Purohit was verbally conveyed by the then IB Director to the then Chief of Army Staff on October 22, 2008. At that time, Purohit was enrolled for a course in Arabic language at AEC Training College, Pachmarhi. The Malegaon blasts, which killed eight persons and left another 80 injured, took place on September 29, 2008.

However, by the time Director of MI 9 reached Pachmarhi to confront Purohit, the report stated, the element of surprise was lost since the media had already begun reporting on the alleged involvement of Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, and the raid by the Maharashtra ATS at Purohit‚Äôs house in Pune. ‚ÄúThus the officer was aware of him being subjected to questioning on specific issues. In fact, the officer had already taken adequate counter-measures to obliterate his linkages with the perpetrators by informing key persons to switch off mobile and adopt cover stories,‚Äù the report stated.

‚ÄúIn addition, on 13 Oct 08, on receiving confirmation from his informers about apprehension of Sadhvi by ATS, he telephonically informed CO SCLU, IO SCLU (Devlali) and initiated a written report to CCLU Team at Jabalpur intimating involvement of Sadhvi Pragya Singh in the Malegaon Bomb Blast,‚Äù the report stated.

It said that during inquiry and interrogation, ‚Äúhis arrogant behaviour, occasional absence from class, extreme religious mindset and attempt to purchase semi-auto carbine from‚Ä¶ a retired AEC officer settled in Pachmarhi was revealed‚Äù. The officers who conducted the inquiry also met Purohit‚Äôs wife who ‚Äúappeared in state of shock and even accused him for not heeding to her advice to disassociate with religious activities. She further revealed that her husband has deep hatred for Islam and he may be involved in activities directed against them,‚Äù the report stated.

The inquiry found that Purohit maintained a well-stocked library with books on Shivaji, Arabic language, ornithology and children‚Äôs literature. ‚ÄúHe specifically mentioned a book written by a Marathi author on mindset of Islam. A magazine of Hindu Mahasabha (Savarkar Gp) was also placed in the house. He took pride in explaining that books on Shivaji were purchased from a defunct library. An old sword was displayed in his house which he linked to Maratha Army of Peshwas,‚Äù the report stated.

The report mentioned an SUV and six phones that the officer owned. ‚ÄúBetween 07 Oct and 24 Oct 08, he used these mobile nos to warn his associates through direct calls and SMS. His close associates were told to switch off mobile no. and take new sim,‚Äù it stated. According to the report, when Purohit was questioned about his association with Abhinav Bharat, accused Ramesh Upadhyay and Bhonsala Military Academy, he was evasive. It said Purohit ‚Äúdid not give clue on the extent of his involvement‚Äù.

Congress engaging in false show of jubilation: Amit Shah on right to privacy,"BJP National Preisdent Amit Shah. (File ‚Äì PTI Photo) BJP National Preisdent Amit Shah. (File ‚Äì PTI Photo)

Welcoming the Supreme Court verdict declaring the right to privacy a fundamental right, BJP chief Amit Shah on Thursday attacked the Congress party for its jubilation over the judgment. ‚ÄúCongress is engaging in a false show of jubilation and vindication over Supreme Court verdict on right to privacy,‚Äù said Shah adding ‚Äúthose waxing eloquent on privacy architecture are responsible for India not having robust privacy law for decades.‚Äù

Shah said that he welcomes the SC judgment as it strengthens fundamental rights, personal liberty. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs judgment of the Supreme Court is a welcome judgment as it strengthens the Fundamental Rights and personal liberty. Our Government is committed to ensuring equitable social delivery, particularly to the poor in consonance to today‚Äôs judgment by Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court,‚Äù said Shah in an official statement.

Targeting Congress, Shah further said, ‚ÄúIt is strange that those who snatched away the Right to Life & Right to Liberty of millions of Indians by imposing emergency are standing today as guardians of our fundamental rights based on a misinterpretation of the judgment. It is equally strange that those who brought Section 66A & championed censoring on the Internet are speaking of liberties & rights.‚Äù

Earlier in the day, the Congress hailed the apex court verdict saying it was a major blow to ‚Äúfascist forces‚Äù and a rejection of the BJP‚Äôs ideology of ‚Äúsuppression through surveillance‚Äù. The judgment was a ‚Äúvictory for every Indian‚Äù, party vice president Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter.

"Paper Miracles: Sanjhi, the ancient art of hand cutting stencils from paper, gets a contemporary twist in an exhibition","Works from the exhibition ‚ÄúSanjhi Revisted‚Äù Works from the exhibition ‚ÄúSanjhi Revisted‚Äù

After many requests from curious onlookers, a fourth generation Sanjhi artist ‚Äî Mohan Kumar Verma from Mathura ‚Äî cuts a bird with flared wings taking flight. He does it with the help of handmade scissors and a tiny sheet of plucked paper with lightning fast speed. ‚ÄúThis is all that I learnt from our grandfather. I‚Äôd lost my father and needed to support my family financially while other children of my age studied,‚Äù says the 48-year-old artist, who was showcasing the art of Sanjhi and depicting his works in the exhibition ‚ÄúSanjhi Revisited‚Äù at Delhi‚Äôs Visual Arts Gallery, India Habitat Centre. The exhibition has been brought together by Delhi Crafts Council to celebrate their golden jubilee year. Over 80 artwork on display include depiction of domes flanked by minarets, decorated with designs of weeping willow, as clouds resembling Aladdin‚Äôs magical lamp hover from above. There is also a reinterpretion of Mughal garden illustrations from Good Earth‚Äôs coloring book Bagh-e-Bahar by another Sanjhi artist, Ashutosh Verma.

Sanjhi, the art of handcutting stencils from paper, is believed to have emerged over a 100 years ago as part of ritual decorations in the temples of Mathura and Vrindavan. The stencils depicting legends and pilgrimage locations associated with the life of Krishna are used to create intricate floor patterns or rangoli using coloured powder.

Purnima Rai, head of the organising committee and former President of Delhi Crafts Council, says, ‚ÄúWith architecture as one of the many themes in the exhibition, the artists have portrayed buildings used in traditional Sanjhi, and reproduced several other architectural designs. Art is currently in a flux and its various possibilities need to reach out to more people. This show is a step in that direction.‚Äù

With the help of handmade paper, banana rice paper and jute paper, Mohan has replicated Mughal jali works inspired by the designs found in classic Mughal architecture, against the backdrop of a mirror. Artist Ram Soni has extensively cut out a series of illustrations of vases, spilling with flowers, out of silver foil, displayed against a deep blue colored backdrop. In Bamboo with Parrots, Soni has captured a parrot in a variety of postures while sitting atop a stylised bamboo tree ‚Äî looking up at the sky and into the oblivion, searching for food and engaging with its counterpart.

As the craft enveloped into a declining phase in the early 20th century, where only a few temples in Vrindavan practiced it, the efforts of designers and NGOs including Delhi Crafts Council in recent decades have ensured a resurgence of the craft. Mohan says, ‚ÄúAlmost 25 years ago, when I was invited at the National Crafts Museum in Delhi to display my products, no one was really willing to buy them. Even if a sheet of artwork paper was priced for Rs 100, people would question us and ask why it deserved to be sold at such a high price. It was demotivating and I had almost thought of quitting the profession. But as Delhi Crafts Council pushed us to bring in modern interpretations on coasters, lamps and wedding invitation cards, our craft flourished.‚Äù Mohan points out that he had even designed an entire wedding tent using Sanjhi art in Delhi and a pandal for Durga Puja in Kolkata a few years ago, where the exteriors of the pandal and the jewellery and clothing of the goddess was made of paper cut stencils. With most of the pieces at the exhibition now bearing a circled red mark and few works priced over a lakh, they only serve as a positive sign of a brighter future for the ancient artform.

The exhibition is on at Visual Arts Gallery, India Habitat Centre, Lodhi Road, till August 12

Srijan scam: Congress demands Nitish Kumar resignation,"Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar (PTI Photo) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar (PTI Photo)

OVER THREE weeks after Nitish Kumar broke the grand alliance in Bihar and joined hands with the BJP, the Congress on Wednesday dragged him into the Srijan scam. It said the involvement of the Chief Minister in the scam cannot be ‚Äúdenied‚Äù and said the probe should be monitored by the high court. It also demanded the resignation of Nitish as well as his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi to ensure a fair probe.

Addressing a press conference at the AICC headquarters, senior Congress leader Manish Tewari said the scam took place during Modi‚Äôs tenure as Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister of Bihar. ‚ÄúHow is it possible that such large amount of money kept going out and coming back into the system without any knowledge of Modi. Either he doesn‚Äôt know his job or all this happened under his eyes. His involvement in this cannot be completely ruled out neither can the involvement of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar be denied,‚Äù the party said in a statement.

Asked when the Congress learnt about the scam and whether it was aware about it when it was part of the government, Tewari said, ‚ÄúIf the charge is that we are being opportunistic in terms of timing‚Ä¶ I rebut that at the outset. That the implications or the gravity of the scam unfolded as the reports emerged and surfaced. It is not as if we were privy to it or cognizant of it and therefore are now choosing to raise it when Nitish Kumar has joined the NDA.‚Äù

\‚ÄúThe fact is that material kept bubbling to the surface and finally when the dots were connected, it emerged that this was possibly the most wanton loot of treasury in the past 70 years. And the kind of names which are now emerging‚Ä¶.this requires a serious investigation that how come not only in once case, but in multiple cases, across multiple treasuries, in multiple districts you have this siphoning off taking place.‚Äù The Congress in a statement alleged Manorama Devi, who headed the NGO, is suspected to be well-connected with BJP and people close to Nitish.

Indonesia will buy 11 Sukhoi fighter jets worth $1.14 billion from Russia in exchange for cash and Indonesian commodities, two cabinet ministers said on Tuesday. The Southeast Asian country has pledged to ship up to $570 million worth of commodities in addition to cash to pay for the Suhkoi SU-35 fighter jets, which are expected to be delivered in stages starting in two years.

Indonesian Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita said in a joint statement with Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu that details of the type and volume of commodities were ‚Äústill being negotiated‚Äù. Previously he had said the exports could include palm oil, tea, and coffee. The deal is expected to be finalised soon between Indonesian state trading company PT Perusahaan Perdangangan Indonesia and Russian state conglomerate Rostec.

Russia is currently facing a new round of U.S.-imposed trade sanctions.

Meanwhile, Southeast Asia‚Äôs largest economy is trying to promote its palm oil products amid threats of a cut in consumption by European Union countries. Indonesia is also trying to modernise its ageing air force after a string of military aviation accidents. Indonesia, which had a $411 million trade surplus with Russia in 2016, wants to expand bilateral cooperation in tourism, education, energy, technology and aviation among others.

Court documents show that members of a Spanish extremist cell bought knives and an ax between the first and second fatal attacks in the country‚Äôs Catalonia region last week. The detail came light as National Court Judge Fernando Andreu issued orders to jail two of the surviving suspects without bail and provisionally freed another. A fourth was ordered held in police custody for another 72 hours. The documents say the cell had to improvise or carry out alternate plans of violence after the house where they were making bombs exploded on Wednesday night.

The judge says in the order released by the National Court late Tuesday: ‚ÄúThe blast truncated the initial plan of the terrorists and precipitated the succession of subsequent events.‚Äù Those events including the remaining attackers renting vans, the attacks carried out by one of them in Barcelona, and the attack with knives in Cambrils.

A judge has ordered two of the four surviving suspects in last week‚Äôs extremist attacks in Spain held without bail, another detained for 72 more hours and one freed. National Court Judge Fernando Andreu issued his orders after hearing the four answer questions on Tuesday about the vehicle attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils that killed 15 people.

Andreu said there was enough evidence to hold 21-year-old Mohamed Houli Chemlal and 28-year-old Driss Oukabir on preliminary charges of causing homicides and injuries of terrorist nature and of belonging to a terrorism organization.

By Shivshankar Menon

This is a remarkable work of scholarship in a long-neglected area ‚Äî state consolidation and frontier-making in the eastern Himalaya between 1910 and 1962. Unlike other books which have dealt with the high politics of the India-China relationship and boundary, it studies these issues from the ground up, from the point of view of the peoples and society. Coming when the Indian and Chinese states have accumulated hard power and are rubbing up against each other in their shared periphery, this history is a topical reminder of how we got to the present situation, and suggests alternate ways of looking at the processes of state formation and consolidation in the Indian and Chinese peripheries in the early 20th century.

The basic thesis is that existing analyses miss a fundamental element of Sino-Indian rivalry: the difficulty of coexisting in the Himalayas, a region whose distinct human landscape exposes India and China‚Äôs imperial nature. The 1962 war was preceded not just by military and diplomatic escalation, but by an older and increasingly tense shadowing contest to convince the eastern Himalayas‚Äô inhabitants that one state, and not the other, was the better alternative. Guyot-R√©chard sees India and China as post-imperial polities seeking to deepen their rule over the Himalayan region, where they encounter people starkly different from their ‚Äúcore‚Äù citizenry. She distinguishes between the behaviour of China and India. While China uses colonial policies on its geographic peripheries, independent India‚Äôs unity-in-diversity ideal coexisted with imperial strategies, and China and India see themselves as each other‚Äôs ‚Äòshadow state‚Äô in the Himalayas.

Based on research in the Arunachal Pradesh and Assam archives, original primary sources, and extensive interviews with those involved, the book naturally focuses much more closely on the Indian side, where sources are accessible. For the Chinese side, where sources are unavailable, limited or patchy, the author relies on deduction and inferred motives from revealed Chinese state behaviour. This could have opened her to the accusation that she is looking for keys lost somewhere else under a street lamp because that is where the light is. But the objectivity with which she handles the material avoids most pitfalls of this method ‚Äî of picking over Indian flaws and hesitations while the official Chinese narrative gains undeserved credence by comparison and equation. It is hard to see what more she could have done. She has obeyed the historian‚Äôs cardinal rule and followed the evidence.

The result of her considerable scholarship is an important book that covers significant themes in an increasingly important area with a professional historian‚Äôs care and precision. For instance, the book deals with the complicated and non-linear transition in the eastern Himalaya from empire to nation-state in India and China, where the process was completed in the early 20th century (and, implicitly, in Tibet where the transition from a pre-modern polity to the nation state was not completed). It describes competitive state expansion in successive episodes, the first of which, by China in 1910-12, set off what Guyot-R√©chard calls ‚Äúshadow state‚Äù behaviour, where India and China reacted and mirrored what they thought the other was doing to consolidate power and sovereignty in this border region, and not only on their side of the Himalaya.

In describing this process, she is also alert to multiple side-shows which influenced the main flow of events in unpredictable ways. One was the triangular differences between London, Calcutta/Delhi and Assam. For London, imperial interests in keeping Russia out of Tibet dictated accommodation with China, recognition of Chinese ‚Äúsuzerainty‚Äù over Tibet, and ruled out an interest in expanding into the eastern Himalaya. New Delhi/Calcutta saw the exercise of British rule and recognition of boundaries as necessary both for security and commercial reasons but were unwilling to prioritise or invest. And, Assam saw Delhi‚Äôs regular relapse into a ‚Äúpolicy of aloofness‚Äù as dangerous and sought a forward policy on the ground in terms of presence, civilian administration and development.

Another interesting theme was the impetus for the 1910 Treaty with Bhutan from Qing and Tibetan assertions of sovereignty in the eastern Himalaya, and Bhutan‚Äôs role in Calcutta and London‚Äôs Tibet and China policy. As for China, when she first tried to conquer Dzayul in May 1910 and entered the Lohit valley, the King of Bhutan was informed that his kingdom was China‚Äôs protectorate, and he was ordered to let Chinese currency circulate freely and to confine diplomatic relations to Beijing only ‚Äî plus √ßa change‚Ä¶! This first burst of Qing China‚Äôs forward policy in the eastern Himalaya was soon ended by Tibetan resistance and the fall of the dynasty at home.

Shadow States: India, China and the Himalayas, 1910‚Äì1962

B√©r√©nice Guyot-R√©chard

Cambridge University Press

321 pages

Rs 550

This is a book full of discovered delights, of repetitive patterns of behaviour by governments in India and China. One of them is the ‚Äúrecourse to force [which] had been a long-standing way of managing vulnerability on the part of China-based polities‚Äù that several instances in the book attest to. It is particularly good on the ebb and flow of administration in the eastern Himalayan borderland. Chapters 3 and 4 reveal the development dimension and the relationship between the people and the state in NEFA. The new Indian state differed from its predecessor, but carried on its legacy. With the 1950 Assam earthquake, independent India changed the coercive state vocabulary by adding development initiatives and relief. The story of state-building is told clinically and well.

The real value of this book is its emphasis on the role of the people of the eastern Himalaya and what it says of ‚Äúever-changing state-society relations on either side of the eastern Himalayas‚Äù. It describes local peoples‚Äô preference for the looser arrangements of India over the monopolistic Chinese approach to their polities and societies. It was this preference that saw the relatively smooth return of the Indian administration into these areas after the 1962 war, despite Chinese attempts during their two to three month occupation of large parts of NEFA to demonstrate their goodwill to the people and to prove their superiority over the Indian state. Guyot-R√©chard argues that ‚Äúarguably, the PRC‚Äôs demonstration of invincibility, impeccable efficiency and self-sufficiency had been too convincing.‚Äù

The book also brings a fresh perspective to China‚Äôs military victory in 1962, which Guyot-R√©chard says could well turn out to be Pyrrhic. She argues that viewed solely in military terms or of control of territory, the victory was undeniably China‚Äôs. But why then, as John W. Garver points out, is this China‚Äôs ‚Äúforgotten war‚Äù? Is it because China‚Äôs leaders felt they miscalculated in launching it, and that it failed to resolve China‚Äôs coexistence with India or win over the populations of the eastern Himalaya? After the war, Tibetan resistance to Chinese rule continued, and NEFA‚Äôs people cooperated with returning Indian authorities. To that extent, the narrative of Chinese victory loses its shine, she points out. My own sense is that the war was at least as much an internal political coup by Mao, which succeeded, but which can hardly be acknowledged. It is probably a combination of several of these factors that explains the Chinese treatment of 1962 as the ‚Äòforgotten war‚Äô.

As China seeks to extend her strategic frontiers in several directions including the eastern Himalaya, and India seeks to maintain the natural geographic boundaries that have served her through history, this is a timely and useful book. It is also a useful reminder of the relatively recent and fragile nature of state formation in the eastern Himalaya. Internal party-political games in the Northeast, toppling governments and stretching the law beyond its capacity, and failure to meet minimum standards of governance only lays in store trouble in a situation of weak and fragile state structures and fundamental social change in our Himalayan borderland. When China is increasingly active at our periphery, when she hosts insurgent leaders from the Northeast India like Paresh Baruah, and reactivates Indian insurgent groups, it is useful to remember that this has been an arena of India-China competition for over a century, where the two countries have shadowed each other, where new states and aggressive nationalisms are yet to find equipoise, and where development has proved its worth as an instrument in the past.

We need more work like this which takes us away from the monochromatic state and sovereignty-centred view of our borders to a fuller understanding of our own past that includes the agency of the people and that show us the complexity of what we have inherited. In that complexity itself lies opportunity for the pragmatic policymaker, for the historian and for those who are prisoners of our present constricted narrative on China, our borders and the history we share. Like a true work of history, it will have served a useful purpose if it brings us to question conventional wisdom, widens our vision, and provokes more scholarship on its themes, and on the domestic and internal political dynamics that drive India and China to do what they do. Do read this book. It is of value well beyond the limited circle of academic readers that the title might attract.

Watford lose in EFL Cup to second tier Bristol City,"Bristol City scored their third and the eventual winner courtesy Niclas Eliasson. (Source: Reuters) Bristol City scored their third and the eventual winner courtesy Niclas Eliasson. (Source: Reuters)

Marco Silva‚Äôs promising start as Watford manager came to a halt when the Premier League team was knocked out of the League Cup by second-tier side Bristol City on Tuesday.

The southwest England side fought back to win 3-2 despite making nine changes for the trip to Vicarage Road, with City‚Äôs priority being to gain promotion from the League Championship.

‚ÄúBad night,‚Äù said Silva, who left Hull for Watford in the offseason. ‚ÄúA really bad result for us, a disappointing result.‚Äù

Watford has opened the Premier League season with a draw against Liverpool and victory over Bournemouth. But it was the only Premier League casualty on Tuesday night with the other six top-flight teams in action advancing from the second round against opponents from lower divisions.

Leicester won 4-1 at Sheffield United, West Bromwich Albion ousted Accrington Stanley 3-1, Swansea beat Milton Keynes Dons 4-1, Crystal Palace eliminated Ipswich 2-1, Bournemouth defeated Birmingham 2-1 and Brighton edged Barnet 1-0.

At Watford, Etienne Capoue put the hosts ahead early in the second half, only for 18-year-old Freddie Hinds to draw City level and Bobby Reid to put the visitors in front.

Watford‚Äôs night took a further turn for the worse when defender Jose Holebas was shown a second yellow card in the 88th minute and Niclas Eliasson then extended Bristol City‚Äôs lead. Adrian Mariappa‚Äôs header reduced the deficit deep into injury time but Watford ran out of time to produce an equalizer.

‚ÄúIn the first half we controlled the match but we played very slow,‚Äù Silva said. ‚ÄúVery, very slow, too slow all the first half. We controlled the match, we don‚Äôt give a lot of solutions for our opponents to make problems for us but we need to do something different in our fast decisions, in our counter attack as well, to create more chances to finish.‚Äù

Another six Premier League teams are in action on Wednesday in English football‚Äôs second-tier knockout competition and they are all playing teams from other divisions. Top-flight teams involved in European competitions don‚Äôt enter until the third round.

The draw is being held on Thursday in the Chinese capital Beijing, as competition organizers seek to attract commercial backing and new fans in Asia.

After protesting at Jantar Mantar for six days, 1,600 workers of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), including 25 labour contractors, ‚Äútemporarily called off the dharna‚Äù on Wednesday.

Lebanon says it helped foil plot to down plane in Australia,"Representational Image Representational Image

Lebanon‚Äôs interior minister said that the country‚Äôs police intelligence played a major role in foiling a plot to bring down an Emirati passenger plane that was supposed to take off from Sydney bound for the United Arab Emirates‚Äô capital, Abu Dhabi.

Nohad Machnouk told reporters on Monday that four Lebanese-Australian brothers, including one who is in detention in Lebanon, had planned to blow up the plane with bombs hidden inside a large Barbie doll and a meat grinder. He said the bombs did not make it onto the plane because the handbag they were placed in was 7 kilograms (15.4 pounds) above the weight permitted by the airline. Machnouk said the bombs were sent back to the would-be attacker‚Äôs home in Australia.

He said the attacker tried to bring two explosives on the plane in case one of them did not work. The second would be detonated by one of the brothers who was supposed to be the suicide attacker. It was not immediately clear how authorities uncovered the plot.

Australian authorities said late last month that they thwarted a credible terrorist plot to down an airplane by smuggling a device onboard. They have provided few details, including the precise nature of the threat or any airlines involved.

The United Arab Emirates‚Äô national airline said it is working with Australian police in the ongoing investigation. But Etihad Airways, the smallest of three long-haul Gulf carriers that fly to Australia, refused to confirm if it had been targeted.

Earlier this month, Australian police said two men were charged with terrorism offenses in Australia in connection with an alleged plot to bring down the airplane. It was not immediately clear if they were two of the four brothers. Four Lebanese-Australian men had been arrested by police, who also reportedly seized a meat grinder that investigators thought may be the basis of a bomb. One of the four was released later without charge.

Machnouk said two of the brothers, Khaled and Mahmoud Khayyat, are held in Australia, while another, Tarek, is a senior member of the Islamic State group based in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa. He added that the fourth brother, Amer, was supposed to be on board the plane, working to bring it down 20 minutes after takeoff, but was arrested in Lebanon after he arrived in mid-July from Australia. ‚ÄúThe operation was foiled because of the extra weight,‚Äù Machnouk said. ‚ÄúIntelligence branch followed on the case and found that Amer was involved in this act and it appears that he was supposed to carry it out.‚Äù

He said that since Tarek Khayyat moved to Raqqa and became in IS commander, Lebanese police intelligence started tracking his brothers. Machnouk said that Amer Khayyat traveled between Australia and Lebanon several times under pretexts such as coming to get engaged or get married. Machnouk said that about 400 passengers were on the plane, including 120 Lebanese. He said the four brothers wanted to punish the UAE and Australia for being part of the US-led coalition that is targeting the extremists.

‚ÄúWhen four Lebanese brothers in Australia decide to blow up an Emirati jet this means that the whole world should work together to fight terrorism,‚Äù Machnouk said. ‚ÄúCoordination should be 24 hours a day between all security agencies to stop such attacks.‚Äù

"Virender Sehwag, Mohammed Kaif call for accountability after train derailments","Utkal Express derailment left more than 20 people dead. Utkal Express derailment left more than 20 people dead.

Within a span of four days, two trains have derailed on India‚Äôs massive railway network which has claimed lives of over 20 people and left over a hundred passengers injured. Following these accidents, former cricketers have called for some accountability from the government and the ministers over the hapless response to the crisis.

One of the best opening batsmen India produced, Virender Sehwag wrote on his Twitter account, ‚ÄúBeing on time was difficult enough,now trains struggling even to be on track.No accountability.Wish human lives valued more,‚Äù. While Mohammed Kaif condemned the lives lost with the cavalier attitude, ‚Äú2 train derailments within a week.There has to be an accountability.‚ÄùChalta hai‚Äù attitude isappointing.Innocent lives lost,‚Äù he wrote.

"Ram Rahim rape case: Why a court verdict has Punjab, Haryana on tenterhooks","Ram Rahim rape case: Police preparations at Sirsa ahead of the verdict in the case of Dera Sacha Sauda head. (Source: Express Photo) Ram Rahim rape case: Police preparations at Sirsa ahead of the verdict in the case of Dera Sacha Sauda head. (Source: Express Photo)

What is the alleged Sadhvi rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh?

In 2002, a Dera Sacha Sauda sadhvi sent an anonymous letter to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee accusing Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh of raping her and other sadhvis. She accused the Dera chief of warning her not to talk about the incident, boasting of the clout he had with politicians in Punjab and Haryana. Taking suo motu cognizance of the letter, Punjab and Haryana High Court referred the matter to CBI for an inquiry on September 24, 2002.

CBI questioned 18 sadhvis who had left the Dera, some of whom told investigators that the Dera chief and his followers were ‚Äúvery dangerous people‚Äù. Two of the women accused the Dera chief of rape. One of them said she had been raped in order that she may be ‚Äúpurified‚Äù. CBI filed a chargesheet on July 30, 2007. A special CBI court in Panchkula will pronounce its verdict in the case on August 25.

The Dera chief is also an accused in the murders of Dera follower Ranjit Singh (whose family alleges that he was killed on suspicion of involvement in the anonymous sadhvi‚Äôs letter) and journalist Ram Chander Chattrapati (who wrote extensively on ‚Äúillegal activities‚Äù in the Dera). Ranjit was murdered on July 10, 2002; Chattrapati, who was shot at on October 23, 2002, died in hospital after about a month. Ram Rahim verdict: Sale of petrol in bottles, cans banned in parts of Punjab. Read.

Why are Punjab and Haryana tense?

Both states, in which a large number of Dera followers reside, fear largescale violence if the verdict goes against the Dera chief. Dera followers, who are called ‚Äúpremis‚Äù, have already gathered in their thousands in Panchkula, at the headquarters of the sect in Sirsa, and at its deras in Punjab and Haryana to express solidarity with Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in case of a conviction. The Dera has a massive base of followers across Punjab, Haryana and other states, most of whom are Dalits. The Dera‚Äôs official website boasts of 60 million ‚Äúfaithful followers‚Äù around the world. Punjab has an additional reason to worry because it has been witness to bloody clashes between Sikhs and Dera followers earlier. Punjab fears a face-off irrespective of which side finds the reason to celebrate.

What is the history of the standoff between Sikhs and Dera Sacha Sauda?

Sikh institutions nurse a grouse against the Dera for weaning away a section of Sikhs. The Dera draws its support from Dalit Sikhs who feel discriminated against by upper-caste Sikhs. The Dera has repeatedly used its followers‚Äô base to wield political influence. Following a massive clash between Sikhs and Dera followers in May 2007 after the Dera chief allegedly imitated Guru Gobind Singh, the Dera accused the then ruling Shiromani Akali Dal, which also controlled the Akal Takht and SGPC, of targeting its followers because the Dera had supported the Congress in the elections.

How have political parties reacted to the build-up of tension?

The Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab, as well as parties in Haryana, have banked on the Dera for political support that is often seen as having the ability to tilt the scales in one or the other direction. In the February 4 elections this year, the Dera supported SAD nominees in Malwa. It did not swing the SAD‚Äôs fortunes, but it did damage the prospects of the Aam Aadmi Party to a significant extent. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has declared that his government would deal with any law and order problem with an iron hand. The BJP government in Haryana has not so far held any talks with the Dera to defuse a potential conflagration. The Dera had supported the BJP in the 2014 Assembly elections.

Kimi Raikkonen contract came as no surprise to Sergio Perez,"Ferrari‚Äôs decision to retain 2007 world champion Raikkonen, who will be 38 in October, for one more season gives the team breathing space until other top drivers become available at the end of next year. (Source: AP) Ferrari‚Äôs decision to retain 2007 world champion Raikkonen, who will be 38 in October, for one more season gives the team breathing space until other top drivers become available at the end of next year. (Source: AP)

Ferrari‚Äôs decision to retain Kimi Raikkonen for 2018 came as no surprise to Mexican Sergio Perez, whose hopes of one day joining the Italian team appear to be fading fast.

‚ÄúI was expecting it,‚Äù the Force India driver, still in negotiations with his team about next year, told reporters at the Belgian Grand Prix when asked about Ferrari‚Äôs announcement earlier in the week.

Perez, a former Ferrari academy driver, has made no secret of his desire to join a top team.

A move to the Italian outfit would be a dream scenario for Mexican Grand Prix promoters, whose Formula One circuit is named after the late Ferrari drivers Pedro and Ricardo Rodriguez.

The 27-year-old, who had a difficult season with McLaren in 2013, has had seven career podium finishes but remains surprisingly under-rated.

Ferrari‚Äôs decision to retain 2007 world champion Raikkonen, who will be 38 in October, for one more season gives the team breathing space until other top drivers become available at the end of next year.

Four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel also looks sure to stay after his contract expires this year, but that has yet to be confirmed.

Perez said he expected his own situation to be resolved soon, with his personal sponsors also involved.

‚ÄúHopefully once we go into Asia, my future is secured. I‚Äôm in no hurry, I know that I am in a good position,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThere are a couple of options that we are analysing and trying to get the best one,‚Äù he added when asked whether he was looking long-term or for a one-year deal. The last European race of the season is in Italy on Sept. 3. Perez was also critical of the yawning gap between the best and the rest in Formula One.

‚ÄúWhat is frustrating for me is the way the sport is at the moment, with simply a team or two teams being able to compete for the top and then there is a big margin behind,‚Äù said the Mexican.

‚ÄúIf you are not in those two teams it is very difficult. Then you are in the same position as everyone else around you.‚Äù

Force India are currently fourth in the championship after 11 races, more than 200 points behind champions Mercedes and Ferrari.

India vs Sri Lanka: Angelo Mathews takes stunning catch to dismiss Shikhar Dhawan,"Angelo Mathews took a blinder to send Shikhar Dhawan back in the hut for 49. Angelo Mathews took a blinder to send Shikhar Dhawan back in the hut for 49.

Former Sri Lankan skipper Angelo Mathews displayed brilliant skills in the field to send Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan back in the pavilion. The left-handed batsman tried to sweep a delivery from Siriwardana over fine leg but failed to clear the 30-yard circle. Mathews who was standing at short-fine leg region ran to his left and grabbed a magnificent diving catch to dismiss the Indian batsman for 49.

Dhawan was the second batsman to be dismissed but a flurry of wickets after this reduced India to 131/7. Earlier, India were handed over a target of 231 runs in 47 overs after play was delayed due to rain before the start India‚Äôs chase. While chasing a modest target, India were cruising as the opening pair of Rohit Sharma and Shikhar gave them a solid start. The left-right duo compiled a total of 109 runs.

Sharma ended his run-drought in Sri Lanka as the right-hander went on to score a half-century.

But the real drama started when Akila Dananjaya was introduced in the attack. After scalping Sharma for 54, the spinner sent Kedar Jadhav, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul back in the hut in one single over. The leggie didn‚Äôt stop here as bagged the wicket of Hardik Pandya who danced down the track but missed the ball completely and was stumped by Dickwella.

Struggling at 131/7, the Men in Blue were provided with some resistance from their former captain MS Dhoni and tail-end batsman Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the middle.

India won the first match of the five-match ODI series in Dambulla.

A joint flag march of paramilitary forces and Chandigarh police personnel was held from Industrial Area, Phase-1 to Daria, adjoining Chandigarh railway station. Meanwhile, over 6,000 personnel were deployed throughout Chandigarh to maintain law and order in view of the upcoming verdict in a rape case against the Dera chief. All the 18 DSPs, along with 17 SHOs and six IPSs, including Punjab DGP Tajender Singh Luthra and DIG Dr OP Mishra, will remain on duty for the next two days.

In Panchkula, six companies of paramilitary force have already arrived on Monday. The steadily swelling numbers of Dera followers arriving in Panchkula are giving even the administration and police officers the jitters and has left residents wondering why the authorities took no steps to prevent the build-up over the last few days.

Haryana DGP BS Sandhu told Chandigarh Newsline that it had been impossible to prevent the followers from the gathering in Panchkula. The administration has imposed Section 144 CrPC, but, said the DGP, the orders are specific to the movement of weapons only and not on the assembly of people. ‚ÄúHow can we stop 1.5 lakh people from entering Panchkula? It is a district which doesn‚Äôt have one or two entry routes but multiple routes. They are entering Panchkula from Chandigarh, Punjab side and other areas,‚Äù said Sandhu.

Adding to the fears is the fact that the Dera followers, who had congregated at Sector 23 Naam Charcha Ghar through Tuesday, their numbers, building up to 50,000 by late last night, had all dispersed to various other locations in Panchkula overnight, evidently to pre-empt the police from coralling them all at one place and prevent them from moving out of there.

The followers are now scattered in internal sectors, parks and green belts of the city. Asked if the police could not have prevented such a large number from moving out of Sector 23, Sandhu said, ‚ÄúI agree it would have been easy to control at one place. Lekin hum zor zabardasti nahi kar sakte the‚Ä¶ lathi charge kaise karden‚Ä¶chhote chhote bachhen hai‚Ä¶. The fact is that our court complex is totally safe.‚Äù

But, the residents are panicking as Dera followers spread out in the internal lanes of sectors and green belts in sectors 2,3,4,5, 6,7,8. The residents welfare associations have decided to keep the security gates closed 24 hours or advance the closing timings. At Sector 6, which faces Sector 1, where the court complex is located, the RWA has ordered closure of gates throughout the day and night. ‚ÄúOnly one gate has been kept open and that, too, the security guard will check the entry of visitors. They have been alerted about the Dera followers,‚Äù said Jeevan Aggarwal, president of RWA, Sector 6.

Sector 7 RWA, too, has ordered the closure of all its 22 security gates, keeping open only one entry from the market side. S K Nayar, president of Citizens‚Äô Welfare Association, said, ‚ÄúThere is panic among the residents. As the followers have entered the residential area, there is fear that they might torch the vehicles or damage the property if the decision goes against them.‚Äù Assessing the movement of followers during the night, the Sector 8 RWA has ordered that all nine security gates be closed an hour before that is at 10 pm instead of 11 pm. The followers were seen sitting in Yavnika, Japanese garden and other green belts.

Traders mull keeping shops closed on judgment day

Fearing damage to shops on the lines of what happened during the Jat agitation, Panchkula Beopar Mandal has mulled keeping all shops closed on August 25. PBM President Kuldeep Chitkara said the traders were worried and a meeting of all presidents has been convened on Thursday to announce this decision. The followers are getting food supply from 40 places, including Rattewali, Bator, Barwala, Baltana and other areas in the region.

18 CCTV cameras installed on all routes leading to district court

The district police have installed additional 18 temporary CCTV cameras on all important routes leading to the district court complex. The cameras were attached to screens fitted at all nearby police stations. Sources said the decision was taken when it came to the light of senior officials that some of the CCTV cameras, installed long back, were not working properly. Sources said at a short notice, it was not possible to replace and rectify the dysfunctional cameras and officials preferred to install new cameras on temporary basis, which will be removed after the visit of the Dera head.

"Marcello Lippi to stay on until 2019 Asian Cup, says Chinese Football Association","China‚Äôs best performance in the Asian Cup came on home soil in 2004, when they lost to Japan in the final. (Source: File) China‚Äôs best performance in the Asian Cup came on home soil in 2004, when they lost to Japan in the final. (Source: File)

Marcello Lippi will remain as China coach until at least the 2019 Asian Cup finals, the Chinese Football Association said on Thursday.

The Italian, who replaced Gao Hongbo last October, has kept China‚Äôs slim hopes of qualifying for the next year‚Äôs World Cup finals alive since taking over.

China take on Uzbekistan and Qatar in their final two qualifiers over the coming weeks, with Lippi‚Äôs team needing to win both and hope other results go their way to have any hope of progressing into the playoffs for a place in Russia.

‚ÄúWe will strictly carry out our contract with Lippi, which expires after the 2019 Asian Cup,‚Äù the CFA said in an article posted on their website on Thursday.

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt interfere with his preparation and the line-up. In the meantime, we will support his group as always. We hope to support and trust each other.‚Äù

By progressing to the final round of Asia‚Äôs World Cup qualifiers, the Chinese have already secured their place at the quadrennial Asian Cup, which has been expanded to feature 24 teams for the first time in the United Arab Emirates in 2019.

China‚Äôs best performance in the Asian Cup came on home soil in 2004, when they lost to Japan in the final. They reached the quarter-finals in the most recent edition, in Australia in 2015.

The team have shown some progress under Lippi, securing only their second win over South Korea in March, but their hopes of qualifying for a second World Cup finals were always remote after a poor start under Gao.

‚ÄúSince October 22 last year, Lippi and his coaching staff have helped China to get one win, two draws and one defeat in the qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup,‚Äù said the CFA.

‚ÄúThe team has changed a lot tactically and mentally. We hereby take this opportunity to thank them all.‚Äù

Constantine‚Äôs men look to make it 10 wins in a row,"Stephen Constantine Stephen Constantine

In their final preparatory match before next month‚Äôs Asian Cup qualifier against Macau, India will take on Caribbean side St. Kitts and Nevis, who are ranked 125th in the world. India coach Stephen Constantine is expected to give a few more young players an opportunity before finalising his squad for the Macau match, which will be played on September 5.

On a nine-match unbeaten run, India defeated Mauritius 2-1 in the opening match of the tri-series here, a match in which forwards Robin Singh and Balwant Singh scored a goal each. Coach Constantine handed debuts to Balwant, goalkeeper Amrinder Singh, Nikhil Pujary and Manvir Singh in that game and is expected to continue his policy on Thursday as well.

The Indian defence comprising the likes of Sandesh Jhinghan, would play a crucial role in the absence of first-choice goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, who will join the team later this month along with Sunil Chhetri. The duo is currently in Bengaluru, discharging their club duties.

‚ÄúWe have tendency to start slow and that sometimes causes problem as it did with Mauritius. They got the first goal, even Puerto Rico (in an international friendly last year) got the first goal. We need to come out little bit quicker, that is one of the key areas. Defence is obviously is one of the key areas,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSt. Kitts and Nevis did a good job in containing Mauritius. They (St. Kitts and Nevis) are quite dangerous especially on the counter attack and you could see in the goal against Mauritius),‚Äù he said.

St Kitts and Nevis, who were held by a lower-ranked Mauritius to a 1-1 draw, would like to put up an inspired show against the favourites. Their coach Jacques Passy also conceded that India are a formidable side compared to them despite the absence of several first-team players. ‚ÄúThey (India) are absolute favourites to win the tournament. It is no more a three-nation, but a two-nation tournament. Our focus is on India,‚Äù Passy said.

Tales From the Coal Crypt,"Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973.

Let me start with the positives. Subhomoy Bhattacharjee‚Äôs book on India‚Äôs coal story has all the facts that a person might want to know about this industry. And I truly mean it ‚Äî from July 1836 when, through Carr, Tagore and Company, Dwarkanath Tagore (Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs grandfather), bought out a Raniganj mine in the district of Burdwan some 130 miles northwest of Kolkata, the nationwide scandal on coal block allocations triggered by the Comptroller and Auditor General‚Äôs report of August 2012 to Naveen Jindal‚Äôs foray into tapping the coal deposits of Mozambique. It is replete with information, hard facts, interviews and extremely plausible conjectures which makes the book an essential reference kit for anyone interested in this complex and messy industry.

Arranged across nine chapters, the book begins with coal in the colonial era right up to the late 1960s, and then moves on to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act of 1973. This was a cornerstone of Indira Gandhi‚Äôs nationalisation-driven socialist rule after the Bangladesh war and the bill was enthusiastically piloted by Mohan Kumaramangalam, a sophisticated and erudite trade union leader, an ex-Communist Party of India cadre and her minister for coal and mines. Describing the private sector mines as relics of the Middle Ages and instruments of human oppression, Kumaramangalam argued that if nationalisation was postponed by another 25 years, there would be little or no coal left for the country, barring uneconomical, hazardous units, underground fires and poorly paid workers. Coal nationalisation was Mohan Kumaramangalam‚Äôs last hurrah. Very soon afterwards, he was one of the 48 who died in a terrible Indian Airlines crash on 31 May 1973.

The next chapter, ‚ÄòCoal on Sale‚Äô, looks at the large scale illegal theft in the mining and sale of coal in the decade or so that followed nationalisation ‚Äî the stuff that made multi-millionaires of thugs led by the infamous four-term MLA Surya Deo Singh who became the legend and godfather of Dhanbad, as well as others such as Babloo Srivastava, Brijesh Singh, Hari Shankar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi. A part of every transaction in the nationalised mines from recruitment to sales and transport had to be paid to these goons; nothing could work without their say-so and their cuts. Bhattacharjee then uses the theme of ‚Äòcoal on sale‚Äô to transit from small to very large sales via Manoj Jayaswal, a hitherto unknown cricket-loving businessman from Nagpur and his application for a large coal block in Chhattisgarh; to be followed by Naveen Jindal and Sandeep Jajodia of Monnet Ispat.

That sets the stage for Bhattacharjee‚Äôs next chapter entitled, self-evidently, as ‚ÄòNotes from an Auditor‚Äô. It covers the famous CAG report under Vinod Rai‚Äôs tenure and goes into the entire coal mine leasing scam in great detail ‚Äî including the irreparable political damage it caused prime minister Manmohan Singh, the intervention of the Supreme Court which nullified almost all hitherto held coal block auctions, and the travails of the coal secretary PC Parakh and his successor Harish Chandra Gupta. To my mind, it is the best chapter of the book.

After that, the book meanders over the next four chapters. To be sure, it looks into some key issues such as environmental brakes and the part that Jairam Ramesh played as the minister for environment and forests; the role of entrepreneurs; the cost of the failure of coal block auctions to the banking system, especially those that had large exposures in coal based power plants and associated mining rights; a foray into international acquisitions, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa; and on India‚Äôs energy ambitions. Each chapter has considerable information. However, these somehow do not hold together as part of a continuous book.

Which brings me to my basic criticism. Here is a book that has enough material to have become a classic on the subject. Yet, it begs a coherence of purpose and narrative that such a book demands. It is as if there are many informative journalistic copies, each structured in 600-word formats, but few flowing from one to the other, to create tightly knit chapters leading to an ‚Äòun-put-down-able‚Äô book. Unlike, for instance, the books of fellow journalists such as Andrew Ross Sorkin‚Äôs Too Big to Fail, William D. Cohen‚Äôs Money and Power, any of David Halberstam‚Äôs works and, nearer home, some of Arun Shourie‚Äôs books or TN Ninan‚Äôs Turn of the Tortoise, Bhattacharjee does not tie together the many fascinating micro-pieces into the structure of a consistently well reading book. Perhaps it reflects the absence of the publishing editor, who ought to have helped in this task. Also, there are some serious editorial shortfalls, the most obvious one being that, despite having a 14-page bibliography printed in a tiny font-size, there is not a single footnote or endnote in the text to correlate these with the references.

There are so many informative nuggets in this work which, if fused well, ought to have made for a great book. It is, no doubt, a sound reference guide. But it could have been so much more. And that‚Äôs the pity.

Hardik Pandya needs to work more on his ODI bowling skills: Bharat Arun,"Hardik Pandya has been improving steadily over the past year. (Source: AP) Hardik Pandya has been improving steadily over the past year. (Source: AP)

Indian all-rounder, Hardik Pandya has been delivering a string of good performances consistently which has led to his consistent improvement. With his recent performances in the Test series against Sri Lanka, Pandya grabbed the eyeballs and drew a lot of applause. Skipper Virat Kohli even went on to the extent of saying that Hardik Pandya can be to India what Ben Stokes is to England. Now team India‚Äôs bowling coach, Bharat Arun has said that Pandya is a work in progress and can be one of India‚Äôs frontline bowling options.

Speaking to cribuzz. com, Bharat Arun spoke about Pandya‚Äôs role in the side and said, ‚ÄúIf you look at Hardik, he works up very good speeds and bowls 135 plus consistently. We need to have our options open throughout so we like to try out different bowlers at different points of time.‚Äù

Stating that Pandya is looking to develop more skills to improve his bowling, he said, ‚ÄúMore than me I think Hardik wants to bowl those 10 overs and he does understand that to bowl those 10 overs he needs to work more on his skill and become more skillful. He is someone who works really hard and he is not afraid of trying different things. So my job is a lot easier to be working with somebody like Hardik who wants to upgrade on his skill.‚Äù

when asked if there was a valid time-frame by which he could improve his skill-set Arun added, ‚ÄúIf you ask me the time-frame, if I ask them to do something I would like to see them do it immediately. But each bowler takes a little while to be able to do that in a match. You need to put in some hours of practice and you need to perfect that in practice before you are able to put that skill in the match. Not only Hardik, it depends on what the bowler is capable of doing, not only their actions but what is easier for them to do. So it is my job to understand that and give them the right feedback.‚Äù

It may be recalled here that earlier, former Sri Lankan skipper, Mahela Jayawardene had also lauded Hardik Pandya for his performances and said, ‚ÄúHe is an amazing talent, especially for the shorter formats of the game. To have someone who can bowl between 130 -140kmph is a great addition to the side. You saw his batting skills as well. He has the temperament to go big when he needs to. At the same time, he can bat for time. It gives India a lot of options.‚Äù

Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather trade praise not profanities,"Conor McGregor could not hold his tongue but saved his venom for a member of Floyd Mayweather‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoney Team‚Äù. (Source: Reuters) Conor McGregor could not hold his tongue but saved his venom for a member of Floyd Mayweather‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoney Team‚Äù. (Source: Reuters)

Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather Jr. declared a truce on Wednesday after weeks of vicious verbal attacks, offering praise instead of profanities at the final press conference ahead of their much anticipated fight.

Since the fight between undefeated boxer Mayweather and mixed martial arts champion McGregor was announced in June, the two men took part in a profanity laced world tour to hype a bout that has been met with both skepticism and excitement.

The final press conference ahead of Saturday‚Äôs fight, however, was closer to a love-in than a battle field with Mayweather, in particular, complimenting the man who has questioned everything from his manhood to his fashion sense.

‚ÄúConor McGregor had a hell of a career, he‚Äôs still got a hell of a career,‚Äù said Mayweather. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a hell of a fighter, he‚Äôs a stand up guy, a tough competitor.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be an easy fight. There will be blood sweat and tears Saturday.‚Äù McGregor was far less effusive in his compliments but after months of mercilessly attacking Mayweather said he welcomed the pause in hostilities.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of crazy press conferences, this is a lot more subdued, a lot more business like the way I like it ‚Ä¶ sometimes,‚Äù said McGregor.

After the two had turned the air blue with profanity during the earlier media tour, Mayweather went the entire press conference on Wednesday without swearing.

McGregor could not hold his tongue but saved his venom for a member of Mayweather‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoney Team‚Äù who taunted him from the audience, telling him he was going to be knocked out.

‚ÄúNot by you, whoever you are,‚Äù countered McGregor. ‚ÄúTell that bitch to shut up,‚Äù the Irishman growled while looking at Mayweather, who later chastised the member of his team.

The restrained tone of Wednesday‚Äôs media conference underscored the high stakes of what is expected to be the richest fight in boxing with McGregor in line for $100 million payday and Mayweather as much as $200 million.

While boxing purists and pundits have denounced the fight as nothing more than a laughable cash grab it has nonetheless captured the fascination of fans.

Showtime executive Stephen Espinoza said the fight, which will be distributed in more than 200 countries, is on pace to smash pay per view records. While the fiery rhetoric was toned down, both remain confident of the outcome.

‚ÄúI will go forward, I will put the pressure on him and break this old man,‚Äù said McGregor, who said he expected to end the 12-round bout inside two rounds. ‚ÄúTrust me on that. I am going to out box this man at his own game.‚Äù

The only message Mayweather had for McGregor was his record reminding him that he was trying to do something that no one has ever been able to do; beat him.

‚ÄúI know one thing I can do I can fight,‚Äù said Mayweather. ‚ÄúI can give it and I can take it, but for me to be 49-0 it is obvious I have been giving it and not receiving it.

‚ÄúAnything and everything in boxing that can be done, I‚Äôve done it. I was born a fighter, I will die a fighter.‚Äù

"Ram Rahim verdict: Sale of petrol in bottles, cans banned in parts of Punjab","Gurmeet Ram Rahim Gurmeet Ram Rahim

Ahead of the Panchkula court verdict in a sexual exploitation case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh on August 25, sale of petrol in bottles or any container from petrol pumps as well as sale of acid has been banned in several districts of Punjab, including Bathinda, Muktsar, Faridkot, Ferozepur, Fazilka and Sangrur, till August 31.

Bathinda deputy collector Diparva Lakra has also asked bus operators to keep buses off roads after 2 pm on August 25, when the verdict is expected. Earlier, intelligence reports had indicated that dera followers have stored petrol, sharp-eged weapons and stones in Nam Charcha Ghars (Dera Sacha Sauda‚Äôs centres) in Faridkot.

Lakra said orders had been issued to maintain law and order. Faridkot DC Rajiv Prashar said police had been deployed outside the Nam Charcha Ghars in the district, though the situation was normal. He said arms dealers had been asked to shut shop till August 31.

There were reports of people in panic storing ration and vegetables for a week. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs scary to see armed police on roads everywhere. I have no choice but to hoard essentials for at least a week. Bathinda witnessed violence in 2007 when clashes took places between dera followers and Sikhs,‚Äù said a resident of Maur Mandi in Bathinda.

Amarvir Singh, president of Wholesale Vegetable and Fruits Dealers of Punjab, said, ‚ÄúWe are getting normal supplies and are likely to get in future as well. Only the August 25 verdict will indicate what happens next. Till then, there is no need to panic.‚Äù

Meanwhile, State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT) has postponed exams and counselling to be held on August 25 and 26 for diploma in elementary education course. The next date will be announced shortly, says an SCERT circular released by Director Sukhdev Singh Kahlon.

North Korea fires up rocket production programme amid signs of drama easing,"The last missile test on July 28 put the US mainland in range, prompting heated exchanges that raised fears of a new conflict on the peninsula. (File) The last missile test on July 28 put the US mainland in range, prompting heated exchanges that raised fears of a new conflict on the peninsula. (File)

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered the production of more solid-fuel rocket engines, state media said on Wednesday, as he pursues nuclear and missile programmes amid a standoff with Washington, but there were signs of the drama easing.

The report carried by the KCNA news agency lacked the traditionally robust threats against the United States after weeks of heightened tension, and US President Donald Trump expressed optimism about a possible improvement in relations. ‚ÄúI respect the fact that he is starting to respect us,‚Äù Trump said of Kim at a raucous campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona.

‚ÄúAnd maybe ‚Äì probably not, but maybe ‚Äì something positive can come about,‚Äù he said.

The KCNA report, about Kim‚Äôs visit to a chemical institute, came not long after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to make a peace overture, welcoming what he called the recent restraint shown by the reclusive North.

Kim was briefed about the process of manufacturing intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) warhead tips and solid-fuel rocket engines during his tour of the Chemical Material Institute of the Academy of Defence Science, KCNA said. ‚ÄúHe instructed the institute to produce more solid-fuel rocket engines and rocket warhead tips by further expanding engine production process and the production capacity of rocket warhead tips and engine jets by carbon/carbon compound material,‚Äù KCNA said.

North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and dozens of missile tests since the start of last year, significantly raising tensions on the heavily militarised Korean peninsula and in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. Two ICBM tests in July resulted in a new round of tougher global sanctions.

The last missile test on July 28 put the US mainland in range, prompting heated exchanges that raised fears of a new conflict on the peninsula.

Tillerson, however, noted what he called the restraint the North had shown and said on Tuesday he hoped a path could be opening for dialogue.

SIMULATED WAR DRILLS

South Korea and the United States are conducting an annual joint drill this week involving computer simulations of a possible war, exercises that the North routinely describes as preparation for invasion. The drills started on Monday and run through to Aug. 31.

The KCNA report said Kim had given ‚Äúspecial thanks and special bonus‚Äù to officials of the institute, calling them heroes. A photograph showed Kim in a grey pinstriped suit, smiling before a large flow chart that described some kind of manufacturing process.

There was none of the fiery rhetoric of recent weeks, when Kim threatened to fire missiles into the sea near the US Pacific territory of Guam after Trump warned North Korea it would face ‚Äúfire and fury‚Äù if it threatened the United States.

But there were some signs of tension after the United States imposed new North Korea-related sanctions, targeting Chinese and Russian firms and individuals for supporting North Korea‚Äôs weapons programmes.

The US Treasury designated six Chinese-owned entities, one Russian, one North Korean and two based in Singapore. They included a Namibia-based subsidiary of a Chinese company and a North Korean entity operating in Namibia.

China reacted with irritation, saying Washington should ‚Äúimmediately correct its mistake‚Äù of imposing unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals.

The United States has long urged China to do more to rein in North Korea, which counts Beijing as its lone major ally. Data released on Wednesday showed China‚Äôs trade with North Korea fell in July from a month earlier as a ban on coal purchases from its isolated neighbour slowed imports.

The United States is technically still at war with the North because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North routinely says it will never give up its weapons programmes, saying they are necessary to counter perceived US hostility.

"Pro Kabaddi 2017: UP Yoddha taste first home win, edge past Telugu Titans","UP Yoddha registered their first win at home. (Source: AP) UP Yoddha registered their first win at home. (Source: AP)

The home crowd finally had something to cheer about as UP Yoddha registered their first win at home. UP Yoddha concluded their home leg with a 25-23 win over Telugu Titans. After four consecutive defeats and a tie against Tamil Thalaivas, the Nitin Tomar-led side held their nerves in the dying moments to win five points.

However, it was another night to remember for Titans captain Rahul Chaudhari as he became the first player to score 600 points. But for the poster boy of PKL, his recent feat could have been sweet if his side had managed to trounce the hosts side. ‚ÄúIt could have been better if we had won the match. Otherwise personal accolades do not matter to me,‚Äù Rahul said.

Both the teams started the game with two empty raids each followed by unsuccessful raids by their raiders. While Titans took the lead reaching 12-10 at half time, the Yoddhas came back strongly to level the scores 20-20. The drama continued with Rahul scoring two raid points to equalise at 22-22.

With five minutes remaining, Telugu Titans bounced back in style, credit to successful raids from Nilesh Salunke and Vinoth Kumar. In the remaining time, the game turned into Titans favour before Nitin Tomar side extended their lead with Rahul Chaudhari‚Äôs unsuccessful raid.

But unlike the previous five matches, Nitin kept calm as the team didn‚Äôt stumble in the last minutes to give the home crowd a sigh of relief. As UP ended their home leg with a win, they now strengthened their lead in Zone B points table.

Manchester United re-sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a one-year deal,"Manchester United have re-signed Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a one-year deal. (Source: Club website) Manchester United have re-signed Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a one-year deal. (Source: Club website)

Manchester United have resigned Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a one-year deal and the striker is set to wear the No. 10 jersey for the Red Devils. The official website of the United made the announcement on Thursday and said that he will be wearing the No.10 jersey for the Old Trafford side.

‚ÄúManchester United is delighted to announce that Zlatan Ibrahimovic will continue his journey with the club and has signed a one-year contract. He will wear the number 10 shirt,‚Äù said the club website.

Manager Jose Mourinho said, ‚ÄúWe are delighted Zlatan is on the road to recovery and we are equally delighted to have his ambition and experience back with us. After his contribution last season he deserves our trust and we will be patient waiting for him to return. I have no doubt that he will be important in the second part of the season.‚Äù

Ibrahimovic said: ‚ÄúI am back to finish what I started. It was always mine and the club‚Äôs intention for me to stay. I cannot wait to get back out on that Old Trafford pitch, but I also know that I have to take my time to make sure that I am ready. I have been working hard and will continue to do so to make sure I am in the best possible condition for my return to the pitch.‚Äù

The reports of the 35-year old joining United had started spreading earlier this week as Mourinho reinstated that they want the Swede back in their team, despite his knee ligament injury. The development has taken place owing to the his quick recovery from knee ligament injury.

Ibrahimovic was the highest goal scorer for United last season, despite making few appearances in the later half of the season. He scored 17 times in 27 Premier League starts, racking up 28 goals overall. His score was followed by Marcus Rashford and Henrikh Mkhitaryan at 11 each.

Ava Keishing,"Ava‚Äôs political career began in the 1950s, when he was elected as an MP from Outer Manipur constituency in the first general election (Archive) Ava‚Äôs political career began in the 1950s, when he was elected as an MP from Outer Manipur constituency in the first general election (Archive)

They called him Ava, father. Rishang Keishing, who died on Tuesday in Imphal, was a father figure not just to the Tangkhul Nagas of Ukhrul, where he was born in 1920, but to entire Manipur, the state he served as chief minister four times. His political career began in the 1950s, when he was elected as an MP from Outer Manipur constituency in the first general election. He retired from active politics at the age of 94 in 2014, when his Rajya Sabha term ended.

Keishing started his political career in the Socialist Party and was one of the 12 party MPs in the first Lok Sabha. It is said his close friend, the legendary Assamese writer, Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya, who was a follower of Rammanohar Lohia, influenced Keishing to join the socialists. In fact, Bhattacharya‚Äôs celebrated novel, Yaruingam, is also a life-story of Keishing. In the post-Independence years, when the nationalities in the North-east were in a ferment, Keishing was the self-made Naga who believed in the promise of a secular, federal India that could accommodate its peripheries.

Bhattacharya‚Äôs novel looks closely at the parallel political streams that were emerging in the eastern hills of Assam, one that stressed on ethnic identities and differences and led to an armed separatist movement and the other that sought to build a politics around the idea of love and tolerance preached by the missionaries and Mahatma Gandhi.

Keishing represented the second strand. In a region where tribal identities mark political cleavages, Keishing was successful in carving a profile that rose above regional and ethnic identities. In the early 1960s, as the socialist movement disintegrated, he joined Nehru‚Äôs Congress.

For many years, Keishing was the political face of the Indian state as it fought the Naga insurgency, led mainly by another Tangkhul Naga, Thuingaleng Muivah. In a region where fidelity to party and ideology is fickle and negotiable, Keishing was exceptional in staying with the Congress. The steadfastness earned him respect from even his political opponents.

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena sacks justice minister for criticising Hambantota port deal with China,"Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena. (Source: PTI) Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena. (Source: PTI)

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday sacked his outspoken justice minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe for criticising the government‚Äôs USD 1.1 billion deal with China to develop the strategic Hambantota port. Sirisena removed Rajapakshe following a request from the United National Party (UNP) to dismiss the minister who had publicly denounced the government‚Äôs July 29 decision to sell a 70-per cent stake in the port to a state-run Chinese firm, a move that could raise security concerns in India.

UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim said that Rajapakshe was given a deadline till Monday by the UNP leadership to rectify his critical statement.

However, Rajapakshe had failed to do so and as a result the party has now decided he must be removed from his cabinet post, Hashim was quoted as saying by the Colombo Gazette.

Hashim also said that Rajapakshe continued to make critical statements against the UNP and the government‚Äôs decisions.

Rajapakshe was quoted as saying that the port deal was a betrayal of the country‚Äôs sovereignty and he would make sure that the port is taken back from China.

Under the 99-year lease agreement, China‚Äôs state-run conglomerate China Merchant Port Holdings is to invest up to USD 1.1 billion in the port and marine-related activities.

The accumulated loss from the port was more than USD 300 million and the money realised from deal will set off the debts owed to China, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had said.

Rajapakshe, who is also the minister in charge of the Buddhist order, was previously accused of aiding and abetting an extremist Buddhist monk who was promoting violence against the Muslim minority.

The UNP has also charged that Rajapakshe as the Minister of Justice had hampered the investigations against the family of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose nearly a decade-long rule was ended by Sirisena in 2015.

The UNP said that investigations against former strongman Rajapaksa and his followers on alleged misdeeds had taken over two and a half years, and Rajapakshe was responsible for deliberate slowing down of investigations.

Rajapakshe denied the accusation, saying it was not proper for the government to interfere in the judiciary.

IIT Kharagpur whistleblower professor Rajeev Kumar reinstated at JNU,"An official order by JNU said that the professor will :‚Äùresume his duties in School of Computer and Systems Sciences immediately.‚Äù An official order by JNU said that the professor will :‚Äùresume his duties in School of Computer and Systems Sciences immediately.‚Äù

Jawaharlal Nehru University has allowed Rajeev Kumar, former professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Karagpur and whistleblower, to be reinstated. An official order by JNU said that he will :‚Äùresume his duties in School of Computer and Systems Sciences immediately.‚Äù

Former president Pranab Mukherjee had quashed the order for the professor‚Äôs compulsory retirement which was decided by IIT KGP in 2014, following which Kumar had approached the Delhi High Court alleging bias.

In May 2011, the Supreme Court had lauded Kumar as an ‚Äúunsung hero‚Äù for his contribution in the reform of the IIT Joint Entrance Exams (JEE) and the introduction of JEE Advanced. The same year, an IIT Kharagpur probe panel accused him of ‚Äúdamaging the reputation of the institute‚Äù for his allegations on various issues including students copying during examinations and irregular purchase of laptops.

The institute in 2014 decided to enforce compulsory retirement and Kumar appealed at the Delhi High Court and approached the President.

In 2015, he took a lien to work for two years at JNU and was later relieved from the varsity in order to re-join IIT Kharagpur. Last week, IIT accepted his resignation and he asked JNU vice chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar to be reinstated to his position in the School of Computer and Systems Sciences.

"Raksha Bandhan 2017: Know the Importance, History and Significance of Raksha Bandhan Festival in India","There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother‚Äôs wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia) There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother‚Äôs wrist. (Express photo by Sahil Walia)

India as we know has a rich cultural heritage and while there are many festivals observed throughout the year, Raksha Bandhan holds a special place. It is the time when siblings celebrate the special bond of love between them. Sisters tie a thread/band around their brother‚Äôs wrist for his long life and happiness and in exchange he promises to protect his sibling from all evils. This year, Raksha Bandhan will be observed on August 7.

Origin of Raksha Bandhan

The exact origin of the festival that is celebrated joyously in India and Nepal is unknown, but there are are many interesting stories associated with it. The most popular one is from the Mahabharata and it acknowledges the relationship between Lord Krishna and Draupadi. According to the epic, one morning, when Lord Krishna was flying a kite, he cut his finger on the abrasive string. Draupadi, who was nearby, saw him bleeding profusely and ran to him. She then tore a piece from her sari and tied it around his finger. Lord Krishna was so touched that in return he promised to protect her from all evil, forever. And he did protect her all along, especially during her ‚Äòcheerharan‚Äô by the Kauravas.

There‚Äôs another interesting story involving Emperor Humayun and Rani Karnavati of Mewar. When Mewar was attacked twice by Bahadur Shah Zafar in the mid 16th century, she sent a letter with a rakhi to Humayun as a last resort, to help her. The emperor was so touched by the gesture that he immediately left the military campaign he was then involved in to protect her.

Interesting rituals

There are many rites and rituals associated with Raksha Bandhan and some go beyond the more popular practice of tying rakhi around the brother‚Äôs wrist. In some parts of India, families draw figures and symbols on the walls of their homes and worship them with offerings of vermilion and kheer. Palm imprints are also used to decorate the entrance of a household where rakhis are stuck.

McCain (DDG 56) steers towards the Changi Naval Base, Singapore, following a collision with the merchant vessel Alnic MC while underway east of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. (Source ‚Äì AP photo)

U.S. Navy and Marine Corps divers on Tuesday found some remains of missing sailors inside sections of a U.S. guided-missile destroyer that collided with a merchant vessel near Singapore, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet said. The USS John S. McCain and the tanker Alnic MC collided on Monday while the U.S. ship was approaching Singapore on a routine port call. The impact tore a hole in the warship‚Äôs port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area.

U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Scott Swift said an international search-and-rescue operation had found some remains and that the wider search for 10 sailors missing from the accident would continue until all hope was exhausted. ‚ÄúThe divers were able to locate some remains in those sealed compartments during their search,‚Äù Swift told reporters at Singapore‚Äôs Changi Naval Base where the USS John S McCain is docked for damage assessment. ‚ÄúAdditionally, the Malaysian authorities have reported that they have located potential remains. They are working to confirm and identify those remains.‚Äù He did not specify how many remains had been found.

The Malaysian navy said in a statement it had found a body eight nautical miles northwest of the collision site and it would transfer it to the U.S. Navy on Wednesday. Swift also said Monday‚Äôs collision ‚Äì the fourth major accident in the U.S. Pacific fleet this year ‚Äì could not be viewed in isolation from other incidents and that investigations were seeking to find a ‚Äúcommon cause at the root of these events‚Äù.

The John S. McCain‚Äôs sister ship, the Fitzgerald, almost sank off the coast of Japan after colliding with a Philippine container ship on June 17. The bodies of seven U.S. sailors were found in a flooded berthing area after that collision. The latest accident has already prompted a fleet-wide investigation and plans for temporary halts in operations.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said to have sailors killed in two collisions this year was disconcerting. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just unacceptable and we‚Äôll get to the bottom of it,‚Äù Pence told Fox News. ‚ÄúBut right now our hearts are with the families of those that are lost and we honor them.‚Äù

Ships, aircraft and divers from an international search-and-rescue operation have been looking for the missing U.S. sailors to the east of Singapore and peninsula Malaysia, near where the accident happened. Aircraft from the amphibious assault ship the USS America, which was in port at Changi Naval Base, joined the search.

Earlier on Tuesday, divers equipped with surface-supplied air rigs got into compartments in damaged parts of the USS John S McCain. Immediate efforts by the ship‚Äôs crew after the collision on Monday were able to halt flooding into other parts of the hull, the Seventh Fleet said in a statement on its website.

CNN, citing unidentified U.S. Navy officials, said early indications suggested the collision was caused by a steering malfunction as the warship approached the Strait of Malacca. Swift said it was too early to draw conclusions about the cause and whether it was the result of human error. Aircraft and vessels from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have been helping with the search.

HOLE IN HULL

Swift said the U.S. Navy was sending a team to assess the damage before making a decision whether to move the ship or place it in drydock. Singapore‚Äôs Maritime and Port Authority said it had deployed 250 personnel for the search-and-rescue effort over an expanded area of 2,620 square kilometres. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said it had deployed more than 500. Five U.S. sailors were injured in the accident, although the U.S. Navy said none of those injuries was life-threatening.

On Monday, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said there were no indications so far the collision was intentional or the result of cyber intrusion or sabotage. ‚ÄúBut review will consider all possibilities,‚Äù he said on Twitter. Richardson said he was asking his fleet commanders worldwide for a one-to-two-day, staggered ‚Äúoperational pause‚Äù to discuss action to ensure safe and effective operations. He also said a comprehensive review would examine the training of U.S. forces deployed to Japan. The U.S. Seventh Fleet is headquartered in Japan.

The accident comes at a tense time for the U.S. Navy in Asia. This month, the John S. McCain sailed within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built by China in the disputed South China Sea, the latest ‚Äúfreedom of navigation‚Äù operation to counter what the United States sees as China‚Äôs efforts to control the waters.

The state-run China Daily said in an editorial that increased activities by U.S. warships in Asia-Pacific were a growing risk to commercial shipping.

Also this month, North Korea threatened to fire ballistic missiles towards the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam in a standoff over its nuclear and missile programmes.

This is what Sunil Grover has to say about long-lost friend Kapil Sharma‚Äôs Firangi,"Looks like everything has cooled down between Sunil Grover and Kapil Sharma. Looks like everything has cooled down between Sunil Grover and Kapil Sharma.

Sunil Grover and Kapil Sharma‚Äôs tiff was a major disappointment for a number of fans, who religiously followed their show on television. And now with the news of them patching things up, audiences have been hoping for them to get back together and begin their laughter riot once again on The Kapil Sharma Show.

When a Twitter user asked the comedian to say something about Kapil‚Äôs second Bollywood venture Firangi, here is what the actor had to say.

"President Ashraf Ghani welcomes Donald Trump‚Äôs news South Asia strategy , says ‚ÄòUS-Afghan partnership stronger than ever‚Äô","Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. (PTI photo) Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. (PTI photo)

President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday welcomed US President Donald Trump‚Äôs new South Asia strategy to combat terrorism in Afghanistan saying the move is an affirmation of the joint effort by his country and the US to free the region from the ‚Äùthreat of terrorism‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am grateful to President Trump and the American people for this affirmation of support for our efforts to achieve self-reliance and for our joint effort to rid the region of the threat of terrorism,‚Äù said Ghani.

He added that the US Afghan Partnership is stronger than ever and peace in the region remains the priority of the new US strategy. ‚ÄúThe US Afghan Partnership is stronger than ever ever in overcoming the threat that terrorism that threatens all of us‚Ä¶ The objective of peace is paramount. Peace remains our priority,‚Äù said Ghani.

Hailing America‚Äôs effort to combat terrorism in the region, Ghani said, ‚ÄúIt (new South Asia strategy) puts particular emphasis on enhancing Afghan air power, doubling the size of Afghan Special Forces, deepening NATO‚Äôs ability to train, advise and assist Afghan National Defence and Security forces.‚Äù

Earlier in the day, while announcing his Afghanistan and South Asia strategy, Donald Trump criticized Islamabad‚Äôs continued support for cross-border terrorism and warned Pakistan of consequences for providing safe havens to terrorists and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. ‚ÄúIn Afghanistan and Pakistan, America‚Äôs interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter,‚Äù Donald Trump had said in his speech.

Trunp also said that US approach to Pakistan would change under the new policy and India would play a larger role in establishing peace in the region. ‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond. Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists‚Ä¶We appreciate India‚Äôs important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region,‚Äù Trump said.

Iraq must ensure Islamic State‚Äôs victims of sexual violence see justice -U.N,"U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‚Äôad Al Hussein said, ‚ÄúThe physical, mental, and emotional injuries inflicted by ISIL are almost beyond comprehension.‚Äù (Source: AP/File) U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‚Äôad Al Hussein said, ‚ÄúThe physical, mental, and emotional injuries inflicted by ISIL are almost beyond comprehension.‚Äù (Source: AP/File)

Iraq must ensure that women and girls subjected to sexual violence at the hands of Islamic State militants have access to justice and reparations, U.N. investigators said on Tuesday.

Thousands of people, predominantly from Iraq‚Äôs ethnic and religious minorities, have been subjected to sexual violence since Islamic State militants swept across vast swathes of Iraq in 2014. The report pays particular attention to members of the country‚Äôs Yazidi community, who were kidnapped and forcibly converted, enslaved or conscripted to fight for the militants.

‚ÄúWomen and girls under the control of ISIL, in particular women from the Yazidi and other minority communities, have been especially vulnerable to abuses of human rights and violation of international humanitarian law,‚Äù the report by the U.N. Assistance Mission to Iraq and the U.N. Human Rights Office said.

More than 6,800 Yazidis were kidnapped by Islamic State. About 3,000 of them are still believed to be held captive.

Victims must be provided with access to appropriate medical, psychosocial and financial support, the report said. ‚ÄúThe physical, mental, and emotional injuries inflicted by ISIL are almost beyond comprehension. If victims are to rebuild their lives, and indeed those of their children, they need justice and they need redress,‚Äù said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‚Äôad Al Hussein.

The report, based on interviews with survivors, found that support for the victims must come with significant changes to the criminal justice system to prove effective. U.N. investigators highlighted gaps in the legal frameworks of both Iraq and Iraq‚Äôs autonomous Kurdish Region, which ‚Äúlargely fail to ensure the appropriate respect and protection of women and children who have been subjected to sexual and other forms of violence‚Äù. Iraq‚Äôs laws governing sexual and domestic violence offer inadequate protections for women, and would be an obstacle to the prosecution of Islamic State-related crimes, the report said.

The report comes three days after Iraqi security forces launched their offensive to retake the city of Tal Afar, one of the militant groups‚Äô last remaining strongholds in Iraq. ‚ÄúWith significant areas under the control of ISIL having been reclaimed, it is now urgent to consider what steps need to be taken to ensure the protection, recovery, reintegration and redress for the thousands of women and girls,‚Äù the report states.

Though the report focuses on crimes committed by Islamic State, it also references abuses committed by groups fighting against the militants. These include ‚Äúrevenge attacks‚Äù against women thought to have been affiliated with IS, sometimes sanctioned by tribal agreements.

Marriage licenses and birth certificates issued in IS-held territories are generally not recognized by Iraqi and Kurdish officials. The report recommends that this be rectified, to avoid leaving women and babies without legal status, particularly those born of sexual slavery. UNHCR has identified nearly 800 children whose births had been registered by Islamic State in areas under its control. Investigators found that men and boys had also been subjected to sexual violence by the militants.

Tuesday‚Äôs report builds on last year‚Äôs finding that Islamic State was committing genocide against the Yazidi people. The rare designation under international law marked the first time genocide was recognized as being carried out by non-state actors.

Liking different brands can make partners unhappy: Study,"If you‚Äôre the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner‚Äôs preferences, you are going to be less happy. (Source: Thinkstock Images) If you‚Äôre the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner‚Äôs preferences, you are going to be less happy. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

It may not seem like a big deal whether your partner prefers Coke or Pepsi, but scientists suggest that liking different brands can affect our happiness in relationships more than shared interests or personality traits.

‚ÄúPeople think compatibility in relationships comes from having similar backgrounds, religion or education,‚Äù said Gavan Fitzsimons, a professor at Duke University in the US.

‚ÄúBut we find those things don‚Äôt explain how happy you are in life nearly as much as this notion of brand compatibility,‚Äù said Fitzsimons.

The researchers found that partners who had low power in their relationships ‚Äì those who do not feel they can shape their partner‚Äôs behaviour ‚Äì tend to find themselves stuck with their partner‚Äôs preferred brands.

‚ÄúIf you are lower in relationship power and have different brand preferences than your partner, you‚Äôre probably going to find yourself stuck with your partner‚Äôs favourite brands, over and over again. This could lead to a death-by-a-thousand-cuts feeling,‚Äù said Danielle Brick, now at the University of New Hampshire.

‚ÄúMost couples won‚Äôt break up over brand incompatibility, but it leads to the low power partner becoming less and less happy,‚Äù said Brick.

Studies in several settings produced the same result. The researchers used brand preferences in soda, coffee, chocolate, beer and automobiles to study individuals and couples, some of whom were tracked over two years.

These results were combined with findings on relationship power and happiness.

Brick said it is likely these brand compatibility effects have steadily gained strength as brands have evolved to play a bigger role in the daily lives of consumers.

However, they are not given the same weight as other relationship-influencing factors because they are not seen as significant.

‚ÄúIf you are a different religion than your romantic partner, you know that if this is an issue you can‚Äôt work through, then the relationship isn‚Äôt going to last,‚Äù Brick said.

‚ÄúConversely, if you like Coke and your partner likes Pepsi, you‚Äôre probably not going to break up over it ‚Äì but 11 years into a relationship, when he or she keeps coming home with Pepsi, day in and day out, it might start to cause a little conflict,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre the low-power person in the relationship, who continually loses out on brands and is stuck with your partner‚Äôs preferences, you are going to be less happy,‚Äù she added.

The research was published in the Journal of Consumer Research.

Sonia Gandhi on right to privacy: SC verdict strikes at ‚Äòunbridled encroachment and surveillance‚Äô on people,"Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi.

Hailing the Supreme Court verdict declaring the right to privacy a fundamental right, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said the judgment strikes at ‚Äúunbridled encroachment and surveillance‚Äù by the State and its agencies on the life of the common man. She added that Congress and other opposition parties have together spoken for the right to privacy against ‚Äúarrogant‚Äù attempts of BJP govt to curtail them.

Echoing similar view, Gandhi‚Äôs son and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said that the apex court verdict was a major blow to ‚Äúfascist forces‚Äù and a rejection of the BJP‚Äôs ideology of ‚Äúsuppression through surveillance‚Äù. The judgment was a ‚Äúvictory for every Indian‚Äù, Gandhi said on Twitter.

‚ÄúWelcome the SC verdict upholding Right to Privacy as an intrinsic part of individual‚Äôs liberty, freedom, and dignity. The SC decision marks a major blow to fascist forces,‚Äù he tweeted. It was a ‚Äúsound rejection‚Äù of the BJP‚Äôs ideology of ‚Äúsuppression through surveillance‚Äù, Gandhi said.

In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court unanimously declared that the right to privacy was a fundamental right under the Constitution. A nine-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar ruled that the right was ‚Äúan intrinsic part of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21 and the entire Part III of the Constitution‚Äù.

The ruling on the highly contentious issue dealt with petitions challenging the Centre‚Äôs move to make Aadhaar mandatory for people seeking to benefit from various social welfare schemes.

Switzerland‚Äôs attorney general has indicted a Swiss woman suspected of trying to reach Syria to join the Islamic State group with her four-year-old child in tow. The office of Attorney General Michael Lauber says the 30-year-old from the Zurich area, whose name wasn‚Äôt released, was indicted for alleged violations of laws banning al-Qaida, IS and associated extremist groups.

The indictment announced today alleges that she travelled illegally with her child from Egypt to Greece in December 2015 in hopes of crossing from neighbouring Turkey into Syria. Greek authorities prevented her from continuing the journey and handed her over to Swiss authorities in January last year.

Switzerland‚Äôs intelligence agency estimates that 89 people have left Switzerland since 2001 to participate in jihad, including 75 who went to Syria and Iraq.

South Korea‚Äôs first woman PM Han Myeong-Sook released from jail,"Han has denied any wrongdoing. (Express Archive) Han has denied any wrongdoing. (Express Archive)

South Korea‚Äôs first female prime minister was released from prison today after completing a two-year sentence for accepting illicit political funds. Han Myeong-Sook, now 73, was prime minister for a year from April 2006 under the liberal government of then-president Roh Moo-Hyun. She was the first woman to hold the post of prime minister in South Korea, and also the first former premier to be put behind bars.

A few years later Park Geun-Hye, currently on trial for corruption after being ousted in a sprawling scandal, became South Korea‚Äôs first woman president. Han was convicted in 2015 of receiving 880 million won (then $760,000) from a businessman in illegal campaign funding for her eventually unsuccessful 2007 bid to secure her party‚Äôs presidential nomination. Han has denied any wrongdoing and accused the then-conservative government of using state prosecutors to tarnish her reputation. She was greeted by politicians and hundreds of supporters as she emerged from a detention centre on the outskirts of Seoul early today.

‚ÄúThere has been insufferable pain during the past two years but I have finally met a new world and I am grateful,‚Äù she was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency. Several former presidents have been embroiled in corruption scandals in South Korea, where politics and big business have long been closely tied. Former leaders Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo served jail terms in the 1990s for charges including bribery and treason, and ex-president Roh Moo-Hyun, the mentor of President MoonJae-In, killed himself in 2009 after being questioned overgraft.

Spanish police on Monday shot dead a man who could be Younes Abouyaaqoub, the suspected driver of a van that mowed down pedestrians in Barcelona, amid a massive manhunt for the Moroccan national described as dangerous and likely armed. ‚ÄúThey have shot dead a suspect who could be the perpetrator of the attack,‚Äù a source close to the probe told AFP on condition of anonymity. Regional police confirmed a man wearing what appeared to be a suicide belt had been killed in Subirats, a village about 60 kilometres (37 miles) away from Barcelona, without identifying the individual. Bomb disposal units have been dispatched to the site.

Earlier on Monday, police had launched an appeal for information about the 22-year-old fugitive, believed to be the last remaining member of a 12-man cell suspected of plotting last week‚Äôs deadly attacks. The other suspects have been killed by police or detained after the vehicle rampages in Barcelona and the seaside resort of Cambrils. The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the assaults, believed to be its first in Spain.

Authorities on Monday raised the death toll to 15, confirming that Pau Perez, a 34-year-old man found stabbed to death in a Ford Focus outside Barcelona on Friday, was killed by Abouyaaqoub. The police had fired at the car as it forced its way through a checkpoint shortly after the Barcelona carnage, and later found Perez in the vehicle. Investigators believe the victim was the owner of the car, which was hijacked by Abouyaaqoub to make his getaway.

Describing Abouyaaqoub as around 1.8 metres (five feet, 11 inches) tall, police tweeted four photographs of the man with short black hair, including three pictures in which he was wearing a black and white striped T-shirt. He is ‚Äúdangerous and could be armed,‚Äù police in Catalonia said. Spanish authorities were also officially notifying European police of the identity of the suspect to enable the launch of a Europe-wide manhunt.

Anger boils over at Charlottesville council meeting,"Protesters yell during the Charlottesville City Council meeting. (Source: AP) Protesters yell during the Charlottesville City Council meeting. (Source: AP)

Anger boiled over at the first Charlottesville City Council meeting since a white nationalist rally in the city descended into violent chaos, with some residents screaming and cursing at councilors Monday night and calling for their resignations.

Scores of people packed the council‚Äôs chambers, and The Daily Progress reported Mayor Mike Signer was interrupted by shouting several times in the first few minutes of the meeting. As tensions escalated, the meeting was halted. Live video showed protesters standing on a dais with a sign that said, ‚ÄúBlood on your hands.‚Äù

After talking with members of the crowd, Councilor Wes Bellamy said the council would drop its agenda and focus on the crowd‚Äôs concerns, the newspaper reported.

Speakers, some yelling and hurling profanities, then took turns addressing the council, some expressing frustration that leaders had granted a permit for the Aug. 12 rally that had turned violent. Others criticized the police response to the event, which drew hundreds of white nationalists and other counter-protesters.

The two sides clashed violently in the street that day, largely uninterrupted by authorities, until the event was declared an unlawful assembly and the crowd was forced to disperse. Later, a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman and injuring 19 others. The death toll for the day climbed to three when a helicopter that had been monitoring the event and assisting with the governor‚Äôs motorcade crashed, killing two state troopers.

The event dubbed ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù was sparked by the city‚Äôs decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Neither a city spokeswoman nor a Charlottesville police spokesman immediately responded to questions from The Associated Press about reports that three people were arrested Monday. At one point, the crowd chanted, ‚ÄúSigner must go.‚Äù

Elsewhere in Charlottesville, dozens of students rallied Monday night at the University of Virginia in rejection of the violence. Video of the event streamed by the newspaper on social media showed students marching on the stately grounds of Virginia‚Äôs flagship public university.

The event was billed as a ‚Äúreclaim our grounds‚Äù rally and organizers said it was held to highlight the advances made at the university to end racism and discrimination in recent decades. The organizers also said via social media that they were seeking to send a message to the university leadership that more advances were still needed.

Earlier Monday, the man who authorities say drove his car into the crowd of counter-protesters Aug. 12 made a second court appearance. The Charlottesville Commonwealth‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs Office said James Alex Fields Jr., 20, appeared by video Monday. It was his first hearing on a second set of charges filed against him last week.

Senior assistant Commonwealth‚Äôs Attorney Nina Antony says a judge declined for now to set bond for Fields, who has another hearing Friday. The charges against Fields include second-degree murder. In addition to the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, police said, some of the 19 people injured when the crowd was rammed by the car suffered serious and permanent injuries. Fields‚Äô attorney couldn‚Äôt immediately be reached.

"Death toll rises to 12 as typhoon Hato hit Macau, Hong Kong","A fallen tree is seen next to traffic along a road following Typhoon Hato in Macau, China, August 24, 2017 in this picture obtained from social media. A fallen tree is seen next to traffic along a road following Typhoon Hato in Macau, China, August 24, 2017 in this picture obtained from social media.

Typhoon Hato, the strongest to hit southern China in 53 years, left a trail of death and destruction in the region with Macau and Hong Kong bearing the brunt of the storm that has claimed at least 12 lives and injured over 150 others. The former Portuguese enclave of Macau was still without electricity as the typhoon claimed the lives of at least eight people.

The typhoon made landfall on Wednesday, bringing winds of up to 160 kilometre per hour to the mouth of the Pearl river and heavy rain to nearby regions, the local meteorological bureau said. At least 150 people were injured, and residents had been struggling with a massive power failure for nearly 24 hours in Macau, South China Morning Post reported on Thursday.

When the typhoon swept past Macau, a wall brought down by strong winds killed a man. Another person died after falling from the 11th floor of a building, and a third after being hit by a truck, according to Macau health authorities.

Chief Executive Fernando Chui Sai-on said it was the strongest storm recorded in Macau in 53 years, adding that it had had a severe impact across the city.

He expressed his condolences to the families of those who had died, and conveyed sympathy for everyone affected by the typhoon. ‚ÄúThe government is dedicating continued effort regarding coordinating the restoration of water and electricity supplies in order to ensure the Macau public can resume their normal lives as quickly as possible,‚Äù Chui was quoted as saying by the report.

In Hong Kong, more than 120 were injured as the financial hub was lashed with hurricane winds and heavy rain.

In Guangdong, four people were killed and one remained unaccounted for.

The government has evacuated 26,817 people to temporary shelters. About 664 hectares of farmland has been damaged.

Power transmission facilities suffered heavy loss, disrupting electricity supply to 1.91 million households. About half of the households had power back by late yesterday.

In Zhuhai, a ship which lost control amid gales and high tides hit a pier of a major bridge, causing the bridge surface to tilt. The bridge, part of a coastal highway, was cordoned off.

Alerts for landslides, flooding and other geological disasters have been issued. ‚ÄúCompared to other typhoons, Hato moved fast, quickly grew more powerful and caused massive amounts of rainfall,‚Äù said Wu Zhifang, chief weather forecaster at Guangdong meteorological bureau.

(Source: Reuters)

Meteorologists had earlier warned of unusually high flooding as the typhoon came during high tides.

Hundreds of thousands of residents in low-lying areas, workers on coastal fish farms, and tourists have been transferred to safer places.

In one of the hardest-hit areas, 19 villages near the town of Guanghai, Taishan city, were flooded and power was cut off. However, no casualties have been reported as the evacuation started early.

In Zhuhai, trees and billboards have been blown down. At a wharf, boats were pushed onto shore while vehicles on the roads were floated. But floodwater has begun to recede.

Huang Xin, an employee of a fishing gear shop at the wharf, said the shop‚Äôs gate and windows were broken by huge tides. Boats, though being moored, were damaged.

Across the province, classes and work were suspended in many cities. Several expressways were closed and train services halted.

At least six ships on the mouth of the Pearl river have reported emergencies. Maritime rescue workers saved 118 crew, according to the Ministry of Transportation. Hato is forecast to move northwest and enter Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region by dawn today. As the typhoon moves further inland, its strength is expected to drop.

In Guangxi, more than 15,000 workers at the local power grid were put on standby while precautions have been taken to minimise the damage caused by potential flooding and landslides. More than 11,860 fishing boats have been moored.

In a historic judgment, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that privacy is a fundamental right, intrinsic under Article 21 and part III of the Constitution. A nine-judge Constitution bench also overruled the verdicts in the MP Sharma and Kharak Singh cases that had held that the Constitution did not protect the right to privacy. The decision is being seen as a huge setback to the central government that contested in court that the Constitution does not guarantee individual privacy as an inalienable fundamental right. Reacting to the verdict, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, however, stated that the Supreme Court‚Äôs decisions in the case was in consonance with that of the Centre‚Äôs position. In a series of tweets, the Minister said the BJP government was always in favour of right to privacy as fundamental to the citizens, inviting a barrage of backlash on the micro-blogging site, especially by people who pointed out how previously the Central government has maintained that this fundamental right is not absolute.

A Man of His Times,"This book is primarily a compendium of Kanvinde‚Äôs most important works over these five decades. This book is primarily a compendium of Kanvinde‚Äôs most important works over these five decades.

ACHYUT KANVINDE AKAR

Edited by Tanuja & Sanjay Kanvinde

Niyogi books

464 pages

` 7,000

By Riyaz Tayyibji

Achyut Kanvinde, born in the small village of Achara in Maharashtra, belonged to the first generation of modern Indian architects who returned to practice in India after an education abroad, in their quest to find an appropriate contemporary expression for a young country with a long past.

Contrary to popular belief, modern architectural design did not find its way to the subcontinent on the back of Le Corbusier. A group of young Indian architects including Habib Rehman, Piloo Modi and Achyut Kanvinde had already established a base here with their work. Kanvinde, deeply influenced by the great Walter Gropius, had a strong rationalist orientation and an exposure to engineering and construction, which would profoundly influence the course of Indian architecture in the five decades after independence.

This book is primarily a compendium of Kanvinde‚Äôs most important works over these five decades. The work itself is presented chronologically and their decade-wise grouping subtly brings out the fundamental shifts in Kanvinde‚Äôs work over his incredibly prolific career. Along with the architectural work, which is represented through generously sized drawings (including a marvellous appendix of construction drawings) and photographs, this book also contains the great architects‚Äô own words and writings.

One glimpses a wide array of subjects, from his own work to architectural education, the role of the building professional, and, most engagingly, anecdotes of his experiences with the many great people he worked with. From statesmen like Jawaharlal Nehru, the industrious Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and Dr. Homi Bhabha to the master architects: Gropius, Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. These personal experiences are not only of historical value, but make for enthralling reading for anyone interested in history, architecture or simply the spirit and energy of the time just after 1947. Kanvinde‚Äôs own writings are simple, and deal directly with the problems and solutions pertaining to our built environment. The tone of his writing, as much as their content, gives us insight into the man known for his quiet humility, unequalled generosity and professional commitment.

In order to tell us more about the man, the editors have interspersed a series of essays into the book, written by Kanvinde‚Äôs colleagues, historians and family members, thus creating a background to the work that ranges from the historical to the intimate. However, though an important aspect of the book, this is also, perhaps, its weakest link. The essays are informative, but lack a certain tautness of narrative.

Much more importantly, the book re-produces the work done by Kanvinde at the JJ School of Architecture during his student days. Comprising both sketches and project work, these drawings talk about the predilection and general direction of the country‚Äôs architectural education at the time. The book looks at that historic moment of May 17, 1959, when, at the ‚ÄòSeminar on Architecture‚Äô at Lalit Kala Academy, Kanvinde delivered an address titled ‚ÄòArchitectural Expression and National Policy‚Äô. Kanvinde argued for a functional, technology-driven modern architecture embedded in the society of the day. The historical implications of this event are not lost on the editors of this book as they reproduce Nehru‚Äôs address along with Kanvinde‚Äôs own intimate anecdotes about proceedings.

Modern buildings are rarely ‚Äòpretty‚Äô. Made in bare materials and unadorned by softer finishes, they‚Äôre robust and driven by functional needs. Yet, in the hands of a great architect, like Kanvinde, these buildings have a fierce and powerful beauty. There is a tactile exploration of material, their organisation into evocative structural configurations that allow for a play of light, of inside and outside, of sun and shadow, of movement and gathering. This is an architecture of doing a lot with very little: for a country that had very little. One simply has to turn to page 148 and look at Kanvinde‚Äôs Dudhusagar dairy project for the National Dairy Development Board at Mehsana, to recognise that an industrial building can be given a poetry of form. Balanced horizontals and verticals, the play of raw concrete and white plaster, the power of architectural composition squeezed out from a most pragmatic of requirements.

This book brings out the unparalleled relentlessness with which Kanvinde followed his modernist convictions. An almost spiritual orientation which helped the architect find a deep resonance with the historic architecture of the subcontinent. Though modern in its appearance, his buildings seem to imbibe an age-old understanding of the environment in which he built.

Throughout his career Kanvinde‚Äôs work was in partnership, first with Shaukat Rai, and then with the addition of Murad Chaudhary. This book documents his final decade of practice, which was largely a

personal one. Now, he challenges his rationalist approach with projects that have high symbolic content (temples) and require logic other than function. He responds to these self-set challenges by returning to his roots ‚Äî to his JJ School training and to the poetry of Tukaram. Kanvinde‚Äôs life work is a study of systematic architectural development in search of dissolution and belonging. An architect who takes the impulses and influences from a foreign place and brings them home. This book is a fitting tribute to the journey of India‚Äôs greatest professional, modern architect.

Speaking of Ramanujan,"When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan‚Äôs Poetics by Guillermo Rodriguez. When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan‚Äôs Poetics by Guillermo Rodriguez.

Title: When Mirrors are Windows: A View of AK Ramanujan‚Äôs Poetics

Author: Guillermo Rodriguez

Publisher: Oxford University Press

Pages: 576

Price: Rs 1195

I am always wary of being told how to read a poet. When it is a poet whose work I care for, my resistance increases. And so, it was somewhat guardedly that I picked up this book on AK Ramanujan, a writer towards whom I feel not mere admiration, but gratitude and a very real kinship.

Every writer creates his own precursors, wrote the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges. For me, AKR is a precursor for several reasons. I have long enjoyed the philosophical restlessness, the quiet self-deprecating irony, the unobtrusive rigour of his poetry. I recently revisited his translations of Nammalvar and was struck all over again by his alchemic ability to transform a 1,000-year-old poet into our contemporary ‚Äî urgent, fearless, hoarse with longing and naked greed. AKR, at such times, becomes a precursor because, as translator, he uncovers for us an entire literary genealogy to which we can now claim allegiance.

More recently, on re-reading poems like ‚ÄòFear No Fall‚Äô, that moving evocation of the Tamil saint poet Arunagiri, I have felt a growing curiosity about the intersections between AKR as poet-intellectual and as a translator of ecstatic mystical verse. These later poems seem to offer glimpses of the poet as pilgrim, one who values literary poise and precision, but yearns also for the inspired self-forgetfulness of ‚Äòpossession‚Äô.

What makes Rodriguez‚Äôs volume rewarding is the fact that he shares the wonder of discovering AKR. Drawing on scholarly essays as well as AKR‚Äôs own private journals and unpublished work, it adopts an approach that is ‚Äòboth context sensitive and reflexive‚Äô, formal and biographical, academic and introspective, allowing each category to interrogate and nourish the other. And, underlying this whole exercise, is a passionate curiosity about AKR. Through this multifocal lens, we are offered fascinating access to the mind of the poet ‚Äî chronically incapable of rigidity or narrowness, hungry for places where beauty meets truth, often fractured by self-doubt, reluctant to rest content with easy victories, and always deeply, instinctively exploratory.

There is nothing schematic or critically legislative about this volume. It constantly invites the reader to look beyond pat binaries: east-west, akam-puram, interior-exterior, emotional-intellectual, insider-outsider, private-public, mother tongue-father tongue, little tradition-big tradition. Nuancing each category, it cautions us from reading AKR‚Äôs journey as that of the homesick exile, rediscovering his Indian roots in a foreign land. Instead, it reminds us of the complexity and variety of his inheritance in India, his ability to draw upon his Tamil and Kannada literary background without resorting to a chauvinist discourse, and his stout refusal to see either the Western or the Indian as monolithic categories.

‚ÄòBetween‚Äô becomes the operative word here. It signifies an awareness of the hyphen as a tremendous possibility that allows for a condition of multiple citizenship. Indeed, Ramanujan wryly described himself as ‚Äúthe hyphen in Indo-American studies‚Äù.

The book is liberally peppered with interesting quotes. In one, Ramanujan calls himself ‚Äúa multiple monolingual‚Äù. In another: ‚ÄúIt looks as if I live between things all the time ‚Äî two (or more) languages, two countries, two disciplines.‚Äù Or, yet again: ‚ÄúThe whole question of roots is not relevant to me‚Ä¶ India is me and with me‚Ä¶‚Äù And again, ‚ÄòIt takes some time before you realise that there are limits your culture has placed on you. Only they are not just limits. They are also resources.‚Äô

AKR‚Äôs image of his childhood home as a multi-tiered cultural abode (he imbibed Tamil from his mother, Sanskrit and English from his father) is significant in its refusal to posit an immutable divide between inside and outside, mother and father tongue: ‚Äú[There was] a downstairs for the Tamil world, an upstairs for the English and the Sanskrit, and a terrace on top that was open to the sky‚Ä¶ Each had a literature that was unlike the others‚Ä¶and it became the business of a lifetime for some of us to keep the dialogues and quarrels alive and to make something of them.‚Äù

There is no cultural machismo here ‚Äî no impulse to celebrate akam over puram, foundation over terrace. Indeed, how can there be when the terrace is always open to the wilderness of sky ‚Äî always challenging any snug, self-serving, static identity, aware of the tensions and ambiguities within each tradition, forever inviting us to discovery?

The ideal book on AKR, says Rodriguez, would ‚Äòhave to be written by a multidisciplinary team comprising a cultural anthropologist, a literary critic and theorist, a specialist in modern Indian poetry in English and Kannada, a Sanskritist, a Dravidian literature expert, a folklorist, a linguist, a translator and a poet‚Äô. Or, he adds, all of the above! One sees his point. It is a tall order. And yet, I suspect a vital key to understanding Ramanujan lies in seeing him foremost as a poet. It is the poet‚Äôs capacity to revel in metaphor and slippage, to distrust the rigidly ideological and doctrinaire, to doubt deeply and yet stay open to mystery, that, I imagine, made Ramanujan the inspired translator and scholar he was.

This, then, is the enduring contribution of this volume: the insight that it offers into inner workings of the mind of a remarkable writer-scholar, his capacity to remain poised between identities, to see their ruptures and continuities, without giving in to the extremes of foaming parochialism or glib internationalism. We rediscover Ramanujan as our culturally sophisticated contemporary ‚Äî more fascinating and more urgently relevant to our lives than ever before. Arundhathi Subramaniam is an award-winning poet and author.

"After English conquest, Shubman Gill wills for domestic grind","Shubman Gill was the Player of the Series in the five-match ODI series in England. (Source: File) Shubman Gill was the Player of the Series in the five-match ODI series in England. (Source: File)

‚ÄúHaan sir, thoda sa jet lag hain,‚Äù Shubman Gill‚Äôs voice is raspy and there is a distinct quiver in his tone as he begins the telephonic conversation. Shubman is clearly feeling a severe jet lag. It‚Äôs been barely 24 hours since the 17-year-old has returned home in Mohali after spending close to a month in England as one of the key members of India‚Äôs U-19 squad. The teenager from Punjab‚Äôs Ferozpur district describes his first international sojourn as ‚Äúdeeply fulfilling.‚Äù The manner in which he strung together a series of match-winning knocks was instrumental in the colts completing a historic whitewash ‚Äì thumping England 2-0 in Tests and then proceeding to clinch the one-day series 5-0.

It was in the shorter format that Shubman came into his own. Batting at No.3, he stacked up 278 runs from four games, which included a stunning 147. Such was his dominance that India‚Äôs next highest scorer ‚Äì ODI captain Prithvi Shaw ‚Äì could muster only 160 runs. Finishing as the highest run-getter in the series, the teen known for his sparkling stroke-play and an appetite for big scores, walked away with the Player of the Series award.

There‚Äôs something about England that brings out the best in Shubman. He had a dream series earlier this year when England toured India ‚Äì amassing 351 runs from 4 innings. ‚ÄúWinning the Man of the Series award has boosted my confidence‚Ä¶ this tour has really helped me as a player,‚Äù he adds. Shubman may have finished the England tour on a high, but barely two weeks into his first international assignment, he was nowhere close to his sprightly, effervescent self. Coming into the second innings of the final Test match at Worcester, Shubman has scores of 29,21 and 24. He was getting starts, but was somehow not being able to convert. WV Raman, the stand-in coach filling up for Rahul Dravid for this tour, understood the reasons for the youngster‚Äôs travails. His advice was simple ‚Äì In England, wait for the ball and play as late as possible.

‚ÄúEarly in the Test series, I thought he was playing a touch too early. On docile tracks in India, you can get away by either committing too early or by hitting through the line. In England, where there is a bit more nip, you have to wait for that extra couple of seconds so that you can allow the ball to come to you,‚Äù Raman explains. As Shubman walked out to bat in the second innings in Worcester, the conditions were far from ideal ‚Äì it was cloudy and windy and the England bowlers were getting ample bite from the surface. To make matters worse, there was intermittent rain, turning the day‚Äôs play into a stop-start affair. Raman‚Äôs brightest ward hung in, keen to make it count. ‚ÄúI had never played in such conditions before. It was cold and there was constant rain, which meant that as a batsman I always had to switch on and switch off,‚Äù Shubman explains. He would survive a testing passage of play and score a century ‚Äì one that was bereft of his usual flamboyance. He terms his 102 in Worcester as one of his best knocks yet.

‚ÄúHe is a young guy and on his first trip to England‚Ä¶ such issues are bound to crop up. I think, such tours are part of the learning curve,‚Äù Raman adds. India colts‚Äô stand-in coach lavished praise on the Punjab batsman, calling him a player for the future. ‚ÄúHe is a majestic player. He packs a punch in his shots, and has an appetite for big scores. The three innings in the Test series were just a minor blip, to be honest.‚Äù

Shubman admits that playing and constant travelling meant he had little time for either shopping or sightseeing in England. ‚ÄúWe hardly got off days on the tour. During the odd day, we would be so tired that we preferred spending time in our hotel rooms in front of our Playstation consoles,‚Äù he explains. With the extremely productive England tour coming to an end, the youngster has now set his sights on the upcoming Ranji Trophy. ‚ÄúPlaying the Ranji Trophy for Punjab is my dream. I played in the List A matches last year, so I‚Äôm hopeful of getting picked this season,‚Äù he offers.

Even if he is picked, Punjab will not be able to avail his services for the entire season. That‚Äôs because the U-19 squad will need him back at the top of the order when the Asia Cup begins in Kuala Lumpur in November. Shubman believes such tours are ideal preparatory ground for the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand. ‚ÄúI think such tournaments are scheduled for us to prepare for next year‚Äôs World Cup as these matches give us the experience on how to approach high-pressure games,‚Äù he adds.

"Notices issued to BCCI office-bearers, asked to explain reforms inaction","Three top officer bearers of the BCCI were on Wednesday directed by the Supreme Court to appear before it to explain why its order on Justice R M Lodha panel recommendations have not yet been implemented. (Source: File) Three top officer bearers of the BCCI were on Wednesday directed by the Supreme Court to appear before it to explain why its order on Justice R M Lodha panel recommendations have not yet been implemented. (Source: File)

Three top officer bearers of the BCCI, including its acting president CK Khanna and acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary, were on Wednesday directed by the Supreme Court to appear before it to explain why its order on Justice R M Lodha panel recommendations have not yet been implemented. Besides Khanna and Chaudhary, the apex court also issued show cause notice to BCCI treasurer Aniruddh Chaudhry and asked them to appear personally before it on September 19. A three-judge bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra expressed its displeasure that the directions given by the apex court and its order on the recommendations of the Lodha panel have not been implemented yet.

‚ÄúThe whole problem is that nothing has been implemented. We will issue show cause notices and direct for personal presence,‚Äù the bench, also comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, said. The bench also said it would hear the plea filed by Cricket Association of Bihar (CAB), through its secretary Aditya Kumar Verma, alleging that Amitabh Choudhary had disregarded the court‚Äôs direction by inviting disqualified cricket administrators to attend the board‚Äôs meetings.

Senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the bench that these three office-bearers were responsible for implementing the recommendations of the Lodha panel and the apex court‚Äôs directions, but have not done that so far. He alleged that BCCI CEO Rahul Johri, who was accompanied by the legal advisor of the Committee of Administrators (COA), was not allowed to attend the July 26 special general body meeting in which the endevour was not to implement any of the recommendations and the directions passed by the top court.

Senior advocate Puneet Bali, representing these office bearers, countered the submissions of the amicus saying after the July 26 meeting, they had sent e-mails to everyone concerned that all the recommendations must be complied with. To this, the bench observed, ‚Äúyou have expressed your helplessness. Beseechment is not the solution.‚Äù

The apex-court had appointed Committee of Administrators (COA), through senior advocate Parag Tripathi, said that none of the recommendations of the Lodha panel and directions given by the court have been implemented. ‚ÄúThe only idea is not to implement anything. Justice (retd) Vikramajit Sen (who has been appointed administrator of the Delhi and District Cricket Assocition) had said (in the July 26 meeting) that everything contrary to what Lodha panel has said was being done in the meeting,‚Äù he said.

Meanwhile, the bench directed the COA to prepare a draft constitution of the BCCI in terms of its earlier judgment and order on the Lodha panel recommendations. ‚ÄúWe think it appropriate that the COA shall prepare a draft constitution in terms of the main judgement as well as the July 24 order of this court,‚Äù it said, while directing that copies of draft constitution be handed over to all the parties before it.

CoA chairman Vinod Rai told The Indian Express: ‚ÄúThe CoA has been pleading with the (BCCI) office-bearers and they didn‚Äôt see reason. Now, the court has asked for a show-cause, which was inevitable. They have been very intransigent, and nobody can dare to take on the highest court of the land.‚Äù During the arguments, Subramanium referred to the fifth status report of the COA and said that as per it, the office bearers have not taken steps to implement the Lodha panel recommendations. In its fifth report, the COA, headed by former CAG Vinod Rai, had sought the removal of BCCI office-bearers ‚Äì Khanna, Choudhary and Chaudhry.

Subramanium said the apex court should give directions so that the recommendations could be implemented. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for TNCA, said there were certain issues which required to be dealt with by the court.

"In Spain, Muslims hold rally against terrorism following deadly attacks","The protesters brandished banners with slogans such as ‚ÄúI am Muslim and I want to live in peace‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe also are victims‚Äù as they gathered outside Granada city hall. The protesters brandished banners with slogans such as ‚ÄúI am Muslim and I want to live in peace‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe also are victims‚Äù as they gathered outside Granada city hall.

Two hundred Muslims have rallied in the streets of Granada, southern Spain, in protest against a surge in anti-Islamic hate crimes following last week‚Äôs deadly attacks in the country. The yesterday‚Äôs protest was called after the city‚Äôs main mosque was attacked with flares on Saturday by a handful of members from a far-right group, Hogar Social, who also unfurled a Spanish flag outside the building, according to images on Spanish TV.

Muslim groups have reported a jump in anti-Islamic hate incidents since the twin vehicle attacks in Barcelona and the nearby seaside resort of Cambrils that killed 15 people last week. Those attacks were claimed by the Islamic State group. ‚ÄúIt is very important for us to affirm our values as Muslims which are the same as those of all other human beings on this planet,‚Äù said Nizar Liemlahi, director of the Dar Loughat Muslim cultural association, one of the co-organisers of the rally.

Only 0.1 per cent of the world‚Äôs Muslims commit attacks and these people ‚Äúdo not represent our values or our principles,‚Äù added Liemlahi, a psychologist who moved to Spain from Morocco in 2010. The protesters brandished banners with slogans such as ‚ÄúI am Muslim and I want to live in peace‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe also are victims‚Äù as they gathered outside Granada city hall.

Mounir Benjelloun, head of the Spanish Federation of Islamic Religious Entities (FEERI), said the increase in anti-Islamic incidents since the attacks was ‚Äúunbearable‚Äù. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, after what happened, there is an avalanche of cases. In my 25 years in Spain I have not seen anything like it.‚Äù

Vandals have defaced mosques with racist graffiti and some people have posted videos on social media sites calling for the expulsion of all Muslims, he said. About 1,000 Muslims marched in Barcelona on Monday against terrorism.

"Supreme Court judgment on Right to Privacy: What will it mean for WhatsApp, Aadhaar case?","Supreme Court acknowledges right to privacy: What will it mean for Aadhaar, WhatsApp cases? (Representational Image. Biodata being collected for Aadhaar cards. Image via AP) Supreme Court acknowledges right to privacy: What will it mean for Aadhaar, WhatsApp cases? (Representational Image. Biodata being collected for Aadhaar cards. Image via AP)

The Supreme Court of India in a historic judgment has held the right to privacy as an inherent fundamental right, read into Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. This article guarantees right to life and liberty, and the Supreme Court‚Äôs latest verdict has said the ‚Äòright to privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.‚Äò

While the judgment is being hailed as a historic one, it will also have massive implication for other cases which are currently being heard in the Supreme Court. This includes the Aadhaar case, the WhatsApp privacy case, still being heard in the Supreme Court. In the judgment, the Court also talks about informational privacy and what it means in the age of technology and a digital world.

The judgment reads, ‚ÄúInformational privacy is a facet of the right to privacy. The dangers to privacy in an age of information can originate not only from the state but from non-state actors as well.‚Äù So the Supreme Court judgment has recognised that when it comes to privacy, the state is not the only institution which poses danger, rather there can be ‚Äúnon-state actors‚Äù too that need to be kept in consideration. This is something privacy activists in India have been highlighting with the rise of social networks like Facebook, and companies like Google, Microsoft, etc which have a strong control over user data.

The judgment adds the interpretation of the Constitution can‚Äôt be ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù in time, and technological changes have created new concerns. ‚ÄúThe meaning of the Constitution cannot be frozen on the perspectives present when it was adopted. Technological change has given rise to concerns which were not present seven decades ago and the rapid growth of technology may render obsolescent many notions of the present,‚Äù it reads.

It goes on to urge the Indian government to consider and create a ‚Äúrobust regime for data protection. The creation of such a regime requires a careful and sensitive balance between individual interests and legitimate concerns of the state.‚Äù Even when the Supreme Court judgment talks about keeping digital privacy intact, it is also taking into consideration the ideas of ‚Äúprotecting national security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging innovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing the dissipation of social welfare benefits.‚Äù

Further, the court says that when it comes to these issues, it puts the ball in the court of the government. The policy has to be considered by the Union government, says the judgment pointing out there is already a Committee in place headed by Justice B N Srikrishna, former Judge of the Supreme Court, which is looking at the issue of a data protection regime.

The Supreme Court is also hearing a case on WhatsApp‚Äôs privacy policy change. File photo. The Supreme Court is also hearing a case on WhatsApp‚Äôs privacy policy change. File photo.

So what will this judgment mean to the WhatsApp case?

While that can‚Äôt be predicted right now, the WhatsApp case also deals with issue of user privacy. Currently, a five-judge constitution bench is listening to the matter, where the 2016 privacy policy change of WhatsApp is up for discussion. In 2017, WhatsApp announced changes for its privacy policy and said it will share data with Facebook, which is its parent company. The case will have a major implication in India since, WhatsApp is the most popular app in the country with 200 million users alone.

Also read: Privacy is intrinsic to freedom of life and personal liberty: Supreme Court

The government has already told the court it is working on a data protection framework in regard to the case. WhatsApp on its part insists that its app doesn‚Äôt violate user privacy, and since the messages are end-to-end encrypted, they can‚Äôt be read by anyone other than the sender and recipient, and this includes Facebook and WhatsApp.

What will this mean for the Aadhaar case?

The current verdict is not on the other case being heard by a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court on whether the government scheming of linking Aadhaar for all transactions is an infringement of privacy.

The nine-judge verdict is on a petition filed by retired Justice K S Puttaswamy and others, which challenged the collection of biometric data by the government of India under the Aadhaar scheme as being in violation of right to privacy under ‚ÄúArticle 21 of the Constitution of India while other petitioners assert that such a right emanates not only from Article 21 but also from various other articles embodying the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part-III of the Constitution of India.‚Äù The petition was first filed in 2012.

While this verdict settles the issue that privacy is indeed a fundamental right as read into the Constitution, the issue of Aadhaar being made compulsory for various schemes is yet to be examined and decided by the Court. However, today‚Äôs verdict will also end up having an impact on that verdict.

(Source: AP)

Finnish police said on Thursday they had arrested two new suspects over last week‚Äôs stabbing spree that killed two people and which investigators are treating as the country‚Äôs first terror attack. ‚ÄúTwo men have been arrested suspected of preparing an offence to be committed with terrorist intent,‚Äù the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said in a statement.

News agency STT reported that the men were arrested in Turku, the southwestern city where the stabbings took place. The attacker killed two Finnish women in the attack in a market square, wounding eight other people.

The nationality of the two new suspects has not been confirmed ‚Äúbecause they have given contradicting information,‚Äù said the police statement. ‚ÄúTo Finnish authorities, the men have claimed to be Algerian citizens, whereas they have told Swedish authorities they are from Morocco,‚Äù the NBI said, without elaborating.

Investigators also have doubts about the identity of the main suspect, whom police initially identified as Abderrahman Mechkah, an 18-year-old Moroccan asylum seeker who carried out the stabbing. ‚ÄúIn Germany he had more identities. The name in my mind has not been confirmed officially, nor his age,‚Äù NBI chief investigator Olli Toyras told AFP on Tuesday.

He was formally placed in custody on Tuesday suspected of two murders and eight attempted murders ‚Äúwith terrorist intent‚Äù.

Finnish media reported on Wednesday that Mechkah had shown interest in the Islamic State (IS) group.

At the refugee housing centre where he lived, ‚Äúpeople noticed his radical views and behaviour. He spoke of Finns as infidels and asked for tips on how to join IS,‚Äù public broadcaster YLE reported.

Contacted by AFP, the head of the Red Cross in southwestern Finland, Pauli Heikkinen, confirmed that the centre‚Äôs staff had contacted authorities about the suspect‚Äôs behaviour. ‚ÄúPolice are now investigating these links (to IS) and YLE‚Äôs claims,‚Äù he said.

Three other suspects arrested hours after the attack ‚ÄìAbdederrazak Essarioul, Ilyas Berrouh and Mohamed Bakier, all identified by police as Moroccan citizens ‚Äî were also placed in custody on Tuesday.

Police have yet to disclose the nature of their alleged involvement in the crime.

Meanwhile, Abderrahman Mechkah, who was shot by police in the thigh during his arrest minutes after the attack, was transferred from the Turku University Hospital to the Hameenlinna prison hospital on Thursday, the NBI said.

US Navy: Body found by Malaysia not one of McCain‚Äôs missing,"The firing of Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, a three-star admiral, was a rare dismissal of a high-ranking officer for operational reasons. (AP Photo) The firing of Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, a three-star admiral, was a rare dismissal of a high-ranking officer for operational reasons. (AP Photo)

A body found at sea by Malaysian forces is not one of the 10 U.S. sailors missing after a collision between the USS John S. McCain and an oil tanker, the Navy‚Äôs 7th Fleet said Thursday, as more Marine Corps divers joined a search of the destroyer‚Äôs flooded compartments.

The remains found earlier in the week by the Malaysian navy were medically examined and will be returned to Malaysian authorities, the fleet said in a statement.

Divers have found remains in flooded compartments of the McCain, which is docked at Singapore‚Äôs naval base, but the Navy has not disclosed specifics. Five of the 10 missing sailors have been named by relatives.

Aircraft and ships from the navies of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia are searching seas east of Singapore where the collision happened early Monday and the search area continues to expand, the Navy said. More Marine Corps divers have arrived in Singapore to help with the search of the McCain‚Äôs interior, it said.

The commander of the 7th Fleet was relieved of duty Wednesday following the McCain collision and other accidents this year that raised questions about its operations in the Pacific. Seven sailors died in June when the destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off Japan. Two lesser-known incidents occurred earlier in the year.

The firing of Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, a three-star admiral, was a rare dismissal of a high-ranking officer for operational reasons.

‚ÄúFour incidents in a short time in an operational area is a problem,‚Äù he said, though he cautioned against rushing to assign blame. (AP photo) ‚ÄúFour incidents in a short time in an operational area is a problem,‚Äù he said, though he cautioned against rushing to assign blame. (AP photo)

Aucoin was due to retire in a few weeks, and the officer named to succeed him, Vice Adm. Phillip Sawyer, assumed command immediately.

Sawyer, speaking Thursday at a maritime security meeting in Bali, Indonesia, thanked regional navies for helping in the search for the missing McCain sailors.

‚ÄúOften it is a brutal reminder that what we do is dangerous work in an unforgiving environment, requiring honed skills and constant vigilance,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd even with those, bad things can happen.‚Äù

Lawrence Brennan, an adjunct law professor at Fordham University and a retired Navy officer, called Aucoin‚Äôs dismissal ‚Äúan unprecedented peacetime move.‚Äù

‚ÄúFour incidents in a short time in an operational area is a problem,‚Äù he said, though he cautioned against rushing to assign blame.

The Navy has ordered an operational pause for its fleets worldwide to make sure all steps are being taken to ensure safe and effective operations. The Pacific Fleet will also carry out a ship-by-ship review of its vessels, looking at navigation, mechanical systems, bridge resource management and training.

The 7th Fleet said four sailors injured in the collision and taken to a Singapore hospital for treatment were released on Wednesday.

"In the raids: Cross-border traders, lawyers and Watali‚Äôs brother-in-law, driver","A NIA team sets out on a raid in Srinagar in July, when they carried out searches at a number of places in Kashmir and Delhi. Shuaib Masoodi A NIA team sets out on a raid in Srinagar in July, when they carried out searches at a number of places in Kashmir and Delhi. Shuaib Masoodi

Among those whose premises have been raided are businessmen and lawyers with alleged links to separatists

Mohammed Shafi Reshi

A lawyer, his premises were raided by NIA last week. NIA says Reshi is the chairman of Democratic Political Movement in Jammu & Kashmir and close to Hurriyat; it is widely said that these connections helped Reshi‚Äôs nephew Yashir Reshi get elected as an MLC. Reshi is said to have contacts within the PDP, too. NIA claims to have seized documents relating to a complaint against Geelani regarding seizure of foreign currency.

Raja Zahoor Khan

A well known businessman, Khan owns several companies, including Raja Fruit Traders and Khan Impex, with his ancestral fruit business based in Srinagar. He was one of the traders involved in cross-LoC trade and NIA believes he helped route funds to separatists. A laptop, mobile handsets and pen drives, besides cash and gold jewellery, were reportedly seized from him during the raids.

Basheer Ahmad Bhat

He is accused of receiving funds from conduits for separatists, including Raja Zahoor Khan, and transferring these using his own channels. Bhat, according to investigators, is associated with JKLF of Yasin Malik. Bank account details in his name and those of his family members have reportedly been seized by the agency.

"Pro Kabaddi 2017: Fazel Atrachali playing with dislocated bone, says Gujarat Fortunegiants physiotherapist Olivia Witek","Fazel Atrachali is playing the league with a dislocated bone in his right-hand. Fazel Atrachali is playing the league with a dislocated bone in his right-hand.

Gujarat Fortunegiants may have been dealt a blow after a dream run at home in their debut season of Pro Kabaddi. Their star defender and vice-captain Fazel Atrachali is playing the league with a dislocated bone in his right-hand.

‚ÄúFazel is going through a tough time as he has a dislocated bone in his right hand,‚Äù said Gujarat Fortunegiants chief physiotherapist Olivia Witek. ‚ÄúDuring the match, it hurts him a lot but we are giving him painkillers,‚Äù Olivia said.

When asked about who could be a potential replacement for Fazel if the condition deteriorates, Olivia said, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt put Fazel out of the match. If Fazel is out then the entire team is out. He is one of our key players.‚Äù

In nine matches, Fazel has made 19 successful tackles. While the Iranian has been rock solid in the left corner, he has got support from compatriot Abozar Mighuani. The Fazel-Abozar pair has scored 43 tackle points.

Gujarat will next play U Mumba on August 29 at the NSCI SVP Stadium in Mumbai, giving the 25-year old a well earned seven-day break to recover. ‚ÄúWe at least need one month to completely heal his injury. But with such a tight schedule, we are giving him painkillers and injections whenever there is discomfort,‚Äù she added.

Fazel is the only player in the history of Pro Kabaddi to lift the coveted trophy with two different teams ‚Äì season 2 with U Mumba and season 4 with Patna Pirates.

Gujarat Fortunegiants are the only team in the fifth season, who were unbeaten at home. Their first match at Ahmedabad ended in a win over U Mumba. There after, they went on to register wins over Dabang Delhi, Jaipur Pink Panthers, Bengaluru Bulls and Telugu Titans.

Gujarat Fortunegiants concluded their home leg with a 26-26 draw against Bengal Warriors. They top the Zone A rankings after six wins from nine games.

"Top prosecutor to use new testimony against Michel Temer, source says","Brazil‚Äôs President Michel Temer. (File Photo) Brazil‚Äôs President Michel Temer. (File Photo)

The office of Brazil‚Äôs Prosecutor General plans to use an entrepreneur‚Äôs testimony in a new plea bargain deal to build up an investigation targeting President Michel Temer, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday. The office of the Prosecutor General signed a plea deal with entrepreneur L√∫cio Funaro, who worked for politicians close to Temer, according to the person, who asked for anonymity to detail the terms of the plea deal.

The content of Funaro‚Äôs expected testimonies, which will be taken by prosecutors in coming days, will be used as part of Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot‚Äôs plan to present formal charges against Temer, the person said. Prosecutors in Brazil have been investigating bribes and graft between politicians and private companies in the country‚Äôs worst corruption scandal ever. The probes also helped accelerate the ouster of President Dilma Rousseff a year ago.

Racketeering and obstruction of justice charges against Temer could be presented depending on the strength of the evidence, a source told Reuters earlier this month. Press representatives for Temer did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment. Temer and his legal team have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. A spokeswoman for the office of the Prosecutor General was not immediately available. Funaro‚Äôs lawyer could not be contacted.

On Aug. 2, Temer avoided a trial before the Supreme Court when the lower house of Congress rejected a Janot-pressed bribery charge against him. Janot has repeatedly threatened to bring more corruption charges against the president, related to the latter‚Äôs involvement in a massive corruption scandal known as ‚ÄúOperation Car Wash.‚Äù

Justice Mehtab Gill (retd) Commission in its voluminous interim report submitted to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has recommended compensation in 120 cases by the Investigating Officers(IOs) and not by the state and prosecution of 110 complainants for false complaints against accused.

The Commission also recommended the termination of DSP Gurmeet Singh, who was posted in Sadar Police Station in Khanna in 2007 for instigating a false case against an accused.

Justice Gill Commission was constituted to conduct an inquiry after several number of complaints of cases allegedly due to Akalis excesses. Gill said the Commission would require two years to investigate the rest of the cases. Gill said while recommending the compensation from IOs, he has suggested that the Department of Home and Justice to decide the quantum of compensation in these cases.

Out of total 178 cases, as many as 79 cases were concluded to be false by the Enforcement Department of the Centre. In another 19 cases, the Commission has recommended cancellation of FIR/withdrawal of case against the accused, and has recommended that the Home and Judicial Department should make a request to courts concerned, in a legal and proper manner, to cancel FIRs. In 16 other cases, the courts have held accused to be innocent,

He said the criterion of selecting 178 cases were those in which challan was not presented and courts had acquitted the accused, and those cases which were pending in the judicial courts have not been touched.

After receiving the report, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has asked the home department to examine and implement the recommendations of the interim report of the Justice Gill Commission of Inquiry into false cases in a time-bound manner.

For follow-up action at the district level, the Department of Home may appoint the concerned District Magistrates and the District Attorneys as the Nodal Officers, the Chief Minister further directed in an official order issued soon after receiving the report.

"With experience I am a much better cricketer now, says Dan Christian","Australian all-rounder Dan Christian has earned a recall to the national side. (Source: IPL) Australian all-rounder Dan Christian has earned a recall to the national side. (Source: IPL)

After a successful outing in the IPL this year, Australian all-rounder Dan Christian has earned a recall to the national side. At 34 years of age, Dan Christian is more than happy to earn a recall to the national side.

Speaking to cricket.com.au, he said,‚ÄùI have been a little bit vocal in the past about older guys and how you‚Äôre at your best when you‚Äôre a little bit older, especially if you‚Äôre fit. So it‚Äôs nice to have the opportunity again because I think I‚Äôm a much better cricketer now than what I was when I actually played for Australia. And I reckon most guys around my age would say the same thing.

Christian also spoke about maintaining the fitness at an older age and said, ‚ÄúIf your body is fit and firing, you‚Äôre a more experienced cricketer and you should be able to draw on those experiences a little bit more than you could five or six years earlier. Coming across situations in games, more often than not you‚Äôve been in them before. You draw on what you did well there and what you did poorly and try to do whatever you need to win a game.‚Äù

Admitting that his performance in the IPL, gave hope, Christian said, ‚ÄúBut there was a little bit of hope there based on how the IPL went. And I knew coming before the Ashes with the boys having a fair bit of cricket on, there might be a chance they might rest a few blokes as well (for the India tour). I thought my race was run (at international level) and having a decent IPL has just probably re-opened that door a little bit.‚Äù

West Indies woes revive memories of two-day Headingley horror,"Whereas England victories over the men from the Caribbean have now become commonplace. (Source: AP) Whereas England victories over the men from the Caribbean have now become commonplace. (Source: AP)

Curtly Ambrose was scathing about the West Indies‚Äô ‚Äútotally embarrassing‚Äù defeat by England inside three days during last week‚Äôs first Test at Edgbaston.

But as the three-match series heads to Headingley, where the second Test starts on Friday, it is a reminder the former fast bowler was in a West Indies side beaten inside two days by England at the Leeds ground 17 years ago. In 2000, the teams started the fourth Test of a five-match series at Yorkshire‚Äôs headquarters all square at 1-1.

Whereas England victories over the men from the Caribbean have now become commonplace ‚Äî 2000 was the last time the West Indies won a Test on English soil ‚Äî it was a very different story at the turn of the century.

Prior to the 2000 campaign, which England eventually took 3-1, you had to go back to 1969 for the last time England won a Test series against the West Indies.

If the team of 17 years ago was not as menacing as the one that inflicted successive ‚Äòblackwashes‚Äô on England in the mid-1980s, it still had players of the calibre of Ambrose, fellow fast bowler Courtney Walsh and star batsman Brian Lara.

And yet England managed to produce the first two-day Test win by any side for 54 years ‚Äî and England‚Äôs first since hammering South Africa at Old Trafford in 1912.

What made it even sweeter for the Headingley faithful, who will hope it is an omen for an England team now captained by Yorkshire‚Äôs Joe Root and featuring county colleague Jonny Bairstow, was that several local heroes played key roles in a stunning victory.

Yorkshire all-rounder Craig White took his maiden Test ‚Äòfive for‚Äô in West Indies‚Äô first innings 172.

Hard Test cricket

County colleague Michael Vaughan, the future England captain, made his then Test-best score of 76 in a reply of 272. England were indebted to another Yorkshireman in Darren Gough for sparking a slump that saw the West Indies bowled out for just 61 in 26.2 overs ‚Äî a second-innings slide that makes last week‚Äôs twin collapses in Birmingham look almost tame by comparison.

The fast bowler had Adrian Griffith and Wavell Hinds both out first ball. Their fellow left-hander Lara survived the hat-trick but fell in Gough‚Äôs next over, lbw without playing a shot for the second time in the match.

Andrew Caddick rounded things off with a remarkable spell of five for five in 15 balls, including four wickets in an over, after the Somerset paceman was switched to the Football Stand End (as both fans of Yorkshire and the adjoining Leeds rugby football league club have long called it).

Ridley Jacobs was lbw to the first ball before Caddick shattered the stumps of Nixon McLean, Ambrose and Reon King in four legitimate deliveries. Another eight balls and Caddick had finished the job, bowling Walsh to give England victory by an innings and 39 runs.

Much has changed in the intervening 17 years ‚Äî for example the players and press at Headingley have moved from the Football Stand to the Carnegie Pavilion ‚Äî barely a glint in an architect‚Äôs eye in 2000 ‚Äî at the opposite Kirkstall Lane End.

And yet the post-match comments of West Indies captain Jimmy Adams, now their director of cricket, could, rather worryingly, just as easily have come from current coach Stuart Law.

‚ÄúWe have the fellows who can do the job,‚Äù said senior batsman Adams. ‚ÄúBut a lot of our players are starting their careers and are finding out just how hard Test cricket can be.‚Äù

"Cut Pakistan aid, revoke major non-NATO ally status, say US lawmakers","US President Donald Trump. (File/Photo) US President Donald Trump. (File/Photo)

Hailing Donald Trump‚Äôs new tough line against Pakistan, top US lawmakers have demanded that Islamabad be designated a ‚Äústate sponsor of terrorism‚Äù and its major non-NATO ally status be revoked to force it stop from supporting terrorist groups. President Trump on Tuesday called out Pakistan for supporting terror groups and providing them safe havens within its territory. The criticism came as a part of his speech outlining the new US strategy to end the 16-year war in Afghanistan and bring peace and stability in the larger South Asian region.

‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs speech marked a positive shift in US policy, but it must not be limited only to words. If Pakistan does not stop aiding terrorists with American blood on their hands we must cut all aid to Islamabad, revoke their privileged status as a major non-NATO ally, and designate Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism,‚Äù Congressman Ted Poe said.

He said Trump‚Äôs speech was a rude awakening for Pakistani military and intelligence services, who ‚Äúkeep betraying‚Äù the United States while accepting billions in aid from Washington.

‚ÄúDespite Pakistan‚Äôs ongoing treachery, Islamabad is among the leading recipients of US foreign assistance since 9/11 and is praised in some quarters of the US government as a ‚Äòvital‚Äô ally. This must stop ‚Äì if we want to stabilise Afghanistan, we must deal first with Pakistan,‚Äù he said.

Poe has a legislation pending in the US Congress that calls for designating Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism and revoking its major non-NATO ally status.

Congressman Kevin Cramer, too, applauded Trump for applying pressure on Pakistan.

‚ÄúWhile Pakistan is an important partner in helping keep the peace, it‚Äôs time they take decisive action to make clear they do not support terrorist regimes in the region,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe announcement that the Trump administration plans to increase cooperation with India couldn‚Äôt come at a better time,‚Äù Cramer said.

Congressman Drew Ferguson tweeted: ‚ÄúWe must focus on removing terrorists safe havens and holding our partners in Pakistan to account.‚Äù

Senator John Cornyn, co-Chair of the Senate Indian Caucus, rued that the previous administration of Barack Obama never held Pakistan accountable for providing sanctuary to terrorists.

Congressman Tom Graves said Trump‚Äôs plan for Afghanistan and South Asia will eliminate terrorist safe havens and give US troops more freedom to pursue the enemy, hold Pakistan accountable and bring focus to the diplomatic strategy.

In his speech, Trump did not give any specifics on increasing troops or timeline for successfully ending the war. He offered few clear changes, but the new policy moved from a strategy based on timeline to the one based on conditions.

Coons said it uses a regional approach to challenge Pakistan‚Äôs troubling practice of harbouring extremist groups.

‚ÄúEssentially, without committing to troop levels or timelines, President Trump has said our strategy is to outlast the Taliban and other terrorist groups, and to only leave Afghanistan once the Afghan government and its armed forces can maintain control of the country.

‚ÄúThis strategy would commit us and our allies to a very long and likely very costly war for many years to come, and deserves to be fully debated and developed now that President Trump has presented its broad outlines,‚Äù he said.

Senator Ben Cardin, a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said pressure must be increased on Pakistan to end its support for extremist groups.

"US decision to withhold aid could have negative impact, says Egypt‚Äôs Foreign Ministry","US has decided to stop .7 million in aid to Egypt. US has decided to stop .7 million in aid to Egypt.

Egypt expressed its regret on Wednesday over a United States decision to deny it $95.7 million in aid and to delay a further $195 million, adding that it may have a negative impact on common

interests, its Foreign Ministry said.

Two US sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday the decision came because of Egypt‚Äôs failure to make progress on respecting human rights and democratic norms.

‚ÄúEgypt sees this measure as reflecting poor judgement of the strategic relationship that ties the two countries over long decades and as adopting a view that lacks an accurate understanding of the importance of supporting Egypt‚Äôs stability,‚Äù the ministry said in a statement.

"After Donald Trump‚Äôs warning, Pakistan says it wants peace in Afghanistan","Highlighting Pakistan‚Äôs sacrifices in the enduring fight against terrorism, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Pakistan has desire to work with the international community to eliminate the menace of terrorism. (File) Highlighting Pakistan‚Äôs sacrifices in the enduring fight against terrorism, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Pakistan has desire to work with the international community to eliminate the menace of terrorism. (File)

Pakistan on Tuesday said that it wants peace in Afghanistan and pledged to work to eliminate terrorism, hours after US President Donald Trump‚Äôs stern warning to Islamabad over providing safe havens to terrorists.

A Foreign Office spokesman said US Ambassador David Hale met Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif this afternoon and briefed him about President Trump‚Äôs latest statement on the US policy review on South Asia and Afghanistan. ‚ÄúThe Foreign Minister reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs perspective and desire for peace and stability in Afghanistan,‚Äù said the carefully worded statement from the Foreign Office.

Highlighting Pakistan‚Äôs sacrifices in the enduring fight against terrorism, Foreign Minister Asif underlined Pakistan‚Äôs continued desire to work with the international community to eliminate the menace of terrorism.

Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to announce his Afghanistan and South Asia policy, hit out at Pakistan for providing safe havens to ‚Äúagents of chaos‚Äù that kill Americans in Afghanistan and warned Islamabad that it has ‚Äúmuch to lose‚Äù by harbouring terrorists.

He also slammed Pakistan for its support to terror groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so.

During his meeting, Asif said that he had accepted US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson‚Äôs invitation to visit the US and looked forward to his early interactions in Washington.

Hale conveyed that Tillerson looked forward to meeting the foreign minister in the next few days to have an in-depth discussion on the state of play in the bilateral relationship as well as the new US policy on South Asia.

"Ram Rahim verdict: ‚ÄòMessage should be no lawless activity will be tolerated else you will be hammered,‚Äô says ex-UP DGP Prakash Singh","Gurmeet Ram Rahim rape case verdict: Rapid Action Force along with Chandigarh Police carried out a flag march outside the Chandigarh railway station ahead of the verdict. Express Photo by Sahil Walia Gurmeet Ram Rahim rape case verdict: Rapid Action Force along with Chandigarh Police carried out a flag march outside the Chandigarh railway station ahead of the verdict. Express Photo by Sahil Walia

Former DGP of UP Police, Prakash Singh, who headed a committee to probe lapses during 2016 Jat agitation, has said that a clear message has to be delivered by Haryana Police to the Dera Sacha Sauda supporters gathered in Panchkula that if they indulge in any lawless activity ‚Äúit will not be tolerated and we will hammer you‚Äù.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Prakash Singh said clear directions from the political establishment of the state must be given to handle the situation and police leadership should deal with a firm hand. He said that while gathering of large number of people who have not declared any violent intentions cannot be prevented yet a firm message could be given to them not to indulge in wrongdoing.

‚ÄúGroups of people coming to a place cannot be prevented unless they have declared their objective to be disruptive. Legally speaking, given the chaotic democracy we have, they cannot be prevented. But you can be certainly very firm with them and tell them that any lawless activity will not be tolerated and if it happens we are going to hammer you,‚Äù he said.

When asked if the situation seemed to be heading the way that Jat agitation had in February 2016, Prakash Singh said different degrees of lapses took place at the time. ‚ÄúThere was involvement of police, connivance, abdication of duty and hesitation too. There were different shades of lapses found at different places,‚Äù he said.

Prakash Singh said the problem was that ‚Äúeverybody becomes populist‚Äù, takes populist stance and the police is always on the defensive. ‚ÄúThey know they can use force to disperse them but in the process if four-five people get killed who will defend them. The government should give a clear message that law and order has to be maintained at all costs. They should call SHOs, DSPs, Sps and DCs and convey this to them that whatever legitimate action you take you shall be defended,‚Äù he said.

Meanwhile, fearing a repeat of the situation which developed during the Jat agitation in February 2016, senior police officials in Punjab and Chandigarh have expressed their surprise on Haryana Police having allowed a large influx of supporters of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in Panchkula.

‚ÄúThese supporters should have been contained well before they reached the tri-city area. Ideally they should have been stopped well before coming close to Panchkula in places like Ambala, Karnal or Kurukshetra,‚Äù a senior police official said.

Another senior police official said that arson and damage to private property like the Jat agitation could also not be ruled out because of the large number of persons in town. ‚ÄúIt is not necessary that the dera followers will indulge in any untoward incident. But there may be anti-social elements who would take advantage of the situation and try to spark of violence,‚Äù another officer said.

A senior Army officer who handled the Army‚Äôs Western Command‚Äôs response to the Jat agitation by deploying military columns in Haryana said that it was a mistake on part of the district administration to have allowed such a large number of persons to assemble in the town. ‚ÄúThese should have been stopped from entering the city. Now there is every chance that private property will be damaged and the situation may spiral out of control for a period of time like it happened in 2016,‚Äù he said.

Commenting on a delayed response by the civil administration during Jat agitation, the inquiry report submitted by Parkash Singh had found that there was no direction from the senior-most officials. The report had said that a number of officers subscribed to the ‚Äúphilosophy of chedogey to badhega‚Äù, arguing that taking action against the rioters would have led to graver consequences.

His report had also criticised the administrative paralysis that gripped Haryana during the riots that claimed 30 lives, saying the ‚Äúhighest functionaries‚Äù in the government failed to show ‚Äúthe kind of guidance, direction and control‚Äù that is expected in a crisis of such proportions. It indicted 90 police and administrative officers for their failure to act.

Lewis Hamilton needs to step up in his 200th race,"A fifth victory of 2017 for the Briton would put the pressure back on Ferrari‚Äôs Vettel and Hamilton can celebrate another milestone by bagging pole position on Saturday. (Source: AP) A fifth victory of 2017 for the Briton would put the pressure back on Ferrari‚Äôs Vettel and Hamilton can celebrate another milestone by bagging pole position on Saturday. (Source: AP)

Lewis Hamilton will start the 200th grand prix of his Formula One career in Belgium this weekend but the triple world champion has smaller but more significant numbers on his mind.

Refreshed from an August break in the Caribbean, including a trip to Cuba in his role as UNICEF ambassador, the Mercedes driver is 14 points behind championship leader Sebastian Vettel as he revs up for the second half of the season.

A fifth victory of 2017 for the Briton would put the pressure back on Ferrari‚Äôs Vettel and Hamilton can celebrate another milestone by bagging pole position on Saturday at the long and fast Spa-Francorchamps circuit.

That would see Hamilton, who sportingly relinquished third place to team mate Valtteri Bottas in Hungary before the summer shutdown, match the record of 68 poles set by Michael Schumacher with Ferrari in 2006.

Mercedes have won the last two Belgian Grands Prix, with now-retired 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg triumphant from pole last year after Hamilton won in 2015.

Nobody will be taking anything for granted, however, after Ferrari‚Äôs one-two win in Budapest at the end of July.

‚ÄúOn paper, people will assume that Spa should suit our car because it is a circuit where aerodynamic efficiency is extremely important,‚Äù Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said.

‚ÄúBut assumptions are dangerous ‚Äî we have seen too many times already this season that the form book can be rewritten from one weekend to the next. So we will be making no assumptions.‚Äù

Hamilton has won twice before at Spa, as has Vettel, but the track ‚Äî a classic blast from the past ‚Äî has not been particularly kind to him.

In 2008, when he won his first title, the Briton was demoted from first to third after the race for cutting a chicane, with then Ferrari rival Felipe Massa savouring victory instead.

Spa can often be a lottery, with its capricious weather, and rain could be a boon for Red Bull‚Äôs Belgian-born Dutch teenager Max Verstappen, who can count on plenty of local support in what amounts to a home race.

‚ÄúI just love the track and it‚Äôll be nice seeing so many orange (Dutch) fans in the grandstands,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSpa is my favourite track of the year. You have to get everything right but when you get a good lap it‚Äôs very rewarding.‚Äù

Belgium could also be good for Ferrari‚Äôs Kimi Raikkonen, who arrives with a new contract for 2018 in his pocket.

The fearless Finnish ‚ÄòIceman‚Äô has won four times at Spa but will need to be beyond the reach of Ferrari ‚Äòteam orders‚Äô if he is to do it again.

‚ÄúFor sure there are some circuits that fit us better,‚Äù Raikkonen, whose last Belgian win in 2009 was also Ferrari‚Äôs most recent at Spa, said in Hungary.

‚ÄúThe Mercedes has better horsepower but it depends on so many things. ‚ÄúIf you purely look now, you would say it‚Äôs not going to be as easy for us as here (Hungary) but obviously we try to improve and we are going to do our best.‚Äù

Sunday‚Äôs race, the 50th world championship Grand Prix held at Spa, will also see a Belgian competing ‚Äî McLaren rookie Stoffel Vandoorne ‚Äî for the first time since Jerome d‚ÄôAmbrosio in 2012.

"Cambodia orders US NGO to close, expels foreign staff","Cambodia‚Äôs Prime Minister Hun Sen (AP Photo/File) Cambodia‚Äôs Prime Minister Hun Sen (AP Photo/File)

Cambodia on Wednesday closed a prominent American NGO and ordered its foreign staff to leave the country, the latest salvo by Prime Minister Hun Sen against perceived critics before a general election next year. The order comes a day after the strongman premier threatened the Cambodia Daily, one of the country‚Äôs few remaining critical newspapers, with closure over an alleged unpaid tax bill of USD 6.3 million, calling them ‚Äúthieves‚Äù.

In a statement today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said foreign employees of the National Democratic Institute (NDI) have seven days to leave after the group allegedly failed to formally register or pay correct taxes.

‚ÄúAuthorities are geared up to take the same measures against any foreign association or non-government organisation that fails to abide‚Äù by Cambodia‚Äôs laws, the statement added.

In recent weeks a string of foreign-funded organisations including the NDI have been named in Cambodia‚Äôs pro-government press or by officials as facing tax or regulatory probes.

Analysts say the cascade of legal cases is straight from the political playbook of Hun Sen, who has cornered opponents throughout his three-decade rule, in the run-up to elections.

Cambodians are due to go to the polls in just under a year, in a poll many expect to be a close-run affair.

Apart from the Cambodia Daily, which is owned by an American, the US-funded Radio Free Asia and Voice of America have also been legally targeted.

All have denied wrongdoing and said they are being selected for their independent reporting.

In a statement the Overseas Press Club of Cambodia said the Cambodia Daily ‚Äúhas a history of running stories that have angered the government, leading many to believe the tax department is being used to target critics‚Äù before the poll. The NDI, which says it works to strengthen democratic institutions worldwide, has been operating in Cambodia since 1992.

In recent weeks, pro-government media have accused the organisation of helping Cambodia‚Äôs opposition party to try to topple the government. The NDI, chaired by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

But they have previously declared themselves as ‚Äústrictly non-partisan‚Äù, adding they also trained many members of Hun Sen‚Äôs ruling party. To supporters Hun Sen, one of the world‚Äôs longest serving leaders, has brought growth and stability to an impoverished country ravaged by decades of war.

But critics say corruption, inequality and rights abuses have also flourished. In recent years he has grown closer to China while criticising the US, one of Cambodia‚Äôs largest donors. In 2015 the government passed a broadly-worded law regulating NGOs. Critics warned the legislation would make it much easier to shutter organisations deemed critical of the government. Impoverished Cambodia is home to some 5,000 NGOs.

Right to terminate life falls in zone of right to privacy: Supreme Court,"Supreme Court of India Supreme Court of India

An individual‚Äôs right to refuse life-prolonging medical treatment or terminate life is a freedom which fall within the zone of right to privacy, the Supreme Court said today. Similarly, tapping of telephones and internet hacking of personal data is another area which falls within the realm of privacy, it said.

Justice J Chelameswar, who wrote a separate but concurring judgement, also touched upon other aspects like consumption of food and a woman‚Äôs freedom of choice on whether to terminate pregnancy. ‚ÄúConcerns of privacy arise when the state seeks to intrude into the body of subjects. Corporeal punishments were not unknown to India, their abolition is of a recent vintage. Forced feeding of certain persons by the state raises concerns of privacy.

‚ÄúAn individual‚Äôs rights to refuse life-prolonging medical treatment or terminate his life is another freedom which fall within the zone of the right of privacy,‚Äù Justice Chelameswar said in his 44-page verdict. He, however, said he was ‚Äúconscious of the fact‚Äù that this issue was pending before the apex court.

The Supreme Court recently termed as ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù the issue of right to have a ‚Äúliving will‚Äù to refuse life support in the last days of an ailing person by declining to adjudicate it and leaving it for the government to take a call.

‚ÄúA woman‚Äôs freedom of choice whether to bear a child or abort her pregnancy are areas which fall in the realm of privacy,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI do not think that anybody would like to be told by the State as to what they should eat or how they should dress or whom they should be associated with either in their personal, social or political life,‚Äù Justice Chelameswar said.

He apparently referred to the Aadhaar scheme in which biometric data of individuals is collected by the government. ‚ÄúTelephone tappings and internet hacking by the State of personal data is another area which falls within the realm of privacy. The instant reference arises out of such an attempt by the Union of India to collect biometric data regarding all the residents of this country,‚Äù he said.

He cited various examples and observed that the decision-making process regarding the freedom of association, travel and residence were purely private and fell within the realm of right of privacy.

‚ÄúAll liberal democracies believe that the State should not have unqualified authority to intrude into certain aspects of human life and that the authority should be limited by parameters constitutionally fixed,‚Äù Justice Chelameswar said.

Insofar as religious beliefs are concerned, he said that ‚Äúa good deal of the misery our species suffer owes its existence to and centres around competing claims of the right to propagate religion‚Äù. He said fundamental rights were the only ‚Äúconstitutional firewall‚Äù to prevent the government‚Äôs interference with those core freedoms constituting liberty of a human being.

‚ÄúThe right to privacy is certainly one of the core freedoms which is to be defended. It is part of liberty within the meaning of that expression in Article 21 (the Right to Life and Personal Liberty of the Constitution),‚Äù Justice Chelameswar said.

He also made it clear that no legal right, including right to privacy, could be absolute. ‚ÄúEvery right has limitations. This aspect of the matter is conceded to at the bar. Therefore, even a fundamental right to privacy has limitations. The limitations are to be identified on a case to case basis depending upon the nature of the privacy interest claimed,‚Äù he said.

He also referred to the importance of the Constitution and said it could not be seen as a document written to replace one legal regime by another. ‚ÄúIt is a politically sacred instrument created by men and women who risked lives and sacrificed their liberties to fight alien rulers and secured freedom for our people, not only of their generation but generations to follow,‚Äù Justice Chelameswar said.

A nine-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar has unanimously ruled that ‚Äúright to privacy is an intrinsic part of Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21 and entire Part III of the Constitution‚Äù.

Tamannaah Bhatia‚Äôs tassel blouse is the weirdest thing you will see today,"Tamannaah Bhatia‚Äôs style quotient is a mix of the good and the bad, not ugly though. (Source: File photo) Tamannaah Bhatia‚Äôs style quotient is a mix of the good and the bad, not ugly though. (Source: File photo)

Tamannaah Bhatia is not particularly known for giving us fashion goals but she has managed to grab our attention from time to time, for good reasons, of course. But this time, the Baahubali actor made us sit up and take notice while in New York for wearing one of the most weird blouses ever! The outfit which she picked up from Akanksha Gajria included a tassel details, striped blouse in peach and teal and a tie-dye silk skirt. While we like the skirt, we feel the blouse ruined the entire look.

First, given the unusual colours, the round neck design, especially the patch of pink around her neck and shoulders look out of place, and second, the striped tassels make the entire outfit look simply tacky. We feel it is one of her worst looks ever, given that her make-up wasn‚Äôt on point as well.

The concealer used to hide her dark circles wasn‚Äôt effective and she kind of looked pale here, coupled with the sleek updo.

We spotted another look of Bhatia which didn‚Äôt go down well with us. The white polka dot jumpsuit with the corset style bodice from Saaksha & Kinnie paired with the longline cape looks odd and the addition of the statement silver necklace from Amrapali Jewels does not help either.

She could have easily done away with both, pull her hair up in a wavy ponytail and complemented her outfit with statement earrings. It would have been nice if celebrity stylist Sanjana Batra would have kept it simple.

Do you like her style quotient? Let us know in the comments below.

Journalist killed in Mexico at least 9th this year,"Alex Chang, a Hueyapan councilman, said Rios died on the way to a hospital in Acayucan. Late Tuesday, the state prosecutor‚Äôs office said it was investigating the killings. Alex Chang, a Hueyapan councilman, said Rios died on the way to a hospital in Acayucan. Late Tuesday, the state prosecutor‚Äôs office said it was investigating the killings.

A newspaper reporter in the Mexican Gulf coast state of Veracruz who was enrolled in a government protection program for journalists was killed Tuesday along with two other men, one of his editors and a journalist advocacy group said.

Candido Rios Vazquez, a crime reporter for the newspaper Diario de Acayucan, was at least the ninth journalist slain this year in Mexico.

The State Commission for Attention and Protection of Journalists and Cecilio Perez Cortes, deputy editor at Rios‚Äô newspaper, said the reporter was in the federal government‚Äôs mechanism for protection of journalists and human rights workers.

Perez said Rios had been threatened repeatedly since 2012 by a former mayor of Hueyapan de Ocampo and had a panic button on his cellphone and a security camera at his home. Rios had just finished his work for the day around 3 p.m. and was on his way home, Perez said.

Rios apparently stopped alongside the highway in Hueyapan to speak with a former police inspector he knew who was also killed in the attack, Perez said.

Alex Chang, a Hueyapan councilman, said Rios died on the way to a hospital in Acayucan. Late Tuesday, the state prosecutor‚Äôs office said it was investigating the killings.

Mexico is now the world‚Äôs deadliest country for journalists. The killing of the widely respected journalist Javier Valdez in the western state of Sinaloa in May brought renewed international attention to the issue.

Veracruz has been one of the most deadly Mexican states for journalists in recent years. Rios was the second journalist killed in the state this year. Newspaper columnist Ricardo Monlui was shot to death March 19 as he left a restaurant with his wife in the town of Yanga outside Cordoba.

Rios ‚Äústarted to do journalism because of the social struggle,‚Äù Perez said. ‚ÄúHe always protested against injustice.‚Äù He did not have academic training, but learned on the job, the editor said.

The reporter started his career in a mountainous and largely indigenous area and advocated for farmworkers, women and migrants, Perez said. He founded The Voice of Hueyapan and later joined Diario de Acayucan, where he had worked for 10 years. Perez characterized Rios as ‚Äúcombative‚Äù when it came to causes he believed in.

Acayucan and surrounding towns are largely controlled by organized crime, making it a difficult place to do journalism, Perez said.

‚ÄúWe constantly receive threats,‚Äù he said.

In a short audio message that Rios sent to Perez on Tuesday afternoon, Rios shouts to his boss over loud music about someone being wounded in a neighborhood. A minor story, Perez said. Rios signed off with: ‚ÄúMay God take care of me. Good luck.‚Äù

"Punjab, Haryana on edge ahead of verdict on Ram Rahim in rape case","Dera followers camp near the Panchkula district court on Wednesday. Jaipal Singh Dera followers camp near the Panchkula district court on Wednesday. Jaipal Singh

Punjab and Haryana were put on maximum alert on Wednesday, ahead of the scheduled verdict on August 25 by a CBI court in Panchkula in a rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim. More than one lakh dera followers are already camping in Panchkula in a show of strength and solidarity with Gurmeet Ram Rahim and thousands more have been streaming in from across Punjab and Haryana.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has ordered withdrawal of 1,000 police personnel from VVIP security for on-field duty to strengthen the security blanket. The decision was announced by the CM during a review meeting of the law and order situation attended by DGP Suresh Arora and other police officers.

Both Punjab and Haryana governments are also in touch with the Army for assistance to maintain law and order, if required. In Punjab, a total of 85 companies of central paramilitary forces along with thousands of policemen on the ground will maintain a tight vigil, especially in the Malwa region where the Dera has a huge following in the districts of Moga, Bathinda, Sangrur, Barnala, Patiala and Ludhiana. Flag marches were held in many districts.

Amarinder Singh spoke to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, seeking an additional 10 companies of paramilitary after its earlier request for 75 companies. Haryana, hit last year by the Jat agitation violence and the 2014 stand-off at the Sant Rampal dera, is also making preparations on a war footing, with 36 companies of paramilitary already deployed and eight more on the way. Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Ram Niwas said an additional force of 2,500 police personnel from‚Äúinternal sources‚Äù has been mobilised. Also, 2000 Home Guard volunteers have been called up for duty.

In Panchkula, six companies of paramilitary and 5,000 personnel from Haryana armed police batallions are spread over the town, most of them guarding the district court complex where the CBI court sits, to prevent dera followers from entering it. In Chandigarh, as many as 6,000 policemen have been deployed, along with 10 paramilitary companies. The Punjab government has ordered all schools and colleges to remain shut on August 25. Prohibitory orders have been imposed in Punjab, said a statement by the government. Prohibitory orders have also been issued for all districts of Haryana.

Panchkula schools were ordered closed from August 23 and will reopen on August 28. Universities and colleges in several districts will remain closed on August 25. The Haryana government has also declared a gazetted holiday for offices in Panchkula on Friday. Roadways buses will remain off road for most of Friday. The suspension of mobile Internet services is also being considered.

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar met Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki late on Wednesday to brief him about the situation, said Amit Arya, media adviser to Khattar. In Punjab, a complete ban has been issued on carrying of firearms, with orders to shut down private gun houses selling arms and ammunition to licence holders. Amid intelligence reports of dera followers stocking petrol and arms at the Dera‚Äôs Naam Charcha Ghars, restrictions have been placed on sale of fuel in bottles and cans.

Thailand‚Äôs ex-PM Yingluck Shinawatra tells supporters to stay home ahead of verdict,"‚ÄúI want all of you to give me support by staying home and monitoring the news to avoid any risk of an unexpected incident by people with ill-intention against the country and us,‚Äù Yingluck Shinawatra wrote in her Facebook post. ‚ÄúI want all of you to give me support by staying home and monitoring the news to avoid any risk of an unexpected incident by people with ill-intention against the country and us,‚Äù Yingluck Shinawatra wrote in her Facebook post.

Ousted Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra told supporters not to gather outside the country‚Äôs top court tomorrow when it rules whether she is guilty of negligence. Thailand‚Äôs first female prime minister, toppled by a military coup in 2014, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted and a life ban from politics under the new military-drafted constitution.

Thousands of supporters were expected to turn up outside the Supreme Court in northern Bangkok for the ruling, raising the spectre of confrontations with the police. The junta said it would mobilise more than 4,000 police and army officers to surround the court and warned against mass demonstrations.

In a Facebook post on Thursday, Yingluck told supporters to stay home, fearing people with ‚Äúill-intentions‚Äù might try and cause trouble for their movement. ‚ÄúI want all of you to give me support by staying home and monitoring the news to avoid any risk of an unexpected incident by people with ill-intention against the country and us,‚Äù she wrote.

Yingluck is on trial over her administration‚Äôs rice subsidy scheme which paid farmers nearly twice the market rate for their crop.

Her previous court appearances have seen increasingly large crowds gather outside the court, showering her with roses and chanting ‚Äî a rare sight in a nation where political gatherings remain outlawed.

The subsidy scheme handed billions of dollars to her rural voter base but also allegedly led to massive graft and huge stockpiles of unsold rice. The policy helped spark months of street protests in 2013-14 that called for and eventually secured the overthrow of her government.

Throughout her trial Yingluck defended the scheme, saying she acted in good faith to raise the incomes of the poorest and was the victim of ‚Äúa subtle political game‚Äù.

The military and prosecutors say she must take personal responsibility for the scheme, in an unprecedented move to punish a Thai leader for a policy.

Analysts say the junta and its establishment allies are bent on crushing the political machine led by Yingluck and her billionaire brother Thaksin Shinawatra, who was himself ousted in a 2006 coup. The siblings are beloved in Thailand‚Äôs poor northeast but loathed by Bangkok‚Äôs traditional elite, who have hit their governments with coups or court rulings.

Lemons were status symbol in ancient Rome,"The first remains of the earliest lemon, found in the Roman Forum, date to right around the time of Jesus Christ, the end of the first century BC and early first century AD. (Source: Thinkstock Images) The first remains of the earliest lemon, found in the Roman Forum, date to right around the time of Jesus Christ, the end of the first century BC and early first century AD. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Lemons were status symbols for the ancient Roman ruling elite, according to a study which found that they were the first fruits to arrive in the Mediterranean around the time of Jesus. Researchers from Tel Aviv University in Israel studied a collection of ancient texts, art, artifacts and plant remains such as fossil pollen grains, charcoals, seeds.

Until the first century AD, the only citrus produce available to the ancient Romans were the extremely rare and inordinately expensive citrons and lemons, they said. ‚ÄúToday, citrus orchards are a major component of the Mediterranean landscape and one of the most important

cultivated fruits in the region. But citrus is not native to the Mediterranean Basin and originated in Southeast Asia,‚Äù said Dafna Langgut, from Tel Aviv University in Israel.

‚ÄúMy findings show that citrons and lemons were the first citrus fruits to arrive in the Mediterranean and were status symbols for the elite,‚Äù Langgut said. ‚ÄúAll other citrus fruits most probably spread more than a millennium later for economic reasons,‚Äù she added.

At first, Romans only had access to rough-skinned citrons, also known as etrogim ‚Äì mostly rind and dry, tasteless flesh. The citron arrived in Rome from what is now Israel. The earliest botanical remains of the citron were identified in a Persian royal garden near Jerusalem and dated to the 5th-4th centuries BC. It is presumed that it spread from there to other locations around the Mediterranean, researchers said.

‚ÄúThe first remains of the earliest lemon, found in the Roman Forum, date to right around the time of Jesus Christ, the end of the first century BC and early first century AD,‚Äù said Langgut. It appears that the citron was considered a valuable commodity due to its healing qualities, symbolic use, pleasant odour and rarity, researchers said.

Only the rich could have afforded it. Its spread therefore was helped more by its high social status, its significance in religion and its unique features, rather than its culinary qualities, they said. Sour oranges, limes and pomelos were introduced to the West by Muslim traders via Sicily and the Iberian Peninsula much later, in the 10th century AD, Langgut said. ‚ÄúIt is clear that Muslim traders played a crucial role in the dispersal of cultivated citrus in Northern Africa and Southern Europe,‚Äù Langgut said.

Researchers found that the sweet orange associated with Israel today only dates as far back as the 15th century and was the product of a trade route established by the Genoese and, later, the Portuguese. The sticky-sweet mandarin was introduced to the Mediterranean in the beginning of the 19th century, they said. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt until the 15th century that the sweet orange arrived on European tables. By the time mandarins appeared in the 19th century, citrus fruits were considered commonplace.

They were cash crops rather than luxury items,‚Äù said Lanngut. The study was published in the journal HortScience.

Liverpool‚Äôs appearance in the Champions League will go a long way towards helping the Premier League club attract quality players, manager Juergen Klopp said.

Liverpool beat Hoffenheim 4-2 in the second leg of their Champions League playoff on Wednesday, overcoming the German side 6-3 on aggregate to seal a spot in the group stage of Europe‚Äôs elite competition for the first time since 2014.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big influence on the transfer market, especially if we do it more often,‚Äù Klopp said in his post-match conference. ‚ÄúIf you talk to a player, they really often (mention it)‚Ä¶ especially players we talk to. We don‚Äôt have to talk to players which are not better than our players because it‚Äôs difficult to find.‚Äù

The Merseyside club‚Äôs most significant signing so far this window has been Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah, who joined from Italy‚Äôs AS Roma in June. Liverpool have also added defender Andrew Robertson and striker Dominic Solanke to their ranks.

Klopp believes that Champions League participation has two major benefits as elite players, who often choose clubs based on their engagement in the tournament, will now be open to a move to Liverpool and also allows the club to retain key players.

‚ÄúI know a few people think differently, but we do a lot of work‚Ä¶ if you talk to them, they say if you would play in the Champions League, it would be really interesting because the club is great, the manager is not too bad‚Ä¶‚Äù Klopp added.

‚ÄúIf you try to extend a contract with a player, (they might say), ‚ÄòYeah, I want to play Champions League‚Äô and I always think ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs your job to do it with us together, so don‚Äôt ask that we do a job and you cannot play Champions League‚Ä¶‚Äô ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what this team did, and that‚Äôs why I am so happy about it.‚Äù

Liverpool‚Äôs three opponents in the group stage will be announced on Thursday. Klopp‚Äôs side now turn their attention to the Premier League, where they host Arsenal on Sunday.

Swine flu: ‚ÄòMake lab tests available to non-hospitalised patients‚Äô,"Till recently, only samples of hospitalised and critically ill patients were tested for H1N1 virus (swine flu). However, with as many as 4,350 cases and 449 deaths being reported across the state, private laboratories on Wednesday made a strong case for making such tests available to non-hospitalised patients with suspected H1N1 symptoms, too.

Initially, Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) was the sole laboratory, which was testing throat swab samples to confirm the H1N1 virus.

However, with the increasing number of patients, the state designated as many as 23 laboratories, such as SRL, Golwilkar, among others, to perform the tests.

According to the government guidelines, the samples of ‚ÄòC‚Äô category patients, who were critical and hospitalised, were required to be tested.

Recently, laboratories under Bombay and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations also started testing samples that were referred by clinicians to patients showing H1N1 symptoms and on whom the line of treatment using other antibiotics had failed.

Dr M S Diggikar, acting joint director of health who was present at the meeting, said, earlier, there were restrictions on the availability of these tests for other category patients.

‚ÄúNow, based on the clinicians‚Äô strong suspicion of H1N1 virus, he or she can recommend that the sample can be tested at a state designated lab. There are eight such laboratories performing these tests in Pune. Laboratories, however, have admitted that they exercised restraint in providing these tests for the category of patients other than those recommended by the government. Today‚Äôs meeting urged that there was a need to provide these tests for persons who had H1N1 symptoms but were not hospitalised,‚Äù she said.

The commercially available test kit is validated by NIV and provided to the laboratories to conduct tests to confirm or rule out the presence of H1N1 virus. Labs also urged the state to bring down the rate of the test, which is approximately Rs 5,200.

Dengue, malaria cases rising

State health authorities said on Wednesday that as many as 718 cases of dengue have been detected since January, with registration of three deaths, two of which were from Pune. Between January and July, 8,255 cases of malaria have been reported, with a majority of them in Greater Mumbai (2,611) and Gadchiroli (2,539). In the PMC areas, 242 cases of dengue have been found positive and the authorities are conducting several surveys to identify breeding sites.

Residents have also started responding. For instance, authorities at the Indrayani international School recently alerted the PMC about the mosquito breeding site near their campus. Principal Nikita Damle also pointed out that the teachers and students were involved in an awareness campaign about the disease.

"US defence chief Jim Mattis in Turkey for talks on Syria, Kurds","Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (AP/File Photo) Defense Secretary Jim Mattis (AP/File Photo)

Pentagon chief Jim Mattis arrived in Ankara on for talks with Turkish leaders expected to focus on Washington‚Äôs arming of a Syrian Kurdish militia, which Turkey views as a terror group, in the fight against Islamic State. Mattis flew in for the one-day visit after stopping in Iraq to review progress in the campaign against IS militants, where he urged coalition partners to prevent other political issues from disrupting the growing momentum against the jihadists.

In Ankara, he will hold talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Defence Minister Nurettin Canikli. Turkey, an important NATO ally of the United States and part of the coalition against IS, is incensed that Washington has been arming the Kurdish Peoples‚Äô Protection Units (YPG) militias in the assault on the jihadists‚Äô stronghold Raqa, in northern Syria.

Turkey regards the YPG as the Syrian affiliate of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK). In May, the Pentagon said it had begun transferring small arms and vehicles to the YPG to support their role as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-Syrian Arab alliance fighting IS. The weapons include AK-47s and small-calibre machine guns. The SDF is currently leading the assault on Raqa, with artillery and air support from US-led coalition forces.

US officials on Tuesday said the grinding fight was the ‚Äúpriority‚Äù in the counter-IS campaign since the fall of Mosul last month, the jihadists‚Äô Iraqi hub. The Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq ‚Äî which is also playing a key role in the fight against IS ‚Äî is planning its own independence referendum in September. Mattis met yesterday with Iraqi Kurdish leader Massud Barzani in Erbil to express US opposition to the referendum.

On the same day, Erdogan vowed Turkey would thwart any attempt by the YPG and its political wing the Democratic Union Party (PYD) to carve out a Kurdish state in northern Syria. ‚ÄúWe do not and will never allow a so-called state to be established by the PYD, YPG in northern Syria,‚Äù Erdogan said. The US is also concerned about warming ties between Iran and Turkey. Iranian armed forces chief General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri visited Turkey last week.

Erdogan on Monday said a joint operation with Iran against Kurdish militants which ‚Äúpose a threat,‚Äù including the PKK, is ‚Äúalways on the agenda.‚Äù Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guards, however, denied the claim.

Dutch police question Spaniard after concert cancelled,"People gather at the scene where police are investigating a van with Spanish licence plates containing gas canisters which was found near a Rotterdam venue where a rock concert was cancelled. (Source: Reuters) People gather at the scene where police are investigating a van with Spanish licence plates containing gas canisters which was found near a Rotterdam venue where a rock concert was cancelled. (Source: Reuters)

Dutch police on Thursday questioned a Spanish man detained with gas canisters in a van while driving near a concert venue where a rock concert was cancelled due to a threat of an attack. The man was being held in Rotterdam, where he was stopped in the white vehicle with Spanish licence plates on Wednesday, police said.

Spanish police had tipped the Dutch to potential danger at the venue known as Maassilo where California band Allah-Las was set to play, but a judicial source in Spain told Reuters there was no link to the attacks in Spain last week. ‚ÄúThe investigation is ongoing and we are questioning the man,‚Äù police spokesman Gijs van Nimwegen said.

‚ÄúWe are working to determine his identity.‚Äù The van contained ‚Äúa couple‚Äù of gas canisters and the man‚Äôs driving had been ‚Äúconspicuous‚Äù he said, declining to comment on Spanish police reports he had been drinking alcohol.

The Spanish source said late Wednesday that the tip resulted from an investigation by the Spanish Civil Guard that had been under way for some time and had no direct relation to the two vehicle attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils in Catalonia that killed 15 people.

Rotterdam Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told a news conference late Wednesday it was also not clear whether the threat tip and the detection of the van were connected. He warned against ‚Äúswift conclusions‚Äù while noting the white van had Spanish licence plates and had been flagged for circling near the concert venue.

‚ÄúIt would be wrong at this moment to pile up these facts and conclude ‚Ä¶ there was a plan to attack with gas bottles,‚Äù Aboutaleb said. Spanish news agency Europa Press, quoting Spanish anti-terrorist force sources, reported that the Spaniard arrested in Rotterdam had, in principle, no link to jihadist terrorism. The gas canisters in his vehicle were apparently for domestic use, it said.

Police said the concert was cancelled at around 7 pm, shortly before doors were to be opened for guests. No one was hurt and only one suspect was in custody, Dutch police said.

The National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism‚Äôs office said the threat level in the Netherlands was unchanged at ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù, where it has been since 2013.

"Rory McIlroy to take three-month break, skip European Tour finale","Rory McIlroy took six weeks off after losing in a playoff for the South African Open in January. (Source: AP) Rory McIlroy took six weeks off after losing in a playoff for the South African Open in January. (Source: AP)

Rory McIlroy will have three months off at the end of the year in an effort to get fully healthy and fine-tune his game for 2018, the Northern Irishman said on Wednesday.

Speaking on the eve of the Northern Trust, the first FedExCup playoff event on New York‚Äôs Long Island, McIlroy described it as a rare chance to take an extended break.

The news will disappoint to the European Tour, which will stage its end-of-season Race to Dubai in November without the tour‚Äôs biggest drawcard. But McIlroy, winless in 2017, is eyeing the big picture.

‚ÄúTo have three months I can focus on myself, my health, my game, and just improvement, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ever going to get a chance like this in my career again, where I get this opportunity to re-evaluate things, work on some stuff and just try and improve and get better,‚Äù he told reporters at the Glen Oaks Club in Old Westbury.

‚ÄúI feel it‚Äôs a tremendous opportunity to improve as a golfer and with my health and everything. I‚Äôm excited to play these next few weeks but I‚Äôve already sat down with my team and we have a three-month plan going forward.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting a lot of testing and assessments done 19th and 20th October and then‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll be focusing on getting me in (the) best possible shape with my body and game going into 2018.‚Äù McIlroy, hampered this year with a back injury, said the problem had been more of a hindrance than the 2015 ruptured left ankle ligament than prevented him from defending his British Open crown.

After this month‚Äôs PGA Championship, he said he was thinking of skipping the entire PGA Tour four-event playoff series, but subsequently decided to defend his title, before ending his year at the European Tour‚Äôs Dunhill Links Championship at St. Andrews.

‚Äú(I will) start to hit balls the end of November and then work on some technical stuff and when we get to January hit the ground running and hopefully have an injury free, stress free, very successful year.‚Äù

Four-times major champion McIlroy has not won any of the four biggest tournaments since 2014.

Rex Tillerson sees possible path to North Korea dialogue ‚Äòin near future‚Äô,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to make a peace overture to North Korea on Tuesday, welcoming what he called the restraint it had shown recently in its weapons programs and saying he hoped a path could be opening for dialogue ‚Äúsometime in the near future.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have had no missile launches or provocative acts on the part of North Korea since the unanimous adoption of the U.N. Security Council resolution,‚Äù Tillerson told reporters, referring to U.N. sanctions on North Korea agreed on Aug. 5.

‚ÄúWe hope that this is the beginning of this signal that we‚Äôve been looking for ‚Äì that they are ready to restrain their level of tensions, they‚Äôre ready to restrain their provocative acts, and that perhaps we are seeing our pathway to sometime in the near future having some dialogue,‚Äù Tillerson added.

Tillerson said he was ‚Äúpleased‚Äù Pyongyang had ‚Äúdemonstrated some level of restraint that we‚Äôve not seen in the past.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe need to see more on their part, but I want to acknowledge the steps they‚Äôve taken thus far,‚Äù he said.

Tillerson‚Äôs words appeared aimed at encouraging dialogue, even though the State Department this month said North Korea had ‚Äúa long way to go‚Äù before Washington would consider talks. North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and dozens of missile tests since the start of last year and Washington says the aim of any future talks must be denuclearization, something Pyongyang has rejected as long as the United States maintains a ‚Äúhostile policy‚Äù toward it.

North Korea‚Äôs last missile test was of a second intercontinental ballistic missile on July 28. This put the U.S. mainland in range, prompting heated exchanges of threats and rhetoric that raised fears of a new conflict on the Korean Peninsula. U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month warned North Korea it would face ‚Äúfire and fury‚Äù if it threatened the United States. Pyongyang responded by threatening to fire missiles toward the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam, but later said it was holding off while it waited to see what the United States would do next.

TRUMP‚ÄôS PRAISE

Last week, Trump praised North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for his ‚Äúwise‚Äù decision, while U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had told Russia, Japan, the United States, China and North and South Korea he was available to help broker talks. So-called six-party talks aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program collapsed in 2008 following a North Korean rocket launch, after which Pyongyang said it was pulling out of a 2005 agreement to freeze the program.

In May, North Korea thumbed its nose at Tillerson personally by testing a missile just after the U.S. secretary of state chaired a U.N. Security Council meeting at which he warned that failure to curb Pyongyang‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programs could lead to ‚Äúcatastrophic consequences.‚Äù

Tillerson‚Äôs remarks on Tuesday came just after the United States announced new North Korea-related sanctions targeting Chinese and Russian firms and individuals for supporting Pyongyang‚Äôs weapons programs. China and Russia backed the U.N. sanctions but both countries have urged the United States to enter dialogue with North Korea in return for a freeze in weapons testing.

North Korea‚Äôs envoy to a disarmament conference in Geneva, Ju Yong Chol, reiterated North Korea‚Äôs stance on talks earlier on Tuesday. ‚ÄúAs long as the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear threat remains unchallenged, (North Korea) will never place its self-defensive nuclear deterrence on the negotiating table or step back an inch from the path it took to bolster the national nuclear force,‚Äù he said. Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at Washington‚Äôs Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there was a need for clearer U.S. messaging vis-a-vis North Korea.

‚ÄúI wonder if Kim Jong Un will interpret Tillerson‚Äôs remark as a positive gesture or a challenge to which he will respond with a missile test,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt must be tough for the North Koreans to make sense of all the different signals from the Trump administration. I hope that privately there is clear messaging about what is needed for resumption of dialogue, and what U.S. offers are on the table.‚Äù

Boko Haram use of kids as ‚Äòhuman bombs‚Äô soars in 2017: UN,"The UN estimates the insurgency has displaced 1.7 million people and left an estimated 20,000 people dead since 2009. The UN estimates the insurgency has displaced 1.7 million people and left an estimated 20,000 people dead since 2009.

UNICEF is reporting a fourfold increase in the use of children as ‚Äúhuman bombs‚Äù by the radical Boko Haram group in northeastern Nigeria already this year compared to all of 2016. UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado says she has no explanation for the increase in 83 such ‚Äúhuman bomb‚Äù children, two-thirds of them girls, compared to 19 total children last year.

She said Boko Haram does not always claim responsibility for such attacks typically against civilian targets, but no other groups are known to use the tactic. A side-effect is that ‚Äúmany children who have managed to get away from captivity face rejection when they try to reintegrate into their communities.‚Äù

"Every penny of the treasury wd be spent for development, says Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das","Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das. Express photo by Subham Dutta. Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das. Express photo by Subham Dutta.

Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das on Thursday said that every penny of the treasury would be spent for the development of the people and the state. ‚ÄúEvery penny will be spent on the people and the development of the state. For this ‚ÄòSarkar Aapke Dwar‚Äô programme is being held in every division enablilng direct contact between the government and the people,‚Äù Das told a meeting at Oraiya Tand village of Podayahat block in Godda district.

Calling upon for collective effort in making the state prosperous and self-sufficient, Das said poverty of the rich state should end in five years. He added that the government was working with an aim that there should not be any BPL card holder in a time bound manner.

Within one year, people of 17 districts, 68 blocks and one thousand panchayats would have jobs, he said.

Das said that ‚ÄòMukhya Mantri Udyami Board (s)‚Äô were set up and under which 4.80 lakh women would be trained for self-employment.

Barcelona troubles continue as they face away test at Alaves,"Barcelona got off to a winning start by beating Real Betis 2-0 last week. (Source: Reuters) Barcelona got off to a winning start by beating Real Betis 2-0 last week. (Source: Reuters)

Barcelona‚Äôs institutional instability shows no sign of going away after another week of confusion in the transfer market, and the team will need to put on a show of unity in their first away trip of the season against Alaves.

Barca got off to a winning start by beating Real Betis 2-0 last week, although a reported U-turn on signing Ivorian midfielder Jean Michael Seri from Nice leaves them with a weakened squad following the departure of Neymar to Paris St Germain, with moves for Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele far from being completed.

Meanwhile, the Barca board escalated their bitter dispute with Neymar by announcing plans to sue him for 8.5 million euros ($10 million) for breach of contract, the latest sign that the club is still reeling from the sale of one of their top players.

Reported divisions between the club‚Äôs hierarchy and players appeared to be highlighted by Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique posting pictures on social media welcoming the Brazilian back to the city during the week, which has been viewed in the Spanish media as a thinly veiled attempt to show they are on the side of their former teammate.

Meanwhile, Messi has still not signed the contract he agreed with the club in July and captain Andres Iniesta has said his future at the club is uncertain.

In the midst of this instability, Barca travel to Alaves, who beat them 2-1 at the Nou Camp last year in a shock result.

The Catalans hammered the Basque side 6-0 away and beat them 3-1 in the King‚Äôs Cup final, but are still without injured striker Luis Suarez, although Iniesta could return.

Alaves lost 1-0 to Leganes in their opening game, although defender Rodrigo Ely hopes they can capitalise on Barca‚Äôs troubles by extending their strong record at their Mendizorrotza stadium, where they only lost four times last campaign.

‚ÄúBarcelona are in a new process and have to improve but at home Alaves are difficult to beat,‚Äù Ely told reporters.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very difficult game against one of the best teams in the world but we‚Äôll try and take points away from them. We will fight and compete like we did last year against teams that have more quality than us.‚Äù

Champions Real Madrid showed their class with a 3-0 win at Deportivo La Coruna last week without Cristiano Ronaldo through suspension, and will still be shorn of their Portuguese talisman as well as captain Sergio Ramos against Valencia on Sunday.

Atletico Madrid will be looking to improve on their 2-2 draw with Girona when they visit Las Palmas, but will have to do without forward Antoine Griezmann, who is suspended after being sent off last week.

Long weekend getaways for 2017: Where are you going for Ganesh Chaturthi?,"Everyone needs a holiday, so why not plan ahead for yours. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Everyone needs a holiday, so why not plan ahead for yours. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Did you spend most of last year grumbling about how you didn‚Äôt get to travel much; how work pressure was too much and there wasn‚Äôt any time to take a break? Well then, let that not be an excuse for 2017, because this year has a whole host of long weekends (some you may need to work around, but then what are casual leaves and sick leaves for?) for you to make good use of. So far we‚Äôve identified 14 of them, of which two (in August and October) can give you nine full days of vacation fun if only strategically add a couple of extra days.

We took inspiration from our own travels, added inputs from travel experts from Cleartrip, TravelTriangle, Travkart, Expedia, Skyscanner, etc., to come up with this. Check them out.

Hit the beach by going to Goa or Diu. The weather is perfect for water sports and fun. Love the snow? Then trek up to Auli or Parashar Lake for the weekend. You can even head to Dubai to catch the fag end of the Dubai shopping festival.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to Goa for Mardi Gras, or towards Shimla and Fagu for a relaxing weekend in the hills.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to the hills for some chill time, and to catch a bit of snow if you‚Äôre lucky. Options could include Shimla‚Äôs outskirts or McLeodganj to the north, a hilly trek towards Malshej to the west, or even Puri or Digha in the east.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: 1/2

Where to go: Head to Singapore for some weekend fun. There is much to do and see, and the destination can be covered fairly well over four days.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: 1

Where to go: If you‚Äôre health conscious and a tad bit religious, then you could head towards Rishikesh for a Yoga retreat during this weekend. Or attend the Aoleang festival, held during the first week of April, along with the Konyak tribe in Nagaland.

Total days: 4

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you like nature and a bit of hiking, then head towards McLeodganj or a bit higher up towards Triund. It‚Äôs an easy hike for those who have never trekked before and gives you the most stunning views.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to Orchha for a quick weekend trip, or Pondicherry or Coorg if you‚Äôre in southern India. This a good time to head to these places before summer comes by in full swing.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Head to places that are known for their non-vegetarian and Mughlai fare, such as Hyderabad, Lucknow and Ajmer.

Total days: 9

Extra leaves: 2/3

Where to go: If you take just two leaves, you have nine full days for a mini vacation, and the weather is perfect for a sojourn to Europe. Head to Eastern European countries such as Greece, Croatia, Hungary and Poland. There‚Äôs a lot to cover, and it works well for the budget traveller as well.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you plan really tight, this is the season to head to the Valley of flowers in Uttarakhand for a mini trek, and you can also go up to the Hemkund Sahib gurudwara, which is the highest gurudwara in the world.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: If you‚Äôre really fond of beer, then a quick visit to Munich for the Oktoberfest (on till October 3) may not be a bad idea. This is also a bucket list item for many, so why not! If you‚Äôre around Mumbai, then Karjat may be a viable option or if you want to head towards the North East then Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh is a great option. Though the music festival happens in September, you can always find local pubs with live music and there are, of course, some picturesque hiking trails.

Total days: 9

Extra leaves: 4

Where to go: Nine days is like a mini vacation, so make full use of it. October is a good month for a Vietnam-Cambodia trip, or just one of these countries, if you don‚Äôt want to rush it. Eastern Europe is also a good bet since it would be just before the severe winter sets in. In India, a trek through Spiti valley would give you stunning vistas to gorge upon, or if you haven‚Äôt been to Rajasthan yet, then a road trip is highly recommended.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Dhanaulti, Ranikhet, Mukteshwar, Manali, Binsar and Chakrata are all hill stations that would not only be a refreshing change, but also give stunning views of the snow-capped Himalayas. In southern India, Pondicherry or Kovalam are lovely seaside destinations worth considering.

Total days: 3

Extra leaves: None

Where to go: Let‚Äôs face it, Goa is an obvious choice for this three-day weekend, and that‚Äôs for a reason. But if you‚Äôd rather not hit the crowded streets and beaches, and love snow then Manali and Rohtang Pass could be good options, even Auli is covered in white at this time of the year.

IISER group‚Äôs predictions on Sun‚Äôs corona find ‚Äòqualitative match‚Äô in image,"Path of the Sun during the solar eclipse near Redmond, Oregon, in the US. AP Path of the Sun during the solar eclipse near Redmond, Oregon, in the US. AP

WHEN DIBYENDU Nandi‚Äôs prediction about an intricate structure of the corona found a qualitative match in the observations of Monday‚Äôs solar eclipse, the ones who cheered the most were scientists associated with the Aditya-L1 mission, India‚Äôs first exploratory mission of the Sun that is scheduled to be launched in 2020.

Nandi, who heads the Centre of Excellence in Space Sciences at Indian Institute for Science Education and Research (IISER) in Kolkata, had made predictions about the appearance of the corona during the eclipse and, while data on the raw images is still being analysed carefully, the initial findings show a ‚Äúqualitative match‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe qualitative match between the predicted and observed image is quite satisfactory,‚Äù Dipankar Banerjee, Chair of the Science Group on Visible Emission Line Coronograph (VELC), the main payload on Aditya-L1 mission, told The Indian Express.

Banerjee, an expert on the solar corona at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Bengaluru, said that a detailed comparison can be made once the processed images are available in a few days‚Äô time.

Nandi‚Äôs group had simulated the coronal structures corresponding to the total eclipse time, a few days before August 21, based on a model developed at CESSI-Kolkata prior to August 16, Banerjee said. The Aditya satellite will carry seven scientific payloads.

‚ÄúOne of them is a coronograph that artificially creates a total solar eclipse in space by occulting the emission coming from the solar disk. This payload called VELC will have the ability to measure the magnetic field in the corona along with the topological structure which is very similar to the modelled images of Nandi‚Äôs team. Hence, a direct comparison of the observed image and the models will enable the community to understand the structure of the magnetic corona. This kind of modelling will be very helpful for the Aditya-L1 space mission,‚Äù Banerjee said.

At Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Pune, associate professor Durgesh Tripathi, who is also working on the Aditya-L1 mission, told The Indian Express that the aim was to observe the sun to understand its influence on space environment and earth‚Äôs climate.

‚ÄúThe results from the eclipse are very encouraging for the Indian team and we are very excited. The theoretical, computational models developed indigenously will complement these observations and help us interpret data from the VELC and other instruments on board the Aditya-L1 mission,‚Äù he said.

Nandi‚Äôs team from CESSI had predicted an intricate structure of the corona that is a result of computing the evolution of the magnetic fields of sunspots on the solar surface over many years.

‚ÄúWe are getting close to realistic models of the sun‚Äôs magnetic field, which are otherwise very difficult to measure. We are now in a position to make predictions about the space environment,‚Äù Nandi, who is also an associate at IUCAA, said.

AC Milan CEO Marco Fassone hinted the club has finished its summer spending spree after signing its 11th player in this transfer window: Nikola Kalinic.

Milan signed Kalinic from Fiorentina on a one-year loan deal with the obligation to buy, with the Croatia forward penning a four-year contract on Tuesday to June 30, 2021.

‚ÄúWith Nikola we‚Äôve completed the team,‚Äù Fassone said.

Milan, which was bought by a Chinese-led consortium in April, has spent more than 200 million euros ($234 million) in the offseason, signing players such as Leonardo Bonucci, Andre Silva, Ricardo Rodriguez, Franck Kessie, Andrea Conti, Hakan Calhanoglu, Lucas Biglia and Mateo Musacchio.

‚Äú(Kalinic) is the player we wanted to complete the squad because he has experience and quality,‚Äù Fassono said. ‚ÄúWe always said we wanted to have a mix of young and talented players and experienced ones, to build a spine of experienced players.

‚ÄúWe got Bonucci, we got Biglia, we got Nikola, who completes the squad.‚Äù

Milan was in talks with Fiorentina for the 29-year-old Kalinic from mid-June, and he missed training last week as he attempted to push through the move.

‚ÄúI have to say this has been a long and difficult story, more than two months,‚Äù Fassone said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here because he (Kalinic) wanted to become a Rossonero so strongly. He has a boundless and historic love for our shirt and that‚Äôs what allowed us to unlock this long negotiation that we had with Fiorentina.‚Äù

Kalinic, who also played for Blackburn Rovers in the English Premier League, moved to Italy in 2015 and had 33 goals in 83 appearances for Fiorentina. He said he preferred to do his talking on the pitch.

Kalinic will wear the No. 7 shirt, which was worn by one of Milan‚Äôs best-ever forwards, Andriy Shevchenko.

No financial details were disclosed, but reports say Milan will pay Fiorentina 25 million euros ($29 million) for Kalinic.

Milan, which last won the league in 2011, opened its Serie A campaign with a 3-0 win at Crotone. It also beat Shkendija 6-0 in the Europa League last Thursday.

"Ram Rahim verdict: Anticipation of violence hangs over Dera Sacha Sauda headquarters, spread over 1,000 acres","Gurmeet Ram Rahim Gurmeet Ram Rahim

Thousands of followers congregated at Dera Sacha Sauda headquarters here on Wednesday, two days ahead of the scheduled verdict by a CBI court in Panchkula in a rape case against the dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim.

Spread over 1,000 acres, the dera is a township of its own, with its hotel, cinema hall, cricket stadium, multi-specialty hospital, two schools, sports village, a studio, a printing press where a newspaper is printed, a bio-gas plant, apart from a large chunk of land being used for agriculture purposes.

Nobody can meet the 50-year-old dera chief without a prior, vetted appointment. It is rare for him to meet journalists. The government has provided him Z-category security, plus he has his own.

There is a lot of construction inside the dera. Outside, there is a market of 40 shops being run by dera followers.

‚ÄúWe came here for Guruji, we can do anything for him,‚Äù says Harpal Singh, a labourer, who has arrived from Hijrawan Kalan village of Fatehabad district in Haryana. Harpal, who is from Bazigar caste, a Scheduled Caste community, claimed he left his drinking habit after he became a follower of the dera.

Ikbal Singh (23) is also from a poor Scheduled Caste family from Hakamwala village in Mansa district. ‚ÄúYou know well why we have come here. We are here because of the case against Guruji,‚Äù says the student of Guru Nanak College in Budhlada in Mansa district.

‚ÄúWe all came here in support of Pitaji,‚Äùsaid Gagandeep Kaur (21), who has completed her Bsc in nursing and belongs to a Jatt Sikh family village Mehta in Barnala district, using the honorific by which followers refer to the dera chief. ‚ÄúHe is being harassed without any reasons,‚Äù she said.

A dera follower deployed outside the dera said, ‚ÄúThey (government authorities) should not make a mistake by equating us with Rampal (another sect head). They should understand we have support from all communities.‚Äù

There is an anticipation of violence hanging over the dera. While many followers are engaged in daily chores at the langar or transporting material in tractors to secure the fort-like dera, several hundred followers were gathered under a large pandal in the dera.

Over the mike, someone is chanting ‚ÄúDhan-Dhan Satguru-Tera Hi Asra‚Äù, and saying that all were ready to go to Panchkula in support of their 50-year-old guru.

A dera functionary told The Indian Express that ‚Äúthe premis (dera followers) can do anything in case of any adverse outcome in the case‚Äù. But officially, the dera management chooses its words carefully. ‚ÄúPeople are angry because of whatever have happened in the past with us. It is difficult to control emotions of anybody,‚Äù said dera spokesperson Dr Dilawar Singh.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt say anything about the allegations against Guruji at this stage. We have been following the judicial process and will continue. The panic has been created by deploying paramilitary forces,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe dera followers have moved to Panchkula after a statement by Haryana Chief Minister that the dera chief would appear before the CBI court there,‚Äù said the dera spokesperson.

Ask the followers individually how they will react if the court convicts their guru, their reply is the same: ‚ÄúHame Majboor Kiya to Kurkshetra ka Maidan Bana Denge‚Äù. In an attempt to prevent violence in Sirsa, Senior Citizen Network Association has launched a campaign in the town to maintain peace. ‚ÄúThere may be innocent youths who can be misguided easily. We are asking them not to indulge in emotional acts,‚Äù says Lal Chand Godara, district unit president of the association and a retired Army man.

Meanwhile, Haryana Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Ram Niwas said that State had got eight additional companies of paramilitary forces and an additional force of 2,500 police personnel from internal sources had also been mobilized for deployment in different parts of the state. About 2,000 Home Guards have been called to join duty to manage crowds and adequate arrangements have been made to deal with any situation in the state. In reply to a question, he said the government would also call in the Army, if necessary, impose curfew according to time and circumstances and initiate all steps required to maintain law and order in the state on August 25 when the court announces its verdict in the case in which the dera chief is accused of raping two of his women followers.

When asked if Dera chief will appear before the court in Panchkula on Friday, a spokesman of Dera Sacha Sauda said the sect and its head had always followed law and will do so in future also. ‚ÄúWe have always followed due process of law, never have we gone out of law‚Äôs purview and never ever will we do so,‚Äù he said.

Asked if Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh will appeal to his followers to help maintain law and order and peace, he said, ‚Äúduring his Satsangs (at sect head in Sirsa) in mornings and evenings, Guru ji always talks about humanity and things which will benefit humanity. He talks about tree plantation, organ donations, blood donation and helping out weaker sections‚Äù.

Felipe Massa cleared for Belgian Grand Prix,"Massa suffered near-fatal head injuries after being hit on the helmet by bouncing debris during qualifying at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009. (Source: Reuters) Massa suffered near-fatal head injuries after being hit on the helmet by bouncing debris during qualifying at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009. (Source: Reuters)

Brazilian driver Felipe Massa has been cleared to compete in this weekend‚Äôs Belgian Grand Prix after he missed the previous race in Hungary at the end of July due to feeling dizzy during practice.

His Williams Formula One team said the 36-year-old had been given the all-clear by the FIA medical delegate following tests at the circuit on Thursday, a standard procedure following injury or sickness.

Massa went to hospital after Friday practice in Budapest but was then passed fit to continue on Saturday, when he experienced more dizziness.

The Brazilian was replaced for qualifying and the race by British reserve Paul di Resta.

The 7km Spa circuit is the longest, and one of the fastest, tracks on the calendar and this year‚Äôs cars will be going quicker through the corners and subjecting the drivers to even more G-forces than before.

Massa suffered near-fatal head injuries after being hit on the helmet by bouncing debris during qualifying at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009. The then-Ferrari driver spent several days in hospital in an induced coma after that incident.

Ashton Agar confident to make Test comeback a success,"Ashton Agar said that he is prepared as a cricketer and it is pleasing to be back. Ashton Agar said that he is prepared as a cricketer and it is pleasing to be back.

Making his comeback to the Australian Test squad after a gap of four years, left-arm spinner Ashton Agar has said that he feels that the time away from the game has made him a better cricketer and he is happy to be back in the team. He is all set to partner Nathan Lyon when Australia begin their two-Test series in Dhaka from August 27.

Agar, who was dropped from the squad after the 2013-14 Ashes series in England, was picked after some strong performances in the domestic circuit and is raring to go in Bangladesh.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just four years of experience,‚Äù Agar said, of the time he spent away from the international circuit. ‚ÄúFour years of extra bowling and naturally you get better the more you bowl. I just learnt the game of cricket over the four years playing for WA. It‚Äôs just a lot of time to learn about myself. I worked on all part of my game and that‚Äôs why I am enjoying,‚Äô he said.

He hogged the limelight after playing a 98-run innings coming in at number 11 in his debut Test against England but failed as a spinner. He now says that he is prepared as a cricketer and it is pleasing to be back.

‚ÄúObviously lot depends on what the wickets look like, but I am ready to go if I get the nod,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm preparing pretty well and I have done everything I can so now I feel like everything is in really good order and now it‚Äôs really pleasing to be around the Test group.

‚ÄúIt is what you want to do and it‚Äôs a great bunch of guys to be here around [with]. So it is good fun,‚Äô he said, adding that he is very optimistic about his chances in the series opener. I am very hopeful. If he[Lehman] said he is going to play two spinners, I am well placed.

‚ÄúI guess the pressure is what you put on yourself. To me, I have to not put too much pressure on myself and go and try and enjoy the game,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúPlay my role in the team and express myself in the middle. I still remain away from all the distractions and all the talks. I did not know that I had a press conference yesterday and that is the way I am doing,‚Äù he added.

Talking about Bangladesh, Agar said that they have met couple of times and Australia are focused on their own work instead of thinking about Bangladesh.

‚ÄúWe had a couple of meetings. Threats‚Ä¶ I am not sure how we look at it. We focus more on ourselves and on our skills and how we can beat them on skills. We have analysed all their players and we do that properly in all our meetings. We are worried bit more on ourselves as we can control that,‚Äù he said.

Traffic was halted, movie screenings interrupted and hundreds of thousands of people across South Korea were directed to underground shelters on Wednesday as part of a civil defence drill to practice in case of an attack by North Korea. But South Koreans are familiar with such preparations, having seen many over the decades since the height of Cold War tension with a neighbour it is still technically at war with, and many people have become inured to the danger.

This time, the government tried to inject some urgency and get more people taking part amid a surge of tension over North Korea‚Äôs weapons programmes, and an exchange of dire warnings of nuclear war by both it and its sworn enemy, the United States. ‚ÄúWe need to practise because we‚Äôre still at war with North Korea and people are insensitive to threats,‚Äù said Hwang Jae-min, a 30-year-old prison guard who happened to be watching a movie at a Seoul cinema complex when a siren heralded the beginning of the drill.

Hwang was one of about 50 moviegoers led underground to take shelter from an imaginary North Korean air raid. The siren sounded around the country and government officials and police flagged down traffic and tried to shepherd pedestrians to the nearest shelters. But sceptics doubted such an orchestrated exercise would be much use if and when it came to a real war. ‚ÄúI do strongly believe we need this drill but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be working properly,‚Äù said Choi In-sook, a 45-year-old housewife strolling down a city street when the siren went off.

She did not run for cover.

‚ÄúIt needs to be performed like it‚Äôs a real war,‚Äù she said. The drill was part of an annual joint military exercise conducted by South Korean and U.S. forces that began on Monday and will run until Aug. 31, and which North Korea denounced as a reckless step toward nuclear war.

North Korea routinely denounces military exercises by U.S. and South Korean forces that it regards as thinly disguised preparations to invade it. South Korea‚Äôs state run television broadcast scenes from the 20-minute drill live for the first time in two years in the hope of drumming up some enthusiasm.

Jung Han-yol, director of the Ministry of Public Affairs and Safety‚Äôs civil defence division, conceded that the fact that participation was voluntary meant the drill might lack some credibility. Cho Won-cheol, emeritus professor of civil and environmental engineering of Yonsei University in Seoul, said there was always a problem with getting people involved in government preparations for a war few people believe will happen.

‚ÄúThe reason why the drill is not working well is the country‚Äôs civil defence drill has always been practiced mostly by the government or civil officials, not by the civilians,‚Äù Cho said. South Korea and is main ally the United States are technically still at war with the North because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Air Marshal delivers lecture on 1971 air war over Bangladesh,"The theme of his talk was Air War over Bangladesh, 1971, and his role as the commanding officer of a Gnat fighter squadron. (Express Archives) The theme of his talk was Air War over Bangladesh, 1971, and his role as the commanding officer of a Gnat fighter squadron. (Express Archives)

Delivering a lecture on the 1971 air war over Bangladesh between India and Pakistan, former commanding-in-chief, Western Air Command, Air Marshal MM Singh, said that the Indian Air Force(IAF) will never enjoy such superiority over its adversaries in the future wars.

He said any lessons learned in the air war to liberate East Pakistan were not really relevant for the future and were mainly of academic and historical interest. He said this while addressing a gathering during the 4th Maj Gen KS Bajwa Memorial ‚Äì Regiment of Artillery War Experience Talk under the auspices of the Centre for Indian Military History. The theme of his talk was Air War over Bangladesh, 1971, and his role as the commanding officer of a Gnat fighter squadron.

Speaking on the order of battle of the respective air forces in the East, he stated that the Indians had a qualitative edge and considerable numerical superiority over Pakistan, which they used to good effect. He then gave a detailed description of the aircraft fielded by both sides with the help of slides including the weapons payload which they were capable of carrying. He also disclosed how a planning team of the IAF visited various unused airstrips as well as civil airports in the East and North-East to discover how best they could be activated for the upcoming war.

‚ÄúIt was not just a fighter and bomber aircraft war. Helicopters and transports played a vital role. The lifting of a brigade by a helicopter over Meghna to strike at the enemy‚Äôs core defence area was the turning point of the war,‚Äù he said. Speaking on the occasion, Mandeep Singh Bajwa, Chairman of the Centre for Indian Military History, informed that the organisation will jointly organise a seminar to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Nathu La-Cho La clashes between the Indian Army and Chinese PLA.

He also said that Centre has been selected to be part of an annual exchange programme on military history talks between the United Service Institution, this country‚Äôs leading military think tank and the United Kingdom. Under this project, next month, Major Tony McClenaghan, the world‚Äôs leading expert on the Indian States Forces will address a talk in Chandigarh, the title of which will be ‚ÄòThe Contribution of the Maharajas to the First World War‚Äô.

THE CENTRE is firming up a cadre policy for IAS, IPS and Indian Forest Service officers wherein they get to choose a zone instead of the current system of a state as their cadre. Aimed at ‚Äúnational integration‚Äù, the new cadre policy will divide the 26 cadres into five zones and new recruits will have to choose from among them, a senior official said.

Zone-I has seven cadre areas ‚Äî AGMUT (also known as Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territories), Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Rajasthan and Haryana. Zone-II consists of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, while Zone-III comprises Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam-Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura and Nagaland will constitute Zone-IV, while Zone-V will have Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Candidates can only select one state/cadre from a zone as their first choice. Their second, third, fourth and fifth choices have to be from different zones. Usually candidates choose their home state as their first choice and neighbouring states as their subsequent preferences.

Candidates appearing for the civil service examination will have to first give their choices in a descending order of preference from among the various zones, as per the new policy. The preference for the zones will remain in the same order and no change will be permitted there, it said. Candidates will get home cadre on the basis of merit, preference and vacancy.

No time table for withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan: US,"Trump‚Äôs remarks come just days after he said it has been decided that the American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically and American troops will ‚Äúfight to win‚Äù.(Source: AP) Trump‚Äôs remarks come just days after he said it has been decided that the American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically and American troops will ‚Äúfight to win‚Äù.(Source: AP)

The US has said there is no time table for withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan with President Donald Trump asserting that America will pursue an ‚Äúhonourable and enduring‚Äù outcome in the war-torn country.

Trump, who ruled out a hasty withdrawal of troops while announcing his Afghanistan and South Asia policy, said in all foreign policy decisions his administration will always put the safety and security of Americans first.

‚ÄúWe will pursue an honourable and enduring outcome in Afghanistan, worthy of the tremendous sacrifice our troops have already made. We will give our men and women in uniform the tools they need and the trust they have earned to fight and to win,‚Äù he told a crowd of veterans at an American Legion conference in Reno, Nevada.

Trump‚Äôs remarks come just days after he said it has been decided that the American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically and American troops will ‚Äúfight to win‚Äù.

Trump, in his first prime-time televised address as commander-in-chief, had also issued the sternest warning yet by an American leader to Pakistan for providing safe havens to terrorists and sought an enhanced role for India in bringing peace in the war-ravaged country.

Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that there was no time table for withdrawal from Afghanistan.

‚ÄúAs the President said many times before, he‚Äôs not going to set a timetable. He‚Äôs looking at not repeating the mistakes of the previous administrations on this front, and going to rely heavily on the generals and the folks on the ground and the conditions to determine when the right time is to remove from Afghanistan,‚Äù she said in response to a question.

Any announcement on the troop level increase in Afghanistan would be made by the Department of Defence, she said.

‚ÄúI know that the Department of Defence will be taking the primary lead on that, and they have stated that they are actively moving forward,‚Äù Sanders said.

However, Indian American Congressman from Silicon Valley Ro Khanna called for withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.

‚ÄúThe Democrats should be clear and bold: We are for withdrawal,‚Äù he told Vox.

‚ÄúWe should not hedge by issuing jargon-filled statements that call for additional hearings, a better strategy, or more careful review. After 16 years of that kind of muddled thinking, people expect their elected leaders to take a firm stand,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt that complicated. Either you‚Äôre for increasing troops, keeping the status quo indefinitely, or for getting out. We should be for getting out,‚Äù Khanna said.

Congressman Adam Kinzinger said the war in Afghanistan was different from the ones US has been involved in earlier as it was a ‚Äúgenerational war on terror‚Äù.

Lewis Hamilton gets back to the business of chasing Sebastian Vettel in Spa,"Although Hamilton finished in third place, it almost felt like a victory given that he started the race from the back of the grid after incurring a 15-place grid penalty. (Source: AP) Although Hamilton finished in third place, it almost felt like a victory given that he started the race from the back of the grid after incurring a 15-place grid penalty. (Source: AP)

Refreshed from Formula One‚Äôs summer vacation, Lewis Hamilton gets back to the business of trying to close the gap on championship leader Sebastian Vettel at this weekend‚Äôs Belgian GP.

Hamilton and Vettel have traded wins this season, with four victories each and one angry exchange of words in a heated moment at the Azerbaijan GP. But Vettel‚Äôs win in Hungary last month edged him 14 points clear of the British driver before the break.

It is not a significant gap, but Vettel has been keeping his Ferrari in front all season, and Hamilton needs to increase the pressure on the German driver over the remaining nine races. There is so much at stake with Hamilton aiming for a fourth world title, and Vettel aiming for a fifth. Vettel won his last title in 2013 when driving for Red Bull.

Vettel has even matched Hamilton‚Äôs Mercedes for outright pace at times, which had been considered an unrealistic prospect heading into the season. But the track at Spa _ nestled in the dense forest of Ardennes and the longest in F1 at 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) _ is more suited to Mercedes because of its fast corners and long straights.

Ferrari‚Äôs last win in Spa was Kimi Raikkonen‚Äôs back in 2009, and Mercedes has won the past two years.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre more confident coming to this race than a track like Budapest,‚Äù said Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas, who is third in the F1 title race. ‚ÄúOn the high downforce tracks Mercedes are very strong.‚Äù

Furthermore, if Hamilton needs any extra motivation for Sunday, he need only think about last year‚Äôs race.

Although Hamilton finished in third place, it almost felt like a victory given that he started the race from the back of the grid after incurring a 15-place grid penalty.

Red Bull driver Max Verstappen will also be highly motivated to do well after letting down his traveling Dutch fans by finishing a lowly 11th last year.

Some 20,000 tickets were sold to Dutch fans in 2016 _ with even more expected to be coming this time _ and he also attracts a wider interest from local fans because his mother is Belgian.

"Madhya Pradesh: Media varsity‚Äôs 50-acre campus for students, cows","The Registrar of the university Deepak Sharma The Registrar of the university Deepak Sharma

Future journalists enrolled at the Makhanlal Chaturvedi National University of Journalism and Communication near Bhopal will soon move to a new 50-acre campus, which they will share with a cowshed and its inhabitants. The new campus of the state university is in Bishankhedi, on the outskirts of Bhopal. Of the 50 acres meant for the university, 2 acres are low-lying where no construction is possible. The university administration wants to use this area for the cowshed.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the expertise to run a gaushala. Whoever runs it will decide on the number of cows and where to source them,‚Äô‚Äô vice-chancellor B K Kuthiala told The Indian Express. He said the university had no plan of running a course on cows or management of cowsheds. He pointed to the merits of having a cowshed on a university campus. ‚ÄúMilk and curd will go to students living in hostels and the staff living on the campus. Also, fuel from a biogas plant will come in handy,‚Äù the vice-chancellor said.

Kuthiala pre-empted talk of a possible RSS link. ‚ÄúI am aware that people will find an RSS connection to the proposal but that‚Äôs not true,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe suggestion came from the architect and the university cleared the proposal in 2013 itself.‚Äô‚Äô He said ancient centres of learning such as Nalanda and Takshashila were self-sufficient and had cowsheds on their campuses. He was not sure if any modern university has one, though.

He said work on the cowshed will begin only after the university shifts to the new campus, which is being developed at a cost of Rs 149 crore and will have studios for television, multi-media, animation, radio and print. There is no separate budget for a cowshed. The Makhanlal Chaturvedi National University of Journalism and Communication was set up by an Act passed in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly in 1990 and inaugurated a year later.

The university runs 21 courses in journalism, communications, management, printing, graphics and multimedia, film production and computer applications, among other subjects. The current strength of 1600-odd is likely to go up to 3,000 after operations move to the new campus from MP Nagar in Bhopal, where the smaller original campus is. In 2015, the Congress had accused the BJP government of making illegal appointments to the university, saying several people with a background in the RSS were chosen over deserving candidates who were not affiliated to any ideology.

A few years ago, the university had conducted a written examination that had questions like ‚Äúwho was the founder of the Jan Sangh‚Äù, ‚Äúwho conceptualised integral humanism‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äúwhich political leader was born on December 25‚Äù. Rival political parties accused the university of promoting RSS ideology. The secretary of the state CPI(M), Badal Saroj, accused the vice-chancellor of ingratiating himself to the powers that be. He said the move was irrational and university alumni who have made it big in the media industry and other journalists should condemn it.

Chinese Grand Prix set to extend stay,"Shanghai International Circuit held its first race in 2004. Shanghai International Circuit held its first race in 2004.

A new deal to keep the Chinese Grand Prix in the Formula One calendar has been agreed in principle and will likely be sealed within weeks, a senior F1 official said on Tuesday.

The sport, under ambitious new US-based owners, released its 2018 race schedule in June and Shanghai was only listed as provisional, along with Singapore. That prompted speculation that both races might be axed from the roster.

But Sean Bratches, F1 managing director of commercial operations, told AFP in Shanghai: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working hard with Juss Event, the promoter, and we‚Äôve got an agreement in principle. My suspicion is that it will be executed by the end of next month, fully executed.‚Äù

Bratches said that F1 chiefs released next year‚Äôs race schedule earlier than previously as part of efforts to make Formula One more fan- and sponsor-friendly.

‚ÄúNext year the schedule will be released and there will be nothing provisional about Shanghai because we will have a long-term deal,‚Äù he added, following talks in the city that pushed the agreement along.

The current deal for the Chinese Grand Prix is due to finish at the end of this year. The Shanghai International Circuit held its first race in 2004.

Australian Olympic Committee urged to modernise after bullying allegations,"John Coates will hold a news conference later on Thursday at which he will announce the Chef de Mission for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. (Source: Reuters) John Coates will hold a news conference later on Thursday at which he will announce the Chef de Mission for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. (Source: Reuters)

The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) has been urged to modernise in a report into its workplace culture that was commissioned after allegations of bullying earlier this year.

Media director Mike Tancred, a fiercely loyal ally of long-serving AOC President John Coates, was ‚Äúseverely reprimanded‚Äù in June after being found guilty of ‚Äúdisreputable conduct‚Äù towards former chief executive Fiona de Jong.

The case triggered a series of accusations of bullying at the organisation and the report released on Thursday said staff spoke of witnessing ‚Äú‚Äòdeceitful‚Äô, ‚Äòtwo-faced‚Äô, ‚Äòegotistic‚Äô and/or ‚Äòbelligerent'‚Äù behaviour from senior figures.

Stakeholders also perceived that Coates, who comfortably survived a challenge to his 27-year leadership of the body in May, exercised ‚Äúoverriding influence or control over the AOC‚Äù.

New chief executive Matt Carroll said the AOC would implement all 17 recommendations of the review, which presented the body with a ‚Äúplatform to reset the organisation‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe AOC‚Äôs modes of operation that may at one time have served us well are being questioned and our organisational culture has come under scrutiny,‚Äù he said in a statement.

‚ÄúThe AOC executive acknowledges the reality of the challenge we face in this area and we are committed to build a culture that is fit for purpose and aligned to our exposed values and principles.‚Äù

Coates will hold a news conference later on Thursday at which he will announce the Chef de Mission for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, with Kitty Chiller expected to retain the role despite a tricky debut in Rio.

US President Donald Trump hinted on Tuesday that he would issue a pardon for Joe Arpaio, a controversial former sheriff convicted last month of criminal contempt in a racial profiling case. Trump, who had already held out the possibility of a pardon for Arpaio, decided against announcing it at a major rally in Arizona on Tuesday night but hinted he would step in at some point.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll make a prediction. I think he‚Äôs going to be just fine, okay? But I won‚Äôt do it tonight because I don‚Äôt want to cause any controversy. But Sheriff Joe can feel good.‚Äù Arpaio, an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, was the sheriff of Maricopa County in Phoenix before he lost a re-election bid last year.

"Stabbed with two knives: As he bled to death, man begged for water, people recorded him instead","A grab from the video A grab from the video

After being stabbed multiple times, allegedly by four people on Tuesday, a 25-year-old welder begged passersby in the crowded lanes of Vishnu Garden for water. Instead of helping him, the crowd that had gathered recorded videos of him on their mobile phones, his brother alleged.

The victim, identified as Akbar Ali, had two knives lodged inside his ribs. Even though he managed to remove one, he was unable to get the second one out. While Ali succumbed to his injuries at the hospital on Wednesday, two people have been arrested in connection with the incident.

In two short videos purportedly shot by people at the spot, passersby can be heard asking for his address. He is heard replying that he belongs to B block, following which he makes desperate gestures for water.

However, the crowd continued making videos of the man, even as he bleeds profusely. DCP (West), Vijay Kumar, said that by the time police received a PCR call about the incident, the victim had been admitted to DDU Hospital. Speaking to The Indian Express, Najare Imam, the victim‚Äôs brother, said, ‚ÄúHe kept fighting till his last breath. He pulled out one knife from his rib, but could not take the other one out. He begged for help and they (the crowd) chose to make videos of my brother.‚Äù

According to police, the accused claimed that Ali was was a local criminal, and that the murder weapons belonged to him. A police officer privy to the details of the case said, ‚ÄúMohd Shubhan, a welder, and Mohd Afzal, a painter, were arrested from the neighbourhood after the murder. They have claimed that Ali was trying to extort them. When a scuffle broke out between them, after they refused to pay him, the two accused stabbed him with his own knives in a bid to fight back, they claimed.‚Äù

However, police are yet to find any police record against Ali or the two people who have been arrested. Imam, on the other hand, alleged that Ali was attacked by the four men who first threw chilli powder at him and later stabbed him to death.

‚ÄúI was running an errand when I got to know about the stabbing. He was stabbed in full public view and was saved by a woman who was taking her child to school. She was also attacked with knives. Police are saying that he was a criminal, but that is not true. There is no criminal case against him and he was attacked for having an affair with the wife of one of the accused a few years ago. They kept pestering him for that,‚Äù he claimed.

"Kerala HC upholds CM Pinarayi Vijayan‚Äôs discharge, says CBI ‚Äòwrongly picked‚Äô him","Chief Minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan (File) Chief Minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan (File)

THE KERALA High Court on Wednesday upheld the verdict of the CBI court, which had allowed Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan‚Äôs discharge in the SNC Lavalin corruption case. The court observed that the investigating agency had ‚Äúwrongly picked‚Äù Vijayan ‚Äúwithout the support of any material (evidence)‚Äù. Vijayan was listed as the seventh accused in the case, which dates back to the mid-1990s, when he was the electricity minister in the CPI(M)-led LDF government in the state.

Justice P Ubaid of the High Court also upheld discharge of the first and eighth accused by the lower court in the Rs 374.5-crore graft case. The judge held, ‚ÄúThe prosecution does not have sufficient and satisfactory material to work out a prima facie case against accused (numbers) one, seven (Vijayan) and the eighth. To frame a charge, there must be something before the court‚Ä¶to form a judicious opinion that they might have committed the alleged offence.‚Äô‚Äô

About Vijayan, Justice Ubaid said, ‚ÄúI find that despite material showing failure and inaction on part of many ministers who succeeded him, the CBI wrongly picked and chose the seventh accused for prosecution on an allegation of conspiracy without the support of any material.‚Äô‚Äô The court observed that the project was approved by the state Cabinet, and ‚Äúit would be unjust and illegal to pick and choose‚Äù Vijayan, the then electricity minister, and ‚Äúprosecute him for the wrong or illegality committed by the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB)‚Äù.

The case is about an agreement between KSEB and Canadian firm SNC Lavalin for renovation of three hydel power projects in Kerala. The CAG had found that the deal had caused a loss of Rs 374.5 crore to the exchequer, which led to the case.

In 2013, the CBI trial court in Thiruvananthapuram had allowed the discharge petitions of Vijayan and other accused in the case. The CBI had challenged the decision in High Court. The High Court partially allowed the agency‚Äôs revision petition, as Justice Ubaid set aside the discharge of three others accused in the case.

Except Vijayan and a representative of Lavalin, all the other accused were bureaucrats then associated with KSEB and the power department. The court said, ‚ÄúEven if allegations against these three accused are accepted, such acts will not by itself amount to an act of misconduct punishable under Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. In the absence of any material or circumstances to show that these three persons had any sort of involvement‚Ä¶ they cannot be roped in under Section 120(B) of IPC.‚Äù Stating that the verdict gives him ‚Äúmore energy‚Äù, Vijayan said, ‚ÄúThe CPI(M) had stated that the case was politically motivated. That stand has been substantiated. Certain forces wanted to hurt the party through this case. They used CBI as a tool to target the party.‚Äù

In a statement, the CPI(M) Politburo said, ‚ÄúThe High Court has stated that Pinarayi Vijayan was deliberately targeted by CBI. The court has comprehensively debunked all allegations levelled against him. The Lavalin case was sought to be used to besmirch the image of a leader of CPI(M) and the party. The verdict has effectively exposed these efforts.‚Äù

"Yemen officials: Saudi-led coalition strikes hotel, several dead","A victim is carried from the site of an airstrike on a hotel in Arhab, Yemen Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2017. (Al-Masira TV via AP) A victim is carried from the site of an airstrike on a hotel in Arhab, Yemen Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2017. (Al-Masira TV via AP)

The Saudi-led coalition carried out several airstrikes in Yemen early on Wednesday, hitting a small hotel near the capital of Sanaa and killing dozens of people, Yemeni officials and witnesses said. There were conflicting reports on the victims, with doctors saying they were farmers and officials and witnesses saying they included Houthi rebels.

The fighter jets targeted a two-story hotel in Qaa al-Qaidhi district, located in the town of Arhab, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) north of Sanaa, officials said.

The building sustained extensive damage and bodies were still being retrieved from under the rubble, witnesses said later on Wednesday. Another airstrike hit a checkpoint manned by the Houthis, a few kilometers (miles) from the hotel, they added. The officials and the witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.

Footage of the area aired on al-Masirah TV, a Houthi-run satellite news network, showed bodies hanging out of a simple cinderblock building. Bystanders wrapped mangled corpses into blankets to try to carry them away.

The TV network said 41 civilians were killed and that the death toll was expected to rise further. Officials and witnesses told The Associated Press that the death toll had reached 60 and that the majority of those killed were Houthis rebels.

Physician Ali al-Rakmi who was helping at the site of the hotel strike, said there were more than 100 people inside at the time of the attack, all farmers who work in growing qat. The plant‚Äôs leaves are chewed for a stimulant effect, a widespread tradition among Yemeni men.

Al-Rakmi said they had retrieved 35 bodies so far, with many only as pieces of bodies.

Fahd Marhab, head of the Umrah hospital about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the site of the airstrike, said there were no wounded and that all the people in the hotel were killed in the 3 a.m. airstrike. He also said that they were mostly farmers. It was not possible to reconcile the discrepancies in the accounts and the different number of fatalities reported by the officials and the TV.

There was no immediate comment from the coalition.

The Saudi-led coalition has been waging an extensive air campaign against the Houthis and forces loyal to ousted Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh since March 2015, seeking to push the rebels from lands they captured, including Sanaa, and restore the internationally recognized government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to power.

But the airstrikes have also hit civilian targets, such as schools, hospitals, and markets, killing thousands and prompting rights groups to accuse the Saudi-led coalition of committing war crimes. Activists have also called upon Western countries, including the United States and Britain, to cease military support for the coalition.

Yemen‚Äôs conflict began after the Houthis swept into Sanaa in 2014 and overthrew Hadi‚Äôs government, forcing it to relocate to the southern port city of Aden and prompting Hadi to seek military support from Arab Gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia.

The conflict has so far killed over 10,000 civilians, displaced 3 million people and pushed the impoverished nation to the brink of famine.

Wednesday‚Äôs hotel bombing comes amid stepped-up airstrikes in and around Sanaa, with army compounds and other Houthi locations targeted. Also hit was the Rimah Hamid military camp south of Sanaa, where officers are loyal to Saleh‚Äôs forces.

The Houthi-Saleh alliance, meanwhile, has seen a long-simmering power struggle burst into the open. Over the past days, the two sides have exchanged accusations and threats ahead of a rally on Thursday to mark the 35th anniversary of the founding of Saleh‚Äôs party, the General People‚Äôs Congress.

Saleh and the Houthis were always unlikely allies. As president, Saleh fought the Houthis from 2004 till 2009 in their northern heartland of Saada. After his overthrow in the 2011 uprising under a deal that gave him immunity from prosecution in return for giving up power, Saleh and the Houthis struck an alliance of convenience with a common enemy ‚Äî Hadi‚Äôs government and his Islamist Islah party allies.

Sanaa is packed with armed men and armored vehicles, fueling fears of open clashes between Saleh‚Äôs forces and the Houthis. Saleh has complained that the rebels have sidelined him and his loyalists, leaving them out of military and political decisions, as well as U.N.-sponsored negotiations to end Yemen‚Äôs civil war.

England eyes Champions League revival with five in group draw,"The group stage kicks off on September 13, and the final is played on May 26 in Kiev, at the Olympic Stadium. (Source: Reuters) The group stage kicks off on September 13, and the final is played on May 26 in Kiev, at the Olympic Stadium. (Source: Reuters)

England aims to revive a fading record in the Champions League with five teams in the group-stage draw for the first time on Thursday.

Liverpool‚Äôs advance through the playoffs Wednesday means it joins top-seeded Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United, plus Tottenham in the 32-team draw in Monaco. Man United enters as Europa League winner after placing only sixth in the Premier League.

Chelsea‚Äôs 2012 Champions League title is the only English win in nine seasons and an era of all-Premier League semifinals has passed.

Now, Liverpool and Tottenham risk landing in a blockbuster four-team group as both will be drawn from the pot of third-seeded teams.

A powerful pot of second-seeded teams who did not win their national league features five of the eight teams highest-ranked by UEFA. They include Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain.

Real Madrid heads top-seeded clubs as the two-time defending champion, and fourth straight Champions League winner from Spain. Madrid is joined by Juventus, Bayern Munich and other winners of Europe‚Äôs eight highest-ranked national leagues.

That top pot also includes Spartak Moscow, ranked No. 104 by UEFA, No. 18 Shakhtar Donetsk, and Monaco, which sold several stars after reaching the semifinals last season.

One year ago, Monaco was a dangerous outlier in Pot 4 because it had few UEFA ranking points from the five previous seasons in the Champions League and Europa League.

Leipzig could now fill that role in its European debut after being the surprise Bundesliga runner-up. Created in 2009, Leipzig did not exist when Feyenoord, the 1970 European Cup winner, last played in the group stage 15 years ago.

Leipzig and Qarabag, the 106th-ranked champion of Azerbaijan, are the only group-stage newcomers. Germany has just three teams in Thursday‚Äôs draw after Hoffenheim was eliminated by Liverpool. That won‚Äôt happen again after new rules come into force.

From next season, the big four leagues currently Spain, Germany, England and Italy each get four direct entries to the groups and skip the playoffs. No two teams from the same country can be drawn in the same group.

Prize money is also set to rise in 2018 when more valuable renewals of three-year broadcasting deals kick in. For now, each team in Thursday‚Äôs draw will again get just a basic fee of 12.7 million euros ($14.95 million) from UEFA. More is earned from results bonuses and advancing through knockout rounds. The 32 teams share a total prize fund of more than 1.3 billion euros ($1.53 billion).

The group stage kicks off on Sept. 13, and the final is played on May 26 in Kiev, at the Olympic Stadium which hosted the 2012 European Championship final. It will be problematic for UEFA if either Moscow club goes all the way to the final in Ukraine‚Äôs capital city.

Since 2014, UEFA has separated Russian and Ukrainian national and club teams in competition draws during an ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian separatists.

CSKA Moscow in the fourth-seeded pot must be kept apart from top-seeded Shakhtar‚Äôs group when retired greats Francesco Totti and Andriy Shevchenko assist in the draw ceremony.

Seedings:-

Pot 1: Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Juventus, Benfica, Monaco, Spartak Moscow, Shakhtar Donetsk.

Pot 2: Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Borussia Dortmund, Manchester City, Sevilla, Porto, Manchester United.

Pot 3: Napoli, Tottenham, Basel, Olympiakos, Anderlecht, Liverpool, Roma, Besiktas.

Pot 4: Celtic, CSKA Moscow, Sporting Lisbon, APOEL, Feyenoord, Maribor, Qarabag, Leipzig.

A Mumbai man was seen in possession of the new Rs 50 bank note on Thursday. An exclusive picture of the man with the new note has been accessed by The Indian Express.

The new denomination Rs 50 banknote in the Mahatma Gandhi (new) series bears the signature of central bank governor Urjit Patel. It has motif of Hampi with Chariot on the reverse, depicting the country‚Äôs cultural heritage. The base colour of the note is Fluorescent Blue.

MMA-UFC confirm positive test for light-heavyweight champ Jon Jones,"Daniel Cormier (below) and Jon Jones are two fierce rivals. (Source: AP File) Daniel Cormier (below) and Jon Jones are two fierce rivals. (Source: AP File)

UFC light-heavyweight champion Jon Jones, who beat Daniel Cormier to reclaim the title on July 29, could be stripped of his crown once more after the organisation announced that the American had failed a drugs test for a second time.

Originally stripped of the title in 2015 following a hit-and-run incident, the 30-year-old was due to fight Cormier for the belt in July 2016 but was banned for a year after testing positive for two banned substances in the run-up to that bout.

Last month‚Äôs UFC 214 title fight against Cormier, which he won via a third-round TKO, was his first since the ban ended.

‚ÄúThe UFC organisation was notified today that the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) has informed Jon Jones of a potential Anti-Doping Policy violation stemming from an in-competition sample collected following his weigh-in on July 28, 2017,‚Äù the UFC said on its website.

‚ÄúJon, his trainers, his nutritionists and his entire camp have worked tirelessly and meticulously the past 12 months to avoid this exact situation,‚Äù the fighter‚Äôs manager Malki Kawa said in a statement.

‚ÄúWe are having the samples tested again to determine the validity or source of contamination.‚Äù Cormier also expressed disappointment upon hearing the news of Jones‚Äô positive test.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to find words to describe how I‚Äôm feeling right now,‚Äù Cormier told MMAFighting.com. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed to hear the news. It‚Äôs very emotional.

We will see what happens next.‚Äù Jones is considered by many to be one of the best mixed martial artists of all time, winning 23 of his 24 contests with his only loss coming via a disqualification in 2009.

Pakistan could lose ‚Äòmajor non-NATO ally status‚Äô: Rex Tillerson,"Tillerson‚Äôs comments came after Trump announced his Afghan policy and the path forward to the US engagement in South Asia, India and Pakistan in particular. (File) Tillerson‚Äôs comments came after Trump announced his Afghan policy and the path forward to the US engagement in South Asia, India and Pakistan in particular. (File)

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson tuesday warned that the US could consider punishing Pakistan by cutting off its status as a major non-NATO ally if it does not crack down on militants. Tillerson echoed President Donald Trump‚Äôs tough rhetoric on Pakistan in his address laying out a new strategy for the war Afghanistan.

‚ÄúWe stand ready to help Pakistan address terrorist organisations inside of their country, but they must adopt a different approach themselves,‚Äù Tillerson told reporters at a news conference here. His comments came after Trump announced his Afghan policy and the path forward to the US engagement in South Asia, India and Pakistan in particular.

‚ÄúPakistan and the US historically had very good relationships. But over the last few years, there‚Äôs been a real erosion in the confidence between our two governments. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been an erosion in trust because we have witnessed terrorist organisations being given safe haven inside of Pakistan to plan and carry out attacks against US servicemen, US officials, disrupting peace efforts inside of Afghanistan,‚Äù Tillerson said.

Noting that the new Afghan policy is a regional approach, the Secretary of State said it also included a fairly comprehensive review of the US‚Äô ties with Pakistan and India. ‚ÄúWe see this approach as requiring an integration of all three of those strategies and use Pakistan and India to also bring pressure to bear on the situation in Afghanistan,‚Äù he said.

Tillerson said that the Trump Administration is adopting conditions-based diplomacy. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to condition our efforts along with the progress we see being made by the Afghan government who must continue the reform efforts that we‚Äôve been working on for some time, and in particular, much more rigorous efforts around anti-corruption,‚Äù he said.

Trump, he said, in his speech was clear that this entire effort is intended to put pressure on the Taliban to have the Taliban understand they will not win a battlefield victory. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to attack terrorists wherever the live and we have put people on notice that if you‚Äôre harbouring and providing safe haven to terrorists, be warned, be forewarned that we‚Äôre going to engage with those who are providing safe haven and ask them to change what they‚Äôre doing and help us help them,‚Äù Tillerson said.

Tillerson also acknowledged that Pakistan‚Äôs status as a non-NATO ally is now in question. ‚ÄúWe have some leverage that‚Äôs been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them; their status as a non-NATO alliance partner. All of that can be put on the table. But at the end of the day, Pakistan has to decide what is in Pakistan‚Äôs best long-term interest from a security standpoint for themselves and for their people,‚Äù he said.

He said the Taliban and other organisations inside of Pakistan seem to be growing their numbers and their presence to the point that at some point they would become a real threat to the stability of the Pakistani government itself. ‚ÄúI think they need to be thinking about what is in their best long-term interest and how can we work with them to achieve a safer, more stable Pakistan in the next decades to come as well. I think it really is up to them. They‚Äôve got to ask themselves that question,‚Äù Tillerson said.

Taliban reacts to Donald Trump‚Äôs Afghan policy: Trump‚Äôs Afghan strategy is ‚Äònothing new‚Äô,"‚ÄúFor generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are fresh and we will continue this war until our last breath,‚Äù Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location. (Photo: AP ‚ÄúFor generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are fresh and we will continue this war until our last breath,‚Äù Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location. (Photo: AP

The Taliban dismissed Donald Trump‚Äôs strategy for Afghanistan as vague and ‚Äúnothing new‚Äù today after the US president cleared the way for thousands more American troops to be sent to the war-torn country. ‚ÄúFor now I can tell you there was nothing new in his speech and it was very unclear,‚Äù in Afghanistan, told AFP.

He added that the militants were preparing a formal statement which would be released later. Trump backtracked from his promise to rapidly end America‚Äôs longest war in his first formal address to the nation as commander-in-chief late Monday, though he did not offer specifics.

He said he had concluded ‚Äúthe consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable‚Äù, leaving a vacuum that terrorists ‚Äúwould instantly fill.‚Äù A senior Taliban commander told AFP that Trump was just perpetuating the ‚Äúarrogant behaviour‚Äù of previous presidents such as George Bush.

‚ÄúHe is just wasting American soldiers. We know how to defend our country. It will not change anything. ‚ÄúFor generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are resh and we will continue this war until our last breath,‚Äù he told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location.

He added that the statement proved the current Afghan government ‚Äúis a US puppet‚Äù. The insurgents also signalled their intentions minutes after Trump spoke by claiming the US embassy in Kabul had been the target of a rocket attack late Monday.

The rocket landed in a field in the city‚Äôs diplomatic quarter, with no casualties reported. While Trump refused to offer detailed troop numbers, senior White House officials said he had already authorised his defence secretary to deploy up to 3,900 more troops to Afghanistan.

He also lambasted ally Pakistan for offering safe haven to ‚Äúagents of chaos.‚Äù A commander from the Taliban-allied Haqqani network, long believed to have links to Pakistan‚Äôs shadowy military establishment, told AFP that Trump ‚Äúhas proved it‚Äôs a Crusade‚Äù.

‚ÄúHis statement has proved that he wants to eliminate the entire Muslim umma (community),‚Äù he said. Prior to Trump‚Äôs announcement the Taliban had written an open letter warning him not to send more troops and calling for the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.

Tri-Nation series: India win tournament despite draw against St Kitts and Nevis,"India vs St Kitts and Nevis ends in a draw. (Source: PTI) India vs St Kitts and Nevis ends in a draw. (Source: PTI)

In a heartbreak for India, the Blue Tiger‚Äôs nine-match winning streak came to an end after a difficult yet thrilling match against lower placed St Kitts and Nevis on Thursday which ended in a draw. India, however, won the tournament with four points, having defeated Mauritius 2-1 in their previous encounter.

St. Kitts and Nevis took advantage of India missing a number of chances as they equalised with a goal in the second half by a shot from Gvaune Amory, which Subrata Paul failed to save. However, the keeper needs to be credited for an amazing display, having saved a number of goals to help India avoid defeat.

The visitors had to wait for 33 minutes for the equaliser. Gvaune netted the ball after being assisted by Tiano Hanley, who headed the ball to the goal-scorer after a corner. Jackichand Singh scored the opening goal in the 38th minute of the match but the men in blue have a lot to work on ahead of the AFC Asia Cup.

After Robin Singh came in the second half to replace Balwant, he failed to convert many chances to double India‚Äôs lead before the visitors equalised. India are placed at 97, according to the latest FIFA ranking.

Indian-origin Malaysian man jailed for life in Singapore,"When Saravanan returned to Johor on November 5, 2014, he was asked by Aya to repay the money, but he could not do so immediately, the Strait Times report said. When Saravanan returned to Johor on November 5, 2014, he was asked by Aya to repay the money, but he could not do so immediately, the Strait Times report said.

A 30-year-old Indian-origin Malaysian man has been jailed for life in Singapore along with 24 strokes of cane-lashing for smuggling drugs.

Saravanan Chandaram, 30, who pleaded guilty to two charges of importing the controlled drugs, also received the maximum 24 strokes of the cane, the Straits Times reported.

The prosecution submitted a certificate to the court stating that Saravanan was only a drug courier and had substantively helped the authorities to disrupt drug trafficking.

This gave the judge the discretion to impose a life sentence instead of the mandatory death penalty.

Saravanan was found with 10 bundles containing at least 1.38 kilogrammes of cannabis, and at least 3.29 kilogrammes of cannabinol and cannabinol derivative.

On November 5, 2014, he rented a car and met a drug syndicate leader, known only as Aya, in Skudai in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, where he collected the 10 bundles of drugs.

Saravanan, who worked for Aya as his bodyguard and personal driver, hid the bundles under the armrest of the rear passenger seat.

Defence lawyer Singa Retnam, in his closing submissions to the court last month, said that Saravanan had borrowed Malaysian Ringgit 4,000 (Singapore dollars 1,270) from Aya as he did not have enough savings for his son‚Äôs operation.

When Saravanan returned to Johor on November 5, 2014, he was asked by Aya to repay the money, but he could not do so immediately, the Strait Times report said.

He had no choice but to adhere to his boss‚Äôs demands and agreed to deliver 10 packets of tobacco, for Malaysian Ringgit 2,000, according to the defence‚Äôs submissions.

The defence said that Saravanan believed he was delivering 10 packets of tobacco, instead of cannabis.

However, the prosecution said that Saravanan‚Äôs belief was unfounded when there were clearly suspicious circumstances surrounding the delivery of the drugs.

There were also inconsistencies in his account as he had initially said he was promised Singapore dollars 5,000 for the delivery, but later claimed he was promised Malaysian Ringgit 2,000.

The prosecution noted that Saravanan was being paid a disproportionately high amount of Singapore dollars 5,000 for a relatively simple task of delivery.

‚ÄòDelhi is no longer about any one kind of food‚Äô: Sadia Dehlvi,"‚ÄúMy earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta,‚Äù Sadia Dehlvi says. ‚ÄúMy earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta,‚Äù Sadia Dehlvi says.

Through the streets of Shahajahanabad, into the kitchen of some of the oldest families of Delhi, Sadia Dehlvi looks at the shape-shifter of a city that Delhi has come to be in her recent book Jasmine and Jinns. She talks of growing up in an extended Dilli family that lived in Shama Kothi on Sardar Patel Marg, the changes in the city‚Äôs palate over the years and giving Delhi one of its culinary stars ‚Äì Al Kauser. Excerpts:

In the book, you trace your childhood through seasons and recipes telling us about a Delhi that once was. How did you narrow down on the idea?

Delhi has distinct seasons, and once upon a time lifestyles revolved around the weather. I would hear stories of how shopkeepers pulled down their shutters when the first rains arrived and went to Mehrauli for picnics with their families. Special dishes were made in the monsoon like Harimirch Qeema, Besani Roti and fresh Mango Chutney. Nihari was always associated with winter, and was eaten nihar muh, that is on an empty stomach. In winters, at home, every Sunday was ‚Äònihari day.‚Äô We had it as early breakfast. Now people eat nihari all through the year and usually for lunch or dinner. It was traditionally referred to as gharib aadmi ka khana, and never served at weddings. Now nihari is a part of festive cuisine, even for us Dilliwalas.

In the summer, very little spice was used and I remember a variety of sherbets being made at home. These were mixed with barley water to keep us hydrated. Special chutneys were made with raw mango to save us from the severe heat. People in Delhi are exceedingly particular about taseer ‚Äî inherent food properties and their effects on the body. I grew up relating to food in terms of halka (light), bhaari (heavy), garam (warm), or thanda (cold). Spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and peppercorns are believed to have garam taseer, and dishes which have these as ingredients are cooked mostly in winter. There is a hidden wisdom in such beliefs.

What are your first and most enduring memories of food?

My earliest memories are of spices being dried in the lawn and then ground in an imamdasta. In those days, ready to use spices were not used in most homes. When large parties were held at home, I recall professional cooks coming to the house, cooking in deghs with the meat and spices provided to them. Tandoors were dug in the house for fresh rotis. There was a separate area in the house of kuchi mitti for this kind of cooking. My grandfather was a gracious host, and Shama Kothi acquired the reputation of serving the city‚Äôs finest cuisine.

How did you choose the recipes for the book?

Most of these dishes are cooked in my home and in the kitchens of most Dilliwalas. Except for recipes of a few specialties cooked on festivals and weddings, the rest of the dishes are really a part of our day to day cooking. One does not require some exotic spices to make them. And since our food is dominated by seasons, that‚Äôs how I have divided the food sections. We usually cook almost all seasonal vegetables with meat. It‚Äôs not just a good way to balance the intake of meat and vegetables, but also to create a variety of wonderful dishes.

Shami Kebabs Shami Kebabs

You mention how Delhi‚Äôs palate changed with the arrival of the Mughals and then with the British. What are the changes you notice in Delhi‚Äôs food culture today?

The Mughal cuisine, that is Indo Persian, is probably the cuisine that best defines Delhi‚Äôs traditional non-vegetarian cuisine. Chillies were added to Delhi food in the 18th century on the advise of the city‚Äôs hakims after the water in the canal that ran through Chandni Chowk got polluted. It was a way to purge toxins from the body. This is what led to the creation of Delhi‚Äôs popular chaat. Delhi‚Äôs cuisine once comprised Jain, Bania and Muslim food. Then the British influenced the eating habits of the elite. More changes came after Partition, with the arrival of the Punjabis. Tandoori chicken, butter chicken, choley bhaturey and dal makhani, came to typify Delhi food. But even that has changed, Delhi is no longer about any one kind of food. People from all over the country have made Delhi their home. So it‚Äôs now as much about dosa, momos, noodles as it is about biryani and qorma.

In the book, you mention how your mother wasn‚Äôt interested in kitchen chores. How do you think women‚Äôs relationship with food has changed?

My mother resented kitchen chores, because in those days women‚Äôs lives seemed to revolve around cooking. She rebelled against that idea and, luckily, she never really had to cook. She did other things and didn‚Äôt encourage me to cook either. Even now, she can‚Äôt understand my obsession with cooking. She tells me not to waste too much time in the kitchen. With so many women working, I think now cooking is not really looked at in a regressive way. Young working couples seem to order in or eat out so often. More and more young people are into health, and one has to cook right to eat right. With the internet, world cuisine has opened up and I meet so many young women who are experimenting with cooking various types of food. If you don‚Äôt look at cooking as a boring chore, it can be so much fun.

Family recipes were not shared earlier. But you believe in sharing them.

In older days, women or professional cooks never shared recipes. If they did, they would leave out a main ingredient so one could never get it right. I share family recipes because it gladdens my heart that they‚Äôll bring cheer to people‚Äôs tables. Many of these have never travelled out of traditional Dilli homes. When friends come home for meals, they are surprised at the unusual combinations such as karela qeema, gajar salan, chuqandar gosht, bhindi salan that are regular fare for us.

How did Al Kauser come about?

I began Al Kauser with my mother in 1979. It was a small kiosk just opposite our house. After having lived a year in New York, I was very taken with the idea of street food. In those days, Delhi just had five star hotels and a few good restaurants, mostly in Connaught Place. Other than these, one had to go to old Delhi to eat kebabs. Al Kauser was the first road side kebab shop in New Delhi. It became quite a rage in the ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s. The kitchen was in our house. Entertaining in those years became so easy, as I could literally order a plate of kebab from my room. Now, street food is so much a part of Delhi culture.

Tell us the story behind the book‚Äôs title and the cover design.

Jasmine is the fragrance from my childhood. It was my grandmother‚Äôs favourite flower. We had jasmine shrubs in our gardens and I would help amma pluck them. In the summer, when we slept on the terrace, these were put on the charpais of the elders. The girls of the house were not allowed to wear jasmine flowers because amma said that jinns were attracted to young girls who wore jasmine. I also believe we had jinns that lived with us. In the evening, just before sunset, we had to stop playing in the gardens as amma said it was the time jinns ventured out. Throughout the 50 years we lived at Shama Kothi, we heard strange noises every night. So I guess my childhood was about Jasmine and Jinns. The cover idea by Shaaz Ahmed is old style story telling, with various elements from my childhood.

"80-year-old branded witch in Bhilwara, Rajasthan, confined in room for 18 days in","Ramkanya Devi in hospital Ramkanya Devi in hospital

An 80-year-old woman, labelled a witch by a Jat family and locked up in her own home for 18 days, was rescued by a district administration team on Tuesday and admitted to a government hospital in Bhilwara district. When Ramkanya Devi, mother of four, spoke to The Indian Express she was lying in the ICU of the Mahatma Gandhi Government Hospital. She kept covering her face with an odhni, as if to block out daylight. She kept clutching her sister Sugna‚Äôs hand.

When asked why she was called a witch and locked up in a 10ftx10ft windowless room, where she cowered, hardly ate and relieved herself, Ramkanya seemed reluctant to speak much. ‚ÄúI am not a witch. But let it go,‚Äù she said, then broke into sobs. Ramkanya‚Äôs family is the only Nai (barber) household in Bholi village that has 60 Jat families, a higher and more influential caste. The woman‚Äôs fault: she lived across the street from a school, where Pooja, a girl from a Jat home, went to study. When Pooja fell ill, her family consulted a quack, who said she was being consumed by a daakan (a witch). The Mangrop police station, has filed an FIR against Shivraj and Sunil Jat ‚Äî Pooja‚Äôs relatives ‚Äîunder the Rajasthan Prevention of Witch Hunting Act, 2015. ‚ÄúWe have registered an FIR under relevant sections of the Act. Both accused are untraceable,‚Äù station house officer of Mangrop said.

Sugna said her sister used to be the village midwife and everyone was fond of her. ‚ÄúThey would call her amma. But then she injured her head 8-10 years ago. Since then, she has been a little slow. And now look what she has become,‚Äù she said. The Jat family‚Äôs search for a witch ended at the quiet, socially awkward Ramkanya. ‚ÄúTwo days before they attacked us, the Jats visited us and told us our mother is a witch. She is making their daughter ill and asked us to either lock her up or leave the village. They said they would burn our house,‚Äù Mahaveer, Ramkanya‚Äôs youngest son, said. On August 4, Shivraj and Sunil Jat came to Ramkanya‚Äôs residence.

‚ÄúThey started thrashing my father and almost broke his jaw. My mother ran inside. The men then told us to lock her up. They said my mother was consuming their daughter,‚Äù said Jagdish, another son. ‚ÄúWe fell at their feet and apologised and said we would lock her up,‚Äù he said. Ramkanya was rescued Tuesday by a district team. The doctors at the hospital, where she was taken after being rescued, said the woman came back from the brink of death.

Initial momentum crucial during home stretch: U Mumba coach E Bhaskaran,"U Mumba will take on Jaipur Pink Panthers in their first home game at the NSCI in suburban Worli on August 25. (Source: AP) U Mumba will take on Jaipur Pink Panthers in their first home game at the NSCI in suburban Worli on August 25. (Source: AP)

U Mumba coach E Bhaskaran on Wednesday said the initial momentum during their home stretch of the season five of the Pro Kabaddi League is crucial for the team.

U Mumba have so far played six matches, with equal number of wins and losses, and have grabbed 16 points. ‚ÄúPlaying six matches at a go is not a pressure situation for us.

It is all about the first game, if we perform and do well, we will all gain confidence to move ahead. The initial momentum is very crucial during the home stretch,‚Äù Bhaskaran was quoted as saying in a media release issued in Mumbai.

Team skipper Anup Kumar also echoed similar feelings saying it is all about getting the first match right.

‚ÄúIt is all about getting that first match right. If you see Gujarat, their home stretch has been very good in terms of performance. This is largely because they started on the right note. Our first match is against Jaipur and if we do well there, I know that the team will capitalise on that first win and use that as a motivation for the rest,‚Äù Kumar said in the release.

U Mumba will take on Jaipur Pink Panthers in their first home game at the NSCI in suburban Worli on August 25.

"I can‚Äôt commit for World XI until security details are clarified, says Paul Collingwood","Paul Collingwood is reportedly mulling the prospect of playing of playing for Andy flower‚Äôs World XI. (Source: Reuters) Paul Collingwood is reportedly mulling the prospect of playing of playing for Andy flower‚Äôs World XI. (Source: Reuters)

Former England captain Paul Collingwood is reportedly mulling the prospect of playing of playing for Andy flower‚Äôs World XI in Pakistan next month. As per earlier reports, Collingwood has been approached and will reportedly earn around 75,000 pounds if he decided to play.

Commenting on the issue, Collingwood said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of speculation on social media, probably because I‚Äôve got a week off with Durham [in the Specsavers Championship] so it fits well with the dates, but I can‚Äôt give you too much. I‚Äôve been asked if I would be willing but, until details about security [are clarified], then you don‚Äôt know, you can‚Äôt commit‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a starting point (Flower‚Äôs approach), more than anything else,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Andy‚Äôs probably asked 50 cricketers from around the world, maybe even more, just to see if they‚Äôd entertain the idea,‚Äù he added.

Speaking on the aspect of security, the former England skipper said, ‚ÄúIf you are going to be involved in something like this, you want to ask as many different people as you can. The security firms that people employ are very important ‚Äì Reg Dickason with England, I‚Äôve had a lot of trust in him ‚Äì so it‚Äôll be exactly the same as when you play for England. You ask a lot of questions and until you know the details, it‚Äôs silly to say you would be willing to do anything. But that‚Äôs the next step and we‚Äôll go from there‚Äù.

However, Collingwood di go on to say that at the age of 41 years playing a t20 for a world XI side will be exciting. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not one main reason why you‚Äôd get involved but certainly, as a 41-year-old, if I could play a T20 international in front of a big crowd, that would float anybody‚Äôs boat. Of course the money would be a good thing, of course helping Pakistan would be a good thing. There‚Äôs all sorts of reasons, but the tag of a World XI for a 41-year-old, I‚Äôm quite proud of that if I was to get in that team.‚Äù

Injury concerns might rule out Sam Whiteman for 2017/18 season,"Sam Whiteman is in doubt for the entire Australian summer. (Source: AP) Sam Whiteman is in doubt for the entire Australian summer. (Source: AP)

25-year old Australian wicketkeeper, Sam Whiteman is in doubt for the entire Australian summer due to complications that have arisen from a serious finger injury. It may be recalled here that Whiteman fractured his right index finger during Perth Scorchers‚Äô Big Bash League final.

In a statement released the WA Cricket Association(WACA) said, ‚ÄúSam Whiteman is continuing to experience ongoing pain and swelling in his left index finger related to the complex intra-articular fracture he sustained in the BBL|06 final. To date, surgical intervention and targeted rehabilitation has been unable to reduce the pain he is experiencing to a satisfactory level for state level wicketkeeping‚Äù.

‚ÄúWACA Sports Medicine Staff and Sam are consulting further with hand specialists in the coming week and will soon be in a position to make a decision on the future direction of Sam‚Äôs management. At this stage a timeframe for his return to play is unknown although further surgical intervention is being considered.‚Äù

Meanwhile, former Australian batsman, Justin Langer rued the setback and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really unfortunate, he‚Äôs had two surgeries now on his finger. He‚Äôs seeing another surgeon in a week‚Äôs time to maybe have a look at having another operation. ‚ÄúSo he could be having extended period out.

‚ÄúFor such a talented kid, who‚Äôs played in three Scorchers finals for us, he‚Äôs been part of Shield finals and (WA‚Äôs 2014-15) Matador Cup win, we‚Äôre going to look at the bigger picture for him.‚Äù, Langer concluded.

CAT 2017: This is how you need to start preparing for exam to get admission in IIMs,"CAT 2017: IIM Lucknow will be conducting the entrance examination CAT 2017: IIM Lucknow will be conducting the entrance examination

CAT 2017, which is going to be held on November 26, is now just three months away. CAT consists of three sections which are Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI & LR) and Quantitative Ability (QA). Each of these sections is allotted one hour and there are 100 questions altogether.

Important topics in each section

Quantitative Ability (QA): In QA, the majority of the questions come from algebra, number system and permutation and combination. Make sure that these topics are covered thoroughly by solving as many questions as possible from them. Getting comfortable with these topics would help you in boosting your confidence. Questions from geometry mostly have a short-cut method to solve them. Try to learn different short-cut methods to solve them while giving sectional tests.

Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC): In VARC, the majority of questions come from para-jumbles and Reading Comprehension (RC). Try to solve RC of different domains like psychology, science, economics, medicine. Getting comfortable while reading those passages from unfamiliar domains would help you in brushing up your understanding skills and help you prepare better.

Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DI & LR): LR & DI is all about practising and increasing your speed of solving. Try to sharpen up your mind by solving as many diverse questions as possible.

Keep these tips in mind while preparing for CAT 2017

Study regularly: In case you started your preparation recently, you need not worry. Instead, just focus on your preparation, without getting stressed out. Make sure that you study on a regular basis. It is important to study a minimum of 3-4 hours per day. In case you are doing a job along with your preparation, try to cut down on your sleep at night and study during that period.

Balance speed and accuracy: CAT is about balancing accuracy and speed at the same time which can be achieved only through maximum practice. In the initial phase of your preparation, try to focus more on accuracy rather than speed. Gradually, with time, try to increase your speed keeping your accuracy constant. Do not just focus on one section and prepare for that. It is important to solve questions of every section on a daily basis. It helps in keeping the speed and comfort with all the topics intact.

Cover all topics: Leaving out certain topics for CAT might not be a good strategy. You may lose out on an opportunity to score easy marks. In case you want to leave any topic during preparation, make sure that the topic should is not a very important one, for example, para-jumbles or permutation & combination.

Understand your strong and weak areas by giving sectional mocks: Since every section has its own cut-off, therefore it is important to know your strong and weak areas. In case you have just started your preparation, for the next couple of weeks, work on your concepts and understand them thoroughly. Also, give sectional mocks of these topics to understand how well acquainted you are with those topics. Just giving sectional mocks won‚Äôt help you a lot. It is even more important to see the solutions and analyse your performance and learn from your mistakes.

Attempt full-length mocks: The same thing goes for full-length mocks as well, where just giving too many mocks isn‚Äôt the best way to prepare. A substantial amount of time should be given to the analysis of those mocks. Also, the learning from those mocks should be absorbed and they should be carried forward into the next mock. You can practice sectional and full-length mocks on the gradeup app.

Look for the simplest method: At times, there are multiple ways to solve the same question. Try to solve the question by the shortest method using tricks and short-cuts. Make sure that you keep those tricks in mind for future use. Just solving a question by using a long method doesn‚Äôt do any good.

Take small breaks in between: It is sometimes necessary to take breaks in-between study while practising. This helps you to freshen up your mind and improve your efficiency.

Make a weekly study plan: Make a thirteen-week study plan in which the first six weeks should focus more on concept building and giving sectional mocks. The next seven weeks should focus more on giving full-length mocks and analysing them in detail. This would include working on your weak areas and making sure that you develop a certain level of comfort with those topics.

Sincere and dedicated efforts along with a smart study plan during these 3 months will surely help you get a seat in your dream B-school.

India ready for St Kitts & Nevis challenge in Hero Tri-Nation Football tournament,"Constantine said the good thing about this tournament was having two teams from different continents, who have different philosophy, style. (Source: Express Archive) Constantine said the good thing about this tournament was having two teams from different continents, who have different philosophy, style. (Source: Express Archive)

A buoyed Indian team will like to win their 10th international encounter on trot when they take on 125th ranked St Kitts and Nevis in their second round robin encounter of the Hero Tri-Nation Football tournament in Mumbai on Thursday.

The tournament is being seen as a preparatory one before India take on Macau in their Asian Cup qualifying encounter on September 5.

India in last few months have won eight official international game and an unofficial friendly against Bhutan.

Needing just a draw tomorrow to win the tournament, India have rested star striker Sunil Chhetri and number one goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu while Sandesh Jhingan will continue to lead the side.

India won the first match against 160th ranked Mauritius 2-1 after trailing by a goal. Seasoned duo of Robin Singh and Balwant Singh scored for the hosts.

Going with his youth policy, chief coach Stephen Constantine is expected to hand over senior team debut to a few more talented U-23 players after the trio of goalkeeper Amrinder Singh, Nikhil Pujary and Manvir Singh were blooded in the opening game.

Addressing reporters, Constantine said his side need to start a little bit stronger than the last game.

‚ÄúWe have tendency to start slow and that sometimes causes problem as it did with Mauritius. They got the first goal, even Puerto Rico (in an international friendly last year) got the first goal. We need to come out little bit quicker, that is one of the key areas. Defence is obviously is one of the key areas,‚Äù he said.

Constantine said the good thing about this tournament was having two teams from different continents, who have different philosophy, style.

‚ÄúSt Kitts and Nevis did a good job in containing Mauritius. They (St Kitts and Nevis) are quite dangerous especially on the counter attack and you could see in the goal (against Mauritius),‚Äù he said.

Asked whether some key players missing from St Kitts and Nevis line-up will make his job easier, the India coach replied in negative.

‚ÄúIt makes my job harder because the players who are here are doing to possibly everything they can to show that they should be here. There will be ISL clubs looking at these games. I would have preferred a fully-loaded (side) here,‚Äù Constantine quipped.

He also said that there should be an India Under-21 team in the I-League.

‚ÄúI said it 15 years ago, we should have Indian U-21 team in the I-League. Five years after I left (2010) they did it. We need an U-21 team, put into the I-League because there needs to be a legitimate pathway for players because young Indian players are not getting opportunities that they should be getting,‚Äù he said.

Constantine would want his team to play attacking brand of football and would certainly plug the loopholes pertaining to the first 15 minutes when the defence looked jittery.

Forwards Robin and Balwant would like to continue from where they left. The prolific Jeje Lalpekhlua and young Manvir, are also expected to play a crucial role, if India has to register their 10th win on the trot.

The Indian defence comprising the likes of skipper Sandesh Jhinghan, would play a crucial role in stopping the visitors‚Äô attack.

The midfield is expected to be marshalled by Eugeneson Lyngdon, Holicharan Narzari, Jerry Lalrinzuala and Udanta Singh, whom Constantine will expect to be consistent.

On the other hand, St Kitts and Nevis, who were held by a lower-ranked Mauritius to a 1-1 draw, would like to put up an inspired show against the favourites.

Their coach Jacques Passy said that they are facing a ‚Äútough opponent‚Äù tomorrow.

‚ÄúI have seen every game of India, since coach Constantine took over. India has improved dramatically, you know what to expect from India. It is clearly a team which defends brilliantly, a team that plays 4-4-2 combination always and a team that is very sharp with two strikers,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe know what we are going to face and which players we are going to face. We are going to face a team which has vision and that has won nine games in a row, we are expecting a tough game tomorrow,‚Äù Passy added.

The St Kitts and Nevis coach did not buy the argument that absence of Sunil Chettri and Gurpreet Singh Sandhu will make things easier for them.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy the story that because India‚Äôs top players are not playing tomorrow, it is going to be easier. The story that I buy is that I am facing an opponent that know how to play the game,‚Äù he signed off.

The match starts at 8 pm.

Use of glucocorticoids should be stopped completely: Fifa‚Äôs former chief medical officer,"Jiri Dvorak, has claimed that the steroids used by players like Carlos Tevez, Dirk Kuyt and Gabriel Heinze should be banned. (Source: youtube) Jiri Dvorak, has claimed that the steroids used by players like Carlos Tevez, Dirk Kuyt and Gabriel Heinze should be banned. (Source: youtube)

Fifa‚Äôs former chief medical officer, Jiri Dvorak, has claimed that the steroids used by players like Carlos Tevez, Dirk Kuyt and Gabriel Heinze should be banned. It may be recalled here that a couple of days earlier documents revealed by a hacker group stated that the above-mentioned footballers were among the 25 players who were given permission to take therapeutic use exemption (TUE).

Stating that glucocorticoids cause long-term damage, he said to BBC, ‚ÄúIt is a very potent drug. There can be serious side-effects. They can cover the symptoms but it is the long-term effect I am concerned about. At the moment, with an application for use, they are allowed. As a physician, I am against glucocorticoids ‚Äì their use should be stopped ‚Äì full stop. The lesson is not being learnt.

Recalling the earlier process of which Dvorak was a part off, he said, ‚ÄúWe had quite a strict process. We required full documentation to support the application, including medical documents. There were justified medical declarations to support the exemptions. We were happy everything was declared. But sometimes it depends on how the doctor is feeling whether he prescribes the steroids.‚Äù, Dvorak said and added, ‚ÄúI was always warning about the use of them and trying to educate people.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were happy everything was declared. But sometimes it depends on how the doctor is feeling whether he prescribes the steroids.‚Äù, Dvorak said and added, ‚ÄúI was always warning about the use of them and trying to educate people.‚Äù

Expressing confidence in Fifa‚Äôs current system, he added, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Fifa has changed the process since I left, so I am not worried that the system is being abused. When I look at other sports, like athletics and tournaments like the Olympics, compared to World Cups, we had far fewer TUEs in football.‚Äù

Premier League clubs smash own transfer spending record,"Romelu Lukaku was picked up by Manchester United from Everton. (Source: Reuters) Romelu Lukaku was picked up by Manchester United from Everton. (Source: Reuters)

Premier League clubs have broken their own spending record for the transfer window, a sports analyst group said on Wednesday, with more deals expected before business closes next Thursday.

Southampton‚Äôs 15 million pound ($19.19 million) purchase of Lazio centre back Wesley Hoedt brought the overall spend by England‚Äôs 20 elite clubs to 1.184.9 billion pounds, the respected website Sporting Intelligence said.

The figure exceeded the ¬£1.18 billion pounds the clubs spent in last summer‚Äôs window.

Across the 20 clubs, net spending stands at 565 million pounds, with 619.9 million pounds received. The figures do not include add-ons or agent fees.

Although the biggest deal of the window was done by French club Paris St Germain, who paid Barcelona 222 million euros ($261.58 million) for Neymar, English clubs have rivalled them for overall spend with Manchester City (221.5 million pounds) leading the way, ahead of Manchester United (145.8) and Everton (139.9).

Barcelona could yet emerge as the biggest spending club, however, with British and Spanish media reporting they are about to table a 138 million pound bid, including add-ons, for Liverpool‚Äôs Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho.

The Spanish club have already paid China‚Äôs Guangzhou Evergrande 40 million euros for Paulinho and been heavily linked with a move for Borussia Dortmund‚Äôs Ousmane Dembele.

Should the Coutinho deal go through, it would trigger a chain reaction with Liverpool reported to be interested in signing Southampton centre back Virgil van Dijk and Arsenal‚Äôs Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in deals that would exceed 100 million pounds.

"Dish TV to BCCI, government: Do not grant IPL rights to Star","Dish TV has pleaded against the broadcast rights of the Indian Premier League being granted to STAR network. Dish TV has pleaded against the broadcast rights of the Indian Premier League being granted to STAR network.

Dish TV, a direct-to-home service provider, has pleaded against the broadcast rights of the Indian Premier League being granted to STAR network, arguing that such an eventuality will create a monopolistic situation in the sports broadcasting market and force viewers and subscribers to pay very high subscription rates.

In a letter to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, BCCI CEO Rahul Johri, Committee of Administrators head Vinod Rai, Competition Commission of India and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, Dish TV‚Äôs chairman and managing director Jawahar Goel said that if STAR managed to acquire the IPL‚Äôs telecast rights in the auction, ‚Äúthe cost for the consumers is likely to increase manifold because of the creation of ‚Äòsole supplier‚Äô monopoly in the market.‚Äù

STAR already has rights to India‚Äôs home series, domestic cricket, all ICC tournaments, Asia Cup and home series of England, Australia and Bangladesh. ‚ÄúSTAR is aiming to acquire the IPL cricket telecast rights also and thereby attain the status of ‚Äòsole holder‚Äô of the telecast rights of all the major cricketing events‚Ä¶ The history of the media industry is witness to the fact that all the actions initiated by STAR till date have always been to economically concentrate the power through acquisition of cricket broadcast rights and thereby create a monopoly in the market to gain huge commercial advantage at the expense of the consumers and the distribution industry,‚Äù Goel alleged.

‚ÄùIn order to serve its long term objective of charging the exorbitant price for its sports channels containing cricketing content, STAR has challenged the authority/jurisdiction of TRAI itself to fix the price of TV channels and the matter is pending before the Hon‚Äôble High Court of Judicature at Madras.‚Äù Goel argues that in the eventuality of STAR acquiring the telecast rights of the IPL, the broadcaster will not only compel the distributors of TV channels, such as the DTH operators, to pay exorbitant price for their channels but also force the consumers to shell more. ‚ÄúSuch a situation would not only be anti-competitive but also anti-consumers.‚Äù

The letter wants the cricket board to keep these factors in mind before deciding on the rights for the IPL.

Pakistan-born man jailed for pipe bomb plot in UK,"A 43-year-old Pakistan-born man with an Italian passport has been sentenced to 18 years in prison in the UK . (Representational Photo) A 43-year-old Pakistan-born man with an Italian passport has been sentenced to 18 years in prison in the UK . (Representational Photo)

A 43-year-old Pakistan-born man with an Italian passport has been sentenced to 18 years in prison in the UK for trying to smuggle a pipe bomb onto a plane at Manchester Airport. Nadeem Muhammad had been convicted of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life at Manchester Crown Court earlier this month.

Judge Patrick Field, sentencing at the court yesterday, concluded there was no obvious motivation for Muhammad‚Äôs actions.

During his trial, prosecutors had presented evidence that Muhammad intended to detonate the device on a Boeing 737 flight to Bergamo, Italy.

The jury did not believe Muhammad‚Äôs claim in court that he had never seen the device before.

‚ÄúDespite extensive investigation, Nadeem Muhammad‚Äôs motive for attempting to take this device onto a plane remains unknown. However it is clear that the consequences, had he been successful, could have been disastrous,‚Äù said Sue Hemmings from the UK‚Äôs Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

The court was told that Muhammad was planning to board a Ryanair flight to Italy on January 30 this year when security officers uncovered the device, made of masking tape, batteries, the tube of a marker pen, pins and wires, in the zip lining of his small green suitcase.

Security officers at the airport had not initially believed the bomb was viable and, after being questioned by counter-terrorism police, Muhammad was released and allowed to board another flight to Bergamo, near Milan, five days later.

The device was later passed on to counter terrorism experts for examination, who found it to be a ‚Äúpotentially viable‚Äù bomb containing nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose. Muhammad was eventually arrested when he returned to the UK from Italy on February 12.

After sentencing, the judge said he was ‚Äúalarmed‚Äù about some of the evidence in the case and about ‚Äúthe lack of concern‚Äù expressed by both airport officials and police.

‚ÄúAirport security staff reached a wholly erroneous and potentially dangerous conclusion ‚Äì as a result one member of staff even put the device in her pocket and tested it in the shoe X-ray machine,‚Äù he said.

He said that had ‚Äúput herself and fellow employees and members of public at risk‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe situation was compounded when the police became involved because they too readily accepted it wasn‚Äôt dangerous and an early opportunity to arrest him was missed.‚Äù

Judge Field said there was ‚Äúa risk he (Muhammad) could have escaped justice altogether‚Äù and it was ‚Äúgood luck rather than good judgement‚Äù that ‚Äúthis matter came to a satisfactory conclusion‚Äù.

He noted: ‚ÄúIn these dangerous times there is no room for complacency and I hope security at Manchester Airport will be subject to a review at the highest level.‚Äù

A Manchester Airport spokesperson said: ‚ÄúSecurity is our number one priority and we work closely with (the) government, police and other agencies to provide passengers with a safe and secure environment.

‚ÄúIn this instance, our security team successfully detected a device hidden inside the lining of a suitcase. It was deemed to be a suspicious item and passed to police to investigate further.

‚ÄúThese actions prevented a potentially dangerous item being taken on board an aircraft and, ultimately, to a successful prosecution,‚Äù the spokesperson said.

Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said the airport and police have reviewed their security procedure.

From Vishal Sikka‚Äôs resignation to Nandan Nilekani‚Äôs appointment: Everything that has happened,"Nandan Nilekani was appointed as the Chairman of Infosys on Thursday. (File photo) Nandan Nilekani was appointed as the Chairman of Infosys on Thursday. (File photo)

Nandan Nilekani was appointed as the Chairman of Infosys on Thursday, days after Vishal Sikka‚Äôs resignation as the copany CEO and MD. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors of the company. ‚ÄúNilekani has been appointed as the non-executive, non-independent director and the chairman of the Board of Directors with immediate effect,‚Äù an Infosys official declaration to BSE, NSE and other international stock exchanges stated.

Former CEO, MD Vishal Sikka quit the board with R Seshasayee also stepping down from his position as the Chairman of the Board.

Here is everything that has happened since Vishal Sikka tendered his resignation:

Vishal Sikka‚Äôs resignation was accepted at a Board meeting on August 18. He was appointed as the executive vice-chairman and was reported to hold the position until the company‚Äôs new permanent Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director took charge, according to a statement released by Infosys on August 18. UB Pravin Rao was appointed as the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director reporting to Sikka, under the overall supervision and control of the company‚Äôs Board.

Sikka took charge as Infosys CEO in 2014, becoming the first chief executive officer who was not from one of its founders.

The Board of Directors blamed the founder N R Narayana Murthy for forcing Sikka‚Äôs exit. ‚ÄúMr. Murthy‚Äôs continuous assault is the primary reason that the CEO, Dr. Vishal Sikka, has resigned despite strong Board support‚Äô‚Äô. In response, Narayana Murthy had said that he was anguished by the allegations. ‚ÄúAnguished by allegations, tone and tenor of statements by Infosys board, below my dignity to respond to baseless insinuations.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy concern primarily was the deteriorating standard of corporate governance which I have repeatedly brought to the notice of the Infosys board,‚Äù he had said, adding he will reply to ‚Äòthese allegations in the right manner and in the right forum and at the appropriate time‚Äô.

Infosys shares dropped by close to 14 per cent in two days after Sikka resigned.

The company was faced with a big task of finding a replacement for Sikka, with insiders hinting that someone from within might be considered for the post. ‚ÄúI think there is very little chance there will be an external candidate,‚Äù a source inside the company had informed The Indian Express.

With friction continuing between founder NR Narayana Murthy and Board chairman R Seshasayee, sources at the company said that a restructuring might take place in the Board of Directors soon. Amid the feud between the Board and Narayana Murthy, company‚Äôs co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan on Tuesday called on finance and corporate affairs minister Arun Jaitley. Venkatesan is believed to have briefed Jaitley about the developments at Infosys and assured the minister of no let-up in corporate governance standards at the company, contrary to the allegations labelled by Murthy.

On Wednesday, The Indian Express reported that domestic institutions, led by some of the top mutual funds in the country, sought the return of former Infosys managing director and CEO Nandan Nilekani in a ‚Äúsuitable capacity‚Äù to restore the confidence of stakeholders in the tech company. According to reports by the newspaper, founders and former senior officials of the company had managed to persuade co-founder Nandan Nilekani to head India‚Äôs second-largest IT company.

The official announcement for the appointment was made on Thursday night.

Wu Lei‚Äôs double puts Shanghai SIPG on verge of Asian Champions League semis,"Wu Lei scored twice as Shanghai SIPG comfortably defeated two-time Asian Champions League winners Guangzhou Evergrande 4-0 on Tuesday in the first leg of their all-Chinese Super League quarter-final of the continental club championship.

Playing for the first time in the Asian Champions League since the departure of Brazilian midfielder Paulinho in a 40 million euro ($47 million) transfer to Barcelona last week, Evergrande were torn apart by Andre Villas-Boas‚Äô side, who are now one game away from their first appearance in the semi-finals of the competition.

‚ÄúSIPG deserved the win,‚Äù said Evergrande coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, whose team lead SIPG by eight points in the domestic standings.

‚ÄúWe paid the price for the tight and intensive match schedule. We also paid the price for the absence of Paulinho, Huang Bowen and Mei Fang and we were playing against such a strong opponent.‚Äù

SIPG controlled the opening half hour, but were only able to find a breakthrough in the 38th minute when Hulk scored from the penalty spot after Zhang Linpeng had bundled Wu Lei over in the area.

A minute into first half stoppage time, SIPG doubled their lead when Wang Shenchao was left unattended from close range to head in Hulk‚Äôs curling cross from the left.

Wu claimed his first goal of the game in the 62nd minute after linking up with substitute Elkeson, who heeled a return ball into the path of the China international who then fired his shot past Guangzhou goalkeeper Zeng Cheng.

Two minutes later, Wu struck again to leave Evergrande with a mountain to climb when the teams meet on September 12, as he finished off a rapid break led by Hulk.

‚ÄúOur players deserved the win,‚Äù said Villas-Boas.

‚ÄúWe have had a very difficult time in the Chinese Super League but today we overcame lots of obstacles and had an excellent game. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been chasing Evergrande all the time. We have to keep in mind that there is the away game to go. Evergrande is a team that keeps winning games all the time.‚Äù

In the western half of the draw, last year‚Äôs runners-up Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates were held to a 0-0 draw by Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Al Hilal in their quarter-final first leg.

The two teams will face each other again on September 11, with the winner meeting either Iran‚Äôs Persepolis or Al Ahli, also of Saudi Arabia.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to say who is closer,‚Äù said Al Ain head coach Zoran Mamic after the draw in front of his club‚Äôs own fans. ‚ÄúWe are satisfied with this result.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt concede a goal, which is very important. And after three weeks I‚Äôm sure my team will be much more ready.‚Äù

"India vs Sri Lanka, 2nd ODI: Virat Kohli hints at continuing with same team combination","Virat Kohli-led Indian team defeated Sri Lanka by 9 wickets in first ODI. (Source: AP) Virat Kohli-led Indian team defeated Sri Lanka by 9 wickets in first ODI. (Source: AP)

India are all set to take on Sri Lanka in the second match of the five-match series at Pallekele. After thumping the hosts by 9 wickets, The Virat Kohli-led side would now be eyeing to stretch their lead in this second encounter and the Indian skipper Virat Kohli on Wednesday hinted on continuing with the same team combination as first ODI.

‚ÄúWicket similar to Dambulla. I don‚Äôt see any reason to change team just after 1 game but everything and any combination is possible,‚Äù said Virat Kohli.

Kohli also talked about the roles of the players in the team, he said that the upcoming season is an opportunity for every member to define their roles.

This coming season gives us an opportunity to define roles for players and give them time to execute it so that for the World Cup, we know exactly what one player needs to do in certain situations,‚Äù Kohli told

‚ÄúAnd it helps someone like MS also because he doesn‚Äôt play Test cricket anymore. This long streak of matches will help him be in touch with the international games, find some momentum and stick to it,‚Äù Kohli added.

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs an opportunity for everyone in the team including MS to create good habits and sustain them over a period of time,‚Äù the skipper said.

Axar Patel was picked up in the playing XI in first match of the series in Dambulla and speaking about opting for Patel over Kuldeep Yadav, Kohli told that apart from his bowling, Axar is good with the bat as well as pretty good in the field.

‚ÄúIt was a case of having two left-arm spinners that led us not playing Kuldeep in the first game. Axar was favoured more than Kuldeep from the point of view that he bats quite well and he is a gun (great) in the field also. Kuldeep has got opportunities in the past,‚Äù he said.

‚Äú(Yuzvendra) Chahal and Axar are guys who haven‚Äôt got many opportunities so we want to test them out. It‚Äôs all about giving opportunities to people which we feel will not hamper our plans in any way and at the same time, it‚Äôs about giving them exposure at international cricket,‚Äù he further added.

Mentioning Kuldeep‚Äôs abilities, Virat suggested that a player like him is always a ‚Äúboost‚Äù for the team.

‚ÄúKuldeep remains in the thick of things all the time. To have a guy like that in the team is always a boost. You might see two wrist spinners playing together if we feel that we don‚Äôt need that much depth in the batting in the coming games,‚Äù said the skipper.

The Indian skipper also talked about Hardik Pandya and how consistent he is with the ball.

‚ÄúHardik has the ability to swing the ball and he can bowl consistently over 135 km/hr. With the new ball, he can get a bit of extra bounce because of his height. He has bowled with the new ball in India against England and against New Zealand in a few games as well. We certainly look at it as a great option for us,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBeing the fifth bowler in the team, we can get four-five overs out of the way in the first 10, when the ball is swinging. Also Jasprit Bumrah is our strike bowler and he comes in one-change. The teams obviously will be a bit more wary against him so that really gives us good balance in terms of whom to use when,‚Äù he added.

"Deepika Padukone, Katrina Kaif or Patralekha ‚Äî Who aced colour blocking?","Colour blocking with pink and red is very difficult to pull off, but Patralekha has given it a new spin with a tangerine hue. (Source: Patralekhaa/Instagram, File Photo, File Photo) Colour blocking with pink and red is very difficult to pull off, but Patralekha has given it a new spin with a tangerine hue. (Source: Patralekhaa/Instagram, File Photo, File Photo)

Recently, Bollywood beauty Deepika Padukone made a colour-blocking statement when she wore a red velvet oriental print dress with hot pink wide-legged pants from Zara. The look failed to impress because the red and pink colour blocking technique, which is really hard to pull off, didn‚Äôt work out for this beauty. The separates are beautiful on their own but teamed together, they look jarring. But Patralekha Mishra Paul, the ‚ÄòCitylights‚Äô actor who chose to go for a similar look managed to pull it off beautifully.

Unlike Padukone, Paul chose to colour block her hot pink high-neck top from Zara with a flared tangerine skirt from Forever New. Styled by Devki B, she chose to play down the colour game with a pair of nude heels, a soft pink pout and a top-knot hair bun with cute bangs.

Colour-blocking has been a celebrity favourite for a while now. Katrina Kaif too, was seen in a pink-and-red dress by Jill Jill Stuart during a press meet while promoting Fitoor in 2016. She chose the same colours like Padukone, and failed to create an impact. While this is closer home, international stars like Taylor Swift and Beyonc√© have also flaunted the colour blocking fashion technique with elan. Among them, it is Taylor Swift‚Äôs popular number that will remain our favourite.

"Donald Trump commits US to open-ended Afghanistan war, Taliban vow ‚Äògraveyard‚Äô: Top developments","U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, U.S., August 21, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, U.S., August 21, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday committed US troops to an open-ended war in Afghanistan, a decision the Afghanistan government welcomed. Taliban has, however, warned that this decision by the United States of America would make the country a ‚Äúgraveyard for the American empire‚Äù. Trump also vowed to step up military campaign against the Taliban. He also blamed Pakistan for harbouring terrorists in safe havens on its soil. US officials said Trump has signed off on Defense Secretary James Mattis‚Äô plans to despatch around 4,000 more troops to Afghanistan.

Here is what has happened in the past 24 hours:

1. In a statement to Reuters, US President Donald Trump said his original instinct was to pull out all US troops. But after a lengthy review with his military advisers about the US‚Äô longest war he was convinced.

2. ‚ÄúThe consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum that terrorists, including ISIS and al Qaeda, would instantly fill.‚Äù

3. Trump reiterated that although US‚Äô troops will fight to win, he asserted that eventually Afghanistan‚Äôs police and army must to most of the fighting to defeat the Taliban and allied Islamist militants. ‚ÄúThe stronger the Afghan security forces become, the less we will have to do. ‚Ä¶ We want them to succeed.‚Äù

4. Approximately 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan work closely with a NATO-led training and advising mission. The rest are a part of a counter-terror operation that mostly targets pockets of Al-Qaeda and Islamic State terrorists.

5. Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday welcomed the US strategy saying it would expand the training mission for Afghan forces. ‚ÄúI am grateful to President Trump and the American people for this affirmation of support ‚Ä¶ for our joint struggle to rid the region from the threat of terrorism,‚Äù Ghani said in a statement.

6. The Taliban condemned US President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision saying: ‚ÄúIf the U.S. does not pull all its forces out of Afghanistan, we will make this country the 21st century graveyard for the American empire.‚Äù

7. The United States-backed Afghanistan forces overthrew the Taliban‚Äôs hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 over its sheltering of al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, primary architect architect of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in U.S. cities that killed nearly 2,000 people.

8. US‚Äô involvement in the Afghanistan war has however created problems for three presidents. Around 2,400 US troops have been killed in action in Afghanistan ever since.

9. Trump asserted that he would not engage in nation building even as he warned that US‚Äô support ‚Äúis not a blank check‚Äù for Afghanistan‚Äôs corruption-plagued government.

10. Trump also slammed Pakistan for providing safe haven to terrorists. ‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens,‚Äù he said, referring to complaints that Taliban and other militants move freely in Pakistan.

"We, the People: Sketching illustrations for the Constitution of India","A total of 22 illustrations were designed for the Constitution of India. (Source: Express Archive Photo) A total of 22 illustrations were designed for the Constitution of India. (Source: Express Archive Photo)

While the founding fathers of the Constitution were framing the laws that would govern India, miles from the capital, Delhi, Nandalal Bose and his students in Santiniketan were sketching illustrations that would feature in the manuscript, and would encapsulate India‚Äôs rich history, diversity and unity. It was Jawaharlal Nehru who had reportedly proposed that Bose work on the Constitution of India, where the text, too, was handwritten by calligrapher Prem Behari Narain Raizada in flowing italic.

For the world‚Äôs longest written Constitution ‚Äî now carefully kept in the library of the Parliament of India ‚Äî Bose and his team designed a total of 22 illustrations. Borrowing from Indian miniature tradition, Ajanta frescoes and what came to be defined as the Santiniketan style, intricate frames surround the text. The depictions span different periods. If the initial part has the popular Indus Valley seal mark, the Zebu bull, the Vedic period is represented by a scene from gurukul. We see scenes from various eras, including the Mauryan and Mughal empire, and the dancing Nataraja from the Chola tradition. The freedom movement is portrayed with a figure of Mahatma Gandhi during the Dandi March, and another frame has Subhash Chandra Bose.

Our epics find representation, too. From the Ramayana, there is Ram, Lakshman and Sita returning home; a scene from the Mahabharata has Krishna and Arjun in conversation. Buddha and Mahavira are also part of the Constitution, where the varied geographical terrain of India is also celebrated.

"Ghatkopar collapse: Inquiry report, says making illegal changes to buildings should be made cognisable offence","The four-storey building collapsed on July 25, killing 17 people. The collapse was allegedly triggered by the alterations being carried out on the ground floor. Express file The four-storey building collapsed on July 25, killing 17 people. The collapse was allegedly triggered by the alterations being carried out on the ground floor. Express file

NEARLY a month after the Siddhi Sai building in Ghatkopar collapsed killing 17 people, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation‚Äôs inquiry report has held that Sunil Shitap, who owned three flats on the ground floor, had carried out unauthorised work that caused the building to fall.

The report has also made several recommendations to prevent such incidents, including amendment of the Indian Penal Code to recognise making of structural changes without permission as a cognisable offence, and introducing a software to track structural audits.

Citing the report of the independent structural engineer, Chetan Raikar of Structwel Designers and Consultants, as well as the statement of the residents of the building and civic officials of the N ward office, the three-member panel concluded that the accused Sunil Shitap was to be held directly responsible for the collapse of the building.

The report stated that Shitap had made alterations to the structure around 18-20 days before its collapse. The committee further observed that ‚Äúall internal walls on the ground floor were found removed without carrying out any scientifically designed propping of the structure‚Äù.

The three-member panel headed by additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal has made 13 recommendations to prevent such incidents, all of which have been accepted by civic chief Ajoy Mehta.

The measures include making amendments to the Indian Penal Code to hold the occupant fully responsible for carrying out structural changes or repairs without permission from the planning authority. The report suggests that such an offence be considered cognisable one and all structural repairs be done under the strict supervision of structural consultants.

Mehta has directed deputy municipal commissioner Suhas Karvande and director (engineering services and projects) Vinod Chitore to ensure that all the recommendations are implemented within the next six months.

Mehta has also asked Singhal to take disciplinary action as suggested by the committee. He has asked deputy municipal commissioner Narendra Barde to ensure that all illegal constructions carried out by Shitap are demolished and strict action initiated against him.

The panel also recommended setting up a separate cell that can be responsible for a software to monitor structural audit of buildings over 30 years old and initiate action against defaulters. Another recommendation cites the need for another cell to oversee the work on dilapidated buildings.

Changing the current system of self certification ‚Äî where owners can renovate their property as long as they submit certain documents including a structural engineer‚Äôs certificate ‚Äî the panel suggests making it mandatory for owners to submit a no-objection certificate from the society for tenantable repairs. The copy of the NOC will have to be forwarded by the housing society to the designated ward officer.

The panel has suggested that henceforth, interior designers would have to be registered, since they may tamper with the structure of the building in the name of aesthetics.

Structural audit reports submitted by consultants will be standardised and the civic body will issue minimum parameters to ascertain the structural well-being of a building. The recommendations also cite the need for a new post of ‚ÄòTechnical Assistant‚Äô, who will be responsible for detecting illegal additions of alteration work in various wards. Additionally, occupation certificate or completion certificate shall be made mandatory before issuing permission for any alteration work.

The Empire Gazes Back,"Applying Edward Said‚Äôs thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler‚Äôs Gaze is about. Applying Edward Said‚Äôs thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler‚Äôs Gaze is about.

In 1978, the Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said published a seminal treatment of how the Western world and its scholarship viewed the Islamic world of the Middle East. His central argument was: knowledge is embedded in equations of power and all Western scholarship on nonwestern societies is tainted by its association with imperialism. Power therefore defined knowledge. The reception of ‚ÄòOrientalism‚Äô is not surprising. The 1970s was an era when the west seemed to be rolling back. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan followed in 1979. The Shia revolution in Iran in the same year was as much an ideological and intellectual revolution against the West and the USA as a political revolution against the Shah. The spread of extremism and Islamic fundamentalism elsewhere challenged then, as it does now, deeply engrained notions of what constituted progress in Western eyes. Said‚Äôs book Orientalism became a classic, as it remains to this day.

Academic critiques of Said were no less powerful. Substantial parts of the book delved into periods when the Islamic world was not subordinated to the West. So, perceptions of Islam as degenerate and backward did not develop as a consequence of Western conquest but, in fact, had predated it. Said‚Äôs argument about power and knowledge was much criticised on this ground. But even at that time, there was the view that the perfect match to study the relationship between imperial power and knowledge was to be found not so much in the middle east but in colonial India.

Applying Edward Said‚Äôs thesis of Orientalism to British colonial scholarship on India is what The Ruler‚Äôs Gaze is about. Arvind Sharma is a professor of comparative religion in Montreal. This is, in part, an assimilative work drawing on a wide range of studies in the past quarter-century, which have asked questions like those he raises: How did colonial scholarship evolve, and how did the process of studying colonial subjects and themes also transform the colonies in greater or lesser measure? This is a book refreshingly free of jargon ‚Äî it‚Äôs a good point for the serious but general reader to start with to understand how much colonialism and imperialism permeated scholarship, and how very clearly the relationship between knowledge and power was understood by both sets of practitioners.

Sharma describes, as others have before him, how scholarship about India and Indians changed as the East India Company transformed itself from a trading enterprise to a political and then a colonial power. The initial fascination, even admiration, for India and things Indians, acquired through the 19th century gave way, especially after 1857, to deep biases arising from a sense of contempt. He also does well to remind us how intrinsic missionary activity was to the entire imperial project as critiques of Hinduism went hand in hand with efforts at conversion. Racism also permeated colonial scholarship to a greater extent than is generally conceded. I found one particular instance cited by Sharma striking. Annette Beveridge, wife of a British civil servant and scholar, was an accomplished Persian scholar in her own right. Her translation of Gulbadan Begum‚Äôs Humayun Namah in the late 19th century is a work of great sensitivity and charm, as a woman of the time sought to understand and contextualise the account of a Mughal princess in the 17th century. But Beveridge was also at the forefront of the agitation in India insisting that Indian judges not be allowed to try English or white people. Beveridge then wrote about the social ideas of Hindus as being ‚Äúon the outer verge of civilisation‚Äù and that she had no hesitation in calling them ‚Äúuncivilised a people which cares about stone idols, enjoys child marriage and secludes its women, and where at every point the fact of sex is present to the mind.‚Äù In brief, how could such people be allowed to try English men and women!

Nevertheless, this is not a book about the inequities of British rule in India (although there is some of that) but rather about how British scholarship was an exercise underwritten by power and at the same time directed at cementing a relationship of subjugation. Illustrating how such scholarship also transformed social realities in India is one of Sharma‚Äôs endeavors, as he takes us through themes of caste, race, religion, science, historical sense or lack of it, etc. If parts of this treatment would be familiar to scholars, there is also sufficient that is new and surprising enough to engage the general reader.

Sharma‚Äôs central thesis of power underwriting scholarship in colonial India is unexceptional. Nevertheless, his extension of Said‚Äôs Orientalism debate to India also raises other questions. Did Orientalism cease in 1947 with the end of political subjugation? Or does this approach continue, since in many ways the relationship between India and the West continues to have elements that are unequal. More problematic are the questions thrown up by Sharma‚Äôs suggestions that political domination is the key variable in determining perceptions. This explanation, however appealing, may also have limitations. What was characteristic about British scholarship of India in the colonial period was not just that the British ruled India. It was also the fact that the rulers came from a society and an age that had, since the Enlightenment, radically transformed ideas of knowledge and how it was to be collected, organised and disseminated. This gave to knowledge production in colonial India features not encountered in earlier and other situations of political domination.

The Ruler‚Äôs Gaze is a thought provoking and imaginative work that furthers the debate about how profoundly British colonialism affected India and Indians.

"Tax, in the bigger picture","GST avoids the challenge of shifting to a higher proportion of direct taxes (PTI) GST avoids the challenge of shifting to a higher proportion of direct taxes (PTI)

Understanding is not merely a product of objective analysis. It needs a perspective as well. The national debate on GST is a case in point. GST can not be admired and criticised merely based on Rs 10 or Rs15 toothpaste and shampoo. It has to be weighed upon a broader taxation policy perspective. The question at stake is the viability of taxation policy as a whole, which is a reflection of economic policy, and, in turn, the approach towards its duties by the state itself.

India‚Äôs tax-GDP ratio is 18 per cent which compares miserably when with developed countries (between 30 per cent and 40 per cent) as well as comparable economies such as Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa (between 23 per cent and 26 per cent). India, on the launch pad of development, has to attain a thrust by improving upon this figure to reach a target of 25 per cent.

Second, of the total taxes collected in India, almost two-thirds come from indirect taxes while taxes on income and profits contribute only a one-third share. This is exactly in the opposite proportion when compared to other nations. In terms of healthy economic development as well as social policy objectives, such a low base of direct taxes and a high proportion of indirect taxes is the recipe for an adverse future. It is with this perspective on taxation policy, that we must assess GST.

First, some positives of GST regime. Under reporting of turnover and evasion of taxes on goods and services is the first step towards evasion of taxes on profits and income. With a greater convergence of direct and indirect tax departments and also due to the creation non-erasable automated electronic trails by GST, it will not be easy for the business class to default on direct taxes. With GST, there will be a tremendous pull and push to be a registered and tax compliant business unit rather than remain an unregistered seller due to the peculiar system of tax input credit.

However, in spite of the great potential, the decisions with regard to tax rates and the exclusions made by the GST council are, thus far, disappointing than promising. Although it appears that India‚Äôs GST rate is broken down into four rates ‚Äî 5, 12, 18, and 28 per cent ‚Äî the reality shows that at least seven rates would be in operation. This will not only defy the basic winning point of GST ‚Äî ‚Äúone nation one tax‚Äù ‚Äî but also increase the possibility of corruption and falsification due to a multiple-slab, loophole-prone tax system. Surprisingly, some glaring absurdities are seen in the classification of items. Gold, which as a fully imported item creates nothing but current account deficits and acts as a frequent destination for black money, has been allotted only 3 per cent GST and diamonds, 0.25 per cent. Meanwhile, essentials like sanitary napkins and medicines are to attract 5, 12 or 18 per cent GST.

Certain items such as petroleum, electricity and taxes on liquor ‚Äî which constitute a major chunk of states‚Äô income ‚Äî are kept away from the purview of the almighty GST. It should be noted that the taxes on refined petroleum products in the country constitute about 40 per cent (diesel) to 56 per cent (petrol) of their retail prices. In the last three years in particular, there has been a rise of 122 per cent in the indirect tax collection from the petroleum sector. The exclusion of the petroleum sector from GST is not only travesty of justice, it also indicates the intention of the government to cling to its reliance on indirect taxes as the principal source of taxation rather than shifting to direct taxes.

In Malaysia, more than a year was given to industry to prepare for the tax change. New Zealand gave about two years. With GST, the fear is that a lack of preparedness may lead to near-term disruption for businesses and unnecessary chaos, as a large number of mid-size cities in India lack reliable internet access. Overall, internet penetration in India is at merely 32.8 per cent, out of which only 15.4 per cent is the rural population. Due to lack of infrastructural preparedness, there could be a temporary obstruction in small and medium businesses.

From a deeper exploration, it is clear that taxation, rather than just being an issue of ascertaining the exact liability of tax and its enforcement, is also a matter of discovery and voluntary disclosure. For various cultural as well as social-historical reasons, the tax psychology in India is of avoidance rather than compliance. GST uses a unique modified deterrent behavioural model, wherein it promotes tax compliance behaviour as a compulsion along with a self-profiting motive. However, to shift from non-compliance to compliance we need a paradigm shift in culture, which is completely overlooked in any discussion on GST. It is necessary to make India embrace a tax compliant business and social model which would make tax evasion a social offence and a matter of shame rather than a badge of smartness. The awareness of this gigantic task is not seen anywhere in the political race for credit, led by the ruling party.

Tribal coalition joins blitz to save national monument areas,"Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke rides a horse in the new Bears Ears National Monument near Blanding, Utah.

(Scott G Winterton/The Deseret news via AP, file) Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke rides a horse in the new Bears Ears National Monument near Blanding, Utah. Conservation groups are airing TV ads, planning rallies and creating parody websites in a last-minute blitz to persuade Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to refrain from reducing or eliminating large swaths of land across the country that have been designated as national monuments, Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2017. (Scott G Winterton/The Deseret news via AP, file)

Conservation and tribal groups are airing TV ads, sending letters to President Donald Trump and creating parody websites in a last-minute blitz to stop Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke from downsizing or eliminating national monument areas that cover large swaths of land and water from Maine to California.

The deadline for Zinke to announce his recommendations is Thursday following a four-month review of 27 sites ordered by President Donald Trump.

A tribal coalition that pushed for the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, designated by President Barack Obama in December, unveiled a new webpage Tuesday that explains the cultural importance of lands considered sacred to them. They also posted a letter sent to President Trump telling him that part of ‚Äúmaking American great again‚Äù is honoring tribal history and rights.

‚ÄúAt a time when the United States feels anything but united under the shadow of Charlottesville, Virginia, please hear our voices,‚Äù wrote Willie Grayeyes, chairman of the coalition. ‚ÄúThese sacred lands have held our song, our stories, and our prayers since time beyond memory, and these lands will continue to hold the promise of our future.‚Äù

Zinke‚Äôs recommendations for the 27 national monument areas under review could eliminate some of them altogether or in some cases shrink them in size by opening them to commercial uses such as mining, grazing of livestock or oil drilling.

The outdoor recreation industry has hammered home its message that peeling back protections on areas where its customers hike, bike and camp could prevent future generations from enjoying the sites.

In addition, the Wilderness Society has created a parody website featuring Trump and Zinke selling luxury real estate at the lands.

Groups that want to see the areas reduced have been less vociferous, pleading their cases on social media and working behind the scenes to lobby federal officials.

They say past presidents have misused a century-old law to create monument areas that are too large and stop energy development, grazing, mining and other uses.

Stan Summers, a Utah county commissioner who chairs a group that advocates for the multi-use of public lands, said outdoor recreation companies are peddling lies and misconceptions when they say local officials want to bulldoze monument lands.

Summers said residents treasure the lands that comprise Bears Ears and the Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments in Utah, but don‚Äôt want to close the areas to new oil drilling and mining that produce good jobs.

‚ÄúWe want to tend this area like a garden instead of a museum,‚Äù he said

The review includes sweeping sites mostly in the West that are home to ancient cliff dwellings, towering sequoia trees, deep canyons or ocean habitats roamed by seals, whales and sea turtles.

Zinke has already removed six areas in Montana, Colorado, Idaho and Washington from consideration for changes. He also said Bears Ears on tribal land in Utah should be downsized.

Zinke on Thursday is scheduled to be in his home state of Montana with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue for a briefing on the state‚Äôs raging wildfires. No announcement on the fate of the monuments is planned during the visit, said Zinke spokeswoman Heather Swift.

Environmental groups said the 1906 Antiquities Act is intended to shield significant historical and archaeological sites, and that it allows presidents to create the monuments but only gives Congress the power to modify them.

They have vowed to file lawsuits if Trump attempts to rescind or reduce the monument designations.

No other president has tried to eliminate a monument, but they have trimmed and redrawn boundaries 18 times, according to the National Park Service.

REI and Patagonia have joined a group of 350 outdoor companies, including The North Face, YETI Coolers and Orvis, in signing a letter sent last week to Zinke by the Outdoor Industry Association.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an American right to roam in our public lands,‚Äù the letter reads. ‚ÄúAs business leaders, we simply ask that your final report remain true to the Teddy Roosevelt values we share with you _ to maintain the national treasures presidents of both parties have protected.‚Äù

Patagonia recently ran a TV ad in Montana and Utah with company founder Yvon Chouinard fishing and declaring, ‚ÄúOur business is built on having wild places‚Äù and warning that public lands are under the greatest threat ever.

Led by U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico, monument supporters plan a rally Thursday at an REI store in Albuquerque.

The Wilderness Society website also features a photo of ancient ruins at Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and the words, ‚ÄúDeveloper ready.‚Äù Each monument was given a fictional price tag, such as $932 million for Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in New Mexico.

In a description of Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine, the website says: ‚ÄúThis is the chance for someone to claim a little piece of that offbeat New England charm for themselves and leave hikers, birdwatchers, snowshoers and hunters on the outside, looking in!‚Äù

Proponents of downsizing the monuments say state governments are better suited to make management decisions that would ensure federal lands are used for a mix of uses.

‚ÄúThe only reason there is roads in some of these places is because of the mining and the oil and the gravel pits,‚Äù Summers said.

"At 45%, Bawana sees lowest poll turnout in 19 years","Bypolls to the Bawana seat in New Delhi. (Express Photo/Praveen Khanna) Bypolls to the Bawana seat in New Delhi. (Express Photo/Praveen Khanna)

On a rainy Wednesday, voting began sluggishly in Bawana ‚Äî and stayed that way as the day progressed. The constituency witnessed the lowest voter turnout in 19 years ‚Äî with only 45% of the total voters casting their ballot by 6 pm. The bypoll was necessitated after AAP MLA Ved Prakash defected to the BJP ahead of municipal body elections.

The first hour saw only 8% voting, which rose to 35% by 3 pm and ended at 45% by 6 pm. For Bawana ‚Äî a reserved seat with 26 rural villages that have traditionally voted for BJP and unauthorised colonies, and slum clusters that have voted for the Congress and, more recently, the AAP ‚Äî the voter turnout is key, all three parties maintained.

‚ÄúThe voting pattern here changed in 1998 when the massive migration from UP and Bihar shifted the electoral advantage away from the BJP to the Congress. Our candidate, Surender Kumar, won continuously from 1998 to 2013,‚Äù said a senior Congress leader.

Reasons for the low turnout varied. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs raining, but we have come out to vote in the rain before. Perhaps people are just tired. There have been four elections in the last four years, politics has become a joke,‚Äù said Mohammad Irfan, a resident of Shahbad Dairy.

Others said that in spite of the government ordering closure of factories at Bawana Industrial Area, many units remained open, which could have led to ‚Äòdisillusionment‚Äô. With voter turnout more pronounced in the densely populated ‚Äòcolonies‚Äô, where both Congress and AAP claim to hold sway, political calculations of both parties went astray.

Voting in villages will be key for AAP, which hopes to reverse its fortunes after defeats in the Punjab and Goa assembly polls and the MCD elections. ‚ÄúAAP had promised Rs 2 crore to each village here, a total of Rs 52 crore as part of the Smart Village scheme. It remains to be seen whether that translates to votes,‚Äù said an AAP leader.

AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj admitted that ‚Äúlow voter turnout is not good news‚Äù. ‚ÄúAll reports we have received indicate we are still leading,‚Äù he said. The Congress said that ‚Äúlow voter turnout makes it difficult to make predictions‚Äù. Party spokesperson Sharmistha Mukherjee added, ‚ÄúWe have made massive inroads in the area and our feedback has been very good.‚Äù

BJP leader Vijender Gupta said, ‚ÄúThe turnout has been low. But for a bypoll, this is expected. We are not worried. People are tired of AAP and their gimmicks.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe entire polling process went on peacefully and no untoward incident was reported from any part of the constituency,‚Äù Chief Electoral Officer Chandra Bhushan Kumar said.

Privacy of children requires special protection in a digital age so they are not subjected to consequences of their mistakes and naivety, the Supreme Court today said. Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, in his 47-page separate but concurring judgment holding that right to privacy, is a fundamental right, also observed that children are perpetually creating digital footprints on social networking websites as they learn their ABCs ‚Äì ‚ÄúApple, Bluetooth, and Chat‚Äù.

‚ÄúChildren around the world create perpetual digital footprints on social network websites on a 24/7 basis as they learn their ‚ÄòABCs‚Äô: Apple, Bluetooth, and Chat followed by Download, E-Mail, Facebook, Google, Hotmail, and Instagram.

‚ÄúThey should not be subjected to the consequences of their childish mistakes and naivety their entire life. Privacy of children will require special protection not just in the context of the virtual world, but also the real world,‚Äù Justice Kaul said.

The judge observed that technology results almost in a sort of a permanent storage in some way or the other making it difficult to begin life again giving up past mistakes.

‚ÄúPeople are not static, they change and grow through their lives. They evolve. They make mistakes. But they are entitled to re-invent themselves and reform and correct their mistakes. It is privacy which nurtures this ability and removes the shackles of inadvisable things which may have been done in the past,‚Äù he said.

Air India expects to mop up at least Rs 500 crore from the sale of these properties, which will go under the hammer in September, according to a senior airline official.

Air India has put up for sale as many as 27 flats besides several residential and commercial land plots as well as office buildings across the country as part of its snail-paced asset monetisation plan amid the disinvestment process of the debt-ridden flag carrier. The state-run auctioneer MSTC has been mandated to e-auction these properties, with bid closing date fixed for September 6.

According to a public notice, the airline has sought bids for sale of properties in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Ahmedabad, Pune, Goa, Lucknow, Gwalior, Gurgaon and Bhuj. Air India expects to mop up at least Rs 500 crore from the sale of these properties, which will go under the hammer in September, according to a senior airline official.

Chalked out in 2012 as part of the national carrier‚Äôs Turnaround/Financial Restructuring Plan, which provides for equity infusion in the airline worth Rs 30,231 crore up to 2021, AI is required to monetise its assets and generate Rs 5,000 crore by way of sale, leasing or developing an asset as a joint venture. However, so far, the carrier has been able to sell only four of its flats in Mumbai to SBI for about Rs 90 crore.

As part of efforts to revive the national carrier, the Cabinet has given in-principle approval for divestment and the final contours are being worked out by a group of ministers, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. The group has been mandated to look into various aspects related to AI. It would look into the treatment of unsustainable debts of the national carrier, hiving off certain assets to a shell company and de-merger and strategic disinvestment of three profit-making subsidiaries, among others.

Recently, the government told the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture a Parliamentary panel that Air India‚Äôs current business is ‚Äúnot sustainable‚Äù as it is neither able to generate enough cash flow nor start repaying even the principal amount on its debt.

The airline‚Äôs total debt stood at Rs 48,876.81 crore at the end of March 2017, of which Rs 17,359.77 crore is aircraft loans and the rest Rs 31,517.04 crore capital loans. The state-run airline‚Äôs net loss after tax narrowed to Rs 3,643 crore, while operating profit rose to Rs 300 crore in the last financial year.

MMRDA car depot: Centre‚Äôs nod for transfer of Airports Authority of India plot in Mumbai,"Since the Dahisar East-Andheri East corridor and the Dahisar-DN Nagar-Mandale corridor will be linked at Dahisar, they will have common depots at Mandale and Charkop as well. (Representational Image) Since the Dahisar East-Andheri East corridor and the Dahisar-DN Nagar-Mandale corridor will be linked at Dahisar, they will have common depots at Mandale and Charkop as well. (Representational Image)

The Union Cabinet has given its approval for transfer of a 40-acre Airports Authority of India (AAI) plot in Dahisar to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to build a metro car depot, MMRDA officials confirmed on Wednesday.

AAI currently uses the land for a remote receiving station. The station provides signal connectivity for uninterrupted communication between the Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower and the pilots.

‚ÄúThere will be a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Airports Authority of India (AAI), Government of Maharashtra (GoM) and MMRDA. In exchange of the Dahisar land, the state will provide an alternative land to the AAI in Gorai and the MMRDA will pay the difference in the amount. MMRDA will also foot the costs that AAI will incur during shifting,‚Äù said a senior MMRDA official.

The depot at Dahisar will have eight stabling lines, two inspection lines and a washing plant and will be shared between Metro 7, 2A and 2B. ‚ÄúBy 2055 we will have 90 trains of eight coaches each and over the years we will increase the capacity of the depot. The 40-acre plot will also house a depot control centre and maintenance offices,‚Äù said another senior official.

Since the Dahisar East-Andheri East corridor and the Dahisar-DN Nagar-Mandale corridor will be linked at Dahisar, they will have common depots at Mandale and Charkop as well.

"Ram Vilas Paswan, Kushwaha hail OBC quota sub-categorisation","Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan (PTI) Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan (PTI)

HAILING THE government‚Äôs decision on sub-categorisation of the OBC quota as ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù, Union ministers from Bihar Ram Vilas Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha, both votaries of Mandal politics, said this would help empower the most backward classes that are lagging in reaping reservation benefits. The decision could have a cascading effect on the political course in many states, including Bihar, where the benefits of OBC reservation have been mostly corned by a few dominant castes among the OBCs.

Paswan, a Dalit leader who had in the past strongly objected to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar‚Äôs decision to constitute a Mahadalit Commission, also said the sub-categorisation in the OBC quota does not mean that the same will happen in the case of Scheduled Castes too.

‚ÄúThere is no question of any categorisation in the Scheduled Castes quota. Results have not been good in states, including Bihar, where this (sub-categorisation among Dalits) has been done,‚Äù he said. Kushwaha said the decision to carve out a separate quota for extremely backward castes from the OBC quota is a crucial step in the direction of social justice. Kushwaha also welcomed the decision to increase the creamy layer for OBC reservation from the existing amount of Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh annually.

US may sanction Pakistan officials with ties to terrorists: White House,"‚ÄúThe US has been really patient with Pakistan for a really long time. We haven‚Äôt been getting a good deal from them,‚Äù a White House official said. (Source: File Photo) ‚ÄúThe US has been really patient with Pakistan for a really long time. We haven‚Äôt been getting a good deal from them,‚Äù a White House official said. (Source: File Photo)

President Donald Trump has put Pakistan on ‚Äúnotice‚Äù and his get-tough approach could include sanctioning Pakistani officials with ties to terrorist groups such as Haqqani Network, a top White House official has said. The official also said that with Pakistan the ‚Äúbusiness as usual, as it has been up to now is over.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe important takeaway for the Pakistani government is that, you know, they should understand that they‚Äôre on notice from this president, from this administration,‚Äù the official was quoted as saying by Politico yesterday.

‚ÄúThe US has been really patient with Pakistan for a really long time. We haven‚Äôt been getting a good deal from them,‚Äù he added. He said the US could conceivably impose sanctions on terrorist groups including the Haqqani network, which has links to elements in the Pakistani government, as well as on any Pakistani officials who are tied to these kinds of groups.

The Haqqani network, blamed for several deadly attacks against Indian interests in Afghanistan including the 2008 bombing of the Indian mission in Kabul that killed 58 people, has also carried out a number of kidnappings and attacks against US interests in Afghanistan.

The White House official said that the onus for improving the relationship is now on Pakistan. He said the president had benefited from an outsider‚Äôs perspective on the US-Pakistan relationship, eschewing the conventional wisdom that ‚Äúhowever much the Pakistanis double-deal you and lie to you and don‚Äôt cooperate, you have no choice but to just keep the status quo.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do we get the Pakistan to behave better? The answer is we have leverage points over Pakistan that the strategy contemplates we will use. Ultimately whether they behave better or not is completely up to them,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThey may calculate that it‚Äôs more important to remain allied with terrorists, it‚Äôs more important to give terrorists safe haven, it‚Äôs more important to do all the nasty things that they‚Äôve been doing that we don‚Äôt like than it is to have a good relationship with the US,‚Äù he continued.

‚ÄúIf so, that‚Äôs a choice that they will make and then we will make choices based on their choice,‚Äù he said.

Observing that the US gives the Pakistani government substantial security aid, the official said, and in return receive, at best, ‚Äúindifference to border crossing and terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries‚Äù in Pakistan‚Äôs tribal regions along the Afghan border.

‚ÄúIn the worst case,‚Äù he said, the Pakistani government has been guilty of ‚Äúactive direct support‚Äù for terrorist groups, the media outlet reported.

China backs Pakistan after Donald Trump‚Äôs warning on terror safe havens,"Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, while dismissing to Trump‚Äôs scathing criticism of Pakistan‚Äôs support to terror groups, said, ‚ÄúI think the international community should truly affirm‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs efforts in combating terrorism. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, while dismissing to Trump‚Äôs scathing criticism of Pakistan‚Äôs support to terror groups, said, ‚ÄúI think the international community should truly affirm‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs efforts in combating terrorism.

China on Tuesday jumped to the defence of its all-weather ally Pakistan in the wake of US President Donald Trump‚Äôs stern warning to it over providing safe havens to terrorists, saying that Islamabad is at the frontline of combating terrorism. Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to announce his Afghanistan and South Asia policy, hit out at Pakistan for providing safe havens to ‚Äúagents of chaos‚Äù that kill Americans in Afghanistan and warned Islamabad that it has ‚Äúmuch to lose‚Äù by harbouring terrorists.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, while reacting to Trump‚Äôs comments on Pakistan, said, ‚ÄúHope the relevant policy decision by US side will be conducive to promoting security, stability of the relevant region.‚Äù

‚Äú(On) President Trump‚Äôs remarks on Pakistan, I should say that Pakistan is at the frontline of fighting terrorism, has made sacrifices in fighting terrorism, making an important contribution to upholding peace and stability,‚Äù Hua said, strongly defending Beijing‚Äôs all-weather friend.

Trump, in his address, said a pillar of his new strategy was a change in America‚Äôs approach to Pakistan.

He slammed Pakistan for its support to terror groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so.

‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,‚Äù Trump said.

‚ÄúPakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists,‚Äù he said, in a warning to Pakistan.

Hua, in response to Trump‚Äôs scathing criticism of Pakistan‚Äôs support to terror groups, said, ‚ÄúI think the international community should truly affirm‚Äù the efforts by Pakistan in combating terrorism.

‚ÄúWe are pleased to see US and Pakistan to conduct cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts on the basis of mutual respect and contribute to the global peace and stability,‚Äù she said.

In his speech, Trump slammed Islamabad for harbouring militants who target US service members.

‚ÄúBut that will have to change. That will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country‚Äôs harbouring of militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace,‚Äù Trump said

Trump blames media for condemnation of comments on Virginia,"‚ÄúYou know where my heart is,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are.‚Äù said Trump at the Charlottesville protest. ‚ÄúYou know where my heart is,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are.‚Äù said Trump at the Charlottesville protest.

President Donald Trump blamed the media Tuesday for the widespread condemnation of his response to a Charlottesville, Virginia, protest organized by white supremacists that led to the killing of a counter-protester.

Trump opened his political rally in Phoenix with a call for unity, saying, ‚ÄúWhat happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America and tonight, this entire arena stands united in forceful condemnation of the thugs that perpetrated hatred and violence.‚Äù

But he quickly trained his ire on the media, shouting that he ‚Äúopenly called for healing unity and love‚Äù in the immediate aftermath of Charlottesville and claiming the media had misrepresented him. He read from his three responses to the violence _ getting more animated with each one.

Democrats and fellow Republicans had denounced Trump for placing blame for the Charlottesville violence on ‚Äúboth sides.‚Äù Trump omitted that part of his reaction from his recap Tuesday night.

‚ÄúYou know where my heart is,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are.‚Äù

After the rally, a day of noisy but largely peaceful protests outside the Phoenix convention center turned unruly as police fired pepper spray at crowds after someone apparently lobbed rocks and bottles at officers.

Trump spoke after Vice President Mike Pence and others called repeatedly for unity.

Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Dr. Alveda King, the niece of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., were among the openers. Franklin Graham, son of the evangelist Billy Graham, led the rally-goers in prayer, saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre divided racially, and we‚Äôre adrift morally.‚Äù

Trump teased a pardon for former sheriff Joe Arpaio, asking the crowd what they thought of him. Loud cheers erupted. The former Maricopa County sheriff is awaiting sentencing after his conviction in federal court for disobeying court orders to stop his immigration patrols.

‚ÄúSo was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?‚Äù Trump asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make a prediction: I think he‚Äôs going to be just fine.‚Äù

Earlier, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump wouldn‚Äôt discuss or take action on a pardon ‚Äúat any point today,‚Äù even though the president had told Fox News he was considering it.

Trump said at the rally that the only reason he wouldn‚Äôt pardon Arpaio from the stage was to avoid controversy for the moment.

In the comfort of his most fervent fans, Trump often resurrects his free-wheeling 2016 campaign style, pinging insults at perceived enemies such as the media and meandering from topic to topic without a clear theme. Although Trump‚Äôs high-profile warm-up acts suggested the president‚Äôs speech would be about unity, the president was more intent on settling scores. And the tone of the event took on a combative tone.

At one point, the president threatened to shut down the federal government unless Congress, mired in gridlock over spending bills, agrees to provide funding for the border wall he wants to have built between the United States and Mexico.

Trump told the crowd, he said he has a message for ‚Äúobstructionist‚Äù Democrats. ‚ÄúIf we have to close down our government, we‚Äôre building that wall.‚Äù

He skewered both of Arizona‚Äôs Republican senators _ but coyly refused to mention their names, describing his own restraint as ‚Äúvery presidential.‚Äù

Instead, Trump bemoaned that the Senate was only ‚Äúone vote away‚Äù from passing a health care overhaul. Sen. John McCain, who is undergoing treatment for an aggressive form of brain cancer, voted against a Republican health care bill.

Trump called another unnamed senator ‚Äúweak on borders, weak on crime.‚Äù Trump has lashed out at Sen. Jeff Flake, a frequent critic, using the same language in the past.

The president tweeted last week: ‚ÄúGreat to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He‚Äôs toxic!‚Äù Flake has been on tour promoting his book that says the Republican Party‚Äôs embrace of Trump has left conservatism withering.

Ward attended Trump‚Äôs rally, but did not appear onstage.

In a modest but telling swipe at Ward _ and, by extension, at Trump _ the Senate Leadership Fund, a political committee closely aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is spending $10,000 on digital ads that say of her, ‚ÄúNot conservative, just crazy ideas.‚Äù

Trump began his Arizona visit with a brief trip to the southern edge of the country.

While touring a Marine Corps base in Yuma that is a hub of operations for the U.S. Border Patrol, Trump inspected a drone and other border equipment on display in a hangar.

Trump shook his head as he was shown a series of everyday objects, such as a fire extinguisher, that had been refashioned to secretly transport drugs across the border. Afterward, he spent about 20 minutes greeting service members in the grueling, 106-degree heat, signing caps with his ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù campaign slogan and posing for selfies on the tarmac just steps from Air Force One.

Rs 200 note could be in circulation by September,"The new Rs 200 note that will hit banks and ATMs soon The new Rs 200 note that will hit banks and ATMs soon

The finance ministry on Wednesday notified the introduction of the new Rs 200 currency notes for the first time, paving the way for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to soon launch the notes to improve the circulation of lower-denomination currency notes. The new Rs 200 notes could be in circulation as early as September, said an official source.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley, however, made it clear that the government was not considering banning Rs 2,000 notes. Recently the central bank introduced a new series of Rs 50 currency notes. These new fluorescent blue notes in the Mahatma Gandhi series looked slightly smaller and slimmer than the existing Rs 50 notes.

However, the government is unlikely to relaunch the Rs 1,000 bank notes, according to the source. The government had demonetised the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November last year, replacing around 86 per cent of the total value of currency in circulation. While the new Rs 2,000 notes were launched to remonetise fast, there was a shortage of lower-denomination notes.

In a gazette notification on Wednesday, the department of economic affairs said: ‚ÄúIn exercise of powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 24 of the RBI Act, 1934 and on the recommendation of the central board of directors of the RBI, the central government hereby specifies the denomination of bank notes of the value of Rs 200.‚Äù

Understanding context of SC ruling on triple talaq: Divorce rate of Muslim women is thrice that of men,"Women look out to the Haji Ali dargah in the sea off Mumbai on Tuesday, the day the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq. (Source: Express Photo/Nirmal Harindran) Women look out to the Haji Ali dargah in the sea off Mumbai on Tuesday, the day the Supreme Court struck down instant triple talaq. (Source: Express Photo/Nirmal Harindran)

Now that a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court has struck down instant triple talaq in a complex, layered, split verdict, here are some figures that describe the social context to which the judgment speaks. Data from the Census of India, 2011, showed that while among all religious communities, the rate of divorce was significantly lower among men than among women, the disparity was particularly stark among Muslims. So while the ‚Äúrefined divorce rate‚Äù, or rate of divorce per 1,000 marriages, was 1.59 among Muslim men, among Muslim women, it was more than three and a half times higher ‚Äî 5.63.

Buddhists came next on the disparity scale, the corresponding numbers being 3 and 6.73, followed by Christians (2.92 per 1,000 marriages for men and 5.67 for women). Overall, Census 2011 recorded the number of divorces per 1,000 marriages in India as 1.58 for men, and for women, double that at 3.10. (See chart) The lower refined divorce rate among men across the board suggests that men tend to re-marry at a far quicker rate than women ‚Äî in other words, they stay divorced for a far shorter time.

While Tuesday‚Äôs Supreme Court verdict striking down talaq-e-biddat or instant triple talaq has been rightly hailed as a victory for gender justice, it is important to keep in mind that there are no concrete data on the prevalence of this form of divorce ‚Äî the impact of the judgment is, therefore, difficult to measure. Muslim couples can divorce in other ways too, including through the intervention of religious institutions such as the Qazi and Dar-ul-Qaza.

In May ‚Äî a day before the Supreme Court began hearing the legal challenge to instant triple talaq, the Delhi-based Centre for Research and Debates in Development Policy (CRDDP) reported the results of its survey that showed that the incidence of this form of talaq was less than even 1 in 100. In this survey led by Dr Abu Saleh Shariff, best known as Member Secretary of the Sachar Committee whose 2006 report remains the definitive assessment of the social, educational and economic backwardness and deprivation status of Muslims, CRDDP surveyed 20,671 verified respondents ‚Äî 16,860 men and 3,811 women ‚Äî across India between March and May, 2017.

The survey recorded 331 talaqs reported by both women and men respondents, of which just 1 was ‚Äúoral triple talaq‚Äù, where ‚Äútalaq‚Äù was uttered three times in one go, without any witnesses or record. A survey conducted by the Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court case, however, reported a dramatically higher incidence of unilateral instant triple talaq. Of 4,710 Muslim women from economically poor strata surveyed by BMMA, 525 ‚Äî 11.14% ‚Äî said they were divorced. And of this group of 525 divorcees, as many as 408 women ‚Äî 77.71% ‚Äî said they had been given instant triple talaq.

The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, one of the respondents in the triple talaq case, says the rate of divorce among Muslims is lower than that of other communities. The AIMPLB has analysed data from family courts and various Dar-ul-Qazas across eight districts of Kerala, Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to show that the number of divorces among Muslims (1,307) were a small fraction of the number for Hindus (16,505).

By themselves, Muslim women do not appear the most vulnerable to being divorced in the Census data. The refined divorce rates for Buddhist and Christian women were higher than that for Muslim women (6.73 and 5.67 respectively, compared with 5.63 for Muslims). The refined divorce rate for Hindu women was much lower at 2.60, higher than only Sikh women (2.56 per 1,000 marriages).

Among Muslim women, the largest percentage of divorces take place in the age group 20-34 (43.9%), in which only 24% of the total Muslim female population lies. What is important to note, again, is that 3.9% of Muslim women divorcees are of age 19 and below, the most among all communities in this age group. As per Census 2011, the total number of divorcees in India was only 13.2 lakh ‚Äî a severely underreported figure, according to activists. There were 9.09 lakh women divorcees (68% of the total divorcee population) and 4.52 lakh divorced men.

Cases of divorce are settled under a range of laws such as The Divorce Act, 1869 (4 of 1869), The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936 (3 of 1936), The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 (8 of 1939), The Special Marriage Act, 1954 (43 of 1954), and The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.

Taliban warns Afghanistan will become ‚Äògraveyard‚Äô for US,"‚ÄúAs long as there is one US soldier in our land, and they continue to impose war on us, we, with a high morale will continue our jihad,‚Äù a Taliban spokesman said. (File Photo/Representational) ‚ÄúAs long as there is one US soldier in our land, and they continue to impose war on us, we, with a high morale will continue our jihad,‚Äù a Taliban spokesman said. (File Photo/Representational)

The Taliban warned that Afghanistan would become ‚Äúa graveyard‚Äù for the United States today after President Donald Trump cleared the way for thousands more American troops to be sent to the war-torn country.

‚ÄúIf America doesn‚Äôt withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, soon Afghanistan will become another graveyard for this superpower in the 21st century,‚Äù Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan, said in a statement. He added that America should think of an exit strategy ‚Äúinstead of continuing the war‚Äù. ‚ÄúAs long as there is one US soldier in our land, and they continue to impose war on us, we, with a high morale will continue our jihad,‚Äù Mujahid said.

Trump backtracked from his promise to rapidly end America‚Äôs longest war in his first formal address to the nation as commander-in-chief late Monday, though he did not offer specifics. He said he had concluded ‚Äúthe consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable‚Äù, leaving a vacuum that terrorists ‚Äúwould instantly fill‚Äù.

While Trump refused to offer detailed troop numbers, senior White House officials said he had already authorised his defence secretary to deploy up to 3,900 more troops to Afghanistan. Earlier Mujahid had dismissed the strategy as vague and ‚Äúnothing new‚Äù. ‚ÄúFor now I can tell you there was nothing new in his speech and it was very unclear,‚Äù he told AFP.

A senior Taliban commander told AFP that Trump was just perpetuating the ‚Äúarrogant behaviour‚Äù of previous presidents such as George W Bush. ‚ÄúHe is just wasting American soldiers. We know how to defend our country. It will not change anything. For generations we have fought this war, we are not scared, we are fresh and we will continue this war until our last breath,‚Äù he told AFP by telephone from an undisclosed location. He added that the statement proved the current Afghan government ‚Äúis a US puppet‚Äù.

The insurgents signalled their intentions minutes after Trump spoke by claiming the US embassy in Kabul had been the target of a rocket attack late Monday. The rocket landed in a field in the city‚Äôs diplomatic quarter, with no casualties reported.

Trump also lambasted US ally Pakistan for offering safe haven to ‚Äúagents of chaos‚Äù. A commander from the Taliban-allied Haqqani network, long believed to have links to Pakistan‚Äôs shadowy military establishment, told AFP that Trump ‚Äúhas proved it‚Äôs a Crusade‚Äù. ‚ÄúHis statement has proved that he wants to eliminate the entire Muslim umma (community),‚Äù he said.

Prior to Trump‚Äôs announcement the Taliban had written an open letter warning him not to send more troops and calling for the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.

Former boss of Dinamo Zagreb shot and wounded,"Zdravko Mamic is now an advisor at Dinamo Zagreb. (Source: Reuters File) Zdravko Mamic is now an advisor at Dinamo Zagreb. (Source: Reuters File)

Zdravko Mamic, the former boss of Croatian football club Dinamo Zagreb and one of country‚Äôs richest men, was shot and wounded in the leg by two attackers in western Bosnia on Tuesday, local media reported. Dinamo Zagreb, where Mamic is now an advisor, called the incident ‚Äúattempted murder‚Äù.

Web portal 24sata said Mamic, 58, was visiting his father‚Äôs grave near the Bosnian town of Tomislavgrad when two masked gunmen fired shots at him. He was transferred to a nearby hospital where he was treated for injuries to his leg, local media quoted a police spokesman as saying. Reuters could not immediately reach the police or representatives of Mamic for comment.

Mamic, a powerful figure in Croatian football who is currently on trial for tax evasion, has been the target of other physical attacks in the past few years, which soccer officials blamed on rival teams‚Äô fans, but this was the first time he has been shot and the motive was unclear.

Dinamo Zagreb, Croatia‚Äôs biggest football club, said in a statement after Tuesday‚Äôs attack that it was ‚Äúhorrified by the armed attack and the attempted murder of the club‚Äôs adviser‚Äù.

Mamic and two other former senior officials from Dinamo Zagreb are on trial after being charged with avoiding paying 12.2 million Croatian kuna ($1.94 million) in taxes and diverting 116 million kuna from the soccer club. All three deny the charges.

Dismissing the charges, AAP, in its complaint, said ‚Äúneither it nor any of its leaders/office-bearers have printed or asked for the distribution of the said poster (sic)‚Äù.

As Bawana went to polls on Wednesday, a war of words erupted between the AAP and the BJP over an ‚Äúobjectionable and communal‚Äù poster purportedly bearing a message from Delhi Minorities minister Imran Hussain. Police filed an FIR against unknown persons, following a complaint by the State Election Commission.

While Hussain claimed it was fake and filed a complaint, the BJP too filed a complaint alleging that the AAP was attempting to polarise votes, and sought action against Hussain. The FIR was filed at Bawana police station under sections 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot) and 505(2) (promoting enmity) of the IPC and under the Representation of People Act. DCP (Rohini) Rishi Pal said, ‚ÄúTwo separate cases were registered on Tuesday at Bawana police station after we received complaints from the returning officer, Delhi EC. Further investigation is on.‚Äù

In his complaint, returning officer Vivek Agarwal, said, ‚ÄúThe pamphlet allegedly issued by Imran Hussain, Minister, Govt of Delhi‚Ä¶ prima facie makes an appeal to resident Muslims of Bawana to vote for quom (community). In addition to this, other objectionable and communal appeal has been made.‚Äù

Although the FIR was lodged against unknown persons, Leader of Opposition and senior BJP leader Vijender Gupta claimed, ‚ÄúPolice have lodged a case against Hussain. AAP made a clear attempt to communalise the polls and spread hatred in the area on the day of polling.‚Äù

Dismissing the charges, AAP, in its complaint, said ‚Äúneither it nor any of its leaders/office-bearers have printed or asked for the distribution of the said poster (sic)‚Äù. AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said, ‚ÄúThis is a clear attempt to malign the party.‚Äù

MS Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar Kumar came to the rescue of the Indian side against Sri Lanka in the second ODI of the five-match series when the two compiled an unbeaten partnership of 100 runs, helping India win the match by 3 wickets in Kandy. Kumar went on to score a half-century while Dhoni remained not out on 45.

India were handed a target of 231 runs in 47 overs after rain delayed the start of their innings. Openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma provided the visitors with perfect start as they scored 109 runs for the first wicket before Sharma was sent back by Akila Dananjaya for 54.

Dhawan was soon sent back in the hut after he tried to sweep a delivery from Siriwardana over fine leg but failed to clear the 30-yard circle. Mathews who was standing at short-fine leg region ran to his left and grabbed a magnificent diving catch to dismiss the Indian batsman for 49.

The visiting team looked in control but the 18th over of the innings from Dananjaya turned the course of the match on its head. The leggie scalped a total of three wickets inn that over that included the dismissals of Kedar Jadhav, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul.

Danajaya cleaned up Kedar Jadhav for 1 on the very first delivery of the over. Indian captain Kohli experimented with his playing position and came in at number 5. But he had a disappointing and a brief stay at the crease. He scored a boundary of the first ball that he played and was dismissed on the next one after failing to read a wrong-un.

The third wicket of the over came in the form of Rahul who was bowled by the leg-spinner while trying to go for a defence. He later removed Axar Patel for 6 by trapping his in front of the stumps.

The leggie‚Äôs sixth wicket came when Hardik Pandya came down the track but missed the delivery and was stumped by Niroshan Dickwella without opening the scoring. India were soon left tottering at 131/7 but an unbeaten stand between Dhoni and Kumar sealed victory in the second match of the series.

St Kitts and Nevis hold Mauritius to 1-1 draw in tri-nation football tournament,"St Kitts and Nevis had to wait for 68 minutes for the equaliser. (Source: PTI) St Kitts and Nevis had to wait for 68 minutes for the equaliser. (Source: PTI)

St Kitts and Nevis found a late equaliser as their match against Mauritius ended in a 1-1 draw in the tri-nation football tournament in Mumbai on Tuesday. Rogers Kimaree struck in the 87th minute after Jean Frederic Sarah had put Mauritius ahead in the 19th minute off a header.

Mauritius looked organised, adopted an aggressive approach from the start and had better possession of the ball.

It helped them take a 1-0 lead in the 19th minute. From a cross from the flank by defender Pascal Damien Balisson, Sarah gave Mauritius the lead off a header.

St Kitts and Nevis had to wait for 68 minutes for the equaliser. Assisted by forward Tishan Hanley, Kimaree ran in and netted the ball even as a handful of fans cheered at the Andheri Sports Complex.

Going into the game, Mauritian coach Francisco Filo left out goalkeeper Kevin Obrian Jean-Louis and replaced him with James Caserne.

After the break, Mauritius missed a chance to extend their lead as Jean Mervyn Jocelyn‚Äôs shot was on target only to be saved by St Kitts and Nevis custodian with a dive.

A few minutes after that, Sarah‚Äôs header went completely off target, even as the St Kitts and Nevis defence was tested all through the game.

Mauritius again had a chance but Louis Guiyano Chiffone, who got a pass from Sarah, hit marginally wide. Sarah, who was the best Mauritian player, had another chance but this time, he too missed the target.

The other notable chance for St Kitts and Nevis came when Kimaree shot at the goal after a through ball which was saved by the goalkeeper.

St Kitts and Nevis coach Jacques Passy said that his team played a ‚Äúvery bad first half‚Äù.

‚ÄúI would not call an excellent, but an above average performance. We had six goal opportunities, (but) a draw leaves me with a smile,‚Äù said Passy.

His boys play India on August 24 and Passy termed the hosts as favourites.

‚ÄúI have no excuse philosophy, If we win, we are the champions. If India win, they are champions. I am facing a great team (India), which everyone should be proud of. We can do much better. ‚ÄúThe absolute favourite to win the tournament is India. It is no more a three nation, but a two-nation tournament. Our focus is on India,‚Äù the coach said.

‚ÄúToday, our display was below than what the team can do, it was not a tactical problem. We were not just comfortable. India are the favourites,‚Äù he maintained.

Mauritian coach Filo said his side will hope to improve. St Kitts and Nevis play hosts India on August 24 at the same venue.

Pakistan media watchdog ordered to stop airing Sharif‚Äôs ‚Äòanti-judiciary‚Äô speeches,"‚ÄúPakistan is being embarrassed in the world because of this decision. People across the world and Pakistanis are rejecting the decision.‚Äù said Nawaz Sharif (File) ‚ÄúPakistan is being embarrassed in the world because of this decision. People across the world and Pakistanis are rejecting the decision.‚Äù said Nawaz Sharif (File)

Pakistan‚Äôs electronic media watchdog was today ordered by the High Court here to stop airing ‚Äòanti-judiciary‚Äô speeches by ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif after his disqualification as the premier. On July 28, the five-member bench of the Supreme Court had disqualified Sharif for possessing a work permit in the firm of his son in the UAE.

After his disqualification, Sharif held a roadshow from Islamabad to his hometown of Lahore during which he had made a number of speeches in different cities. The contents of his speeches was seen in some quarters as being critical of the apex court.

Lahore High Court (LHC) Justice Mamnoon Rasheed Sheikh, hearing a contempt of court petition filed by Amaan Welfare Foundation President Amina Malik, today issued notices to Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) Chairman Absar Alam asking him to file a report by September 12 ‚Äì the date of the next hearing of the case, Dawn newspaper reported.

The petition was filed by Malik earlier this month against the former premier and 13 federal and provincial ministers of the ruling PML-N for their outburst against the Supreme Court following Nawaz‚Äôs disqualification in the Panama Papers graft case. The petitioner had asked the court to direct PEMRA to stop ‚Äúairing and telecasting the contemptuous, derogatory and defamatory speeches‚Äù allegedly made by Nawaz and PML-N ministers. During the hearing, Malik‚Äôs counsel Advocate Azhar Siddique argued that members of the parliament had made statements against the judiciary following the Panama Papers scandal verdict.

However, the government‚Äôs lawyer argued that the petition was based on allegations and, therefore, could not be heard by the High Court. After hearing the petitioner‚Äôs arguments in chambers, the judges ordered a temporary ban on the airing of the alleged ‚Äúanti-judiciary statements‚Äù made by Nawaz Sharif, his brother Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif, Minister for Railways Saad Rafique and 16 other members of parliament till it deliberates the maintainability of a case regarding the same.

"US lawmakers welcome sanctions on Chinese, Russian companies","US lawmakers have welcomed the Trump administration‚Äôs decision slapping sanctions on Russian and Chinese entities and individuals for helping North Korea advance its missile and nuclear weapons programme. (Representational Image) US lawmakers have welcomed the Trump administration‚Äôs decision slapping sanctions on Russian and Chinese entities and individuals for helping North Korea advance its missile and nuclear weapons programme. (Representational Image)

Top US lawmakers have welcomed the Trump administration‚Äôs decision slapping sanctions on Russian and Chinese entities and individuals for helping North Korea advance its missile and nuclear weapons programme. The yesterday‚Äôs sanctions targeted 10 Russian and Chinese companies and six individuals involved in conducting business with the reclusive nation. ‚ÄúI support strong sanctions against those enabling North Korea to advance its missile program, and I am pleased by the US Treasury‚Äôs action today,‚Äù Senator Joe Donnelly, Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance, said.

‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said, North Korea should be our top national security priority in the Pacific and we must focus the full economic and diplomatic force of our nation on this problem and get other countries in the region to do the same,‚Äù said Donnelly, who recently helped the Senate pass bipartisan legislation, which Trump signed into law, that would increase sanctions on North Korea.

As a Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, he has led efforts to increase funding for US missile defence programmes and supported provisions in this year‚Äôs national defence bill to significantly strengthen the US homeland missile defence system against the threat of an intercontinental ballistic missile attack. ‚ÄúFor far too long, China has enabled North Korea to pursue nuclear development, cyber warfare, global provocation, and egregious human rights violations. Russia has also not been a good faith partner on these issues. The status quo is no longer acceptable,‚Äù said Congressman Robert Pittenger.

‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs decisive action, coupled with my legislation to further punish businesses which support North Korean cyberattacks, sends a strong message. If you support the brutal North Korean regime, there will be a punitive response from the United States,‚Äù he said.

Congressman Dan Donovan said the Trump administration‚Äôs strategic sanctions against companies and individuals that do business with North Korea are exactly what‚Äôs needed right now. ‚ÄúWe must continue to isolate the regime, cut off its economic activity and pressure nations, particularly China and Russia, whose companies and citizens help the North generate the resources used to further its aggressive nuclear programme,‚Äù said Congressman Dan Donovan who serves on the House Committee on Homeland Security and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Yesterday‚Äôs sanctions target third-country companies and individuals that assist already-designated persons who support North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, deal in the North Korean energy trade, facilitate its exportation of workers, and enable sanctioned North Korean entities to access US and international financial systems.

Some of the prominent companies and individuals slapped with sanctions are China-based Dandong Rich Earth Trading Co; Mosco-based Gefest-M LLC and its director, Russian national Ruben Kirakosyan; and China- and Hong Kong-based Mingzheng International Trading Limited.

As a result, any property or interests in property of the designated persons in the possession or control of US persons or within the United States must be blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them, the Treasury Department said in a statement. The Treasury also designated three Chinese coal companies collectively responsible for importing nearly half a billion dollars‚Äô worth of North Korean coal between 2013 and 2016.

"Protesters gather at Donald Trump‚Äôs Phoenix rally, senators will not attend","Pro Trump supporters face off with peace activists during protests outside a Donald Trump campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. (Source: Reuters) Pro Trump supporters face off with peace activists during protests outside a Donald Trump campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. (Source: Reuters)

Hundreds of supporters and opponents of U.S. President Donald Trump gathered in Phoenix on Tuesday for his first political rally since he caused an uproar last week with remarks about white nationalists and neo-Nazis in Virginia. Arizona‚Äôs two U.S. senators, who have both clashed with Trump, a fellow Republican, were expected to skip the event. Protesters yelled: ‚ÄúShame, shame, shame‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA‚Äù as the Trump supporters began filing into the Phoenix Convention Center ahead of the rally.

Supporters, who lined up for hours in the Arizona heat ahead of the event, chanted: ‚ÄúBuild the wall,‚Äù a reference to Trump‚Äôs pledge to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Many wore red hats with Trump‚Äôs campaign slogan, ‚ÄúMake America Great Again.‚Äù Trump has held a series of 2020 re-election campaign stops despite only having taken office in January. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, had asked him to postpone Tuesday‚Äôs event, scheduled for 7 p.m. MST (0200 GMT on Wednesday), while the nation healed from outrage and division after a deadly rally this month in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Trump drew broad criticism for blaming both white nationalists and counter-protesters for the deadly violence at that rally, which was organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. One woman was killed. Neither John McCain nor Jeff Flake, Arizona‚Äôs senators, was expected to attend the Phoenix event, said a source familiar with Flake‚Äôs re-election campaign and published reports, underscoring Trump‚Äôs fractious relationship with some in his own party. Republican Governor Doug Ducey told the Arizona Republic on Monday that he would welcome Trump on the tarmac when he arrived but would not attend the rally. Despite speculation to the contrary, Trump was not expected to use the event to pardon Joe Arpaio, a former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, and an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration.

Arpaio, 85, was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case. He lost a re-election bid last year in the county. But White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters traveling with Trump on Air Force One: ‚ÄúThere will be no discussion of that today at any point and no action will be taken on that front at any point today.‚Äù Before flying to Phoenix, the state capital, Trump landed in Yuma, Arizona, near the Mexican border, for a tour of border security facilities. He is seeking congressional funding for the wall he wants built along the border to deter illegal immigration.

HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE

A heavy police presence deployed around the Phoenix venue. Some White House officials privately expressed concern on Monday about Trump‚Äôs Phoenix rally, fearing he might revisit the Charlottesville issue in the heat of the moment while cheered on by supporters. ‚ÄúThe president is always welcome in Arizona,‚Äù Flake spokesman Will Allison said in an emailed statement. Flake ‚Äúhopes the president will speak constructively about moving forward with tax reform, border security, and other important issues facing our country,‚Äù Allison said.

Earlier this summer, Flake published a book questioning the direction of the Republican Party in the Trump era, making him one of the few party members willing to criticize the president. Last week, Trump sent a tweet voicing support for Flake‚Äôs challenger, Kelli Ward, in next year‚Äôs Arizona Senate Republican primary. In the tweet, Trump called Flake ‚Äútoxic‚Äù and ‚Äúweak.‚Äù Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who was a senior aide to former Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, said: ‚ÄúSenator Flake is a popular and principled conservative voice in the United States Senate. Attacking him is stupid and counterproductive.

‚ÄúInstead, the president should be focused on expanding the Republican majority by targeting obstructionist Senate Democrats, especially the ones in states he won last year.‚Äù The president has also made caustic remarks about McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee and war hero, who is battling cancer. A spokesman for McCain could not immediately be reached. The Phoenix event will be Trump‚Äôs first trip as president to Arizona, which he won in the 2016 election.

Rajasthan to brew a different cup of tea from olive leaves,"Several lab tests were conducted to confirm the beneficial properties of olive leaves before producing the product. (Source: File Photo) Several lab tests were conducted to confirm the beneficial properties of olive leaves before producing the product. (Source: File Photo)

The desert state of Rajasthan will soon give the country an alternative to green tea ‚Äî brewed from olive leaves. State Agriculture Minister Prabhu Lal Saini said the brand ‚Äî named Olitia, The Olive Tea ‚Äî will be launched ‚Äúvery soon‚Äù by Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje. ‚ÄúThe process has been completed and we will launch it as soon as we get time from the chief minister.

It will be the first time in the country and the world that a green tea alternative will be produced out of olive leaves,‚Äù he told PTI on the sidelines of an event in the city.

Rajasthan started cultivating olives in 2007 in collaboration with Israel and now the state cultivates them on 5,000 hectares, the minister said. ‚ÄúAnd we have made a lot of progress since then. An olive refinery is operational in the state at Bikaner, also the country‚Äôs first.

We have also began production of olive honey,‚Äù he said. Asked how the state got the idea of producing ‚ÄúOlive green tea‚Äù, Saini said, ‚ÄúI am a PhD in Agriculture myself, and I knew olive leaves have several health benefits. So I decided to get some study and lab testing done about it.‚Äù He showed several papers with findings of the lab studies. A lab test, conducted in July, confirmed the presence of several anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory and other such substances in the olive leaves. One of the substances found was Luteolin.

‚ÄúExperiments with Luteolin show that it suppresses bacteria-induced inflammation. Luteolin is an oxygen scavenger,‚Äù reads the report. He said the lab tests confirmed the presence of ‚Äúsuch strong anti-oxidant‚Äù in olive leaves that they can help prevent several types of cancer ‚Äî blood cancer, prostate cancer and ovaries cancer. After the studies and lab tests confirmed these properties of the olive leaves, the decision to process them was taken, he said.

‚ÄúIt will medically benefit those who suffer from mental stress, cardiac disease. It has anti-inflammatory properties as well,‚Äù he said. The Olitia, The Olive Tea, packet also claims it has zero caffeine, builds immunity, fights fatigue and has anti-ageing properties. Saini said the ‚Äúolive green tea‚Äù will come in multiple flavours which are in vogue these days like exotic, lemon and mint.

‚ÄúWe are trying to diversify and produces other flavours like ginger, Tulsi etc,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have received proposals from various countries including the UK, the USA and from the Gulf, that they want to sign MoUs in this regard,‚Äù he said. The agriculture minister said that 66 per cent of ‚Äúour state has arid or semi-arid climatic conditions. But we are among the leaders in the country as far as agricultural innovation is concerned thanks to the chief minister,scientists, officials and the people‚Äù.

The song that‚Äôs India: Revisiting Desh Raag,"(From left) Pt Ravi Shankar on the sitar, tabla maestro Zakir Hussain. (From left) Pt Ravi Shankar on the sitar, tabla maestro Zakir Hussain.

On the morning of August 15, 1989, India woke up to Desh raag, a celebration of the nation through classical music and dance. India, with its newly acquired colour television sets, watched as Pandit Bhimsen Joshi invoked Desh, a soothing late evening raga associated with the monsoons and the Indian national song ‚Äî Bankim Chandra Chatterjee‚Äôs Vande Mataram.

Set against a waterfall and majestic mountains, we saw a solemn looking Joshi sing Lab pe jaage geet aisa, Goonje bankar des raag in his sonorous voice to the sounds of a tabla and tanpura. His verses were followed by the doleful strains of a sarangi played by Pt Ram Narayan. There was also sitar maestro Pt Ravi Shankar strumming the seven sitar strings with exuberance, Pt Hari Prasad Chaurasia breathing life into a reed, Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma playing the santoor, M Balamuralikrishna playing the violin and singing Baje sargam in Tamil, and, the famed tabla dual between Ustad Allah Rakha and Zakir Hussain, with the tricolour as the background ‚Äî all inseparable elements of Desh raag.

The orchestral masterpiece also showcased various classical dance forms through short pieces: Kathak exponent Shovana Narayan danced at Fatehpur Sikri followed by Protima Bedi presenting Odissi on Juhu beach, Mallika Sarabhai giving a glimpse of Bharatanatyam, Kanak Rele presenting Mohiniattam and Swapna Sundari dancing the Kuchipudi.

This was India through sound and video, a glimpse into its rich and diverse cultural fabric. ‚ÄúIt was also education. Telling the people about one of India‚Äôs most significant pillars ‚Äî the classical arts,‚Äù says Narayan.

Odissi dancer Protima Bedi (L) and Kathak exponent Shovana Narayan. Odissi dancer Protima Bedi (L) and Kathak exponent Shovana Narayan.

Conceptualised by Suresh Mullick, creative director of Ogilvy back then, and directed by Kailash Surendranath for Lok Sewa Sanchar Parishad, the piece was commissioned by the Rajiv Gandhi government ‚Äúto raise the morale of people in a pre-liberalised India‚Äù. It was the third and final piece in a trilogy of short films; the other two being Freedom Run ‚Äî The Torch Song and Mile sur mera tumhara. ‚ÄúMost of the credit goes to the fine performances of these classical heavyweights and Suresh Mullick who thought of the idea. It came when the economy was underdeveloped, the country was facing unrest and the people needed a unity in diversity message,‚Äù says Surendranath about the piece, which was composed mainly by Joshi. It was later put together by prominent jazz musician, Louis Banks. Mullick also got composer P Vaidyanathan and cinematographer RK Rao on board.

For lyrics, Mullick went to one of his own ‚Äî Piyush Pande. ‚ÄúBaje sargam har taraf se, goonje bankar desh raag, said everything it had to. Suresh was my boss, and very particular. He said we should use analogies, and that people are smart enough to understand that we are talking of integration,‚Äù says Pande, now CEO, Ogilvy & Mather.

Surendranath, however, claims that Pandit Vinod Sharma (remembered for writing the popular Nirma advertisement) wrote the famed lines and that Pande didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúPandit Sharma was a dear associate and friend but he had nothing to do with the lyrics of the trilogy. Suresh is dead now and people want to create some or the other controversy over the piece, but all his old interviews, in great detail, talk about the process of writing both Mile sur and Desh raag and how he had commissioned them to me,‚Äù says Pande.

The process of completing the short film took over a month. Long fax messages were constantly exchanged between Banks and Mullick. Cinematographer Rao travelled across the country to shoot the film. ‚ÄúIt was the simplicity that worked,‚Äù says Rao about the video that quite possibly helped many to grasp that Kathakali and Manipuri were classical art forms and not folk dances.

While Mile sur was about seven minutes long, Desh raag exceeded 13 minutes. Brilliant and technically sound as the piece was, Desh raag found more acceptance in the art circles as compared to the masses. ‚ÄúThere hasn‚Äôt been a better musical genius than Suresh. But in hindsight, I think he went a little overboard. When the artiste in you gets too involved, that can happen. His artistic leanings resulted in the length becoming a problem. We loved those pieces by the artistes so much that we got carried away and got lost in its brilliance. It‚Äôs so beautiful and became extremely popular but not as much as Mile sur,‚Äù says Pande about the piece for which no artiste charged any fee.

The final lines of the national anthem were included towards the end of the film and that proved to be an impediment. ‚ÄúThe authorities did not like our inclusion of the last bit of the national anthem ‚Äî an incomplete anthem was considered inappropriate. But we managed to show it to Rajivji who loved it. He did not want anything changed,‚Äù says Surendranath.

"I will be available for selection in all three formats during the coming season, says AB de Villiers","AB de Villiers hasn‚Äôt played a Test since January last year. (Source: Reuters) AB de Villiers hasn‚Äôt played a Test since January last year. (Source: Reuters)

After deciding to step down from the ODI captaincy, AB de Villiers has confirmed that he will be playing the longer format of the game, which effectively means he will feature in all the three formats. While de Villiers hasn‚Äôt played a Test since the beginning of the year, he will return for the series against India towards the end of this year.

In a video on his official app, he said, ‚ÄúFollowing this recent break, I really do feel refreshed and revived. I want to get back on the field and I have today assured the national selectors that I will be available for selection in all three formats of the game during the coming season. There is plenty of hard work ahead in the nets and I must prepare properly, but I will be ready to play, if required, from the middle of October onwards.‚Äù

Lauding current skipper Faf du Plessis, he said, ‚ÄúFaf du Plessis has proved to be an outstanding captain of the T20 and Test teams, and bearing this in mind, I have informed Cricket South Africa that I would like to step down as captain of the ODI team. It has been an honour to lead the team for the past six years, but it is now time for someone else to take the ODI side forward. Whoever is chosen as the new ODI captain will have my complete support.‚Äù

‚ÄúA lot has been said and written over the past 12 months, and I feel it is time to make my position absolutely clear,‚Äù de Villiers said and added, ‚ÄúOver the past year or so, I have tried to manage many commitments. I have felt mentally and physically tired; my wife and I are bringing up two fantastic kids and playing in all three formats ever since 2004 has taken its toll.

Expressing gratitude for being able to represent the Proteas side, he said, ‚ÄúTogether with Cricket South Africa, we have tried to develop a viable schedule which allows me to prolong my career for as long as possible. ‚ÄúThis strategy has prompted some people to say I am picking and choosing when to play for the Proteas, and even to suggest I am somehow putting myself before the team. ‚ÄúThat is simply not true. That has never been true. Playing for South Africa is, and will always be, the greatest privilege of my life.‚Äù

"Clinton, in book, says Trump‚Äôs debate stalking made her skin crawl","FILE PHOTO: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump after the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Oct. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/John Locher) FILE PHOTO: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump after the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Oct. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/John Locher)

Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says in her new book that Donald Trump made her skin crawl by stalking her around the stage in a campaign debate and she wonders if she should have told him to ‚Äúback up, you creep.‚Äù In audio excerpts of the book ‚ÄúWhat Happened‚Äù aired on Wednesday on MSNBC, Clinton described her 2016 campaign as ‚Äújoyful, humbling, infuriating and just plain baffling‚Äù and acknowledged she failed her millions of supporters by losing to Trump in the November election.

In the excerpts, Clinton described the Oct. 9 debate in St. Louis in which Trump followed her closely about the stage, lurking behind her as she fielded questions from a live television audience. The debate came two days after an audiotape emerged in which Trump was heard bragging about groping women. ‚ÄúThis is not OK, I thought,‚Äù Clinton says. ‚ÄúIt was the second presidential debate and Donald Trump was looming behind me.

‚ÄúWe were on a small stage and no matter where I walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces. It was incredibly uncomfortable. He was literally breathing down my neck. My skin crawled,‚Äù Clinton said. ‚ÄúIt was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching: ‚ÄòWell, what would you do?‚Äô Do you stay calm, keep smiling and carry on as if he weren‚Äôt repeatedly invading your space? Or do you turn, look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly: ‚ÄòBack up, you creep. Get away from me. I know you love to intimidate women but you can‚Äôt intimidate me.'‚Äù

Clinton says she chose the first option. ‚ÄúI kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off,‚Äù she says.

But Clinton questions whether she should have chosen the second option. ‚ÄúIt certainly would have been better TV,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMaybe I have over-learned the lesson of staying calm, biting my tongue, digging my fingernails into a clenched fist, smiling all the while, determined to present a composed face to the world.‚Äù

Clinton says writing the book, due to be released in the coming weeks, ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt easy.‚Äù ‚ÄúEvery day that I was a candidate for president, I knew that millions of people were counting on me and I couldn‚Äôt bear the idea of letting them down. But I did,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get the job done.‚Äù

Boards: Many Gujarat teachers found errant in checking papers,"Representational Image Representational Image

The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) has found that nearly 8,000 teachers had slipped up while evaluating Class X and Class XII Board examination answer-sheets. In most cases, top Board officials said, the errors related to wrong summation of marks. These are teachers from different government, grant-in-aid and private schools from across the state who are appointed as evaluators and remunerated for their work.

According to officials, the number of teachers who slipped thus could be more, as the GSHSEB has shortlisted only those who erred by more than 10 marks. ‚ÄúAlthough candidates (students) are not at a loss, since the error was detected well in time during the second round of verification of totalling, it certainly is a huge loss of time, resources and energy,‚Äù GSHSEB chairman A J Shah said. ‚ÄúIf these unjustified mistakes were not made by evaluators, results could have been advanced, and resources utilised in other productive tasks.‚Äù

So what were the kinds of errors spotted in evaluation? In some cases, whole or parts of answers were not evaluated, while in some others duplication of answers and awarding marks were completely ignored. Marks were wrongly entered, and finally they were wrongly calculated, according to officials. ‚ÄúA move to call all such teachers for a hearing is expected to bring about a change in the attitude of these teachers,‚Äù GSHSEB‚Äôs Class X examination secretary B S Panchal said. Besides, he said, there is ‚Äúno parameter to identify whether these mistakes are intentional or unintentional‚Äù.

Shah said the Board has prepared a schedule, and from this week will start hearing 100 such teachers each day to verify whether there are any repeat offenders among them.

Russia‚Äôs World Cup stadium in Samara behind schedule,"Work on the new 45,000-seat stadium, one of 12 that will host World Cup matches next summer, has been plagued by delays over the past months. (Source: AP) Work on the new 45,000-seat stadium, one of 12 that will host World Cup matches next summer, has been plagued by delays over the past months. (Source: AP)

Construction work on the World Cup stadium in the Russian city of Samara is about 30 days behind schedule, the company building the venue said on Wednesday, adding it would make up the lost time.

Work on the new 45,000-seat stadium, one of 12 that will host World Cup matches next summer, has been plagued by delays over the past months.

‚ÄúWe would have liked a faster construction pace,‚Äù Sergei Ponomaryov, the deputy head of general contractor PSO Kazan, told reporters. ‚ÄúWe have calculated that we are behind by about 30 days.‚Äù

Ponomaryov said all major construction work at the venue would be finished by the end of the year, the initial deadline for its completion.

But on Wednesday cranes dominated the skyline above the venue and towering metal structures were supporting its roof.

The pitch also not been laid, unlike at some other venues being built for the tournament.

The governor of the Samara region, Nikolai Merkushkin, blamed the delay on unfavourable weather, including heavy rain in the Spring.

‚ÄúIn September we will be back on track,‚Äù he said.

Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said last month there was ‚Äúno doubt‚Äù the venue would be ready by the end of the year, TASS news agency reported.

The Samara Arena will host four group stage matches, a match in the round-of-16 and a quarter final.

"China‚Äôs second aircraft carrier to undergo trial soon, says report","Chinese President Xi Jinping. (Source: CCTV via AP Video) Chinese President Xi Jinping. (Source: CCTV via AP Video)

China‚Äôs second aircraft carrier is likely to start its first sea trials soon with the development to be presented as a key achievement of President Xi Jinping at the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs Congress expected to take place in October. The ‚Äúkey project‚Äù team has completed tasks ahead of schedule, Hu Wenming, the head and Party chief of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), the manufacturer of the Type 001A said. China has one aircraft carrier in operation now ‚Äî the ‚ÄòLiaoning‚Äô, which went into commission in 2012. The Type 001A is the country‚Äôs first home-grown aircraft carrier.

The Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Corp (DSIC) where it was built will greet the 19th CPC National Congress by delivering key achievements on a special product in this special time,‚Äù DSIC Chairman Liu Zheng was quoted as saying by state-run Global Times on Wednesday.

The Congress which is held every five years is expected to be held in October here. Xi, 64, who is completing his five year tenure as party general secretary, President and head of the Army, is widely believed to get a second term.

As per the practice of the CPC, top leaders will have a ten year tenure.

Liu said all personnel working on the key project led by the CSIC will stick to the directions of Xi to provide world-class naval equipment for a world-leading navy.

The ‚Äúspecial time‚Äù refers to the 19th Congress, which marks the opening of a new phase of China‚Äôs reforms. And the enhancement of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) navy‚Äôs combat capabilities is an important part of the country‚Äôs military reforms,‚Äù Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Daily.

Zhang Ye, a research fellow at the PLA Naval Research Institute said that if the Type 001A made in China can start its sea trials before the event, which is the last stage prior to turning the warship over to the navy, it would mark a huge step forward in China‚Äôs development of a stronger navy.

China has successfully tested the Type 001A‚Äôs power system and the carrier will undergo a mooring test in September ahead of schedule, meaning that the ship‚Äôs power system is all set.

Zhang said he believed part of the mooring test has already started even during the power test, so the mooring test period could be shorter than expected.

The schedule for the sea trials will depend on how long the mooring test takes, Zhang noted.

The sea trials will include an even more comprehensive performance test, which would cover the propelling and communications systems under different maritime conditions, which would usually take two years, Zhang said. He added the trials would not be limited to a specific weather condition.

‚ÄúThe Type 001A is an improved version of the Type 001 Liaoning, so the similarity and experience can largely speed things up,‚Äù Song Zhongping, a military expert who served in the Rocket (Missile Force) said.

China‚Äôs ‚ÄòLiaoning‚Äô is a refurbished aircraft carrier built from the hull of a Soviet ship bought from Ukraine in 1998. Regarded as an experimental vessel, it is taking part in battle group exercises in different seas.

The second ship, Type 001A weighs about 70,000 tonnes, is 315 metres long, 75 metres wide and has a cruising speed of 31 knots.

‚ÄúI seek the support of all fellow Indians to fly Air India our national carrier ‚Äì Air India ‚Äì Truly Indian,‚Äù he said.

Bansal replaced Ashwani Lohani, who has assumed office as Railway Board Chairman.

Britain outlines plans to break free of European Court after Brexit,"Britain‚Äôs Prime Minister Theresa May. (Reuters photo) Britain‚Äôs Prime Minister Theresa May. (Reuters photo)

Britain will outline its plans on Wednesday to escape the ‚Äúdirect jurisdiction‚Äù of the European Court of Justice after Brexit, one of Prime Minister Theresa May‚Äôs main aims in talks to unravel 40 years of EU membership. The plans will be laid out in one of the most politically sensitive documents Britain has published this month as it attempts to nudge negotiations with the European Union forward.

The government will try to show little compromise in what it calls a paper to ‚Äúreinforce the message that after Brexit, the UK will take back control of its laws‚Äù. But in qualifying her language by using the word ‚Äúdirect‚Äù before jurisdiction, opposition lawmakers said May had crossed her own ‚Äúred line‚Äù on taking back control, by accepting the court would have influence over British law.

Many pro-Brexit lawmakers in May‚Äôs governing Conservative Party say the European court, or ECJ, has slowly sucked power from Britain‚Äôs courts and parliament. But for the EU, the Luxembourg-based court is the ultimate arbiter of EU law and must protect its citizens, even those living in Britain.

‚ÄúWe have long been clear that in leaving the EU we will bring an ?end to the direct jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the UK,‚Äù a government source said.

‚ÄúThis paper takes the next steps as we prepare to engage constructively to negotiate our approach to this,‚Äù the source said, referring to the fourth paper Britain has released this week to try to move the negotiations beyond discussion of a divorce settlement and on to future ties.

Dominic Raab, a Brexit campaigner who is now minister for courts and justice, said Britain would most likely suggest Britain and the EU could appoint arbitrators and possibly agree a third party to deal with ‚Äúbones of contention‚Äù in future ties.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one possible alternative, but I think it‚Äôs the most likely,‚Äù he told BBC Radio Four, denying the use of the word ‚Äúdirect‚Äù signalled a shift in position. Opposition lawmakers said those accusations showed the weakness of May, who lost her party‚Äôs majority in an ill-judged election two months ago.

‚ÄúThe repeated reference to ending the ‚Äòdirect jurisdiction‚Äô of the ECJ is potentially significant. This appears to contradict the red line laid out ‚Ä¶ which stated there could be no future role of the ECJ and that all laws will be interpreted by judges in this country,‚Äù said Keir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the opposition Labour Party.

ALL BUT HALTED

The ECJ issue has all but halted debate on guaranteeing the rights of expatriates. A joint status document, published last month, comparing the EU and British positions shows that talks on those rights have come unstuck because of a dispute over the role of the ECJ.

In Britain‚Äôs paper on the ECJ, the government source said, May‚Äôs government would try to show ‚Äúexamples of existing ways of resolving disputes in international agreements‚Äù without the ECJ having direct jurisdiction, and it would be unprecedented if the court had jurisdiction over a non-member.

The ‚Äúfuture partnership paper‚Äù on judicial and political dispute resolution is part of Britain‚Äôs strategy to try to force the EU into discussing future ties alongside discussion of the divorce.

But the EU says it must see ‚Äúsufficient progress‚Äù in the first stage in talks ‚Äì on the rights of expatriates, Britain‚Äôs border with EU member Ireland and a financial settlement ‚Äì before moving on.

‚ÄúWe need to talk about the future very soon,‚Äù another British source said, echoing comments from all sides that the ‚Äúclock is ticking‚Äù.

Good prospects for India to achieve over 8 per cent growth in 2-3 years: Niti Aayog,"The 211-page document also calls for strengthening and streamlining regulatory structure governing sustainability of environment. The 211-page document also calls for strengthening and streamlining regulatory structure governing sustainability of environment.

India has good prospects of achieving over 8 per cent growth within 2-3 years, Niti Aayog said on Thursday, while suggesting a host of reforms to ensure prosperity for all the 125 crore citizens. The government think tank has come out with a detailed plan for reforms in the economy, judiciary, regulatory structure and social sectors, in its ‚ÄòThree Year Action Agenda, 2017-18 to 2019-20‚Äô.

‚ÄúIndeed, there are good prospects that we will return to 8 per cent plus growth trajectory in another 2-3 years if not sooner. Therefore, the chances of massive cut in the poverty rate in the upcoming decade are excellent,‚Äù it said. India‚Äôs economic growth slowed to 7.1 per cent in 2016- 17. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) is scheduled to release the growth number for the April-June quarter of the current fiscal on August 31.

The Action agenda proposes linking central government expenditure to future priorities, shifting additional allocations to high-priority sectors which are more likely to promote development. ‚ÄúThe proposals imply substantial expansion in expenditures by 2019-20 on education, health, agriculture, rural development, defence, railways, roads and other categories of capital expenditure,‚Äù the agenda said.

It suggested ways to facilitate urbanisation in the country and deal with key challenges like affordable housing, infrastructure development, pubic transport and promotion of Swachh Bharat. It also suggested host of actions to eliminate corruption and black money, and increase tax base besides recommending reforms in civil services and electoral process.

The suggestions for reforming the judicial system revolve around streamlining human resource availability and performance, increasing and strengthening avenues for dispute resolution and extensive use of ICT to improve efficiency. On the social sector, it talked of changes in segments like education, skill development, health and issues facing specific groups, such as scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and women.

The 211-page document also calls for strengthening and streamlining regulatory structure governing sustainability of environment.

"Air pollution at crisis levels in North India, says Niti Aayog; spells out three-year plan","It has identified coal power plants, brick kilns, vehicles, cooking and heating fires which burn biomass, rubbish burning and burning of crop residue and dust from construction as the ‚Äúmajor‚Äù source of air pollution. It has identified coal power plants, brick kilns, vehicles, cooking and heating fires which burn biomass, rubbish burning and burning of crop residue and dust from construction as the ‚Äúmajor‚Äù source of air pollution.

Noting that air pollution has reached crisis level in Northern India, government think-tank Niti Aayog has recommended a slew of measures like imposing higher taxes on petrol in and around the more polluted cities to encourage commuters to share cars and take public transportation. The Aayog, in its ‚ÄòThree Year Action Agenda to be implemented till 2019-20‚Äô and released by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, also suggested making public transportation faster and more comfortable to discourage the use of private vehicles.

It has identified coal power plants, brick kilns, vehicles, cooking and heating fires which burn biomass, rubbish burning and burning of crop residue and dust from construction as the ‚Äúmajor‚Äù source of air pollution. It noted that air pollution has reached crisis levels in Northern India and though it is much publicised in Delhi, it is also widespread in many other cities and as many as ten of the top 20 most polluted cities in the world are in India.

It recommended actions like finding alternatives to crop residue burning, reducing pollution from cooking fires and installing flu gas de-sulpherizers on all coal power plants in or close to densely populated areas except those less than 5MW capacity and those older than 25 years by 2020.

It also suggested switching to cleaner technologies to reduce pollution from brick kilns considerably within three years. ‚ÄúA number of complementary steps can be taken (to reduce in-city-vehicle pollution). First making public transportation faster and more comfortable will discourage the use of private vehicles.

‚ÄúMetro or bus based rapid transit systems connecting suburbs and city centre and a dense in-city transport system will go some distance towards achieving the objective,‚Äù it proposed. It also talked about replacement of vehicles from petrol and diesel to CNG, infrastructure improvements which allow vehicles travelling long distances to bypass the cities without entering, higher taxes on petrol to encourage commuters to share cars and other measures to cut emissions.

‚ÄúHigher taxes on petrol in and around more polluted cities would encourage commuters to share cars and take public transportation. ‚ÄúHigher parking fees and park and ride facilities will have similar effects,‚Äù it recommended. As far finding alternatives to crop residue burning was concerned, the document noted that ‚ÄòHappy Seeder‚Äô, a machine developed by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO Australia) and Punjab Agricultural University, allows planting of wheat through the residue.

It said that the machine was introduced about five years ago and has been shown to reduce field preparation costs marginally and maintain yields and profits of wheat, which has led some farmers to adopt it. ‚ÄúIn view of the urgency of the problem and the large benefit from putting an end to crop residue burning, a larger subsidy on the machine for limited time complemented by extension and information campaigns may eliminate the problem within the next three years,‚Äù it said.

It also suggested installation of Flue-gas De-sulphurizers on all coal power plants in or close to densely populated areas except those less than 5 MW capacity and those older than 25 years by 2020. The older power plants should be shut down and retired in a phased manner, it said while adding that this will cut emissions of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) gas that becomes sulphate particles in the atmosphere.

‚ÄúIt will also reduce particulate (smoke) emissions directly. ‚ÄúThe average cost of doing this along with improvements in fly ash removal and control of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions has been estimated to be 35-40 paise/KWh, and could reduce the PM2.5 concentrations by 30-40 per cent,‚Äù it recommended.

John Coates stands firm despite criticism of AOC culture,"John Coates told a news conference that any misbehaviour detailed in the review was committed by others. (Source: Reuters) John Coates told a news conference that any misbehaviour detailed in the review was committed by others. (Source: Reuters)

John Coates, the long-serving President of the Australian Olympic Committee, refused to accept any responsibility for flaws in the culture of the organisation outlined in a report released on Wednesday.

The Independent Cultural Review revealed that some AOC staff viewed the organisation as ‚Äúdysfunctional‚Äù and had witnessed ‚Äú‚Äòdeceitful‚Äô, ‚Äòtwo-faced‚Äô, ‚Äòegotistic‚Äô and/or ‚Äòbelligerent'‚Äù behaviour from senior staff.

Coates told a news conference that any misbehaviour detailed in the review was committed by others, many who were no longer at the AOC, and he certainly would not be standing down from his position. ‚ÄúWhy should I resign?‚Äù the lawyer said at a news conference in Sydney.

‚ÄúThere has been no confirmation of bullying. There has been some criticism of the senior leaders ‚Äî I‚Äôm the president, I‚Äôm not the senior leader that is being criticised.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm president and there‚Äôs been a succession of CEOs under me. I have not swept anything under the carpet. There‚Äôs plenty of acknowledgements (in the report) of the staff having pride in me and what I have achieved for the Olympic movement‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm happy to be judged on that.‚Äù

The report said stakeholders perceived that Coates exercised ‚Äúoverriding influence or control over the AOC‚Äù.

BULLYING ALLEGATIONS

Coates has presided over a difficult year for the AOC after a Rio Olympics campaign that featured controversy away from the sporting arena and disappointing results in it.

There followed a challenge to his presidency of the AOC, which he has run for 27 years, sparked by a feud with Australian Sports Commission chief John Wylie.

Coates successfully quashed that challenge in May but his media director Mike Tancred was stood down and reprimanded during the campaign after being found guilty of ‚Äúdisreputable conduct‚Äù towards former chief executive Fiona de Jong.

That led to a string of bullying allegations appearing in the media and resulted in the commissioning of the review by the Sydney-based Ethics Centre, which suggested the AOC needed to modernise.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very with pleased with this report because the first recommendation addresses the big issue for us because that addresses the governance model,‚Äù the International Olympic Committee vice-president said.

‚ÄúWe need to assess if it is fit for purpose for an organisation like us.‚Äù New chief executive Matt Carroll said the AOC would implement all 17 recommendations of the review, which presented the body with a ‚Äúplatform to reset the organisation‚Äù.

Coates also announced that Australia would have a new Chef de Mission for the third straight Summer Olympics with Ian Chesterman, who has led six Winter Olympic teams, replacing Kitty Chiller for Tokyo 2020.

Chiller, who in turn replaced 2012 team leader Nick Green, had informed the AOC she did not want to continue in the role two weeks ago, Coates confirmed.

"US President Donald Trump tweets weird articles of his ego-driven thoughts, spouts rubbish: North Korea","After a July missile test by North Korea, Trump went on Twitter to ask whether Kim has ‚Äúanything better to do with his life?‚Äù (Image source ‚Äì Reuters) After a July missile test by North Korea, Trump went on Twitter to ask whether Kim has ‚Äúanything better to do with his life?‚Äù (Image source ‚Äì Reuters)

North Korea today described President Donald Trump as a leader who frequently tweets ‚Äúweird articles of his ego-driven thoughts‚Äù and ‚Äúspouts rubbish‚Äù to give his assistants a hard time. The North‚Äôs official Korean Central News Agency made the comments in response to tough talk in Washington and Seoul over threats posed by Pyongyang‚Äôs nuclear and missile programs.

In the same commentary, KCNA also criticized South Korea‚Äôs ‚Äúpuppy-like‚Äù Defense Minister Song Young-moo, who it said was ‚Äúrunning wild‚Äù while relying on the ‚Äúmaster of the White House.‚Äù Song recently ordered the South‚Äôs military to be prepared to ‚Äúimmediately and sternly punish‚Äù any kind of provocation by North Korea, which has caused hostility with two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month and a threat to lob missiles toward the US territory of Guam.

‚ÄúTrump spouted rubbish that if a war breaks out, it would be on the Korean Peninsula, and if thousands of people die, they would be only Koreans and Americans may sleep a sound sleep,‚Äù KCNA wrote, ridiculing Song for ‚Äúpinning hope on that mad guy.‚Äù

The agency‚Äôs comments came hours after North Korea‚Äôs military issued its standard fiery threats over ongoing joint military exercises between the US and South Korean militaries, vowing ‚Äúmerciless retaliation‚Äù for exercises Pyongyang claims are an invasion rehearsal. The allies describe the annual war games as defensive in nature.

North Korea has unleashed personal attacks on past Washington and Seoul leaders, calling former President Barack Obama a monkey and ex-South Korean President Park Geun-hye a prostitute. Trump was previously described in North Korean state media as ‚Äúgoing senile‚Äù and a ‚Äúwar maniac bereft of reason.‚Äù

Trump has used Twitter to launch his own insults at North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong Un. On August 11, Trump tweeted that military solutions were ‚Äúfully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely‚Äù amid the standoff between Washington and Pyongyang over the Guam missile threat. But he complimented Kim five days later for making a ‚Äúvery wise and well reasoned decision‚Äù after Pyongyang walked away from the threat.

After a July missile test by North Korea, Trump went on Twitter to ask whether Kim has ‚Äúanything better to do with his life?‚Äù ‚ÄùHard to believe that South Korea ‚Ä¶ and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!‚Äù Trump wrote.

‚ÄòBCCI a male chauvinist organisation‚Ä¶ difficult for them to accept women‚Äôs team has done well‚Äô,"Diana Edulji, Naseeruddin Shah, Punam Raut, Harmanpreet Kaur at the Express Adda in Mumbai, Tuesday. (Source: Express Photo/Dilip Kagda) Diana Edulji, Naseeruddin Shah, Punam Raut, Harmanpreet Kaur at the Express Adda in Mumbai, Tuesday. (Source: Express Photo/Dilip Kagda)

CALLING THE Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) a ‚Äúmale chauvinist organisation‚Äù, former India skipper Diana Edulji, who is now a member of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA), said the recent success of the women‚Äôs cricket team hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúaccepted too well‚Äù by some BCCI members. Edulji, along with India‚Äôs World Cup stars Harmanpreet Kaur and Punam Raut, was a guest at the Express Adda event in Mumbai on Tuesday.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been a BCCI basher, right from the day women‚Äôs cricket came into the BCCI fold in 2006. BCCI is a very male chauvinist organisation. They never wanted women to dictate terms or get into this thing. I was very vocal right from my playing days, from when I started,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEven now, I would still say that it is not yet well accepted within BCCI that women‚Äôs cricket is doing well. It is very difficult for them (some BCCI members) to accept the fact that this team has done very well,‚Äù said Edulji.

Recalling her first meeting with former BCCI president N Srinivasan after he took over the reins in 2011, she said, ‚ÄúWhen Mr Srinivasan became president, I would like to say that I went to congratulate him at the Wankhede Stadium. He said, ‚ÄòIf I had my way, I wouldn‚Äôt let women‚Äôs cricket happen‚Äô. He hates women‚Äôs cricket.‚Äù

Kaur and Raut were among the star performers during India‚Äôs remarkable World Cup campaign in England last month where they finished nine runs short of a title win. The two said they were humbled and surprised by the overwhelming reception upon their return home. While they acknowledged the meteoric rise in interest levels regarding women‚Äôs cricket in the country, Raut recalled some of the comments that she had to endure when she took up cricket seriously.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much passion for cricket within us that we don‚Äôt ever think about getting tanned or that hum kaale ho jaayenge. There were many people in our society and some of my mother‚Äôs friends who would keep saying, ‚ÄòIsse ladki ki tarah thoda rehne ke liye sikhao. Ladki ke kaam sikhao‚Äô .They used to ask my mother to teach me to dress up like a girl. My mother would then scold me. I would complain to my father and then they would end up arguing,‚Äù she said.

Raut added that young girls need to chase their dreams. ‚ÄúThere are many parents who still think along those lines‚Ä¶ You‚Äôll get dark if you stay under the sun for six hours. Who‚Äôll get married to you? I‚Äôve seen today‚Äôs parents only encourage their daughters to study and say that you‚Äôll have to get married at a fixed age and get settled. I believe if any girl likes playing, or if sport is her passion, then they should be allowed to play and be supported too,‚Äù she said.

Kaur, who after her match-winning 171 in the World Cup semi-final against Australia is being seen as the poster girl of women‚Äôs cricket in India, spoke about her days of struggle, growing up in Moga, Punjab. ‚ÄúWhen I was young I would have to beg the girls to play with me so that we could form a team of 11 players. Eventually, I would have to gather girls who were good at other sports. Cricket has become their No.1 priority now. When I started, there wasn‚Äôt a single academy in Moga. My coach started one just for me. Now, there are three exclusively for women,‚Äù said Kaur.

The three guests also responded to questions from the audience on various issues, including the possibility of having an IPL for women. While Edulji felt it was still too early for this, both Kaur and Raut said they would love for it to happen soon. ‚ÄúI feel like even after all that‚Äôs happened, there are a lot of changes that still need to be made for women‚Äôs cricket. I hope we don‚Äôt end up saying many years later that ‚Äòwe also used to hit sixes during our time‚Äô. So, I feel if IPL starts now, then it‚Äôs great,‚Äù said Kaur.

In the freewheeling interaction, the three guests spoke on a range of other topics ‚Äî the longstanding support from the Railways for women‚Äôs cricket, their cricket battles against boys in their early days, and the possibility of appearing in television advertisements.

The Express Adda is a series of informal interactions organised by The Indian Express Group and features people who have been at the centre of change. Guests at the event in the past include the Dalai Lama, economist and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, filmmaker Karan Johar, Union Minister Piyush Goyal, writer Amitav Ghosh and cricketer Virat Kohli.

Ileana D‚ÄôCruz or Yami Gautam: Who wore the black pantsuit better?,"From L to R: Ileana D‚ÄôCruz and Yami Gautam. (Source: Instagram/stylebyami, pinkvilla) From L to R: Ileana D‚ÄôCruz and Yami Gautam. (Source: Instagram/stylebyami, pinkvilla)

Just like a black tuxedo, a black pantsuit is the epitome of class and elegance. Over the years, Bollywood beauties have shown us different ways to wear the statement-making separates and a few of them have been really bold. We still can‚Äôt get over Sapna Pabbi‚Äôs pink pantsuit that she wore to Stardust Awards in 2015. Also, Alia Bhatt in an all-white, satin powersuit from Emporio Armani and a pair of sexy black heels from Christian Louboutin for the premier episode of Koffee With Karan Season 5 cut a fine figure. Now, making waves once again is Ileana D‚ÄôCruz and Yami Gautam in suits.

For a promotional event for her upcoming film Baadshaho, co-starring Ajay Devgn, Ileana D‚Äôcruz looked striking in a crisp black suit from Osman‚Äôs Pre Fall 2016 collection. We love how she took it to the next level by pairing it with a white pussy bow blouse from Twelve AM:PM and really chic Christian Louboutin heels.

The statement ring from Isharya added some bling to her outfit. We think she looked lovely with a chic ponytail and a bright red pout.

Meanwhile, Yami Gautam who was in Delhi to attend a mobile launch event was seen in a black suit by Intrinsic by Muskaan Goswami. Celebrity stylist Ami Patel styled it with a lace-up neck detail white top and sky high black strappy heels.

We think she did well with the voluminous, messy ponytail and muted-makeup but D‚ÄôCruz stole the show here. She wins hands down.

What about you? Which look do you like the most? Let us know in the comments below.

State of the Union,"Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran. Keeping India Safe by Vappala Balachandran.

The flaws in India‚Äôs internal security management and how it impacts our image in international fora

Title: Keeping India Safe: The Dilemma of Internal Security

Author: Vappala Balachandran

Publisher: Harper Collins

Pages: 328 pages

Price: Rs 599

Internal security provides the foundation for external security and our prestige in international fora. If there are a hundred points of insurgency, disaffection or rebellion, those weaken the social structure and hamper economic growth, and news about these unrests affects other countries‚Äô judgement about our handling of sensitive matters. Unfortunately, our policy makers have not paid adequate attention to this vital sector and their threat responses have been influenced more by political considerations than strategic vision. Much was expected of the NDA government, but unfortunately, it has also disappointed ‚Äî so far, at least.

Balachandran‚Äôs book on internal security is a valuable addition to the literature on the subject. He has drawn our attention to fundamental flaws in the Constitution which are adversely affecting our handling of internal security challenges. The founding fathers, as he says, copied the Act of 1935 while dividing Centre-state subjects without considering whether it would safeguard national integrity in times of turbulence. They should have given concurrent responsibility to the Centre to deal with national security threats, and not doing so was ‚Äúcertainly a lapse‚Äù. This view is supported by leading Constitutional experts like Fali Nariman. Not that the government is unaware of it, but it fears opposition from states. The reality has to be faced, and the sooner we do it the better.

Balachandran is on target when he says that after 26/11, the nation was united against the scourge of terrorism, and that it was an ideal opportunity to amend the Constitution and create a federal police which would investigate terror and other cases which had all-India ramifications. ‚ÄúWhat was however produced was a partly empowered police (the NIA)‚Äù. It was a ‚Äúleadership failure‚Äù of the UPA government.

The author also writes of institutions which are either dysfunctional or have no statutory basis. The National Security Council, which should have played a key role, is one of these, thanks to its unclear charter. The National Security Advisory Board is a collection of the best brains in the field of security, but the government has not made use of this vast reservoir of talent. What is worse, the organisation became defunct under the NDA regime, though lately, it has been revived in an emaciated form. The Crisis Management Group could never rise to the occasion, whether in the assassination of Mrs Indira Gandhi or the hijacking of IC-814 or the 26/11 attack. The Intelligence Bureau should have an oversight mechanism and be made accountable. The CBI also requires a legal mandate and greater autonomy in personnel and finance. The Ministry of Home Affairs has become unwieldy and needs to be bifurcated, with a separate division for internal security alone. All these are valuable points and need to be acted upon at the highest level.

The most interesting chapter deals with 26/11. It clearly brings out that the Centre had not passed on any specific intelligence to the State, that the police had reacted promptly with their available resources, and that there was no serious lapse. But the state government could have tightened coastal surveillance and made provisions for equipment and arms easier for the police. The political leadership and bureaucracy were to blame for that. Were they held accountable? Why the Centre didn‚Äôt institute an inquiry into the lapses of 26/11 remains a mystery to this day. According to knowledgeable people, the inquiry was not set up because several senior officers in Delhi would have been found guilty.

The NDA government, according to the author, has shown ‚Äúno interest in revising the stagnant thinking on national security‚Äù. The indictment is a bit harsh. The government has taken some initiatives to improve the police and tackle Maoists, but these efforts have not been as comprehensive as was required. The author has also faulted the NDA government for ‚Äúimmaturely‚Äù dealing with the Naga problem. The brain behind the framework agreement with the NSCN (IM) was of one of the finest officers of the country. If the framework could not be given a final shape, it is essentially because of the duplicity of the Naga leaders.

The book is full of facts and figures on foreign security agencies. Researchers would find these useful. But William Henry Sleeman has been given more space than he deserved. The detailed accounts of thuggee are, nevertheless, interesting.

Donald Trump to visit section of US-Mexican border wall in Arizona,"Donald Trump has said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first. (Photo: Reuters) Donald Trump has said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first. (Photo: Reuters)

President Donald Trump will visit a section of a US-Mexican border fence in Arizona on Tuesday as he seeks congressional funding for the wall he wants built, administration officials said on Monday. Trump, who has struggled to persuade the Republican-led Congress to approve funding for a project many see as unnecessary, is to visit a border facility at Yuma, Arizona.

The border area at Yuma is considered a success story for the US Border Patrol because illegal crossings have slowed as a result of the border installation. During his visit, Trump will be briefed on Border Patrol efforts in the region and the need for more funding for immigration and border officials to carry out the Republican president‚Äôs desire for sharp limits on illegal immigration, the officials said.

The proposed border wall, aimed at preventing illegal immigration to the United States, was one of Trump‚Äôs major 2016 campaign promises. His vow that Mexico would pay for the wall, which the Mexican government has insisted it will not do, has strained relations between the two neighbors. Trump has since said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first.

"9,000 kg of plastic seized since Green Tribunal ban, but no one knows how to get rid of it","While the govt and MCDs are looking at disposal options, an SDMC official said the bags will probably end up in landfills While the govt and MCDs are looking at disposal options, an SDMC official said the bags will probably end up in landfills

With the National Green Tribunal (NGT) completely banning plastic ‚Äúless than 50 microns‚Äù, the Delhi government and the three municipal corporations have collected nearly 9,000 kg of plastic. But there‚Äôs one problem: No one knows where to dispose of it. Earlier this month, the NGT had reinforced its ban and slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 on anyone found in possession of non-biodegradable plastic bags.

Since then, the government and the MCDs have been on a war footing to implement the ban. While the government said a total of 7,739 kg of plastic bags had been seized and Rs 2.9 lakh collected as environmental compensation, the civic bodies said they had seized 1,200 kg of bags and collected over a lakh as compensation. Environment Minister Imran Hussain also directed officials to ‚Äústrictly implement the NGT‚Äôs directions‚Äù and ‚Äúsend regular action-taken reports‚Äù.

However, the larger problem of disposing the bags remains. If dumped in landfills, they can continue polluting the environment for a millennium, officials said. While the Bureau of Indian Standards‚Äô ‚ÄòGuidelines for Recycling of Plastics‚Äô stipulates a three-pronged process of recycling plastic (selection, segregation and processing), this doesn‚Äôt apply to plastic material thinner than 50 microns, since it simply can‚Äôt be recycled.

The government also admitted that disposing the plastic amassed ‚Äî due to the sheer volume ‚Äî was a problem. A spokesperson said, ‚ÄúThe government has collected the plastic waste and the MCDs are trying to figure out a solution.‚Äù A solution, though, is hardly on the horizon. A senior SDMC official said, ‚ÄúThere is simply too much plastic waste. We are trying to figure out different options, including sending them to waste-to-energy plants. We are also speaking to different recycling units. But in all likelihood, they will end up at a landfill.‚Äù

Cautioning against this, Swati Singh Sambhyal, programme officer at Centre for Science and Environment, said, ‚ÄúDumping plastic at a landfill will defeat the purpose of the ban. Burning it is also not an option. While they (authorities) can speak to different waste-to-energy plants, it will also not be without potential pollution. A solution for now would be to stock it, but the larger focus needs to be on stopping manufacture of such plastic.‚Äù

As per DPCC sources, a number of unregistered units concentrated around the Bawana industrial area continue to thrive. ‚ÄúThe economics is simple. These bags are cheaper than anything else in the market. So traders buy it and consumers use it,‚Äù an official said. Sambhyal added, ‚ÄúThere needs to be monitoring, along with a sustained campaign to subsidise alternate bags, such as jute or cloth, for a long-term solution.‚Äù

China commits to cut northern air pollution by 15 per cent,"A paramilitary police officer wearing a mask stands guard in front of a portrait of the late Chairman Mao Zedong during smog at Tiananmen Square after a red alert was issued for heavy air pollution in Beijing, China. (Reuters File Photo) A paramilitary police officer wearing a mask stands guard in front of a portrait of the late Chairman Mao Zedong during smog at Tiananmen Square after a red alert was issued for heavy air pollution in Beijing, China. (Reuters File Photo)

China has pledged to cut average concentrations of airborne particles known as PM2.5 by more than 15 percent year-on-year in the winter months in 28 northern cities to meet key smog targets, the environment ministry said. In a 143-page winter smog ‚Äúbattleplan‚Äù posted on its website on Thursday, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said the new target, for the October to March period, would apply to Beijing and Tianjin, along with 26 other cities in the smog-prone provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong and Henan.

China‚Äôs efforts to control pollution have often roiled the prices of steel, iron ore and coal with output routinely curtailed as a result of emergency smog regulations and inspection campaigns.

China is under pressure this year to meet politically important 2017 air quality targets. It aims to cut 2012 levels of PM2.5 by more than a quarter in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and bring average concentrations down to 60 micrograms per cubic metre in the Chinese capital.

But PM2.5 averages rose in the first seven months of the year as a result of near record-high smog in January and February, which China blamed on ‚Äúunfavourable weather conditions‚Äù.

Experts still believe, however, that China remains on course to meet the 2017 targets set out in a groundbreaking air quality action plan published by the government in 2013.

‚ÄúActually, air quality from April to June was among the best over the last five years in Beijing and we still have confidence in achieving the target,‚Äù said Shelley Yang, a project manager at the Clean Air Alliance of China (CAAC), a non-profit organisation that includes academic, government and corporate organisations that ‚Äúcare about clean air‚Äù.

The extremely high PM2.5 levels in January and February will also make it easier for cities to achieve the 15 percent cut in the new year.

The government is still leaving nothing to chance, with some of China‚Äôs smoggiest cities under pressure to complete annual steel and coal closure targets by the end of September and implement tougher restrictions in the following months.

By October, big steelmaking cities like Tangshan and Handan must have plans in place to cut output by as much as 50 percent to limit smog during the winter heating season starting in November.

The region is also under pressure to eliminate thousands of coal-fired boilers, further restrict coal haulage on roads and ensure that power generators, steel mills and coking plants complete upgrades aimed at controlling emissions before heating systems are switched on.

Hebei is responsible for a quarter of China‚Äôs steel output, with Tangshan alone producing around 100 million tonnes a year, more than the United States. Neighbouring Shanxi is China‚Äôs biggest coal producer, with more than 900 million tonnes of annual output.

In a note this week, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said the winter restrictions could also reduce primary aluminium output by 400,000 tonnes this year.

In a separate notice on Thursday, the Hebei government promised to use an ‚Äúiron fist‚Äù to deal with air pollution over the winter.

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber,file)

The European Commission has started an in-depth investigation of Bayer‚Äôs planned $66 billion takeover of US seeds group Monsanto, saying it was worried about competition in pesticide and seeds markets. The merger would create the world‚Äôs largest integrated pesticides and seeds company, the Commission said, adding this limited the amount of competitors selling herbicides and vegetable seeds in Europe.

‚ÄúThe Commission has preliminary concerns that the proposed acquisition could reduce competition in a number of different markets resulting in higher prices, lower quality, less choice and less innovation,‚Äù the European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday. Germany‚Äôs Bayer said it still aimed to have the transaction approved by the end of the year.

‚ÄúBayer looks forward to continuing to work constructively with the Commission with a view to obtaining the Commission‚Äôs approval,‚Äù the company said in a statement. Bayer had previously offered commitments aimed at easing the EU‚Äôs antitrust concerns over the deal with Monsanto, but the company declined to say what was proposed.

If approved, the deal would be the third large tie-up in the agrochemicals sector but other companies also had to offer concessions to win over regulators. Dow secured regulatory clearance to acquire DuPont only after pledging to sell key research and development activities and other major assets.

And ChemChina had to sell a large chunk of its subsidiary Adama‚Äôs pesticide, herbicides and insecticides business, its seed treatment products for cereals and sugar beet and a substantial part of its plant growth regulator business for cereals to win EU approval to buy Syngenta. The Commission said it was working with regulators in other markets, such as the Unted States, Australia and Brazil to vet the Bayer-Monsanto deal.

Bayer offered to sell its Liberty crop chemical, also known as glufosinate, and canola and cotton seeds that resist the chemical‚Äôs plant-killing effect to get approval for the deal from South African regulators. The proposed tie-up has also hit a raw nerve with some environmental activists who fear such a combination would hurt farmers and consumers.

US based campaign group Avaaz said it had submitted a petition with one million signatures to Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, calling on her to block the deal. ‚ÄúOver a million people are calling on her to block the merger from hell,‚Äù said Avaaz legal director Nick Flynn. The Commission said it would asses the deal only from a competition perspective.

Patient languishing in Sewri tuberclosis hospital for three years in Mumbai,"Chaburao‚Äôs case highlights the huge rate of abandonment of TB patients by their family due to the social stigma attached with the ailment. Chaburao‚Äôs case highlights the huge rate of abandonment of TB patients by their family due to the social stigma attached with the ailment.

At 39, Asha Chaburao‚Äôs only companions are two stray cats, one curled on her stomach, the other by her legs. Her nails have turned yellow. Her skin has turned scaly, owing to an infection. In Asia‚Äôs largest tuberculosis facility ‚Äî the Sewri TB Hospital ‚Äì Chaburao is one of the longest admitted patients. She stopped taking medication for tuberculosis two years ago, but continues to remain admitted as the hospital has been unable to reach out to her family who can take her home.

Chaburao‚Äôs case highlights the huge rate of abandonment of TB patients by their family due to the social stigma attached with the ailment. In 2014, medical documents accessed by The Indian Express show, her son Gajanand Chaburao admitted her with pulmonary TB. He visited her once the same year, and has not returned since.

She is now called bed number 356. Another patient Shehnaaz Banu says Chaburao has stopped talking, does not move out of her cot and has to be sponged on the bed by nurses. ‚ÄúWe change her diaper twice a day,‚Äù a nurse said. The hospital provides a fresh sheet twice a week for one patient, and if she soils her bed, the sheet cannot be changed until fresh supply comes.

In 2015, the hospital mailed a letter to her address in Airoli, but received no response. Calls to her son went unanswered. Since then, Chaburao stopped taking anti-TB medication. A senior medical officer in the hospital said, ‚ÄúWe see her lying silently all day. She does not require any surgery. Since she has not given her sputum, no test can be carried to check whether she still has TB.‚Äù

Chaburao shares her hospital food with the two cats. Sweepers claim they try to shoo away the cats, but they find their way back to her. A nurse who looked after her in 2014 and 2015 said she would earlier speak with hospital staff about her treatment and her family. ‚ÄúBut when she realised they had abandoned her, she went into depression. Now she only smiles when we give her food. She tugs at staffers when she urinates in bed,‚Äù the nurse said.

According to records, in 2015, Chaburao was put on Category 2 treatment, which was later stopped. While hospital staff claims they bathe the 39-year-old patient once a week, patients around her allege she is bathed only once every few weeks.

According to Praful Patel, counselor in the hospital from Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), a lot of patients admitted here are street dwellers who do not have a family to return to. The hospital has attached itself with MSF and TISS for counselling services. A single post of medical social worker, however, remains vacant.

While Dr Vijay Naringrekar, hospital superintendent, refused to comment, Dr Padmaja Keskar, BMC executive health officer, said there is a need for other bodies to support the government in rehabilitation of abandoned patients. ‚ÄúWe have three-four such cases in the hospital. Our doctors can counsel patients and family on treatment and need for social support, but when patients are abandoned, we can only keep them admitted,‚Äù Keskar said.

"Mercy, My Jewels!","Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‚ÄòMona Lisa of the North‚Äô, by Johannes Vermeer Girl with a Pearl Earring, the ‚ÄòMona Lisa of the North‚Äô, by Johannes Vermeer

Book- The Ring of Truth: Myths of Sex and Jewelry

Author- Wendy Doniger

Publication- Speaking Tiger

Pages- 397

Price- Rs 899

Wendy Doniger‚Äôs latest book, The Ring of Truth, has 45 pages of notes and a 30-page index. Yet, it is so much more than a well-annotated and minutely referenced compendium of stories about rings, lost and found, about how jewelry can establish the identity of a person or jog a buried memory of love. In Doniger‚Äôs agile mind and in her skilful hands, these become stories, as the very clever pun in the title suggests, about truth and reality, about how memory, recognition and human consciousness work for the self and for the other.

The stories in the book come from many genres, cultures and languages, but the paradigmatic story here is Kalidasa‚Äôs Shakuntala ‚Äî a story about an innocent forest girl who loses the ring of recognition that the king, her ‚Äòhusband,‚Äô gives her and then is denied physical as well as psychic recognition on account of its absence. When Dushyanta sees the ring many years later, he remembers his lost love and travels through the three worlds to find her and the son that she bore him. The child he encounters is proved to be his son through another piece of jewelry, a band that he wears on his arm. Eventually, all memories are restored, everyone is proved to be who they said they were and the family is reunited in love and happiness. A crucial character in this story is the fish who swallowed the ring that went missing ‚Äì the fish, too, becomes a motif in the ocean of stories that Doniger draws upon.

Doniger takes the many strands of Kalidasa‚Äôs story and weaves them into other stories from around the world, indicating how they are alike or different from each other. But, unlike so many other gatherers of tales that resemble each other (Stith Thompson and Alan Dundes, for example), Doniger does not care about a mere taxonomy. Her interest lies not in what these stories tell us about themselves and each other, but what they tell us about ourselves ‚Äî how we think, how we feel, how we construct reality, how we love those that we do and what it is, both within and without ourselves, that is lost when we lose our lovers and our memories.

Although she never leaves the world of classical mythology behind, as the sutradhar who holds the thread of rings and memory, Doniger takes us on a whirlwind tour of narratives from opera, works from 19th and 20th century literature, many contemporary works of fiction as well as to her other great love, the movies. In this volume, we get (re)acquainted with the Celtic fairy Morgana, Lancelot and Guinevere, Tristan and Isolde, Siegfried and Brunhilde, various Shakespeare plays and a host of other lovers who are separated from each other, who cheat on each other in moments of ring-induced forgetfulness, who use rings and other personal objects to reveal their true identities or to unmask imposters.

There is also a fascinatingly detailed chapter about Marie Antoinette‚Äôs diamond necklace, a rather large, heavy and expensive piece of jewelry which, though entirely non-existent, took the allegedly extravagant and heartless queen to the guillotine. Reminding us that even in the real world, a piece of jewelry can be a potent symbol, a metonym, in fact, for a person, Doniger traces the story of this necklace-that-never-was through various historical sources. The factually verifiable version that Doniger produces of the queens and knaves, the kings and priests, the cuckolds and mistresses that animate the saga of the necklace would put Alexander Dumas to shame. Later in the book, a corollary to this chapter about the Queen‚Äôs Necklace is a thoroughly enjoyable, wise and witty takedown of De Beers, the company that markets diamonds as ‚Äòsymbols, myths, magic.‚Äô (p.259)

Doniger tells us that The Ring of Truth actually split off from an earlier book for which she was collecting stories (The Woman who Pretended to be Who She Was, 2004). And, so it is that this book about rings of truth stays with many of Doniger‚Äôs favourite themes and recurrent concerns, such as sexual masquerade and substitution. Although she often refers to conventional Freudian readings of myth about real and imagined sexual encounters, Doniger is not afraid to call some of these encounters between men and beguiled (and most often, helpless) women ‚Äòrape,‚Äô for that is what they more correctly are. By analysing whatever devices of enchantment (curses, disguises, amnesia, darkness, fog) these stories use, she brings the essential nature of the pivotal sexual encounter to our attention. This persuades us to recognise how violence ‚Äî emotional, physical and sexual ‚Äî against women is prevalent in all cultures, hard-wired, as it is, into the stories that human beings love to tell over and over again.

Having said that, this is hardly the point of the book, which is anything but a feminist polemic against telling stories about women who lose their rings and are forgotten (or sometimes, ‚Äòmisremembered‚Äô) by their lovers. Rather, it is a book that revels precisely in these stories and the myriad ways in which we tell them. While the stories are often about sexual violence, they are even more about the cognitive violence inflicted upon the self and the other by forgetting or by the wilful erasure of memory. At a time when the danger of systematic cognitive violence against truth and memory is all too real, it is comforting to read a book which reminds you that memories can be restored, that truth can return, to heal both life and love.

Hindu man embraces Islam with family in Madhya Pradesh,"Google Maps Google Maps

TWENTY-EIGHT years after his inter-religious marriage, a Hindu man in Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh has embraced Islam with his wife and three children, alleging that his immediate family and other relatives never accepted them and subjected them to insults and neglect. Vinod Khare, a chaat vendor in Rajnagar town, had married Shah Bano according to Hindu rituals. His wife took the name Bina and the couple had three children. The couple and their eldest child, Ekta, told local reporters that they could not bear the insults and decided to embrace Islam.

In an affidavit made a few days ago, Vinod changed his name to Ghulam Mohammed Khan, Bina adopted her old name Shah Bano while Ekta, Aman and Suraj respectively took the names Fatima, Aman Mohammed and Mohammed Aftab.

"Globally 8 in 1,000 kids born with foetal alcohol syndrome","It is very important for expecting mothers to be aware of the ill-effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Source: File Photo) It is very important for expecting mothers to be aware of the ill-effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Source: File Photo)

Nearly eight out of every 1,000 children worldwide are born with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), which increases their risk of developing physical, mental, behavioural and learning disabilities, according to researchers.

The study estimated that one out of 13 women, who consumed alcohol at any point or frequently during pregnancy, gave birth to a child with FASD.

‚ÄúFASD prevalence estimates are essential to effectively prioritise and plan health care for children with FASD who are often misdiagnosed,‚Äù said Svetlana Popova, Senior Scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Ontario.

‚ÄúMost of these children will require lifelong care, so the earlier they have access to appropriate therapy and supports, the better their long-term health and social outcomes will be,‚Äù Popova added. For the study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, the team looked at the prevalence ‚Äî or the frequency that FASD‚Äîoccurs for children from birth to age 16 in 187 countries.

While the European region reported the highest levels worldwide at nearly 20 cases of FASD per 1,000 children, the Eastern Mediterranean Region has showed the lowest FASD prevalence. The US showed 15 cases of FASD per 1,000 children, while Canada reported eight cases per 1,000 children. In 76 countries, more than one out of 100 young people reported FASD.

The researchers also found that FASD occurred more frequently among children in care (such as foster care or orphanages), in the criminal justice system, in psychiatric care and aboriginal young people compared to the general population.

‚ÄúThere is a need for targeted screening and diagnosis for these high-risk populations as well as interventions to prevent alcohol use among mothers of children with FASD in relation to subsequent pregnancies,‚Äù Popova said.

Public health messages about the risks of drinking alcohol during pregnancy and routine screening by health care professionals to detect alcohol consumption before or at early stages pregnancy should be followed, the researchers said.

Neha Tripathi‚Äôs five-under 67 takes her to top in 9th leg of Hero WPGT,"Neha Tripathi shot her best round of the season, a stunning five-under 67, that carried her to the top of the leaderboard in the ninth leg of the Hero Women‚Äôs Professional Golf Tour 2017.

At the end of two rounds, Neha is three-under 141. Neha, who won the first leg of this season in Ahmedabad, but has not tasted victory since, is two shots clear of the consistent Gaurika Bishnoi (69) at the Prestige Golfshire.

On a day when there were numerous under-par scores, Vani Kapoor recovered lost ground with a two-under 70 that hauled her up from T-11th to Tied-5th at 147. Also moving up significantly was Amandeep Drall (71) who is Tied-7th, up from overnight 14th at 149.

Amateur Ridhima Dilawari shot a creditable round of 71 that brought her to even par 144 and third place, while overnight leader Gursimar Badwal slipped with a card of 75 and was fourth at 146.

Vani shared the fifth place with amateur Pranavi Urs (73). Amandeep Drall was Tied-7th with Siddhi Kapoor (74) and Mehar Atwal (76) dropped to ninth at 150.

Neha, starting the day in Tied-third, had a dream run on Thursday, as she cruised through the front nine in two-under with birdies on fourth and sixth holes.

On the back nine she was on a roll with four birdies in a row from 10th to 13th at which point she was six-under. Four straight pars brought her to the 18th at six-under, but she dropped her only bogey of the day at the closing hole for 67.

Gaurika Bishnoi stayed bogey free for the entire day and had three birdies on back nine on 10th, 13th and 17th holes.

Gaurika is having a great season, as she leads the Hero Order of Merit ‚Äì too, and has won once, finished second three times and twice she was third. She has never been outside Top-10 in eight starts.

Ridhima had three birdies on front nine and two bogeys on the back stretch, while Vani had three birdies, one on front nine and two on back nine, and just one bogey on par-4 eighth.

The final round will see Neha go out in the final threesome with Gaurika and Ridhima, while Pranavi, Vani and Gursimar will play in the second to last group.

Views from the Underside,"Neelam Mansingh Chowdhry Neelam Mansingh Chowdhry

If you were to leave your home in a hurry, never to return, what would you do?‚Äù Two months ago, theatre director Neelam Mansingh Chowdhry put this question before a group of actors, and watched as they churned through ideas. Lost, emotionally-violated, physically-tired and hardened protagonists crowd her new play, Dark Borders, named after an anthology of the works of the writer of the Partition, Saadat Hasan Manto, which will be staged at the India Habitat Centre on August 26 and 27.

The Chandigarh-based director accumulates experiences and sensations, from the Nirbhaya case to Bilkis Bano‚Äôs, from her visit to the Holocaust Museum to the photographs of homeless people of Syria, and ‚Äúit spills out in the rehearsal room‚Äù. Dark Borders is not a linear narrative or even a single story, but an idea of the dark spaces of the human experience communicated through sketches, fully-formed sequences, and incomplete fragments of stories of Manto and Maxim Gorky. A member of the audience may be familiar with one or all the stories and protagonists, but the intention of the play is more to make an intuitive connection about loss and hope.

‚ÄúThere was a time when I did what was called the well-made play, which had a beginning, a middle and an end. Now, when I go to rehearsals, I have no structure in my mind. The process between me and the actor is more collaborative. The stories flow in circles, loops and swirls, perhaps like the uncertainties that we are a part of in life,‚Äù says the director. Dark Borders completes a trilogy ‚Äî the previous plays, Naked Voices and Bitter Fruit, were performed with students of the National School of Drama.

When she went to the Holocaust Museum, she saw images of shoes whose ownership is unknown. Working on the idea, the actors and she created a sequence in Dark Borders, referencing Dalits who carry shoes on their heads in the presence of upper castes. Manto wrote Tamasha in response to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre but the short story now speaks to Chowdhry about ‚ÄúSyria, people running away from their homes, elders trying to protect their children and the role of a child‚Äù. ‚ÄúI would say, ‚Äòlet‚Äôs have a refugee camp, tents, people cooking‚Äô and then we see what can develop. That way, the authorship of the play is distributed,‚Äù says Chowdhry.

A scene from Dark Borders A scene from Dark Borders

A Gorky short story about poverty features in the play as an example of the director‚Äôs firm faith in humanity. ‚ÄúI am always looking for affirmation in life. No matter how dark things are, I am always looking for examples of hope. I think poverty is a great violence but, in this story, the two protagonists are scratching and snatching food but, when she finds he is collapsing, she cares for him. The world may be getting darker, but there is always a tinge of hope,‚Äù she says.

The stage is bare because the actors‚Äô bodies tell the tales (‚Äúalso because, where‚Äôs the money?‚Äù), using props limited to a bucket and a steel grid that has done duty in previous plays of the director. The costumes, unlike the previous plays of the trilogy, are dominated by browns and beiges and Chowdhry‚Äôs group of musicians will accompany live on instruments ranging from coconut shells to air-conditioner pipes.

Dark Borders, 75 minutes long, will be staged at India Habitat Centre on August 26 (7 pm) and 27 (4 pm). Tickets priced Rs 500, Rs 350 and Rs 200 are available at the Programmes Desk, Habitat World, IHC

Would you like to be matched at work?,"Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

‚ÄúI want to do fraandship with you‚Ä¶‚Äù is something every woman has heard, being randomly accosted on the road, and yes, that has now translated online, to not just Facebook and other social networking sites, but also the professional LinkedIn. While I‚Äôm usually careful about avoiding ‚Äúfriendship requests‚Äù from people I don‚Äôt know on Facebook, I‚Äôm not that reticent on LinkedIn, since it‚Äôs a site where professionals pursue career goals. But, I‚Äôve had to un-connect after receiving ‚Äúfriendship requests‚Äù in my mailbox marked to ‚ÄúMy dear‚Ä¶‚Äù.

So, when a new matrimonial app decides to pitch itself as the perfect playing ground for dating with a purpose, using the professional networking site as its database, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that it would weed out the Romeos. Promatch, playing cupid to ambitious careerists, claims to be a notch above the typical dating apps, which are used for ‚Äúflirting‚Äù and ‚Äúcasual relationships‚Äù, among other things. Promatch, on the other hand, since it has LinkedIn verified profiles, effectively points you towards mates who are (hopefully!) ‚Äúfocused towards a serious relationship‚Äù and get this‚Äîyou can search in same industry, match your incomes and city.

First off, hookups happen everywhere, whether it‚Äôs at work or elsewhere. It‚Äôs the same people, after all, whether you meet at a bar, through common friends or at work, with or without an app. Potential partners can‚Äôt grow a sincerity gene, just because you happen to be a ‚Äòpro‚Äô match. But, what‚Äôs commendable is the clear-headed approach it takes to matrimony, something Indians are famous for. While it‚Äôs fine to kiss all the frogs you like, make your ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù before you find your Prince Charming or the woman of your dreams, when it comes to marriage, there‚Äôs a very decided checklist, which puts the earning capacity of a spouse right on top. And, conventionally, parents have looked for a doctor for their doctor son or daughter and other similar matches. And, while such an app may sound like fun, it‚Äôs not really, since it‚Äôs similar to the ‚Äúbio-data‚Äù that gets sent around to relatives and all those who reach out, listing educational qualifications, even parents‚Äô and relatives‚Äô career progression, if someone is well-placed in a government job, etc. It‚Äôs all laid out, bare bones, without any pretensions. In this generation, where we act all this doesn‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre one better than our parents, such an app calls out our innate‚Ä¶well, ‚ÄúIndian-ness‚Äù. Will the guy understand my hours? Can he support me if I take a break after a baby? Will the woman be able to equally pitch in for my dream home EMIs? Well, let‚Äôs face it, we‚Äôre like that only. Or a lot of us still are.

Matching incomes is not a bad thing, ideally. I remember, when a friend‚Äôs marriage was breaking up, one of the things was that rankled was their approach to money. While she was middle-class in her thinking, putting off the lights and fans whenever she left a room or haggled with auto-wallahs, the guy was beyond such cares. On a daily basis, such things can blow up into something huge. So yes, coming from a similar income bracket isn‚Äôt such a bad idea. Same industry? What about all the gossip that follows if you break up? And, what about all your dark secrets that can be laid bare through common contacts? In other words, just like when you apply for a job, it‚Äôs easy to do a background check! So, it‚Äôs time to hold back on the drinks at office parties‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt want that making it to your profile!

But, while a friend I checked with, said she didn‚Äôt mind giving it a try, some others question the concept of getting matched with a ‚Äúpro‚Äù. ‚ÄúI would much rather go with the flow,‚Äù one guy said, adding ‚ÄúWhat my partner does is not really the question. It‚Äôs the person that‚Äôs important.‚Äù Another, in his early twenties, who loves video games was thrilled with the idea of maybe finding someone from the gaming industry, so they could literally play together. However, he added sagely, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs for people who care about the ‚Äòstatus‚Äô of their spouse‚Ä¶who feel the need to show off, perhaps.‚Äù

Well, how about doing it the old-fashioned way? Whether you swipe right or left on Tinder if you find someone hot (or not), or check out their incomes, don‚Äôt lose focus on the real thing‚Äîfinding a partner who understands you, not just your cranky boss and working hours, though that can be a good start. So, go ahead, log on! Finding the right someone never sounded as easy‚Ä¶.or tough! Love will remain tricky, and messy, wherever you chance upon it.

"Spinning track alone won‚Äôt win Australia Test, says Tamim Iqbal","Tamim Iqbal will open batting for Bangladesh. (Source: AP) Tamim Iqbal will open batting for Bangladesh. (Source: AP)

Bangladesh is set to take on Australia in a two-match Test series that is scheduled to start from Sunday. The opening batsman of the home side Tamim Iqbal has said that it‚Äôs not only that would help their side win the game.‚ÄùIt is not that we will win just by making spin tracks,‚Äù Tamim told.

Adding more to it, the left-handed batsman suggested that the efforts from hosts‚Äô bowling line up will play a key role in their success.

‚ÄúEven if there is support for the spinners in the wicket, still our spinners will have to bowl really well,‚Äù he added.

Moreover, Tamim insisted that it needs team effort to create fruitful results.‚ÄùOur batsmen also have to bat well as well as our pacers, who need to bowl well in these surfaces. If you want to see success then all these things have to work together,‚Äù he said.

The Bangladesh team selection recently had a lot of confusion when batsman Mominul Haque was dropped from the squad but was re-called.

‚ÄúMominul is added into the squad of the first test, replacing Mosaddek Hossain,‚Äù BCB president Nazmul Hassan. ‚Äú(Hossain) is not cleared from his eye infection. So we can‚Äôt risk him,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAs a coach, you have a responsibility,‚Äù Hathurusinghe said. ‚ÄúBut the player also knows what he has to do. They are working very hard on it. ‚ÄúSomebody is going to go out of the team when they are not performing. Those players not in the squad, they are still practicing. Confidence comes when we communicate with the player. There is no rule but fairness is applied for everybody,‚Äù he added.

Squad: Mushfiqur Rahim (capt & wk), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Liton Das, Soumya Sarkar, Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Mustafizur Rahman, Taijul Islam, Mehedi Hasan, Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, Nasir Hossain, Shafiul Islam

The Dark Tower: Things you should know about the Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey starrer,"The Dark Tower, directed by Danish filmmaker Nikolaj Arcel, is based on American horror writer Stephen King's eight book fantasy-horror series of the same name. Think Game of Thrones in western setting instead of medieval, only with more scope and scale but far fewer characters. The film stars Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey as the forces of good and evil, respectively. Although the film has already released on August 4 in the United States, in India it is going to be released on August 25. (Source: Photo by Sony Pictures)

The primary character in the saga is Roland Deschain, the last among the gunslingers, portrayed by Idris Elba. Gunslingers in the world of The Dark Tower were Arthurian warriors without armour and toting guns instead of swords. (Source: Photo by Sony Pictures)

The villain of The Dark Tower is The Man in Black. He is a dark wizard, and is a worthy opponent to Roland. The character is portrayed by Matthew McConaughey (Source: Photo by Sony Pictures)

Sandwiched between Roland Deschain and The Man in Black is Jake Chambers, a boy who belongs to our own world and serves as our perspective to the dying and desolate world of Roland Deschain (Source: Photo by Sony Pictures)

Roland Deschain is following The Man in Black, and you'll know the true meaning of relentlessness only if you understand the zeal of the gunslinger. Roland will never stop chasing The Man in Black, even if the chase killed him. (Source: Photo by Sony Pictures)

Why is Roland chasing his nemesis? Because The Man in Black wants to bring down the Dark Tower. If the Dark Tower goes down, all existence, all reality, all world would be obliterated. (Source: Photo by Sony Pictures)

The Dark Tower is a towering (sorry!) structure where Roland Deschain's quest is slowly, but inexorable taking him. It stands at the nexus of everything - literally, everything. Without it, there is absolutely nothing. (Source: Photo by Sony Pictures)

: Jake Chambers somehow gets into the world of Roland Deschain and becomes his companion. Roland's world is not like ours. His world is infested with monsters and precious little life exists beyond old men and scrub. (Source: Photo by Sony Pictures)

In the book, Jake Chambers is not Roland's only companion. There is a couple - Eddie and Susannah Dean. They are not there in the film, but reports have suggested they might appear in spinoffs. (Source: Photo by Sony Pictures)"

MFs want Nandan Nilekani back at Infosys in ‚Äòsuitable capacity‚Äô,"Proxy firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services India has also supported the idea of bringing Nilekani back into the company. Proxy firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services India has also supported the idea of bringing Nilekani back into the company.

Domestic institutions, led by some of the top mutual funds in the country, have sought the return of former Infosys managing director and CEO Nandan Nilekani in a ‚Äúsuitable capacity‚Äù to restore the confidence of stakeholders in the tech company. Infosys shares, which were battered by close to 14 per cent in two days after CEO Vishal Sikka resigned on Thursday, staged a mild recovery of 1.98 per cent to Rs 894.50 on the BSE on Wednesday.

In a letter to the board of Infosys, CEOs of mutual funds said, ‚Äúafter considerable thought and mutual deliberations, we strongly feel that the board of Infosys should invite Nandan Nilekani to join the board in a suitable capacity.‚Äù Mutual funds hold nearly 9 per cent stake in Infosys. Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), the single largest shareholder of Infosys, holds around 7 per cent in the company.

‚ÄúIn our opinion, he enjoys the confidence of various stakeholders viz, customers, shareholders and employees. Given his credentials, we feel, that his joining the board at this stage, will restore confidence of stakeholders in the company and also facilitate resolution of the contentious issues that Infosys is facing presently,‚Äù they said. Mutual funds used to hold a higher stake in the company but they reduced their exposure in the wake of slowdown in the tech sector in the one year.

However, LIC sources said the institution has not taken any stand on the issue. The biggest financial institution was reportedly buying the stock when it was hammered recently.

Proxy firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services India has also supported the idea of bringing Nilekani back into the company. ‚ÄúInfosys‚Äô board has attempted to play the hand it has been dealt, but has been unable to protect its CEO. It has one more hand to play in selecting a successor, but to play it right, it must begin by reinventing itself. It must convince Nandan Nilekani to join the board once again, as its non-executive chairperson,‚Äù IiAS said.

It says Nilekani is possibly the very best candidate Infosys can find globally. ‚ÄúHe has kept pace with technology advances, has been instrumental in digitalizing the country, and is well-networked with the bureaucracy and global leaders. He also has skin in the game: having started with Infosys early in its journey, Nandan Nilekani will intuitively understand the corporate culture, and as such also have ‚Äòmatching of minds‚Äô with some of Infosys‚Äô founders. He is best-positioned to shepherd the company as it finds a successor and reinvents itself. And, he possesses the stature to bring an end to the public discourse,‚Äù it said.

After Vishal Sikka‚Äôs appointment on the Infosys board, the company has had one extra-ordinary general meeting (in which Sikka was appointed), three annual general meetings and has approached shareholders five times through a postal ballot. However, not all founders vote on all resolutions suggesting that they are in not always in sync with each other. Therefore, one could well conclude that not all promoters share Narayana Murthy‚Äôs concerns or even support his public criticism of the company and its board.

Former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan has backed founder and former chairman NR Narayana Murthy in the ongoing tussle between Murthy and the board. The Infosys saga started in February 2017 when Murthy and former Infosys directors TV Mohandas Pai and V Balakrishnan demanded that the Chairman R Seshasayee step down over alleged governance and disclosure issues. The founders of Infosys who hold over 12.75 per cent stake in the company had then sent a letter to the board raising several concerns.

Later both Sikka and Seshasayee clarified their position. However, Murthy was yet to withdraw his February statement on concerns over governance and disclosure issues. Infosys then conducted an investigation with the help of external agencies which included Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, Control Risks and Khaitan & Company. As disclosed in June 2017, the summary of the report had said, ‚ÄúWe found no evidence whatsoever to support any of the new allegations in the complaints regarding wrongdoing by the company or its directors and employees, and those allegations were rebutted by substantial and credible evidence.‚Äù

Despite charges that founders were interfering in its affairs, Murthy came down heavily on the decision of the Infosys management to offer a big salary hike to chief operating officer Pravin Rao ‚Äî who is now the interim CEO ‚Äî indicating his continuing rift between the management led by Seshasayee and Sikka.

This was followed by anonymous complaints which alleged that there were irregularities in connection with company‚Äôs acquisitions of Panaya and Skava in 2015. It had also alleged that the mergers and acquisitions team had acted without securing proper approvals. There were also allegations that Sikka had received inappropriate compensation and incurred excessive expenses relating to travel, security and the Palo Alto office.

Murthy had also asked the company‚Äôs board to make public, the contents of the report that probed into alleged irregularities involving certain key acquisitions. Infosys, however, refused stating that the company does not want to make the report public.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (R), together with Japan‚Äôs Foreign Minister Taro Kono (L), holds a news conference after their U.S.-Japan Security talks at the State Department in Washington, U.S., August 17, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

North Korea and the United States clashed at a UN forum on Tuesday over their military intentions towards one another, with Pyongyang‚Äôs envoy declaring it would ‚Äúnever‚Äù put its nuclear deterrent on the negotiating table. Japan, well within reach of North Korea‚Äôs missiles, said the world must maintain pressure on the reclusive country to rein in its nuclear and missile programmes and now was not the time for a resumption of multi-party talks.

North Korea has pursued its weapons programmes in defiance of UN Security Council sanctions and ignored all calls, including from major ally China, to stop, prompting a bellicose exchange of rhetoric between the North and the United States. North Korea justifies its weapons programmes, including its recent threat to fire missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam, by pointing to perceived US hostility, such as military exercises with South Korea this week.

US disarmament ambassador Robert Wood told a UN-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva US President Donald Trump‚Äôs top priority was to protect the United States and its allies against the ‚Äúgrowing threat‚Äù from North Korea and America was ready to use ‚Äúthe full range of capabilities‚Äù at its disposal. The ‚Äúpath to dialogue still remained an option‚Äù for Pyongyang and it had the choice between poverty and belligerence on the one hand and prosperity and acceptance.

North Korea‚Äôs envoy told the same forum the North‚Äôs nuclear deterrent would never be up for negotiation, echoing Pyongyang‚Äôs regular denunciation of US ‚Äúaggression‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe measures taken by the DPRK to strengthen its nuclear deterrence and develop inter-continental rockets is justifiable and a legitimate option for self-defence in the face of such apparent and real threats,‚Äù diplomat Ju Yong Chol told the forum, referring to ‚Äúconstant nuclear threats‚Äù by the United States.

DPRK stands for the North‚Äôs official name, the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea. Regarding joint US-South Korean military exercises that began on Monday, he warned: ‚ÄúThe ongoing military adventure would certainly add gasoline to the fire, driving the current tense situation to further deterioration.‚Äù

Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said pressure must be maintained until the North demonstrated it would give up its nuclear programme. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the time to discuss (the resumption of) six-party talks,‚Äù Kono said, referring to stalled negotiations involving both Koreas, the United States, Russia, China and Japan. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to exert pressure,‚Äù he told reporters.

‚ÄòCRAZY‚Äô TO SHARE TIMELINE

The head of the US military‚Äôs Pacific Command said diplomacy was key. Admiral Harry Harris was in South Korea to observe annual joint military drills with the South Korean military, which the North called a step towards nuclear conflict masterminded by ‚Äúwar maniacs‚Äù. ‚ÄúSo we hope and we work for diplomatic solutions to the challenge presented by Kim Jong Un,‚Äù Harris told reporters at a US air base in Osan, about an hour from Seoul, referring to the North Korean leader.

He said diplomacy was ‚Äúthe most important starting point‚Äù in response to the North‚Äôs threat, when asked what actions by North Korea might trigger a preemptive US strike against it. ‚ÄúAs far as a timeline, it would be crazy for me to share with you those tripwires in advance. If we did that, it would hardly be a military strategy,‚Äù he said.

The United States and South Korea began the long-planned exercises on Monday, called the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which the allies have said are purely defensive. The drills involve tens of thousands of troops as well as computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea.

The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with the North because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Delegations from about 20 countries spoke at the four-hour UN session, including Britain, France, Australia and South Korea, all of which criticised North Korea.

‚ÄúI would like to repeat the appeal to the DPRK to listen to the fact that there is no alternative to stopping the different provocations and to return to dialogue,‚Äù South Korean ambassador Kim Inchul said. ‚ÄúWe have never threatened the DPRK with any attacks and we have never promoted the use of force.‚Äù

"Two Warring AIADMK Factions Finally ‚ÄòUnited‚Äô, Panneerselvam To Be Deputy CM","After several failed attempts, the much-awaited merger of the two warring factions of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) was announced on Monday afternoon. The union wasn‚Äôt without the drama that has characterized events of the past several months.

At the last minute, former chief minister O. Panneerselvam and chief minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami (the OPS and the EPS who have hogged headline space for weeks) disagreed over the ouster of the party general secretary V.K. Sasikala before arriving at a compromise."
India vs Sri Lanka: No more national anthems before remaining ODIs,"The series between India and Sri Lanka will no longer witness the two teams singing their respective national anthems in the remaining ODI‚Äôs. (Source: PTI) The series between India and Sri Lanka will no longer witness the two teams singing their respective national anthems in the remaining ODI‚Äôs. (Source: PTI)

The India vs Sri Lanka one-day series will no longer witness the practice of, two teams, singing their respective national anthems. However, the first T20 encounter between the two will once again see the two teams recite their anthems. The latest development was confirmed by Sri Lanka cricket team‚Äôs media manager Dinesh Ratnasingham.

‚ÄúWe have adopted the practice of singing National Anthem only at the beginning of each format of the game‚Äù, Dinesh Ratnasingham said while speaking to pakobserver.com.

‚ÄúThe practice of singing National Anthem was followed in the first ODI (on Sunday at Dambulla) and again it will be sung at the R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo before the commencement of the only T-20 match (6th September) on this tour. Rest of the venues will have the immediate start of the match without the Anthem Ceremony‚Äù, he added.

It may be recalled here that in the first ODI, both India and Sri Lanka had sung their national teams. But henceforth, with the adoption of this measure, national anthems will only be sung in the first ODI of the series.

Meanwhile, in the first ODI, India registered a thumping win over Sri Lanka by 9 wickets. Axar Patel picked up three wickets to restrict the hosts for a mere 216. However, Shikhar Dhawan stole the show with a brilliant unbeaten 132 of just 90 deliveries. He was ably supported by skipper Virat Kohli who scored 82 of just 70 balls. Together they forged a partnership of 197 which is the second highest stand for India against Sri Lanka. It was also India‚Äôs biggest win in terms of balls to spare.

Technology and the law: SC verdict on right to privacy is a major relief,"In this May 16, 2012 file photo, an operator helps an elderly woman scan her fingerprints as she enrolls for Aadhar, the unique identification project, in Kolkata. (Source: AP Photo/File) In this May 16, 2012 file photo, an operator helps an elderly woman scan her fingerprints as she enrolls for Aadhar, the unique identification project, in Kolkata. (Source: AP Photo/File)

The highest constitutional court has today cleared all doubts as to whether privacy is a fundamental right under Indian Constitution. The question of privacy is obviously an important one in this era when information technology, broadly called, is not only punctuating but are virtually taking over our lives. Technology has made a many hitherto impossible things possible, and has many improbable things certain and many processes more efficient ‚Äì and in many cases so advanced that ‚Äúit is indistinguishable from magic,‚Äù as the British science-fiction writer, Arthur C. Clarke put it. The methods by which a person‚Äôs legal rights may be infringed have also undergone a similar transformation. Infringments of privacy therefore by state and non-state actors has come to be a real danger of our contemporary times and it required a strong articulation as a fundamental right and it is a major relief that it has come from the Supreme Court.

Other than privacy, there are other legal problems that arise with increase of use of technology. For instance, the increasing use of technology and algorithms for decision making. In Aadhaar, the use of proprietary biometric matching algorithms to determine substantive legal status of identity is one such example. Can a state authority delegate such essential function of decision making that determine and affect rights of other parties to the device of technology? If so, what would be the parameters to make sure it is just and not arbitrary? Merely because it is technology, would there be a legal presumption against arbitrariness? If so, would such a presumption be rebuttable or irrebuttable? If such a presumption is rebuttable, how can one go about rebutting such a presumption? Similarly can it be presumed to be non-discriminatory?

We have seen instances for example where facial recognition algorithms that appear to work better for caucasian faces, but not so for coloured faces. Given the asymmetry of information on the working of the technology ‚Äì where in most cases, the algorithm developer and the technology provider know obviously more about the working of the technical system than person‚Äôs whose interests are affected by it, on who should the burden of proof lie if there is a question of either arbitrariness or discrimination in the working of the algorithm? If every technology assisted decision making must be provably non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory, what standard of proof is an acceptable standard of proof for various applications?

Even if we were to assume that technology may not be used as the final word and it may only be technology assisted human decision making, say, in the matter of criminal sentencing where a predictive algorithm is used to determine the appropriate sentence, what would be the legal principles in dealing with the bias that such a technical assistance provides to the final deciding authority? This is by no means an exhaustive list.

It must therefore be borne in mind that technology gives a sense of benevolent determinism to many of our life‚Äôs problems, which may turn out to be false many a time. As methods of incursion into our rights become more sophisticated, so should our means of asserting them and warding off such incursions, by demanding a more robust standard of the technology in question having to be provably rights- preserving.

AFC Cup: Bengaluru FC thrash North Korean side April 25 3-0,"Bengaluru FC Sunil Chettri and 4.25 SC North Korea players in action during the AFC cup Inter Zone Semifinal match. (Source: PTI) Bengaluru FC Sunil Chettri and 4.25 SC North Korea players in action during the AFC cup Inter Zone Semifinal match. (Source: PTI)

Star striker Sunil Chhetri was among the goal-getters as Bengaluru FC thrased North Korean side April 25 3-0 in first of the two-legged AFC Cup inter-zone semifinal match in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

Chhetri led the charge with a 32nd minute strike before Udanta Singh and Lenny Rodrigues found the target in the 51st and 78th minutes to help Bengaluru register an emphatic win in the rain-hit match in front of the cheering home crowd at Sree Kanteerava Stadium.

Heavy rains lashed the stadium an hour into the game and both the teams played under reduced visibility.

Chhetri broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute by converting a penalty kick after Udanta was brought down by the North Korean goalkeeper Ri Kang inside the area.

Chhetri stepped up and sent his shot at the center, which beat Ri Kang, who dived to his right.

Bengaluru scored their second goal through Udanta as the winger sprinted from the vacant right flank into the box and sent a superb left footer into the North Korean net.

Lenny Rodrigues completed the route as he sent the ball past Kang who was blinded by the splash of water on his face. Chhetri broke away and ran almost 50 yards to cut in and deliver the cross from the left to Lenny who made no mistake.

Chhetri missed a chance to score his second goal in the 42nd minute after Kang, who was off the line, managed to get a finger of a the Indian striker‚Äôs shot for a corner.

April 25 also had their chance in 23rd minute as Ri Hyong Jin sent an accurate freekick but An Song Il‚Äôs header hit the crossbar and the ball rebounded back into play.

They also missed an opportunity coming their way to reduce the margin in the 71st minute as Kwon Ch sent a grounded cross but An Il Bom could not connect it properly.

We will never stop having special nights at the Fortress. I said it before and will always say it,this is BFC. Our fans? Priceless. ‚Äî Sunil Chhetri (@chetrisunil11) 23 August 2017

What a night! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better debut than this for @bengalurufc , Thank you @WestBlockBlues for making this night special. ‚Äî Gurpreet Singh (@GurpreetGK) 23 August 2017

Soon after the half-time break, April 25 got into their act, but the smartness of the Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saved the situation. Kim Yu Song had beaten three Bengaluru men and was going for a shot from an angle into the goal in 49th minute but Sandhu denied him.

A couple of minutes back too, Gurpreet had done well to send the ball out of danger after Kim Jong Chol had flicked to An Il Bom, who sent a cross across the goal with all the defenders falling short of pace to get hold of it.

Bengaluru FC will now travel to Pyongyang on September 13 for the second leg match.

"India vs Sri Lanka: Akila Danajaya puts India in a fix, picks six wickets","Akila Danajaya returned with figures of 6/54 in 10 overs. (Source: PTI) Akila Danajaya returned with figures of 6/54 in 10 overs. (Source: PTI)

India won the second of the five-match ODI series by 3 wickets against Sri Lanka in Kandy as MS Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar Kumar rescued the visitors after they were reduced to 131/7 while chasing 231 in 47 overs.

Earlier, India were off to a flying start to their chase by the openers Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan. The left-right batting combination notched up a total of 109 runs at Pallekele in second ODI of the five-match series.

Chasing the modest target, Rohit ended his run-drought in Sri Lanka to score a half-century while Dhawan continued his incredible run on the tour to score 49. With the kind of batting display that was being put forward by the Indian openers, Sri Lanka captain introduced spinner Akila Dananjaya and the leggie didn‚Äôt disappoint his skipper.

Dananjaya provided the hosts with their first breakthrough after trapping Sharma in front of the stumps for 54. The right-handed batsman did ask to review the on-field decision but it didn‚Äôt change the umpire‚Äôs call.

Dhawan‚Äôs stay at the crease after Sharma‚Äôs dismissal became a brief one as he too departed for 49 after Mathews took a blinder off Siriwardana. India were now 113/2. But the real drama began in the 18th over as Dananjaya picked three wickets in that over.

He continued with his leg spin and the right-hander cleaned up Kedar Jadhav for 1 on the very first delivery of the over. Indian captain Virat Kohli came in at number 5 but had a disappointing and a brief stay at the crease. He scored a boundary of the first ball that he played but failed to read a wrong-un only to get bowled by the right-handed bowler. Dananjaya now had a total of four wickets under his belt.

The third wicket of the over came in the form of KL Rahul who was dismissed in the same fashion as his skipper. Dananjaya broke his defense to dismantle the wood work behind him. The leggie‚Äôs sixth wicket came when Hardik Pandya danced down the track but missed the delivery and was stumped by Niroshan Dickwella without opening the scoring.

Dananjaya bagged a total of six wickets in 10 overs at the cost of 54 runs in Kandy.

"I tried to start with attack because it is my defence, says Shahid Afridi","Shahid Afridi scored his first T20 century during NatWest T20 match. (Source:ecb.co.uk.tv) Shahid Afridi scored his first T20 century during NatWest T20 match. (Source:ecb.co.uk.tv)

After slamming a 42-ball century Hampshire opener Shahid Afridi has revealed that the gamble to open the innings had paid off and one of the reasons behind his brilliant knock was his risk-taking ability.

Speaking to Cricinfo, Afridi said, ‚ÄúI asked the captain and coach yesterday if I could bat higher up the order because seven or eight is not my position. In crucial games you have to take chances. The first six overs are important and you need batters who play aggressively like me to utilise this.

‚ÄúI wanted to put pressure on them from the start although it was not easy because the new ball was seaming. The first six overs are important and I tried to start on the attack. ‚ÄúI tried to start with attack ‚Äì attack is your defence,‚Äù Afridi, who had not opened a T20 innings since 2011 Finals Day, told BBC Radio Solent.

Recalling the last instance when he opened for the county side, Afridi said,‚ÄùThe last time I opened the batting for Hampshire was finals day in 2011 but the main thing is confidence and I felt confident today.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Wayne Madsen, who dropped Afridi‚Äôs catch on 65, recalled the moment and said, ‚ÄúI saw it all the way and I thought it was coming straight in, to be fair,‚Äù Madsen said, having manfully agreed to front up and discuss the moment. I would probably catch those 98 times out of 100. It was just one of those things, it just hit me straight in the middle of the hand and popped right out again. He had already done us quite a lot of damage but that cost us another 40 runs and it was very disappointing obviously.‚Äù

Sri Lanka‚Äôs transition gospel: Learn it from Virat Kohli and Co.,"Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli took India cruising past the winning line in the first ODI. (Source: PTI) Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli took India cruising past the winning line in the first ODI. (Source: PTI)

Down and out, Sri Lanka have turned to India to manage transition and ensure revival. According to a Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) source, an informal discussion already happened at the board level on the sidelines of the Asian Cricket Council meeting in Colombo earlier this month. Now Virat Kohli has said he expects a conversation to happen between the two teams at the end of the ongoing tour.

Sri Lanka haven‚Äôt won a bilateral ODI series against a higher-ranked team since 2015. They have lost 12 of their last 16 ODIs, including a home series against Zimbabwe this year. ‚ÄúThose things (interaction between the two teams) may happen after the competitive zone is over and (we are) done with the series. I think that will happen after the 6th, if it has to happen from their end I presume. But look it is difficult for any team going through transition. The interaction I presume will happen after the tour,‚Äù Kohli said. Before that Sri Lanka coach Nic Pothas had said: ‚ÄúWe are in a position at the moment that England, India, Australia all have found themselves in. We have learnt from them and spoken to them‚Ä¶‚Äù

Kohli gave a low-down of the turnaround. ‚ÄúOne thing that we decided to do as a team was (to) take more responsibility and ownership of what we do on the field, playing for the country. We just needed to change our mindset. It didn‚Äôt matter if we were playing against a side that has played 60 Tests each, if we are mentally more prepared than them, then we are in a better position to win,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSo we decided to put our heads in that zone where experience didn‚Äôt matter much for us. It was the fight and competitiveness we were willing to show and the desire to fight for longer periods that helped us get through that phase quicker than what others might‚Äôve faced,‚Äù he added. To be fair to Sri Lanka, they lost Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan over the last two years.

"As China‚Äôs appetite for steak grows, Beijing ends its beef with imports","After years of lobbying, the United States succeeded in getting the curbs lifted in June, ending a 14-year ban triggered by a case of mad-cow disease in Washington state. After years of lobbying, the United States succeeded in getting the curbs lifted in June, ending a 14-year ban triggered by a case of mad-cow disease in Washington state.

China, the world‚Äôs top meat market, is loosening longstanding restrictions on beef imports from major suppliers to feed the appetite of the country‚Äôs growing middle class for steaks and ribs.

Over the past few decades, Beijing banned imports of beef from European countries and the United States during outbreaks of mad cow disease. Worries about the disease are subsiding following more stringent inspections on foreign arrivals, while Chinese people are seeking healthier sources of protein and adopting more Western eating habits.

Beef is now the fastest-growing meat in China, outstripping stagnant demand for more widely eaten pork as consumers look to reduce fat in their diets.

But supplies are unlikely to keep up with demand given the high cost of raising cattle in China, prompting the government to rethink its import restrictions.

After years of lobbying, the United States succeeded in getting the curbs lifted in June, ending a 14-year ban triggered by a case of mad-cow disease in Washington state.

China also gave the greenlight for beef from South Africa and Ireland earlier this year, and on Tuesday said it is considering bringing in beef from Namibia.

China‚Äôs beef purchases have soared in recent years, eclipsing Europe, South Korea and Japan since 2012.

Last year, it became the world‚Äôs second-largest importer of beef after the United States, bringing in more than 800,000 tonnes worth $2.6 billion. That compares with just 6,000 tonnes in 2006. ‚ÄúDomestic supplies cannot catch up with the rising demand. There is not enough premium beef, either. And there are some food safety concerns in China,‚Äù said Pan Chengjun, executive director of food and agriculture research at Rabobank in Hong Kong.

It‚Äôs a victory for cattle ranchers locked out of the world‚Äôs top market, but the increased competition from opening up the market may unsettle current top suppliers, Australia, Brazil and Argentina.

The latest steps come as Beijing aims to tighten imports of other commodities, sugar and broiler chicken, in a bid to boost the domestic industry. China‚Äôs beef and veal consumption has risen more than 10 percent over the past five years, while consumption of chicken and pork has actually declined in recent years.

Beef demand is expected to rise past 8 million tonnes this year, according to estimates by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but domestic production is not rising at the same pace, hovering around 7 million tonnes.

Zhang Jianjun, purchasing manager with Sino-Australia Top Beef (Beijing) Co Ltd, a company that mainly imports beef from Australia, expected demand to rise by 10-15 percent in the next few years.

‚ÄúIn the meantime, it is getting more expensive to raise cattle,‚Äù he said. Cattle take longer to mature and farming requires large amounts of land, but China‚Äôs rapid urbanisation over the past decade has reduced the availability of quality grassland.

Even for companies that turn to intensive farming, which can attract government subsidies, beef production remains expensive and domestic beef retails at well above international levels.

The average beef price in China is currently around 54 yuan ($8.11) per kg, more than twice the price of U.S. beef. ‚ÄúThe potential demand for beef is huge here in China ‚Ä¶ if foreign beef comes to China at current prices, demand will grow a lot,‚Äù said Pan.

Iran, accused of supporting Shiite Huthi rebels in Yemen, ‚Äúis part of the problem, not the solution‚Äù when it comes to ending conflict in the war-torn nation, Yemen‚Äôs top diplomat has said.

‚ÄúIran is the cause of the problem, Iran continues to support the Huthis, Iranian arms are smuggled.

‚ÄúIran has no role to play in the region,‚Äù echoed the Saudi ambassador to the United Nations, Abdallah Al-Mouallimi.

"US media dishonest, lobbying tool: Donald Trump","U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

President Donald Trump called a majority of the mainstream American media dishonest, bad and a ‚Äúlobbying tool‚Äù for allegedly giving a platform to hate groups after the violence at a white supremacist rally in Virginia. Trump, whose controversial remarks after the violence in Charlottesville on August 12 drew widespread criticism, said most of the media was propagating incorrect information about him and fomenting divisions in the United States.

Trump had earlier said that ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù were to blame for the clashes. But he changed course after severe backlash and said there was no room for prejudice, bigotry and hate. At a campaign-style rally on Wednesday in Phoenix, Arizona, Trump singled out popular media organisations like The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN for his criticism. He, however, praised Fox News for its coverage of his presidency. ‚ÄúFor the most part honestly, these are really, really dishonest people, they‚Äôre bad people,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI really think they don‚Äôt like our country, I really believe that.‚Äù

He claimed The Times apologised to him after he won the November election and called The Post ‚Äúa lobbying tool for Amazon‚Äù. ‚ÄúOr CNN, which is so bad and so pathetic, and their ratings are going down,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThey are trying to take away our history and our heritage, you see that,‚Äù he said in an apparent reference to the removal of monuments of Confederate generals following the the death of a woman during clashes among hundreds of white supremacists and counter protesters in Charlottesville. ‚ÄúThe only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself and the fake news,‚Äù he said and added that had it not been for the social media, where he is very active, he would not have been in the White House.

The media ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want to make our country great again,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey have double standards. You never heard them say that. And in fact, if you use the term you‚Äôd get criticised. But with me, they wanted me to say it, and I said it. And I said it very clearly, but they refused to put it on,‚Äù he said.

Trump also alleged that the mainstream media ‚Äúturns a blind eye to the gang violence on our streets, the failures of our public school, the destruction of our wealth at the hands of the terrible, terrible trade deals made by politicians that should have never been allowed to be politicians.‚Äù

US navy pauses operations after 10 sailors lost in collision,"The Guided-missile destroyer USS John S.

McCain (DDG 56) is moored pier side at Changi naval base in Singapore following a collision with the merchant vessel Alnic MC Monday, Aug. 21, 2017. (Grady T. Fontana/U.S. Navy photo via AP)

The US Navy declared a worldwide pause in its operations after the latest in a series of accidents left ten sailors missing and five injured. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson ordered an ‚Äúoperational pause‚Äù to allow a ‚Äúcomprehensive review‚Äù of practices after the destroyer USS John McCain was hit by a merchant tanker off Singapore.

‚ÄúAs you know this is the second collision in three months and the last of a series of incidents in the Pacific theater,‚Äù Richardson said.

‚ÄúThis trend demands more forceful action. As such I have directed an operational pause be taken in all of our fleets around the world.‚Äù

US Defense Secretary James Mattis, on a visit to Jordan, said Richardson‚Äôs ‚Äúbroader enquiry will look at all related accidents, incidents at sea, that sort of thing. He is going to look at all factors, not just the immediate one.‚Äù

There was no official word on how long the disruption to the world‚Äôs most powerful navy, active in all of the world‚Äôs oceans, might last. But some US media suggested the pause would last for a day.

Ten US sailors were still missing after the John McCain collided with a tanker today, tearing a large hole in its hull in the second accident involving an American warship in two months.

The badly damaged destroyer limped into port in the city-state of Singapore in the afternoon under escort after the dramatic pre-dawn accident, which sent water flooding into the vessel.

A major search involving ships and aircraft from three countries was launched for the missing sailors after the McCain hit the Alnic MC in the busy shipping lanes of the Singapore Strait, near the Strait of Malacca.

Analysts said the accident, so soon after June‚Äôs collision off Japan involving a US warship, raised questions about whether the US Navy was overstretched in Asia as it seeks to combat Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea and North Korea‚Äôs nuclear ambitions.

The US Navy said there was ‚Äúsignificant damage to the hull‚Äù of the warship in the latest collision, which led to flooding of crew sleeping areas, machinery and communications rooms.

‚ÄúDamage control efforts by the crew halted further flooding,‚Äù they said in a statement after the John S. McCain arrived at Changi Naval Base in the city-state.

A helicopter took four of the injured to a Singapore hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening while the fifth did not need further medical attention, the navy said.

The 505-foot (154-meter) vessel could still sail under its own power after the collision at 5:24 am (2124 GMT Sunday) with the Liberian-flagged tanker, which was slightly bigger at 600 feet. Two other vessels escorted it into port, AFP journalists saw.

The warship had been heading for a routine stop in Singapore after carrying out a ‚Äúfreedom of navigation operation‚Äù in the disputed South China Sea earlier in August around a reef in the Spratly Islands, sparking a furious response from Beijing.

The vessel is named after US Senator John McCain‚Äôs father and grandfather, who were both admirals in the US navy.

McCain himself, who as a naval pilot was shot down during the Vietnam War and held prisoner, welcomed the review.

‚ÄúI agree with Admiral Richardson that more forceful action is urgently needed to identify and correct the causes of the recent ship collisions,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI expect full transparency and accountability from the Navy leaders as they conduct the associated investigations and reviews.‚Äù

President Donald Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúThoughts & prayers are w/ our @USNavy sailors aboard the #USSJohnMcCain where search & rescue efforts are underway.‚Äù

Ridzwan Rahmat, a naval expert at Janes by IHS Markit, said initial indications suggested the US warship may not have been obeying rules designed to separate maritime traffic passing through the Singapore Strait.

With the accident coming soon after the freedom of navigation operation, he told AFP that it raised questions ‚Äúwhether there is crew fatigue setting in, whether or not the tempo of operations by the US Navy in this region is getting too fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre they doing too much within this region with North Korea, and Japan and then now in the South China Sea?‚Äù

Singapore, Malaysia and US ships and aircraft were all involved in the hunt for the missing sailors.

The tanker involved in the collision, which was used for transporting oil and chemicals and weighed over 30,000 gross tonnes, sustained some damage but no crew were injured, and Singapore said there was no oil pollution.

In June, seven American sailors died when the destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-flagged cargo ship in a busy channel not far from Yokosuka, a gateway to container ports in Tokyo and nearby Yokohama.

The dead sailors, aged 19 to 37, were found by divers in flooded sleeping berths a day after the collision tore a huge gash in the side of the Fitzgerald.

A senior admiral announced last week that the commander of the destroyer and several other officers had been relieved of their duties aboard their ship over the incident.

Both the USS John S. McCain and USS Fitzgerald are part of the US Seventh Fleet based in Yokosuka.

US puts more pressure on Pakistan to help with Afghan war,"President Donald Trump (Reuters) President Donald Trump (Reuters)

The United States put more pressure on Pakistan on Tuesday to help it with the war in Afghanistan, suggesting it could downgrade Islamabad‚Äôs status as a major non-NATO ally if it does not crack down on Islamist militants. A day after President Donald Trump singled out Pakistan for harboring Afghan Taliban insurgents and other militants, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington‚Äôs relationship with Pakistan would depend on its help against terrorism. ‚ÄúWe are going to be conditioning our support for Pakistan and our relationship with them on them delivering results in this area,‚Äù Tillerson told reporters. U.S. officials are frustrated by what they term Pakistan‚Äôs unwillingness to act against groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. Pakistan denies that it harbors militants fighting U.S. and Afghan government forces in Afghanistan.

Tillerson said the United States could consider withdrawing Pakistan‚Äôs status as a major non-NATO ally if cooperation did not improve. ‚ÄúWe have some leverage that‚Äôs been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them, their status as non-NATO alliance partner ‚Äì all of that can be put on the table,‚Äù he said. In a televised address on Monday about America‚Äôs involvement in Afghanistan, Trump pointed to Pakistan as offering safe haven to militants in Afghanistan, which the United States invaded in 2001.

Successive U.S. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear-armed Pakistan, which has a long porous border with Afghanistan. Washington fumes about inaction against the Taliban, but Pakistan has cooperated closely with Washington on other counterterrorism efforts, including against al Qaeda and Islamic State militants. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it was ‚Äúdisappointing that the US policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation‚Äù in the fight against terrorism.

‚ÄúAs a matter of policy, Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country,‚Äù it said. A senior U.S. administration official said on Tuesday that significant measures were under consideration, including possibly sanctioning Pakistani officials with ties to extremist organizations.

India factor

Trump committed the United States to an open-ended war in Afghanistan but the Pentagon has yet to decide how many more U.S. troops to send there as it is still drawing up a plan, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday. Trump also called for Pakistan‚Äôs great rival India to play a bigger role in Afghanistan, a prospect that will ring alarm bells for Pakistan‚Äôs generals. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs policy of engaging India and threatening action may actually constrain Pakistan and lead to the opposite of what he wants,‚Äù said Zahid Hussain, a Pakistani security analyst. The United States has no choice but to use Pakistani roads to resupply its troops in landlocked Afghanistan. U.S. officials fret that if Pakistan becomes an active foe, it could further destabilize Afghanistan and endanger U.S. soldiers. Trump offered few specifics in his address about Afghanistan on Monday, but promised a stepped-up military campaign against Taliban insurgents who have gained ground against U.S.-backed Afghan government forces.

The Afghan government welcomed Trump‚Äôs speech, but the Taliban said it would make the country a ‚Äúgraveyard for the American empire.‚Äù Mattis said he was waiting for a plan from the U.S. military‚Äôs chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, before deciding how many more troops to send to Afghanistan, where the United States is fighting its longest war. ‚ÄúWhen he brings that to me, I will determine how many more we need to send in,‚Äù Mattis told reporters during a visit to Baghdad. ‚ÄúIt may or may not be the number that is bandied about.‚Äù

U.S. officials have said Trump has given Mattis the authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to add to the roughly 8,400 already in Afghanistan. Trump authorized Mattis in June to set future Afghan troop levels amid a long and difficult debate in the administration about how to handle the 16-year war. Trump previously called for a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. On Monday, he said his original instinct was to pull out all American troops but that he was convinced otherwise by his military advisers after a lengthy strategy review. ‚ÄúThe consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum that terrorists, including ISIS (Islamic State) and al Qaeda, would instantly fill.‚Äù

U.S.-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban‚Äôs hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington that year. U.S. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three American presidents. About 2,400 U.S. troops have died in Afghanistan.

Trump said: ‚ÄúOur troops will fight to win,‚Äù but stressed that ultimately Afghanistan‚Äôs police and army must do most of the fighting. Most of the U.S. troops in Afghanistan work with a NATO-led training and advising mission, with the rest part of a counterterrorism force that mostly targets pockets of al Qaeda and Islamic State fighters.

"Kalimpong blast: ‚ÄòMiscreants did recee before attack‚Äô, police conduct raids","Officials investigate the blast site after an explosion near a motor-stand in Darjeeling on Saturday. (PTI Photo) Officials investigate the blast site after an explosion near a motor-stand in Darjeeling on Saturday. (PTI Photo)

Police suspect that miscreants did a recce before carrying out the grenade blast at Kalimpong police station that killed a civic volunteer and injured two others on Saturday night. Sources in the police said they have collected CCTV footages and are trying to identify the accused. The CID and forensic experts have already collected chemical samples of the grenade after the explosion.

‚ÄúWe suspect that the miscreants did a recce before the bomb was hurled at the police station. We are conducting raids,‚Äù SP (Kalimpong) Ajit Kumar Yadav told The Indian Express.

Sources said that the hand grenade was of high-intensity. ‚ÄúA specific material called ‚Äònitrogeletin‚Äô was used in an improvised metal pipe. It was of such a high intensity that the splinters were found 30 meters away from the blast spot,‚Äù said a source.

The technique of the explosion, sources said, was archaic. It was exploded non-electrically like how petrol bombs are burnt during festive season. A fuse was used to initiate the detonation of the grenade, they said. Sources said that though they suspect Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leaders behind the explosion, a breakthrough in the case will only be achieved after the police are able to identify the two motorcycle-borne miscreants captured in the CCTV cameras near the police station.

GJM chief Bimal Gurung and four other party leaders have been booked under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for the grenade blast. The UAPA had already been slapped against Gurung after a blast in Darjeeling‚Äôs Chowkbazar on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday.

"Don‚Äôt want Air India to go Kingfisher way, says Ashok Gajapathi Raju","Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju (Source: PTI) Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju (Source: PTI)

As the government charts out Air India‚Äôs disinvestment, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said he would not like the national carrier to ‚Äúgo the Kingfisher way‚Äù and people losing jobs. Air India, which is surviving on taxpayers‚Äô money, has been in the red for long but managed to eke out an operational profit of Rs 105 crore in 2015-16. A group of ministers, where Raju is also a member, is looking at the modalities for disinvestment of the national airline.

Noting that Air India has really worked well in the past few years, he said the whole idea of privatisation is to have a vibrant airline. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt set timelines. We have some indications within us and we hope that we will stick to it,‚Äù Raju said in reply to a query about tentative timeline for the disinvestment.

On whether Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) would be offered to Air India employees, he said personally he would like the airline to be vibrant and ‚Äúnot go the Kingfisher way or something like everybody has gone home and nobody has employment‚Äù.

Bogged down by financial woes, Vijay Mallya-promoted Kingfisher Airlines went belly up in 2012.‚ÄùI had already interacted with the press and what did I say, if you can find me a ‚Äòbakra‚Äô (scapegoat) who is willing to give me Rs 50,000 or 60,000 crore‚Ä¶ I am not searching for bakras but actually I am searching for proper investors and proper investors means a reasonably decent balance sheet,‚Äù Raju said.

His remarks came in response to a question on whether Air India‚Äôs debt would be waived off. The carrier has a debt burden of more than Rs 50,000 crore. To a query about the government recently deciding to withdraw certain privileges extended to RJD chief and former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav, the minister did not provide a direct reply, saying anything has to have a reasoning.

Last month, the government withdrew the tarmac access given to the vehicle of Yadav and his wife Rabri Devi at Patna airport. ‚ÄúAnything has to have a reasoning. Now what is the reasoning‚Ä¶ At the time of independence we had a privileged class with privileges. Today, we don‚Äôt have that.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Now for instance as civil aviation minister, I am not checked in India because nobody in India believes that the civil aviation minister is a threat to the civil aviation sector‚Ä¶ that resulted in a very unusual thing of me having a matchbox in my pocket,‚Äù Raju quipped. Asked about the preparations for the upcoming audit by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) later this year, Raju said it is going on. ‚ÄúWe are hoping that we will come out with flying colours. We need to keep our rating high and in fact second to none in the world,‚Äù he said.

"After successful Sri Lanka series, Cheteshwar Pujara returns to Nottinghamshire","Nottinghamshire head coach Peter Moores said Pujara‚Äôs return will give his side a significant boost. (Source: AP) Nottinghamshire head coach Peter Moores said Pujara‚Äôs return will give his side a significant boost. (Source: AP)

After playing a lead role in India‚Äôs 3-0 Test clean sweep over Sri Lanka, prolific India batsman Cheteshwar Pujara will re-join Nottinghamshire for the final four games as the club seeks a return to the eight-team elite of the county championships.

He will be available for the home and away fixtures against Northamptonshire, as well as the matches against Worcestershire (at Trent Bridge) and Sussex (at Hove), as the club look to secure promotion from Division Two.

The Notts are well-placed for an immediate return to the elite of the county championship as they lead Worcestershire at the top of the second tier by 35 points.

The 29-year-old Indian featured in four games earlier in the summer, scoring 223 runs at an average of 44.6, including 112 in the victory over Gloucestershire in late May.

The right-hander was recently part of the Indian side who beat Sri Lanka 3-0 in their recent Test series, scoring 309 runs at 77.25, including two centuries, in the process.

Nottinghamshire head coach Peter Moores said Pujara‚Äôs return will give his side a significant boost.

‚ÄúThe great thing is that he has already been in the squad this season and he fitted in so well both on and off the field. He is a fantastic player, and since he has been away he has had a great time of it in the Test matches for India,‚Äù said Moores.

‚ÄúSo we are getting a guy who is coming back in form and for the team spirit, Pudji coming back in is a huge boost for everybody,‚Äù he said.

Pujara will face a fascinating duel with fellow Indian Test star and off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who has signed for Worcestershire.

‚ÄúWe have got two really big home games against Northants and Worcester, because it is a chance for us to put pressure on two sides that are up there with us,‚Äù said Moores.

‚ÄúRuns on the board at Trent Bridge is always a big influence and having a player of Test-match quality in ‚ÄòPudji‚Äô is a real bonus.‚Äù

"Teej 2017: Why women do Parvati Puja, Mahurat Timings, Prasad and Bhog, and Rituals","On this day women wake up early and dress themselves in new clothes and elegant jewellery. (Source: Reuters) On this day women wake up early and dress themselves in new clothes and elegant jewellery. (Source: Reuters)

Thanks to the diversity in India, there is some festival or the other celebrated every 20-odd days, all through the year. However, the significance these festivals hold are known by few. Hartalika Teej, which is being celebrated today, is one such festival. Being one of the most important Teej out of three, Hariyali Teej and Kajari Teej, this festival is celebrated mainly by married women in the north Indian region of the country. It is celebrated one month after Haryali Teej, which was on July 26 this year. The origin of this festival goes back to the story of Ma Hartalika (also known as Goddess Parvati) who was devoted and in love with Lord Shiva. Hartalika Teej is celebrated to commemorate the day Lord Shiva accepted Parvati‚Äôs love and reciprocated. On this day, women pray to the lord for a loving and devoted life partner.

Significance

The word Hartalika is a combination of words ‚ÄòHarat‚Äô, which translate to abduction and ‚ÄòAalika‚Äô meaning female friend. According to the mythology, goddess Parvati‚Äôs father wanted her to marry lord Vishnu, oblivious to her devotion to lord Shiva. To avoid the marriage, Parvati asked her friends abduct her and stop the union. Hence, the origin of Teej. Difficult to please and woo, it took Parvati 108 births before Shiva acknowledged her love for him. Hence, it is believed that on this very day Parvati, after being accepted by Shiva, dedicated the auspicious day to women and proclaimed that whoever performed the desired rituals on this day would be blessed with a devoted partner and a happy married life.

Rituals and celebration

Women, on this auspicious day, wake up early in the morning and adorn themselves in new clothes and jewellery. In certain states the tradition of ‚Äòsolah shringar‚Äô (16 elements) is followed. They then visit the temple and pray to Shiva and Parvati. The puja, also known as Shiva-Parvati, is done after calculating an auspicious time and moment. A mud diya is lit in the morning and oiled regularly to keep it lit all through the day. Women observe a fast and avoid food and water. However, fruits and sweets can be eaten. In the evening, women come together and celebrate.

Timings and Mahurat

According to drikpanchang.com the auspicious time and Muhurat for this year‚Äôs prayer is as follows:

Pratahkal Hartalika Puja Muhurat = 05:58 to 08:32 Duration = 2 Hours 33 Mins (Morning)

Pradoshkal Hartalika Puja Muhurat = 18:47 to 20:27 Duration = 1 Hour 39 Mins (Evening)

Prasad and Bhog

Though women keep a fast all through the day, traditional sweets such as ghewar and pedas are offered to the gods as prasad.

Donald Trump warns Pakistan against providing safe havens to terrorists: Full text of his speech,"‚ÄúIn Afghanistan and Pakistan, America‚Äôs interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter‚Äù, Donald Trump said. ‚ÄúIn Afghanistan and Pakistan, America‚Äôs interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter‚Äù, Donald Trump said.

Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Tillerson, members of the Cabinet, General Dunford, Deputy Secretary Shanahan, and Colonel Duggan. Most especially, thank you to the men and women of Fort Myer and every member of the United States military at home and abroad.We send our thoughts and prayers to the families of our brave sailors who were injured and lost after a tragic collision at sea, as well as to those conducting the search and recovery efforts.

I am here tonight to lay out our path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia. But before I provide the details of our new strategy, I want to say a few words to the servicemembers here with us tonight, to those watching from their posts, and to all Americans listening at home.

Since the founding of our republic, our country has produced a special class of heroes whose selflessness, courage, and resolve is unmatched in human history. American patriots from every generation have given their last breath on the battlefield for our nation and for our freedom. Through their lives ‚Äî and though their lives were cut short, in their deeds they achieved total immortality.

Donald Trump: India‚Äôs role critical in Afghanistan‚Äôs stability; Pakistan must stop sheltering terrorists

By following the heroic example of those who fought to preserve our republic, we can find the inspiration our country needs to unify, to heal, and to remain one nation under God. The men and women of our military operate as one team, with one shared mission, and one shared sense of purpose.

They transcend every line of race, ethnicity, creed, and color to serve together ‚Äî and sacrifice together ‚Äî in absolutely perfect cohesion. That is because all servicemembers are brothers and sisters. They‚Äôre all part of the same family; it‚Äôs called the American family. They take the same oath, fight for the same flag, and live according to the same law. They are bound together by common purpose, mutual trust, and selfless devotion to our nation and to each other.

The soldier understands what we, as a nation, too often forget that a wound inflicted upon a single member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all. When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. And when one citizen suffers an injustice, we all suffer together.

Loyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another. Love for America requires love for all of its people. When we open our hearts to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, no place for bigotry, and no tolerance for hate.

The young men and women we send to fight our wars abroad deserve to return to a country that is not at war with itself at home. We cannot remain a force for peace in the world if we are not at peace with each other.

As we send our bravest to defeat our enemies overseas ‚Äî and we will always win ‚Äî let us find the courage to heal our divisions within. Let us make a simple promise to the men and women we ask to fight in our name that, when they return home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one.

Thanks to the vigilance and skill of the American military and of our many allies throughout the world, horrors on the scale of September 11th ‚Äî and nobody can ever forget that ‚Äî have not been repeated on our shores.

But we must also acknowledge the reality I am here to talk about tonight: that nearly 16 years after September 11th attacks, after the extraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure, the American people are weary of war without victory. Nowhere is this more evident than with the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in American history ‚Äî 17 years.

I share the American people‚Äôs frustration. I also share their frustration over a foreign policy that has spent too much time, energy, money, and most importantly lives, trying to rebuild countries in our own image, instead of pursuing our security interests above all other considerations.

That is why, shortly after my inauguration, I directed Secretary of Defense Mattis and my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of all strategic options in Afghanistan and South Asia.

My original instinct was to pull out ‚Äî and, historically, I like following my instincts. But all my life I‚Äôve heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office; in other words, when you‚Äôre President of the United States. So I studied Afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle. After many meetings, over many months, we held our final meeting last Friday at Camp David, with my Cabinet and generals, to complete our strategy. I arrived at three fundamental conclusions about America‚Äôs core interests in Afghanistan.

First, our nation must seek an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made, especially the sacrifices of lives. The men and women who serve our nation in combat deserve a plan for victory. They deserve the tools they need, and the trust they have earned, to fight and to win.

Second, the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable. 9/11, the worst terrorist attack in our history, was planned and directed from Afghanistan because that country was ruled by a government that gave comfort and shelter to terrorists. A hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum that terrorists, including ISIS and al Qaeda, would instantly fill, just as happened before September 11th.

And, as we know, in 2011, America hastily and mistakenly withdrew from Iraq. As a result, our hard-won gains slipped back into the hands of terrorist enemies. Our soldiers watched as cities they had fought for, and bled to liberate, and won, were occupied by a terrorist group called ISIS. The vacuum we created by leaving too soon gave safe haven for ISIS to spread, to grow, recruit, and launch attacks. We cannot repeat in Afghanistan the mistake our leaders made in Iraq.

Third and finally, I concluded that the security threats we face in Afghanistan and the broader region are immense. Today, 20 U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations are active in Afghanistan and Pakistan ‚Äî the highest concentration in any region anywhere in the world.

For its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and terror. The threat is worse because Pakistan and India are two nuclear-armed states whose tense relations threaten to spiral into conflict. And that could happen.

No one denies that we have inherited a challenging and troubling situation in Afghanistan and South Asia, but we do not have the luxury of going back in time and making different or better decisions. When I became President, I was given a bad and very complex hand, but I fully knew what I was getting into: big and intricate problems. But, one way or another, these problems will be solved ‚Äî I‚Äôm a problem solver ‚Äî and, in the end, we will win.

We must address the reality of the world as it exists right now ‚Äî the threats we face, and the confronting of all of the problems of today, and extremely predictable consequences of a hasty withdrawal.

We need look no further than last week‚Äôs vile, vicious attack in Barcelona to understand that terror groups will stop at nothing to commit the mass murder of innocent men, women and children. You saw it for yourself. Horrible.

As I outlined in my speech in Saudi Arabia three months ago, America and our partners are committed to stripping terrorists of their territory, cutting off their funding, and exposing the false allure of their evil ideology.

Terrorists who slaughter innocent people will find no glory in this life or the next. They are nothing but thugs, and criminals, and predators, and ‚Äî that‚Äôs right ‚Äî losers. Working alongside our allies, we will break their will, dry up their recruitment, keep them from crossing our borders, and yes, we will defeat them, and we will defeat them handily.

In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America‚Äôs interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter.

But to prosecute this war, we will learn from history. As a result of our comprehensive review, American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically in the following ways:

A core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions. I‚Äôve said it many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance the dates we intend to begin, or end, military options. We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities.

Conditions on the ground ‚Äî not arbitrary timetables ‚Äî will guide our strategy from now on. America‚Äôs enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out. I will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will.

Another fundamental pillar of our new strategy is the integration of all instruments of American power ‚Äî diplomatic, economic, and military ‚Äî toward a successful outcome.

Someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but nobody knows if or when that will ever happen. America will continue its support for the Afghan government and the Afghan military as they confront the Taliban in the field.

Ultimately, it is up to the people of Afghanistan to take ownership of their future, to govern their society, and to achieve an everlasting peace. We are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live, or how to govern their own complex society. We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.

The next pillar of our new strategy is to change the approach and how to deal with Pakistan. We can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond. Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists.

In the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner. Our militaries have worked together against common enemies. The Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism. We recognize those contributions and those sacrifices.

But Pakistan has also sheltered the same organizations that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country‚Äôs harboring of militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order, and to peace.

Another critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States. We appreciate India‚Äôs important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.

Finally, my administration will ensure that you, the brave defenders of the American people, will have the necessary tools and rules of engagement to make this strategy work, and work effectively and work quickly.

I have already lifted restrictions the previous administration placed on our warfighters that prevented the Secretary of Defense and our commanders in the field from fully and swiftly waging battle against the enemy. Micromanagement from Washington, D.C. does not win battles. They are won in the field drawing upon the judgment and expertise of wartime commanders and frontline soldiers acting in real time, with real authority, and with a clear mission to defeat the enemy.

That‚Äôs why we will also expand authority for American armed forces to target the terrorist and criminal networks that sow violence and chaos throughout Afghanistan. These killers need to know they have nowhere to hide; that no place is beyond the reach of American might and Americans arms. Retribution will be fast and powerful.

As we lift restrictions and expand authorities in the field, we are already seeing dramatic results in the campaign to defeat ISIS, including the liberation of Mosul in Iraq.

Since my inauguration, we have achieved record-breaking success in that regard. We will also maximize sanctions and other financial and law enforcement actions against these networks to eliminate their ability to export terror. When America commits its warriors to battle, we must ensure they have every weapon to apply swift, decisive, and overwhelming force.

Our troops will fight to win. We will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.

We will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy with additional troop and funding increases in line with our own. We are confident they will. Since taking office, I have made clear that our allies and partners must contribute much more money to our collective defense, and they have done so.

In this struggle, the heaviest burden will continue to be borne by the good people of Afghanistan and their courageous armed forces. As the prime minister of Afghanistan has promised, we are going to participate in economic development to help defray the cost of this war to us.

Afghanistan is fighting to defend and secure their country against the same enemies who threaten us. The stronger the Afghan security forces become, the less we will have to do. Afghans will secure and build their own nation and define their own future. We want them to succeed.

But we will no longer use American military might to construct democracies in faraway lands, or try to rebuild other countries in our own image. Those days are now over. Instead, we will work with allies and partners to protect our shared interests. We are not asking others to change their way of life, but to pursue common goals that allow our children to live better and safer lives. This principled realism will guide our decisions moving forward.

Military power alone will not bring peace to Afghanistan or stop the terrorist threat arising in that country. But strategically applied force aims to create the conditions for a political process to achieve a lasting peace.

America will work with the Afghan government as long as we see determination and progress. However, our commitment is not unlimited, and our support is not a blank check. The government of Afghanistan must carry their share of the military, political, and economic burden. The American people expect to see real reforms, real progress, and real results. Our patience is not unlimited. We will keep our eyes wide open.

In abiding by the oath I took on January 20th, I will remain steadfast in protecting American lives and American interests. In this effort, we will make common cause with any nation that chooses to stand and fight alongside us against this global threat. Terrorists take heed: America will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat.

Under my administration, many billions of dollars more is being spent on our military. And this includes vast amounts being spent on our nuclear arsenal and missile defense.

In every generation, we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed. We prevailed because we know who we are and what we are fighting for.

Not far from where we are gathered tonight, hundreds of thousands of America‚Äôs greatest patriots lay in eternal rest at Arlington National Cemetery. There is more courage, sacrifice, and love in those hallowed grounds than in any other spot on the face of the Earth.

Many of those who have fought and died in Afghanistan enlisted in the months after September 11th, 2001. They volunteered for a simple reason: They loved America, and they were determined to protect her.

Now we must secure the cause for which they gave their lives. We must unite to defend America from its enemies abroad. We must restore the bonds of loyalty among our citizens at home, and we must achieve an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the enormous price that so many have paid.

Our actions, and in the months to come, all of them will honor the sacrifice of every fallen hero, every family who lost a loved one, and every wounded warrior who shed their blood in defense of our great nation. With our resolve, we will ensure that your service and that your families will bring about the defeat of our enemies and the arrival of peace.

We will push onward to victory with power in our hearts, courage in our souls, and everlasting pride in each and every one of you.

Thank you. May God bless our military. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.

South Korea‚Äôs first woman PM released from jail,"outh Korea‚Äôs first female prime minister, Han Myeong-Sook. (Source: Reuters) outh Korea‚Äôs first female prime minister, Han Myeong-Sook. (Source: Reuters)

South Korea‚Äôs first female prime minister was released from prison on Wednesday after completing a two-year sentence for accepting illicit political funds. Han Myeong-Sook, now 73, was prime minister for a year from April 2006 under the liberal government of then-president Roh Moo-Hyun.

She was the first woman to hold the post of prime minister in South Korea, and also the first former premier to be put behind bars. A few years later Park Geun-Hye ‚Äî currently on trial for corruption after being ousted in a sprawling scandal ‚Äî became South Korea‚Äôs first woman president.

Han was convicted in 2015 of receiving 880 million won (then USD 760,000) from a businessman in illegal campaign funding for her eventually unsuccessful 2007 bid to secure her party‚Äôs presidential nomination.

Han has denied any wrongdoing and accused the then-conservative government of using state prosecutors to tarnish her reputation.

She was greeted by politicians and hundreds of supporters as she emerged from a detention centre on the outskirts of Seoul early today.

‚ÄúThere has been insufferable pain during the past two years but I have finally met a new world and I am grateful,‚Äù she was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency.

Several former presidents have been embroiled in corruption scandals in South Korea, where politics and big business have long been closely tied.

Former leaders Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo served jail terms in the 1990s for charges including bribery and treason, and ex-president Roh Moo-Hyun ‚Äî the mentor of President Moon Jae-In ‚Äî killed himself in 2009 after being questioned over graft.

"US must respect Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty, security concerns: China","Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi (Source: AP/File) Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi (Source: AP/File)

The US should recognise Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äúimportant role‚Äù in Afghanistan and respect its sovereignty and legitimate security concerns, China‚Äôs top diplomat told Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, defending Beijing‚Äôs all-weather ally for a second time in as many days. State Councillor Yang Jiechi‚Äôs remarks came two days after US President Donald Trump sternly warned Pakistan against providing safe heavens to militants.

Trump on Tuesday unveiled his Afghan policy and also sought an enhanced role for India in bringing peace in the war-ravaged country. Yang during a phone call with Tillerson yesterday defended Pakistan‚Äôs role in Afghanistan. ‚ÄúWe should attach importance to Pakistan‚Äôs important role in Afghanistan and respect Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and legitimate security concerns,‚Äù Yang said.

Elaborating on Yang‚Äôs intervention expressing full backing for Pakistan, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the media here that China ‚Äúvalued Pakistan‚Äôs role in Afghanistan issue and respect Pakistan‚Äôs sovereign and reasonable security concerns‚Äù.

China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry had also backed Pakistan soon after Trump‚Äôs statement. ‚Äú(On the) President Trump‚Äôs remarks on Pakistan, I should say that Pakistan is in the frontline of fighting terrorism, made sacrifices to fighting terrorism, making important contribution to upholding peace and stability,‚Äù Hua had said on Tuesday.

She had said that the international community should truly affirm the efforts by Pakistan on the matter. In his policy address on Afghanistan and South Asia, Trump had said the pillar of his new strategy was a change in America‚Äôs approach to Pakistan, considered a long-time ally of Washington.

Trump‚Äôs tough speech on Pakistan came as its Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua held talks with Chinese top officials including Foreign Minister Wang Yi during her maiden visit here in the last few days. Highlighting the importance of her talks, Hua told the media today that ‚ÄúChina and Pakistan are all-weather friends and partners. We have always given to each other support to our core issues and interests‚Äù.

She also lauded Pakistan‚Äôs support to USD 50 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) over which India has raised protests as it traversed through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. ‚ÄúAgainst the current backdrop, we appreciate Pakistani efforts in ensuring security as well as anti-terrorism cooperation in the CPEC,‚Äù she said.

For her part, Janjua said ‚ÄúPakistan will not change its policy towards China no matter how the domestic situation varies‚Äù. Pakistan will remain committed to the CPEC as well as promoting new advancement in our bilateral relations,‚Äù Hua quoted her as saying.

The government also announced that the process of collection of hides will be closely monitored and FIRs against any one collecting hides by force will be registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act.

Jim Mattis arrives in Iraq for unannounced visit to meet Iraqi leaders,"Mattis has warned that the end of the militant group is far from close. (Source: AP Photo) Mattis has warned that the end of the militant group is far from close. (Source: AP Photo)

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis arrived in Iraq on Tuesday, just days after the start of an offensive to take back the city of Tal Afar, to speak with Iraqi leaders about the next steps in the fight against Islamic State. Mattis has warned that the end of the militant group is far from close. Iraqi security forces launched an offensive to take back the city of Tal Afar on Sunday, their latest objective in the U.S.-backed campaign to defeat Islamic State militants, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said.

A long-time stronghold of hardline Sunni Muslim insurgents, Tal Afar, 80 km (50 miles) west of Mosul in Iraq‚Äôs far north, has experienced cycles of sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shi‚Äôite Muslims. ‚ÄúISIS‚Äô days are certainly numbered, but it is not over yet and it is not going to be over anytime soon,‚Äù Mattis told reporters in Amman. Mattis said that after retaking Tal Afar, Iraqi forces would move against the western Euphrates river valley. He added that Iraqi security forces were capable of carrying out simultaneous operations.

Brett McGurk, the U.S. special envoy to the coalition against Islamic State, told reporters that while the battle for Tal Afar would be difficult, Iraqi forces had retaken 235 square kilometers (90.7 miles) in the first 24 hours. U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mattis, who will meet Abadi and Defense Minister Arfan al-Hayali, would discuss the future of U.S. forces in Iraq after the fall of the remaining cities under Islamic State and the role they could play in stabilizing operations. The officials said that while major cities like Mosul have been largely been cleared of Islamic State militants, there were concerns about the ability of Iraqi forces to hold territory.

Mattis said pockets of resistance remained in west Mosul, including sleeper cells, and attention would be turned after they were cleared. ‚ÄúIt is not going to happen overnight‚Ä¶it is going to be a heavy lift for them going forward, but the proper governance would involve local representation in their day to day lives,‚Äù Mattis said. Islamic State is also on the back foot in Syria, where Kurdish and Arab militias backed by a U.S.-led coalition have captured swathes of its territory in the north and are assaulting its former Syrian ‚Äúcapital‚Äù of Raqqa.

McGurk said that about 2,000 Islamic State fighters remained in Raqqa and as much as 60 percent of the city had been retaken. The jihadist group is now falling back deeper into the Euphrates valley region of eastern Syria. Mattis added that the next step for forces fighting Islamic State in Syria would be to move against the middle Euphrates valley, in a reference to the militants‚Äô stronghold in Deir al-Zor province southeast of Raqqa.

KURDISH REFERENDUM

Iraq‚Äôs Kurds have said they will have a referendum on independence on Sept. 25 despite concerns from Iraq‚Äôs neighbors who have Kurdish minorities within their borders, and a U.S. request to postpone it. However, a senior Kurdish official said Iraq‚Äôs Kurds may consider the possibility of postponing the referendum in return for financial and political concessions from the central government in Baghdad. McGurk said the Kurdish delegation‚Äôs recent visit to Baghdad was encouraging.

A U.S. official said Mattis would press Massoud Barzani, president of the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), to call off the referendum. The Pentagon signed an agreement with Peshmerga forces last year to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and equipment. The U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the memorandum of understanding would expire soon and suggested that Mattis could use it as a bargaining chip.

The United States and other Western nations fear the vote could ignite a fresh conflict with Baghdad and possibly neighboring countries, diverting attention from the ongoing war against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

On Love and Desire,"Amitava Kumar during his book Launch ‚ÄòThe Lovers ‚Äò in New Delhi on Wednesday, Auguct 09, 2017. (Express photo by Abhinav Saha) Amitava Kumar during his book Launch ‚ÄòThe Lovers ‚Äò in New Delhi on Wednesday, Auguct 09, 2017. (Express photo by Abhinav Saha)

Amitava Kumar‚Äôs new novel maps the journey of a young man, Kailash, in ‚ÄúReagan‚Äôs America‚Äù as he searches for love and meaning in life. Woven within the fabric of a larger political narrative, Kumar calls The Lovers (Aleph Book Company, Rs 599), an ‚Äúin-between novel‚Äù ‚Äî somewhere between fiction and non-fiction. ‚ÄúIt speaks about the current situation, in the sense that it gives immigrants a voice. Not just a voice but a voice on their own terms. My narrator doesn‚Äôt simply declare his right to live there, he wants the right to love too,‚Äù says Kumar, who recently launched the book in Delhi.

In The Lovers, Kumar says, he has written about love and desire like never before. ‚ÄúI am getting old and I thought the body forgets. Through this book, I wanted to remember who I was. When I went to the US, I always thought that I would come back soon, but time kept passing. So I also thought that I must write about my life in the US, the 30 years that I have been there,‚Äù says Kumar, whose previous books include Home Products (2010) and non-fiction works such as Husband of a Fanatic (2004) and Passport Photos (2000), among others.

In the novel, Kailash‚Äôs professor and mentor, Ehsaan Ali, plays a pivotal role. Ali‚Äôs character was inspired by political scientist and anti-war activist Eqbal Ahmad, who was born in Bihar and moved to Pakistan after Partition. Ahmad studied in the US and ended up teaching there. ‚ÄúI never met him, but he has been an inspiring figure for me, not only because he was born in Bihar but because he embodied a radical cosmopolitanism,‚Äù says the Arrah-born author.

Cover of Amitava Kumar‚Äôs book The Lovers Cover of Amitava Kumar‚Äôs book The Lovers

In the US and the UK, the book has been published with a different title ‚Äî Immigrant, Montana. ‚ÄúI think it was David Davidar who chose this title (The Lovers). I like it because my narrator says he tore out a page from a magazine in the library that had Picasso‚Äôs The Lovers printed on it. This was the painting that Picasso did after first making love,‚Äù says Kumar, 54, who is currently the Helen D. Lockwood Professor of English at Vassar College in New York‚Äôs Poughkeepsie.

As a graduate student in the US in the late 1980s, Kumar maintained a journal that has served as inspiration for the novel. ‚ÄúI saved many letters from that time, some of them were written by women, which I was surprised to discover. It also includes some letters by my mother. But reading those letters was depressing ‚Äî the past coming back at you like that. So I left those. Instead, I used to read the book My Mistress‚Äôs Sparrow is Dead, a collection of short stories. I read one story each day and wrote the next day. In other words, I used literature to call back some memories and also imagine other things,‚Äù he says.

Is privacy a fundamental right? nine-judge Supreme Court bench will rule today,"Privacy verdict: A nine-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court will decide whether privacy is a fundamental right. (File Photo) Privacy verdict: A nine-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court will decide whether privacy is a fundamental right. (File Photo)

Do Indians have a fundamental right to privacy? It will be known Thursday when a nine-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court answers this question on a reference from a five-judge bench. The nine-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India J S Khehar and comprising Justices J Chelameswar, S A Bobde, R K Agrawal, R F Nariman, A M Sapre, D Y Chandrachud, S K Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer, had reserved its verdict on the matter on August 2 after extensive arguments over six days.

The right to privacy question was referred to the nine-judge bench after a clutch of petitions challenging the Aadhaar Act came up before the five-judge bench. These petitions claimed that the Aadhaar Act violated people‚Äôs right to privacy.

But the existing position of law, as settled by an eight-judge Supreme Court bench in 1954 (in the M P Sharma case) and subsequently by a six-judge bench in 1962 (in the Kharak Singh case), was that there was no fundamental right to privacy in the Constitution. The five-judge bench concluded that the correctness of these rulings would have to be examined first before it could take a call on the petitions challenging Aadhaar. The question was referred to the nine judges.

The contentions of the parties and queries from judges during the hearing have provided a glimpse of what a yes-verdict could mean for the country, especially in the background of technological advances and its encroachment into the lives of people.

Senior counsel Gopal Subramanium, who argued for declaring privacy a fundamental right, propounded the stand that ‚Äúliberty is a pre-existing law‚Äù and ‚Äúall that the Constitution did is to enumerate it‚Äù. He said ‚Äúprivacy was embedded in the expressions liberty and dignity as appearing in the Preamble to the Constitution. Liberty is inalienable‚Ä¶ all choices are a part of the exercise of liberty‚Ä¶ humans cannot exist without liberty‚Ä¶ liberty is heart and soul of the Constitution‚Äù.

Senior counsel Soli Sorabjee, also representing the petitioners, said ‚Äúnon-mentioning of privacy rights explicitly in the fundamental rights does not signify it does not exist. It can be deduced from other fundamental rights mentioned in Part III of the Constitution. Freedom of press too was not mentioned but deduced so‚Äù.

The Centre, however, took the position that privacy could be a fundamental right, but a ‚Äúwholly qualified‚Äù one, implying that it would be subject to reasonable restrictions like other fundamental rights. Attorney General K K Venugopal said ‚Äúsince the right to privacy consists of diverse aspects and is a sub-species of the right to liberty, every aspect of sub-species will not qualify as a fundamental right‚Äù. He sought to stress that privacy as a right could not be seen in isolation and was, in fact, a ‚Äúconglomerate of rights‚Äù which had to be treated on case-to-case basis.

Though the question of Aadhaar was not being debated during this hearing, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the nodal agency for implementing Aadhaar and a party in the matter, sought to reassure the court that ‚Äúprivacy and confidentiality were non-negotiable under the Aadhaar Act‚Äù. It was also pointed out to the court during the hearing that the Constituent Assembly had considered whether privacy should be a fundamental right at the time of drafting the Constitution and decided against it.

Justice Chandrachud wondered whether privacy, if recognised as a fundamental right, would be available only against state action or extend to actions by private individuals too. The challenge before the court, if it decides to rule in favour of privacy rights, will be to balance it vis-a-vis the basket of statutory and Constitutional rights available to citizens and to ensure that stress on privacy doesn‚Äôt stifle the quest for innovation.

Justice Chandrachud expressed this in as many words: ‚ÄúIf privacy is right to make choice, choice in what area ‚Äî family, sexual orientation, gender identity, surveillance. What all?‚Ä¶ For instance, my right to cohabit with my wife is right to privacy but my right to send my children to school isn‚Äôt. There is some element of autonomy in the exercise of liberty which does not lie in the realm of liberty. It need not necessarily be the case that everything that falls within liberty also falls within privacy,‚Äù he said.

That the verdict will be one of immense significance was evident when he observed that it could even upset the judgment in the Naz Foundation case which pertained to the challenge to Section 377 of the IPC. In July 2009, the Delhi High Court had read down the section and upheld consensual sex between adults in same-sex relations. But the Supreme Court overturned this in December 2013, saying only Parliament had the power to change law.

Highlighting the need to strike a balance between individual rights with the requirements of the state in the IT era, the court said ‚Äú‚Ä¶whether we like it or not, we live in a world of big data and the state is entitled to regulate privacy. Privacy is not so absolute or overarching to prevent the state from legislating.‚Äù

During the hearing, the government informed the court that it had set up a committee under Justice (retired) B N Srikrishna to ‚Äúidentify key data protection issues in India and recommend measures of addressing them‚Äù.

(PTI Photo)

Playing a good host, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj promptly walked up to Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and offered him a glass of water after he began to cough due to a sore throat while speaking at a press meet with counterpart Narendra Modi. The two prime ministers addressed the media after holding extensive bilateral talks at the Hyderabad House here.

As Deuba was at the fag end of his address, he coughed and his voice turned hoarse. Without waiting for officials, Swaraj, who was sitting in the front row, quietly walked up to Deuba, who continued to read his statement from the podium.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened the lid of a water jar kept in front of them, Swaraj poured water in a glass and offered it to the Nepalese prime minister. Officials from either side had little time to react as all of it happened in a matter of seconds.

Unaware of this, Deuba went reading his address for a few moments, before he realised that Swaraj was waiting for him with the glass. A surprised Deuba said, ‚ÄúSorry, I have a bad throat‚Äù and accepted the water. Swaraj waited to take the glass back but then an official stepped in and she went back to her seat while Deuba continued his address.

The External Affairs Minister is known for her prompt response on twitter to Indians in distress abroad.

China Construction Bank Corp (CCB) is raising at least 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) for a fund to finance investments related to Beijing‚Äôs Belt and Road initiative, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The people said China‚Äôs second-biggest bank by assets was raising cash onshore and offshore, and has already been running roadshows with prospective investors. They could not be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.

CCB did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese President Xi Jinping in May pledged a $124 billion funding boost to help his plan to build a modern Silk Road, connecting China with new and old trading partners. He also said China would encourage financial institutions to expand their overseas yuan fund businesses. Beijing is trying to contain overseas deals after some extravagant purchases in recent years, but acquisitions by Chinese companies in countries that are part of the Belt and Road initiative are soaring, totalling $33 billion as of mid-August. That compares with a $31 billion tally for all of 2016, showed Thomson Reuters data.

The people said CCB would raise U.S. dollars for the offshore portion of the fund and yuan from onshore investors. Some of the onshore capital could be used for Belt and Road deals overseas, two of the people said.

Deuba, who took over from Prachanda as the prime minister of Nepal in a power-sharing deal in June, will be on a five- day visit to India from tomorrow on his first official trip abroad.

Oli, the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal-Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), underlined the need for Deuba to inform the people about the reasons behind his visit to India at a time when the House session was underway. Addressing the addressing the parliament, Oli said Nepal has been badly hit by floods and landslides, which have killed nearly 150 people and rendered another 10,000 homeless.

‚ÄúAt this moment, extensive talks and discussions about the matters should be held with the neighbour during the visit so as to seek permanent solutions to frequent problems of floods caused by border rivers in the Terai region,‚Äù he said. He said the bilateral energy policy unveiled by India recently was not in Nepal‚Äôs interest and ‚Äúwould contribute nothing‚Äù to promote the Himalayan country‚Äôs energy sector.

He said Nepal as the current chair of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation should play an important role to de-escalate geopolitical and other regional tensions. Oli also asked Deuba to discuss the 1950 Peace and Friendship Treaty with India. The treaty establishing a close strategic bilateral relationship has often been criticised by some political parties here as being skewed in India‚Äôs favour.

On the demands by Madhesi people for a Constitution amendment to give more political powers the community, Oli said his party could have supported it had the proposal come through an ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù channel and was based on consensus. Nepal‚Äôs parliament yesterday failed to pass the Constitution amendment bill, aimed at addressing the two main demands of the Madhesi people ‚Äì more representation in the Parliament and redrawing of provincial boundaries.

Madhesis, mostly of Indian-origin, launched a prolonged agitation between September 2015 and February last year against the implementation of the new Constitution which they felt marginalised the Terai community.

Extroverts spend more on luxury goods,"Extroverts tend to care more about their status and presentation socially. (Source: File Photo) Extroverts tend to care more about their status and presentation socially. (Source: File Photo)

Extrovert people on low incomes buy more luxury goods than their introvert peers to compensate for the experience of low financial status, new research has found. The study, published in the journal Psychological Science, used real life spending data from bank accounts in Britain to investigate the spending habits of richer and poorer people with different personality types.

People living on a low income often feel low status in society and spend a higher percentage of their money on goods and services that are perceived to have a high status.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve shown that personality looks to be an important factor in how people respond to living with limited resources,‚Äù explained study co-author Joe Gladstone from University College London. ‚ÄúWe hope this new association will help us better understand which people may be likely to engage in behaviour that perpetuates the conditions of financial hardship,‚Äù Gladstone said.

Previous research had found that people who are sociable and outgoing care more about their social status than others. The new research showed that when extrovert people have a lower income, they spend proportionately more on status goods than introverts on the same income.

The study was conducted in collaboration with a UK-based multinational bank. Customers were asked whether they would complete a standard personality questionnaire, and to consent to their responses being matched anonymously for research purposes with their bank transaction data. The study analysed thousands of transactions from 718 customers over 12 months.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear from our study that an extrovert personality is a driver for low-income individuals purchasing more luxury goods, and this is most likely to compensate for a perceived low social status that isn‚Äôt as keenly felt by introverts,‚Äù study co-author Blaine Landis from University College London said. ‚ÄúWe saw very little difference in the spending habits of introverts and extroverts with high incomes,‚Äù Landis added.

Civilian drills grow lax among South Koreans used to threats,"In this Wednesday, August 23, 2017, photo, people pass by a bomb shelter sign before a civil defense drill in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: AP Photo) In this Wednesday, August 23, 2017, photo, people pass by a bomb shelter sign before a civil defense drill in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: AP Photo)

Once or twice a year, activity on the streets of South Korea‚Äôs capital freezes as a wailing siren marks a nationwide drill aimed at preparing against a North Korean attack. Cars stop on roads. Pedestrians move into buildings and subway stations. Government buildings are evacuated. The scenes during the latest air-raid drill on Wednesday are remarkable for turning parts of this usually bustling city into a ghost town. But a closer look raises questions about whether the exercises are adequately preparing South Koreans while the threat from North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and missile program grows.

For many, there‚Äôs no real training, just people standing around in schoolyards or other gathering spots, staring into their smartphones, chatting amiably or just looking bored or frustrated. Many schools don‚Äôt participate in the air-raid drills and those that do often escort children outside. Leaving their buildings would be a good idea during earthquakes, but a terrible decision during attacks.

The country has nearly 19,000 evacuation shelters, mostly built in subway stations and the parking garages of apartments and large buildings. Yet a 2014 government survey found that an overwhelming number of South Koreans did not know which shelters were closest to their homes. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think anybody knows,‚Äù 31-year-old Park Ji-na said shortly after Wednesday‚Äôs drill.

The 2014 survey, by the National Disaster Management Research Institute, also found that only 10 percent of the 145 adults polled had CPR experience, and just 7 percent owned gas masks. Most South Koreans have lived their entire lives facing threats from North Korea, and few show great worry.

‚ÄúRealistically, the people who live in this country aren‚Äôt thinking much about‚Äù the threats, Park said. ‚ÄúThey are on the news all the time, but it‚Äôs not like they are real threats affecting our lives.‚Äù National and local governments and even companies organize the exercises. South Korea launched its current civil defense program in 1975, when the country was still run by a military dictator. Through the 1980s, nationwide evacuation drills were held on the 15th of nearly every month.

In decades past, civil servants wearing yellow armbands whistled people off the streets and teachers ordered school children to crouch under their desks for exercises that lasted 30 minutes. There were even nighttime drills where people were instructed to turn off the lights and televisions at their homes to deter an imaginary attack by North Korean bombers.

The drills became less frequent and more casual after the 1990s amid rising public complaints and a temporary improvement in relations between the rival Koreas. Today, though North Korea‚Äôs nuclear weapons development and fierce rhetoric have drawn deep international concern, South Koreans are both inured to the threats and distracted by life in a country that is now about Asia‚Äôs busiest and most vibrant.

Kim Dae Young, a military expert at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, said the drills are failing to equip people with even basic information, such as how and where to evacuate and how to secure drinking water and other supplies during times of crisis. Noh Sang-yeol also was among those who did not know the shelter closest to his home. The 65-year-old said there‚Äôs a need to strengthen training programs because the current drills are doing ‚Äúnothing at all‚Äù to prepare people.

‚ÄúI read from the newspapers that people in Japan, Guam or Taiwan are preparing well and even stacking up on food in case of emergency, and that made me think whether I should begin buying water or battery supplies,‚Äù he said.

An official from Seoul‚Äôs Ministry of Interior and Safety said that although South Korea is considering whether its civil defense programs should be strengthened, it would be impossible to bring quick changes.

‚ÄúThese drills are intended for the entire nation and changes can‚Äôt be made overnight by one or two people sitting on a desk,‚Äù said the official, who didn‚Äôt want to be named, citing office rules. ‚ÄúThere should be close and comprehensive studies on people‚Äôs willingness to participate and their awareness of national security issues before we could specifically determine what kind of training would be possible.‚Äù

Wednesday‚Äôs air-raid drill followed North Korea‚Äôs two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July and its threat to lob missiles toward Guam earlier this month. The government had planned to send military planes over major cities emitting colored smoke to simulate an attack, but the flights were canceled in Seoul and many other areas due to heavy rain and low clouds, according to the interior ministry.

Government workers during the drill distributed leaflets instructing people what to do during an attack, which included recommendations to prepare to gas masks, raincoats and soap in case of nuclear, biological or chemical attacks. It also reminded people to evacuate to the higher floors of buildings, instead of subway stations or parking garages, in case of chemical attacks.

The civil defense drill coincided with a large-scale joint military exercise between Washington and Seoul that runs through Aug. 31. This annual exercise has predictably drawn a verbal outburst from Pyongyang, which claims the war games are an invasion rehearsal.

The lax civilian drills bother experts, who say stronger training is crucial, especially for the 25 million living in Seoul and its neighboring metropolitan areas. They would only have minutes to respond to incoming North Korean missiles or artillery shells.

The practices of the 1970s and 80s won‚Äôt return, but experts say the drills should at least focus on giving people practical skills in rescue and evacuation.

Even the South‚Äôs emergency infrastructure is lacking, said Kim, the military expert. Aside from a few facilities in small border islands that have occasionally seen military skirmishes between the Koreas, South Korea‚Äôs civilian shelters are not equipped to handle attacks involving nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, Kim said.

‚ÄúThe government should start building bunkers that could withstand nuclear attacks in Seoul and the neighboring metropolitan area,‚Äù Kim said. ‚ÄúCivil defense needs to become a more important part of the national defense strategy as North Korean threats grow.‚Äù The ministry official, however, said upgrading thousands of shelters to protect against such attacks would be financially implausible.

Carnival hits town as Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor ready to fight,"Floyd Mayweather goes into the bout undefeated and hoping to keep his 49-0 tally intact. (Source: Reuters) Floyd Mayweather goes into the bout undefeated and hoping to keep his 49-0 tally intact. (Source: Reuters)

The carnival finally hit town Tuesday, with Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather Jr. putting on a bit of a fashion show before promising to knock each other out in their highly anticipated boxing match.

Mayweather wore a fedora and gold rimmed glasses while McGregor sported a three-piece suit and tie and aviator sunglasses as they made separate appearances before a crowd of several hundred people in front of the arena where they will fight Saturday night.

The two got into an unplanned verbal confrontation as they moved between the outdoor stage and the arena, though it was brief. Bodyguards kept them apart and both fighters are smart enough not to do anything to jeopardize their immense paydays from what could be the richest fight ever.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs work,‚Äù Mayweather said when asked if he was having fun. ‚ÄúMy job is to be a fighter.‚Äù

McGregor, meanwhile, reiterated his vow to knock Mayweather out within two rounds, and claimed the boxer was getting desperate in making comments about his weight and stamina.

‚ÄúLet him keep praying about weight and fatigue. All he‚Äôs doing is praying,‚Äù McGregor said. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs praying to the new god of boxing.‚Äù

The crowd for one of the final promotional events was small and not terribly vocal, especially after waiting an hour or two in 100-degree heat to see the fighters. There was no one in line at T-Mobile Arena‚Äôs three ticket windows, where plenty of expensive tickets remain for the bout.

The big money for the two fighters will come from pay-per-view sales, and early indications are that it could break all records. Some 50 million people may watch in the United States alone, with millions more tuning in worldwide.

Estimates vary wildly, but Mayweather could pocket $200 million, while McGregor might make $100 million.

The promotion has been more circus-like than anything, but both boxers said they were serious about putting on an explosive show on fight night.

‚ÄúThis fight is not going to go the distance,‚Äù Mayweather said.

‚ÄúI believe I‚Äôll knock him out early, one or two rounds,‚Äù McGregor said.

Both fighters seemed relaxed and confident, just days away from a fight that seemed improbable at times and impossible at other times. Yet they will meet under boxing rules in a scheduled 12-round fight that matches a UFC champion who has never boxed professionally against the master defensive fighter of his time.

McGregor said it was just another progression in his fighting career, and chided Mayweather for saying he hopes the referee does his job and doesn‚Äôt allow McGregor to try any mixed martial arts moves against him.

‚ÄúI may make him beg me to follow the rules,‚Äù McGregor said.

Mayweather said he expected McGregor to come out wildly and use roughhouse tactics, something Marcos Maidana did effectively when he fought Mayweather in 2014. But he said the Irish fighter can‚Äôt keep that up for 12 rounds and doesn‚Äôt understand what it is to get hit by a real boxing champion.

‚ÄúWhen he gets hit he‚Äôll find out it‚Äôs totally different,‚Äù Mayweather said.

While looking as fit as ever and insisting he is taking the fight seriously, Mayweather said he will be doing meet-and-greet experiences every night living up to the fight at his new strip club just off the Las Vegas Strip.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be at the Girl Collection every day this week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEvery day.‚Äù

"I don‚Äôt like the word diet, says fitness expert Yasmin Karachiwala","‚Äù I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.‚Äù ‚Äù I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them.‚Äù

Celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala, who has trained the likes of Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt and Katrina Kaif, says she doesn‚Äôt like the word ‚Äúdiet‚Äù.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the word diet. I think we all are smart and making smart food choices is a lifestyle change. I only educate my clients on which food is good and we all know that fried, sweet and alcohol is bad so we should avoid them,‚Äù Karachiwala told IANS over e-mail. The celebrated fitness trainer, who has been roped in as the official fitness expert for sports and lifestyle brand Skechers, added: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recommend any diet‚Äù. Along with being a popular name in the fitness sector, Karachiwala, who owns a gym ‚Äî Body Image in the suburbs of Mumbai, is also the first BASI certified Pilates instructor in India and established the first Pilates studio.

Pilates is a system of exercises using special apparatus, designed to improve physical strength, flexibility and posture, and enhance mental awareness. Asked how Pilates is more beneficial than other forms of exercise, Karachiwala said: ‚ÄúPilates helps strengthen the core and works the body from the inside out. It helps prevent injuries. I suggest doing it along with any other exercise and see how it makes you perform that exercise even better.‚Äù

Being in the fitness industry for over two decades, Karachiwala has helped Bollywood big-wigs like Deepika, Katrina, Alia, Sonakshi Sinha, Malaika Arora Khan, Zareen Khan and more to achieve the perfect frame.

What‚Äôs the biggest challenge she faces while training a Bollywood personality?

‚ÄúI think to achieve different looks for a specific role is always a good challenge as if giving us an end goal. Challenges are good as it keeps you and your client motivated,‚Äù she said. Asked with whose transformation she was really proud of, Karachiwala replied: ‚ÄúAll my clients work extremely hard. It‚Äôs not easy with their schedules but they are all dedicated to their workouts and I‚Äôm proud of them.‚Äù

It is often said that Bollywood personalities take supplements to modify their body according to their roles in films. What do you have to say to that? Karachiwala replied: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in supplements as such I think naturally. If we eat healthy, our body can get most of its nutrients. Of course, sometimes vegetarians have a problem with protein so then a plant based protein shake is what I would suggest.‚Äù

Privacy is intrinsic to freedom of life and personal liberty: Supreme Court,"Indian citizens have a fundamental right to privacy, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday. (File) Indian citizens have a fundamental right to privacy, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday. (File)

Indian citizens have a fundamental right to privacy, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday. A nine-judge Constitution bench of the apex court was unanimous that privacy was part of fundamental rights guaranteed under part three of the Constitution. The nine judges overruled decisions in M P Sharma case and Kharak Singh case which had said right to privacy was not protected by Constitution. ‚ÄúThe decisions stand overruled‚Äù, it said.

The bench headed by Chief Justice of India J S Khehar and comprising Justices J Chelameswar, S A Bobde, R K Agrawal, R F Nariman, A M Sapre, D Y Chandrachud, S K Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer had reserved the verdict in the case on August 2 after hearing extensive arguments for six days.

The court said ‚Äúprivacy is intrinsic to freedom of life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of Constitution‚Äù. The apex court upholding privacy as a fundamental right has significant consequences for the common man as it will empower him/her with a powerful tool to fight unlawful intrusions by the state into their personal lives. But the very fact that the court has traced it to part 3 would mean that the restrictions applicable to other fundamental rights will also apply to privacy.

The judgement will also form the basis on which petitions challenging the Aadhaar Act will now proceed. The question whether citizens have a right to privacy had arisen during the hearing on petitions challenging Aadhaar and was referred to the nine-judge bench.

Belgian driver Stoffel Vandoorne will continue to race for struggling former world champions McLaren next season, the Formula One team announced on Wednesday ahead of his home race at Spa-Francorchamps.

The newcomer has scored just one point so far this season, with McLaren struggling to get strong performances from their Honda engine.

McLaren Racing Director Eric Boullier said the plan had always been for Vandoorne to continue as part of a multi-year deal.

‚ÄúThat plan hasn‚Äôt changed, and I‚Äôm very happy therefore to be able to confirm that he‚Äôll continue to race for us next season,‚Äù said the Frenchman.

‚ÄúLike all rookies, he‚Äôs had to learn a lot in the first half of his first Formula One season, but we have great confidence in him, and he‚Äôs getting better and better all the time.‚Äù

Supreme Court to hear PIL on protecting Jaypee home buyers on Thursday,"Around 30,000 buyers have booked their homes in 27 different housing projects of Jaypee Infratech and have been ‚Äúleft in the lurch as the insolvency proceedings have been started against it‚Äù, the senior lawyer said.

(Representational Image)

The Supreme Court will hear on Thursday a Public Interest Litigation seeking protection of interests of those who had invested in homes in the projects of debt-ridden realty firm Jaypee Infratech. The matter was mentioned for urgent hearing before a bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud on Wednesday. The court said ‚Äúwe will hear it tomorrow‚Äù.

Advocate Ajit Sinha, appearing for a home buyer, referred to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, and an order of the Allahabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal, and said even decrees in favour of home buyers cannot be executed once insolvency proceedings begin. The plea requested the court to direct the Centre and others that the Code ‚Äúshall not curtail the legal statutory and vested rights of flat owners/buyers as consumers‚Äù defined under the Consumer Protection Act.

‚ÄúThe actions as have been taken under the Code have led to a situation wherein the lifelong savings of the flat owners will go to waste with no prospects of them recovering the same, if their interests are not saved by this court,‚Äù the petition said.

The PIL said that alternatively, a direction may be issued to the government that flat owners/buyers be declared a secured creditor. Around 30,000 buyers have booked their homes in 27 different housing projects of Jaypee Infratech and have been ‚Äúleft in the lurch as the insolvency proceedings have been started against it‚Äù, the senior lawyer said.

"Trump ‚Äòvery committed‚Äô to Mideast peace, says envoy Kushner","US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

US President Donald Trump remains ‚Äúvery committed‚Äù to achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace, his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the start of talks on Thursday. But there was little to suggest any breakthrough or significant progress towards ending a decades-old conflict is imminent as Kushner began a day of separate meetings with Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

Palestinians were still seeking a pledge of support from the Trump administration for the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel ‚Äì the foundation of U.S. Middle East policy for the past two decades. The last round of peace talks between the two sides collapsed in 2014.

For his part, Netanyahu faces pressure from right-wing coalition partners not to give ground on Jewish settlement building in occupied territory that Palestinians seek for a independent state. The settlement issue contributed to the breakdown of negotiations three years ago. ‚ÄúWe have things to talk about ‚Äì how to advance peace, stability and security in our region, prosperity too. And I think that all of them are within our reach,‚Äù Netanyahu, welcoming Kushner to his Tel Aviv office, said in a video clip released by the U.S. Embassy.

Kushner, a 36-year-old real estate developer with little experience of international diplomacy or political negotiation, arrived in Israel with U.S. Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt on Wednesday after meeting Arab leaders in the Gulf, Egypt and Jordan. ‚ÄúThe president is very committed to achieving a solution here that will be able to bring prosperity and peace to all people in this area,‚Äù Kushner, who was tasked by Trump to help broker a peace deal, said in his response to Netanyahu.

‚ÄúULTIMATE DEAL‚Äù

Trump has described peace between Israelis and Palestinians as ‚Äúthe ultimate deal‚Äù ‚Äì and added a new wrinkle last February by saying he was not fixed on two states co-existing side by side as a solution to their dispute.

In the West Bank, Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Abbas, said Kushner‚Äôs visit ‚Äì he last travelled to Israel and the Palestinian territories in June ‚Äì could prove significant, particularly because of the envoy‚Äôs consultations with regional allies this week.

‚ÄúThis may create a new chance to reach a settlement based on the two-state solution and the Arab initiative and stop the current deterioration of the peace process.‚Äù Abu Rdainah was referring to a 2002 Arab League initiative that offers Israel diplomatic recognition from Arab countries in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and a full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in a 1967 war.

Netanyahu has expressed tentative support for parts of the blueprint, but there are many caveats on the Israeli side, including how to resolve the complex Palestinian refugee issue.

Painting a pessimistic picture, Mahmoud al-Aloul, the second-ranking official in Abbas‚Äô Fatah movement, accused U.S. negotiators of focusing in their talks with the president on ‚ÄúIsraeli lies‚Äù about Palestinian incitement to violence and ignoring what he described as fundamental statehood issues. ‚ÄúI do not think the American envoys are coming carrying anything ‚Äì nothing at all,‚Äù he told reporters.

Infosys co-founder and former chief executive Nandan Nilekani has been appointed as the Chairman of Infosys on Thursday, days after Vishal Sikka resigned from the post of CEO, MD. The Infosys board has been mired in a dispute for several months now, with company‚Äôs founders, led by former Chairman Narayana Murthy, accusing the directors of the company for lapse in governance.

After joining Infosys as Chairman, Nilekani said: ‚ÄúI am happy to return to Infosys, now in the role of non-executive chairman, and look forward to working with my colleagues on the Board and in executive management on the business opportunities we see before us and delivering benefits to our clients, shareholders, employees and communities. I thank Vishal for his service as the CEO of Infosys over the last 3 years and wish him well in his future endeavours.‚Äù Also Read: Nandan Nilekani appointed as Infosys Chairman, Vishal Sikka quits board, Seshasayee steps down

Nilekani, who is also former UIDAI chairman, had enjoyed a relatively successful career at Infosys. The company grew several fold during his tenure as the CEO from March 2002 till April 2007. After his exit from Infosys in 2009, Nilekani accepted former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh‚Äôs invitation to spearhead the implementation of the Unique Identification Authority of India project pan India. UIDAI was clearly aimed at providing citizens of India with a unique identification number.

Nilekani also co-founded NASSCOM as well as the Bengaluru chapter of The IndUS Entrepreneurs (TiE). He is also the president of National Council of Applied Economic Research, one of India‚Äôs largest and oldest economic research institute. Besides, he is also a member of the board of governors of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER).

Nilekani‚Äôs performance on the political front has, however, been dismal. He joined the Congress party in 2014 during the Lok Sabha election and contested from the Bangalore South constituency. But he lost with a huge margin. This was Nilekani‚Äôs maiden election. He was also the richest candidate in fray for the 16th Lok Sabha election. After he lost the election, Nilekani said: ‚ÄúI concede defeat and congratulate Ananth Kumar for his performance in this poll. I will continue to work more for the city and the Congress party.‚Äù When he was asked what went wrong for him, he said he was happy with the campaign he ran and the way his supporters and Congress leaders work along with him on the campaign.

An alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Nilekani was also bestowed with the title‚Äô ‚ÄòAsia‚Äôs Businessman of the Year‚Äô in 2003 by Fortune Magazine. Aside from this, he was also named ‚ÄòCorporate Citizen of the Year‚Äô at the Asia Business Leaders Award that took place in 2004 and received the coveted Joseph Schumpeter prize for innovative services in economy, economic sciences, and politics in 2005.

He was also conferred with the Padma Bhushan in 2006, India‚Äôs highest civilian honour. While Forbes Asia named his ‚ÄòBusinessman of the Year‚Äô in 2006, the iconic Time magazine listed his name in one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2006 and 2009.

Sweet shops down shutters as part of day-long strike to protest 5 per cent GST,"A shut K C Das at Esplanade in Kolkata on Monday. (Express photo by Partha Paul) A shut K C Das at Esplanade in Kolkata on Monday. (Express photo by Partha Paul)

Lakhs of sweet shops across the state remained shut on Monday, following a 24-hour strike called by Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsayee Samiti, demanding the rollback of the 5 per cent Goods and Service Tax (GST) on sweets. ‚ÄúWe have received immense response from sweet sellers across the state. Almost all sweet shops downed their shutters. We do not have the infrastructure to cope up with the new tax regime. Government kept paneer and other perishable items out of GST but imposed 5 per cent GST on sweets,‚Äù said Jagannath Ghosh, the Joint Secretary of Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsayee Samiti, Kolkata unit.

‚ÄúIt is not possible for sweet sellers to file so many returns. They (Centre) have kept two schemes for us. In one scheme, tax return has to be filed quarterly, and in another we need to file tax return 38 times in one year. We want the government to rollback its decision and keep sweets industry out of GST,‚Äù said Ghosh.

According to sweet sellers, the sweets industry registers over Rs 1,000 crore turnover annually, and has about 10 lakh employees. In one day‚Äôs strike, the industry would incur a loss of Rs 10 lakh, they said. According to Ghosh, sweet sellers also plan to intensify their protest and sit for a relay hunger strike from August 24 to September 26.

‚ÄúWe have paid VAT on raw materials, but there has been no tax on sweets, and we want the government to understand the core matters of our industry. Those who sell sweets are not computer-friendly, and it is a headache for them to file tax returns. Is it possible to give a printed bill to each customer for one rosogulla or one sandesh?‚Äù asked a sweet seller.

GST on sweets will also increase cost of the product, which will be an extra burden for customers. ‚ÄúHere in Bengal, we don‚Äôt need occasions to buy sweets. Having sweets is like a daily affair for us. An increase in its cost will definitely affect us,‚Äù said Rita Bhattacharya, a housewife. Most of the sweet shops in the state don‚Äôt issue bills to their customers. They sell sweets and pay VAT on raw materials. There has been no tax on sweets for many years. ‚ÄúWith GST, we have to keep track of number of items sold and issue bills, for which we need a computer and someone to operate it. The infrastructure we require to pay GST is costly,‚Äù added Ram Babu, a sweet shop owner at VIP Road who has been running his shop for the last 20 years.

"Car depot at Aarey Milk Colony: Despite CMO clarification, Sanjay Nirupam sticks to allegations","Sanjay Nirupam (File Photo) Sanjay Nirupam (File Photo)

The war of words between Mumbai Congress president Sanjay Nirupam and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis over construction of a Metro car shed in Aarey Milk Colony continued on Wednesday as Nirupam stood by his allegations, holding the chief minister responsible for an alleged Rs 18,000 crore scam. Fadnavis, meanwhile, issued a statement defending the project. Reiterating that the construction of the carshed at Aarey is a pretext for real estate development, Nirupam accused Fadnavis of supporting the builder mafia.

Referring to the points raised in the CM‚Äôs statement, Nirupam pointed out that Fadnavis‚Äô claim that Aarey will not be used for commercial use or for real estate development was contradictory to the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited‚Äôs design documents which show that 30,000 sq m will be ‚Äò‚Äúcommercially exploited‚Äù. ‚ÄúOther documents like MMRCL‚Äôs letter to the collector dated December 16, 2015 clearly state that they would like to use the land for development of real estate. Even in their advertisement, MMRCL has said that they would like to use the land at Aarey for commercial purposes. The MMRCL has also requested the Urban Development department to change the land use of the additional 3 hectares to commercial zone clearly showing their intentions of using it for real estate purposes,‚Äù alleged Nirupam.

Nirupam also rubbished Fadnavis‚Äô claims that Aarey colony is not part of the forest land and pointed out that a letter sent by the collector in September last in which MMRCL has been instructed to seek permission of forest and environment dept before building the carshed indicated that the land is under the forest department. ‚ÄúApart from the collector‚Äôs letter, documents procured under the RTI citing the legal position of Sanjay Gandhi National Park in 1980 shows that the forest department owns 2076 sq km of revenue land which includes Aarey Milk Colony indicating that its a part of SGNP,‚Äù he said.

On the CMO pointing out that permission to acquire land at Aarey colony had been given by former Congress chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, Nirupam said the BJP government has used facts in a selective and convenient manner.

‚ÄúPrithviraj Chavan‚Äôs government had given two options, Aarey colony and Mahalaxmi Racecourse. But Fadnavis‚Äô government picked Aarey colony since they know that other options in Colaba, Kalina, Mahalaxmi Racecourse and Kanjur Marg all fall under CRZ norms,‚Äù he said.

President Donald Trump voices mild optimism about ties with North Korea,"US President Donald Trump (Source: AP) US President Donald Trump (Source: AP)

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday expressed his cautious optimism that his aggressive stance against North Korea was paying off and that there was room for improvement in relations with North Korea after months of mounting tension over its weapons programs. ‚ÄúI respect the fact that he is starting to respect us,‚Äù Trump said of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un

‚ÄúAnd maybe ‚Äì probably not, but maybe ‚Äì something positive can come about,‚Äù he said at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona.

Trump‚Äôs comments echoed that of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had earlier in the day extended a olive leaf to North Korea, while welcoming what he called the restraint it had shown in the past few days with regarding its weapons programs and saying he hoped a path could be opening for dialogue ‚Äúsometime in the near future.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have had no missile launches or provocative acts on the part of North Korea since the unanimous adoption of the UN Security Council resolution,‚Äù Tillerson had told reporters, while referring to UN sanctions on North Korea agreed on August 5.

North Korea had last tested a Intercontinental Missile on July 28, which put US within striking distance of its nuclear weapons. This had sparked off tension between Pyongyang and West.

US President Donald Trump consequently warned North Korea that it would face ‚Äúfire and fury‚Äù if it threatened the United States.

Pyongyang had responded by threatening to fire missiles at US Pacific island territory of Guam, but later said it was holding off such attacks and see what what US did next.

Morocco: Sexual assault video of woman on bus sparks outrage,"While the video sparked widespread condemnation, some accused the woman of having ‚Äúprovoked the men with indecent clothing‚Äù. (Representational) While the video sparked widespread condemnation, some accused the woman of having ‚Äúprovoked the men with indecent clothing‚Äù. (Representational)

A video of a young woman being sexually assaulted by a gang of teenage boys on a bus in Casablanca has sparked outrage in Morocco, reigniting a bitter debate about violence against women in the Muslim country. The video, which was posted on social media on Sunday, shows four boys sexually molesting a woman while laughing, tearing her clothes off and insulting her in Arabic.

The woman ‚Äì who the authorities said had learning difficulties ‚Äì is seen in tears, crying for help, while neither the bus driver nor any of the passengers intervene. Sexual harassment and abuse of women is rife in Morocco where a national survey found that nearly two-thirds of women had experienced physical, psychological, sexual or economic abuse. Earlier in August a video showing a mob of men hounding a young woman on a street in Tangier caused uproar in the media.

On Monday the Moroccan authorities said they had arrested six boys aged 15 to 17 for their ‚Äúpresumed implication in the woman‚Äôs aggression‚Äù and put them under investigation. While the video sparked widespread condemnation on social and local media, some users accused the woman of having ‚Äúprovoked the men with indecent clothing‚Äù. One man wrote on Facebook that ‚ÄúI condemn the act but cover yourselves up, this one was easy to undress.‚Äù

Moroccan charity Don‚Äôt Touch My Child called for any witnesses to come forward ‚Äúto bring to justice this barbaric horde who shamefully attacked a young women‚Äù. Public transport company M‚ÄôDina Bus condemned the incident and said it was collaborating with authorities in the north African kingdom, which is trying to attract investors and tourists by presenting itself as a safe haven.

The way back home: Will we ever be the India that was envisioned?,"The eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it. The eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it.

Reena Kallat Synapse, Single channel video projection, 2011

Studies say that the eye sees objects in the manner in which the mind interprets it and no two people see anything exactly alike. We create meaning through a mental bridge that the mind forms to complete gaps.

My video Synapse is an ironic play on legibility, where we witness 14 individuals‚Äô attempts at reading the letters on a Snellen chart at an ophthalmologist‚Äôs clinic. The traditional Snellen (eye chart), meant to measure visual acuity, in this case happens to have been replaced by a variation comprising the fragmented letters of the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, which commences with ‚ÄúWe the people of India‚Ä¶‚Äù Each person tries to make sense of the alphabets before them with hesitations and uncertainties, interrupted recurrently with change of lenses and monotonous questions regarding clarity of vision. Their pauses seem less about the limitations of their vision, and, instead, appear to metaphorically demonstrate an ordinary citizen‚Äôs blurred view of the most inclusive document of the nation.

Some of these ideas have preoccupied me for years and I‚Äôve made several works that refer to the Preamble of the Constitution of India to examine our role as citizens vis-a-vis the republic. Through this video I made in 2011, I reflect upon our own limitations in understanding our responsibilities that come along with the freedom promised through the Constitution and how we choose to interpret it. Nearly 70 years after the fundamental principles of the Constitution were first laid down, we are far from having achieved these values. Fulfilling these can, perhaps, only be made possible if we collectively strive towards attaining them rather than allowing ourselves to be divided as a people, by being fooled into believing that these would be provided for.

Samit Das, Bibliography in Progress, 2016

History depends on archaeology and its excavation, on myths and archives. For a long time now, I have been looking at history not just as an unchangeable culture or a particular person‚Äôs assumption/ studies, but as a documentation of the growth process of society through a contemporary approach. History should be open for everyone to understand and interpret.

It is the same with art. One cannot be contemporary if one denies history. In the series ‚ÄòBibliography in Progress‚Äô, I have looked at the Harappan civilization and I am working with images from the Constitution of India for another set. I attained a copy of the Illustrated Constitution published in 2000/2001, and am looking at the illustrations done by Nandalal Bose and his students. It is difficult to say if we are the India that our Constitution promised ‚Äî there are various dimensions, and, something might be right according to one person and wrong according to other. All of these point to a multi-layered thought process intrinsic to a democracy.

Venkat Shyam, Freedom, acrylic on canvas, 2016

We have a long way to go before we become the India that was envisioned, where everyone is equal and enjoys liberty and justice. This particular work discusses gender equality and shows a woman walking hand-in-hand with a man. We speak of equality between men and women, but that is hardly a reality. A woman has to carry the burden of household responsibilities, despite whatever work she does outside her home. In this image, she has the globe inside her, representing the universe, but also a scorpion crawling on her, depicting her daily struggles.

LN Tallur, Eraser Pro, bronze, 2012

We are living in times when personal greed is overtaking the ideas that our society was built on. This erasure is, of course, incomplete, dependent as it is on the demands of that hour. For instance, we save things on the computer, but when we want to remove the data from the hard disk, maintaining privacy is not as simple as it may have seemed at first. The first thought is that when you ‚Äúdelete‚Äù the file, the data is gone. Not quite ‚Äî it only removes the reference of the file from the file system table. The file remains on the disk and can be retrieved. Similarly, we are aware of the values and principles that we have inherited, but are choosing to ignore them.

Riyas Komu, Fourth World, terracotta installation, 2017

The Lion Capital from the Buddhist tradition is one of the best images any nation can have to represent its diversity, multiculturalism and secularism. It represents the four dimensions that India as a country has always upheld, and that is something I have always enjoyed in the symbolism.

We are getting a feeling that this symbolism is crumbling. The four dimensions represent the ‚Äúunity in diversity‚Äù that our Constitution enshrines. Though we do not see the fourth dimension, its presence is there, always unified with the other three and that was the strength of this republic. Conceptually, when this unity breaks, when we are no longer able to rely on the unseen fourth dimension, that‚Äôs when the anxieties of the State, and political and administrative processes surface. We‚Äôre excluded from these, making it easier for power structures to erase cultural differences and instill ideas of homogenisation in its citizens.

Government puts common engineering entrance test move on hold,"CBSE conducts JEE Main every year CBSE conducts JEE Main every year

The Human Resource Development Ministry has decided to junk the plan of introducing a common engineering entrance exam like NEET from next year. In March, the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), had announced that from 2018, the government will introduce a national-level common entrance examination for government colleges. This regulation was opposed by the representatives of West Bengal and Tamil Nadu government.

However, the Ministry had decided to put the idea on hold for reviewing the success of the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) for admission into medical colleges, before moving ahead. ‚ÄúIt has been decided that there will be no common engineering exam next year. However, the idea has not been completely discarded. The AICTE will submit a report about feasibility of conducting the exam in future,‚Äù a senior official said.

At present the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducts Joint Entrance Examination (Mains) for admission to in IITs, NITs and other engineering colleges. Over 11 lakh students appear for it every year.

Besides, many state boards have their own entrance examinations for admissions in government and private colleges. Some states also grant admission based on marks of the Class 12 board exams.

There are over 3,300 approved engineering colleges in the country affiliated to universities, with an annual intake of around 16 lakh students.

FC Barcelona to sue Neymar for 8.5 million euros,"Neymar recently moved from Barcelona to PSG. (Source: AP) Neymar recently moved from Barcelona to PSG. (Source: AP)

Barcelona are suing Neymar for 8.5 million euros ($10.00 million) for breach of contract as they want him to return the bonus he was paid when he signed a new five-year deal just nine months before joining Paris St Germain, the Spanish club said on Tuesday.

The Catalans are asking for an additional 10 percent payment due to a delay in their demands being met.

‚ÄúBarcelona have taken these actions in defence of their interests, after Neymar‚Äôs contract was rescinded just a few months after he signed on until 2021,‚Äù a club statement said.

Brazilian striker Neymar, who joined PSG earlier this month after the French club triggered his 222 million euros release clause, said he was surprised by the decision but warned he was not going to give in.

‚ÄúIt is noteworthy that this news was received with surprise, since the athlete completely fulfilled the contract then in force, with the full deposit of the amounts set out in the buy-out clause freely agreed with F.C. Barcelona for his release,‚Äù Neymar‚Äôs representatives said in a statement.

The statement added that the 25-year-old forward‚Äôs lawyers were preparing a formal defence to the demands.

PSG activated Neymar‚Äôs release clause as Barcelona were unwilling to negotiate the sale of one of their best players.

Barcelona have passed the complaint to the Spanish football federation (RFEF) after first filing the lawsuit in court, as well as demanding PSG subsidise it, should Neymar not be able to take responsibility for it.

PSG brushed off that suggestion and said they had done all that was required of them.

‚ÄúParis Saint-Germain reiterates that, like Neymar Jr., it has always respected all applicable laws and rules in its dealings and, once again, regrets the attitude of FC Barcelona,‚Äù the club said in a statement.

In the days after he signed for the French club, Barcelona refused to pay the reported 26 million euro instalment of the loyalty bonus which he was due to receive this summer, citing breach of contract.

On Sunday, Neymar criticised the Barcelona board after helping PSG beat Toulouse in Ligue 1.

‚ÄúI am disappointed with them (Barcelona directors). I spent four very happy years there and left happy, but not with them. For me they shouldn‚Äôt be in charge of Barcelona. Barca deserve much better and everyone knows this,‚Äù Neymar said.

"Water clean-up project: China launches 8,000 plants worth $100 bn","Large amounts of China‚Äôs water have been rendered unusable as a result of poorly regulated industrial expansion, overmining and the uncontrolled use of pesticides and fertilisers. Representational Photo/Reuters Large amounts of China‚Äôs water have been rendered unusable as a result of poorly regulated industrial expansion, overmining and the uncontrolled use of pesticides and fertilisers. Representational Photo/Reuters

China launched nearly 8,000 water clean-up projects in the first half of 2017 with projected total investment of 667.4 billion yuan ($100 billion), the environment ministry said on Thursday.

The projects were devised as part of a 2015 action plan to treat and prevent water pollution, and cover 325 contaminated groundwater sites across the country, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) said in a notice.

A total of 343 contaminated sites had been identified, meaning that 95 percent had drawn up plans to bring water quality up to required standards, it said.

However, it noted that some regions were still behind schedule when it came to meeting their 2017 water pollution goals.

Large amounts of China‚Äôs water have been rendered unusable as a result of poorly regulated industrial expansion, overmining and the uncontrolled use of pesticides and fertilisers.

With China desperate to increase supplies to guarantee future food and energy security, it promised in 2015 to make significant improvements in its major waterways and curb untreated wastewater from highly polluting sectors like mining, steelmaking, textiles, printing and oil refining.

The MEP said this month that overall water quality had improved in the first half of 2017, although some regions registered an increase in substandard samples over the period.

China grades its water in six bands, with the lowest ‚Äúbelow grade 5‚Äù considered unusable even for industrial or irrigation purposes and described as ‚Äúblack and stinky‚Äù water.

Of 2,100 ‚Äúblack and stinky‚Äù sites identified, 44.1 percent had completed treatment projects in the first half of the year, the ministry said, noting that the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning and Anhui had fallen behind.

In a bid to protect rural water supplies, China also identified 636,000 square kilometres (246,000 square miles) of land that would be made off limits to animal husbandry, and it shut 213,000 livestock and poultry farms in the first six months.

The ministry also said 809 new household sewage treatment facilities were built in the first half, but the regions of Tianjin, Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Xinjiang, Hubei and Guangdong were behind schedule, it said.

China said on Wednesday that it has already appointed 200,000 ‚Äúriver chiefs‚Äù throughout the country as part of a new system aimed at making local officials more accountable when it comes to improving water quality and curbing pollution.

"Triple Talaq Verdict: ‚ÄòThere is hope now, many will get courage to fight‚Äô","Habiba Qureshi, who has challenged triple talaq, outside Vadodara court, Tuesday. (Express Photo/Bhupendra Rana) Habiba Qureshi, who has challenged triple talaq, outside Vadodara court, Tuesday. (Express Photo/Bhupendra Rana)

Habiba Qureshi was all smile on Tuesday after she learnt about the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to put a stay on instant triple talaq. The 28-year-old has been fighting a legal battle since March this year after her husband of eight years divorced her by uttering talaq three times in one go. ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court verdict has come as a hope for many Muslim women who have suffered the agony of triple talaq. Many of my friends and family members have bore the brunt of it. With this verdict, many women will find the courage to fight,‚Äù says Habiba, who has filed a petition in the family court, challenging the instant triple talaq given to her.

Seeking restoration of her conjugal rights, Habiba in her petition has stated: ‚ÄúThe respondent (Haroon) has uttered the words ‚Äòtalaq, talaq, talaq‚Äô in one go, in a fit of rage and therefore it is invalid as per the Sharia law in Islam. The talaq was given on provocation of the respondent‚Äôs family. The respondent has not provided for the maintenance of the petitioner nor made arrangements for her accommodation and food. Therefore, I pray that this talaq be declared invalid, the marriage be restored to be considered as valid as if the talaq has not been pronounced, and restore my conjugal rights in this marriage.‚Äù

For Habiba, the eight years of her marriage with Haroon was seeped in agony. ‚ÄúI have suffered mental and physical abuse from my in-laws. My mother-in-law left no stone unturned to make my life a living hell by provoking my husband to chastise me. It had totally shaken my confidence,‚Äù says the mother of a seven-year-old boy. According to Habiba, her brother and sister supported her decision to file a case against triple talaq.

Terming her legal battle as a ‚Äúfight for dignity,‚Äù Habiba, who is also a painter, says: ‚ÄúI am doing this for my son, Hamza‚Äù. Her husband, who sells chicken, has allegedly not allowed her to meet her son. ‚ÄúIf he (Haroon) promises to keep me well, I will also return to him. For us Muslim women, living alone is not an option yet‚Ä¶ I do have fleeting thoughts about standing on my own feet, but my community members and family tell me that women in our community cannot live alone,‚Äù says Habiba who has warded off suggestions from her family and friends to marry an ‚Äòolder man‚Äô and forget her past life, including her son. ‚ÄúHow can I forget my son? People have been bringing in proposals to marry older men, who are fathers to grown-up children; in some cases they have adult children. They tell me that these are the only men from whom I will now get marriage proposals. But, I am only 28,‚Äù she adds.

According to Habiba‚Äôs advocate, the Supreme Court verdict will have a direct impact on her case. ‚ÄúThe next hearing in her case is slated for September 14, where we will cite the apex court‚Äôs judgment. It will certainly help us in restoring Habiba‚Äôs marriage to Haroon. We will also urge the court to take an undertaking from him about keeping her well and unharmed,‚Äù said advocate Neeraj Jain. According to him, Habiba‚Äôs case against triple talaq is a rare one ‚Äúas most of them turn to maulvis to settle their marital disputes‚Äù.

As Habiba leaves court, she signs off saying: ‚ÄúI know Allah is with me.‚Äù

"Recruitment of around 9,000 teachers in Delhi government schools put on hold","Lt Governor Anil Baijal (File) Lt Governor Anil Baijal (File)

The recruitment of around 9,000 teachers to the city‚Äôs government schools has been put on hold by Lt Governor Anil Baijal, following the AAP government‚Äôs insistence that the work experience of guest teachers be given weightage in the process. The decision comes a day before the candidates could start applying online for the posts advertised by the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) on August 7.

Officials in the Lt Governor‚Äôs office confirmed the development. Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had written to Lt Governor Anil Baijal while the Delhi Assembly had passed a resolution on August 10 demanding that the recruitment process be halted till the education department formulates a policy to give weightage to guest teachers.

The DSSSB today issued a notice, following requests from the Directorate of Education to put the process on abeyance till further instructions, that the advertised vacancies are being withdrawn. ‚ÄúOn appeal from Delhi govt and Delhi Assembly, LtGov Delhi holds teacher recruitment. Am sure Guest Teachers regularization will get justice now,‚Äù Sisodia tweeted, with a copy of the notice.

The AAP government has been insisting that the work experience of around 17,000 guest teachers employed in Delhi government schools be given weightage in the recruitment process of DSSSB. Back in 2016, the government had passed a Cabinet proposal to this effect and had sent it to then Lt Governor Najeeb Jung for his approval. But the proposal was not approved.

It was decided that the guest teachers will be provided age-relaxation. The subject of services come under the jurisdiction of the Lt Governor.

Sisodia argued that two recent Supreme Court judgements had made it clear that work experience can be given weightage, thus overturning the Uma Devi judgement which was cited by the L-G in red-flagging the government‚Äôs proposal. The salary structure of the guest teachers was hiked in March.

"Sub-categorisation OF OBCs: Congress guarded, M Veerappa Moily says his govt did it in Karnataka","Former Law Minister M Veerappa Moily Former Law Minister M Veerappa Moily

While the Congress on Wednesday appeared guarded in its reaction to the NDA government‚Äôs decision to set up a commission with an aim to examine the issue of sub-categorisation of Sub-CATEGORISATION OF OBCs: Congress guarded, Moily says his govt did it in Karnataka.

Other Backward Classes (OBCs), former Law Minister M Veerappa Moily welcomed the move. Moily said the UPA government, while commissioning the socioeconomic and caste census, had sub-categorisation in mind. The Congress has been guarded since its leaders feel it is a political move by the Narendra Modi government, and could help deepen the BJP‚Äôs appeal among people from the hitherto neglected extremely backward castes. The Congress cannot afford to oppose the move either, as Karnataka was among the many states that had carried out sub-categorisation back in the 1990s under a Congress government.

The Congress can also be in a fix as the NDA government‚Äôs move could raise the hackles of regional parties in the Opposition such as the RJD, Samajwadi Party and the JD(S), which derive their support from among dominant castes within the OBCs. According to party leaders, the Congress will have to walk a tightrope on the issue and not antagonise these regional forces.

‚ÄúWe had done that in Karnataka,‚Äù Moily told The Indian Express on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWhen I was the chief minister, we had appointed a commission under Justice Chinnappa Reddy. On the basis of the commission‚Äôs report the Karnataka government took a decision on sub-categorisation, and that has worked out perfectly. (It was) even upheld in court.‚Äù

He said the Karnataka government had also given 4 per cent reservation to Muslims. The Congress‚Äôs communications department head Randeep Surjewala said that on the issue of reservation within reservation, the party would ‚Äúlike to study that notification in detail and then make (a) detailed comment.‚Äù Surjewala, however, pointed out that 27 per cent reservation for OBCs was introduced under a Congress-led government (in 2006).

Arsenal failings exposed in ‚ÄòBig Six‚Äô matches,"Arsene Wenger‚Äôs side have not won at Anfield since 2012. (Source: Reuters) Arsene Wenger‚Äôs side have not won at Anfield since 2012. (Source: Reuters)

Arsenal head to Anfield on Sunday seeking to improve their poor recent record against other ‚ÄòBig Six‚Äô teams amid growing uncertainty surrounding their most creative players, Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

Arsene Wenger‚Äôs side have not won at Anfield since 2012, since when they have played 50 matches against their major rivals, only winning 11, drawing 19 and losing 20. Away from home, they have just won two of 24 games at Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City and United.

Anfield also was the scene for one of their greatest humiliations when a vibrant Liverpool side thrashed them 5-1 in 2014, ripping them apart with four goals in the first 20 minutes.

The contrast between their recent failures and that last victory in September 2012, when two of their summer signings, Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla, scored the goals, could not be more stark with Wenger again this week bemoaning the state of the transfer market as he seeks to add to his summer business.

Wenger needs to sell before he can buy long-term target Monaco winger Thomas Lemar and has described his 33-man squad as ‚Äúunmanageable‚Äù. But, in a familiar refrain, he this week lamented the market difficulties experienced by English clubs.

‚ÄúThere is no transfer market anymore because the price depends only on the identity of the buyer and when you are English, you have straight away 50 per cent on the price of a player and that makes it difficult to act,‚Äù said Wenger.

His failure to offload any underperformers, given the disappointment of last season when Arsenal failed to qualify for the Champions League, has surprised respected Irish commentator Johnnie Giles, the former Leeds United midfielder.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been a great fan of Wenger and I think he has done a great job with Arsenal over the years ‚Äì I think everybody agrees with that,‚Äù said Giles on Eamon Dunphy‚Äôs The Stand podcast.

‚ÄúBut when you have Ozil in the team, again, and Chamberlain in the team, again, Walcott still there, Xhaka ‚Äî these are proven failures, and why they are there, I don‚Äôt know. I think it will be the end of Wenger. ‚ÄúI thought they would be out, start from scratch, good players in, or better than he has. These are proven failures and why he is sticking with them, I do not know.‚Äù

Not everyone agrees with that assessment, particularly of Oxlade-Chamberlain, who Wenger insists is not for sale despite interest from Chelsea and Liverpool.

With Sanchez also linked with a move to Manchester City, there could be several ins and outs ahead of next week‚Äôs transfer deadline.

Before then, Wenger will be desperate for some reward at Anfield, his favourite English stadium, on Sunday after last week‚Äôs defeat at Stoke City.

Laurent Koscielny is free to return after missing the first two games through suspension. His presence should bolster a defence that has conceded four goals in two games.

Sanchez is also expected to be in contention after missing the opening games with an abdominal strain.

World Bank raises Thailand 2017 growth forecast to 3.5 per cent,"Thailand‚Äôs economy expanded a better than expected 3.7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, prompting the state planning agency to raise its 2017 growth projection to 3.5-4.0 per cent from a range of 3.3-3.8 per cent. Thailand‚Äôs economy expanded a better than expected 3.7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, prompting the state planning agency to raise its 2017 growth projection to 3.5-4.0 per cent from a range of 3.3-3.8 per cent.

Thailand‚Äôs economy is expected to grow 3.5 per cent this year, up from 3.2 per cent initially predicted in April, and rising to 3.6 percent next year, the World Bank said on Thursday.

Southeast Asia‚Äôs second-largest economy is gaining momentum as farm incomes recover from drought, merchandise and tourism exports rise and fiscal stimulus continues, the World Bank said in a statement.

In April, it predicted 2018 GDP growth of 3.3 per cent for Thailand.

‚ÄúThailand has the potential to raise growth to above 4 per cent by addressing structural bottlenecks ‚Äì education equality, services liberalisation and public infrastructure management,‚Äù it said.

However, risks to the economic recovery include political uncertainty, if reforms and elections become postponed, while a deterioration in the global environment, including increased trade protectionism and a slowdown in the Chinese economy may impede Thailand‚Äôs export momentum and private investment recovery, the international lender said.

"I copped a bit of heat stroke on the first day of training in Bangladesh, says Glenn Maxwell","Glenn Maxwell is already facing the heat in Bangladesh. (Source: Reuters) Glenn Maxwell is already facing the heat in Bangladesh. (Source: Reuters)

Australia will be squaring-off against Bangladesh for the first Test at Dhaka. Incidentally, this is the first time in 11 years that Australia will be playing a Test in Bangladesh. Hence, most of the Aussie players are inexperienced with the testing conditions. Hard-hitting batsman Glenn Maxwell, who is touring Bangladesh for the first time to play a Test, is already facing the heat as he revealed that he had a bout of heatstroke after a grueling net session.

‚ÄúI copped a bit of heat stroke on the first day, which wasn‚Äôt a good start. I think just doing some running outside then had to go inside to do some fitness testing, and then going back outside (to train) didn‚Äôt help too much. Basically, my body shut down a little bit but I was fine after a bit of an ice bath and plenty of fluids.‚Äù, Maxwell said and added, ‚ÄúWith the morning rain and the overnight rain, I think all the moisture‚Äôs coming out of the ground and making it quite sweaty work for us. But it‚Äôs been good, we‚Äôve got a lot out of the last few days, basically putting the finishing touches for day one.‚Äù

Speaking on the kinds of wickets that will be available in the Bangladesh, Maxwell said,‚ÄùAs we showed in India, we probably prefer those wickets where the ball beats our defence and we‚Äôre able to sort of just play the line and added, ‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs spinning big consistently, you can hold your defence and you can trust that the ball‚Äôs going to miss the outside edge. We put extreme conditions in (place for) Darwin with the wickets, where we made them ridiculously tough to bat on and guys tested themselves really well during that week.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe wickets were perfect. Even coming here and having a couple of hits on these wickets, it‚Äôs very similar to what we were facing in Darwin, if not a little bit easier I suppose in the nets. ‚ÄúI think the guys are more than well-equipped to handle whatever comes at us in this first Test.‚Äù, he concluded.

Ousmane Dembele chaos continues as Borussia Dortmund face Hertha Berlin,"Dembele‚Äôs behaviour has even irked some of his Dortmund team mates with Nuri Sahin saying should the player return to the fold, there would be discussions with him. (Source: AP) Dembele‚Äôs behaviour has even irked some of his Dortmund team mates with Nuri Sahin saying should the player return to the fold, there would be discussions with him. (Source: AP)

Borussia Dortmund has been mired in one of the longest and ugliest transfer sagas in recent seasons with talented Ousmane Dembele at the centre of the storm as the Bundesliga heavyweights face Hertha Berlin on Saturday.

The hugely talented 20-year-old France winger has been forcing a transfer to Barcelona for several weeks and has been suspended by Dortmund after missing training earlier this month.

Dembele, who has a contract to 2021, sat out their German Cup first round as well as last Saturday‚Äôs Bundesliga opener ‚Äì a 3-0 victory at VfL Wolfsburg ‚Äì while the Ruhr valley club rejected a first offer for the player from Barcelona.

Dembele‚Äôs behaviour has even irked some of his Dortmund team mates with Nuri Sahin saying should the player return to the fold, there would be discussions with him.

‚ÄúWe need him,‚Äù midfielder Sahin said this week. ‚ÄúBut the boy is 20 years old and he is not doing everything right at the moment.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe will also talk to him and tell him our opinion when he comes back.‚Äù

Last season‚Äôs German Cup winners, who finished third in the Bundesliga and will play in the Champions League group stage, have said a decision on Dembele must be taken by Sunday with the transfer window closing at the end of the month.

Dortmund, after a similar transfer story involving last season‚Äôs Bundesliga top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and a possible move earlier this year, are eager to resolve it as quickly as possible.

The team want a second straight league win when they host the Berliners as they look to challenge champions Bayern Munich for the title under new coach Peter Bosz.

Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said any deal should be clinched by Sunday with his club having made their demands clear to the Spaniards and refusing further negotiations.

‚ÄúIf it does not happen by Sunday then the transfer is off the table,‚Äù Watzke said recently. He put chances of the move being completed at ‚Äúunder 50 percent.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey (Barcelona) know very well what we want. They can say if they want him or not. There are only two options,‚Äù he added.

While the exact amount Dortmund are requesting to let the player go is not known, German media have reported a potential transfer could be worth as much as 130 million euros ($153.30 million).

Meanwhile, Bayern will also seek to make it two wins in a row when they travel to Werder Bremen on Saturday.

Last season‚Äôs runners-up RB Leipzig, who slumped to a season opening defeat to Schalke 04 last week, will try to make amends against Freiburg.

Wayne Rooney announces retirement from international football,"Wayne Rooney has announced his retirement from International football. (Source: Reuters) Wayne Rooney has announced his retirement from International football. (Source: Reuters)

Wayne Rooney has drawn curtains on his international career and made the announcement on Wednesday after a glittering 14-year spell as England forward. The 31-year old played 119 games in national colours out of which he captained 22 to score a total of 53 goals.

In a statement on his official website, he said, ‚ÄúIt was great Gareth Southgate called me this week to tell me he wanted me back in the England squad for the upcoming matches. I really appreciated that. However, having already thought long and hard, I told Gareth that I had now decided to retire for good from international football.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a really tough decision and one I have discussed with my family, my manager at Everton and those closest to me. Playing for England has always been special to me. Every time I was selected as a player or captain was a real privilege and I thank everyone who helped me. But I believe now is the time to bow out.‚Äù

He further added that he wants to focus all his energy on helping Everton become successful. ‚ÄúLeaving Manchester United was a tough call but I know I made the right decision in coming home to Everton. Now I want to focus all my energies on helping them be successful,‚Äù he said.

Dreams can come true and playing for @England has been exactly that. Thanks to everyone involved it‚Äôs been amazing ‚Äì http://t.co/GfiT7oVCpx ‚Äî Wayne Rooney (@WayneRooney) 23 August 2017

‚ÄúI will always remain a passionate England fan. One of my very few regrets is not to have been part of a successful England tournament side. Hopefully the exciting players Gareth is bringing through can take that ambition further and I hope everyone will get behind the team.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne day the dream will come true and I look forward to being there as a fan ‚Äì or in any capacity,‚Äù he added.

No guarantee of residence for migrants fleeing US for Canada,"Many said they left fearing deportation due to increased immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump and believing Canada would automatically give them residence, only to experience a rude awakening upon arrival. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) Many said they left fearing deportation due to increased immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump and believing Canada would automatically give them residence, only to experience a rude awakening upon arrival. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)

Men and women with furrowed brows sat in pews alongside their children at a Montreal church as volunteers explained what to expect now that they have crossed into Canada from the United States seeking asylum.

They would receive temporary housing stipends and access to medical care. Their kids could go to school. The volunteers handed out small maple-leaf flags.

‚ÄúI like Canada very much,‚Äù 26-year-old Marline Dorisma of Haiti said later. ‚ÄúThere are lots of opportunities here.‚Äù What they did not get were any assurances that they will be allowed to stay. In fact, many will eventually be told to go back home.

The migrants are part of a recent surge of people crossing over from the United States, including some 4,000 in just the last two weeks, that is straining Canada‚Äôs immigration system to the point where officials turned a domed stadium into a makeshift shelter.

Many said they left fearing deportation due to increased immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump and believing Canada would automatically give them residence, only to experience a rude awakening upon arrival.

It‚Äôs a widely held misbelief that Transport Minister Marc Garneau sought to dispel during a recent visit to the international border near Quebec, where migrants have been crossing over from northern New York.

‚ÄúUnless you are being persecuted or fleeing terror or war, you would not qualify as a refugee,‚Äù Garneau said, ‚Äúand it‚Äôs important to combat that misinformation that is out there.‚Äù

Like in the United States, rules in Canada allow for asylum for people who can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in their homeland based on race, religion, political opinion, nationality or membership in a group like the LBGT community.

Last year Canada granted asylum to 63 per cent of applicants, for a total of nearly 16,000, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

People can also be accepted if Canada fears they face torture or cruel or unusual punishment if they are deported.

But those deemed to be economic migrants are given orders of deportation through a process that can range from several months to many years.

Last year Canada granted asylum to 63 per cent of applicants, for a total of nearly 16,000, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.

For Haitians it was 52 per cent, said Jean-Nicolas Beuze, the representative in Canada for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That was similar to the acceptance rate for Haitians in the United States, about 48 per cent.

Officials, immigration lawyers and other experts say the false belief that Canada will accept all migrants is particularly common among Haitians.

‚ÄúIf these people were aware of the criteria that need to be met in order to be granted refugee status in Canada, and of the likelihood of being turned down and deported from Canada back to Haiti, it‚Äôs possible many of them would probably have decided not to have left the United States,‚Äù lawyer Stephane Handfield said.

Authorities say more than 80 per cent of the 4,000 who crossed into Quebec recently are from Haiti. The rest include people from India, Mexico, Colombia and Turkey, according to the provincial ministry of immigration.

The Trump administration is considering ending a program that granted temporary residency to about 58,000 people from Haiti following the Caribbean nation‚Äôs devastating 2010 earthquake. Canada ended a similar program in 2014.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre being threatened so we have to leave the country, because we‚Äôre illegal,‚Äù said Dorisma. ‚ÄúI was told that Canada isn‚Äôt a country that deports people.‚Äù

At Montreal‚Äôs Olympic Stadium, recent arrivals are sleeping on some 900 cots in a concourse near a rear entrance. Officials say the shelter is operating at 70 to 90 per cent capacity at any given time and will be open until next month.

Migrants said they have been encouraged by the reception they have received so far in Canada, where there have been only minor anti-immigration demonstrations.

Inancieu Merilien, one of hundreds of Haitians at the arena, said he and others were ‚Äúbeing taken care of very well‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing here is like a dream come true.‚Äù

Joseph Jr Clormeus, a pastor of Haitian descent who has been helping migrants, said many still prefer Canada to what they faced south of the border.

In January, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted in response to a US ban on travelers from some Muslim-majority nations: ‚ÄúTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength.‚Äù

But the reality is many will be in an uncomfortable limbo while awaiting a decision on their status. Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council of Refugees, said the lingering threat of deportation will make it difficult to build new lives and get good jobs.

‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt invest in integrating because they don‚Äôt know what the future holds,‚Äù Dench said. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs an extremely stressful situation.‚Äù

Also, despite the access to taxpayer-funded medical care and education, the housing assistance doesn‚Äôt go far. Those subsidies range between about USD 560 per month for a single adult to USD 1,900 for a family of four, meaning multiple migrant families often must squeeze in under the same roof.

Joseph Jr Clormeus, a pastor of Haitian descent who has been helping migrants, said many still prefer Canada to what they faced south of the border.

‚ÄúMost of them are disoriented, weak, and don‚Äôt know what the future will bring,‚Äù Clormeus said. ‚ÄúBut they prefer the uncertainty of life in Canada (over) the certainty of being deported from the United States.‚Äù

Prominent Indian-origin journalist Davan Maharaj ousted as Los Angeles Times editor,"Davan Maharaj. (Source: LA Times) Davan Maharaj. (Source: LA Times)

A prominent journalist of Indian-descent has been fired as the editor of the Los Angeles Times after serving 28 years at the news organisation, as part of a significant shake-up of the American daily‚Äôs top management. Davan Maharaj, who served as both editor and publisher since 2016, was terminated along with other senior editors of the daily. ‚ÄúMaharaj was terminated along with a handful of other senior editors, including Managing Editor Marc Duvoisin, Deputy Managing Editor for Digital Megan Garvey and Assistant Managing Editor of Investigations Matt Doig,‚Äù a report in the LA Times said.

A native of Trinidad, Maharaj began his journey at the paper as a summer intern in 1989 and worked as a reporter in Orange County, Los Angeles and East Africa. He had later served as assistant foreign editor, business editor and managing editor. A six-part series ‚ÄòLiving on Pennies‚Äô done by Maharaj in collaboration with photographer Francine Orr, won the 2005 Ernie Pyle Award for Human Interest Writing and prompted readers to donate tens of thousands of dollars to support aid agencies in Africa. While Maharaj was editor, The Times won three Pulitizer Prizes, including for breaking news reporting of the 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino.

‚ÄúDuring the last 28 years, it has been an honour working with the best journalists in a great American newsroom,‚ÄùMaharaj said in an email, quoted in the LA Times report. ‚ÄúThey are indomitable, and I wish them well in their continued fight to serve our community. I‚Äôm proud of the workwe‚Äôve done,‚Äù he added. Ross Levinsohn, a veteran media executive who worked at Fox and had served as interim chief of Yahoo, was named publisher and chief executive of the 135-year-old LA Times. Jim Kirk, who was publisher and editor of the Chicago Sun-Times until last week, was named interim editor. The move was announced by Justin C Dearborn, chief executive of Tronc, the parent company of The Times and eight other daily newspapers as part the organisation‚Äôs plans toinvest more resources towards ushering it into the digital age.

The report added that the shake-up came just one month after an investigative report was published in The Times that revealed that the former dean of the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine had partied with a prostitute and drug dealers, including on campus. Some reporters who had worked on the project approached senior corporate management to express concern that Maharaj and Duvoisin had delayed the story for fear of upsetting USC,which hosts the newspaper‚Äôs annual Festival of Books. Maharaj and Duvoisin had defended the handling of the story, noting that sensitive and complicated articles take months to report, edit and legally review, the report added.

"Rupee swings back to 2-wk high of 64.04, gains 8 paise vs US Dollar","The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced by 0.09 per cent to stretch gains for the third straight session. (File/Photo) The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced by 0.09 per cent to stretch gains for the third straight session. (File/Photo)

The rupee on Thursday gained 8 paise to close at two-week high of 64.04 against the US currency helped by dollar selling and firm stock markets. Consistent selling of dollars by some foreign banks and unwinding of short-term forward contracts by exporters mainly boosted the sentiment for the local unit, dealers said. The overall forex market sentiment was largely perturbed by the global central bankers‚Äô meet at Jackson Hole which begins on Thursday, they added. Traders are awaiting for US Fed chair Jenet Yellen‚Äôs speech on Friday for hints over the US central bank‚Äôs policy stance.

Meanwhile foreign portfolio investors continued to remain net sellers in equity markets as they sold shares worth Rs 696 crore on net basis on Thursday, provisional exchange data showed.

The benchmark BSE Sensex advanced by 0.09 per cent to stretch gains for the third straight session.

The home currency resumed on strong note at 64.03 from last close of 64.12 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market.

It later hit a fresh intra-day high of 64.02 in late afternoon deals before ending at 64.04, showing a smart rise of 8 paise, or 0.12 per cent. This is the best closing for the rupee since August 9, when it had settled at 63.84.

For the week, the Indian unit has appreciated by 11 paise after two-straight week fall.

Forex market will remain closed tomorrow for Ganesh Chaturthi.

In the meantime, the US dollar remained firm against other major currencies as investors turned their attention to the upcoming Jackson Hole summit. The dollar index, which measures the greenback‚Äôs value against a basket of six major currencies, was up at 93.16.

The RBI, meanwhile, fixed the reference rate for the dollar at 64.0676 and for the euro at 75.5805.

In cross-currency trades, the rupee strengthened further against the pound sterling to close at 82.07 from 82.17 per pound and rebounded against the Euro to settle at 75.54 from 75.66 earlier.

It also bounced back against the Japanese yen to end at 58.53 per 100 yens from 58.72 yesterday.

In forward market today, premium for dollar dropped further owing to sustained receivings from exporters.

The benchmark six-month premium payable in January edged down to 120.50-122.50 paise from 122-124 paise, while far forward July 2018 contract also moved down to 257-259 paise from 258-260 paise.

Picking Up the Threads,"As designer Madhu Jain completed three decades in the fashion industry this year, she chose to mark it with a 22-piece collection celebrating her ‚Äúlifelong journey in Indian textiles‚Äù. The collection, which was showcased in the Capital in March, highlighted her enduring affair with ikat, kalamkari and Central Asian embroideries, although in a modern context.

Jain, who works with natural fibres and has widely experimented with textiles, has now launched a new fabric ‚Äî the bamboo-silk ikat. Calling it eco-friendly and organic, Jain says, ‚ÄúIn the plant kingdom, bamboo stands tall as being among the most eco-friendly. It absorbs 35 per cent more carbon dioxide than other trees, and is biodegradable. And because it doesn‚Äôt need fertilisers or pesticides to grow, the groundwater around bamboo groves is minus chemicals. In India, most of the bamboo is grown organically. I have used a proportion of 50 per cent bamboo yarn with silk for the bamboo-silk ikat.‚Äù

The fabric, which was launched in Delhi last week, took her ‚Äú15 years of R&D to perfect‚Äù. Jain adds, ‚ÄúAs a craft revivalist and textile conservationist, my effort is to keep alive a sector that is otherwise in danger of being extinguished by factory production. This textile took me years of research and on-the-ground work with master weavers. The yarn can be blended with other fibres for durability and strength. It took us 15 long years to produce not just the yarn but the textile.‚Äù

In 1996, Jain worked with an NGO in Bangladesh on the revival of nakshi kantha and is largely credited with the reintroduction of Dhaka muslin in India. She says, ‚ÄúIn the mid-1990s, when I collaborated with BRAC Bangladesh, it cemented my resolve to ensure livelihoods for the artisans.‚Äù In the past, she has blended Andhra ikat with that from Odisha, and has also combined elements from Thailand and Gujarat‚Äôs patola to make a double ikat.

On the potential of the new fabric in India, and other bamboo-growing nations for that matter, Jain says, ‚ÄúSince India is the second largest bamboo-growing country in the world, we are well-positioned to grab ascendancy in bamboo yarn production. Right now, because I have crafted only a limited number of standalone pieces, prices are a little stiff. Until we go into mass production, pricing will continue to be on the higher side.‚Äù

The designer is happy with the increased focus on the revival of crafts in India. She says, ‚ÄúIt is important to appreciate where we come from ‚Äî our roots and traditions are intrinsic to who we are today. After the Industrial Revolution and the dawn of factory production, the Indian crafts industry took a backseat. Artisans gave up their family tradition and migrated in search of jobs. Slowly, we‚Äôre losing our traditional skills. Which is why there is the need for a strong craft revivalist movement in India.‚Äù

Jain has created a full-fledged collection out of the new fabric, perhaps aiming to make it a part of the contemporary fashion statement. The bamboo-silk ikat collection has 40 pieces of Indo-Western wear ‚Äî tunics, shirts, achkans, trousers, balloon pants and pyjamas. She calls it a ‚Äútester‚Äù for future innovation. ‚ÄúThe basic bamboo yarn is luminescent ivory. Much as I would have loved to do an entire collection in that hue, I had to add colour to suit every taste. We have dyed our textile to enhance the ikat design element,‚Äù she adds.

Britain on Tuesday welcomed a commitment by U.S. President Donald Trump to step up the military campaign against Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan.

Builders of RERA-registered projects delay delivery timelines in Maharashtra: Study,"The report stated that the timelines for 57% of the registered units that are under construction have been revised by more than a year.

More than three weeks after the deadline was over to register real estate projects with the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), an analysis by property consultancy Knight Frank India revealed that several residential projects that were to be handed over to buyers this year have witnessed an extension of delivery timelines.

The findings of the report indicate that more than 50 per cent of residential units registered with RERA have extended their time period for completion by over a year, and 30 per cent will have an extended deadline of more than two years.

The report stated that the timelines for 57% of the registered units that are under construction have been revised by more than a year. Among them, for 24 per cent of the 1, 07,875 registered units, the completion deadline has been pushed to between a year and 18 months while 19% will be delayed by between 2-4 years and the remaining 10% would not get completed before four years.

The analysis pointed out that only one-third of the projects listed with MahaRERA are set to be completed on time. Chief Economist and National Director of Research at Knight Frank, Dr Samantak Das attributed the reason to the presence of RERA as a regulator which now commands and controls real estate developers.

‚ÄúBuilders know that now that they have registered, there will be penal action against them if they fail to complete the project within the time period they mentioned while registering. They are thus taking a buffer zone by increasing completion timelines,‚Äù said Das.

Das added that a significant number of residential units still unsold should have been completed as per the initial commitment of delivery. ‚ÄúThere was a lack of seriousness in the completion time commitments made to the buyers before RERA came to effect. The MahaRERA database or similar information networks created by other states would bring the missing information parity between buyers and developers which will play a crucial role in the financial planning of home buyers setting a new paradigm in the real estate sector,‚Äù he said.

The analysis covered projects registered until August 16 in central and western suburbs including Andheri and Borivali Talukas which stretched from Bandra in the south to Dahisar in the north, and the stretch between Kurla, Tilak Nagar and Mulund in the central suburbs. The study found that at least 48% of the registered units are still unsold.

Himachal Pradesh government waives Rs 14 crore in tax owed to it by two gold traders,"When contacted, Chaudhary said, ‚ÄúThe Himachal government had been unfair to the gold processing industry.

I had presented my case to CM Virbhadra Singh and other ministers with full facts.‚Äù (Representative Image) When contacted, Chaudhary said, ‚ÄúThe Himachal government had been unfair to the gold processing industry. No other state had this entry tax. We pay customs duty and other duties to the central government. I had presented my case to CM Virbhadra Singh and other ministers with full facts.‚Äù (Representative Image)

The Himachal Pradesh cabinet has decided to waive Rs 14 crore in tax owed to the state government by two gold businessmen, allegedly despite objections by the departments concerned. State‚Äôs Excise and Taxation Minister Prakash Chaudhary, when asked about the decision, said, ‚ÄúThere is nothing wrong in it. Himachal is the only state which had imposed entry tax on gold, which the businessmen imported for processing, and thereafter on its sale after refining works. No other state has such a tax. Thus, we will not charge/recover it,‚Äù he said.

While one gold processing unit is located at Nadaun in Hamirpur district, the other at Parwanoo in Solan district has already shut. The promoter of Nadaun unit, Prabhat Chaudhary, had unsuccessfully contested two Assembly elections against Sukhwinder Sukhu, the incumbent state Congress president and a rival of CM Virbhadra Singh.

The state government had initially imposed an entry tax of one per cent on gold, which was later reduced to .50 per cent and thereafter to .10 per cent. The two units did not deposit the entry tax since 2013 despite notices. The liability of Nadaun unit was around Rs 5.64 crore while the rest was recoverable from the second unit, which had become defunct.

When contacted, Chaudhary said, ‚ÄúThe Himachal government had been unfair to the gold processing industry. No other state had this entry tax. We pay customs duty and other duties to the central government. I had presented my case to CM Virbhadra Singh and other ministers with full facts.‚Äù

Himachal has a debt burden of Rs 50,000 crore and had to raise Rs 800 crore in loans only last week to meet ways and means situation. Insiders say some of the cabinet ministers were opposed to the waiver while an excise official said the ‚Äúcabinet memorandum had put all in black and white about objections of the various departments and serious illegalities‚Äù.

Singapore rejects US academic Huang Jing‚Äôs appeal against expulsion,"Picture for representational purpose Picture for representational purpose

Singapore has rejected a US citizen‚Äôs appeal to stay in the city-state following the cancellation of his permanent residence status after the government branded him as an agent of foreign influence. Earlier this month, Singapore‚Äôs Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) revoked the permanent residence of Huang Jing, then a professor at Singapore‚Äôs prominent Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, and of his wife, Shirley Yang Xiuping, also a US citizen. Both had appealed the decision.

The minister for home affairs has rejected their appeals and they were informed of the rejection Aug. 23, the MHA said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the decision was final. ‚ÄúHuang Jing and his wife will have to leave Singapore within a stipulated grace period. They will be permanently banned from re-entering Singapore,‚Äù the statement said.

The ministry‚Äôs decision to revoke Huang‚Äôs permanent residency this month was based on his alleged interactions with a foreign country with the aim of bringing about a change in the direction of Singapore‚Äôs foreign policy. It also said Huang‚Äôs wife was aware of his activities. The ministry did not identify the foreign country with which Huang was said to be interacting. Huang did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Indian-origin CEO racially abused by Donald Trump supporters over comments on Charlottesville protest,"Ravin Gandhi bombarded by hate comments on his option piece on Charlottesville violence. (Source: Twitter/Ravin Gandhi) Ravin Gandhi bombarded by hate comments on his option piece on Charlottesville violence. (Source: Twitter/Ravin Gandhi)

An Indian-origin CEO was racially abused and told to ‚Äúgo back to India‚Äù and also take along Nikki Haley after he said that he will not support President Donald Trump‚Äôs economic agenda after the US leader appeared to defend white supremacists following the Virginia violence.

US-born Ravin Gandhi, 44 founder and CEO of GMM Nonstick Coatings, a global supplier of coatings for cookware and bakeware, wrote an op-ed for CNBC following Trump‚Äôs Charlottesville remarks but was quickly trolled and racially abused by readers, the Chicago Tribune reported. ‚ÄúI recently told the New York Times I was ‚Äòrooting‚Äô for certain aspects of Trump‚Äôs economic agenda,‚Äù Gandhi wrote in the op-ed.

‚ÄúAfter Charlottesville and its aftermath, I will not defend Trump even if the Dow hits 50,000, unemployment goes to 1 per cent, and GDP grows by 7 per cent. Some issues transcend economics, and I will not in good conscience support a president who seems to hate Americans who don‚Äôt look like him.‚Äù Hundreds of white supremacists clashed with counter demonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville on August 12 in which a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 injured when a car drove into a crowd of protesters.

Gandhi was soon bombarded by hate comments on his option piece, including a voicemail from a woman who said Gandhi should ‚Äúget your (expletive) garbage and go back to India.‚Äù The woman, using abusive and inappropriate language, told Gandhi that he should also take ‚Äúthat other half-(expletive) Bangladesh (expletive) with you, Nikki Haley,‚Äù referring to the US envoy to the UN.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs (Haley) the one that started all this when she took down the Confederate flag. So don‚Äôt tell us that you gave him a chance. We don‚Äôt give a (expletive) who you gave a chance, OK? We‚Äôre going to start taking down Buddhist statues and see how you and Nikki Haley like that,‚Äù the woman said.

In the minute and a half voicemail she said Gandhi should ‚Äúgo clean up your own (expletive) country, it‚Äôs a filthy mess.‚Äù Gandhi posted the voicemail to YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and shared some of the nastier emails he received as well, the report said.

‚ÄúIt was obvious that people thought my professional position somewhat protected me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI wanted to show people that racism is blind to socioeconomics. It just is.‚Äù ‚ÄúEven though my race is a complete non-issue in my day-to-day life, the sad reality is there‚Äôs a group of racists in the USA that views me as a second-class citizen,‚Äù he said in the report.

‚ÄúI wanted my peers in the business community, the civic community, my friend community to see that this can happen to me. Because there‚Äôs this delusion that racism is dead because Obama was elected.‚Äù Gandhi added that the fact that Trump ‚Äúequated hate groups with those protesting hate lit me up‚Äù as he called Trump‚Äôs moral leadership on the issue ‚Äúreprehensible.‚Äù

He said while his sharing a ‚Äúbigoted‚Äù voicemail may not make a big difference, but he will speak out against such abuse as long as he has a platform to do so. ‚ÄúMy heroes are Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, people who stood up against insane odds. And let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî I live in doorman-protected building in the Gold Coast. For me to say that I‚Äôm suffering in any real sense is insane. But many people in this city who don‚Äôt have resources really are suffering.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm on the right side of history here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I sleep at night.‚Äù

The Windfall

Diksha Basu

Bloomsbury India

304 pages

` 499

The title of Diksha Basu‚Äôs eminently readable new novel, The Windfall, is pretty straight-forward. Anil Kumar and Bindu Jha, Mr and Mrs, are your decent, middle-class, East Delhi Uncle and Aunty, professionals, parents, neighbours, likely to register median on most national surveys. That is, until Mr Jha‚Äôs homegrown website (simplycall.com) is acquired by an American company for twenty million dollars. Said windfall sends them careening out of their comfortable if quotidian Mayur Palli housing society to a glamorous bungalow in a posh, tree-lined avenue of Gurgaon. The consequences of this almost stratospheric shift become the subject of Basu‚Äôs breezy novel-of-manners.

In Mayur Palli, one merely had to compete with the Guptas who drive a Honda Swift, or the Patnaiks who are obsessed with the notion of getting their homely daughter married to Rupak, the Jha offspring, studying towards a business degree in a private college in Ithaca. But, Rupak is failing business school and he also has an American girlfriend to boot. Basu‚Äôs Mayur Palli captures, with exactness, the sights and sounds of East Delhi that are familiar to most Delhiwallas.

In Gurgaon, though, one must keep up with the Chopras. Dinesh Chopra has recreated the Sistine Chapel in their family foyer, at great expense. Although he addresses most whims of his family-members ‚Äî his wife Geeta and ‚Äúpoet‚Äù son Johnny ‚Äî and all fancies of his own, Mr Chopra still can‚Äôt keep at bay the uneasy feeling that ‚Äúrelative‚Äù to his neighbours, he was becoming poorer. As the Jhas move in next-door, with their Japanese sofa studded with Swarovski crystals and brand new Mercedes, Dinesh Chopra and Anil Kumar Jha soon begin to mirror each other‚Äôs acquisitive obsessions, leading to bizarre scenarios.

There are two competent sub-plots. A rather feel-good one involving the changing fortunes of Reema Ray, Mrs Jha‚Äôs best friend and neighbour, a young widow who feels suffocated in Mayur Palli; and, a more nuanced one about Rupak, who is torn between his parents‚Äô changing class-status ‚Äì middle-class or newly rich? ‚Äì and two women, one Indian and one American.

There is, however, no doubt The Windfall has been written primarily for an American readership. What would be trousers in India become ‚Äúslacks‚Äù. Even more problematically, Gurgaon, that steaming city with a monster‚Äôs breath and gilded eyes, where extreme affluence and urban poverty exist cheek by jowl, becomes a ‚Äúmonolith‚Äù in Basu‚Äôs world ‚Äî all quiet, tree-lined, ‚Äúan oasis of calm‚Äù as it were. Something that an American audience would equate with affluent suburbs of New York City, perhaps? In Westchester County or Scarsdale? The real Gurgaon, of course, is no oasis of calm. Neither is it exclusively for the rich. Indeed, it was after Mayur Vihar and its obverse in the south, Vasant Kunj, became well-nigh impossible to afford, that a large chunk of the middle-classes escaped to the high-rise apartments of Gurgaon that they could afford on EMIs, so much so that these too, in due course, became ‚Äúaspirational‚Äù.

It is, of course, heartening to see a novel of this sort, gentle humour, honest story-telling, and a clever Candace Bushnell-like pulse on contemporary trends (albeit without any Candace Bushnellian emphasis on sex) do so well in the US, given it has nothing whatsoever to do with caste, terrorism or atrocities on women, the usual favoured memes. One breathes a sigh of relief as it were to see that immigrants and exotic locations are no longer what sell. However, the attendant points this raises is rather troubling. Had this novel been published only in India, it would have disappeared from the mid-list before you finished saying windfall, perhaps even unreviewed in newspapers or magazines. Must (windfalls in) Indian writing in English come to India via an MFA degree and a global (read American) launch to be read at all? What does that say about the state of the industry in India at large?

Chew on that while you read the book!

A tough balancing act: The new bitter North-South divide in India‚Äôs sugar industry,"A farmer bringing his trolley of cane at a sugar mill in Bijnor, UP. (Source: Express Photo/Oinam Anand) A farmer bringing his trolley of cane at a sugar mill in Bijnor, UP. (Source: Express Photo/Oinam Anand)

India‚Äôs sugar industry seems headed for a North-South divide, with drought conditions leading to huge cane shortages in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, even as Uttar Pradesh (UP) is poised for a second straight year of record production.

Annual sugar consumption in the five southern states ‚Äî Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu (TN), Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Telangana ‚Äî is estimated at around 5.5 million tonnes (mt) out of the country‚Äôs total 25 mt. In normal years, the combined production of Karnataka (3.5-4 mt), TN (1.5-2 mt) and AP & Telangana (one mt) is more than sufficient to meet the region‚Äôs consumption requirements.

But that‚Äôs changed in the current 2016-17 season (October-September), which has seen Karnataka‚Äôs sugar output nearly halve to 2.1 mt, with Tamil Nadu and AP & Telangana also registering sharp declines. For the first time in recent memory, the southern region‚Äôs total output of just over 3.6 mt will fall far short of demand. The situation, moreover, is likely to be the same in the ensuing season as well (see table).

The implications of it aren‚Äôt small, as traditionally only the central (Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan), eastern (West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand) and northeastern regions have been deficit in sugar. Their requirement has, in turn, been met by surplus producers like UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka. But with the South, too, now turning deficit, the usual inter-regional sugar flows are set for disruption.

Mills in Karnataka and TN have already sought permission for duty-free imports of raw sugar under the tariff rate quota (TRQ) system, which, they say, will help improve their capacity utilisation and also bridge the hitherto non-existent demand-supply gap in the region.

Karnataka mills want to import up to one mt of raws at zero duty, which can be processed along with the juice from the cane they would crush in the 2017-18 sugar season. Mills in Tamil Nadu ‚Äî which has experienced an unprecedented drought, resulting in production plunging from 2.38 mt in 2011-12 and 1.93 mt in 2012-13 to slightly above one mt in 2016-17 and a projected 0.6 mt in the forthcoming season ‚Äî are likewise seeking to import 0.6 mt under TRQ. Imports of both raw and refined or white sugar attract 50 per cent duty in the normal course.

Allowing duty-free imports ‚Äî even up to a limit of 1.5-2 mt and to be undertaken solely for processing by southern mills through designated ports such as Chennai, Tuticorin, Karaikal, New Mangalore, Goa and Jaigarh ‚Äî isn‚Äôt going to an easy decision, though. At a macro level, India‚Äôs likely production of 24-25 mt, along with 4 mt of opening stocks on October 1, should just about cover its domestic requirement for the next season and also leave behind enough sugar for a month or two of consumption.

Sugar processed from imported raws will be about Rs 10/kg cheaper than if produced from domestically sourced cane. Sugar processed from imported raws will be about Rs 10/kg cheaper than if produced from domestically sourced cane.

But supply-demand calculations apart, there is also the political dimension. The Centre, only on July 10, increased the import duty on sugar from 40 to 50 per cent. That move ‚Äî together with the more recent hike in edible oil tariffs and quantitative restrictions imposed on imports of arhar, moong and urad pulses ‚Äî is seen to be signaling a subtle shift in the Narendra Modi government‚Äôs policy focus, from being largely ‚Äòpro-consumer‚Äô to ‚Äòpro-farmer‚Äô.

In the case of sugar, the main beneficiaries of the apparent policy shift have been UP‚Äôs mills. While Maharashtra‚Äôs industry is yet to fully recover from that state‚Äôs back-to-back droughts in 2014 and 2015, UP has emerged as the country‚Äôs No. 1 producer. That development has been no less due to the widespread adoption of Co-0238, an early-maturing cane variety giving both higher yields to farmers and extra sugar recovery to mills (http://bit.ly/2jBpBk6).

Raw sugar is currently trading in New York at 13.5 cents a pound or 14.05 cents ($ 310 per tonne), after factoring in a 4.05 per cent ‚Äòpolarisation premium‚Äô for extra sucrose content. Adding ocean freight of $30 from Brazil takes the landed cost in India to $340 or almost Rs 22,000 per tonne. Inclusive of expenses towards port handling, bagging and transport to factory (Rs 1,500-2,000) and refining-cum-processing losses (Rs 4,000), the total cost of the resultant white sugar works out to Rs 27,500-28,000 per tonne. That, of course, is subject to the imported raws not being charged to any duty. On the other hand, ex-factory sugar prices are now ruling at Rs 36,000-37,000 per tonne in UP and Maharashtra, while at Rs 3,700-3,800 in Karnataka and Rs 3,800-3,900 in Tamil Nadu.

Simply put, sugar processed from imported raws will be about Rs 10/kg cheaper than if produced from domestically sourced cane. It is only the 50 per cent duty that‚Äôs preventing imports from taking place. And in a scenario where the Modi government is under pressure to be seen as pro-farmer ‚Äî more so in UP, where the Bharatiya Janata Party is in power ‚Äî it may not be inclined to allow duty-free imports even under TRQ.

The above pro-farmer policy tilt in sugar could, however, still face challenges on two counts. The first is the upcoming festival season demand ‚Äî Dussehra is on September 30, followed by Diwali on October 19 ‚Äî that could push up retail prices, which have already crossed Rs 45 per kg in many parts. The second is the fact that more than 40 per cent of domestic sugar production today is coming from a single state ‚Äî UP ‚Äî even as the southern region has turned from being sugar-surplus to sugar-deficit. It opens up the possibility for not just a producer-consumer, but also a new North-South divide.

The Indian cricketers present at the team‚Äôs optional training session here were asked try out new training kits. Those at ground on Tuesday were MS Dhoni, Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Kedar Jadhav, Manish Pandey and Kuldeep Yadav. After sweating out at the nets, the players were asked for their feedback about the new gear by the representatives of the India‚Äôs official apparel sponsor Nike.

‚ÄúThe players will use the new set here and also during the limited-overs home series against Australia in September-October. Based on their feedback, the Nike will decide on its official launch,‚Äù the source said.

The gear-switch is noteworthy since it comes in the wake of players, and subsequently the BCCI, complaining about the quality of their playing and training clothing in the series so far.

Reportedly, the players‚Äô concerns were taken seriously in the last CoA meeting. BCCI CEO Rahul Johri told The Indian Express: ‚ÄúIt (Nike‚Äôs clothing) has come up for discussion in last CoA meeting and chairman CoA (Vinod Rai) took it very strongly. The team cannot have sub-standard kits and we will be engaging with Nike and he has asked to put our case strongly.

"Commuter train crashes into parked train, injuring dozens","In this frame from video, a person is pulled away from the scene of a train crash in Upper Darby, Philadelphia. (Source: AP) In this frame from video, a person is pulled away from the scene of a train crash in Upper Darby, Philadelphia. (Source: AP)

A one-car commuter train crashed into a parked train at a suburban Philadelphia terminal early Tuesday, buckling the floors of both cars and injuring more than 30 passengers, authorities said.

None of the injuries was considered life-threatening, said Heather Redfern, a spokeswoman for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.‚ÄúSome were considered walking wounded,‚Äù she said.

The train operator, who was treated at a hospital and released midday, submitted samples for drug and alcohol tests, said Ruben Payan, lead investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. He said the NTSB also had asked to interview the operator Wednesday, along with the operator of a train on adjacent tracks and transit supervisors.

The Norristown High Speed train crashed into the unoccupied train car at the 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby around 12:15 a.m., tossing passengers from their seats.‚ÄúI heard the train going real fast ‚Ä¶ like, super-fast,‚Äù passenger Raymond Woodard told WPVI-TV Woodard. ‚ÄúAnd I looked up, and I saw that we‚Äôre at 69th Street and said, `Why are we going so fast?‚Äô And then we just hit the train. Boom! I fell out of my chair, glass from the window shattered, I hit my head. Everybody was on the floor.‚Äù

Neither train car derailed, and Payan said damage overall did not appear to be major. But he said investigators wouldn‚Äôt know for sure until the two cars could be inspected in a shop.

He said it could take up to a year to produce a final report on the cause and safety recommendations.‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt ruled anything out right now,‚Äù Payan said, adding that video recovered from both cars will be reviewed.

The transit agency had put the number of injured at 42. But the NTSB said the total number of injured was 33 _ 32 passengers and the train operator. In February, four people were injured in a crash near the 69th Street Terminal involving three out-of-service commuter trains. At the time, SEPTA said one train rear-ended another on a loop where trains turn around to get back into service. Cars from that accident derailed and hit a third train on nearby tracks.

In his new book, Neel Mukherjee keeps an unwavering focus on the inequities, inequalities and exploitation of human beings by human beings

Title: A State of Freedom

Author: Neel Mukherjee

Publisher: Penguin Random House

Pages: 278

Price: Rs 599

If Neel Mukherjee‚Äôs Booker-shortlisted The Lives of Others (2014) was a diachronic dissection of the Ghosh family, spanning lifetimes, in his latest offering, A State of Freedom, he uses his linguistic scalpel for a synchronic cutting open of India‚Äôs now and here. Less a novel than a set of five linked narratives, their lengths ranging from a brief eight pages to a novella-length 100, A State of Freedom is probably the most sustained reflection on class in post-Liberalisation India in contemporary fiction. Reminiscent of two monumental works of non-fiction, P Sainath‚Äôs path-breaking Everybody Loves a Good Drought, published over two decades ago, and Sudeep Chakravarti‚Äôs Red Sun: Travels in Naxalite Country, published in 2008, Mukherjee‚Äôs novel brings back to the discussion table issues that seem to have fallen out of favour with the chatterati and the intelligentsia these last few years.

From the opening narrative‚Äôs unnamed protagonist, the Kolkata-born and‚Äìbred ‚Äútourist in his own country‚Äù, whose two decades in ‚Äúthe academic communities of the East Coast of the USA [have] defanged him of the easy Indian ability to bark at people considered as servants‚Äù, to the second narrative‚Äôs first-person narrator, a London-based designer, also Kolkata-born, who too is appalled at the way in which supposedly educated people like his own parents treat domestic workers in India, to the ‚Äúservants‚Äù themselves, who are the subjects of the three remaining narratives, Mukherjee keeps an unwavering focus on the inequities, inequalities and exploitation of human being by human being in every story.

Yet, as the protagonists of his stories seem to believe, and Mukherjee himself seems to at times, not all human beings are equal, or, more problematically, capable of being equal. In the second narrative, the first-person narrator parenthetically describes his own use of the term ‚Äúdomestic help‚Äù thus: ‚Äú(My mother‚Äôs generation still called them servants. My politically correct tag [i.e. domestic help] had not a jot of correlation to their status: their position in the Indian social hierarchy or economy had never changed)‚Äù. But this ironic self-deprecatory statement is marred by the statement, a few lines earlier, of the creation of the state of Jharkhand ‚Äúcarved out‚Ä¶ after decades of agitation and activism by tribal peoples and backward castes ‚Äî they had that dreaded Indian distinction, the branding iron of an acronym: OBC, Other Backward Castes ‚Äî for a separate state‚Ä¶‚Äù etc. One notes several things here. First, the bleeding-heart-liberal championing of the underdog (tribals and backward castes); second, the use of the adjective ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù (see all the quotes above ‚Äî Indian ability, Indian social hierarchy, dreaded Indian distinction); and, finally, the egregious error about the expanded form of ‚ÄúOBC‚Äù, which stands for ‚ÄúOther Backward Classes‚Äù and not ‚ÄúOther Backward Castes‚Äù. Is this the narrator‚Äôs error or Mukherjee‚Äôs? And is the repeated use of the adjective ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù to indicate primitive, casteist, sexist, class-biased positions a reflection of the narrators‚Äô views or Mukherjee‚Äôs own? Not an easy question to answer.

A central takeaway from this beautifully written novel is that if one is born in middle-class, relatively privileged, urban India (a member of the English-medium class) one can only imbibe democratic and human values, and develop the ability to look critically at oneself, if one lives in the West; remaining in India dooms one to continue one‚Äôs horrifically solipsistic middle-class existence, treating everyone who is one‚Äôs social inferior with contempt and brutality. Such, for example, are the people who are Milly‚Äôs employers ‚Äî the domestic help/servant who moves from the underdeveloped Naxal-infested jungles of Jharkhand to the highrises of Bombay/Mumbai (where she works for the parents of the second story‚Äôs narrator, among others) ‚Äî one of whom, in Kolkata, is described as having picked up and thrown a 10-year-old boy ‚Äúdown the hole through which the lift goes up and down‚Äù. Milly, central figure in the novella-length narrative, is told she ‚Äúshould be grateful for what you have ‚Äî things are far worse out there‚Äù by the tribal Christian woman who had got her a job as a domestic worker.

Mukherjee‚Äôs novel strikes all the right guilt-ridden-anti-capitalist-liberal-pinko-lefty chords so beloved of the West‚Äôs educated classes: middle-class Indians (who are actually pretty near the top of the class hierarchy, and so, should be seen as rich) are brutal exploiters of innocent tribals; innocent tribals who convert to Christianity end up exploiting their own people; development has only added modern forms of misery and enslavement to India‚Äôs traditional heritage of discrimination and violence; the only way out of this seems to be death, whether willed or otherwise. No wonder it has won high praise from Western critics. But for this reviewer, the biases that Mukherjee seeks to lay bare with his cutting prose end up revealing some of his own ‚Äî and these are not always very pretty.

A magnificently written, marvellously phrased book, with its heart in its right place, A State of Freedom might not be quite what its Western critics claim (‚Äúdevastating portrait of the inhumanity of the rich to the poor‚Äù, and so on) but it is certainly worth the read, if only to discover what it stumbles in attempting as also what it succeeds in achieving.

BBC journalist on trial for Thailand crime reporting,"Jonathan Head, the BBC‚Äôs Southeast Asia correspondent, faces up to five years in jail at the private prosecution on the popular tourist island of Phuket. (Representational Image) Jonathan Head, the BBC‚Äôs Southeast Asia correspondent, faces up to five years in jail at the private prosecution on the popular tourist island of Phuket. (Representational Image)

A British BBC journalist appeared in a Thai court on Wednesday for the start of a criminal defamation trial brought by a lawyer who featured in an investigation about foreigners being scammed of their retirement homes. Jonathan Head, the BBC‚Äôs Southeast Asia correspondent, faces up to five years in jail at the private prosecution on the popular tourist island of Phuket.

Rights groups have said the case exposes how Thailand‚Äôs broad defamation and computer crime laws scupper investigative journalism and make it difficult to uncover wrongdoing in an endemically corrupt country.

The prosecution was sparked by a 2015 report by Head detailing how two foreign retirees had Phuket properties stolen from them by a network of criminals and corrupt officials. One of the victims, British national Ian Rance, is a joint defendant in the prosecution. Both have pleaded not guilty.

The man bringing the prosecution is Pratuan Thanarak, a local lawyer who featured in the BBC‚Äôs report looking at how Rance lost USD 1.2 million worth of properties.

According to the report, Pratuan admitted on tape to certifying Rance‚Äôs signature without him being present, a move which helped the British retiree‚Äôs then wife transfer his properties out of his name.

She was later convicted and jailed for the scam.

A copy of Pratuan‚Äôs complaint seen by AFP alleges that the BBC‚Äôs report caused him to be ‚Äúdefamed, insulted or hated‚Äù. It does not detail whether he notarised the signature without Rance being present.

Pratuan declined to speak about the case on the way into court. He warned gathered photographers that he would file a lawsuit against anyone who published images of him.

Neither Head nor Rance spoke to reporters on their way into the Phuket court today.

In a previous statement the BBC has said it ‚Äústands by its journalism‚Äù and that they ‚Äúintend to clear the name of our correspondent‚Äù.

Rance and Head face one charge of criminal defamation, which carries up to two years in jail.

Head faces an additional charge under Thailand‚Äôs Computer Crimes Act, a broadly-worded law which forbids uploading ‚Äúfalse data‚Äù online and carries a five-year maximum jail penalty. Unlike most countries where defamation is a civil crime, in Thailand it is a criminal offence. Private citizens can also launch their own prosecutions and they are not forced to pay costs if they lose.

Similar cases have been brought in recent years. Local news site Phuketwan closed down in 2015 after running out of money in its successful bid to defeat a suit brought by Thailand‚Äôs navy. Andrew Drummond, a British crime reporter, left the country the same year because of multiple cases brought by those he exposed as did British labour rights activist Andy Hall in 2016.

"Malin village: Affected wall wasn‚Äôt part of original plan, says College of Engineering team","THE PUNE district collector‚Äôs office has issued a one-month ultimatum to contractors to complete repair work of all the damaged walls and structures in Malin village, located around 100 kms from the city.

On June 25, night-long rain, measuring 97mm, had exposed the quality of the newly-constructed walls, which were built as part of a rehabilitation project in April this year.

An expert team from the College of Engineering (CoEP) had visited the site and assured that all the new homes were in good shape and structurally sound.

However, during its two visits since June, the team found that the structures that had developed cracks were constructed without its knowledge.

Sharing their findings with The Indian Express, senior faculty at CoEP and team leader BG Birajdar said, ‚ÄúUpon inspecting the site, it was learned that the cracks have developed on walls, which were not present in the original plan. The contractors might have used substandard quality material and not followed the desired design norm, which is why it developed cracks following the first heavy rainfall.‚Äù

Officials added that the last-minute decision of announcing the completion of rehabilitation works could also have resulted in the contractors leaving some key tasks unfinished.

Birajdar said, ‚ÄúWorks of drainage lines and other sources of water were not satisfactory. Being rainy season, it was easy for water to stay accumulated at the base of the new structures , which could have later gave-in to pressure in the form of cracks and fissures.‚Äù

As a corrective measure, the engineering team has now asked the contractor to reconstruct the wall, as per standards.

‚ÄúThis (new) wall will have deeper and stronger foundation. Construction of the new wall has begun and is expected to be completed within a month,‚Äù he added.

A senior geologist who studied the area after the incident pointed out that the soil, which was used as landfill, too, was very loose in nature and had a typical characteristic of withholding greater amounts of water.

‚ÄúThis highly moist soil would not have settled sufficiently, which allowed easy seepage of running water, thus caving-in the roads,‚Äù he said.

The collector‚Äôs office has asked the contractors to speed-up the repair works, failing which their payments will not be disbursed.

After the completion, CoEP team will visit the site for final inspection before certifying it fit for use.

* Trump defends Virginia response in raucous, rambling speech

* Police use pepper spray on protesters outside Phoenix arena

* Defiant Trump mocks U.S. news media: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre bad people‚Äù

* Former intelligence director question‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs fitness for office

* Trump promises government shutdown to build Mexico border wall

U.S. President Donald Trump revved up supporters on Tuesday with a defense of his response to a white supremacist-organized rally in Virginia and a promise to shut down the U.S. government if necessary to build a wall along the border with Mexico.

Under fire for saying ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù were to blame for the violence between white supremacists and left-wing counter protesters in Virginia on Aug. 12, Trump accused television networks of ignoring his calls for unity in the aftermath.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say I love you because you‚Äôre black, or I love you because you‚Äôre white,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI love all the people of our country.‚Äù

Police used pepper spray to disperse crowds after protesters threw rocks and bottles outside the convention center where Trump spoke, police said.

Trump, who often uses news organizations as a foil, repeatedly singled out the media for criticism of how it covered the violence in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville and the resulting political fallout.

‚ÄúThese are truly dishonest people. They‚Äôre bad people. I really think they don‚Äôt like our country,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúThe only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media.‚Äù

Adopting a glib tone, Trump said many reporters ignored his condemnation of white supremacists, including the Ku Klux Klan.

‚ÄúI hit ‚Äôem with neo-Nazi, I hit ‚Äôem with everything ‚Ä¶ KKK? We have KKK. I got ‚Äôem all,‚Äù he said.

James Clapper, a former director of U.S. national intelligence, expressed concern at Trump‚Äôs performance, calling it ‚Äúdownright scary and disturbing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI question his fitness to be in office,‚Äù Clapper told CNN.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

Funding for the border wall has flagged in the U.S. Congress as many lawmakers question whether Trump‚Äôs main promise during the 2016 presidential election campaign is really necessary.

But with a budget battle looming, Trump said he would be willing to risk a politically damaging government shutdown in order to secure funding for the wall. He visited the border region in Yuma, Arizona, earlier on Tuesday.

‚ÄúIf we have to close down our government, we‚Äôre building that wall,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have our wall. The American people voted for immigration control. We‚Äôre going to get that wall.‚Äù

With thousands of supporters cheering him on, Trump also weighed in on another racially charged issue, hinting he would pardon former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

Arpaio, 85, who battled illegal immigration in the Phoenix area, was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case.

NAFTA, NORTH KOREA

Trump covered the gamut of issues, from NAFTA trade talks to the U.S. showdown with North Korea, during a raucous, rambling and defiant political speech lasting an hour and 15 minutes.

He said he might terminate the NAFTA treaty with Mexico and Canada to jumpstart negotiations, and said the standoff with North Korea over its weapons programs might have taken a positive turn.

However, it was unclear whether the speech would help lay the foundation for a comeback from the deep political crisis Trump finds himself in after only seven months in office and an approval rating below 40 percent.

He expressed frustration that the Republican-controlled Congress was unable to approve healthcare legislation that failed to pass the Senate by one vote last month. One of the votes against the legislation was cast by Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was recently diagnosed with brain cancer.

Without mentioning their names, Trump criticized both McCain and his fellow Arizona Republican, Senator Jeff Flake.

Neither McCain nor Flake attended the event.

Trump complained repeatedly about the ‚Äúone vote‚Äù that stopped the Senate from repealing and replacing Obamacare, the signature domestic policy of his predecessor, Barack Obama.

‚ÄúOne vote away. I will not mention any names ‚Äì very presidential. And nobody wants me to mention your other senator, who‚Äôs weak on border, weak on crime. Nobody knows who the hell he is! See, I haven‚Äôt mentioned any names, so now everybody‚Äôs happy,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSHERIFF JOE‚Äù

The White House had said earlier when asked about Arpaio that ‚Äúthere will be no discussion of that today.‚Äù That did not stop Trump from raising the subject.

‚ÄúDo the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?‚Äù Trump asked, sparking loud applause and a chant of ‚ÄúPardon Joe!‚Äù ‚ÄúWas Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?‚Äù Trump asked, before predicting that Arpaio would be just fine. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do it tonight because I don‚Äôt want to cause any controversy. But Sheriff Joe can feel good,‚Äù he said.

Trump drew broad criticism for blaming both white nationalists and counter-protesters for the deadly violence at the Charlottesville rally, which was organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. One woman was killed.

He mocked left-wing protesters in his speech.

Protesters outside Tuesday‚Äôs rally yelled: ‚ÄúShame, shame, shame‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA‚Äù as the Trump supporters began filing into the Phoenix Convention Center.

Supporters, who lined up for hours in the Arizona heat ahead of the event, chanted: ‚ÄúBuild the wall.‚Äù Many wore red hats with Trump‚Äôs campaign slogan, ‚ÄúMake America Great Again.‚Äù

Trump has held a series of 2020 re-election campaign stops despite only having taken office in January.

Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, had asked him to postpone Tuesday‚Äôs event while the nation healed from outrage and division after the deadly rally in Charlottesville.

A heavy police presence was deployed around the Phoenix venue for Trump‚Äôs first trip as president to Arizona, which he won in the 2016 election.

Ram Vilas Paswan On Forming A Mahagatbandhan With The Congress,
Author Akhil Sharma talks about short stories and compelling characters,"The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo) The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. (Source: File Photo)

The greatest challenge for a short story writer, says one of the foremost names in the field ‚Äî who might not be too well known in India but has built up an impressive resume in the US ‚Äî is to stick to its ideal length, with the writer captivating his readers in a way that they have no desire for more.

‚ÄúKnowing that a story is only 15 or 20 pages means that you are restricted in how many characters you can have or situations you can entertain. This means that the entry into the story has to be so strong that the reader has no desire for more,‚Äù Akhil Sharma told IANS in an email interview from New York.

The writer stressed upon the fact that the ideal length of a short-story is somewhere between 15 to 20 pages. He maintained that once a writer goes beyond this length, the stories begin to take the shape of novellas. But temptation is always lurking around the corner.

‚ÄúThe problem is that characters can be so compelling that one feels the need to follow them,‚Äù he quipped.

Delhi-born Sharma, who emigrated to the United States in 1979, is certainly not among the most well-known faces of our literary fraternity but the illustrious career of this prolific author is still a distant dream for many writers.

His stories have been published in the New Yorker and Atlantic Monthly, and included in ‚ÄúThe Best American Short Stories‚Äù and ‚ÄúO. Henry Prize Collections‚Äù. Sharma‚Äôs first book, ‚ÄúAn Obedient Father‚Äù, won the PEN/Hemingway Award in 2001. His second novel, ‚ÄúFamily Life‚Äù won the Folio Prize in 2015 and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2016. ‚ÄúI began writing ‚ÄòWe Didn‚Äôt Like Him‚Äô the day after I handed in my novel ‚ÄòFamily Life‚Äô. I began it with the idea that I just wanted a story with a beginning, middle and end. I had the opening line and I had an idea for someone who wants to be a televangelist.

‚ÄúI then just began describing the character and trying to make him sympathetic. Part of this meant inventing his back story and what would be natural for him as his life progressed. I wrote one ending and it didn‚Äôt satisfy me and so I wrote another,‚Äù the author said on being asked to throw light on the journey of a short story ‚Äî from the time of its inception to its fulfilment.

‚ÄúWe Didn‚Äôt Like Him‚Äù, along with seven others, comprise his latest book. Titled ‚ÄúA Life of Adventure and Delight‚Äù (Penguin/Rs 599/190 Pages), the book is a collection of stories that focus on Indians at home and abroad and plunge the reader into what Sharma calls the unpredictable workings of the human heart.

Sharma said that he loves short stories. ‚ÄúThey are demanding and fun and there is the sense that unlike a novel, one is not held hostage by them,‚Äù he elaborated. The author further shared that his short stories have become looser with time. ‚ÄúThey cover longer periods. I find that the transition between my paragraphs is not as tight. More and more I think short stories are simply narratives where an event occurs and a character changes or does not change even though we would expect him to,‚Äù he contended.

Sharma hoped that short stories are published in newspapers like they used to be in the past, adding that they have a specific place in the world and will always remain relevant.

"Kim Jong Un orders production of more rocket engines, warhead tips","Kim was briefed about the process of manufacturing intercontinental ballistic missile warhead tips and solid-fuel rocket engines. (Source: AP Photo) Kim was briefed about the process of manufacturing intercontinental ballistic missile warhead tips and solid-fuel rocket engines. (Source: AP Photo)

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the production of more solid-fuel rocket engines and rocket warhead tips, the North‚Äôs official media said on Wednesday in a report otherwise lacking threats against Washington after weeks of heightened tension. A report about Kim‚Äôs visit to a chemical institute came not long after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to make a peace overture to Pyongyang, welcoming what he called the recent restraint shown by the reclusive North.

Kim was briefed about the process of manufacturing intercontinental ballistic missile warhead tips and solid-fuel rocket engine during his tour of the Chemical Material Institute of the Academy of Defence Science, the North‚Äôs official KCNA news agency said. ‚ÄúHe instructed the institute to produce more solid-fuel rocket engines and rocket warhead tips by further expanding engine production process and the production capacity of rocket warhead tips and engine jets by carbon/carbon compound material,‚Äù KCNA said.

North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and dozens of missile tests since the start of last year, significantly raising tensions on the heavily militarised Korean peninsula. Two tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles in July resulted in a new round of tougher global sanctions.

The last missile test on July 28 put the U.S. mainland in range, prompting heated exchanges that raised fears of a new conflict on the peninsula.

Tillerson, however, noted what he called the restraint the North had shown lately and said on Tuesday he hoped a path could be opening for dialogue some time in the near future.

South Korea and the United States are conducting an annual joint drill involving computer simulations of a possible war on the Korean peninsula, exercises that the North routinely describes as preparation for invasion. The drills started on Monday and will run through to Aug. 31. South Korea will also conduct a voluntary civil defence drill across the country later on Wednesday. The KCNA report said Kim had given ‚Äúspecial thanks and special bonus‚Äù to officials of the institute, calling them heroes. A photograph showed Kim in a grey pinstriped suit, smiling before a large flow chart that described some kind of manufacturing process.

However, there was none of the fiery rhetoric of recent weeks, when Kim threatened to fire missiles into the sea near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam after U.S. President Donald Trump earlier warned North Korea it would face ‚Äúfire and fury‚Äù if it threatened the United States. New U.S. sanctions announced on Tuesday target Chinese and Russian firms, as well as individuals, for supporting Pyongyang‚Äôs weapons nuclear and missile programmes.

Here are all the places that let you drive with you Indian driving licence,"Pick your favorite destination and cruise your way through. (Source: File Photo) Pick your favorite destination and cruise your way through. (Source: File Photo)

Travelling by road is a great way to explore a country and experience it the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù way. If you love driving and are wondering if you will ever be able to cruise down the autobahn, there are a few countries you can drive in with your Indian driving licence.

Experts from global travel search engine Skyscanner has come up with a list of countries where you can use your Indian driving licence.

* Germany: Driving on Germany‚Äôs Romantic Road, an approximately 400-km-long route through the heart of Bavaria is one of the best ways of exploring the country. The German Castle Road is another classic route along which you can find more than 70 castles, and postcard-like views. Indians can drive in Germany with their Indian driving licence for up to six months provided you carry a German translation. You can get this from any German diplomatic mission. However, having an international driving permit, while not mandatory, can be handy as it carries translations.

* Switzerland: You don‚Äôt want to miss trains ‚ÄúDilwale Dulhaniya‚Ä¶‚Äù style, and instead want to drive in this gorgeous country? Good decision, because there are so many lovely driving routes in Switzerland. One of the most famous passes in the Alps is the St. Bernard Pass. The Swiss section of the road begins in Martigny and ends in San Bernadino, 56 km away. You can take this route if you‚Äôre driving from Zurich to some of the Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland. Indians can drive in Switzerland for up to one year with a valid Indian driving licence.

* France: Whether you want to take in the beauty of the French Alps and drive hundreds of kms watching the dramatic changes in the scenery, or just take a nice short drive from Santenay to Dijon and enjoy the wine country, France doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Take your time stopping in between and sample some of the finest vintage wines the country has to offer. Indian visitors can drive in France for a year with a valid Indian licence as long as they carry a French translation with them.

* Norway: The Land of the Midnight Sun beckons you to come and explore its amazing fjords. Drive from Oslo to Bergen and you‚Äôll pass some of the most beautiful villages, waterfalls, and fjords in Europe. Indian visitors can drive in Norway for three months with a valid Indian driving licence.

* US: This is a land where people love to drive, and when in Rome do as the Romans, right? Some of the best road trips in the US include the drive from Torrey to Bryce Canyon National Park (Highway 12, Utah) and the drive on the Pacific Coast Highway through California. This doesn‚Äôt even begin to scrape the surface, because the country has so many lovely driving routes. So plan your trip to the US well in advance to get cheap flight tickets. Then forget about any agenda, just get off the plane, rent a car and drive.

Indian visitors can drive in the US for a year with their Indian driving licence as long as it is in English. If it isn‚Äôt, then an international driving permit is required with the translation. You also need to have an I-94 form, which shows the date on which you arrived in the US.

* Australia: When you‚Äôre driving in Australia, there‚Äôs no dearth of pleasant surprises. You can drive in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory with an Indian driving licence. However, in the Northern Territory, you can drive only for three months. Also keep in mind that you can only drive those types of vehicles that your international driving licence allows you to drive.

"Statins may help combat typhoid, malaria","It would be highly beneficial for patients to develop a better immune system with lesser drugs. (Source: File Photo) It would be highly beneficial for patients to develop a better immune system with lesser drugs. (Source: File Photo)

Besides lowering cholesterol levels, drugs such as statins or Ezetimibe may one day prove to be effective in providing protection against infectious diseases, including typhoid fever, chlamydia and malaria, researchers have found.

The findings give insight into the mechanisms that govern human susceptibility to infectious disease and point to possible avenues to protect against pathogens ‚Äî like Salmonella or Ebola ‚Äî that hijack cholesterol to infect host cells. ‚ÄúThis is just the first step,‚Äù said Dennis C. Ko, Assistant Professor at the Duke University in the US.

‚ÄúOur study provides a blueprint for combining different techniques for understanding why some people are more susceptible to disease than others, and what can be done about it,‚Äù Ko added.

The study, appearing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that some people may be more susceptible to the highly contagious disease through a gene variant ‚Äî VAC14 ‚Äî which affects cholesterol levels. This mutation was found to raise cholesterol levels which binds Salmonella Typhi, the culprit behind the potentially deadly infection, to a person‚Äôs cells, thus increasing the risk of typhoid fever.

According to World Health Organisation estimates, nearly 21 million cases and 222,000 typhoid-related deaths occur annually worldwide.

‚ÄúDiscovering the mechanism was important because plenty of people are on cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially statins, for high cholesterol,‚Äù Ko said. ‚ÄúWe wondered if similar drugs could be given to reduce the risk of Salmonella infection,‚Äù Ko noted.

Furthermore, other common cholesterol-lowering drug like Ezetimibe were found to protect zebrafish against Salmonella Typhi. The researchers emphasised the need to try the approach in different model organisms, such as mice, and likely with different pathogens, before considering taking this into the clinic.

A Gentleman: Things you should know about the Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez starrer,"A Gentleman, starring Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez, is all set to hit screens on August 25. While the hotness quotient of the film, thanks to the chemistry of Sidharth and Jacqueline, has already made all of us excited for the release, there are few things you should keep in mind before heading to the theaters. Did you know A Gentleman was supposed to be titled Reloaded? In an interview with indianexpress.com, Sidharth had revealed that film was a pop-corn tale which was back then tentatively titled Reloaded.

The film was rumoured to be the sequel of 2014 hit Bang Bang. And for a long time, the actors and the makers had to battle the speculation. But all the rumours came to rest when the trailer released as it revealed that Sidharth would be seen in a double role for the first time ever. Yes, the actor is playing 'susheel' Gaurav and risky 'Rishi' in the film.

Jacqueline Fernandez looks the hottest in this film. It seems like the actor has toned herself even more to look apt for the pole dance she has performed for the first time on screen. Well, she adds the oomph factor to the film, and we are loving how she slays on the pole and on the floor.

Sidharth is not lagging behind by the way. The actor is flaunting his body too. The guy-next-door has moved the hotness quotient a notch higher with his chiseled bod and perfect abs. We just cannot get over his beach look in the song Baat Ban Jaye from the film.

China warns US ahead of Taiwan defence minister‚Äôs brief visit,"Taiwan Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan attends a parliamentary session at Legislative Yuan in Taipei. (Source: Reuters) Taiwan Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan attends a parliamentary session at Legislative Yuan in Taipei. (Source: Reuters)

China warned the United States on Tuesday against any military contacts with Taiwan ahead of brief visits by the self-ruled island‚Äôs defence minister to the United States on his way to and from Central American allies. The United States is Taiwan‚Äôs main source of weapons and Taiwan has been pressing for sales of more advanced equipment to deal with the rapidly modernising military of China, which claims Taiwan as its own.

Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan would make brief transit stops in New York and Los Angeles on his Aug 23-Sept. 8 trip, and had nothing else on his agenda in the United States, the ministry said.

Feng would visit Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic to ‚Äúfurther deepen bilateral friendly relations‚Äù, the ministry said in a statement.

Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had noted the reports. ‚ÄúChina consistently insists on using the ‚Äòone China‚Äô principle in handling the issue of the Taiwan region‚Äôs exchanges, and firmly opposes country‚Äôs with which China has established relations conducting any type of official contact or military exchanges with Taiwan,‚Äù Hua told reporters.

‚ÄúOur position is clear and consistent. I believe the United States is extremely clear on this.‚Äù

Taiwan presidents and other senior officials frequently stop over in the United States while visiting Taiwan‚Äôs dwindling number of allies in Latin America and the Caribbean, always drawing China‚Äôs ire.

China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and has stepped up military drills around the island in recent months. Proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China.

Taiwan now only has official diplomatic ties with 20 countries. Panama dropped its diplomatic ties with Taiwan to instead recognise China in June. China says Taiwan is merely a province with no right to diplomatic ties with other countries.

The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, acknowledging that China takes the position that there is ‚Äúone China‚Äù and Taiwan is part of it. But the United States is also duty-bound by legislation to help the island defend itself.

(Source: Google Maps)

Two people, including a policeman, were killed in a suicide bombing in the northeast Nigerian city of Maiduguri, the epicentre of Boko Haram‚Äôs insurgency, police and witnesses said.

Eleven others were injured in the attack at Muna Garage on the outskirts of the city, which has been repeatedly targeted by the Islamists, police said in a statement.

A male suicide bomber detonated explosives ‚Äústrapped to his body‚Äù near a police armoured vehicle on patrol in the area at around 1:45 pm (local time), the police said. A civilian was killed while seven others and four SARS (special anti-robbery squad) personnel were injured.

Witnesses and a rescue worker said a policeman was also killed in the blast that badly damaged the armoured vehicle. ‚ÄúThe driver of the police vehicle was killed along with a civilian,‚Äù said witness Idrissa Suleiman. His account was supported by a rescue worker involved in the evacuation of the victims, who said the policeman‚Äôs body and that of the two bombers had been removed.

Suleiman said a suspect among the crowd that gathered at the scene then attempted to snatch a policeman‚Äôs weapon but was gunned down. However police then ‚Äúwent wild‚Äù and fired into the air to scare away potential attackers, with stray bullets hitting three people, one of whom died from head injuries.

Boko Haram has recently stepped up suicide and gun attacks on ‚Äúsoft targets‚Äù, including schools, mosques, markets and motor parks in Maiduguri area. The eight-year jihadist uprising to establish a hardline Islamic state in Nigeria‚Äôs mainly-Muslim north has killed at least 20,000 people and displaced 2.6 million, sparking a dire humanitarian crisis in the region. The violence has also spilt into neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon.

Agnieszka Radwanska gets past Eugenie Bouchard at Connecticut Open,"Agnieszka Radwanska advanced to the quarters in Connecticut ‚Äì a week before US Open. (Source: AP) Agnieszka Radwanska advanced to the quarters in Connecticut ‚Äì a week before US Open. (Source: AP)

Top-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska survived a second-set comeback bid from Eugenie Bouchard to advance to the quarterfinals of the Connecticut Open on Tuesday.

The 10th-ranked Radwanska, who won the title in New Haven last year, defeated Bouchard 6-3, 7-5 in 1 hour, 45 minutes. The Polish veteran is 4-0 in her career against the Canadian, who needed a wild card to enter the tournament.

Bouchard fought off two match points but was broken while serving to force a tiebreak.

‚ÄúI expected this kind of match,‚Äù Radwanska said. ‚ÄúI think she seems better now than a few months ago, playing more consistent.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling much better than in the beginning of the year. I‚Äôm not struggling with my health anymore so I feel strong. I feel better and more confident on court as well so that is helping.‚Äù

Also advancing were Australia‚Äôs Daria Gavrilova, who needed 2 hours, 12 minutes to defeat Timea Babos of Hungary 7-5, 7-6 (6), and Elise Mertens of Belgium, a straight-sets winner over Russia‚Äôs Daria Kasatkina. No. 8 seed Peng Shuai of China eliminated Mirjana Lucic-Baroni of Croatia with a 6-2, 6-3 victory, and Spain‚Äôs Carla Suarez Navarro moved into the second round when Slovakia‚Äôs Jana Cepelova retired in the second set of their match.

The Connecticut Open is the final women‚Äôs tuneup for the U.S. Open, which begins on Monday.

L-G order cancelling bungalow allotment to AAP set aside by Delhi HC,"Anil Baijal (File) Anil Baijal (File)

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday set aside Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal‚Äôs order cancelling the allotment of a bungalow to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), stating that it did not refer to any rules and policies. Justice Vibhu Bakhru directed the L-G to pass a ‚Äúreasoned order‚Äù within eight weeks after providing an opportunity to the AAP to be heard. ‚ÄúNo showcause notice was issued‚Ä¶ it is ex-facie apparent that the L-G order is not reasoned and it is not possible to discern under which policies it was passed,‚Äù the judge said.

The judge also told the Centre that if there was a policy for allotment of bungalows to political parties, it had to be uniform. Referring to the Public Works Department‚Äôs orders directing the AAP to pay dues of about Rs 27 lakh as rent, the judge said ‚Äúconsequent orders‚Äù passed after the passing of the L-G‚Äôs directive were to be put in ‚Äúabeyance‚Äù.

In April, the L-G had cancelled the allotment of bungalow 206 in Rouse Avenue after the Shunglu Committee report raised questions about the allotment. The Shunglu panel was set up to probe alleged irregularities in the functioning of the Delhi government. The AAP then moved the High Court, saying that according to the Centre‚Äôs policy, all registered political parties were entitled to a bungalow. But the AAP was singled out and the bungalow allotment was cancelled, it said.

Tabu denies playing Sushma Swaraj in Uzma Ahmed‚Äôs biopic,"Tabu has not been approached to play Sushma Swaraj in Uzma Ahmed biopic. Tabu has not been approached to play Sushma Swaraj in Uzma Ahmed biopic.

Several reports on Thursday suggested Golmaal Again actor Tabu will play External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in filmmaker Dhiraj Kumar‚Äôs biopic on Uzma Ahmad, the woman who was rescued by Sushma from Pakistan. But now it has been revealed that Tabu was never approached for the movie. In fact, she was not even aware of such a movie being made.

Annoyed by the reports, the National Award-winning actor, in a statement, slammed the reports and the cheap antics of production houses to create buzz around their movie. She said, ‚ÄúI have no idea why filmmakers who have not approached me give out false news of my being approached for their movies when I have not even been contacted or made aware of a certain project. This has also happened in the past. In fact, in some cases, some really big and established production houses have taken the liberty of using my name for a project without as much as my consent.‚Äù

Tabu further revealed that the filmmakers sometimes use such practices to put pressure on other actors who may be approached for the role. ‚ÄúI think this is clearly done to hype their projects and to create insecurity amongst other actresses who may be approached for the role. This is a poor practice and people should stop using my name in vain. Honestly, it shows them(filmmakers) in poor light when I issue a denial like this. Unfortunately, they leave me with no choice because no one has bothered to even check with me,‚Äù said Tabu who will be next seen in Rohit Shetty directorial Golmaal Again which also stars Ajay Devgn. Both Tabu and Ajay have earlier worked in suspense-thriller Drishyam.

With these rumours put to rest by Tabu, we wonder if the news about Parineeti Chopra and Taapsee Pannu being a part of the biopic are true or not.

Blunt instrument? What a list of banned articles says about China‚Äôs censors,"ar from being well-oiled machine, though, China‚Äôs censorship regime is fragmented and often undermined by gaps, workarounds, and perhaps even hasty officials, say academics specialising in Chinese politics. (File) ar from being well-oiled machine, though, China‚Äôs censorship regime is fragmented and often undermined by gaps, workarounds, and perhaps even hasty officials, say academics specialising in Chinese politics. (File)

An old review of an academic monograph on agrarian revolutionaries in 1930s China is hardly a political third rail in Beijing on Wednesday, even by the increasingly sensitive standards of the ruling Communist Party. That such a piece appeared on a list of some 300 scholarly works that Cambridge University Press (CUP) said last week the Chinese government had asked it to block from its website offers clues about the inner workings of China‚Äôs vast and secretive censorship apparatus, say experts.

President Xi Jinping has stepped up censorship and tightened controls on the internet and various aspects of civil society, as well as reasserting Communist Party authority over academia and other institutions, since coming to power in 2012. Far from being well-oiled machine, though, China‚Äôs censorship regime is fragmented and often undermined by gaps, workarounds, and perhaps even hasty officials, say academics specialising in Chinese politics. ‚ÄúCrude is the word,‚Äù said Jonathan Sullivan, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham in Britain. ‚ÄúThe blunt way in which articles were chosen for censoring ‚Ä¶ suggest to me that there was not a lot of thought put into it.‚Äù

CUP, the publishing arm of Britain‚Äôs elite Cambridge University, on Monday reversed its decision to comply with the request to censor the articles published in the journal China Quarterly following outcry over academic freedom. China‚Äôs response remains to be seen. The education ministry, foreign ministry, cyberspace administration and state publishing authority all declined to comment.

The list of articles the authorities wanted blocked covered topics that are considered sensitive by the government, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests, the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Tibet, Taiwan and the violence-prone far-western region of Xinjiang. But it was far from thorough or comprehensive. The article on 1930s agrarian revolutionaries may have got there by mistake, say experts.

What appears to have condemned the scathing but otherwise innocuous 1991 review of Kamal Sheel‚Äôs book about a Communist base area in China‚Äôs southern heartland was the fact the place was named Xinjiang, and the word appeared in the book title.

The Chinese characters are different for Xinjiang, the village, and Xinjiang, the mostly-Muslim region more than 2,500 km (1,550 miles) to the northwest that is beset by ethnic tensions and occasional unrest. But in English they are indistinguishable.

KEYWORD SEARCHES

Xu Xibai, a doctoral candidate at the University of Oxford, tweeted a brief analysis of the list that noted that its creators appear to have hastily searched the China Quarterly database for taboo words in titles and abstracts. ‚ÄúThe censors probably used a few keyword searches to locate just enough articles to make a nice, long list to impress their superiors,‚Äù Xu‚Äôs post said. ‚ÄúThey did not bother to read the articles or go through the content list manually.‚Äù

An article defending Mao Zedong was on the censored list, for instance, while others more critical of the former paramount leader were not. Some sensitive subjects seem to have eluded the officials‚Äô net. The Communist Party tightly controls discourse on the 1958-61 Great Leap Forward, in which millions starved to death due to ill-conceived economic policies. Censors have banned books on the topic but it was apparently not on this list.

Nor were the brutal, Communist-led land reforms of the 1950s, or the Hundred Flowers Movement, an effort by Mao to lure critics out of the woodwork by feigning openness, only to punish them. The party‚Äôs efforts to censor news and information have sometimes backfired or left outsiders perplexed.

In 2009, software designed to check pornographic and violent images on PCs blocked images of a movie poster for cartoon cat Garfield, dishes of flesh-colour cooked pork and on one search engine a close-up of film star Johnny Depp‚Äôs face. Citizen Lab, a group of researchers based at the University of Toronto, compiled a list of words banned as of last year on popular live streaming sites in China. Among them: ‚ÄúMoulin Rouge‚Äù, ‚Äúbraised rabbit‚Äù, ‚Äúhelicopter‚Äù and ‚Äúzen‚Äù.

The request to block the articles was passed to Cambridge University Press by its import agent, but without knowing where it originated it is hard to draw firm conclusions, said Sebastian Veg, a China scholar at the School of Advanced Studies in Social Sciences in Paris. ‚ÄúThe censorship system is of course centrally directed, but not uniform,‚Äù Veg said.

Lee Siu-yau, assistant professor of Greater China studies at the Education University of Hong Kong, suspects the request was a trial balloon. ‚ÄúThey usually start with something small-scale and gradually expand and make their requirements more difficult,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThis might be one of the first steps that the Chinese government would take to see if it could actually influence international academic publishers.‚Äù

Champions League Play-offs: In-demand Lorenzo Insigne nets as Napoli advance,"Napoli‚Äôs Lorenzo Insigne scored in the 89th minute to make it 2-0 for the Italian team. (Source: Reuters) Napoli‚Äôs Lorenzo Insigne scored in the 89th minute to make it 2-0 for the Italian team. (Source: Reuters)

Lorenzo Insigne netted his 50th goal for Napoli on Tuesday as the in-demand forward helped his team book a place in the Champions League group stage by beating Nice. Napoli was already leading through Jose Callejon‚Äôs goal when Insigne struck from the edge of the penalty area in the 89th minute to complete a 2-0 win on the French Riviera and send his team through 4-0 on aggregate.

Whether Insigne is still at Napoli next month is unclear, with Barcelona among the leading clubs reported to be interested in signing him before the summer transfer window closes on Aug. 31.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to hear that top clubs are watching me, but doing well with the Napoli shirt is something I have always dreamt of,‚Äù Insigne said on the UEFA website. ‚ÄúI think we improved a lot, especially in terms of mentality, hopefully we can also win trophies.‚Äù

The 26-year-old Insigne is off the mark quickly this season after taking three months to find the net last year.

‚ÄúLorenzo is an absolute talent,‚Äù Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri said. ‚ÄúAt the moment he‚Äôs the player who best represents Italian football.‚Äù

There was a very different verdict on Nice‚Äôs Italian striker, Mario Balotelli, who was described as ‚Äúhighly inadequate‚Äù by coach Lucien Favre.

Balotelli had been off the pitch arguing with the fourth official, leaving Nice with 10 men early in the second half, when the unmarked Callejon tapped in at the far post to put Napoli in front. Balotelli, who has a checkered disciplinary record, was booed by his own Nice fans when he was later substituted.

SCORING RECORD

Celtic held a 5-0 lead over Astana but the Scottish champions were given a scare in Kazakhstan, where they lost 4-3 but still advanced 8-4 on aggregate. The 12 goals over the two games set a scoring record for the Champions League playoff round.

Kristoffer Ajer‚Äôs own goal in the 26th minute gave Astana a glimmer of hope of mounting a comeback. Although Scott Sinclair leveled eight minutes later, quick-fire Astana goals at the start of second half from Serikzhan Muzhikov and Patrick Twumasi restored the host‚Äôs lead on the night.

Twumasi netted again in the 69th to send Astana into a 4-1 lead but his team still required three more goals to go through. Celtic‚Äôs nerves were eased by goals in the 80th from Olivier Ntcham and Leigh Griffiths in the 90th.

MARIBOR AT THE TREBLE

Only one side in action on Tuesday was eliminated after winning the first leg. Hapoel Be‚Äôer Sheva‚Äôs 2-1 advantage over Maribor was wiped out by the Slovenian side winning the second leg 1-0 at home.

Maribor went through 2-2 on away goals to contest the group stage for a third time after previously qualifying in 1999 and 2014.

FAVOURITES ADVANCE

Sevilla is through to the group stage for a third successive season after drawing 2-2 with competition newcomer Istanbul Basaksehir to advance 4-3 on aggregate. Sergio Escudero and Wissam Ben Yedder scored for Sevilla.

Rijeka‚Äôs first Champions League campaign in 18 years is over after Olympiakos built on its 2-1 first leg success by winning 1-0 in Croatia. The Greek side will contest the group stage for the 18th time.

The lineup for Thursday‚Äôs group-stage draw will be completed on Wednesday. Teams losing in the playoff round drop into the group stage of the Europa League in September.

UN slams US govt‚Äôs ‚Äòfailure‚Äô to reject racist violence,"It also asked the US to provide necessary guarantees so that such rights are not misused to promote racist hate speech and racist crimes. It also asked the US to provide necessary guarantees so that such rights are not misused to promote racist hate speech and racist crimes.

A UN panel has strongly criticised the US government for its ‚Äúfailure at the highest political level‚Äù to unequivocally reject racist violent events in Charlottesville and throughout the country. On August 12, a car rammed into a crowd marching against a white supremacist rally in Virginia‚Äôs Charlottesville, killing a woman and injuring 19 others.

There were clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against the occupation of a park housing a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee. Following the clashes, a state of emergency was declared, and police and security forces were deployed in riot gears.

Without naming President Donald Trump, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) said its members were ‚Äúdisturbed by the failure at the highest political level of the United States of America to unequivocally reject and condemn the racist violent events‚Äù in Charlottesville and suggested that this lack of action fuelled a ‚Äúproliferation of racist discourse and incidents‚Äù.

The committee called on the US government, high-level politicians and public officials to unequivocally and unconditionally reject and condemn racist hate speech and crimes in Charlottesville and throughout the country. In a decision issued under its ‚Äòearly warning and urgent action‚Äô procedure, the Committee, which monitors implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, said that ‚Äúthere should be no place in the world for racist white supremacist ideas or any similar ideologies that reject the core human rights principles of human dignity and equality‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe are alarmed by the racist demonstrations with overtly racist slogans, chants and salutes by white nationalists, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, promoting white supremacy and inciting racial discrimination and hatred,‚Äù said CERD Chairperson Anastasia Crickley.

In addition to the criminal investigation of the individual who ploughed his car into a crowd of peaceful protesters and killed a woman, Heather Heyer, the UN experts asked the US authorities to undertake concrete measures ‚Äúto address the root causes of the proliferation of such racist manifestations‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe call on the US government to investigate thoroughly the phenomenon of racial discrimination targeting in particular people of African descent, ethnic or ethno- religious minorities and migrants,‚Äù Crickley said. The CERD also called on the US to ensure that the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly are not exercised with the aim of destroying or denying the rights and freedoms of others.

It also asked the US to provide necessary guarantees so that such rights are not misused to promote racist hate speech and racist crimes.

Border Dispatch,"Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan.

Meena Menon was The Hindu‚Äôs correspondent in Islamabad for only nine months (August, 2013 to May, 2014) before she was kicked out. It is astonishing to learn from this memoir of how, in such a short time, her empathetic interest in anything and everything Pakistani enabled her to rise well above routine reporting (and routine harassment) to range across virtually the entire gamut of life as it is actually lived in that ‚Äúdistant neighbour‚Äù of ours.

Confined to Islamabad, indeed caged in the city, she let no bureaucratic constriction hinder her personal Discovery of Pakistan. With a keen eye, a sharp ear, an open mind and a large heart, she kept in good cheer whatever the hurdles, made numerous friends, met everyone from top politicians to the proverbial taxi driver, wandered the by-lanes, shopped in different markets, explored the eating places, and did the sights, going to mosques and temples and churches around the capital.

Of course, she filed her regular reports, dutifully attended foreign office briefings, and informed her readers of political events and the proceedings in the National Assembly (Parliament). But she also immersed herself into Pakistan‚Äôs rich cultural life, interacted with artistes, painters, writers, social workers, political activists, fellow-journalists, and, of course, the aam admi. Instead of only obsessing over the India-Pakistan relationship, as many Indian reporters and most Indian diplomats do, it was Pakistan as a nation and a society, and Pakistanis as a people, who interested her. And, amusingly, she never allowed her minders, the two security guys who relentlessly trailed her (and whom she nick-named ‚ÄúBeard‚Äù and ‚ÄúChubby‚Äù) to faze her or derail her from her purpose.

This is what makes this book so special: it takes in all the political and economic see-saw in Pakistan itself, and in our relationship with Pakistan, but rising above both the pride and the prejudice that often overwhelm our perceptions of that country, she unhesitatingly presents both the warts and the astonishing resilience of a people fighting fierce odds.

‚ÄúI could walk around,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúand meet nice people‚Äù. ‚ÄúI had many friends and they were always helpful and kind‚Äù. She talks of ‚Äúa senior politician who treated me like his daughter‚Äù. ‚ÄúMany parliamentarians were friendly,‚Äù she remarks, ‚Äúeven if they made anti-Indian statements.‚Äù A startling revelation is that ‚Äúone place we felt quite welcome was the foreign office‚Äù! Elsewhere, she remarks, ‚Äúthis unconditional affection and warmth is overwhelming‚Äù. ‚ÄúPakistani writers and journalists were always accessible‚Äù and ‚Äúhelped me understand their country‚Äù. She names a whole sheaf of them. She recounts her encounters with the wife of a Pakistani army general, Indu Mitha, who teaches ‚ÄúBharatanatyam to enthusiastic Pakistanis‚Äù and Shenaz Minallah who, despite an attempt to burn down her headquarters, continues to run the Pakistan branch of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar‚Äôs ‚ÄúArt of Living‚Äù: ‚ÄúWe do courses in mostly three cities and from twenty-odd people the number has swelled to over eighty per session‚Äù. There is a moving account of her friendship with the great Sufi singer, Abida Parveen, who says of her hopes for India and Pakistan: ‚ÄúLove is a force, it‚Äôs like the sea, it cannot break‚Äù. She interviews the Baloch Gandhi, Mama Qadeer, the proximate cause of her expulsion. And she admires Shoaib Sultan Khan, a development activist, ‚ÄúThe Man from Pakistan‚Äù, who has done outstanding rural development work in Andhra Pradesh. She records, without further comment, Shoaib‚Äôs assessment of Rahul Gandhi who was much taken with his work: ‚Äúthis young man has his heart in the right place to do something for the poor‚Äù.

She contrasts ‚Äúmost of the media portrayal reinforcing the image of a backward and failed state‚Äù with ‚Äúvisitors (who) are pleasantly surprised when they see glimpses of a country that is different from what they think it is.‚Äù While surveying the many vicious disabilities to which the minorities are subjected (the Ahmedias are the worst treated, ‚Äúthe community lives on the razor‚Äôs edge‚Äù) she also finds space for ‚ÄúPandit Chamanlal from Rawalpindi‚Äù asserting, somewhat startlingly, that ‚Äúthe Hindu community was not targeted in any way‚Äù.

Yet, she is no starry-eyed romantic. She sees the downside clearly: the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù and its connections to terrorism; the persecution of Baloch dissidents and the atrocities inflicted on them; the blatant misuse of blasphemy laws; the sickening treatment of people with different sexual orientations; the awful collateral damage caused by drones; the soaring crime rate. There are graphic descriptions of suicide bomb blasts in the heart of Islamabad to which she was personal witness; and grim stories of mindless cruelty, murder and mayhem.

Her undiluted admiration is reserved for Pakistani journalists. ‚ÄúJournalists can be shot, kidnapped, threatened and abused‚Ä¶life hung on a thread‚Äù. Yet, ‚Äújournalism in Pakistan has been bold and brave‚Äù. She concludes, ‚ÄúThe government and the security empire have the upper hand. Yet, with all the powers at their command, they have not crushed the free spirit of the people who write and report at will‚Äù.

Meena Menon was unceremoniously thrown out of Pakistan in under a year. She harbours no bitterness. Balanced as ever, she remarks, of herself and the treatment meted out to Pak journalists in India: ‚Äúthere is no low both countries cannot stoop to.‚Äù Her final message is: ‚Äúthere is a call for peace and reason, however faint it may be, and it is coming from an invisible majority which is yet to come into its own‚Äù.

Chennaiyin FC sign Spaniard Jaime Gavilan Martinez,"Chennaiyin FC has signed Spanish attacking midfielder Jaime Gavilan Martinez for the upcoming season of the Indian Super League.

The 32-year-old has joined the 2015 ISL champions on a free transfer after the expiry of his contract at South Korean club Suwon FC.

Gavilan played in the second season of the ISL for Atletico de Kolkata. He made 15 starts for the Kolkata franchise, bagging three assists and helped them reach the semifinals, where they lost to eventual champions Chennaiyin FC 4-2 on aggregate.

After leaving ISL, Gavilan has been playing for South Korea‚Äôs Suwon FC.

Gavilan said he was delighted to return to India and the ISL.

‚ÄúI would like to thank Chennaiyin FC for giving me a chance to come back to India. I enjoyed my time here both on and off the field but this time I want to win the title. I look forward to giving my very best for Chennaiyin FC,‚Äù Gavilan said.

Chennaiyin FC head coach John Gregory added: ‚ÄúGavilan has exceptional technical quality with a fantastic CV. He also has the past experience of having played in the ISL two years ago when he had a very good season. He will add great value to our team going forward.

A product of the Valencia youth academy, Gavilan represented Spain at various age group levels. He was part of Spain‚Äôs U-16 and U-19 Euro success in 2001 and 2004 and was

also a member of the 2003 Under-20 World Cup squad that lost to Brazil in the final.

Gavilan spent four seasons in the senior team of his boyhood club Valencia but most of his time there was spent on loan to Getafe and Tenerife. However, he appeared for Valencia

in both the UEFA Champions League and Europa League.

In 2008, Gavilan sealed a permanent move to Getafe and spent six seasons there. In 2014, he moved to Levante but soon joined Greek outfit Platanias.

Bernard Tomic to return for US Open: Reports,"Bernard Tomic is likely to play at the US Open after lengthy absence from court. Bernard Tomic is likely to play at the US Open after lengthy absence from court.

Australia‚Äôs Bernard Tomic is speculated to return to tennis at the US Open having ended his absence from the tour after a controversy ridden period following his first round exit at Wimbledon. His absence from the tour has seen his ranking drop to 146.

Tomic, once considered a potential top-10 player has not played since Wimbledon where he lost to Mischa Zverev and claimed he was ‚Äúbored‚Äù in the post match interaction. His comments weren‚Äôt taken kindly and was subsequently slammed by former players and fined $15,000.

Later while speaking to an Australian TV channel in an interview, he created further furore by saying he was in the sport only for the money and consider this a ‚Äújob‚Äù. The Aussie added he had won plenty of money even without trying hard.

‚ÄúHe is playing the U.S. Open,‚Äù Tomic‚Äôs manager Matthew Fawcett told Melbourne‚Äôs Herald Sun. ‚ÄúFollowing that he is planning to play Chengdu, Tokyo, Shanghai, Antwerp or Stockholm or Moscow, Vienna and Paris.‚Äù

Tomic has withdrawn from his last four tournaments which has seriously affected his ranking to push it down which would need him to battle it out on lower-tier tours or seek wildcards from tournament organisers next year.

His top 30 ranking at the end of 2016 guarantees him slots at ATP 500 tournaments in Tokyo and Vienna but he will need to climb up the charts if he is to qualify for the ATP 1000 Masters series events in Shanghai and Paris in October.

Tennis Australia‚Äôs high performance chief Wally Masur said last month he was worried the long-time Davis Cup player was ‚Äúburnt out.‚Äù

Living in Miami, Tomic‚Äôs party lifestyle has frequently done the rounds of Australian newspapers and former Aussie great Todd Woodbridge feels the reality check is not too far away. ‚ÄúBernard is getting to that point where reality is really going to hit him,‚Äù Woodbridge told The Australian last week. ‚ÄúHe will find out pretty quickly whether he enjoys playing, whether he wants to play and whether tennis can give him a lifestyle he enjoys. Otherwise, it won‚Äôt be long before he discovers that what he has been doing is a wonderful opportunity that has gone begging.‚Äù

The US Open begins on August 28 with many pundits suggesting Tomic does not have the physical fitness required to compete in a five setter.

Lee Chong Wei makes quick exit from World Badminton Championships,"Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia tries to retrieve the shuttle during his first-round match against France‚Äôs Brice Leverdez. (Source: Reuters) Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia tries to retrieve the shuttle during his first-round match against France‚Äôs Brice Leverdez. (Source: Reuters)

There is one iconic shot of badminton legend Lee Chong Wei that stops the heart a wee bit more than the full-throttle jump smash where he is four feet up in air. It‚Äôs the one where he scurries chasing the shuttle with his back to the net. The run abruptly ends with a flat backhand flick mid-stride over the net ‚Äî almost bat blind to where it might land, as he turns on his heel in a jiffy and stands ready for the next shot. It worked beautifully on Tuesday for a fleeting few seconds ‚Äî and gave a stadium the sand-in-hand hope that the Malaysian legend could turn back time.

It didn‚Äôt end in tears because Chong Wei has perfected the tight-lipped, dignified, smiling acceptance after losing 7 out of 7 finals (3 Olympics and 4 World Championships). But short of a meltdown, it all ended in the most heartbreaking fashion as Frenchman Brice Leverdez won 21-19, 22-24, 21-17 in 75 minutes bringing the stadium to a mooring silence as a lifetime of the legend‚Äôs struggles to win the big titles flashed before the eyes. The 35-year-old Chong Wei‚Äôs challenge ended in a pool of errors unable to deal with Leverdez‚Äôs short attack, as the 31-year-old stayed dogged through a second-game comeback from the legend, flattering to deceive once more in his career.

In the press conference that followed his shock exit in Round 1, Chong Wei mulled aloud with a painful pursed-lipped politeness when asked if this was the end. ‚ÄúNow you ask me, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know my plan. Maybe I‚Äôll retire tomorrow,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to go back and see if I still have the fire in me. But tomorrow I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said, looking miserably lost.

‚ÄúHow did the pressure affect you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt affected me, right? I lost in the first round!‚Äù he said with a tight smile.

The story of the eternal ‚Äòbest man‚Äô of badminton is the sport‚Äôs most profound tale over the last decade and a half. But should this be his last match, it will tell in a nutshell the story of how it never worked out for someone who is almost-perfect, and put in shade by the brilliance of Lin Dan.

Chong Wei would struggle from the start, the first few points split equally between him and Leverdez. Still, a first-game loss could‚Äôve been dismissed as a rusty start as it‚Äôs been in several tournaments in recent years before he‚Äôs picked up. However, the torrid errors continued into the second, as the Frenchman stuck to a plan of attacking both flanks and Chong Wei looked awfully out of touch. 14-18 down, he would level at 20, and be saved by a mistimed albeit borderline shuttle as a lucky referral pushed the match into a decider. He would lead by 5 points in the third, but again feel a rash of silly errors, while Leverdez rode his luck on the net and for once, Chong Wei seemed resigned to give up.

The Frenchman‚Äôs single-point warning to himself had been to never lift the shuttle ‚Äî to deny Chong Wei the opening.

‚ÄúI never give up, I keep trying again, but today I did my best but it didn‚Äôt work out,‚Äù Chong Wei would say later, murmuring about how he‚Äôd won the All England this year and beaten Leverdez there, so it wasn‚Äôt a demon in his head. The All England ‚Äî in what‚Äôs been a story of his life ‚Äî despite its tradition, is a Super Series event only, and the biggies have eluded him in scorching public glare. He had his coach of many years Misbun Sidek by his side, but it didn‚Äôt help on this day. ‚ÄúWhen people keep saying ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt win, you don‚Äôt win‚Äô, it‚Äôs so difficult to accept this and carry on. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so special in Malaysia, he‚Äôs something meaningful for our country,‚Äù the coach would say later.

Chong Wei is Malaysia‚Äôs biggest star ‚Äî the heartbeat of a country which unfortunately boasts only one other No 1 ‚Äî Nicole David, the woman squash player, whose sport isn‚Äôt on the Olympics programme. ‚ÄúWe give him whatever he wants in support, because he‚Äôs the greatest. He‚Äôs maintained discipline, so the country will always support him. We‚Äôre not communist, so we won‚Äôt push him out. He‚Äôll be supported for as long as he wants,‚Äù said teammate Yogendra Krishnan.

Considerable support

Malaysian fans had travelled all over from the UK, and left having lost their voices but not their pride in the man. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre disappointed because he‚Äôs the only one. But we keep supporting him no matter what,‚Äù said 28-year-old Wei Chun Lee, who works in London and had travelled overnight. ‚ÄúNot a wink of sleep whole night, and now we‚Äôve lost our will to do anything,‚Äù he would say.

The French and Malaysian fans had built up quite a din, and the whole stadium stopped in its stride, when the drama of the second game unfolded ‚Äì Chong Wei two match points down, eking out an escape one last time at these Worlds where he was seeded 2nd. ‚ÄúWe keep telling ourselves the pressure is so much on him, that it‚Äôs tough to win,‚Äù Lee Gran Hui, 24, said, having cried after the Rio finals where despite beating Lin Dan in the semi-finals, Chong Wei had come up short against the steady Chen Long.

‚ÄúOur second favourite player is Lin Dan. Though he‚Äôs beaten Chong Wei so many times (27 in 39 meetings), they played some of the best matches in the sport and are both legends,‚Äù she added, not regretting once having to put herself through the grief of ending as the second-best always. ‚ÄúNot just us. Our parents‚Äô generation too. He means the world to Malaysians old and young.‚Äù

Misbun, the lanky, upright coach has been besides Chong Wei for most of his life, and counts the Malaysian Open win against Danish Peter Gade in 2004 as his ward‚Äôs best. ‚ÄúIt really impressed me because I knew after that win that this person will fly Malaysia‚Äôs flag high.‚Äù

Misbun would talk about how though he initially came from a modest family where securing himself financially was the first target, his ward did not stop at just that. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to find a talent like Chong Wei, because he had the extraordinary desire to be the best. Obedient, skillful and strong, our success was my brain and his energy,‚Äù he would explain, adding that ‚Äúthe 2008 Beijing final would remain his closest brush at the Olympics.‚Äù

Misbun though conceded that Chong Wei did bring on pressure onto himself. ‚ÄúSometimes when you take badminton too seriously, you can‚Äôt play well. He‚Äôs good when he‚Äôs joyful, but not when he‚Äôs under pressure. But now sometimes I see him enjoying, sometimes not.‚Äù

When asked the pressure-poser, Chong Wei would say, ‚ÄúYea, pressure is normal.‚Äù The legend had internalised expectations to the extent it ran in his bloodstream. It‚Äôs what the Malaysians will eternally be grateful to him for. Lee Chong Wei is worth straining the vocal chords for.

With the current atmosphere in Anfield no club would want to face us in Champions League: Jurgen Klopp,"Jurgen Klopp has claimed that Liverpool is the team that nobody would want to face in the Champions League. (Source: Jurgen Klopp has claimed that Liverpool is the team that nobody would want to face in the Champions League. (Source:

Liverpool Manager Jurgen Klopp has claimed that Liverpool is the team that nobody would want to face in the Champions League group stage. After winning the tie against Hoffenheim by a margin of 4-2, a confident Klopp also stated that with Liverpool‚Äôs participation in the Champions League, it will help the club to bring quality players to Anfield.

‚ÄúWe should be there in the Champions League and we are really excited about who we get. There will be a few nice and difficult opponents but no-one, with this atmosphere, wants to get us in the group stage,‚Äù said Klopp and added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really looking forward to the draw.‚Äù

Expressing satisfaction over the progress in the group stage, Klopp said, ‚ÄúIt is 14 months of the hardest work and it feels amazing. The Champions League is a big influence on the transfer market, especially if you do it more often.‚Äù

Speaking on the impact on the transfer market, he also said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big influence on the transfer market, especially if we do it more often. If you talk to a player, they really often (mention it)‚Ä¶ especially, players, we talk to. We don‚Äôt have to talk to players which are not better than our players because it‚Äôs difficult to find.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know a few people think differently, but we do a lot of work‚Ä¶ if you talk to them, they say if you would play in the Champions League, it would be really interesting because the club is great, the manager is not too bad‚Ä¶‚Äù Klopp concluded.

"Sadio Mane, not Philippe Coutinho, emerges as Liverpool‚Äôs main man","Sadio Mane took four weeks off to attend the African Cup of Nations last season. (Source: Reuters) Sadio Mane took four weeks off to attend the African Cup of Nations last season. (Source: Reuters)

As Barcelona seek to prise Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho away from Liverpool ahead of the transfer deadline, fans of the Merseyside club may be relieved that at least the Spanish club are not bidding for Sadio Mane.

Another electric performance by the Senegal winger against Hoffenheim on Wednesday drew more rave reviews for a player who has become even more indispensable to Liverpool than the Brazilian. Social media was full of jokes about whether Barcelona realise they are trying to buy the wrong player.

‚ÄúIf Coutinho‚Äôs 100 and odd million, then Mane‚Äôs 200 and odd million,‚Äù said former England striker Ian Wright in a Twitter post that captured the mood on Merseyside.

Hoffenheim never came to terms with Mane‚Äôs ability to break defensive lines at pace or his frightening ingenuity when in sight of goal. His two back heels played their part in both Emre Can‚Äôs goals as Liverpool, without Coutinho, romped to a 4-2 win.

‚Äú(Mane‚Äôs) a special player,‚Äù said former favourite Steven Gerrard on BT Sport. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs becoming a fan favourite here, he scores all kinds of different goals. Lots of pace and he‚Äôs a threat all over the pitch.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very direct and when he gets in he‚Äôs got pure quality.‚Äù

The statistics bear out the astonishing impact Mane has had on Liverpool since joining them last summer in a 34 million pound ($44 million) move from Southampton.

Since then, Liverpool have won 18 and lost only three of the 28 times he has played for them in the Premier League, scoring as a team well over two goals per game. In the 12 games without him, Liverpool won just five and lost three, netting a third fewer goals.

When Mane took four weeks off to attend the African Cup of Nations last season, Liverpool‚Äôs title challenge disintegrated, and it is a measure of how well they did that they still managed to qualify for the Champions League despite being again deprived of his services through injury in April and May.

On Sunday, he will be unleashed on Arsenal, who are well aware what to expect. In his first game for Liverpool at the start of last season, the winger scored a breathtaking goal after bursting past two defenders, cutting in from the right and unleashing an unstoppable shot.

‚ÄúI saw the defender (Calum Chambers) coming to me so I tried to slow down. Why? I knew I could go quicker than him. No problem,‚Äù he said in reliving the goal for the Daily Mail.

‚ÄúSo when he thought I was slowing down, I let him come. Within one metre? That was it. I left him back. I stopped running a little bit and then (darts his hand) . . . I go! One metre for me to go quick, then he has no chance to stop me.‚Äù

That goal set the standard for his season. Another 14 Premier League goals have followed, more than any other player for Liverpool, even Coutinho.

Adding the Brazilian‚Äôs quickness of thought in midfield to Mane‚Äôs pace and power up front would make Liverpool even more potent.

When the pair played together at the start of last season, Juergen Klopp‚Äôs side looked unstoppable, a clear indicator as to why Liverpool‚Äôs owners are so insistent the Brazilian will not be sold next week when the transfer window closes.

Turkey‚Äôs prime minister said Wednesday he wants to double trade volume with Vietnam to $4 billion in the next three years as his country seeks to boost cooperation with the Southeast Asian country. Binali Yildirim was making his first visit to Vietnam as prime minister, accompanied by a large business delegation. ‚ÄúI believe that our bilateral trade volume will reach $4 billion by 2020 and that‚Äôs doable,‚Äù Yildirim told reporters during a briefing with his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc. The bilateral trade currently stands at $2 billion a year.

Phuc told reporters the two committed to creating favorable conditions for businesses from both countries to promote mutual trade and investment. ‚ÄúThere are special areas where our mutual cooperation can immediately be initiated, primarily the defense industry,‚Äù Yildirim added.

Details on defense cooperation were not immediately disclosed, but Vietnam has in recently years sought to modernize its military with the purchase of six submarines and new jet fighters from Russia, its traditional weapons supplier, in the face of Chinese assertiveness in pressing Beijing‚Äôs territorial claims in disputed South China Sea waters.

China claims most of the South China Sea, which is believed to sit on rich natural resources and occupies important international sea lanes. The two prime ministers stressed that disputes should be resolved through peaceful means in line with international law.

Decoded: Why expensive wines taste better,"It all has to do with the price tag! (Source: Thinkstock Images) It all has to do with the price tag! (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Expensive wines appear to be tastier, say scientists who have found that a higher price tag on the bottle causes the reward centre in the brain to trick the taste processing regions.

The phenomenon that identical products are perceived differently due to differences in price is called the ‚Äúmarketing placebo effect.‚Äù

As with placebo medications, it has an effect solely due to ascribed properties: ‚ÄúQuality has its price!‚Äù

‚ÄúHowever, it has so far been unclear how the price information ultimately causes more expensive wine to also be perceived as having a better taste in the brain,‚Äù said Bernd Weber, from the University of Bonn in Germany.

The researchers assessed how different prices are translated into corresponding taste experiences in the brain, even if the wine tasted does not differ.

Thirty participants took part in the study, of which 15 were women and 15 were men, with an average age of around 30 years.

The wine tasting took place lying down in an MRI scanner, allowing brain activity to be recorded ‚Äúonline‚Äù while participants were tasting the wines. Each time, the price of the wine was shown first.

Only then around a millilitre of the respective wine was given to the participants via a tube in their mouths. The participants were then asked to rate via a button on a nine-point scale how good the wine tasted to them.

Their mouths were then rinsed with a neutral liquid and the next identical wine sample was given for tasting.

Researchers conducted the tests using an average to good quality red wine with a retail bottle prize of 12 euros.

In the MRI scanner, the price of this wine was shown randomly as 3, 6 and 18 euros.

‚ÄúAs expected, the subjects stated that the wine with the higher price tasted better than an apparently cheaper one,‚Äù said Hilke Plassmann from the INSEAD Business School in France.

Identical wine leads to a better taste experience when a greater quality expectation is associated with the wine due to its price.

The measurements of brain activity in the MRI scanner confirmed this. The research team discovered that above all parts of the medial pre-frontal cortex and also the ventral striatum were activated more when prices were higher.

While the medial pre-frontal cortex particularly appears to be involved in integrating the price comparison and thus the expectation into the evaluation of the wine, the ventral striatum forms part of the brain‚Äôs reward and motivation system.

‚ÄúThe reward and motivation system is activated more significantly with higher prices and apparently increases the taste experience in this way,‚Äù said Weber.

‚ÄúUltimately, the reward and motivation system plays a trick on us,‚Äù said INSEAD post-doctoral fellow Liane Schmidt.

When prices are higher, it leads us to believe that a taste is present that is not only driven by the wine itself, because the products were objectively identical in all of the tastings.

AOC chief John Coates defiant after damning review,"Long-time AOC chief John Coates defiantly said he would not quit following the damning independent review. (Source: Reuters) Long-time AOC chief John Coates defiantly said he would not quit following the damning independent review. (Source: Reuters)

An independent review of the Australian Olympic Committee‚Äôs workplace practices released on Thursday has revealed a dysfunctional culture out of step with the Games‚Äô ideals.

The review, following interviews and surveys with current and former AOC executive members and staff as well as with national sports federations, did not find a bullying culture within the organisation.

But it detailed an environment of ‚Äúsenior leaders undermining each other, working around each other, and openly displaying hostility towards each other‚Äù.

Long-time AOC chief John Coates defiantly said he would not quit following the damning independent review.

‚ÄúWhy should I resign?‚Äù Coates told reporters at a media conference Thursday.

‚ÄúThere has been no confirmation of bullying. There has been some criticism of senior leaders ‚Äî I‚Äôm the president, I‚Äôm not the senior leader that is being criticised.‚Äù

The review also uncovered a disillusionment with the way in which staff and national federations were treated by the AOC.

‚ÄúWhile staff and stakeholders hold the AOC in high regard and express immense pride in what the organisation has achieved over the years, they describe the organisation as being out of step ‚Äî with both their ideals and minimum expectations for a modern organisation,‚Äù the investigation said of its findings.

‚ÄúInstead of seeing the organisation as celebrating the best of the Olympic ideals, staff and stakeholders speak of a more immediate horizon of challenges and difficulties that stem from a culture that is not aligned with the ideals that the organisation aspires to uphold.‚Äù

The review comes in the wake of a stormy period for the AOC, with Coates fighting off a well-backed bid by challenger Danni Roche to remain as the organisation‚Äôs figure-head.

Coates, who has been at the helm for 27 years, won a secret ballot 58-35 in May to continue in his role, but admitted the AOC brand was ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù by the acrimonious campaign.

Dubbed the most powerful individual in Australian sport, Coates has been AOC chief since 1990 and a vice-president of the International Olympic Committee since 2013.

Coates has declared this will be his last three-year term of office and vowed to step down after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

His right-hand man and long-time AOC media director Mike Tancred, who stood down from his job during the presidency campaign, had been previously reprimanded for his conduct regarding ex-AOC chief executive Fiona de Jong.

Tancred was cleared of a bullying allegation made by de Jong but was reprimanded by an separate investigation which found he engaged in disreputable conduct.

De Jong‚Äôs allegation prompted a series of other accusations from former AOC employees as well as concerns among athletes and sports about the culture of the organisation, which led to the independent review.

AOC chief executive Matt Carroll, who started in his role in May, said the organisation would implement all 17 recommendations made to it within the review.

‚ÄúThis review provides us with the platform to reset the organisation,‚Äù Carroll told reporters.

‚ÄúThe AOC‚Äôs modes of operation that may at one time have served us well are being questioned and our organisational culture has come under scrutiny. ‚ÄúThe AOC executive acknowledges the reality of the

challenge we face in this area and we are committed to build a culture that is fit for purpose and aligned to our espoused values and principles.‚Äù

Ian Chesterman, 58, was also announced as Australia‚Äôs chef de mission for the 2020 Tokyo Games, replacing Kitty Chiller, who stood down from the role after last year‚Äôs Rio Olympics.

"Prakash Javadekar: Government planning Rs 75,000 scholarships for 1000 best innovative minds","Prakash Javadekar at an event in New Delhi. File photo Prakash Javadekar at an event in New Delhi. File photo

To encourage research and innovation, the Union Human Resource Development minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday announced that 1000 best innovative minds will get monthly scholarships of Rs 75,000 under the proposed Prime Minister‚Äôs Scholarship scheme.

Speaking at the fourth convocation of Sri Sri University, Javadekar the government is building a better research infrastructure in the country at a cost of Rs 20,000 crore.

‚ÄúIndia lacks in innovation therefore, turn this adversary into your strength‚Äù, Javadekar said. The Union HRD minister also said that his ministry is working towards reducing the University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) control over universities. The intention of the government is to give more autonomy to higher education institutions so that these institutions get more freedom for better education and research.

Speaking on the occasion the founder of the University Sri Sri Ravi Shankar called upon the students to face the challenges of life with smile and confidence.

He said education is not stuffing the mind with information but building a strong personality and inculcating great human values. Sri Sri said his purpose of setting up the University here was to bring the best of East and best of West to this land of Lord Jagannath.

At least 169 graduates and post graduates received their degrees from the dignitaries, of which 11 were awarded gold medals for outstanding performances in seven different courses, including M.Sc in Osteopathy, a method of treating patients by moving bones and muscles supplemented by therapeutic measures.

While Internet Tractor Limited MD Dr Deepak Mittal received honoris causa, three research scholars of the University were awarded PhD degree on the occasion.

Boca threaten legal action over non-payment of Carlos Tevez fee,"Carlos Tevez met with Angelici soon after his arrival in Argentina last week amid rumours he is seeking a third stint at the club. (Source: Reuters) Carlos Tevez met with Angelici soon after his arrival in Argentina last week amid rumours he is seeking a third stint at the club. (Source: Reuters)

Boca Juniors president Daniel Angelici has threatened to take Shanghai Shenhua to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to demand payment of more than $3 million related to the transfer of striker Carlos Tevez.

Tevez joined Shenhua in January for a transfer fee in the region of 11 million euros ($12.96 million) and Angelici claims the Chinese side have not paid the Argentine club since the initial payment was made when the transfer was completed.

‚ÄúWe are preparing a claim to present to the Court of Arbitration for Sport because we have written several times to the club and have had no response,‚Äù Angelici told local media, claiming Shenhua owed Boca more than $3 million.

The 33-year-old former Manchester United and Juventus forward is currently in Buenos Aires for treatment on a calf injury that has seen him miss much of his first season in China.

Tevez has played just 11 times in the Chinese Super League since his highly anticipated arrival ahead of the current season, scoring two goals as Shenhua have struggled.

He was granted leave to return to Argentina after signing an agreement with the club guaranteeing he would return before the resumption of the Chinese Super League following the upcoming international break.

Tevez met with Angelici soon after his arrival in Argentina last week amid rumours he is seeking a third stint at the club.

‚ÄúTevez had lunch with the president of Boca? Well, we know nothing about that,‚Äù a spokesman for Shenhua said.

‚ÄúHe is now on holiday, he has the right to meet anyone he wants to, this is his freedom. We won‚Äôt comment on something like that, let alone interfere with it. ‚ÄúBut we want to stress again that he will report to the club on August 30.‚Äù

The name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds most people of melodious voices of Noor Jahan and Nayyara Noor, and the songs Mujh Se Pahli Si Muhobbat Meri Mehboob Na Mang, Ham Dekhenge or Aaj Bazar Mein Paa-ba Jolan Chalo. For those who have a deeper interest in Urdu poetry, it evokes many more images.

Above all, the name Faiz Ahmad Faiz reminds us that the partition of a country fails to divide music, visual arts, poetry and literature. No nation state has been able to create impermeable fortifications thick enough to withstand the osmotic pressure which arts and literature produces. Even if these walls are constructed on the dense bedrock of hate and animosity.

Faiz‚Äôs poetry kept on transcending geographical boundaries and made him the most celebrated poet of the Indian subcontinent. But what makes Faiz unique, and I have said this earlier in an article, is that his poetry also transcends caste, class, regional and even linguistic boundaries. It is not unusual to see processions in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, where workers, students or political activists walk on streets with posters on which Bol Ke Lab Azaad Hain Tere or Nisar Main Teri Galyon Pe Aye Watan Ke Jahan, Chali Hai Rasm Ke Koi Na Sar Uttha Ke Chale is written. If you walk into a five star hotel and witness Faiz being sung by a renowned singer, it would not be considered out of the ordinary. Faiz is the only poet who has no adversaries. Even the mullahs in Pakistan did not pass a fatwa against him.

Faiz‚Äôs name also reminds us of the great divide between taraqqi pasand (the progressives) and jadidiyat pasand (modernists). Those who called themselves modernists in India were essentially anti-communist, backed by international groups who professed ‚Äòart for the sake of art‚Äô and ‚Äòart with no political objective‚Äô. This group consistently attacked all writers, poets, filmmakers and artists who were members of PWA. Their politics drove them to condemn and reject all those who were committed to the idea of equality and justice, and created literature to build consciousness around these ideals.

Faiz demolished the wall created by the modernists. They initially tried to ignore him but did not succeed. In an Urdu magazine, Tehrik (Silver Jubilee Number), Wazir Agha wrote an article on ‚Äò25 years of Urdu literature in Pakistan‚Äô. He listed the names of 30 poets, without mentioning Faiz. In passing elsewhere in the article, he mentioned Faiz as a progressive poet who ‚Äúdid not toe the party line and therefore created some good literary pieces‚Äù.

Similarly in Guftugoo, Balraj Komal, in an article titled ‚ÄòPoetry of Straight and Curvilinear Lines‚Äô, placed Faiz‚Äôs work on the border of this divide vis-a-vis Ali Sardar Jafri, Sahir Ludhyanvi and Josh Malihabadi; and, therefore categorised it as ‚Äòeffective‚Äô. These assertions were utterly false because Faiz remained committed to the ideals of socialism till his last breath. These were only excuses for liking a revolutionary poet. Almost every word of his poetry is dedicated to the idea of building an equitable and just society, yet his grandeur was accepted by even those who stood on the other side of the political fence.

The book Faiz Ahmad Faiz: Colour of My Heart, Selected Poems provides yet more proof of my assertion. In her introduction, the translator, Baran Farooqui, has made her political position very clear. She has referred to Faiz and many other progressive writers as ‚Äúarmchair socialists‚Äù, ignoring the fact that some of them, including Faiz, spent long years in jail for their ideological commitment. An unnecessary reference to Stalin could also have been avoided. She has not minced her words to reveal her unsympathetic attitude towards Faiz‚Äôs political views. The rest of the introduction is full of ‚Äòilluminating‚Äô information and she has translated the poems with utmost care, restrain and thoughtfulness. The soft, firm and robust ‚Äòking of romantic realism‚Äô deserves no less, even from those who do not agree with him. The ideological bias is completely absent in the translation.

When I read the list of 57 selected poems I was a bit disappointed that Intisab, Raqeeb Se, and Mauzu-e-Sukhan were missing. But when I moved on to the introduction it was clear that these poems did not measure up to the taste of the selector for obvious reasons.

If you are in love with a piece of literature in its original form ‚Äî and I am an unashamed lover of every poem that Faiz wrote ‚Äî then it is painful to read its translation. For me there are two indicators of good translation. The first test is: choose lines from the middle of a poem, read, and if you are able to recollect the original, then it is a good translation. I performed this test on every poem in this book. The second test is: the translated poem must invoke the same or similar feeling which the original does. Farooqi‚Äôs translation passes both these tests with very high marks. For all those who understand Urdu but cannot read ‚Äòfarsi rasm-ul khat‚Äô the appendix provides transliteration of all selected poems, carefully scripted with the correct pronunciation of each word.

Farooqi refers to seven translators who introduced Faiz to non-Urdu readers, during his lifetime. I have not read all of them, but on the basis of whatever I‚Äôve gone through, Farooqi‚Äôs translation is incredibly close to the spirit of Faiz‚Äôs poetry. I‚Äôm sure after reading this book, non-Urdu-Hindi readers will gain a deeper understanding of his life and poetry.

New railway board chief Ashwani Lohani ‚Äôs mantra: Energise ranks,"Ashwani Lohani, new Chairman of Railway Board. Ashwani Lohani, new Chairman of Railway Board.

NEW RAILWAY Board Chairman Ashwani Lohani will visit a railway station to interact with field staff and passengers on Friday, something chairmen are not known to do. Those who have worked with Lohani in the railways say this is his working style ‚Äî energising the ranks for performance by personally reaching out to workers, down to the lowest level. On Wednesday evening when news of the approval from Cabinet‚Äôs Appointments Committee came, senior officials in Air India, according to eye-witnesses, started crying. Lohani was the Chairman and MD of Air India.

‚ÄúI am sad to be leaving Air India. I wish them all the best,‚Äù Lohani told The Indian Express. ‚ÄúI will visit a station on Friday.‚Äù A day after the Khatauli accident, Lohani posted on Facebook his take on what is wrong with the Railways. ‚ÄúThe tragic railway disaster is a glaring symptom of the crying need for structural and process reforms cutting across hierarchies down upto the ground level that this great organisation needs, along with a genuine focus on HR. Indeed a very sad day,‚Äù he wrote.

Lohani‚Äôs departure from the railways three years ago was as dramatic as his comeback. The departure was the result of a feud between factions in the Railways‚Äôs mechanical department. Lohani, a 1980 officer of the Indian Railway Service of Mechanical Engineers, was not allowed to take the post of Secretary, Railway Board, in 2014 by a section that controlled the railway bureaucracy and Lohani‚Äôs department then.

Around this time, a number of multinational giants in the field of rolling stock manufacturing offered him lucrative positions, it was heard, but Lohani refused. Departmental rivalry ensured Lohani‚Äôs experience remained underutilised. At this juncture, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan requested Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu to relieve Lohani so he could oversee Madhya Pradesh Tourism. It was from here that Lohani went to Air India.

The Indian Express is privy to the fact that every possible hurdle was created by the then prevailing bureaucracy in the Railways to process the paperwork for Lohani‚Äôs deputation, including raising an objection to Lohani‚Äôs contribution to newspapers, saying it ran afoul of service rules.

Lohani was also ‚Äúcounselled‚Äù ‚Äî an administrative action ‚Äî when local staff failed to lay the red carpet for then minister Mallikarjun Kharge in the Lucknow division. He was the Chief Mechanical Engineer of Northern Railway, stationed in Delhi at that time. Lohani was then made to head the Indian Railway Organisation for Alternative Fuels in East Delhi‚Äôs Laxmi Nagar, which has little to do with core railway operations.

Incidentally, when the Comptroller and Auditor-General came out with its audit report on the Commonwealth Games in 2010, the Delhi division with Lohani as its Divisional Railway Manager got the most praise for the management of work.

Other two types of talaq also challenge to gender justice: P Chidambaram,"P Chidambaram P Chidambaram

A DAY after the Supreme Court struck down the instant triple talaq, senior Congress leader and former Union Minister P Chidambaram on Wednesday said the other two types of talaq that exist are also a ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù to gender justice and gender equality. ‚ÄúGreater clarity today. Only instant triple talaq is illegal. Other two kinds are also a challenge to gender justice and gender equality,‚Äù Chidambaram tweeted.

The Congress refused to comment on the tweet. Party‚Äôs communication department head Randeep Surjewala said, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen any such tweet.‚Äù Chidambaram said the majority judgment striking down instant triple talaq was a resounding affirmation of gender justice and of equality of spouses. ‚ÄúTriple talaq was a distortion of original Quranic legal principles. Good it has been declared unconstitutional,‚Äù he said.

Chidambaram‚Äôs party colleague M Veerappa Moily had differed with the party on Tuesday, saying that Parliament will have to pass a legislation to give effect to the apex court order. The Congress, however, had argued there was no need to bring a law.

A Place Called Home,"Sana Nasir‚Äôs illustration titled The Inside-Out Place. Sana Nasir‚Äôs illustration titled The Inside-Out Place.

Delhi-based artist Pakhi Sen has spent a large part of her life in the coastal landscape of Goa, in a home with ceramic tiles, surrounded with forests, where light filtered through glass panels to create patterns. She remembers reading in her large verandah with the music of American jazz saxophonist John Coltrane playing in her head. In her work titled The Old Pereira House, she paints two images of Goa ‚Äî one being what she imagines a perfect Goan house to be, and the other based on her recollections, a composition with negative colours and blurred boundaries.

Sen is one of the 12 artists who have explored the ‚Äúidea of home‚Äù in the first physical exhibition, titled ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, organised by The Pind Collective, an online collaborative platform that brings together artists from India and Pakistan, to share art, poetry, movies, illustrations and stories on common themes. ‚ÄúInitially, we connected with contemporaries in India whose work we like and respect. We then connected with artists in Pakistan through friends,‚Äù says Avani Tandon Vieira. The 22-year-old writer co-founded the collective with filmmaker Ansh Ranvir Vohra in July 2016.

While Vieira looks after the text, Vohra takes care of the visuals and collaborates with artists. His movie, Fazal Ka Bangla, is also being screened at the exhibition in Delhi, where he has shared memories of the Partition narrated by his maternal grandmother, Nirmal Chawla, who migrated from Pakistan to India in 1947. ‚ÄúWe also asked artists to create works in response to what others had done,‚Äù says Vohra, 24. In response to his movie, Sana Nasir, a Pakistani artist, has created an illustration titled The Inside-Out Place, that compares Chawla‚Äôs journey to India with her own grandmother‚Äôs journey to Pakistan. Similarly, Delhi-based poet Sthira Bhattacharya has responded to Sen‚Äôs painting with a poem, Surrounded, where she has explored spaces that lie between home and the unknown ‚Äî lush vegetation, unweeded gardens, rubble and ant hills.

Fawad Khan, a dastango in Pakistan, has filmed himself narrating a short story, Haveli, written by Urdu humourist, Mushtaq Ahmed Yusufi, where Qibla, a short-tempered, well-built man, who thought everyone else is beneath him, had to leave his haveli in Kanpur after Partition. Similarly, in Dairy of a Vagabond/Jis Desh Main Ganga Behti Hai, Karachi-based historian Sarah Hashmi, has sketched structures of homes left behind in India by refugees to Pakistan.

‚ÄúThe idea of the project came up after I visited Lahore for a debate competition in 2013, and realised how culturally similar both the countries are,‚Äù says Vieira. The postgraduate in English literature from the University of Oxford teaches Young India Fellowship students at Ashoka University. ‚ÄúOne year ago we didn‚Äôt really think that we would be holding a physical exhibition, and we don‚Äôt know where this project would be a year later,‚Äù says Vohra, who will soon relocate to New York for a filmmaking fellowship by Uniondocs Collaborative Studio. The Delhi-based duo, meanwhile, is also looking forward to an online exhibition based on ‚Äúresistance‚Äù. The line-up of artists will be revealed soon.

The exhibition ends today at Khoj Studios, S-17, Khirkee Extension

Alexis Sanchez set for Arsenal return after summer of speculation,"Alexis Sanchez had missed the first three games of the season. (Source: AP File) Alexis Sanchez had missed the first three games of the season. (Source: AP File)

The last time Arsenal visited Anfield in the Premier League, Arsene Wenger made the stunning decision to drop top scorer Alexis Sanchez to the bench. To some, the selection signaled the beginning of the end of Sanchez‚Äôs time at the London club: The in-demand Chilean had little over a year left on his contract and Arsenal was about to miss out on Champions League qualification for the first time in two decades. Now he wasn‚Äôt even in the team amid reports of a training-ground dispute.

Five months later, Arsenal will return to Liverpool on Sunday with Wenger set to make another big statement regarding his only world-class player.

After missing the first three games of the season ‚Äì officially because of an abdominal injury but also amid sustained talk of interest from Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City ‚Äì Sanchez is expected to be back in Arsenal‚Äôs lineup for the team‚Äôs most high-profile match in the league so far.

Wenger has said repeatedly this summer that Sanchez will not be leaving during this transfer window, even though that would likely mean the player walking away for free at the end of the season. Given that Arsenal could potentially receive 60 million pounds ($77 million) for Sanchez if the club opted to sell him, it‚Äôs a big call by Wenger. It appears Wenger is sticking to his word.

‚ÄúHe has always been focused on his job,‚Äù Wenger said of Sanchez. ‚ÄúHe loves to play football and I don‚Äôt think he is too disturbed by all the noises that happen.

‚ÄúPlayers at that level are used to it now _ some deal better with it than others, but I don‚Äôt think he is too bothered by that.‚Äù

Indeed, in this summer of unrest in English soccer, some of the top players in the Premier League have struggled to deal with being the subject of interest from other clubs.

Gylfi Sigurdsson didn‚Äôt go on a preseason tour with Swansea or feature on the opening weekend of the league season amid interest from Everton, which eventually signed the midfielder. Dutch center back Virgil van Dijk, a reported target of Liverpool among others, has been training alone at Southampton after handing in a transfer request.

Brazil playmaker Philippe Coutinho will likely be missing at Anfield this weekend while he is at the center of a fight over his services between current club Liverpool and Barcelona. He has lodged a transfer request, too, and officially is unavailable because of illness and a back injury.

Yet with Sanchez, there has been no public bitterness. There were some cryptic comments in June while at the Confederations Cup with Chile, when he said he didn‚Äôt know if he would be at Arsenal for this season even though he had made his mind up on his future.

But he‚Äôs been quiet since then, and Wenger has had to answer questions about Sanchez‚Äôs future at every news conference since.

After beating Chelsea in the Community Shield at Wembley Stadium, Arsenal needed late goals to win 4-3 against Leicester on the opening day and then lost 1-0 at Stoke last weekend. The Gunners should be a different proposition now that Sanchez is back.

‚ÄúAlexis has worked very hard to be back again and he is available,‚Äù said Wenger. ‚ÄúHe works very hard, is focused and gives absolutely everything. He loves to play so much that it is sometimes difficult to stop him but he looks absolutely ready.‚Äù

Three teams have maximum points in the Premier League after two games. It is no real shock that Manchester United is one of them _ the leaders host Leicester on Saturday _ but the other two may come as a surprise.

Huddersfield was expected to be a relegation candidate in its first season in the top flight for 45 years, but is already six points closer to survival after wins at Crystal Palace and at home to Newcastle.

West Bromwich Albion, meanwhile, struggled at the end of last season and didn‚Äôt make a huge splash in the transfer market during the offseason. Still, it has beaten Bournemouth and Burnley already.

Huddersfield hosts Southampton on Saturday and West Brom is at home to Stoke on Sunday.

Talk of a so-called ‚ÄúWembley Curse‚Äù will hang over Tottenham until the team starts to pick up victories at its temporary home for the season. The visit of Burnley is as good an opportunity as any to bury the jinx.

After losing 2-1 to Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday, Tottenham‚Äôs record at the national stadium since it reopened in 2007 reads: Played 11; won two, drawn two, lost seven.

Burnley may have beaten Chelsea away on the opening weekend, but had one of the worst away records in the league last season.

Spurs are playing at Wembley while a new 61,000-seat stadium is being rebuilt on the site of its long-time home at White Hart Lane.

Taliban suicide bomber kills five civilians in Afghanistan,"The attack occurred a little over 24 hours after Trump cleared the way for thousands more US soldiers to be sent to Afghanistan, reversing earlier pledges to pull out. The attack occurred a little over 24 hours after Trump cleared the way for thousands more US soldiers to be sent to Afghanistan, reversing earlier pledges to pull out.

A Taliban suicide bomber killed five civilians and wounded dozens of others, mainly children, when he detonated a car filled with explosives at a police headquarters in southern Afghanistan on Wednesday.

It was the insurgents‚Äô first major attack since US President Donald Trump announced in Washington late Monday that he was committing American troops to the war-torn country indefinitely. ‚ÄúA suicide bomber detonated an explosive-filled car in a parking lot near the main police headquarters in Lashkar Gah,‚Äù Omar Zhwak, a spokesman for the governor of Helmand province, told AFP.

‚ÄúOur initial information shows that five civilians were killed and 25 were wounded, including women and children,‚Äù he added.

The car park was full of people queueing to get into the police headquarters when the explosion happened, said Zhwak.

He added that a nearby mosque, which was being used as a madrassa or Islamic religious school, had been been damaged. Children were studying there at the time. ‚ÄúWe have received 38 wounded ‚Äî mostly schoolchildren ‚Äìand five dead, including two women and two soldiers,‚Äù Mauladad Tabihdad, director of hospitals in Helmand, told AFP.

The attack occurred a little over 24 hours after Trump cleared the way for thousands more US soldiers to be sent to Afghanistan, reversing earlier pledges to pull out.

The Taliban had called for a complete withdrawal of foreign forces and following Trump‚Äôs announcement vowed to make the war-weary country a ‚Äúgraveyard‚Äù for US forces.

The Taliban quickly claimed today‚Äôs attack in a text message sent to journalists. ‚ÄúWe targeted army tanks, killing dozens,‚Äù it read.

Ordinary Afghans have paid a heavy price for the 16-year US-led war.

Civilian deaths are at their worst since records began in 2009. In the first half of the year, 1,662 civilians were killed and more than 3,500 injured, according to the United Nations.

The attack was also the latest blow to Afghanistan‚Äôs beleaguered security forces. ‚ÄúThe car bomb targeted a number of army vehicles parked in the parking lot. We have reports of some casualties to army soldiers,‚Äù Salam Afghan, a police spokesman, told AFP.

The resurgent Taliban have been ramping up their campaign against government forces, underscoring rising insecurity in Afghanistan during the summer fighting season when the warmer weather tends to spur an increase in attacks.

Afghan police and troops ‚Äî beset by a high death toll, desertions and non-existent ‚Äúghost soldiers‚Äù on the payroll ‚Äìhave been struggling to beat back the insurgents since US-led NATO troops ended their combat mission in December 2014.

Casualties among Afghan security forces soared by 35 percent in 2016, with 6,800 soldiers and police killed, according to US watchdog SIGAR.

More than 2,500 Afghan police and troops were killed from January 1 to May 8.

"Two dead, children trapped after quake hits Italian holiday island of Ischia","People standing near a collapsed building following an earthquake in Casamicciola on the Italian resort island of Ischia. An earthquake rattled the island at the peak of tourist season Monday night. (@percy80 via AP) People standing near a collapsed building following an earthquake in Casamicciola on the Italian resort island of Ischia. An earthquake rattled the island at the peak of tourist season Monday night. (@percy80 via AP)

A magnitude-4.0 earthquake struck the Italian holiday island of Ischia, causing destruction that left two people dead at peak tourist season, authorities said, as rescue workers struggled on Tuesday to free two children from the rubble.

A woman was killed in Casamicciola, in the north of the small tourist island, hit by debris that fell from a church, with the body of another spotted in the rubble of a collapsed house, local media reported. Around 4am (0200 GMT) emergency workers rescued a seven-month-old baby, crying but alive, after hours of effort. They were still struggling to free the baby‚Äôs two brothers, who were alive but trapped and communicating with emergency services through the rubble, according to Naples prefecture.

According to local media, the two children, aged 4 and 7, are trapped under a bed but are in touch with rescue workers by phone. It was their pregnant mother, healthy and safe, who raised the alarm. The father was rescued at 2:30am (0130 GMT).

‚ÄúIn Casamicciola, a building collapsed and three people were pulled alive from the rubble ‚Äî two women and a man,‚Äù the head of the local department of civil protection, Angelo Borrelli, said at a press conference early Tuesday. Two small communes, Casamicciola and neighbouring Lacco Ameno, had borne the brunt of the quake, he added.

The tremor hit the northwest of the island at 8:57 pm (1957 GMT), with a depth of some 10 kilometres. Italian authorities first put Monday‚Äôs quake at 3.6, but subsequently revised it upward to 4.0 magnitude. The main earthquake was followed by 14 smaller aftershocks, Borrelli said. Several buildings in the area collapsed and others had large, ominous cracks.

The Rai News 24 television channel broadcast images of holidaymakers by their cars with their bags packed, with other people sitting in their gardens or outside their houses. According to local media, many cars were waiting at Ischia port eager to head back to Naples as soon as possible. One ferry left at 2:30 am and another was scheduled for two hours later.

The quake struck just days ahead of the first anniversary of the 6.0 magnitude quake that killed nearly 300 people in and around Amatrice in central Italy. In October 2016 and January 2017 three other earthquakes hit the same region. ‚ÄúI was on the couch watching TV. Blackout, shaking, something fell on my head. I scream, my mother grabs me and we ran outside,‚Äù one witness wrote on Twitter.

The quake response has benefited from the presence of emergency responders who happened to already be on the island to fight the forest fires that have plagued Italy this summer, local media said. Teams of firefighters, including two units specialised in extracting people from the rubble, were quickly mobilised, said Bruno Frattasi, who oversees the fire department.

Ischia‚Äôs only hospital was also hit and had to be partially evacuated. Five patients were evacuated to another medical facility by helicopter. Restaurants were packed and many stores were still open when the shaking began, witnesses said on Twitter. ‚ÄúA horrible experience, everything was shaking, plunged into darkness, houses were collapsing‚Ä¶ a nightmare,‚Äù a witness wrote on Twitter. Electricity was restored after just a few minutes, but many people stayed outdoors after the quake, reluctant to go inside.

Ischia has been a frequent victim of earthquakes, with its worst dating back over a century. Estimated at a magnitude of 5.8, it killed over 2,000 people in July 1883. Much of Italy‚Äôs land mass and some of its surrounding waters are prone to seismic activity with the highest risk concentrated along its mountainous central spine. Italy straddles the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, making it vulnerable to seismic activity when they move.

FC Goa signs Spanish winger Manuel Lanzarote,"Manuel Lanzarote has joined FC Goa. (Source: FC Goa website) Manuel Lanzarote has joined FC Goa. (Source: FC Goa website)

FC Goa today confirmed the signing of Spanish winger Manuel Lanzarote for the upcoming season of the Hero Indian Super League, becoming Sergio Lobera‚Äôs sixth foreign recruit.

The winger who was last plying his trade for Real Zaragoza in the second division of Spain.

A product of the La Masia, Lanzarote largely operates from the right wing but can also play in a more central attacking midfield position and on the wide left. With over 35 goals in the top two divisions of Spanish football, Lanzarote brings a wealth of experience with him and is expected to play a vital part in the Gaurs‚Äô charge for the title.

Having spent a majority of his career in Spain with the likes of Zaragoza, Espanyol, Deportivo Alaves and Eibar among a few, this will be Lanzarote‚Äôs second foray outside of Spain having previously turned out for Asteras Tripolis in Greece where he was a part of their Europa League campaign.

Having beaten several ISL clubs in the race to his signature, the Goan club will be hopeful Lanzarote can reproduce his form from the previous season where he scored six goals and assisted a further eight in Zaragoza‚Äôs campaign.

With Lanzarote‚Äôs signature, FC Goa‚Äôs compliment of foreigners is now upto six having signed the likes of Bruno Pinheiro, Ahmed Jahouh, Ferran Corominas, Manuel Arana and Sergio Juste previously.

"Postpartum Depression: What Is It, And How To Deal With It",
No Fond Return of Love,"Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part. Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part.

Title: Men Without Women

Author: Haruki Murakami

Publishers: Harvill Secker/Penguin Random House

228 pages

‚ÄúLoneliness seeps deep down inside your body, like a red-wine stain on a pastel carpet,‚Äù says the narrator of the titular story of Men Without Women. The men in c‚Äôs heart-rending new book of short stories are all stained ‚Äî be it by loneliness, their deficiencies or the phantom pain from a wonderfully innocent first love. These indelible marks act as a common strand as the author plays through all seven stories, hitting blue notes aplenty along the way.

In the ever-changing world of Murakami‚Äôs writing, there are a few assurances ‚Äî most characters will have musical tastes ranging from Schubert to The Beatles, solace is often found in bars and good food, cats are a shining ray of hope in a universe that rations it out grudgingly. The most important assurance, however, is that happiness and meaning will be hard to find and even harder to keep.

For many characters, the search that ensues is the driving force that pushes their fractured selves forward. Such a quest ‚Äî be it literal as in The Wind Up Bird Chronicles (1997), or metaphorical, as with Kafka on the Shore (2005) ‚Äî is often the only hint of proactivity in an otherwise bland, almost dispassionate, array of protagonists. The latest collection begins with Drive My Car ‚Äî a reference to The Beatles and the story of Kafuku, a middle-aged actor and widower, whose wife had affairs throughout the span of their marriage. Tortured by the knowledge of the affairs, what Kafuku seeks more than anything else is to know why. Such a curiousity is, in Murakami‚Äôs world, a powerful, arbitrary force devoid of a place on any moral scale.

Perhaps, one of the biggest triumphs of the book is the ease with which Murakami indulges in tragicomedy, maneuvering between the two genres effortlessly. In The Independent Organ, the protagonist speaks of successful cosmetic surgeon Dr Tokai. A 52-year-old confirmed bachelor, Tokai is content to remain ‚Äúthe casual number-two lover, a convenient rainy-day boyfriend, a handy partner for a casual fling‚Äù. That is, until, he falls in love with a young, married woman, who eventually ends their affair, leaving the doctor to grapple desperately with a suffocating sense of loss for the very first time. The narrator mocks and empathises with Tokai in equal measure ‚Äî this narrative tone prevaricates between dark and light in stories such as Kino or Yesterday as well.

While a Murakami short story can be seen as a condensed version of his much lengthier novels, earlier collections such as The Elephant Vanishes (1993) seem to wrestle with challenges in form, struggling not to sacrifice pace for form or flair for substance. Men Without Women comes across as a refined product of those attempts, pitch-perfect for the most part. This is not to suggest a dearth of experiments, however. Two particularly intriguing tales ‚Äî Scheherazade and Samsa in Love ‚Äî are also among the more fantastical and dream-like. The former falls into the category of works such as Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World (1985), in that key plot elements can be seen as representative of the narrative structure.

The story that best puts the ‚Äúmagical‚Äù in magical realism is Samsa in Love, a play on Franz Kafka‚Äôs The Metamorphosis (1915). Thrust into an ‚Äúill-formed, fragile, ludicrous‚Äù human body, an insect must come to terms with his new physical and metaphysical realities. The narration is languid and almost directionless at points, as it explores Samsa being thrust into the world of human interactions with the arrival of a hunchbacked female locksmith at the house he is in, with little idea of even the concept of lust or romantic interest.

When it comes to a central component in Murakami‚Äôs exploration of loneliness and curiosity, which are, by nature, deeply intertwined with notions of love and lust, a level of indulgence on the part of readers is undoubtedly necessary. Within the Americanophilic, dream-like worlds that the author builds, there is a thin line between the confidently-paced and ‚Äúget to the point already!‚Äù This line tends to be a divisive one, placing most readers firmly in one camp or the other.

Those who find the indulgence to stroll along this narrative path, however, will likely find themselves in a space one character refers to as the ‚Äúunrealness of reality‚Äù. Left adrift here, in the beguiling space where the author thrives, readers will have to find their own way out. A few, if they‚Äôre lucky enough, might chance across a cat or two along the way.

Autumn of the Patriarch,"Actor Naseeruddin Shah in scene from the play The Father. Actor Naseeruddin Shah in scene from the play The Father.

About a year ago, Naseeruddin Shah received a call from Paresh Rawal, who was overwhelmed by the theatrical production of French playwright Florian Zeller‚Äôs The Father that he watched during a trip to America. Rawal had even managed to obtain a copy of the play. However, before handing it over to Shah, the actor-turned parliamentarian wished to extract the promise that the former would direct this play. Shah, who recounts this with a chuckle, says, ‚ÄúWhen I read it, I was totally floored. On the surface, it is a family drama. But it is the study of a man who used to be perfectly normal, healthy, reasonable and authoritative. His daughter hero-worshipped him. He has reached a stage when he is dependent on others. The play examines his deterioration‚Äù.

Shah, who recounts this with a chuckle, says, ‚ÄúWhen I read it, I was totally floored. On the surface, it is a family drama. But it is the study of a man who used to be perfectly normal, healthy, reasonable and authoritative. His daughter hero-worshipped him. He has reached a stage when he is dependent on others. The play examines his deterioration‚Äù.

Once Shah decided to create a theatrical production of The Father by his group Motley, the first thing he did was to call up Khushroo Suntook, chairman of the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA), Mumbai, and book its Experimental Theatre for the month of September. Next, he booked Mumbai‚Äôs Prithvi Theatre from October 21 to November 17. While performing at Experimental Theatre, The Father team would take a break once a week; at Prithvi it would have an uninterrupted run. Such a long outing of an experimental play is unusual in India, where after the play‚Äôs opening, there is often a long interval between the shows. Worse, many productions close after about 20 shows. So, for Shah, The Father‚Äôs two-month run is a dream come true. ‚ÄúEver since my dream of becoming a professional actor crystallized, and even before that happened, I had read that plays in the West sometimes ran for years. It seemed too good to be true that the actors in these plays trod the boards every single night,‚Äù he says.

It seemed too good to be true that the actors in these plays trod the boards every single night,‚Äù he says.

There have been many plays and movies about people suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs. What‚Äôs most interesting for Shah is that the play is a ‚Äútragic farce‚Äù. According to Shah, who plays the character of Andre, an Alzheimer‚Äôs patient living with his daughter and son-in-law, the drama, rather than creating sympathy in the audience for the central character, acquaints them with what‚Äôs going on in his mind. When Shah read the play, he had a vision for it: there will be no sets or entries and exits. Just a ground plan of two rooms and a door demarcated on the floor. The props are imaginary too. The director-actor hoped to create a kind of disjointed reality. He has also done away with the traditional proscenium setting. ‚ÄúThe audience will be seated on all four sides,‚Äù says the 68-year-old thespian when we meet during the lunch break at the rehearsals‚Äô space in Yashwantrao Centre in Mumbai.

Is the form of the play Motley‚Äôs big experiment? Or, is it the decision to stage it every evening? ‚ÄúBoth,‚Äù says Shah and adds, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm certain about the experiments with the production. In acting classes, we do a lot of

exercises of imagination. When the action of handling an imaginary object is performed correctly, you will never find a disagreement among the observers as to what this actor was doing,‚Äù he says, and to demonstrate it he takes a gulp from an imaginary cup of tea. ‚ÄúIf you can stimulate the audience‚Äôs imagination, there is no magic like that on stage,‚Äù

he adds.

The play itself has a disconnected narrative. The scenes jump back and forth. Yet, Shah believes that it won‚Äôt be difficult for the audience to follow what‚Äôs happening. ‚ÄúThey will be left with the feeling that they don‚Äôt know what happened. That‚Äôs what any family that has an Alzheimer patient feels,‚Äù says Shah. He adds, ‚ÄúIt is the form that fascinated me. It was not the temptation to essay the role of an Alzheimer‚Äôs patient. Otherwise, I could have done King Lear, which is a study of Alzheimer‚Äôs in a way.‚Äù

Is The Father a commercially viable option to have a long run? ‚ÄúThe nature of this play is such that I want the actors to be completely focussed. It requires a lot of concentration as their actions have to match the corresponding sound. For example, there will be no bottle or glass but the sound of wine being poured,‚Äù he says, adding that the play‚Äôs lighting is ‚Äúvery critical‚Äù. He is confident that the cast will benefit immensely from the experience of doing a show every evening. ‚ÄúThis is an experience I wish to create even though I might lose a lot of money,‚Äù he says. The play, co-directed by Ratna Pathak Shah, features her in the cast along with Heeba Shah, Saahil Vaid, Bhavna Pani, Aahana Kumra, Neeraj Kabi, Faisal Rashid and Trishla Patel.

Though the play is disturbing, Shah is confident that it would make for ‚Äúa very dramatic evening of theatre‚Äù. On a

lighter vein, the thespian hopes to survive the next two months of demanding theatre as his role is not double cast, unlike other characters. After The Father‚Äôs November run, he wants to take up something lighter. Most likely, he will work on Ismat Apa Ke Naam 3. ‚ÄúI have already zeroed in on three of Ismat Chughtai‚Äôs stories for the new show. This show would be about joyous storytelling.‚Äù

Jean-Michael Seri coy over Barcelona talk,"Jean-Michael Seri was staying coy on talk of a big-money move to Barcelona. Jean-Michael Seri was staying coy on talk of a big-money move to Barcelona.

Nice midfielder Jean-Michael Seri was staying coy on talk of a big-money move to Barcelona amid reports he has already reached agreement on the terms of a contract with the Spanish giants.

The 26-year-old Ivory Coast international played for Nice in their 2-0 defeat to Napoli on Tuesday that saw them miss out on a place in the Champions League group stage as they lost their play-off tie 4-0 on aggregate.

‚ÄúNo it was not my last match for Nice. I will be at Amiens on Saturday,‚Äù said Seri, who sports daily L‚ÄôEquipe reported had agreed a four-year deal with Barcelona over the weekend.

A transfer for up to 40 million euros (USD 47 million, ¬£36.7 million) has been mooted as the Catalans desperately look to strengthen their squad with the proceeds of Neymar‚Äôs world record 222 million-euro move to Paris Saint-Germain.

But Nice have reportedly been reluctant to negotiate so far and Seri added: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know much about it. I said to everyone to leave me to concentrate on the Champions League and that after we would see if I stayed or went.‚Äù

Seri joined Nice in 2015 from the Portuguese club Pacos de Ferreira and has been outstanding in the last two seasons as the French side have finished fourth and then third in Ligue 1

"GST not a dampener for Ganesh festival, say idol sellers","Ahead of Ganeshotsav, city-based artist Satish Taru sculpts different

personalities, including Narendra Modi, Aamir Khan. Sandeep Daundkar Ahead of Ganeshotsav, city-based artist Satish Taru sculpts differentpersonalities, including Narendra Modi, Aamir Khan. Sandeep Daundkar

City artisans say the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has not impacted the prices of either the idols or decorative material this Ganesh festival. Mangal Gore, owner of Shree Samarth Kripa Crafts, said, ‚ÄúI have been setting up a stall of Ganesha idols for the last 14 years.

However, fearing GST, many presumed that even the rates of our goods would go up. But‚Ä¶ our supply has remained affordable and wide ranging.‚Äù

This has surely come as a welcome relief for buyers, many of whom had anticipated sharp price rises post GST.

Echoing the views of many buyers, Dr Rashmi Verma, said, ‚ÄúWe had come to the market around 10 am, but seeing the crowd, we decided to look deeper in Bori Ali. The market had all the items we required ‚Äî hardened thermocol for archway, bundles of ropes, flowers and of course, local spices and food items. Thankfully, GST has affected the prices of these products. There has been, in fact, no change in our expenditure from last year.‚Äù

This year, most of the sellers have also replaced chemical thermocol and other synthetic products with environment-friendly and easily-dissolvable idols, which are, though a little costly, but hardly affect the budget, she added.

Gore said, ‚ÄúPreviously, the idols could take anything from upto a day or month to dissolve. So, overall, ecological idols have been a smart invention.‚Äù

Shop owners also pointed out at the preference for Indian products, rather than Chinese goods this year.

Malik Sheikh from Karim‚Äô Handcraft Associate, said, ‚ÄúNeither have we received any specific order for Chinese products, nor have we requested them from our suppliers. Besides, artisans have also been exploring various ways to make the idols using homegrown resources. Colours of the idols, too, are produced in Kolhapur, using natural ingredients, not chemicals. We have also started using plaster of paris, which is cheaper than the chemically-hardened thermocol imported from China.‚Äù

With the introduction of e-wallet and cab-hiring services, transactions, too, have become faster. Anita Deshpande, another vendor, said, ‚ÄúAajkal hum Paytm bhi lete hai (We have started accepting payment through Paytm).

People come in groups to make purchases. There is, of course, the growth of incoming traffic, but this is only healthy business for us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are able to take money faster, giving us more time to deal with the growing demands,‚Äù she added.

Fundamental rights redefined,"The judgment also puts an end to some pernicious myths about the right to privacy. Illustration: C R Sasikumar The judgment also puts an end to some pernicious myths about the right to privacy. Illustration: C R Sasikumar

The right to privacy is not just a common law right, not just a legal right, not just a fundamental right under the Constitution. It is a natural right inherent in every individual. This, in sum, is the law laid down by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in K. Puttaswamy v Union of India. This finding of the Supreme Court has not come out of the blue. It is the inevitable conclusion of steady developments in the law in the last three decades where courts across the country, not just the apex court, have said that the right to privacy, to choose, to be free of unwanted intrusion and to determine what happens to their information, is a fundamental right under the Constitution. The judgment has consolidated the development of the law into a grand judgment of six concurring opinions that definitively lays down these principles.

The judgment is also part of the changing view of the Supreme Court on what are fundamental rights. From seeing them as distinct compartments against which to test laws (in A.K. Gopalan v State of Madras in 1950) to understanding them as a cumulative whole (Maneka Gandhi v Union of India) to now seeing them as boundaries which guarantee the dignity of a free individual in a modern republic, the courts have come a long way. Reading the right to privacy into each and every one of the fundamental rights in the Indian Constitution has meant that the scope and depth of these rights have been expanded. They have also taken the opportunity to definitely renounce the disgraceful majority judgment in ADM Jabalpur v S.S. Shukla, delivered at the height of the Emergency, which allowed the government to extinguish such rights at will.

The judgment also puts an end to some pernicious myths about the right to privacy. The six opinions delivered by the judges between them go to great lengths to point out that the right to privacy is not an elitist concern, not just a modern myth, or entirely irrelevant in the internet age. They have rejected any notion that the right to privacy is an impediment to social welfare in any way, and the idea that those who seek socio-economic security do not care about their civil and political rights.

Three elements are considered as the core to the right to privacy: Personal autonomy, the freedom to make choices and the right to determine what happens with information about oneself. The judges use slightly different terms for each but essentially stick to the well-known formulations that have been developed by scholars and courts around the world. These aspects, they find, are also reflected throughout Part III of the Constitution of India, which guarantees fundamental rights.

The consequence of this is also that the basis for state interference with privacy (by law or action) will have to meet the standards of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court over the years. The laws interfering with privacy will have to not only be just, fair and reasonable but also have to be based on the grounds enunciated in Part III. This expands the scope of judicial review of such laws and raises the burden on governments to ensure the constitutionality of laws.

The implications of this judgment go far above and beyond just the question of whether the Aadhaar scheme and law are valid. In this judgment itself, the SC has affirmed that sexual orientation is a part of the right to privacy (casting serious doubts over the fate of Section 377 of the IPC) and affirmed the right to choose one‚Äôs food habits (indirectly approving the Bombay High Court‚Äôs striking down parts of Maharashtra‚Äôs beef ban). The principles laid down here will go a long way in striking down some of the most regressive and tyrannical laws on the books.

Less clear, however, is this judgment‚Äôs impact on the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 and the larger scheme itself. The court consciously avoids trying to say anything specific about Aadhaar one way or another. It will be left to the subsequent benches which hear multiple challenges to Aadhaar to assess the circumstances and apply the principles suitably. The government will have to make clear to the court the objective with which it has sought to make Aadhaar mandatory in a given case, apart from defending the Aadhaar law itself.

What this judgment truly means will become clear in the days to come. If it is to mark a definitive turn in the understanding of fundamental rights, it will have to be applied uncompromisingly by the courts in the future. It would be a travesty if the bold assertions of the judges on privacy, rights, the state and constitutional values were to remain just words on paper, as courts avoid applying it for one reason or another. The burden of giving this landmark judgment full meaning rests with the judiciary itself as it is faced with laws that intrude into the lives of people. One hopes they rise to the challenge again.

"US President Donald Trump administration had to put pressure on India for Afghan role, says UN envoy Nikki Haley","US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. (File/Photo) US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. (File/Photo)

US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said on Tuesday that the Trump administration had to put pressure on India to step up its role in bringing about a political solution to end the prolonged war in Afghanistan. Her comments came as Trump today unveiled his new Afghan strategy retracting from his initial instinct to pull out from Afghanistan. Instead, the US president said, the American troops will ‚Äúfight to win‚Äù the 16-year-long conflict. In a prime-time address, Trump called out Pakistan for for providing safe havens to terrorists but also said that India was making ‚Äúbillions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to put the pressure on India that they have to be part of the political solution,‚Äù Haley told CNN.

The Indian-origin US ambassador to the UN said that Trump was taking a regional approach to end the Afghan conflict.

‚ÄúThis is not just about Afghanistan. This is about the region, and so that means that we‚Äôve got to put the pressure on Pakistan,‚Äù she said, adding that Pakistan can no longer harbour safe havens for terrorists.

‚ÄúWe need to continue to let Iran know that all of this terrorism and their sponsorship of it is not something we‚Äôre going to put up with. And we need the international community to step up and say, look, if we‚Äôre going to do this, we‚Äôre doing it together. It‚Äôs not the US alone,‚Äù Haley said.

She said America‚Äôs enemies were no longer going to know ‚Äúwhat the timeline is‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat our enemies are going to know is, we‚Äôre not putting up with the terrorism anymore and we‚Äôre going to do whatever it takes,‚Äù she told the network.

Senator Ben Cardin, a ranking member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, supported Trump‚Äôs Afghan policy.

‚ÄúI think the president, is calling on regional cooperation. That is the right thing. We need to have Pakistan as a more cooperative partner in dealing with Afghanistan. India could be an important partner in dealing with this,‚Äù he told on MSNBC News.

‚ÄúWhat I find difficult to follow is what he‚Äôs doing on the military side. It looks like he is dealing another surge with additional troops being put into Afghanistan,‚Äù he said.

Cardin said the US needed a diplomatic surge. ‚ÄúThat, to me, is going to be the key, whether he can implement a surge and have the confidence of our regional partners that we can really bring peace to Afghanistan,‚Äù the Democratic Senator said.

The Haryana health department has reserved 100 beds at the Panchkula civil hospital, officials said on Wednesday, two days ahead of the verdict in a rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmit Ram Rahim Singh. The health authorities said they have deputed additional staff and doctors in Panchkula civil hospital. The Haryana health department has already sent a communication to its counterparts in Chandigarh to remain alert.

VK Bansal, civil surgeon, Panchkula, told Chandigarh Newsline on Wednesday that 100 beds have been reserved at the hospital and 30 ambulances too have been stationed in Panchkula. ‚ÄúWe have made all the arrangements in Panchkula. We are geared up to tackle any situation. We have made a burn unit at the Emergency hall of the hospital. We have kept 40 stretchers and 20 wheelchairs reserved as well. The ambulance will be deployed as per the need,‚Äù said Bansal.

According to the health officials, specialists including orthopedics, will remain available round-the-clock at the hospital on Thursday and Friday to meet any situation. The Haryana health department has already asked its Chandigarh counterpart to keep 10 beds reserved at the Government Multi Specialty Hospital in Sector 16. The Chandigarh health department also has alerted all its hospitals in the city.

The Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32, Chandigarh, and Mohali health authorities too have said that in the wake of court verdict, the department has put all the medical staff on alert and they are prepared to tackle any situation.

Bansal also said the health department has also ordered cancellation of leaves of doctors in the wake of the verdict. The civil hospital on Tuesday had announced four nodal officers who will coordinate with different authorities from the hospitals.

Cologne cathedral walled off in post-Barcelona security rethink,"Spain‚Äôs King Felipe and other dignitaries leave after a solemn Mass at Barcelona‚Äôs Sagrada Familia Basilica for the victims of the terror attacks that killed 14 people and wounded over 120 in Barcelona , Spain, Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017.

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

German police placed concrete barriers in front of Cologne‚Äôs world famous gothic cathedral on Wednesday after reports that Islamist militants sought to target Barcelona‚Äôs La Sagrada Familia, another icon of ecclesiastical architecture. Many German cities have tightened security since last week‚Äôs van attack that killed 13 people in Barcelona, after a period in which most were wary of erecting barriers for fear of triggering a fortress mentality that would put off visitors.

‚ÄúWe took the decision to act as quickly as possible after looking at attacks in Europe,‚Äù a police spokeswoman said on Thursday. ‚ÄúOur job is to protect sensitive points, and the cathedral is a symbol of Cologne, known around the world.‚Äù Spanish media reported that the Islamist militant cell that sent a van ploughing into strollers on Barcelona‚Äôs showpiece Las Ramblas boulevard had been plotting an attack on Antoni Gaudi‚Äôs art nouveau landmark, the Sagrada Familia church. Cologne‚Äôs immense cathedral, the work of unidentified medieval masons, towers over the Rhine river city. A UNESCO World Heritage site, the cathedral was one of the few buildings in Cologne‚Äôs centre to survive World War Two bombings.

Although there have been around a dozen attacks around Europe by militants driving trucks, cities have not rushed to mitigate risks by changing their layout. They have been deterred by high costs, the belief that any measures now will soon be obsolete and a reluctance to disrupt everyday life. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to wall up the city,‚Äù Andreas Geisel, Berlin‚Äôs senator for interior affairs, said in an interview with Bild newspaper. ‚ÄúThat would achieve the opposite of what we want: to send out an image of calm and relaxedness.‚Äù

In the German capital, barriers remain in place around the site of a Christmas market where a militant drove a stolen truck into crowds and killed 12 people last year, but few other visible measures have been implemented.

Brice Leverdez: Journeyman who played match of his life,"Brice Leverdez is not part of the national team coached by Danish legend Peter Gade, and has stuck by his personal coach of his teenaged years.(Source: Reuters) Brice Leverdez is not part of the national team coached by Danish legend Peter Gade, and has stuck by his personal coach of his teenaged years.(Source: Reuters)

As ‚ÄòBoleh Boleh Lee Chong Wei‚Äô (Lee Chong Wei, You can) rose in crescendo, a group of French fans sitting alongside raised their clapper decibel. Brice Leverdez was playing the match of his life.

Badminton is next to nothing in France ‚Äì easily overshadowed by tennis. But Leverdez had picked it as a 12-year-old on holiday ‚Äì a few days after he didn‚Äôt know it even existed. He wasn‚Äôt too shabby at it and got picked for the regional centre and national team in quick time. By 18, Sydney Olympian Bertrand Gallet had decided to coach the bright kid though results took a dozen years to fetch up.

On Tuesday, when Leverdez beat Chong Wei in a thriller at the Emirates Arena, he had gone into the match sticking to a carefully discussed strategy. When the second game went into extra points after Chong Wei‚Äôs shot hit the line, the Frenchman‚Äôs coach following it online read the confused scoreline 21-19, 22-20 before the TV review reversed the line judge‚Äôs call, and messaged his congratulations. He would later send a follow-up: ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve won 21-15, 21-15, you as@#$%^‚Äù

Leverdez is not part of the national team coached by Danish legend Peter Gade, and has stuck by his personal coach of his teenaged years who‚Äôs not allowed to travel with the national team. ‚ÄúPeter doesn‚Äôt know me yet, but we‚Äôll figure out how to work in the future. I‚Äôm used to travelling alone. I‚Äôm old enough to travel alone,‚Äù he would say later.

Leverdez has been seeking the elusive calm needed to win matches all these years. ‚ÄúI want to go on court and enjoy, and I‚Äôve been looking for that state of mind where I‚Äôm relaxed for years,‚Äù he said.

The 31-year-old Frenchman had beaten Chong Wei in a freak result in Denmark last year. ‚ÄúI knew that he knows that I play well against him. Tactically, I knew what to do. It was kind of crazy match. If I think of it, I‚Äôd probably say I was lucky or something,‚Äù he‚Äôd chuckle.

At the end of Game 2, he knew he was up for a long match. ‚ÄúI knew when the shuttle fell that it was in, and I looked at the clock and said ‚ÄòDamn, 53 minutes‚Äô. The third game was won mostly mentally, because I felt my legs tire after the second.‚Äù

Rallying is not his style of play, and he‚Äôs honest about how lucky he was with some net shots, though he underplayed the pressure he exerted on the Malaysian legend, cheered on by a stadium that came alive sensing an upset, and the two sets of vocal fans.

Leverdez owns a clothing line ‚Äî ‚ÄúCurrently my badminton does better than my business!‚Äù ‚Äî and the Frenchman is keen to devote more time to the game after this win. ‚ÄúI need to give 40 per cent time to my business to earn money. I want to go further in the tournament, not just win first round,‚Äù he would add.

The Frenchman has no pretensions to being an exceptional player. ‚ÄúWhen you beat Chong Wei, you think you‚Äôve opened up the draw. But nothing opens up. Knowing me, I can lose to anyone, and win against anyone.‚Äù

Preferring the larger halls in Glasgow and London to the dimly lit cauldrons of Asia, Leverdez said it‚Äôs a practical preference. ‚ÄúI can see properly in bigger well-lit halls to make my attack pinpointed, precise.‚Äù

On Tuesday, he saw mighty well, and might just have ensured Lee Chong Wei calls it Lights Out.

Australia captain Mile Jedinak to miss key qualifier,"Australia captain Mile Jedinak was forced to miss the Confederations Cup. (Source: AP File) Australia captain Mile Jedinak was forced to miss the Confederations Cup. (Source: AP File)

Socceroos captain Mile Jedinak will miss the last two World Cup qualifiers against Japan and Thailand in a blow for Australia‚Äôs hopes of booking their tickets to the finals in Russia next year

The Aston Villa midfielder, who has been battling a groin injury since April, ruled himself out of contention for next Thursday‚Äôs crunch match in Japan and the home match against the Thais in Melbourne on Sept. 5

‚ÄúWe wanted to give him every chance. He was very keen to be a part of it but speaking to him last night, he‚Äôs probably not going to get in that game that he needs to see how he feels,‚Äù coach Ange Postecoglou said after naming the 23-man squad on Wednesday ‚ÄúObviously with it being a fairly long trip and with his long absence from gametime, probably he felt he wasn‚Äôt right and from that perspective, ruled himself out.

Even though Jedinak has been the rock at the heart of Australia‚Äôs midfield for the last few years, Postecoglou was confident he had enough options in his squad to fill the void .

At the Confederations Cup, which Jedinak also missed, Postecoglou mainly used experienced defensive midfielder Mark Milligan to provide cover for the more attack-minded Aaron Mooy and Massimo Luongo

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve kind of made sure we‚Äôve got a squad of players who can fill in when needed and we certainly have enough depth in that area to cover his absence,‚Äù Postecoglou said

Key central defender Trent Sainsbury was included despite not having played since picking up a groin injury in Australia‚Äôs final match at the Confederations Cup against Chile in June The coach named a seasoned playing group led by 100-cap forward Tim Cahill with winger Awer Mabil and goalkeeper Danny Vukovic the only players yet to represent their country

With the A-League currently in the off-season, Postecoglou was pleased that most of his 16 Europe-based players were playing regularly

‚ÄúMost of them are getting regular gametime and not just playing but playing well, which is important,‚Äù he added Australia are third in Group B of Asian qualifying, a point behind leaders Japan and level with second-placed Saudi Arabia with two rounds remaining The top two secure automatic berths to Russia, with the third-placed side needing to win two playoffs to advance

Squad-

Goalkeepers: Mitchell Langerak, Mathew Ryan, Daniel Vukovi

Defenders: Milos Degenek, Alex Gersbach, Ryan McGowan, Trent Sainsbury, Brad Smith, Matthew Spiranovic, Bailey Wright

Midfielders: Mustafa Amini, Jackson Irvine, Massimo Luongo, Mark Milligan, Aaron Mooy, Tom Rogic, James Trois

Arsenal handed Alexis Sanchez boost ahead of Liverpool trip,"Alexis Sanchez has attracted plenty of interest from rival clubs as he enters the final year of his contract. (Source: AP) Alexis Sanchez has attracted plenty of interest from rival clubs as he enters the final year of his contract. (Source: AP)

Arsenal‚Äôs Alexis Sanchez is fit to face Liverpool on Sunday and is focused on giving ‚Äúabsolutely everything‚Äù for the team despite uncertainty over the striker‚Äôs future at the club, manager Arsene Wenger has said.

The Chilean, Arsenal‚Äôs top scorer with 24 league goals last season, has attracted plenty of interest from rival clubs as he enters the final year of his contract and missed the first two Premier League games of the season with an abdominal strain.

‚ÄúSanchez has worked hard to be back and available again,‚Äù Wenger told a news conference on Thursday. ‚ÄúAlexis works very hard, he‚Äôs very focused and gives absolutely everything.

‚ÄúHe looks ready, he has not played for long time so I will have to decide what I do with him. (He could start) but we have to make that decision. We play on Sunday and he looks in good shape.‚Äù

French media have linked Sanchez with a move to Paris St Germain, while British media have reported that Manchester City are also interested in reuniting the 28-year-old with their manager Pep Guardiola, whom he played for at Barcelona.

Wenger said Sanchez had not been distracted by the transfer speculation and did not rule out the possibility of the Chilean committing to fresh terms.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs too much disturbed by all the noise, players at that level are used to it now,‚Äù the manager added. ‚ÄúHe is very focused, very happy and the fact he goes into the last year of his contract doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt extend it.‚Äù

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is another player with less than a year of his deal to run and Wenger said he wanted the 24-year-old to stay at the club.

‚ÄúI want Alex‚Ä¶ to be one of the big players for the future, one of the players the team can be built around,‚Äù Wenger added. ‚ÄúI want to keep my best players‚Ä¶. We‚Äôve invested time and money and confidence in players like Ox and they have a responsibility. I hope he commits.‚Äù

Centre back Laurent Koscielny is back from suspension for the trip to Anfield, where Arsenal have not won in the league since 2012. Wenger‚Äôs team suffered their first defeat of the season when they went down 1-0 at Stoke last Saturday, leaving Arsenal on three points from their opening two games.

Decoded: Why whisky tastes better with water,"Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky. (Source: Thinkstock Images) Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky. (Source: Thinkstock Images)

Adding a few drops of water enhances the taste of whisky, say scientists who confirm what alcohol connoisseurs have long known. Researchers at Linnaeus University in Sweden have found that adding water to whisky alters the drink‚Äôs molecules to make it taste better. Whisky is a chemically complicated beverage. After malting, mashing, fermentation, distillation and maturing, for at least three years in oak barrels, it is bottled.

However, first whisky is usually diluted to around 40 per cent of alcohol by volume by the addition of water, which changes the taste significantly. Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky. ‚ÄúThe taste of whisky is primarily linked to so-called amphipathic molecules, which are made up of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts,‚Äù said Bjorn Karlsson, chemistry researcher at Linnaeus University.

‚ÄúOne such molecule is guaiacol, a substance that develops when the grain is dried over peat smoke when making malt whisky, providing the smoky flavour to the whisky,‚Äù Karlsson said.

Researchers carried out computer simulations of water/ethanol mixtures in the presence of guaiacol to study its interactions. They found that guaiacol was preferentially associated with ethanol molecules and that in mixtures with concentrations of ethanol up to 45 per cent guaiacol was more likely to be present at the liquid-air interface than in the bulk of the liquid.

‚ÄúThis suggests that, in a glass of whisky, guaiacol will therefore be found near the surface of the liquid, where it contributes to both the smell and taste of the spirit,‚Äù said Ran Friedman, researcher in chemistry at Linnaeus University. ‚ÄúInterestingly, a continued dilution down to 27 per cent resulted in an increase of guaiacol at the liquid-air interface.

‚ÄúAn increased percentage, over 59 per cent, had the opposite effect, that is to say, the ethanol interacted more strongly with the guaiacol, driving the molecule into the solution away from the surface,‚Äù Friedman said. These findings suggest that the taste and aroma of guaiacol, and similar compounds in whisky, are enhanced when the spirit is diluted prior to bottling and this taste may be more pronounced on further dilution in the glass.

‚ÄúHow we experience taste and aroma is highly individual. Some people choose to add ice cubes to their whisky, to cool it down and give it a milder taste. Thus, there is no general answer to how much water you should add to your whisky to get the best taste experience,‚Äù Karlsson added. The research was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Pro Kabaddi 2017: Tamil Thalaivas hold UP Yoddha in thrilling tie,"UP Yoddha drew 33-33 agaisnt Tamil Thalaivas. (Source: PTI) UP Yoddha drew 33-33 agaisnt Tamil Thalaivas. (Source: PTI)

Coming in after four consecutive defeats, UP Yoddha managed to break their four-match losing streak with a 33-33 nail-biting finish in Lucknow. Rishank Devadiga‚Äôs 14 raid points powered UP Yoddha while Thalaivas captain Ajay Thakur completed his 11th super 10 as the two teams gave season 5 it‚Äôs sixth tie.

The home team had themselves to blame for squandering their first half lead as the visitors cashed in on another poor effort from the UP defenders to tie the match in the dying minutes.

Despite taking a 14-3 lead in first 10 minutes of first half, UP Yoddha gave away their hold on the match as the first half ended with Yoddha leading the match 19-11. Nitin Tomar & co have themselves to blame for squandering their lead as Thalaivas struggled against the hosts team in the first half. With UP playing an aggressive game, Tamil Thalaivas fought back with Ajay‚Äôs effective performance.

Tamil Thalaivas got their act together in the second half but it was Rishank Devadiga who made the difference for the hosts. He dominated the game right from the first whistle and didn‚Äôt let UP Yoddha sccumb in the dying moments. Rishank scored two points in the last three minutes to get his back into the game as Yoddhas took a lead of 33-31.

With less than three minutes to go, the Nitin-led side looked on course to register their first win at home. But Tamil surprised them with Vineet Kumar. The 27-year old made a successful raid in the dying seconds as the visitors levelled the score with a tackle point to tie the match.

Rajnath Singh to attend SCO meet on disaster in Kyrgyz Republic,"Rajnath Singh Rajnath Singh

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh will attend a two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on disaster prevention and relief at Choplon Ata in Kyrgyz Republic beginning on Thursday. ‚ÄúDuring the visit, the Home Minister is likely to have bilateral meetings with the ministers of some of the SCO member states,‚Äù an official statement said. Founded in 2001, the SCO member countries are China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan, and the bloc is headquartered in Beijing.

When asked whether Singh will meet his Chinese and Pakistani counterparts, a ministry spokesperson said as of now no meeting has been fixed. If Singh meets his Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of the SCO meeting, it will bear significance as both the countries have been engaged in a standoff in Doklam, near the Sikkim sector.

The participation of India as SCO member will open additional opportunities for giving new impetus to the development of international cooperation in the field of protecting the population and territories from emergency situations within the framework of the SCO and will bring it qualitatively new positions in regional and global formats, the statement said.

Poverty-level of Indian-origin people in S Africa decreases,"The poverty level of Indian-origin people in South Africa has consistently decreased over the past two decades from almost 21 per cent to under six per cent, according to official data released on Tuesday. The South African-Indian community, with about 1.4-million people, are not far behind from their white counterparts, who enjoyed special privileges in the apartheid era and have a poverty rate of just one per cent.

Coloured (mixed race) and the majority black Africans are lagging way behind with 41 and 61 per cent respectively, latest results from Statistics South Africa (SSA) show.

Statistician-General Pali Lehohla released the ‚ÄòPoverty Trends in South Africa‚Äô report which shows that despite the general decline in poverty between 2006 and 2011, overall poverty level in South Africa rose in 2015.

Black people continued to bear the brunt of poverty but that education remains the key to escaping poverty, Lehohla told reporters.

‚ÄúThree out of five blacks are poor. Poor whites are (almost) non-existent. Indians moved‚Ä¶ we could see this in the numbers when we talked about education. (Indians) caught up with whites in education, poverty dropped and education increased,‚Äù Lehola said.

‚ÄúUnlike the other population groups, the proportion of poor Indians consistently decreased between 2006 and 2015, reporting a decrease of 71.8 per cent.

‚ÄúIt is worthwhile to note that the decrease between 2011 and 2015 was less pronounced than the decrease experienced between 2006 and 2011. Nevertheless, Indians appear to have made strong gains in the war on poverty,‚Äù the report said.

Once subjected to restrictive apartheid laws, the first indentured labourers who arrived in the country from 1860 placed huge emphasis on education, pooling resources from their often meagre wages to build their own schools and send children to universities.

This practice, continued by future generations, resulted in poverty levels getting decreased over the past 167 years, with the 20.9 per cent poverty among the 1.4 million citizens of Indian-origin in 2006 having dropped to 5.9 per cent in the latest survey, the report added.

He is a circumspect communicator: Jairam Ramesh on Rahul Gandhi,
Repair and recover,"During PM Deuba‚Äôs visit, Delhi must convey the message: Ties with Nepal are more than transactional (Archive) During PM Deuba‚Äôs visit, Delhi must convey the message: Ties with Nepal are more than transactional (Archive)

The five-day visit by Nepal‚Äôs Prime Minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, is an opportunity for India to take a clear-eyed look at relations between the two countries. In Parliament on August 3, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj taunted the Congress for pointing out that ties with Nepal had deteriorated.

‚ÄúNot one visit to Nepal by an Indian Prime Minister in 17 years, 11 of which you were in power, and relations were great? And two visits by Prime Minister [Modi] in one year, and relations are bad?‚Äù she asked. The answer to the first question is no, and to the second, yes. Nepal-India relations have been uneven for decades, but the two Modi visits did not help repair them. India continues to be seen in Nepal as the interfering Big Brother, who ‚Äúmicromanages‚Äù the country‚Äôs politics and installs puppet governments.

If anything, anti-India sentiment was strengthened by the 2015 Great Blockade by the Madhesis ‚Äî it was seen to have Delhi‚Äôs tacit support ‚Äî in pursuit of their demand for greater representation in the Nepal Parliament. It was during the blockade that China poured money into Nepal for several infrastructure projects, and sewed up trade and transit deals. But the India-China stand-off in Doklam is forcing a rethink in India.

Madhesis, who have ethnic links with Indians in Bihar and UP, have realised with not a little disappointment, that India has shelved its support to their cause for a higher stakes game unfolding with China. By that same token, Nepal cannot be faulted for pressing home the advantage it has at this delicate time in India-China relations to see who can offer it the best deal.

Deuba is likely to bring up a long list of complaints against India, from the Mahakali Multipurpose Project he signed when he was PM in 1996 but which has not seen the light of day, to the ill-effects of the November 2016 demonetisation on Nepali traders and businessmen. At the political level, there are concerns, in Nepal‚Äôs opposition as well as within the ruling coalition, that the BJP government is pushing their government towards jettisoning the country‚Äôs recently acquired ‚Äúsecular‚Äù status.

New Delhi has drawn comfort that Deuba‚Äôs first foreign visit, after succeeding Pushpa Kamal Dahal as PM two months ago, is to the Indian capital. Many MoUs and other agreements will be signed to convey that India is a friend, even though without the deep pockets of China. The challenge will be to convince both Deuba and Nepal that India can really keep out of the country‚Äôs internal affairs, and that ties between the two countries are more than transactional.

‚ÄúIt was a good game today. There were some intense rallies and I am happy for the win,‚Äù Srikanth told PTI. ‚ÄúIt will be a tough match but I have been improving with each match and looking forward for a good game tomorrow,‚Äù Srikanth added.

Srikanth and Wan Ho are tied 4-4 in their head-to-head record with the Indian‚Äôs recent victories coming in Indonesia and Singapore.

Movies have, time and again, glamourised sexual assault on the big screen, and sneaked away‚Ä¶ Well, it‚Äôs no laughing matter, is it? From showing two wild flowers in a garden to selling bold love-making scenes, there has been quite a huge switch in the portrayal of love scenes over the years. However, the lead actor, somehow, has always gotten away with stalking, harassing and eve-teasing the lead actress, and is still deemed as the ‚Äòhero‚Äô in the end. When will this obnoxious formula die a natural death?

Shedding light on the prominent issue at hand, Pulkit Arora shared a screenshot from the trailer of Judwaa 2 starring Varun Dhawan, Taapsee Pannu and Jacqueline Fernandez. In the scene, Dhawan can be seen forcibly kissing Pannu, and it is made to look like horseplay. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre supposed to like this character for committing sexual assault. What a badmaash, so cute,‚Äù Arora wrote in his post, spilling the thoughts of many viewers in a thought-provoking post.

Read his original post here:

‚ÄúProfessional Salman Khan impersonator Varun Dhawan opens the #Judwaa2 trailer with a playful recounting of how he forced his mouth on a woman as she struggled to push him away.

We‚Äôre supposed to like this character for committing sexual assault. What a badmaash, so cute.

I‚Äôve seen classes and classes of children be conditioned to objectify their female teachers after watching Salman Khan films over the weekend. No one in their right mind can deny the impact films have on what we consider right or wrong as a culture.

At what point do we hold filmmakers accountable? In a country where crimes against women are rampant, how is this not even being discussed? HOW HARD IS IT TO NOT PLAY PEPPY MUSIC AS SEXUAL ASSAULT HAPPENS ONSCREEN?‚Äù

Check out the post on Facebook here.

The hard-hitting post grabbed a lot of eyeballs, and influential people went on to share it on their respective accounts too. From comedian Biswa Kalyan Rath to the official handles of well-known film festivals, it has been re-posted several times, collecting more than 700 shares so far.

"Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: This Rajkummar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana and Kriti Sanon film works in fits and starts","Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast. Bareilly Ki Barfi movie review: Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast.

Bareilly Ki Barfi star cast: Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon, Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi, Seema Tripathi

Bareilly Ki Barfi director: Ashwini Iyer Tiwari

Bareilly Ki Barfi rating: 2.5 stars

‚ÄòBareilly ke bazaar mein barfi giri re‚Äô. Clearly, the film was made keeping the iconic song in mind, except with an alliterative ‚Äòbarfi‚Äô not a ‚Äòjhumka‚Äô in mind.

This Small-Town Rom Com ticks all the boxes going in: perky girl armed with requisite quirky parents, a couple of suitable boys, and great one liners. And it does work in fits and starts, but it flattens equally in between. The thing with dreaming up smart lines, and there are some quite wonderfully flavoursome ones in here, is that sometimes entire scenes get written just to be able to include the punch-lines: this ‚Äòmithai‚Äô has several such sequences, and make the run-time flabby.

One fine day, Bitti Mishra (Sanon) pronounced, quite properly Misra, by the ‚Äòh‚Äô dropping Bareilly-walas, sets her heart on meeting a mysterious someone who seems to know her inside out. Local printing press owner Chirag (Khurrana) is smitten. And then arrives a guy who goes by the name of Pritam Vidrohi (Rao) who is the fly in the ointment. Or is he? Will the new entrant surge ahead? Who will win the fair maiden?

Among the good things about this film is the superb supporting cast: Tripathi, who‚Äôs much too young to play the leading lady‚Äôs father, does a good job of being Bitti‚Äôs papa, who‚Äôs more like a pal than a pa. Pahwa scores another ace after Aankhon Dekhi: what a lovely actress she is.

The two actors who play the best friends, one who accompanies Khurrana, and the other who is seen with Sanon, are pitch perfect. They show up the problems that Sanon has with merging into her part: she tries hard to the be the small-town girl who likes a couple of puffs on the side, and who break dances for fun, but the effort shows.

The plot‚Äôs contrivances come in the way of Khurrana‚Äôs playing of Chirag fully credibly. As does Rajkummar Rao, who blows away the weaknesses of this film with his consummate act, playing the timid ‚Äòchota shehari‚Äô on the one hand, and the loud ‚Äòrangbaaz‚Äô on the other.

Rao sweetens the pot, and makes up for the rest of it. Almost.

"In chaotic meeting, Charlottesville votes to shroud statues","Police struggle with a protester during unrest at a demonstration against a statue of a Confederate soldier nicknamed Silent Sam on the campus of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, U.S. August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Drake Police struggle with a protester during unrest at a demonstration against a statue of a Confederate soldier nicknamed Silent Sam on the campus of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, U.S. August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Drake

The Charlottesville City Council voted to drape two Confederate statues in black fabric during a chaotic meeting packed with irate residents who screamed and cursed at councilors over the city‚Äôs response to a white nationalist rally.

The anger at Monday night‚Äôs meeting, during which three people were arrested, forced the council to abandon its agenda and focus instead on the tragedy. Covering the statues is intended to signal the city‚Äôs mourning for Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer, who was killed when a car slammed into a crowd protesting the rally.

‚ÄúI think what you saw last night was a traumatized community beginning the process of catharsis,‚Äù Mayor Mike Signer told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

The council meeting was the first since the ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù event, which was believed to be the largest gathering of white nationalists in a decade. The demonstrators arrived in Charlottesville partly to protest the city council‚Äôs vote to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

That removal is in the midst of a legal challenge. A state law passed in 1998 forbids local governments from removing, damaging or defacing war monuments, but there is legal ambiguity about whether that applies to statues such as the Lee monument, which was erected before the law was passed. A judge has issued an injunction preventing the city from removing the Lee statue while the lawsuit plays out.

Signer said Tuesday that city staff had begun working to find a way to cover the large statues with a material that can withstand the elements. The council believes doing so would not violate the state law, he said.

At the meeting, many speakers directed their anger at Signer. They expressed frustration that city leaders had granted a permit for the rally and criticized police for allowing the two sides to clash violently before the rally even started. That fighting went on largely uninterrupted by authorities, until the event was declared an unlawful assembly and the crowd was forced to disperse.

‚ÄúWhy did you think that you could walk in here and do business as usual after what happened on the 12th?‚Äù City Council candidate and community activist Nikuyah Walker said.

The mayor tried to restore order, but as tensions escalated, the meeting was temporarily suspended. Video showed protesters chanting ‚Äúblood on your hands‚Äù as Signer stood at the front of the room. Others held signs calling for his resignation.

When the meeting resumed, the agenda was scuttled and the council listened to input from residents.

Three people were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct or obstruction, police said.

The council also voted to take the procedural first steps toward removing a statue of Confederate Gen. Thomas ‚ÄúStonewall‚Äù Jackson. City leaders had initially planned to leave it in place.

‚ÄúI believe that the removal of the Confederate statues is a necessary part of showing that this community can be truly a community of mutual respect,‚Äù Councilwoman Kristin Szakos, who proposed covering the statues, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe must do that if we hope to move forward to true justice and equity. We should have done it years ago.‚Äù

A woman who told the council her daughter was hurt in the car collision also asked why the number of injured had been widely reported as 19 when she believed it was higher.

The University of Virginia Medical Center said it treated 19 patients _ a number the city repeated in a news release. On Tuesday, a spokesman for Sentara Martha Jefferson hospital said it treated 15 patients from the rally over the weekend. Eleven were directly related to the car incident, and one was transferred to UVA, he said.

Later Tuesday, University of Virginia police disclosed they had obtained arrest warrants for a white nationalist in connection with crimes they say were committed on campus a day before a rally that ended in deadly violence.

Police said in a statement Tuesday that Christopher Cantwell of Keene, New Hampshire, was being sought on three felony charges: two counts of the illegal use of tear gas or other gases and one count of malicious bodily injury with a ‚Äúcaustic substance,‚Äù explosive or fire.

The statement said the warrants stem from incidents on campus the evening of Aug. 11, when hundreds of white nationalists marched across the grounds, chanting anti-Semitic slogans and carrying torches. At one point, the marchers were confronted by a much smaller group of counter-protesters. But police didn‚Äôt elaborate on the allegations against Cantwell.

On Tuesday night, the Norfolk City Council approved a resolution declaring its desire to move an 80-foot Confederate monument from its downtown to a cemetery as soon as state law allows it. The measure asks Virginia‚Äôs attorney general to clarify what state law permits.

‚ÄòToday‚Äôs Right to Privacy judgment will have a tremendous impact on Section 377‚Äô,"Image for representational purpose. Express photo by Partha Paul. Image for representational purpose. Express photo by Partha Paul.

The Supreme Court judgment today is a fantastic one and it clearly has very far-reaching implications on a number of issues. Increasingly, many of us had been feeling trapped by what is happening with Aadhaar card; and the obvious other big piece for me is Section 377. The Supreme Court‚Äôs decision that right to privacy is a wholly qualified fundamental right has huge implications. Suppose the it hadn‚Äôt been granted, then it would have meant that the government or anyone or any agency for that matter could get to you in the privacy of your own home. If you recall the case of Professor Siras at Aligarh Muslim University, local journalists had barged into his bedroom and filmed him. That kind of a violation cannot happen now.

Right to privacy had been an integral part of the Delhi High Court judgment on section 377 in 2009. In spite of that judgment being such a wonderful one, it had still been set aside by the Supreme Court in 2013. Luckily, the apex court is willing to listen to the curative petition. I am sure that today‚Äôs judgment will have a tremendous impact on that.

If you look at the Delhi High Court judgment, the Naz Foundation had basically asked for a reading down of the law, so that consenting adults are not within its purview. We asked for the reading down because child sexual abuse was prosecuted under this law. But now with POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act having come into existence, 377 is not an issue except for the part which covers sexual violence against animals.

What people need to understand is that the Delhi High Court judgment had been a decriminalisation of homosexuality for consenting adults. It was not like any great rights were granted to the LGBT community. Even after homosexuality is decriminalised, they do not automatically get the rights that all other citizens take for granted like the right to marriage, right to inherit, right to adopt etc. But decriminalisation is the first, necessary step and right to privacy would have a huge role in that. I feel proud that our courts have given such a judgment today.

No immersion on Oct 1 to avoid clash with Muharram: Mamata Banerjee,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced on Wednesday that no Durga idols will be immersed on October 1 to prevent Puja festivities from clashing with Muharram processions. Hours later, the state BJP said it will move court against her decision. Speaking to puja organisers in Kolkata, Mamata said, ‚ÄúThere will be no immersions on October 1 due to Muharram. However, immersions will resume on October 2 and continue till October 4 ‚Äî the day before Lakshmi Puja.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis year Durga Puja and Muharram have fallen at the same time. We have to maintain peace during the festivals. I will ask the police to talk to puja and Muharram committees. Barricades will be set up at places where Muharram processions will be taken out so that processions of both communities do not mix up. The puja committees will have to play a vital role in this regard. You have to ensure that no untoward incident takes place. We will not allow anyone to incite riots,‚Äù she added.

Lashing out at Mamata, BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha told The Indian Express, ‚ÄúLast year, she had given similar orders which were challenged in the high court, which had pulled up the state government for giving such arbitrary orders aimed at appeasing the minorities. However, the high court order had come after the festival. We will challenge her decision in the court of law.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Mamata Banerjee government is appeasing the minorities by putting restrictions on Hindu celebrations. Hindus here cannot take out Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti processions. Now she has put a restriction on idol immersion. We oppose such a decision,‚Äù he said.

Last year, Mamata had angered many by imposing similar restrictions, despite which incidents of communal violence had been reported from the state. In North 24 Parganas, clashes between Hindus and Muslims left several injured, and homes and shops gutted. The trigger for the violence was a low-intensity bomb attack on a Muharram procession.

Leicester City‚Äôs Harry Maguire doubtful for Manchester United clash,"Leicester City‚Äôs Harry Maguire. (Source: AP) Leicester City‚Äôs Harry Maguire. (Source: AP)

Leicester City‚Äôs Harry Maguire is a doubt for Saturday‚Äôs Premier League trip to early pace-setters Manchester United after manager Craig Shakespeare said on Thursday that the centre back had missed part of training due to a knee injury.

Maguire, who was named in England‚Äôs squad for next month‚Äôs World Cup qualifiers on Thursday, was injured in Leicester‚Äôs 4-1 League Cup win over Sheffield United in midweek, a game his partner in defence Wes Morgan missed with a back injury.

Shakespeare said Morgan was fit for the United match, but with fellow defender Robert Huth still recovering after ankle surgery, is hoping new signing Maguire does not face a prolonged spell out.

‚ÄúHarry hasn‚Äôt trained fully today as a precaution,‚Äù the manager told a news conference. ‚ÄúI am hoping there is nothing long term there. It was because of the tackle‚Ä¶ and he has had an adverse reaction to it 24 hours later.

‚ÄúWe are taking it easy with Robert, he is sore in the foot and we have to be mindful.‚Äù

Morgan‚Äôs absence led Shakespeare to field left back Christian Fuchs in central defence in the cup tie, but the manager said his club captain would be ‚Äúfighting fit‚Äù for the United game.

‚ÄúWes will be involved,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúHe has trained the last couple of days. Hopefully we won‚Äôt get an adverse reaction tomorrow but he has trained fully today.‚Äù

United have made a strong start to the season, taking maximum points from their first two games and scoring eight goals without conceding, while Leicester began with a 4-3 defeat by Arsenal before downing Brighton and Hove Albion 2-0.

With new signings Vicente Iborra (groin) and Kelechi Iheanacho (toe) struggling for fitness, Shakespeare said he was looking forward to the international break after the trip to Old Trafford, where Leicester have not won in the league since 1998.

‚ÄúOnce we get over United we have a couple of weeks and I am hoping we can up (Iborra‚Äôs) fitness and get him out onto the grass. He hasn‚Äôt joined in with the squad yet,‚Äù the manager said.

Vegan diet may help lower your cholesterol,"Plant-based eating patterns leads to changes in body composition which help in reducing the cholesterol levels (Source: File Photo) Plant-based eating patterns leads to changes in body composition which help in reducing the cholesterol levels (Source: File Photo)

Are you suffering from high cholesterol? Try plant-based vegetarian diets, especially vegan diets, which can significantly help lower the levels of cholesterol ‚Äî known to increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to a study.

The findings showed that long-term adherence to plant-based eating patterns leads to changes in body composition which help in reducing the cholesterol levels. The reductions were found to be greater compared to omnivorous diets.

The immediate health benefits of a plant-based diet like weight loss, lower blood pressure and improved cholesterol are well known.

However, ‚Äúour goal is to capture the net risk reduction of using a vegetarian diet to control lipid levels. We hope to empower patients with new research about the long-term cardiovascular health benefits of a vegetarian diet, which include a reduced risk of a heart attack, stroke and premature death,‚Äù said Susan Levin from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington.

Cholesterol is a fatty substance known as a lipid and is vital for the normal functioning of the body.While high levels of ‚Äúgood‚Äù HDL cholesterol are beneficial, too much ‚Äúbad‚Äù LDL cholesterol can lead to heart disease.

Plant-based diet includes vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and whole grains, which are naturally rich in components such as soluble fiber, soy protein and plant sterols, while an omnivorous diet includes both plant and animal foods.

For the study, appearing in the journal Nutrition Reviews, the team conducted a dietary review of 49 observational and controlled studies.

The results revealed that a plant-based vegetarian diet is associated with total cholesterol that‚Äôs 29.2 mg/dL lower. Further, in clinical trials, a plant-based diet lowered total cholesterol by 12.5 mg/dL.

Venezuela‚Äôs ousted prosecutor accuses Nicolas Maduro of corruption,"Venezuela‚Äôs former chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz (Source: Reuters/file) Venezuela‚Äôs former chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz (Source: Reuters/file)

Venezuela‚Äôs recently ousted chief prosecutor accused President Nicolas Maduro and several allies on Wednesday of participating in acts of corruption, saying she would turn over proof that would help other countries prosecute. Venezuela‚Äôs government quickly fired back, accusing Luisa Ortega Diaz of ‚Äúgrave moral and ethical infractions.‚Äù

Ortega spoke during a meeting of Mercosur trade bloc prosecutors in the Brazilian capital, Brasilia. Ortega was removed by a new, pro-government constitutional assembly in early August after breaking with Venezuela‚Äôs socialist government. She fled abroad with her husband, whose arrest was ordered by the country‚Äôs supreme court.

‚ÄúI want to denounce, in front of the world, a grave situation in Venezuela: that of excessive corruption,‚Äù Ortega said. ‚ÄúBecause of that reason, (Maduro‚Äôs administration) is violating the constitution and law to protect itself.‚Äù Ortega said she had evidence implicating Maduro and other top officials in corruption involving Brazilian constructor Odebrecht and other companies.

Ortega told reporters after the meeting that Maduro loyalist Diosdado Cabello received $100 million from Odebrecht via a Spanish company called TSE Arietis, which was owned by cousins of Cabello. She also claimed that Maduro was the owner of a Mexican company that Venezuela had contracted to provide basic foodstuffs. She said Group Grand Limited was registered in Mexico under the names Rodolfo Reyes, Alvaro Pulido Vargas and Alex Saab, but that Maduro was the real owner.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible for cases to be investigated in Venezuela,‚Äù said Ortega, adding that she was providing documentation to the United States, Brazil, Colombia and Spain. Ortega‚Äôs claims could not be immediately verified. Emails sent to Group Grand Limited and TSE Arietis seeking comment were not returned.

In a statement, Odebrecht said the allegations made by Ortega were ‚Äúnot true.‚Äù In particular, the company denied Ortega‚Äôs allegation that Odebrecht had received money for projects that had been halted. ‚ÄúCurrently 11 projects are underway (in Venezuela), and not one has been abandoned despite an economic crisis that has reduced investments in infrastructure across Latin America,‚Äù said the statement.

Odebrecht has been at the center of the massive ‚ÄúCar Wash‚Äù probe in Brazil involving kickbacks for contracts. Over the last three years, dozens of Brazil‚Äôs top politicians and businessmen have been jailed, including former Odebrecht CEO Marcelo Odebrecht.

The investigation has led to prosecutions in several countries in Latin America where Odebrecht and other Brazilian construction companies operated. Hours later Ortega‚Äôs replacement, Tarek William Saab, told reporters in Venezuela‚Äôs capital that the accusations ‚Äúlacked validity‚Äù and should presented to Venezuelan authorities. Saab called Ortega a ‚Äúworld tourist‚Äù who had been pushed out because of her own infractions.

Even if Ortega possesses strong evidence, however, it‚Äôs not clear whether it could hurt Maduro‚Äôs administration, which is already alienated from many of the region‚Äôs countries. While Brazil shares information with other countries related to the ‚ÄúCar Wash‚Äù investigation, authorities say they leave the prosecution of foreign nationals to justice officials in those countries.

Ortega‚Äôs visit to Brazil, Latin America‚Äôs most populous nation and largest economy, came a day after Maduro claimed that she was working with Washington to damage his administration and said Venezuela would ask for an international arrest warrant for Ortega. It wasn‚Äôt immediately known if that had been requested or if it would be considered. Mercosur has suspended Venezuela due to the crisis there.

Brazil‚Äôs foreign minister, Aloysio Nunes, told Globo News that Ortega would be ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù granted asylum if she asked for it. Ortega has not signaled that she would.

"France‚Äôs Emmanuel Macron, seeking to re-shape Europe, heads towards eastern region","Although posted workers make up less than 1 percent of the EU workforce, with many employed in the haulage and construction sectors, the issue has deepened a divide between the poor east and rich west. (File Photo) Although posted workers make up less than 1 percent of the EU workforce, with many employed in the haulage and construction sectors, the issue has deepened a divide between the poor east and rich west. (File Photo)

While Britain toils over its messy divorce with the European Union, France‚Äôs president Emmanuel Macron is embarking on a drive to deepen the economic integration of a bloc he says needs to be more protective of its citizens. The French leader this week embarks on a three-day tour of central and eastern Europe, where he will seek to win backers for his push to tighten labour rules over ‚Äòposted‚Äô workers, a sensitive issue that has exacerbated an east-west rift. Days later, euro zone reforms, defence cooperation and immigration will be in focus when Macron hosts the leaders of Germany, Spain and Italy for talks, as he seeks to enhance France‚Äôs leadership in Europe.

Paris has long complained that central and eastern Europe gains an unfair advantage from the ‚Äúsocial dumping‚Äù of cheap labour, arguing the posting of low-paid workers hurts local jobs and erodes labour protections in higher-wage member states.

Although posted workers make up less than 1 percent of the EU workforce, with many employed in the haulage and construction sectors, the issue has deepened a divide between the poor east and rich west.

Macron will visit Romania, Bulgaria and Austria, where he will also meet the leaders of Czech Republic and Slovakia, but is skipping Hungary and Poland, whose right-wing governments he has accused of spurning the bloc‚Äôs values. An Elysee Palace source said Macron was visiting countries who were ‚Äúthe most attached to their European anchoring‚Äù.

The source dismissed suggestions that Macron is seeking to drive a wedge between central and eastern European countries staunchly opposed to reform and those that see scope for compromise. ‚ÄúThis is not about dividing in order to better rule,‚Äù the source said in a briefing to reporters earlier this month.

DIVISIONS

Macron‚Äôs election win has re-energised the EU‚Äôs Franco-German axis but in Poland and Hungary it has fanned fears of a ‚Äúmulti-speed‚Äù Europe that could mean reduced influence, financial support and economic competitiveness.

The 39-year-old leader will find a sympathetic ear in Austria, which borders four eastern European countries and where the ruling Social Democrats say an influx of workers from the east is weighing on wages. The posted workers directive permits European companies to send employees to other EU states on contracts under which they only have to guarantee the minimum wage of the host country.

Macron has said a European Commission proposal that posted workers‚Äô pay packets should include benefits in line with host country regulations and that their contracts be limited to two years does not go far enough. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic ‚Äî known together as the Visegrad four ‚Äî say the proposals go too far. They argue they should be allowed to compete on lower prices to catch up after decades of communist stagnation.

Estonia, which holds, the EU‚Äôs rotating presidency, is due to table a new proposal in September. Poland has accused Macron of double standards by advocating a closer Europe while seeking to erode competition in the single market. Two sources in the Polish government said it had tried to invite Macron to Warsaw as part of his trip.

‚ÄúBut we didn‚Äôt see much willingness,‚Äù said one of the sources. Poland‚Äôs Deputy Infrastructure Minister Justyna Skrzydlo told Reuters the Warsaw government trusted in the ‚Äúcontinued unity and solidarity of the Central Europe countries‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe believe that Central European states highlight competitiveness in the European economy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are utterly confident that it will endure in the future.‚Äù Other countries have shown signs of being open to compromise and aligning themselves with an eventual new EU proposal.

‚ÄúI am very much interested in regional cooperation within the Visegrad four, but Slovakia‚Äôs vital interest is the EU,‚Äù Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico. Beyond the issue of posted workers, Macron is likely to be on a charm offensive to drum up support for proposed wider reforms to the European Union that include deeper defence cooperation, fiscal harmonisation and a common budget for the euro zone. His advisors say French diplomacy has long neglected central Europe.

‚ÄúHe wants to get started on Europe. The sooner he starts building these relationships, the more political capital he will accumulate to use at a later stage,‚Äù said Teneo Intelligence analyst Antonio Barroso

Sidharth Malhotra on Jacqueline Fernandez‚Äôs pole dance: There were a lot of thoughts. I was longing for more,"A Gentleman: Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez are paired opposite each other for the first time. A Gentleman: Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez are paired opposite each other for the first time.

The moment Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez walk in the room, you forget that they are here to talk about their upcoming film A Gentleman. Their level of comfort, giggles and chemistry is endearing and not something we‚Äôve seen them share with any of their previous co-stars. These two were last seen in Brothers, where Jackie played the wife of Sid‚Äôs brother Akshay Kumar. So how did the tables turn? How did they end up sharing such a crackling chemistry? The actors were at their humorous best while speaking to indianexpress.com in capital New Delhi. Sidharth playfully brought Akshay‚Äôs latest hit Toilet: Ek Prem Katha in his reply, ‚ÄúActually, Akshay sir went to the toilet, and this is what happened. It‚Äôs good to use toilet. I was like the true gentleman, waiting for the right opportunity.‚Äù Jacqueline quipped, ‚ÄúYou know, he was a very very bad brother‚Ä¶‚Äù

Directed by Raj and DK, A Gentleman has already grabbed attention for its catchy tagline ‚Äì Sundar, Susheel, Risky. ‚ÄúJacqueline is the hot and sundar. I come in the susheel part. And I think our directors are very risky. First of all, we are all a true ‚ÄòA Gentleman‚Äô and then we have these three aspects to the film as well,‚Äù Sidharth explained.

Sidharth Malhotra plays the double roles of Gaurav and Rishi in A Gentleman. Sidharth Malhotra plays the double roles of Gaurav and Rishi in A Gentleman.

Sid will be seen in a double role for the first time ‚Äì Gaurav, who is content with his 9 to 5 job, and Rishi, who lives life on the edge. So, will he like to be Gaurav in real life too? ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be. I would get bored of all the routine and mundanes. I‚Äôm pretty lucky and blessed to have a career in acting, where nothing is permanent. So, I found a lot of humour that came out of Gaurav‚Äôs life. He has bought a big house and wants to start a family. I‚Äôm yet to do all those things,‚Äù he said.

Jacqueline‚Äôs character Kavya wants Gaurav to get risky. So, will she want her man in real life to get risky too? ‚ÄúI do want Gaurav to be more adventurous in the film. I just feel that even in life, it‚Äôs risks which pay off. You have just one shot. So, you have to go with adventure, you have to live your life to the fullest, at the same time, have the balance of Gaurav.‚Äù And while Jackie tried to get philosophical, Sid barged in to add zing to it. ‚ÄúShe basically wants two-three boys. She wants so many qualities. She is very demanding,‚Äù and the two break into giggles.

Jacqueline Fernandez underwent training to learn pole dancing for song ‚ÄúChandralekha‚Äù. Jacqueline Fernandez underwent training to learn pole dancing for song ‚ÄúChandralekha‚Äù.

The film not only has some sizzling romance and high-octane action, but Jacqueline‚Äôs sensuous pole dance in the song ‚ÄúChandralekha‚Äù seems to be the flavour of the season. However, speaking on reports that her pole dance scenes have been shortened to avoid trouble with the Censor Board, Jackie said, ‚ÄúWe have been very lucky. We haven‚Äôt had much of these cuts in our film. I think we aren‚Äôt depicting anything erotic and it was fun.‚Äù Sid added, ‚ÄúIt is a huge sport in America. It is used for fitness and hobby. Her pole dancing is also more of a sport in terms of being anything provocative or erotic. So, I think when they saw the film, they also realised there was no such objection to it.‚Äù

Sidharth couldn‚Äôt gush any less, when we asked his first thoughts when he saw Jacqueline doing the pole dance on the sets. ‚ÄúThere were a lot of thoughts and visuals. I kept saying, one more shot, one more shot. My first reaction was longing for more,‚Äù he said with a wink.

The 32-year-old actor had previously told indianexpress.com, that A Gentleman is a ‚Äòpopcorn action‚Äô, and he maintains his stance. ‚ÄúYes, it is still the ‚Äòpopcorn action‚Äô film. It‚Äôs a stress-free watch, you can come with your families. It has action, comedy, good locations, dancing, two versions of me. You might haven‚Äôt watched a film from such genre for a lot time where you have this kind of gloss and glamour and then get entertained too,‚Äù he assured.

So why was the film called ‚ÄòA Gentleman‚Äô and not ‚ÄòA Gentlewoman‚Äô? Jacqueline said, ‚ÄúWell, that actually can be part two.‚Äù Sid jumped to tell us the film‚Äôs full name, ‚ÄúLara Croft A Gentlewoman: Sundar, only sundar and sexy, hot‚Ä¶‚Äù We left the two giggling about their personal jokes, making us wonder more about their real-life chemistry.

"Setback for Lalu Yadav, Mayawati says BSP will not attend BJP Bhagao rally in Patna","BSP chief Mayawati (PTI Photo) BSP chief Mayawati (PTI Photo)

In a big setback for RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, BSP chief Mayawati on Thursday said her party will not participate in the RJD‚Äôs BJP Bhagao Rally in Patna August 27, news agency ANI reported. Clarifying her decision to skip the rally, Mayawati said, ‚ÄúBSP has clearly told the RJD that it will share the dais with any regional or national party only when it is decided beforehand on how many seats will go to which party in the secular alliance‚Ä¶Before finalising any secular programme the policy and principle of seat sharing should be decided (first) as the life of an alliance is dependent on it and all should get respectable number of seats.‚Äù

Earlier on Wednesday, Lalu Yadav had told media that BSP leader Satish Mishra will attend the rally. ‚ÄúI had a talk with Mayawati. She said senior BSP leader Satish Mishra would come for the rally,‚Äù he had told reporters. The latest decision by Mayawati can be a big disappointment for Lalu Yadav as Congress chief Sonia Gandhi too has decided to give the rally a miss. According to the RJD chief, senior Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and C P Joshi would also attend the rally with a message from All India Congress Committee (AICC) president Sonia Gandhi.

‚ÄúIf the issue of seat sharing is decided beforehand, it will save the mutual distrust at the last minute as also the trust of the people will be kept intact‚Ä¶then it will not be difficult to defeat the BJP,‚Äù she said. The BSP president said that her party has always supported unity among secular parties and has also taken steps against ‚Äúthe BJP and company and RSS and their communal and casteist mentality‚Äù.

‚ÄúAs far as the issue of taking part in the Patna rally is concerned, BSP‚Äôs concern is that there should be no distrust among the people and there is no tiff between the secular parties on the issue of seat sharing even if this rally turns out to be a success‚Ä¶there are cases of back stabbing in the past and it must be ensure that eventually the BJP does not gain from it,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúBSP is not against the joint struggle or alliance between secular parties but all this need to be carried out with good intentions and full honesty‚Ä¶the experience of last Assembly election in Bihar proved how some parties had parted ways at the last time over seat sharing,‚Äù she said.

The former chief minister said that BSP never compromises on self respect, and enters into an understanding only when it feels that it is getting respectable number of seats. ‚ÄúPresently BJP and company is in government in the state and at the Centre and will use all tactics to defame secular opposition parties or weaken them also by misusing government machinery‚Ä¶the EC is also wary of their anti-democratic stance to win elections,‚Äù Mayawati said.

Under such circumstances, she said, opposition parties need to chalk out concrete strategy to defeat BJP so that the confidence of the people can be won over again and for this seat adjustment is the most important thing failing which alliances are disintegrated at election time.

‚Äú‚Ä¶this also breaks peoples trust and give a wrong message to people and only result in BJP making electoral gains,‚Äù she said.

Keeping these facts in mind, BSP is very alert and think seriously and many times on the issue of sharing dais with any secular party as a result of which there will not be any participation of BSP in the Patna rally, she said.

At the time of announcing the ‚ÄòBJP Bhagao Rally‚Äô (oust BJP rally) at the Gandhi Maidan at Patna, Lalu Yadav had boasted of bringing Mayawati and Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav together on one platform, which would mean the ‚Äúend of the match for the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls‚Äù.

"Was part of Hurriyat plan to mediate on Kargil war, says businessman in NIA net","Zahoor Watali Zahoor Watali

A Kashmiri businessman, who is being questioned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) over his alleged role in organising funds for militants and separatists in the Valley, has told investigators that he was part of an effort by the Hurriyat to act as mediator between India and Pakistan during the Kargil war. The offer, made during the peak of the conflict in 1999, was rejected by Pakistan, he claimed.

The businessman, Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, claimed during questioning that he was closely associated with the slain separatist leader Abdul Gani Lone, on whose behalf he carried a letter addressed to then prime minister Nawaz Sharif and containing the mediation offer to Pakistan. Watali claimed that the offer was an effort by the Hurriyat to ‚Äúlegitimise itself‚Äù.

Official sources told The Indian Express that Watali also claimed that he played an instrumental role in ensuring the presence of Nawaz Sharif in New Delhi for the swearing-in ceremony in May 2014 of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The businessman claimed that he had once accompanied Abdul Gani Lone during a visit for treatment to the US, where the Kashmiri leader allegedly met former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto and another senior functionary from Islamabad. During that meeting, he told investigators, Lone allegedly told Bhutto that his first choice would be an independent Kashmir but if left with no options, would prefer to go with India. Read | From the Valley, in the NIA and ED net

Abdul Gani Lone was shot dead by unidentified gunmen during a rally in Srinagar in May 2002. His son Sajjad Lone is a minister in the J&K government. According to Watali, sources said, he also met Sardar Muhammad Abdul Qayyum Khan, former president of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to initiate a dialogue between the then prime minister A B Vajpayee and Pakistan military ruler Pervez Musharraf. Qayyum facilitated a telephone conversation between the two leaders soon after the Agra Summit, said sources quoting from Watali‚Äôs statement to investigators.

Watali has claimed that he was told by another Kashmiri leader and also the then chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) to mediate with Pakistan and ensure Sharif‚Äôs presence at Modi‚Äôs swearing-in ceremony, said official sources linked to the case. Watali told investigators that he met Sharif at a five-star hotel in New Delhi during the visit.

Watali, who had business interests in Pakistan and some Gulf countries, has claimed that he arranged meetings of Hurriyat leaders at his residence in New Delhi to initiate dialogue between the Centre and separatist leaders on a number of occasions. Hurriyat hardline leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani attended some of these meetings, Watali told investigators.

The NIA has alleged that Watali received funds from foreign sources and distributed them to militants and separatists in Kashmir to carry out ‚Äúanti-India activities‚Äù. As part of its investigations, the agency raided multiple locations in Srinagar, Handwara, Kupwara and Baramulla linked to relatives and employees of Watali. The searches, the NIA has claimed, unearthed material related to receipt of funds by Watali.

Italy, France and Germany have asked the European Commission to reinforce existing regulations that allow EU states to block foreign acquisitions of European companies, two Italian dailies reported on Tuesday. The request cited the ‚Äògolden powers‚Äô to bar or set conditions for would-be buyers ‚Äúthat operate with rules that do not follow the market and that do not respect rules of reciprocity for acquisitions,‚Äù Il Sole 24 Ore and La Stampa reported, citing a leaked letter. European Union leaders agreed in June to consider screening investments by state-owned Chinese firms, and France, Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments.

The letter was sent to the Commission on July 28 and follows a similar one in February. Although it mentions no countries or firms by name, it appears to have been motivated by recent takeovers by Beijing in Europe. The powers would be reinforced for all target companies viewed as strategic and in cases of takeovers financed by state funds or agencies, says the ten-page document cited by the newspapers.

‚ÄúIt is not a form of protectionism but rather giving a chance of monitoring operations that are incompatible with European rules,‚Äù Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda was quoted as saying in La Stampa.

The three countries recommended that under the new regulations, which should not replace national rules, member states should notify the Commission every six months of all corporate investments from outside the bloc, except those in the defence sector.

A revamped D Y Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, with all newly fitted chairs and fabric roof, is set to host the upcoming FIFA U-17 World Cup. Navi Mumbai and Delhi will jointly host the first match of the prestigious tournament on October 6. The other four venues are ‚Äì Kochi, Guwahati, Kolkata and Goa.

‚ÄúAbsolutely, the (D Y Patil) stadium is renovated. All the new seats are put in. A new fabric roof has been installed and we have made sure the seating is done in such a manner that every spectator who sits in the stadium has a unique watching experience,‚Äù D Y Patil Sports Academy President Vijay Patil told PTI today.

‚ÄúIn terms of renovation, two practise grounds are ready in the facility (campus),‚Äù he added.

Among the other new initiatives, a solar power plant is being installed in the campus.

‚ÄúOn the infrastructure front, one of the initiatives we have taken is to ensure that environmental impact of stadium is minimised on the surroundings.

‚ÄúTo that extend, we have put in a 500 KW solar plant to take care of more than 70 per cent of electrical requirements of the stadium. That system will be commissioned by first week of October,‚Äù Patil said.

Patil said there is a palpable excitement, which he sees building up for the mega event.

‚ÄúThe World Cup will leave behind a rich legacy. What excites me is that they (people) will develop a culture of sports. This (FIFA U-17 World Cup) will be a milestone moment in football history and will change the way football will grow in the country and this is a starting point.‚Äù

Patil said all local authorities, including the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, are on board for the tournament.

We love ruffles but Jacqueline Fernandez‚Äôs take on it is simply bizarre,"Jacqueline Fernandez in an all-black look. (Source: Instagram/lakshmilehr) Jacqueline Fernandez in an all-black look. (Source: Instagram/lakshmilehr)

From rainbow-inspired pants to glamorous metallic gold tops, with the promotion of her upcoming film, A Gentleman, Jacqueline Fernandez has been giving us plenty of inspiring looks. Maybe this is what you come to expect when two experts from the industry, Anaita Shroff Adjania and Lakshmi Lehr constantly work on curating the perfect look. But even world-class celebrity stylists have their bad days and this look is one such example.

For a promotional event, Fernandez stepped out in an all-black ensemble put together by the duo. The black Deme By Gabriella crop top and the ruffled, high-low skirt from Sandro Paris Officiel allowed her to show off her perfectly toned abs but it did nothing more than that.

We think it‚Äôs one of the worst looks of the actor, ever! Even her beauty game lacked finesse and we are really disappointed. To put it bluntly, this look is a complete drab.

Another look which threw us off balance was of the actor in a colourful, knitted maxi dress by Missoni. She paired it with layered dainty necklaces and a pair of earrings from Farah Khan.

We like seeing her in figure-hugging maxis but there‚Äôs just too much going on here with this look ‚Äì it‚Äôs like the designer didn‚Äôt really put any thought into it and used every colour he could lay his hands on. Also, the gorgeous retro waves didn‚Äôt make much of a difference.

Do you like her style quotient? Let us know in the comments below.

"Donald Trump rules out hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, warns Pakistan for support to terror","US President Donald Trump. (Reuters Photo) US President Donald Trump. (Reuters Photo)

The US on Tuesday ruled out a hasty withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan as President Donald Trump warned Pakistan of consequences if it continues to provide safe havens to terror groups and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. Trump, in a prime-time televised address to the nation, laid out his South Asia policy saying a ‚Äúcritical part‚Äù of it was to further develop US‚Äô strategic partnership with India.

He said after a ‚Äúcomprehensive review‚Äù, it has been decided that the American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically.

‚ÄúA core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions. I‚Äôve said many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance, the dates we intend to begin, or end, military operations,‚Äù Trump said in his address.

‚ÄúWe will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities,‚Äù Trump said as he announced his South Asia policy in front of about 2,000 people from all five services and top officials of his administration.Trump slammed Pakistan for its continued support to terrorist groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so.

‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúPakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists,‚Äù he said, in a apparent warning to Pakistan.

The US President reached out to India seeking an enhanced role for New Delhi, especially in the economic field, to bring peace and stability in Afghanistan. India, the world‚Äôs largest democracy, is a key security and economic partner of the United States, he said.

‚ÄúWe appreciate India‚Äôs important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development,‚Äù Trump said.

Mumbai official under probe has assets ‚Äò208% more than his income‚Äô: Anti Corruption Bureau,"The ACB has also found that the bureaucrat allegedly used three businessmen, including a jeweller and a lottery shop owner, to ‚Äúround trip his funds‚Äù. (Representational Image) The ACB has also found that the bureaucrat allegedly used three businessmen, including a jeweller and a lottery shop owner, to ‚Äúround trip his funds‚Äù. (Representational Image)

The probe into the Disproportionate Assets (DPA) case by the state Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) against Vikas Rasal, CEO of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Iron and Steel Market Committee, has pegged his net worth at Rs 15- 20 crore, claimed ACB sources. This, the sources claimed, is allegedly ‚Äú208 per cent more than his known sources of income‚Äù.

The ACB has also found that the bureaucrat allegedly used three businessmen, including a jeweller and a lottery shop owner, to ‚Äúround trip his funds‚Äù. Earlier this month, a case under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 was registered against the senior Maharashtra government official at the Kalamboli police station.

This came after sleuths from the Income Tax (I-T) Department on July 7 apprehended Rasal with Rs 65.80 lakh of alleged unaccounted cash at the city airport, while he was travelling to Delhi on an Air India flight.

According to a source, ACB sleuths have recovered a diary noting from a suburban jeweller, who is one of the three businessmen who allegedly helped Rasal launder his money. The noting, written in a ‚Äòcoded-language‚Äô, pertains to the details of the alleged transactions between Rasal and the jeweller, amounting to Rs 1.6 crore.

‚ÄúOne of the three persons allegedly approached by Rasal to round trip his funds is a Vile-Parle based jeweller. We have recovered a diary from him in which he has mentioned details of his transactions with Rasal in coded language. We have cracked the code,‚Äù said an official. The police have also questioned a lottery shop owner from whom Rasal allegedly bought a lottery ticket and ‚Äúwon‚Äù Rs 2.2 crore, sources add.

‚ÄúHe claims to have won a lottery of Rs 2.2 crore, but our investigations have revealed that he did not win any lottery. He just colluded with the lottery shop owner, who, in lieu of a payment, declared him the lottery winner to help him launder his black money,‚Äù said the officer.

The sleuths have also questioned a third businessmen who deals in cash transactions and who allegedly helped Rasal launder his ‚Äúblack money‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe employed a simple modus operandi of using businessmen dealing in cash transactions to channel his black money. This helped him evade scrutiny by I-T authorities,‚Äù claimed the official.

Another senior official told The Indian Express that Rasal has nine properties, including two in Mumbai and the others in Kolhapur, Pune and Talegaon. ‚ÄúThese properties are benami and a thorough probe into their purchase and title is underway,‚Äù alleged the official.

Rasal was supervising operations of the Kalamboli Steel market yard ‚Äî a wholesale market for steel and iron. He was due for promotion to IAS cadre. ‚ÄúThis is a DPA case and therefore we won‚Äôt probe if he misused his position. Our probe will only concentrate on gathering evidence to prove that his assets and the cash found with him are 208 per cent more than his known sources of income,‚Äù said the official.

Maharashtra ACB acting Director General of Police Vivek Phansalkar confirmed the developments and said that investigations are underway. Calls and text messages sent to Rasal remained unanswered.

Manohar Parrikar sees no rival in Panaji,"Manohar Parrikar (PTI Photo) Manohar Parrikar (PTI Photo)

GOA CHIEF Minister Manohar Parrikar and his party, the BJP, exuded confidence of victory in both Assembly seats for which bypolls were held on Wednesday. Parrikar is contesting from Panaji and is pitted against Girish Chodankar of the Congress. The constituency saw 70 per cent polling Wednesday. In Valpoi, which saw 79.8 per cent voting, Congress rebel Vishwajeet Rane has Roy Naik, son of former state Home minister Ravi Naik, of the Congress as his main opponent.

Rane had won the same seat in the elections held earlier in the year but had walked out of the Assembly on the day of the floor test citing differences with the Congress. While Parrikar said after casting his vote that he ‚Äúcannot see any opposition‚Äù, senior BJP leader Shripad Naik said, ‚ÄúParrikar will win by a bigger margin than the last few times. The way BJP and Parrikar have developed the state, they deserve all the support.‚Äù

Parrikar was a five-time MLA from Panaji before he went to the Centre as defence minister. Siddharth Kuncolienkar of the BJP won the election this year. He vacated the seat for Parrikar, necessitating the bypoll. The Aam Aadmi Party, which did not win a single seat in the Assembly polls, has not fielded candidates. Congress MLAs said they were confident of a victory for Chodankar. The result is on August 28.

Shahid Afridi blasts 42-ball century in Natwest T20,"Shahid Afridi scored his first T20 century during NatWest T20 Blast match. Shahid Afridi scored his first T20 century during NatWest T20 Blast match.

Former Pakistan skipper Shahid Afridi scored 101 from 43 balls in the NatWest t20 Blast match while playing for Hampshire against Derbyshire that included ten boundaries and seven maximums. The right-hander scored his first T20 hundred in 256 matches that came in 42 deliveries. The Derbyshire skipper Gary Wilson after winning the toss elected to bowl first.

Afridi along with wicket-keeper batsman Calvin Dickinson scored 43 for the first wicket before Dickinson was out for 18 by Ben Cotton. The fall of wicket didn‚Äôt really effect Afridi‚Äôs scoring rate as he continued to hammer Derbyshire bowlers all around the park.

Afridi then stitched a partnership of 97 runs with captain James Vince for second wicket.

A maiden #T20 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ for @SAfridiOfficial, off just 42 balls! Epic. Incredible. Brutal. Sublime. Sizzling. Brilliant. BOOM BOOM! üí• pic.twitter.com/auqII1cbsN ‚Äî NatWest T20 Blast (@NatWestT20Blast) 22 August 2017

The former Pakistan cricketer‚Äôs innings was put to an end by New Zealand fast bowler Matt Henry after he pulled a short delivery only to give a catch to Ben Cotton at deep fine leg area.

A standing ovation for Boom Boom. The legend departs for 101 off 43 balls üí™ Follow the action ‚û°Ô∏èhttp://t.co/VNi5JbrMDapic.twitter.com/ZD6SOLleUW ‚Äî NatWest T20 Blast (@NatWestT20Blast) 22 August 2017

Hampshire went on to compile a total of 249/8 in 20 overs which is the highest T20 score in Derbyshire. Skipper Vince too chipped in with a fifty during their innings.

Afridi has always been known as one of the most aggressive batsmen in world cricket and the right-hander displayed his abilities in the very first innings that he played in 1996 against Sri Lanka.

The right-hander scored the then fastest hundred in limited overs which came off just 37 balls. His long-standing record was later broken by Corey Anderson in 2014 who completed hundred runs in 36 balls.

An year later, the record was grabbed by South Africa‚Äôs AB de Villiers who smacked a ton in 31 balls against West Indies in 2015.

Team India skipper Virat Kohli has achieved yet another milestone in his career as he played his 300th international match. He achieved this record as he took the field in the second ODI against Sri Lanka at Pallekele. When asked about his 300th game, Kohli said that it has been 9 years and a huge honour to wear the India cap. ‚ÄúI try to give my best whenever I step out on the field and I hope to continue doing so.‚Äù, he said.

Earlier, Indian skipper Virat Kohli had entered the record books when he became the fastest batsman to score 8000 runs in ODI cricket. He eclipsed South-African AB de Villiers‚Äô by seven innings as he reached it in his 175th innings.

Meanwhile, after registering a convincing win in the first ODI by nine wickets where Shikhar Dhawan slammed a brilliant hundred, India once again bowled out Sri Lanka for a mere 236 in the second ODI at Pallekele. After the win, Kohli spoke about how India has already started preparing for the next World Cup and will be trying out different things.

‚ÄúI think we need to start planning for the 2019 World Cup. You have to prepare 24 months in advance. We are taking that as a challenge and look to try out different things,‚Äù Kohli said and added, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to experiment and embrace that. You can see a lot of changes. All the guys have bought into it. It‚Äôs all about what gives us more balance.‚Äù

Lauding opener Shikhar Dhawan for his match winning innings he said, ‚ÄúThe last three months have been a great time for Shikhar. The good thing is that he is capitalizing on his purple patch. He can win you games with the way he bats and we would be looking to keep him in that zone for as long as we can.‚Äù

New Zealand skipper Winston Reid out of World Cup qualifiers,"Winston Reid has been ruled out of their two-legged Oceania World Cup qualifier against the Solomon Islands.

New Zealand captain Winston Reid has been ruled out of their two-legged Oceania World Cup qualifier against the Solomon Islands by an ankle injury.

The All Whites host Solomon Islands in Auckland next Friday with the return in Honiara the following Tuesday. The winner goes forward to an inter-continental playoff against a South American side for a spot in Russia next year. West Ham United‚Äôs Reid injured himself while warming up ahead of their Premier League match against Southampton at the weekend and would miss both ties, New Zealand Football said on Wednesday.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been through a tough period with regards to injury and I know he‚Äôs incredibly frustrated not to be playing for his club and for his country,‚Äù coach Anthony Hudson said in a statement.

‚ÄúBut we wish him a quick recovery and hope to see him back with us in our next games.

‚ÄúWe have lost a world-class footballer, however I know that we have the quality within the squad to get the job done.‚Äù

Striker Chris Wood, who has just moved from Leeds to Premier League Burnley, will stand in as captain for the two matches.

New Zealand, who reached the World Cup finals in 1982 and 2010, are heavy favourites to get past the Solomon Islanders but are likely to face heavyweights Argentina, Chile, Uruguay or Colombia in November‚Äôs playoff.

Esha Gupta is someone who has always managed to give us fashion goals and with the release of her next film Baadshaho, co-starring Ajay Devgn and Ileana D‚ÄôCruz, it‚Äôs only expected of her to put her best foot forward. It‚Äôs good to see that the actor has not disappointed us so far, whether it‚Äôs flaunting a deconstructed shirt or nailing the desi look.

Recently, Gupta wowed all in an Adlyn Rae dress featuring a white lapel off-shoulder neckline and a thigh slit. The nautical striped dress hugged her curves in all the right places and showed off her toned legs perfectly.

Celebrity stylist Reann Moradian accessorised her look with minimal jewellery from Accessorize and FiFi Jewels and a pair of pretty silver Jimmy Choo heels with bright orange studs on it, while, celebrity hairstylist Mehak Oberoi styled her hair into gorgeous retro side swept waves. We are totally in love with this look.

Then, for another event Gupta kept it simple and really chic in a blue floral print jacket and fitted pants from Twelve AM:PM. We love how she wore it with the white pussy bow blouse.

The studded ankle strap heels from Charles and Keith complemented her outfit well. The entire look gave out a very relaxed vibe and that‚Äôs what we like about it. Pulling her hair up into a romantic, low bun was a good idea.

She also impressed us with her desi swag. The sage green anarkali which celebrity stylist Aastha Sharma picked for the actor looked lovely on her.

Throughout the Rio Olympics, Sakshi Malik came from behind in the repechage round to win a bronze medal. Her wrestling style saw her tire out her opponent in the first period before making a strong move in the second period to pull off the win. Even in the bronze medal play-off she won the bout by taking her opponent down in the final seconds.

Malik had 20 seconds left to make a comeback after trailing 3-2 in her pre quarter-final against Germany‚Äôs Luisa Niemesch in 53kg category at the World Wrestling Championships on Thursday. But unlike Rio, she could not do it here. The bronze medallist suffered a loss and had to bow out of the Championships. She was not pulled back in repechage as her opponent lost in the next round.

FIFA intervenes in Cameroon to try to end bickering,"FIFA will intervene in Cameroon‚Äôs football federation. FIFA will intervene in Cameroon‚Äôs football federation.

FIFA is to intervene in Cameroon‚Äôs football federation (FECAFOOT) again in an attempt to end bickering among officials which has dragged on since 2015, soccer‚Äôs governing body said on Wednesday.

FIFA said it had set up a ‚Äúnormalisation committee‚Äù to run FECAFOOT‚Äôs daily affairs, draft new statutes and organise elections for a new executive committee by the end of February.

It said the decision followed ‚Äúrecent failed attempts by FIFA to reconcile the football stakeholders in Cameroon and overcome the current impasse‚Äù.

FIFA briefly suspended Cameroon in 2013 for government interference in FECAFOOT, then also set up a normalisation committee to run its affairs.

A hotly contested election in 2015 was subsequently annulled by the Cameroon National Sports and Olympic Committee‚Äôs arbitration chamber. That decision was then confirmed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

Despite the off-field problems, Cameroon won the African Nations Cup earlier this year, beating Egypt 2-1 in the final.

However, they face a tough task in their World Cup qualifying group which also contains bitter rivals Nigeria, plus Zambia and Algeria.

Nigeria have won their first two games while Cameroon have drawn their first two, allowing the Super Eagles to open up a four-point gap. Only the group winners qualify for Russia next year.

Cameroon will host the African Nations Cup in 2019.

"At Arizona rally, Donald Trump defends response to Charlottesville violence","U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

President Donald Trump, surrounded by thousands of supporters on Tuesday, defended his response to the violence at a rally organized by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, and attacked the media for ‚Äúgiving a platform to hate groups.‚Äù Trump told the friendly crowd at the political rally in Arizona that his words in the aftermath of the Virginia event had been ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù He revved up the crowd with criticism of journalists, who he said did not report what he had said. Many in the crowd turned and pointed at reporters in the room. Some chanted ‚ÄúCNN sucks.‚Äù

Trump also suggested he might pardon Joe Arpaio, a former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, who was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case. Arpaio, 85, lost a re-election bid last year in the county.

‚ÄúDo the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?‚Äù Trump asked, sparking loud applause and a chant of ‚ÄúPardon Joe!‚Äù

‚ÄúWas Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?‚Äù Trump asked, before predicting that Arpaio would be just fine. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do it tonight because I don‚Äôt want to cause any controversy,‚Äù he said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters traveling with Trump on Air Force One earlier on Tuesday: ‚ÄúThere will be no discussion of that today at any point and no action will be taken on that front at any point today.‚Äù

BROAD CRITICISM

Trump drew broad criticism for blaming both white nationalists and counter-protesters for the deadly violence at the Charlottesville rally, which was organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. One woman was killed. Protesters outside Tuesday‚Äôs rally yelled: ‚ÄúShame, shame, shame‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA‚Äù as the Trump supporters began filing into the Phoenix Convention Center.

Supporters, who lined up for hours in the Arizona heat ahead of the event, chanted: ‚ÄúBuild the wall,‚Äù a reference to Trump‚Äôs pledge to erect a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Many wore red hats with Trump‚Äôs campaign slogan, ‚ÄúMake America Great Again.‚Äù Trump has held a series of 2020 re-election campaign stops despite only having taken office in January. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, had asked him to postpone Tuesday‚Äôs event, scheduled for 7 pm MST (0200 GMT Wednesday), while the nation healed from outrage and division after the deadly rally in Charlottesville.

Neither John McCain nor Jeff Flake, Arizona‚Äôs senators, was expected to attend the Phoenix event, said a source familiar with Flake‚Äôs re-election campaign and published reports, underscoring Trump‚Äôs fractious relationship with some in his own party.

Republican Governor Doug Ducey told the Arizona Republic on Monday that he would welcome Trump on the tarmac when he arrived but would not attend the rally. Before flying to Phoenix, the state capital, Trump landed in Yuma, Arizona, near the Mexican border, for a tour of border security facilities. He is seeking congressional funding for the wall he wants built along the border to deter illegal immigration..

HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE

A heavy police presence deployed around the Phoenix venue. Some White House officials privately expressed concern on Monday about Trump‚Äôs Phoenix rally, fearing he might revisit the Charlottesville issue in the heat of the moment while cheered on by supporters. ‚ÄúThe president is always welcome in Arizona,‚Äù Flake spokesman Will Allison said in an emailed statement. Flake ‚Äúhopes the president will speak constructively about moving forward with tax reform, border security, and other important issues facing our country,‚Äù Allison said.

Earlier this summer, Flake published a book questioning the direction of the Republican Party in the Trump era, making him one of the few party members willing to criticize the president. Last week, Trump sent a tweet voicing support for Flake‚Äôs challenger, Kelli Ward, in next year‚Äôs Arizona Senate Republican primary. In the tweet, Trump called Flake ‚Äútoxic‚Äù and ‚Äúweak.‚Äù

The president has also made caustic remarks about McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee and war hero, who is battling cancer. A spokesman for McCain could not be reached immediately. The Phoenix event is Trump‚Äôs first trip as president to Arizona, which he won in the 2016 election.

New-look Bengaluru FC resume Asian campaign,"Bengaluru FC reached the AFC Cup final but lost to Iran in the title clash. (Source: Reuters) Bengaluru FC reached the AFC Cup final but lost to Iran in the title clash. (Source: Reuters)

Three months after they last played a continental match, Bengaluru FC will resume their AFC Cup campaign on Wednesday when they take on North Korean giants April 25 Sports Club in the inter-zonal semifinal. However, this will be a very different Bengaluru side compared to the one that played in the group stages.

After moving from I-League to the Indian Super League, Bengaluru had to dissolve their entire squad to meet the latter‚Äôs requirements. After retaining a couple of players, including striker Sunil Chhetri, they had to rebuild their team in the ISL draft last month. All this left coach Albert Roca with very little time to prepare for Wednesday‚Äôs clash.

The Blues will be without the services of talismanic defender John Johnson, who is away for personal reasons, and Braulio Nobrega, who isn‚Äôt part of the squad. The biggest addition to the squad was made last week when they signed goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu from Norwegian side Stabaek. Sandhu is set to play his first club match in India since leaving East Bengal in 2013. And he will have his task cut-out.

April 25 have scored 14 goals in their four group stage matches while conceded just three. They have traveled with a young side, with an average age of less than 23. Their star performer has been 22-year-old striker Kim Yu-Song, who has has netted nine goals so far from four matches ‚Äì more than what Bengaluru have managed so far this season (seven).

The stakes are high. If Bengaluru win this two-legged tie ‚Äì return leg will be played on September 13 in Pyongyang ‚Äì they will take on the winner of the other inter-zone semifinals play-off between FC Istiklol of Tajikistan and ASEAN Zonal champion in the inter-zone final.

(Steve Gonzales/Houston Chronicle via AP)

Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko Petroleum and Exxon Mobil announced they were curbing some oil and gas output on Wednesday at facilities in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of a storm expected to hit the Texas coast later this week.

The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a hurricane watch Wednesday for much of the Texas coast, calling for slow-moving Tropical Depression Harvey to intensify as it nears landfall.

Shell said it was evacuating all personnel from the roughly 100,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Perdido oil and gas production platform as a precaution. Anadarko said it had shut in production and was evacuating workers from its Boomvang, Gunnison, Lucius and Nansen platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.

Exxon was in the process of reducing production at its Hoover facility in the Gulf of Mexico, company spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said.

The company said it was also working on transportation plans for staged evacuation of its personnel from its offshore facilities, expected to be in the path of the storm, to shore.

The US Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of the nation‚Äôs crude oil output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the US Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation‚Äôs oil refining capacity is along the US Gulf Coast.

Harvey, which had top sustained winds of about 35 miles (55 km) per hour as it churned over Mexico‚Äôs Bay of Campeche late Wednesday, could become a hurricane by Friday, the NHC said in an advisory.

Between 10 inches and 15 inches (25 cm to 38 cm) of rain are expected from the central Texas coast to southwest Louisiana, with some areas receiving up to 20 inches of rain, according to the Miami-based NHC.

‚ÄúHeavy rainfall is likely to spread across portions of eastern Texas, Louisiana, and the lower Mississippi Valley from Friday through early next week and could cause life-threatening flooding,‚Äù the NHC said.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster for 30 counties ahead of the storm.

In Corpus Christi, city officials warned residents to expect a storm surge of between four feet and six feet (1.83 m) and began distributing sand bags to local residents.

Other Gulf of Mexico oil and gas operators said they were watching developments closely but operations were unaffected.

Chevron on Wednesday afternoon said it had not evacuated any staff and BP Plc said normal operations were still underway. ConocoPhillips said it was making preparations but had not interrupted any operations.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov says US and Russia aren‚Äôt in new Cold War,"Ryabkov emphasized that Russia refrained from any steps that ‚Äúif asymmetrical, not tit-for-tat, could harm regional and global stability.‚Äù (AP Photo) Ryabkov emphasized that Russia refrained from any steps that ‚Äúif asymmetrical, not tit-for-tat, could harm regional and global stability.‚Äù (AP Photo)

Russia and the United States aren‚Äôt in a new Cold War despite spiraling tensions, a senior Russian diplomat said in remarks released Wednesday. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov denounced US sanctions against Russia, but emphasized that the current tension ‚Äúisn‚Äôt equivalent to confrontation that may spill into open conflict.‚Äù He added, however, that Russia and the US need to refresh their agreements on preventing incidents at sea and in the air.

Speaking to Japanese and Chinese media in remarks released by his ministry, Ryabkov said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that such confrontation is possible.‚Äù He added that decades of experience have taught Moscow and Washington caution ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that we are in a state of a new Cold War because there are no grounds for a Cold War in the old meaning of the word, meaning a confrontation between systems and ideologies, ideological rivalry,‚Äù Ryabkov said.

Russia-US relations have plunged to post-Cold War lows over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and the accusations of Russian meddling in last year‚Äôs US presidential vote. Ryabkov said that about 400 Russian entities and some 200 Russian citizens have been targeted by the US sanctions. He reaffirmed Moscow‚Äôs denial of interference in the US election, dismissing the accusations as ‚Äúcollective madness.‚Äù

He argued that Russia‚Äôs response to the US sanctions has been ‚Äúquite restrained and modest,‚Äù adding that Moscow doesn‚Äôt view relations with Washington as a zero-sum game.

Ryabkov emphasized that Russia refrained from any steps that ‚Äúif asymmetrical, not tit-for-tat, could harm regional and global stability.‚Äù

‚ÄúRussia is fully aware of its measure of responsibility in this field,‚Äù he said, noting that Russia and the US have reached a significant progress in their efforts to settle the Syrian crisis. The Kremlin has responded to sanctions approved by the US Congress by ordering sharp cuts of U.S. diplomatic personnel in Russia.

Ryabkov scathingly criticized the US decision to indefinitely suspend issuing visas at its consulates in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok in response to the Russian decision to cap embassy staff. ‚ÄúBy depriving Russian citizens of the possibility to receive visas freely and easily, the United States is turning itself into its own opposite,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSome would think it‚Äôs time to open a bottle of champagne because the US is destroying itself, while others would see it as a sad moment because it would be more difficult to get access to the American values and benefits.‚Äù

True test of SC ruling on right to privacy will depend on its application,"While the position of privacy as a fundamental right was uncontested till 2015, the importance of this decision cannot be emphasized enough. While the position of privacy as a fundamental right was uncontested till 2015, the importance of this decision cannot be emphasized enough.

By Kritika Bhardwaj

A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court delivered its verdict on status of the right to privacy today. In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the right to privacy as a fundamental right. Importantly, the Court held that that privacy is not just an integral part of the right to life and personal liberty, but is secured by all other fundamental rights as well.

Today‚Äôs ruling emerges from a batch of petitions challenging the Aadhaar project ‚Äì India‚Äôs contentious biometric identification scheme. In 2015, during one of the hearings in this case, the Central Government had contested the existence of the fundamental right to privacy. This contention was based on the argument that since two early decisions of the Court had expressly rejected incorporating privacy as a fundamental right, subsequent smaller benches could not have done so. Today‚Äôs decision explicitly overrules these two decisions ‚Äì M.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra and Kharak Singh v. State of Punjab, in so far as their observations on privacy were concerned.

It also affirms that the Court‚Äôs extensive jurisprudence on privacy, spanning over forty years, is good law. The challenge to the validity of the Aadhaar project will now be decided on the strength of today‚Äôs decision.

While the position of privacy as a fundamental right was uncontested till 2015, the importance of this decision cannot be emphasized enough. Some of the main grounds for challenging Aadhaar are its violation of physical privacy (by forcefully capturing biometrics), and its surveillance potential (by aggregation of independent data silos). By reaffirming that privacy is an inherent aspect of dignity and liberty, and consequently deeply embedded within our Constitutional scheme, this judgment will ensure a more rigorous analysis of Aadhaar‚Äôs impact on individual rights.

However, the significance of this decision goes beyond its impact on Aadhaar. At the outset, it is important to note that the judges have restrained themselves from exhaustively cataloguing the right, or any limitations to it. Privacy is often invoked in myriad circumstances, and has traditionally been tough to define. The approach of the Supreme Court had always been to develop the right on a case-by- case basis and it is heartening that the judgment acknowledges that changing time and technology can impact the right in unforeseen ways.

Another significant impact of this judgment will be on the pending petition challenging the Supreme Court‚Äôs earlier verdict in the Section 377 case. In a disappointing (to say the least) judgment in 2014, the Court had upheld the validity of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, resulting in re-criminalisation of sex between consenting adults of the same sex. Today‚Äôs judgment expresses strong contempt for the reasoning in this case and expressly holds that sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of one‚Äôs identity, and is therefore closely related to dignity and privacy.

It was also noted that besides an obligation to not interfere with an individual‚Äôs privacy, the state also has a positive obligation to protect the right. In the absence of any legislation on privacy, it could be argued that such

an obligation extends to protecting individuals against discriminatory data practices of corporations and other non-state actors.

It is true that the true test of the ruling will depend on its application. It is still possible for the Court to uphold the validity of Aadhaar if it feels that the scheme is a justifiable intrusion of privacy. However, an unequivocal recognition of the importance of the right is more than just an encouraging sign. Today‚Äôs judgment acknowledges the importance of a right to privacy in the context of autonomy, dignity and liberty. It is hoped that in the face of unjustifiable intrusions, the Court will continue to uphold and enlarge this right in a meaningful manner.

India emerging as important regional partner for US: Rex Tillerson,"Tillerson also praised India‚Äôs role in Afghanistan. (File) Tillerson also praised India‚Äôs role in Afghanistan. (File)

India is emerging as a very important regional strategic partner for the US that can help modernise Afghanistan both politically and economically, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said today. Tillerson‚Äôs remarks came after President Donald Trump unveiled the US strategy in Afghanistan which included expanded authorities to target terrorists.

‚ÄúIndia is emerging as a very important regional strategic partner with the United States, and has played an important role supporting the Afghan government and in particular supporting their economy,‚Äù Tillerson told reporters. He also praised India‚Äôs role in Afghanistan. ‚ÄúIndia has provided development assistance. They‚Äôve provided economic assistance. They are hosting an important economic conference in India this next week. All of that is important to stabilising Afghanistan as a nation,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúGet their economy functioning, stabilise the country so that they can provide more opportunities to their citizens. These are all elements of what will lead to stability and ultimately a peace agreement,‚Äù he said. Responding to a question, the Secretary of State sought the help of India in changing Pakistan‚Äôs behaviour. ‚ÄúIt is important that Pakistan begin to think about its ability to contain these groups as well. It‚Äôs why, though, we take a regional approach. The US alone is not going to change this dynamic with Pakistan,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIndia and Pakistan, they have their own issues that they have to continue to work through. But I think there are areas where perhaps even India can take some steps, a rapprochement on issues with Pakistan to improve the stability within Pakistan and remove some of the reasons why they deal with these unstable elements inside their own country,‚Äù Tillerson said.

According to the Secretary of State, other regional players have strong interest in Pakistan. ‚ÄúChina has strong interest in Pakistan. Having a stable, secure future Pakistan is in a lot of our interests. They are a nuclear power. We have concerns about their weapons, the security of their weapons. There are many areas in which we believe we should be having very productive dialogue that serves both of our interests and regional interests as well,‚Äù Tillerson said.

"EPS pushes to sack Sasikala, avoid floor test as Dinakaran digs heels in","Chief Minister E K Palaniswami leaves State Secretariat. (Source: PTI Photo) Chief Minister E K Palaniswami leaves State Secretariat. (Source: PTI Photo)

AMID REPORTS that nine more AIADMK MLAs, including four ministers, may join deputy general secretary T T V Dinakaran, top sources in the ruling faction said they were taking ‚Äúemergency steps‚Äù to expel party general secretary V K Sasikala at a general council meeting to be held before August 31.

Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Wednesday called all senior ministers for an urgent meeting in Chennai Thursday. ‚ÄúThe meeting will discuss two strategies: how to avoid a floor test, and how to speed up the process of sacking Sasikala from the party,‚Äù said a senior minister.

Sasikala‚Äôs expulsion will bring back MLAs from the Dinakaran camp, said a minister close to Chief Minister. ‚ÄúThat is the only reason for them to stay in the Dinakaran camp. They will have to come back and save this government if Sasikala and Dinakaran are expelled,‚Äù he said, confirming that the general Council meeting to formally remove Sasikala would be held in the next fortnight.

‚ÄúThere may be 10 to 20 per cent Sasikala supporters, who are expected to oppose the decision to expel her. We have to deal with that challenge,‚Äù he said. Meanwhile, fearing that Sasikala‚Äôs supporters may be prevented from attending the General Council meeting, the Dinakaran camp is likely to file a petition in the Madras High Court seeking its intervention.

In the 233-member Tamil Nadu Assembly, Dinakaran already has the support of at least 22 MLAs (including three Independents), a number that can endanger the majority the ruling party has in the Assembly. While there are 123 AIADMK MLAs in all, nine more MLAs ‚Äî including two ministers who lost key portfolios in the Cabinet reshuffle following the merger of the two factions led by Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam earlier this week ‚Äî are reported to be backing Dinakaran.

On the ruling group‚Äôs plan to delay the floor test for now, another minister said the situation was in their favour as Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao is expected to go abroad, on a vacation, within the next few days. However, when contacted, Rao‚Äôs spokesperson in Chennai said the Governor was in Mumbai and he did not have any information about his holidays plans. Rao‚Äôs office in Mumbai said he was set to attend a number of programmes in the city in the coming days.

With the DMK also demanding a floor test, a senior Raj Bhawan official said Rao may find it difficult to delay it. ‚ÄúThere may be different opinions and advice to buy more time to take the right decision,‚Äù said the source. Meanwhile, a senior leader close to Dinakaran said if the floor test was delayed, they would approach the court. He said they would ask the court to appoint a sitting judge to monitor the General Council meeting.

‚ÄúIf the court can assure transparency in the election of a much smaller film actors‚Äô body, it will intervene in our party‚Äôs General Council meeting‚Ä¶ External powers (have been) visibly trying to destabilise the government and the party for over six months,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have information that they are planning to use the police and intelligence forces to prevent our people from attending the General Council meeting, in order to pass a unanimous decision to expel Sasikala. We cannot allow that to happen,‚Äù he said.

"Athletics has not grown as the focus was just on Usain Bolt, says Carl Lewis","Usain Bolt called time on his athletics career with a bronze medal at World Championship. (Source: Reuters) Usain Bolt called time on his athletics career with a bronze medal at World Championship. (Source: Reuters)

The last decade in world athletics belonged to Usain Bolt but the legendary Carl Lewis is not happy with the singular focus on the Jamaican showman. Considered the greatest athlete of all time, Jamaican Bolt drew curtains on his illustrious career after a disappointing performance at the World Championship in London, where he could only win a bronze in the 100m.

‚ÄúThe sport is not just about one person. Nobody is irreplaceable. Track and field survived many civilisations. Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson and now Usain Bolt. Men will all come and go but the sport will always remain,‚Äù Lewis, who has won nine Olympic gold medals, told PTI in an exclusive interview.

With Bolt‚Äôs retirement, Lewis feels that it‚Äôs time to build on the sport now that people will get over their obsession with a singular man. ‚ÄúWe need to do more to build on the sport. We don‚Äôt need to follow that trend that we have been in the last eight years, which was just about following one person (Bolt),‚Äù Lewis didn‚Äôt mince words as he spoke on the sidelines of the 29th Summer Universiade.

‚ÄúOur job is to fill the void. In the last 10 years, the sport has not grown as the focus was just on one man. The point is we need to build competition. We now have a unique chance to rebuild and grow our sport. Now we have a chance to make a difference, grow our sport and not just grow yourself,‚Äù Lewis‚Äô sarcasm on Bolt‚Äôs cult status was pretty much evident.

Lewis, who won Long Jump gold in four successive Olympic Games (1984, 88, 92 and 96), is not at all amused that ‚ÄòBrand Bolt‚Äô became bigger than the sport. ‚ÄúWe were just so caught up trying to make one person all about the whole sport and now we have a unique opportunity to spread it across the board and really allow it grow,‚Äù said Lewis.

Lewis termed World Championship 100m silver medallist Christian Coleman and Rio bronze medallist Canadian Andre de Grasse are the ones to watch out for in the coming years. ‚ÄúChristian Coleman was second (in World Championships) behind Justin Gatlin and he had the fastest time this year. Gatlin is 35 years old and that was probably his last Major championship. I think De Grasse and Coleman are both great athletes and I am really excited about them,‚Äù Lewis is confident that they can maintain the standard set by Bolt.

Lewis, is in Taiwan as the assistant coach of the US track and field University team and named young Cameron Burrell as the next big thing among American track and field. Young Cameron competes both in 100m and long jump like Lewis and is the son of Lewis‚Äô former teammate Leroy Burrell (a 1991 World Championship 100m bronze medallist) and Olympic relay champion.

Lewis and Burrell Sr also competed together for the famous Santa Monica Track Club. ‚ÄúI was a long jumper who ran sprints. And now Cameron is trying to do that. I would love to see that. He is a great kid and he has the potential to become an Olympic champion,‚Äù Lewis opined.

Justin Gatlin won gold medal in the 100m sprint at the World Championship to beat Usain Bolt who finished third. (Source: AP) Justin Gatlin won gold medal in the 100m sprint at the World Championship to beat Usain Bolt who finished third. (Source: AP)

With Cameron‚Äôs reference, Lewis took another dig at Bolt. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the great thing about our sport and I think Cameron is going to be an Olympics champion one day and Coleman is also going to be an Olympic champion. Everyone just wants to talk about the garden centre instead of lumber area or the clothing area. We have a great sport that we need to spread it across and talk about the unique relationships. Don‚Äôt let people get into the box where it is about just one person.‚Äù

Lewis however did not like termed the booing of Gatlin after winning the 100m dash at the recent World Championships ahead of Bolt as ‚Äúchildish‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt was unfair. I am not saying what he has done is right. But it was childish,‚Äù he said.

"Sri Lanka does not look confident and isn‚Äôt hungry enough in the middle, says Mahela Jayawardene","Mahela Jayawardena is hoping that Sri Lanka can find a solution for their problems soon. (Source: Express Archive) Mahela Jayawardena is hoping that Sri Lanka can find a solution for their problems soon. (Source: Express Archive)

Former Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene has claimed that fear of failure is one of the main reasons behind Sri Lanka‚Äôs poor run of form. It may be recalled here that after losing the one-day series to Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka lost the Test series to India and are now 1-0 down in the one-day series. This led to Jayawardene claiming that the Lankan side‚Äôs confidence is low and they don‚Äôt look hungry enough in the middle. Hence, he also called for an urgent need to address the problems plaguing the Lankan side and also finding solutions quickly.

‚ÄúI feel the team‚Äôs confidence is low. The fear of failure factor has come out. They don‚Äôt look confident, they don‚Äôt look hungry enough in the middle. They need to address that and find solutions very quickly.‚Äù, Jayawardene said in an interview with Cricinfo and added, ‚ÄúTalking about the whitewash against India, Jayawardene said the team failed in all departments. I am sure the guys would be very disappointed with their performance in the Test series. It was a great challenge for them to test themselves against the number one team. They didn‚Äôt handle certain situations well. First innings batting too let them down when there was no demon in the wickets. They also never looked like getting 20 wickets.‚Äù

However, praising Indian skipper Virat Kohli, he said, ‚ÄúLook he is a pro active captain. He is very aggressive. He has a brilliant record to start with, though most of the games were played din India, you still have to win matches. He has led the team from the front so the rest of the boys are following on and off the field. The Test for them now will be playing away from home. They have created a good nucleus of players who are taking responsibility. There is good competition for batting and bowling positions.‚Äù

Lauding Hardik Pandya for his performance, he said, ‚ÄúHe is an amazing talent, especially for the shorter formats of the game. To have someone who can bowl between 130 -140kmph is a great addition to the side. You saw his batting skills as well. He has the temperament to go big when he needs to. At the same time, he can bat for time. It gives India a lot of options.

‚ÄúHis value is no less as a fast bowler, said Jayawardene. He has given India the combination they were craving for. To have five bowlers with three quicks and two spinners. It lends a nice balance to the side,‚Äù he added.

Rocket strikes downtown Kabul: Report,"A rocket struck the heart of Kabul‚Äôs government and diplomatic area on Monday night, setting off alarms and sirens at foreign embassies, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Police said the rocket landed on a secure road just outside the presidential palace and near an area housing other Afghan government offices, foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of the international military coalition.

The blast was preceded by ‚Äúincoming‚Äù announcements on loudspeakers, often used by the American embassy to warn of an imminent rocket attack.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Taliban and Islamic State militants have stepped up attacks on the Afghan capital, making it the country‚Äôs deadliest city for civilians this year.

Monday‚Äôs rocket strike came just hours before U.S. President Donald Trump was to give a prime-time speech outlining the future of the American presence in Afghanistan.

US military commanders have asked for several thousand more troops to help train and assist Afghan security forces struggling to contain the growing Islamist insurgency.

"‚ÄòRight to privacy a fundamental right‚Äô; Opposition calls it a blow to ‚Äòfascist forces‚Äô, Centre says verdict affirms govt view","Right to privacy ruling: A nine-judge bench of the constitution bench unanimously held that right to privacy is a guaranteed fundamental right. Right to privacy ruling: A nine-judge bench of the constitution bench unanimously held that right to privacy is a guaranteed fundamental right.

In a landmark verdict, the Supreme Court on Thursday held Right to Privacy as a fundamental right, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. ‚ÄúPrivacy intrinsic to freedom of life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of Constitution,‚Äù the nine-judge bench unanimously observed. The bench overruled decisions in M P Sharma case and Kharak Singh case which had said right to privacy was not protected by Constitution. ‚ÄúThe decisions stand overruled‚Äù, it said.

The verdict has significant consequences for the common man as it will empower him/her with a powerful tool to fight unlawful intrusions by the state into their personal lives. But the very fact that the court has traced it to part 3 would mean that the restrictions applicable to other fundamental rights will also apply to privacy. The judgement will also form the basis on which petitions challenging the Aadhaar Act will now proceed.

Progression of the case

The question about right to privacy was first raised before a bench which was hearing a clutch of petitions challenging the Centre‚Äôs move to make Aadhaar mandatory to benefit from social and welfare schemes. The verdict was reserved after hearing marathon arguments for six days over a period of three weeks, during which submissions were advanced in favour and against the inclusion of the right to privacy as a fundamental right.

During the six-day hearing, senior counsel Gopal Subramanium, who argued for declaring privacy a fundamental right, had said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶privacy was embedded in the expressions liberty and dignity as appearing in the Preamble to the Constitution. Liberty is inalienable‚Ä¶ all choices are a part of the exercise of liberty‚Ä¶ humans cannot exist without liberty‚Ä¶ liberty is heart and soul of the Constitution.‚Äù

Senior counsel Soli Sorabjee, who also argued for declaring privacy a fundamental right, had said, ‚ÄúNon-mentioning of privacy rights explicitly in the fundamental rights does not signify it does not exist. It can be deduced from other fundamental rights mentioned in Part III of the Constitution. Freedom of press too was not mentioned but deduced so.‚Äù

The Centre, which argued against privacy being a ‚Äúwholly qualified‚Äù fundamental right, had said it would be subject to reasonable restrictions, just like other fundamental rights. Attorney General K K Venugopal had said, ‚ÄúSince the right to privacy consists of diverse aspects and is a sub-species of the right to liberty, every aspect of sub-species will not qualify as a fundamental right‚Äù. Venugopal said privacy, as a right, could not be seen in isolation, and was, in fact, a ‚Äúconglomerate of rights‚Äù which had to be treated on a case-to-case basis.

Meaning of the verdict on Aadhaar

While this verdict settles the issue that privacy is indeed a fundamental right as read into the Constitution, the issue of Aadhaar being made compulsory for various schemes is yet to be examined and decided by the Court.

The verdict urges the government to consider and create a ‚Äúrobust regime for data protection. The creation of such a regime requires a careful and sensitive balance between individual interests and legitimate concerns of the state.‚Äù Even when the Supreme Court judgment talks about keeping digital privacy intact, it is also taking into consideration the ideas of ‚Äúprotecting national security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging innovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing the dissipation of social welfare benefits.‚Äù

‚ÄúInformational privacy is a facet of the right to privacy,‚Äù the SC judgement reads. ‚ÄúInformational privacy is a facet of the right to privacy,‚Äù the SC judgement reads.

Privacy and sexual orientation

The judgement also ushered in hope for the LGBTQ community as the apex court concluded that privacy includes the preservation of personal intimacies at its core and that sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy. The court held that privacy and protection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.

‚ÄúThe purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of majorities, whether legislative or popular. The guarantee of constitutional rights does not depend upon their exercise being favourably regarded by majoritarian opinion,‚Äù the court held, adding that ‚Äúthe Koushal rationale that prosecution of a few is not an index of violation is flawed and cannot be accepted.‚Äù

The court concluded that privacy includes the preservation of personal intimacies at its core and that sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy. (File ‚Äì Express photo by Partha Paul) The court concluded that privacy includes the preservation of personal intimacies at its core and that sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy. (File ‚Äì Express photo by Partha Paul)

The Supreme Court further held that ‚Äúdiscrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual. Equality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be protected on an even platform. The right to privacy and the protection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.‚Äù

Opposition hails the judgement

The verdict was hailed as a historic and positive one by many leaders. CPI(M)‚Äôs Sitaram Yechury tweeted, ‚ÄúCongratulations to all lawyers, activists, others who fought this govt‚Äôs sinister designs to deny Indians their fundamental right to privacy. A far-reaching judgement which will have consequences in various domains, as technology is playing a greater role in our day-to-day lives. We have been opposed to mandatory Aadhaar, data misuse by foreign tech corporates. This judgement will pave the way for securing our rights.‚Äù

Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said the judgment strikes at ‚Äúunbridled encroachment and surveillance‚Äù by the State and its agencies on the life of the common man. She added that Congress and other opposition parties have together spoken for the right to privacy against ‚Äúarrogant‚Äù attempts of BJP govt to curtail them.

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi echoed similar views. He welcomed the verdict, and said that it was a major blow to ‚Äúfascist forces‚Äù and a rejection of the BJP‚Äôs ideology of ‚Äúsuppression through surveillance‚Äù. The judgment was a ‚Äúvictory for every Indian‚Äù, Gandhi said on Twitter.

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav thanked the Supreme Court for its ruling.

Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram also welcomed the verdict. ‚ÄúPrivacy is a fundamental right. The freedom that was won in 1947 has been enriched and enlarged. Privacy is the core of personal liberty. Article 21 has acquired a new magnificence,‚Äù he tweeted.

Centre says ‚ÄòCrux of Supreme Court judgment wider affirmation of govt view‚Äô

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad welcomed the judgement on behalf of the Centreand said the ‚Äúessence of the judgment is a wider affirmation of the crux of the observation made by the finance minister while moving the Aadhaar act in the house‚Äù.

‚ÄúOn behalf of the government of India, Attorney General has also argued that right to privacy is a part of fundamental rights, with reasonable restrictions,‚Äù Prasad said. He added that it is ‚Äúunknown in civilised existence that a government was seeking to collect data of its countrymen without the authority of law‚Äù.

Finance Minister Arun Jailtey blamed the UPA government for the Aadhaar issue going to court. ‚ÄúPrivacy issue went to Supreme Court because previous UPA government brought Aadhaar without legal framework,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPrivacy issue went to Supreme Court because previous UPA government brought Aadhaar without legal framework,‚Äù he added.

He called the verdict a positive development. ‚ÄúSC accepted privacy is a fundamental right but not an absolute right; judgement is a positive development.‚Äù

Navodaya recalls order to remove Gandhi family photos from sites,"Former prime minister of India Rajiv Gandhi. (Source: file photo) Former prime minister of India Rajiv Gandhi. (Source: file photo)

ON AUGUST 16, the Shillong regional office of the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) instructed all 90 schools under its jurisdiction in the Northeast to remove photographs of the Gandhi family from their websites and use those of ‚Äúour commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, HRD minister and Prime Minister‚Äù. On Tuesday, a day after The Indian Express sought an official comment on this, the circular was withdrawn.

A new circular, dated August 22 and signed by Deputy Commissioner (Shillong region) D S Kumar, reads: ‚ÄúKindly refer to the email dated 16.08.17 relating to the maintenance of official website of the vidyalayas which was sent by a supporting staff of NVS, RO (Regional Office), Shillong in the name of the Deputy Commissioner, NVS, RO, Shillong without knowledge of the undersigned. Therefore it is to inform that the said email maybe treated as invalid for all purposes.‚Äù

The email of August 16 had stated: ‚ÄúFirst all old photograph of Gandhi‚Äôs family is to be removed and new photographs olf (sic) our commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, HRD minister and Prime Minister is to be incorporated.‚Äù The email further stated that every school‚Äôs website should state that it comes under the purview of the Shillong regional office and that the websites should be bilingual ‚Äî it did not clarify what the two languages should be.

On Wednesday morning, Kumar told The Indian Express that a memorandum had been issued to a staffer who allegedly sent the email on his behalf on August 16. ‚ÄúI look after two regions, that‚Äôs Patna and Shillong. Once I resumed my duty here (Shillong) yesterday (Tuesday), I have made it clear that no such circular has been issued by anyone, including me. The employee who is looking after (this task), a lady, I have given her a memorandum also,‚Äù he said.

Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) have been associated with Rajiv Gandhi as they were set up in in the 1980s under his prime ministership. Many JNVs even have a small green area on campus, called ‚ÄòRajiv Gandhi Smriti Van‚Äô, dedicated to the former prime minister. Some schools, ‚Äî for instance JNVs in Puducherry, and one in Hathras, UP ‚Äî also have his photograph on their official websites.

JNVs are residential and co-educational schools affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) with classes from VI to XII and tasked with finding and educating talented children in rural areas. There are 598 JNVs run by the NVS, an autonomous organisation under the HRD Ministry.

Niti Aayog for clear guidelines on data protection,"The NITI Aayog office in New Delhi. (Files) The NITI Aayog office in New Delhi. (Files)

Government think tank Niti Aayog on Thursday called for a comprehensive framework on data protection specially covering digital transactions. ‚ÄúCurrently, India has no comprehensive privacy or data protection laws that cover digital payments specifically. An existing law for data protection, section 43(A) of the Information Technology Act (ITA), offers basic protection,‚Äù Niti Aayog said in its three year action plan.

The recommendation coincides with the Supreme Court order declaring right to privacy as fundamental right. In the judgement, the apex court too has expressed concern over data privacy of people. ‚ÄúData related to digital transactions could be sold and the consequences would be unpredictable. Increasing the number of digital transactions also means the generation of data around these transactions,‚Äù the report said.

The report acknowledged that from a transparency perspective, the additional data will help with better governance and prevent tax evasion. ‚ÄúHowever, without any clear guidelines on ownership, use and sharing of the data, there is a large scope for misuse. This should be addressed as early as possible as an increasing number of people transact digitally,‚Äù the report said.

"Jamiat defiant: Triple talaq is still valid, punish if you wish to","Maulana Mahmood Madani Maulana Mahmood Madani

Striking a defiant note a day after the Supreme Court set aside the practice of instant triple talaq or talaq-e-biddat, Jamiat Ulama-i Hind general secretary Maulana Mahmood Madani Wednesday said that regardless of the court ruling, the practice of talaq, including instant triple talaq, will continue in the country and will be considered valid. ‚ÄúIf you want to punish the person for it, you can do so but the divorce will be recognised,‚Äù Madani told reporters. The Jamiat Ulama-i Hind was the respondent in a petition called the Muslim Women‚Äôs Quest for Equality which the court took suo motu cognizance of.

The Jamiat Ulama-i Hind made no bones of the fact that it viewed the court order as an interference in the fundamental right of practising one‚Äôs religion. ‚ÄúWe are viewing this very seriously. Not only do we not agree with the judgment, we think this is a direct assault on the fundamental right to practice religion. The repeated reference to nikaah, halala, polygamy etc have raised apprehensions that there may be more such interference on the anvil,‚Äù Madani said.

‚ÄúI want to state in unequivocal terms that talaq will continue to happen even though it is the worst sin in Islam, even instantaneous talaq will happen. If you want to punish the person, you can but the divorce will be deemed to have happened,‚Äù Madani said. He cited the example of owning a revolver licence. ‚ÄúDelhi Police has given it to me for self-defence, not to kill somebody,‚Äù he said, trying to explain why Islam incorporated the provision of talaq while deeming it halal.

He said the Jamiat had not yet decided on the next course of action. In a statement, the Jamiat said: ‚ÄúJuH appeals to all Muslims that they do not give triple talaq without any unavoidable circumstances because talaq is not the desirable thing in the eyes of the Shariat. Especially Muslims must avoid the practice of instant triple talaq so that others cannot find ways to interfere in our religious matters.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn view of the apprehensions arising‚Ä¶ Jamiat Ulama-i Hind seeks to make it clear that we will never compromise on religious rights guaranteed in the Constitution as fundamental ones. Any attempt to trample upon that should not be condoned. We will continue to fight against such an attempt at every level,‚Äù it said.

"Google Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL to launch on October 5: Report","Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will be launched with upcoming Snapdragon 836 processor on October 5, reveals a new report. (Image source :Evan Blass/Twitter) Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will be launched with upcoming Snapdragon 836 processor on October 5, reveals a new report. (Image source :Evan Blass/Twitter)

Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will be launched with upcoming Snapdragon 836 processor on October 5, revealed tipster Evan Blass in a tweet. ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs second-generation Pixel handsets, powered by Snapdragon 836 SoC‚Äôs, will be unveiled on October 5th,‚Äù the tweet read. Previous reports claimed that Google will announce its next-generation Pixel devices around the same time-frame when it unveiled Pixel, Pixel XL smartphones last year. Now Blass seems to have confirmed the launch date as October 5, though there‚Äôs no official confirmation.

As for the processor, Qualcomm is reportedly gearing up to launch its Snapdragon 836 as a minor upgrade to the existing Snapdragon 835 mobile platform. Snapdragon 836 is rumored be an Octa-core processor, with clock speeds of up to 2.5 GHz octa-core. The GPU will be clocked at 740 Mhz. To recall, Snapdragon 821, which offered 10 per cent performance increase over Snapdragon 820, was released last year in July.

Google Pixel 2 (codenamed ‚Äòwalleye‚Äô)will be manufactured by HTC, while the bigger Pixel XL 2 is said to be made by LG. Ahead of the launch, numerous leaks surrounding the device have surfaced online. Talking about Google Pixel 2, we‚Äôve seen conflicting reports on whether the smartphone will feature a bezel-less display or stick with a screen that will have prominent bezels.

Google Pixel 2 was earlier spotted in a FCC (Federal Communications Commission) filing and the document suggests that the upcoming phone will include HTC U11-like Edge Sensors and run Android Oreo. The Edge Sensors in the Pixel 2 will likely be called ‚ÄòActive Edge‚Äô and will reportedly launch Google Assistant on squeeze.

Blass has earlier tweeted out an image of the Pixel 2 as well. Going by the picture, Pixel 2 could feature thick bezels on top and bottom, and there won‚Äôt be a dual rear camera setup. Further, the Pixel 2 could have the same two-tone metal and glass back, like we saw in Google Pixel. Other features include 64GB ROM.

Google Pixel XL 2, which is codenamed ‚Äòtaimen‚Äô, is said to feature a 6-inch AMOLED display made by LG, with an aspect ratio of 2:1. According to a report in Android Police, the Pixel XL 2 could have also have the Active Edge feature and the same metal and glass design as seen on Google‚Äô previous-generation Pixel phones. Other expected features of Google Pixel Xl 2 include extremely thins bezels with a prominent 3D glass design, a 5.99-inch 1440p OLED display, 4GB RAM, and 128GB storage.

USISPF hails Donald Trump‚Äôs new South Asia policy,"US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

US President Donald Trump‚Äôs new South Asia policy is a ‚Äúdramatic shift‚Äù from America‚Äôs previous policy towards the region, a newly formed advocacy group said. In his policy address on Afghanistan and South Asia, Trump this week said the pillar of his new strategy was a change in America‚Äôs approach to Pakistan, considered a long- time ally of Washington.

‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs policy announcement on South Asia is a dramatic shift from the previous policy of the US towards South Asia,‚Äù Mukesh Aghi, president of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), said in a statement. The USISPF was established this summer by top corporate leaders in both countries, who are committed to creating a powerful strategic partnership between the US and India.

Among its board of directors include John Chambers from Cisco, Indra Nooyi from PepsiCo, Ajay Banga from MasterCard and former US ambassador to India Frank Wisner. USIISPF has hailed the South Asia policy announcement of Trump.

For the first time, the US has publicly acknowledged the importance of US-India partnership in the development of a secure and prosperous Afghanistan,‚Äù Aghi said. He said India has historically played a crucial role in balancing the geopolitical equation in South Asia and has been a reliable and trustworthy partner for the US.

India has been an important ally for Afghanistan especially in infrastructure development, health services and military equipment, however, India‚Äôs contribution had been decoupled from the US policy until now, he noted. ‚ÄúThis announcement corrects that anomaly. It will build trust and partnership between the two countries and usher in significant strategic and business impact,‚Äù Aghi said.

USISPF said that it is focused on driving economic growth, job creation, innovation, inclusion, and entrepreneurship in the US and India. It has a strong presence in the US and India, including in New York, Washington DC, Silicon Valley, Mumbai and New Delhi.

Supreme Court issues show cause notice to BCCI office bearers,"Committee of Administrators (CoA) have demanded current BCCI office bearers be removed. (Source: PTI) Committee of Administrators (CoA) have demanded current BCCI office bearers be removed. (Source: PTI)

Supreme Court has issued a show cause notice to BCCI office bearers secretary Amitabh Chaudhary, treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary and acting president CK Khanna while also issuing contempt notice to Amitabh for not implementing the Justice Lodha reforms. Amicus Curiae, Gopal Subramanian has told the three judge bench that BCCI hasn‚Äôt implemented anything from its July 24 order which pertains to implementation of the reforms. The matter has been deferred till September 19 when the court has asked the BCCI office bearers to appear in person.

The apex court has also directed that the Committee of Administrators ‚Äì appointed by the Court ‚Äì shall prepare a draft Constitution with respect to the order.

In its July 24 order, the Supreme Court had asked the BCCI to adopt the Lodha panel suggestions as far as ‚Äúpracticable‚Äù at its July 26 SGM. However, during the SGM, BCCI CEO Rahul Johri was not allowed to attend as BCCI office bearers claimed they wanted to allow only the board members ‚Äì something that was not appreciated by the CoA. The CoA chairman Vinod Rai has maintained that in the absence of a working committee, the onus of managing the BCCI affairs lies with the administrators and not the office bearers who are possibly trying to limit the role of Johri.

Transgender beauty pageant to be held in Gurugram,"Shortlisted transwomen from all over India will be competing for the Miss Transqueen India title this August. (Express Photo by Nirmal Harindran) Shortlisted transwomen from all over India will be competing for the Miss Transqueen India title this August. (Express Photo by Nirmal Harindran)

At the final event, 16 contestants from Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Karnataka and other states will compete to win the Miss Transqueen India title. ‚ÄúAuditions were held in Delhi, Mumbai and Manipur. I want to promote transgenders because some of them are my friends. I know how they feel,‚Äù pageant organiser Reena Rai, founder and chairperson of Suhani Dream Catchers, said. ‚ÄúIf this pageant will help them to be more confident, then I don‚Äôt see any harm in showing support to them,‚Äù she added. She has been working on the project since November last year.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get financial support from any big company as some said ‚ÄòIf we associate with the pageant, then it will affect the company‚Äôs image‚Äô. I have already put in Rs 10 lakh into it. But I don‚Äôt mind because I want to bring a change in the society,‚Äù said Rai, who has a hospitality background.

Like other beauty pageants, the contestants will have to go through swimming costume, traditional wear, evening gown and question-answer rounds. ‚ÄúMy contestants call me mom so I am not going to judge them,‚Äù she said.

Transgender social activist Gauri Sawant, former Mr Gay India Sushant Divgikar, fashion stylist Shaine Soni, educator and grooming expert Avleen Khokhar, nutrition and beauty expert Varun Katyal and Hector Ravinder Dutt, Principal of Delhi Public School Rohtak will be on the judging panel. ‚ÄúWe decided to have Hector because changes can only start from education,‚Äù said Rai.

Interestingly, the pageant doesn‚Äôt have an age bracket. ‚ÄúWe have a contestant Bunty Mehra. She is 55 years old. I want to send a message that if she can do it at this age, then others from her community can also do it. She is a make-up artist,‚Äù said the organiser. Others are mostly aged between 21 and 30.

Miss Transsexual Australia 2017 Laeticia Phylliscia Raveena will be crowning the first Miss Transqueen India. Though there is no prize money, the participants will get good exposure.

‚ÄúThe winner will go to Thailand for Miss International Queen, the first runner-up will compete at Miss Transsexual Australia. We are looking for another international pageant so that we can send the second runner-up too.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome of the people from the industry have also asked if they can walk as models for their shows,‚Äù she said. A Manipuri contestant, Loiloi Haorongbam, 23, hopes to win the title and represent India at Miss International Queen, Thailand, the way Manipuri Bishesh Huirem did last year.

‚ÄúBishesh went for the international contest on her own. She faced many difficulties just because she went all by herself. No one was there to help her,‚Äù said Haorongbam. ‚ÄúBy participating in this pageant here, I will get some experience first. I will be well groomed. And if I win a title here, my position at the international pageant might be better.‚Äù"
"After US destroyer collision, Chinese paper says US Navy a hazard","The Guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) is moored pier side at Changi naval base in Singapore following a collision with the merchant vessel Alnic MC Monday. (Source: AP) The Guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) is moored pier side at Changi naval base in Singapore following a collision with the merchant vessel Alnic MC Monday. (Source: AP)

The U.S. navy‚Äôs latest collision at sea, the fourth in its Pacific fleet this year, shows it is becoming an increasing risk to shipping in Asia despite its claims of helping to protect freedom of navigation, an official Chinese newspaper said. The USS John S. McCain and the tanker Alnic MC collided while the guided-missile vessel was nearing Singapore on Monday. The collision tore a hole in the warship‚Äôs port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area. Ten sailors are missing.

The collision ‚Äì the fourth major accident in the U.S. Pacific fleet this year ‚Äì prompted a fleet-wide investigation and plans for temporary halts in operations to focus on safety. The state-run China Daily said in an editorial on Tuesday that people will wonder why such a sophisticated navy keeps having these problems. ‚ÄúThe investigations into the latest collision will take time to reach their conclusions, but there is no denying the fact that the increased activities by U.S. warships in Asia-Pacific since Washington initiated its rebalancing to the region are making them a growing risk to commercial shipping,‚Äù it said.

China has been upset at U.S. freedom of navigation operations near Chinese controlled islands in the disputed South China Sea, where China has been reclaiming land, building air bases and increasing its military presence. ‚ÄúWhile the U.S. Navy is becoming a dangerous obstacle in Asian waters, China has been making joint efforts with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to draw up a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea and it has boosted navigational safety by constructing five lighthouses on its islands,‚Äù the China Daily said. ‚ÄúAnyone should be able to tell who is to blame for militarising the waters and posing a threat to navigation.‚Äù

"No US-Russia cyber unit without Trump notifying Congress, bill says","US President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg. (File Photo) US President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg. (File Photo)

US President Donald Trump would be required to notify U.S. lawmakers before creating a joint U.S.-Russia cyber security unit ‚Äì an idea that has drawn criticism across the political spectrum ‚Äì under legislation advancing in Congress. The proposal, if it became law, would be the latest in a series of maneuvers by Congress that either limit the president‚Äôs authority on Russia matters or rebuke his desire to warm relations with Moscow.

A provision contained within the annual Intelligence Authorization Act and passed by the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee 14-1 would require the Trump administration to provide Congress with a report describing what intelligence would be shared with Russia, any counterintelligence concerns and how those concerns would be addressed.

The bill, which grants congressional approval for clandestine operations carried out by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, passed the Senate Intelligence Committee in July, but its text was only recently made public because it involves sensitive intelligence operations.

Trump last month said on Twitter that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had discussed establishing ‚Äúan impenetrable Cyber Security unit‚Äù to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections.

Trump quickly backpedaled on the idea, which was criticized by Democrats, senior Republicans and the National Security Agency director.

The White House and Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the intelligence panel, were not immediately available for comment on the bill.

WARMER RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA

Trump wants to improve relations with Russia, a desire that has been hamstrung by the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Republican Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton. U.S. congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating the interference and possible collusion between Russia and members of Trump‚Äôs campaign. Moscow has denied any meddling and Trump has denied any collusion.

Previously, Congress tied the president‚Äôs hands on Russia by passing a bill that Trump cannot ease the sanctions against Russia unless he seeks congressional approval. In August, the Senate blocked Trump from being able to make recess appointments while lawmakers were on break, fearing the president would fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his handling of the Russian probe. Lawmakers have also introduced legislation to stop Trump from having the ability to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to determine whether there was collusion between Trump‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow.

The annual Intelligence Authorization Act requires approval by the full Senate and House and the president‚Äôs signature before it can become law. No vote has been scheduled and the last act was passed by Congress in March. The legislation‚Äôs provision requiring notification of any U.S.-Russia cybersecurity unit was pushed by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, his office said on Tuesday.

Wyden also helped secure provisions in the bill that call for an intelligence report assessing the threat posed to the United States by Russian money laundering and another report examining whether cyber vulnerabilities in U.S. cell networks, including a known bug in the global mobile network Signaling System No. 7, or SS7, are being exploited by foreign governments to conduct surveillance on Americans. Wyden was the lone committee vote against the bill, however. He said in a statement on Tuesday that he objected to language that identified the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks as a ‚Äúnon-state hostile intelligence service‚Äù because doing so could have implications for journalists.

Iran to be able to resume high-level uranium enrichment ‚Äòin 5 days‚Äô if US quits nuclear deal,"‚ÄúIf we make a determination, at most in five days we can start 20 per cent enrichment in Fordo (nuclear plant),‚Äù Ali Akbar Salehi said in an interview with state broadcaster IRIB.

(File ‚Äì AP Photo)

Iran can resume high-level uranium enrichment within five days if the United States tears up the nuclear deal, the head of its Atomic Energy Organisation said today. ‚ÄúIf we make a determination, at most in five days we can start 20 per cent enrichment in Fordo (nuclear plant),‚Äù Ali Akbar Salehi said in an interview with state broadcaster IRIB.

‚ÄúOf course we would not like such a thing to happen as we made a lot of effort to achieve the JCPOA (nuclear deal),‚Äù he added.

The 2015 nuclear deal with world powers saw sanctions eased in exchange for curbs to Iran‚Äôs nuclear programme. That included a ban on high-level enrichment of uranium of 20 per cent or more ‚Äì a process which would take Iran close to the level needed for a nuclear weapon.

US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to tear up the nuclear deal during his campaign, and it has come under mounting pressure after Tehran carried out missile tests and Washington imposed new sanctions ‚Äì with each accusing the other of violating the spirit of the agreement.

Centre to set up Alternative Mechanism for bank mergers,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley (Source: PTI Photo) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley (Source: PTI Photo)

To expedite public sector bank merger, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a framework for consolidation among PSBs, including a proposal to set up an Alternative Mechanism (AM) to create strong banks. ‚ÄúThe decision would facilitate consolidation among the Nationalised Banks to create strong and competitive banks,‚Äù the government said in a statement. As per the framework, mergers decisions should originate from the banks and these should be based on commercial decisions. The Alternative Mechanism will comprise of senior ministers of the government.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley said the AM will oversee the proposals coming from boards of public banks for consolidation and such a mechanism will enable quick facilitation. ‚ÄúYou have large number of banks in the public sector. The object is to create strong banks. Our experience of consolidation has been positive so far,‚Äù he said.

Finance ministry officials have earlier said that the government sees a scope merging another 3-4 banks, after the State Bank of India merged five of its associate banks with itself last year. ‚ÄúThe decision regarding creating strong and competitive banks would be solely based on commercial considerations,‚Äù Jaitley said.

‚ÄúThe proposals received from banks for in-principle approval to formulate schemes of amalgamation shall be placed before the Alternative Mechanism. After in-principle nod, the banks will take steps in accordance with law and Sebi‚Äôs requirements,‚Äù the government said in the statement. The final scheme will be notified by Central Government in consultation with the RBI, it said.

Consolidation will improve capacity of the banking system to absorb shocks, Jaitley said. ‚ÄúThe decision is expected to facilitate the creation of strong and competitive banks in public sector to meet the credit needs of a growing economy, absorb shocks and have the capacity to raise resources without depending unduly on the state exchequer,‚Äù the statement said.

Country‚Äôs largest lender State Bank of India last year completed the process of merging State Bank Of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank Of Hyderabad, State Bank Of Mysore, State Bank Of Patiala and State Bank Of Travancore and Bharatiya Mahila Bank with itself. In the next phase of consolidation, while a merger among relatively strong banks is likely, weak banks are expected to shrink in their size.

The government said in its statement on Wednesday that the idea of consolidation was first suggested in 1991 but gathered pace in 2016. ‚ÄúIn 1991, it was suggested that India should have fewer but stronger public sector banks. However, it was only in May 2016 that effective action to consolidate public sector banks began to be taken by announcing amalgamation of six banks into the State Bank of India. The merger was completed in record time, unlike earlier mergers of State Banks of Indore and Saurashtra,‚Äù the government said.

Mergers are expected to reduce the pressure on the government of providing capital to the banks. In 2015, Centre launched the Indradhanush programme, to infuse Rs 70,000 crore into public banks. The government estimates that public banks would require about Rs 1.8 lakh crore of capital. This year Centre will put in Rs 10,000 crore into public banks.

The RBI Governor Urjit Patel had said in April that the banking system in India could be better off if some public sector banks are consolidated so as to have fewer but healthier entities. Patel had also said that consolidation of banks could also entail sale of real estate where branches are redundant as well as offering voluntary retirement schemes to manage headcount and adding younger, digital-savvy personnel.

AFC Cup: Bengaluru FC have one foot in inter-zonal final,"Bengaluru FC Sunil Chettri and 4.25 SC North Korea players in action during the AFC cup Inter Zone Semifinal match at Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru on Wednesday. Bengaluru FC won the match by 3-0.

Bengaluru FC won the match by 3-0. (PTI Photo)

From playing on the snow-covered pitches in Baerum, Norway, a week ago to a water-logged surface in Bengaluru, it was quite a transition for Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. What eventually mattered for him, and Bengaluru FC, on a rain-soaked night that it was a clean-sheet. And at a half-way stage in their inter-zone semifinal of the AFC Cup, Bengaluru have a comfortable 3-0 lead over North Korean side April 25 Sports Club.

Apart from a couple of tricky saves, Sandhu did not have much to do in his first club match on Indian soil since 2013. Instead, it was the pace of Udanta Singh and grittiness on Sunil Chhetri that April 25 found tough to deal. Realising the threat these two posed, April 25 employed a defensive line-up even though Bengaluru had five debutants in their starting 11.

Chief coach Albert Roca started with his five new signings ‚Äî Sandhu, Rahul Bheke, Dimas Delgado, Erik Paartalu and Antonio Dovale. While they got accustomed to the new team, it was the old guards who delivered. Chhetri led the charge with a 32nd-minute strike before Udanta Singh and Lenny Rodrigues found the target in the 51st and 78th minutes to help Bengaluru register an emphatic win in the rain-hit match in front of the cheering home crowd at Sree Kanteerava Stadium. Heavy rains lashed the stadium an hour into the game and both the teams played under reduced visibility.

Chhetri broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute by converting a penalty kick after Udanta was brought down by the North Korean goalkeeper Ri Kang inside the area. Chhetri stepped up and sent his shot at the center, which beat Ri Kang, who dived to his right. Bengaluru scored their second goal through Udanta as the winger sprinted from the vacant right flank into the box and sent a superb left footer into the North Korean net. Lenny Rodrigues completed the route as he sent the ball past Kang who was blinded by the splash of water on his face. Chhetri broke away and ran almost 50 yards to cut in and deliver the cross from the left to Lenny who made no mistake.

April 25 also had their chance in 23rd minute as Ri Hyong Jin sent an accurate freekick but An Song Il‚Äôs header hit the crossbar and the ball rebounded back into play. They also missed an opportunity coming their way to reduce the margin in the 71st minute as Kwon Ch sent a grounded cross but An Il Bom could not connect it properly. Soon after the half-time break, April 25 got into their act, but the smartness of the Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saved the situation. Kim Yu Song had beaten three Bengaluru men and was going for a shot from an angle into the goal in the 49th minute but Sandhu denied him. Bengaluru FC will now travel to Pyongyang on September 13 for the second leg match.

Data privacy: Where is India when it comes to legislation?,"FILE- In this May 16, 2012 file photo, an operator helps an elderly woman scan her fingerprints as she enrolls for Aadhar, India‚Äôs unique identification project in Kolkata, India.

(AP Photo/Bikas Das, File)

Amid the Aadhaar and privacy hearings, the Centre had informed the court that it had formed an expert committee headed by retired Justice B N Srikrishna, to study issues relating to data protection in India and suggest a draft Data Protection Bill. The committee panel consists five experts in fields relating to data protection.

In the digital age, privacy has become an intensely discussed and debated topic. In India, we are seeing that with the ongoing Aadhaar case in the Supreme Court, a new public discourse has started around the issue of digital privacy, and where the law currently stands on this subject.

A nine-judge bench passed its ruling on Thursday in the Aadhaar-privacy matter making right to privacy a fundamental right under the Constitution of India. Here we explain what is data privacy and under what laws India regulates its technological laws.

What is data privacy and data protection?

A right to protect one‚Äôs data on online platforms constitutes data privacy. Such data could either be concerned with an individual, enterprise or even a government. Going by the definition of personal data laid down by the European Union‚Äôs data protection guidelines, ‚Äúinformation concerning an identified and identifiable natural person‚Äù covers the scope of personal data. Therefore, if we follow this definition, the personal information provided by individuals during biometrics would be included. But data put out through biometrics or for economic purposes remains at risk in India since no legislation has been chalked out to protect such personal data.

What are the data protection laws in India?

Data protection in India is governed by loosely constructed provisions of the Information Technology Amended Act, 2008 (ITAA) under Sections 43-A and 72A of the Act. Compensation for failure to protect data (Section 43-A) was introduced by way of an amendment in 2008, which states the liability of a body corporate to compensate in case of negligence in maintaining and securing the ‚Äúsensitive data.‚Äù However, the Act fails to define ‚Äúsensitive data‚Äù and states the same as ‚Äúpersonal information as may be prescribed by the Central government.‚Äù

Although three years later, IT Rules 2011 were issued by WIPO defining in detail the term ‚Äúsensitive data‚Äù and what it entails of. As the IT Rules issued have been poorly drafted, the applicability of the same has always been in question.

Breach of data privacy has also been mentioned under the ITAA and is punishable under Section 72-A (introduced by an amendment in 2008), which penalises the offender for a three year imprisonment or a maximum fine of Rs 5 lakh.

The effort to bring in a second legislation ‚Äî Personal Data Protection Bill ‚Äî governing data protection and privacy has been in the pipeline since 2006. Several amendments have been made to the Bill and the latest draft was introduced in Rajya Sabha in 2014. This bill provides a small definition of ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù and vaguely explains the role of a ‚ÄúData Controller.‚Äù Data controller has been defined as those people who view the complaints relating to processing, disclosing of personal data and claim for compensation. Unable to explain the duties and responsibilities of a data controller, the bill also fails to underline the issue relating to outsourced data and the liabilities of companies outsourcing and hosting the data.

The current legislation (ITAA) fails to mention the enterprises that store data and questions their liability in case of a breach and compensation to consumers.

How do the foreign data protection laws regulate data privacy?

European Union (EU): Distinct from all other major human rights documents, protection of people‚Äôs data has been included as one of the fundamental rights of the European Union under Article 8 of the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Right to privacy and consent of an individual form the basis of Article 8 adding the right to access data and the right to have it rectified.

EU superseded the Data Protection Directive with the General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 and the same Regulation will be enforceable from 2018. The Regulation will be applied to all 28 of the European Union members. Data processors will be held under the law which would include individuals as well as companies processing bulky data.

In order to remove obstacles from cross-border flow of data, the Directive states that privacy of people and freedom should be maintained at all levels by processing the data equivalent in all Member states.

The European Union Directive 95/46/EU, Data Protection Directive, lays down the liability of data breach on the data controller. According to the provision, any person who has been a subject to data breach is entitled to a compensation from the data controller.

Japan: After European Union, Japan introduced a separate central legislation for protection of data as the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). The Act took partial effect in 2016 and has been enforceable from May 30, 2017. The law defines the scope of the legislation and states on whom the law is applicable under Article 2-4 of the APPI. As per the Act, it is applicable to four entities- state institutions, local public bodies, independent administrative agencies and an entity not having over 5,000 individuals‚Äô personal information for more than six months. Similar to the EU law, consent of a data subject forms the essence of the legislation and has been stated as mandatory in case of transmitting data to a third party or for any use beyond communication purposes.

"Libyan civil war: ‚Äô11 beheaded in attack on checkpoint‚Äô, Islamic State claims responsiblity","IS claimed responsibility for the attack via its Amaq propaganda channel on the Telegram messaging app, saying its fighters had killed or wounded ‚Äú21 members of Haftar‚Äôs militia‚Äù (Representatuive Image) IS claimed responsibility for the attack via its Amaq propaganda channel on the Telegram messaging app, saying its fighters had killed or wounded ‚Äú21 members of Haftar‚Äôs militia‚Äù (Representatuive Image)

At least 11 people were beheaded today in an attack claimed by the Islamic State jihadist group on a checkpoint manned by forces of Libyan military strongman Khalifa Haftar. Haftar‚Äôs spokesman Colonel Ahmad al-Mesmari said ‚Äúat least nine soldiers were beheaded‚Ä¶ in addition to two civilians‚Äù when the jihadists attacked at dawn in the Al-Jufra region about 500 kilometres (300 miles) south of Tripoli.

IS claimed responsibility for the attack via its Amaq propaganda channel on the Telegram messaging app, saying its fighters had killed or wounded ‚Äú21 members of Haftar‚Äôs militia‚Äù. Libya has been rocked by chaos since the 2011 fall and killing of longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi in a NATO-backed revolution.

Jihadists, arms dealers and people traffickers have gained a foothold in the North African country as multiple authorities and dozens of militias vie for power. Forces allied with the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord drove IS jihadists from their stronghold of Sirte on the Mediterranean coast in December.

The GNA underlined at the time that the battle against Islamist rebels was not over, as armed groups continue to hunt down IS members who fled Sirte as the city fell. Analysts and military sources say the group remains active in Libya, particularly in the desert south where the GNA holds little sway.

Haftar, who backs a rival administration that refuses to recognise the GNA, controls much of the country‚Äôs vast southern desert. His self-proclaimed Libyan National Army in May seized Tamenhant base near the southern city of Sebha after driving out a pro-GNA militia. The following month, it seized Al-Jufra, including a key military air base, from the Benghazi Defence Brigades, a coalition that includes Islamists driven out of Libya‚Äôs second city by pro-Haftar forces.

That placed the strongman in control of all the major cities and military bases in southern Libya. Also in July, Haftar announced the ‚Äútotal liberation‚Äù of Benghazi, three years after his forces launched a military operation to seize the city.

But clashes have continued in the city, a bastion of the 2011 uprising that later fell to jihadists. Forces loyal to Haftar regularly blame attacks against them on IS, particularly in Benghazi.

Indian students biggest beneficiaries of Erasmus scholarship: EU ambassador,"Erasmus Mundus or Erasmus+ Masters scholarships have been offered to 5,300 Indian students from 2004 to 2017. Erasmus Mundus or Erasmus+ Masters scholarships have been offered to 5,300 Indian students from 2004 to 2017.

The European Union has announced on Wednesday that Indian students are the largest recipients of scholarships for higher education through European Region Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students (Erasmus).

‚ÄúSince 2004, Erasmus was thrown open to third countries. Indian students have been the number one beneficiaries of this scholarship,‚Äù said European Union ambassador to India Tomasz Kozlowski. Erasmus celebrated its 30-year anniversary on August 23, 2017, and the ambassador was present in New Delhi for the event where he commented that Europe was ‚Äúan excellent destination for international students‚Äù.

He said that Europe provides high-quality education in a wide variety of courses and that there is an added advantage of its proximity to Asia and richness of campus life.

Erasmus was launched in 1987 and had only 3,200 students in its first year. Since then, it has grown into a leading scholarship programme providing scholarships to over three lakh students annually. According to a statement by the EU delegation to India, Erasmus Mundus or Erasmus+ Masters scholarships have been offered to 5,300 Indian students from 2004 to 2017.

In 2016, about 62 Indian students had their scholarships approved for masters and doctoral degrees. This brought India to the second position among Erasmus beneficiaries, closely following Brazil which had 79 approved scholarships.

This year, the applicants rose by 20 per cent 74 students have had their scholarships approved. According to the statement, this represents ‚Äú25 per cent of the overall mobility flows selected for funding‚Äù from 2008 to 2012 in Asia. It added that female participation was 33 per cent in the period of 2008 to 2012 and this has increased to 43 per cent in 2017.

The statement also notes that 90 per cent of Indian recipients have returned, that among the most popularly pursued subjects engineering is the most popular at 25 per cent of the total scholarships. It further stated that students pursuing natural sciences comprised of 13 per cent of the beneficiaries while 10 per cent pursued business, economics and management.

Billy Payne retires as Augusta National chairman,"Billy Payne, the man who opened the doors of Augusta National to women members, announced on Wednesday he would retire as chairman of one of the world‚Äôs most exclusive golf clubs and home of the U.S. Masters.

Payne, who took over from Hootie Johnson in May 2006 and served as chairman for 11 years, will step down on Oct. 16.

He will be succeeded by Fred Ridley, who currently serves the Masters Tournament as Chairman of the Competition Committees.

Ridley will become the seventh chairman of Augusta National.

‚ÄúThe privilege I experienced serving as chairman of Augusta National and the Masters was far greater than I could have ever imagined,‚Äù Payne said in a statement.

‚ÄúJust as nothing can prepare you for the unique responsibilities and important decisions that come with this position, it is equally impossible to anticipate the many joys and, most importantly, the wonderful friendships that are the ultimate reward of service. ‚ÄúThis honor, however, is too great for one person to claim as their own for too long a period of time.

‚ÄúI retire knowing it is simply the right thing to do -‚Äì and at the right moment ‚Äì- to open the door and invite someone new to be called upon to lead, bring forth new ideas and craft a new vision that will honor our Founders and serve the game of golf for many years to come.‚Äù

Payne, who brought the 1996 Summer Olympics to Atlanta before taking over the job as Augusta National chairman, oversaw tremendous changes at what is perhaps the world‚Äôs most exclusive golf club but none more significant than welcoming women.

Johnson refused to relent under mounting pressure and protest to open Augusta National to women and the club remained an exclusive male domain until Payne opened the doors in 2012.

Augusta National does not discuss its membership but current women members include former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and businesswoman Darla Moore.

Lack of generosity from spouse drives women to be unfaithful: Survey,"As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue (Source: ThinkStock Images) As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue (Source: ThinkStock Images)

Once the wooing stage is over and the couple has settled down, some men become far less generous and downright stingy. This leads to most women becoming unfaithful to their partners, according to a survey. Gleeden, a European dating site for married individuals, catering to people seeking affairs outside their relationships, conducted a research on 5,000 Indian women users of the dating site who belong to the age group of 23-35 years.

According to the study, married women do not ask to be showered with gifts, but they do appreciate being looked after and valued. As many as 74 per cent of the women felt that their spouse was not generous enough, while 56 per cent said they have already fought about this issue.

Most women link infidelity to the lack of generosity from their husbands. Around 69 per cent women think that the lack of sweet words, tenderness, small gestures and initiatives is because their spouse is cheating on them or is in the process.

To explain their own infidelity as a result of their spouse‚Äôs ignorant behaviour, 39 per cent of the women members stated that it was their need to feel valued.

Around 29 per cent women admitted their self-esteem is hurt when their spouse does not make sufficient effort. Over a quarter of them declared that stinginess has suppressed their desire for their spouse, and that they consider this defect to be a real romance killer.

‚ÄúWe are delighted to see the increasing number of Indian users in our site and how encounters outside marriage is no more a taboo or something to be shy about in India.

Afghanistan hails Donald Trump for breaking silence on Pakistan‚Äôs support to terror,"Afghanistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US, Hamdullah Mohib said Trump has embraced a strategy that gives Afghanistan what it needs, specifically a shift away from talking about timetables and numbers to letting conditions on the ground determine military strategy. Afghanistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US, Hamdullah Mohib said Trump has embraced a strategy that gives Afghanistan what it needs, specifically a shift away from talking about timetables and numbers to letting conditions on the ground determine military strategy.

Afghanistan today lauded President Donald Trump for breaking America‚Äôs ‚Äúsilence‚Äù on Pakistan providing sanctuaries to terrorists and embracing a strategy that gives the war-torn country what it needs. Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to the nation as commander-in-chief, ruled out a hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to end America‚Äôs longest war.

He also warned Pakistan of consequences for providing safe havens to terrorists and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. Reacting to Trump‚Äôs address, Afghanistan‚Äôs Ambassador to the US Hamdullah Mohib thanked president Trump for breaking America‚Äôs silence on Pakistan, which has been harbouring terrorists for attacks against its neighbours. ‚ÄúWe welcome this decision, which is the result of intense deliberations and takes into account both our countries‚Äô needs and considerations. This is the first time a focus has been put on what Afghanistan must have to succeed, and we are grateful for this outcome,‚Äù Mohib said after Trump concluded his speech on Afghanistan and South Asia.

Mohib said Trump has embraced a strategy that gives Afghanistan what it needs, specifically a shift away from talking about timetables and numbers to letting conditions on the ground determine military strategy. He also lauded the decision to integrate America‚Äôs military, economic and political power to achieve shared goals.

The strategy also expands ‚Äúauthority to move swiftly against terrorist activities and criminal networks in place of micromanagement from Washington‚Äù and ‚Äúa breaking of the silence over Pakistan‚Äôs shelters and sanctuaries for terrorists‚Äù, the Afghan Ambassador said. ‚ÄúLike America, Afghanistan also wants an honourable and enduring outcome‚Äù to this fight, for all the Afghan, US, and NATO soldiers who have served and sacrificed to advance the cause of peace, Mohib said.

In his address, Trump slammed Pakistan for its continued support to terrorist groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so. ‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,‚Äù Trump said.

‚ÄúPakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists,‚Äù he said, in an apparent warning to Pakistan. In his speech, Trump came down heavily on Pakistan for its support to terror groups, saying Islamabad receives billions in aid from the US but continues to harbour terrorists.

‚ÄúIn the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner. Our militaries have worked together against common enemies. The Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism. We recognise those contributions and those sacrifices,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúBut Pakistan has also sheltered the same organisations that try every single day to kill our people,‚Äù he added.

Trump noted that the US has been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars but it continues to house the very terrorists that America is fighting.

‚ÄúBut that will have to change. That will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country‚Äôs harbouring of militants and terrorists who target US service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace,‚Äù Trump said.

Arun Jaitley seeks action against Arvind Kejriwal for ‚Äòblatant perjury‚Äô,"Underlining that as the CM, the onus was on Kejriwal to uphold the sanctity of the court, Jaitley‚Äôs plea said, ‚ÄúA blatant false and dishonest statement under oath by such a high functionary must attract severe and stringent punishment..‚Äù Underlining that as the CM, the onus was on Kejriwal to uphold the sanctity of the court, Jaitley‚Äôs plea said, ‚ÄúA blatant false and dishonest statement under oath by such a high functionary must attract severe and stringent punishment..‚Äù

Union Minister Arun Jaitley Wednesday filed an application in the Delhi High Court to take action as per law against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal ‚Äúfor making a false statement and filing a false affidavit‚Äù. According to the plea filed by Jaitley‚Äôs counsel Manik Dogra, Kejriwal had committed ‚Äúblatant perjury‚Äù to ‚Äúdefeat the end of justice‚Äù. It said that during cross-examination on May 17, senior advocate Ram Jethmalani had used offensive, abusive and per se defamatory words against Jaitley. He later said this was done on Kejriwal‚Äôs instructions.

Kejriwal, in a reply, denied giving any instructions. But Jethmalani subsequently gave interviews saying that during a conversation, Kejriwal had used even more objectionable words against Jaitley. He also said Kejriwal had instructed him to use the words.

Underlining that as the CM, the onus was on Kejriwal to uphold the sanctity of the court, Jaitley‚Äôs plea said, ‚ÄúA blatant false and dishonest statement under oath by such a high functionary must attract severe and stringent punishment‚Ä¶ Committing perjury before the court‚Ä¶ is squarely covered under provisions of Section 340 of the CrPC, 1973.‚Äù Hence, Kejriwal had to be punished as per law, the plea said.

Justice Manmohan has issued a notice to Kejriwal, to be returned within four weeks. The matter has been listed for further hearing on December 11.

(Source: File Photo) Being aware of one‚Äôs body type makes it easier to find clothes that look good. Following easy tips always helps in enhancing the apt look. (Source: File Photo)

Are you in a fix over what will suit your curves best? Go out and experiment, mixing and matching different styles, experts suggest.

Vidit Sehgal, Head ‚Äî Marketing and IT and Co-Founder of online shopping platform, especially for plus size women LURAP.com, and Bhavya Chawla, Chief Stylist at Voonik, list down ways women can accentuate their curves:

Embrace colours and patterns. You can wear stripes, polka dots, floral prints, and more. Loud prints bring emphasis to the areas they cover, so pay attention while making your selection. Choose clothes that not only best suit your look, but also feel comfortable on your skin.

Avoid oversized clothes. Instead, try well-fitted clothes that add to your beauty and positively highlight your beautiful curves.

Go for wide belts. Get a beautiful belt and pair it with a well-fitting flare dress. The wrap dress is also a great alternative to match with wide belts and will create the same flattering effect.

Show off a little with a crop jacket and a well-tailored one-piece paired with boots to look stylish. Crop tops with high-waist skirts showing off a little of your waist and hips also look attractive. Always go for A-line skirts.

Go for long necklaces and chunky bracelets for an unconventional look. Avoid wearing small necklaces, though.

Shapewears help you in accentuating all the right curves and are perfect for a firmer, shapelier you. Wear it over your long leg panties and look slimmer under a fitted dress.

Solid Hues. Ditch black and opt from any solid hues for amazingly flattering looks, they are equally slimming. Choose peplum, a streamlined pencil skirt with a peplum creates an hourglass shape.

Horizontal Stripes. Say yes to horizontal stripes and break up the pattern with a blazer or coloured pants.

Patterns. Bring in some fun to your wardrobe with patterns. For the ultimate slimming effect, look for patterns with darker backgrounds.

Big protests expected as Trump goes to Phoenix for rally,"FILE ‚Äì In this July 11, 2015 file photo, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks before a crowd of 3,500 Saturday, July 11, 2015, in Phoenix.

(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)

Large protests could greet President Donald Trump on Tuesday when he travels to Arizona for his first campaign rally since he caused an uproar with his remarks about a white nationalist demonstration in Virginia. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, asked the Republican president to postpone Tuesday‚Äôs event scheduled for 7 p.m. MST (0200 GMT on Wednesday) in light of his response to the street battles that broke out earlier this month at a protest against the removal of a Confederate statue in Charlottesville.

Trump was widely criticized for blaming both white nationalists and counter-protesters for the violence at the rally organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. ‚ÄúAmerica is hurting. And it is hurting largely because Trump has doused racial tensions with gasoline,‚Äù Stanton wrote in the Washington Post. ‚ÄúWith his planned visit to Phoenix on Tuesday, I fear the president may be looking to light a match.‚Äù Several anti-Trump demonstrations are planned for Phoenix, according to social media postings by local activists.

Some White House officials privately expressed concern on Monday about Trump‚Äôs Phoenix rally, fearing he might revisit the Charlottesville issue in the heat of the moment while cheered on by thousands of supporters. It will be Trump‚Äôs first trip as president to Arizona, which he won in the 2016 election. He will also visit a border protection facility in Yuma, Arizona, along the U.S.-Mexican border as he seeks congressional funding for the wall he wants built.. While in Yuma, Trump will view equipment used to secure the border and attend a briefing on border protection, the White House Department of Homeland Security officials told reporters on Tuesday that Yuma was an example of how adding barriers at the border could lower unlawful immigration. The area has seen an 82 percent decrease in illegal entries since 2007 after a fence was installed. Republican Governor Doug Ducey told the Arizona Republic on Monday that he would welcome Trump on the tarmac when he arrived but would not attend the campaign rally.

Trump has clashed with Arizona‚Äôs two Republican US senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, on various issues. Both lawmakers are critics of the president. Trump said earlier this month that he was considering pardoning Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff found guilty of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case.

Wayne Rooney taunts Manchester City fans after 200th Premier League goal,"Wayne Rooney scored the opener for Everton against Manchester City. (Source: Reuters) Wayne Rooney scored the opener for Everton against Manchester City. (Source: Reuters)

Wayne Rooney took a dig at Manchester City fans after scoring the opening goal of the night and his 200th in the Premier League on Monday night. But his goal for Everton wasn‚Äôt enough for the Toffees to get all three points against City at the Etihad Stadium. Despite getting just one point from the game, instead of a possible 3, Rooney had a sly go at the City fans who have seen him celebrate here in the red shirt of Manchester United.

The former England and Manchester United captain opened the deadlock in the 35th minute as he placed Dominic Calvert-Lewin‚Äôs cross beneath City goalkeeper Ederson. The striker ran away with his hands cupped to his hears in front of the City faithful prompting plenty of angry responses from the stands.

Later Rooney wrote on Twitter, ‚ÄúAlways nice to see a few familiar faces‚Äù alongside a picture of him celebrating,‚Äù with an image of clearly angry Manchester City fans hurling profanities at the striker.

A photograph later circulated showing Rooney celebrating a United goal at the Etihad Stadium and in front on the same section of supporters in 2012. Incidentally, there were a handful of City fans seated in the same seats as they were on Monday.

City drew level in the second with Raheem Sterling scoring in the 82nd minute. Everton let go of a big chance to get all three points with City reduced to ten men following the dismissal of Kyle Walker. But Everton were down to ten, too, after Morgan Schneiderlin was sent off.

Rooney even teased Manchester City after the match when, asked on Sky Sports, what it was like to score against the club for the ninth time, he replied: ‚ÄúWhat, again?‚Äù

"Shiv Sena starts shakha from metal container in Thane, NCP objects","Jitendra Awhad, local NCP legislator, has written to civic authorities, seeking action in the matter. Jitendra Awhad, local NCP legislator, has written to civic authorities, seeking action in the matter.

More than a year after the Thane municipality demolished a Shiv Sena shakha (branch office) in Kalwa, the Sena has now placed a metal container on the road and has started using it as the shakha. According to local Sena leaders, the container, painted in saffron and with the party flag atop, was installed recently at the same place and being used as the office of the local unit of the party.

They, however, added that there was no formal inauguration of the shakha. The Nationalist Congress Party has objected to the move and has complained to the Thane Municipal Corporation, demanding that the container be removed from the spot immediately.

In May last year, the civic body had demolished several structures for a road-widening project, including the Shiv Sena shakha at Kalwa Naka and local NCP legislator Jitendra Awhad‚Äôs party office. Local Sena leaders said they needed some structure to run the shakha from.

‚ÄúFor the past one year, we have been running our operations from under a tree on the road. With the arrival of monsoon, we needed a roof to carry out our daily social work. So, we have put up a container at the junction to run the shakha,‚Äù said Vijay Shinde, Sena‚Äôs Kalwa Vibhag Pramukh. ‚ÄúWe will remove it once the civic body provides us alternative accommodation,‚Äù he added.

He further claimed that the shakha office was set up around five decades ago. ‚ÄúA temporary structure was set up in 1968 to start a shakha office, which was inaugurated by late Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray. A few years later, a pucca structure was built and has been there since,‚Äù added Shinde.

Stating that local Sainiks were against the demolition, Shinde said the demolition happened after Sena minister Eknath Shinde requested Sainiks to cooperate with the civic body. ‚ÄúIf we had not allowed the demolition, then Sena would have been blamed for obstructing development work. The minister convinced us and all of us agreed,‚Äù he said.

Another Sena leader said the structure was demolished due to the failure of previous Sena leaders in filing an affidavit in court. ‚ÄúWe have all documents since the beginning. We have paid all property taxes. Had we filed an affidavit, the structure would have been regularised,‚Äù said a leader.

Jitendra Awhad, local NCP legislator, has written to civic authorities, seeking action in the matter. ‚ÄúThe Sena had built some walls after the structure was demolished in May. Then, it was demolished again following the High Court orders. Now, the party has placed a container on the road. The Sena is openly violating all the laws. Despite the complaints, the civic body is not taking any action against it,‚Äù said Awhad. Despite the repeated attempts, civic officials were not available for comment.

The Urdu Press: Board‚Äôs shortcoming,"Hamara Samaaj too, in its editorial on August 23, has avoided making any direct comment on the judgement as such, summarising mainly the various factors surrounding this issue and the process in the Supreme Court. Hamara Samaaj too, in its editorial on August 23, has avoided making any direct comment on the judgement as such, summarising mainly the various factors surrounding this issue and the process in the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court of India‚Äôs decision on the matter talaq-e-bidat or triple talaq in one sitting, a controversial aspect of Muslim personal law, was discussed across the Urdu press.

Board‚Äôs Shortcoming

Commenting on the verdict of the Supreme Court about practice of Triple Talaq being ‚Äúarbitrary‚Äù and ‚Äúillegal‚Äù, Rashtriya Sahara, in its editorial on August 23, writes: ‚ÄúThis judgment of the Supreme Court is being applauded, and rightly so, from by sides (the government, the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, the Congress, the BJP, the All-India Shia Personal Law Board and the Muslim Women‚Äôs Personal Law Board)‚Ä¶ What should have been done by the Muslim community itself has been done by the Supreme Court. It has been the stand of Muslims that personal law is a law of Shariat, and there is no scope of any change in it. But due to the lack of adequate knowledge about Shariat among a majority of Muslims in the country, conditions have been created in society that give others the opportunity to criticise Islamic teachings. Triple talaq has been one such issue.

The Muslim Personal Law Board did not take this matter as seriously as it should have, thus sidetracking the wider interests of the community and yielding to certain exigencies of the present situation‚Ä¶ Instead of launching campaigns to explain the spirit of the Shariat and highlighting the positive aspects of the ways and means of divorce it promotes, rather than the practice of triple talaq, a regular flow of statements in the name of interference in the Shariat was exploited by others and an atmosphere of misunderstanding of religious traditions and the Shariat was created among Muslim women in the country.‚Äù

Careful analysis

Avoiding an expression of its views on the Supreme Cou‚Äôt‚Äôs judgment, Hindustan Express, in its editorial on the same day, has remarked that ‚Äúfollowing this judgement, the BJP is trying to emerge as the greatest sympathiser of Muslim women and expressing its pleasure at its effort to save Muslim women from the sword of triple talaq hanging over them.‚Äù Hamara Samaaj too, in its editorial on August 23, has avoided making any direct comment on the judgement as such, summarising mainly the various factors surrounding this issue and the process in the Supreme Court.

Personal law intact

Inquilab, in its editorial, also on August 23, writes, ‚ÄúUndoubtedly, this judgment of the Supreme Court will be a hurdle before the undesirable trend and unhealthy tradition of triple talaq, something to which Islam has expressed its aversion‚Ä¶The court has not said anything about talaq (divorce) in general and only held as illegal the three talaqs that are pronounced in one sitting. This responsible stance of the Supreme Court should be applauded‚Ä¶ Reading between the lines, it is clear the court has accepted the status of Muslim Personal Law and has declined to interfere with it.‚Äù

England bring in Chris Woakes for Toby Roland-Jones for second Test,"Chris Woakes will play his first game of the series. (Source: Reuters) Chris Woakes will play his first game of the series. (Source: Reuters)

England comfortably won the first Test against West Indies at Edgbaston last week but they will change their playing XI for the second Test at Headingley on Friday. Captain Joe Root confirmed that fast bowler Chris Woakes will return to the side and will replace Toby Roland-Jones.

‚ÄúChris is back in and Toby misses out, unfortunately,‚Äù Root told Sky Sports News.

Woakes has been out of the England team since June when he suffered a side strain against England‚Äôs opener against Bangladesh in Champions Trophy. He was ruled out of the tournament. He later missed the four-match Test series against South Africa which was won 2-1 by England.

The 28-year-old pacer will now return to the side after being out of action for close to three months. He missed the first Test against West Indies due to the same problem.

Root‚Äôs also said that it won‚Äôt be an easy Test despite his team‚Äôs thumping win in the first Test. The captain added that West Indies will look to bounce back.

‚ÄúWest Indies will be desperate to bounce back,‚Äù added Root who will like to his team to continue their form.

England won the first Test, a Day-Night pink ball Test against West Indies, by an inning and 209 runs. This was the first ever first pink ball Test in England.

England lead the three-match Test series 1-0 and will look to continue their winning form at home.

"Small step, no giant leap","Muslim women celebrating Supreme Court‚Äôs verdict on triple talaq. (Express photo by Vishal) Muslim women celebrating Supreme Court‚Äôs verdict on triple talaq. (Express photo by Vishal)

It was widely expected that the Supreme Court would invalidate the practice of triple talaq. The moral and constitutional arguments for doing so were overwhelming. The Supreme Court has done well in striking it down. The only question was the grounds the Court would invoke in doing so, and the ramifications this might have for wider developments on the issue of personal law. On this measure, it has to be said the Court‚Äôs decision is disappointing. It reflects the fact that India is still not ready to embrace the full promise of individual freedom and equality embodied in its Constitution; they will have to be won in bits and scraps, hesitantly and amelioratively.

For starters, the decision was very narrow. The fact that it is a 3:2 decision should be a reminder of just how far we are from creating a consensus that principles of equality and freedom should be the touchstone of our Constitution, and all religious and customary practices must measure up to it. Although the Court has invalidated triple talaq it is worth reminding ourselves that the majority has not ruled that our basic constitutional values override religious belief and practice.

In fact, Justices Nazeer and Khehar‚Äôs dissenting decision is the strongest defence we have seen of community rights over individual rights, religion over liberty and equality, and private law over statutory enactment for decades. In fact, it goes one step further. By equating practices like personal law with Article 25(1), with freedom of conscience, it lays the basis for an even stronger defence of personal law than is currently the case. In addition, Justice Kurian Joseph invalidated the practice on the very narrow ground that triple talaq was incompatible with the tenets of Islam. This case is a small step for justice, but not a giant leap for Indian constitutional law. The nefarious judgment, State of Bombay v/s Narasu Appa Mali that exempts personal law from scrutiny still remains an operative judgment.

This may have some bearing on future jurisprudence. The key judgment by Justices Nariman and Lalit is perfunctorily argued, as if it lacks the courage of its own conviction. It correctly argued that the 1937 Shariat Act has the force of law behind it and is state action. It rightly emphasises the importance of Articles 14 and 21 and the intimate connections between them. Its potential radicalness consists in the fact that it avoids the disingenuous essential practices test. It says with clarity that whether or not a practice is essential for a religion is not within the competence of the Supreme Court to decide. And that it is neither here nor there if a practice violates the Constitution. But in triple talaq it is stunningly easy to show that Article 14 has been violated. This case may not, therefore, set any kind of precedence for other cases where the issue of gender equality is more debatable. In short, at least a more elaborate consideration of how Article 14 might affect personal laws would have laid down a better signpost for the future.

I disagree with all of Khehar and Nazeer‚Äôs conclusions. It is a seriously argued judgment. But the normative picture it presents of the Indian Constitution is frightening, since it leaves no recourse for individuals to have their dignity and equality affirmed; it puts them entirely at the mercy of their communities. It is chilling to read a sentence like, ‚ÄúIt is not open to a Court to accept an egalitarian approach over a practice which constitutes an integral part of a religion.‚Äù This, even when these practices have the imprimatur of state power behind them. It elevates faith to an un-negotiable status. I suspect this doctrine will have more implications than the judgment by Nariman and Lalit.

There is, unlike in Shah Bano, an admirable lack of grandstanding in this judgment. It is closer in tone to Danial Latifi v/s Union of India. It could be argued that the Court has done a very Indian thing. It reached the right conclusion without a consensus on first principles. It could also be argued that this is a prudent outcome. It produces a small reform, without creating a polarising debate on the question of personal law.

These are perhaps admirable outcomes. It is arguably through such a modus vivendi that Indian courts have retained their legitimacy. But let us not disguise the fact that 70 years after Independence, these victories are very small victories indeed. The cause of gender justice within the framework of personal laws and the Constitution still has a very long way to go. Our sheer relief at the fact that we do not have to confront hard political issues should not blind us to the cost of avoiding hard questions.

At the very least, we should recognise the fact that the courts have to tread so gingerly because we are not ready. The court‚Äôs caution reflects a fundamental conservatism in the republic. Then there is the question of Parliament‚Äôs role. This is a thorny issue our politics has avoided. Parliament, historically, has refrained from legislating on Muslim personal law, in part because it did not want to give the impression of majoritarian intimidation; and it did not feel it was as representative on these matters in relation to Muslims as it did to others. The net result was that personal law remained exempt from the burdens of justification, enforced by an obdurate Muslim Personal Law Board. This abdication was, in some senses, the political basis for the rise of majoritarianism.

Whatever change happened, happened incrementally, through the courts with politicians avoiding the issue. The abdication of the Congress and progressive forces on this issue was a colossal historical and moral blunder. The big question is: Is it now possible for our politics to calmly discuss issues of personal law reform and gender justice across all communities, without communalising our politics? The silver lining in this moment is the fact that there is such a strong movement for reform among Muslims.

This is reflected in the petitioners, but also the Muslim Women‚Äôs Personal Law Board that has challenged orthodoxy very impressively. For Parliament not to take up this debate, for progressives to unwittingly side with communal forces by shielding all personal law from the shining light of Articles 14 and 21, would be to let down these forces bubbling up within Indian society. The Court has given us a small victory. But it cannot bear the entire burden of reform or of forging a consensus. That is really the heart of its message.

Expelled Congress MLA to join BJP today: ‚ÄòCongress not acting against those involved in anti-party activities‚Äô,"Jadeja was expelled from Congress for cross voting in RS polls. Jadeja was expelled from Congress for cross voting in RS polls.

A day before joining the BJP, expelled Congress MLA Dharmendrasinh Jadeja on Tuesday alleged that the Congress was not acting against anti-party activities and there were people within the party who were working for the BJP in his constituency Jamnagar (North). Jadeja, who was one of eight Congress MLAs expelled for cross voting in the recent Rajya Sabha elections, said that the office bearers of the Congress didn‚Äôt listen to his complaints.

‚ÄúThe Congress leaders did not pay heed to my pleas to act on those working against the party. There were people within Congress who were actually working for the BJP in my constituency,‚Äù the 44-year-old first time MLA told The Indian Express.

Jadeja will join the BJP in presence of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani at an event in Jamnagar city, which he has organised. Minister of State for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja will also be present at the event.

Asked what kind of political future he sees with the BJP, Jadeja said a ticket to contest the upcoming Assembly election was not a precondition of him joining the party. ‚ÄúIf the party fields me, I shall contest, if it doesn‚Äôt, I think I shall be able to serve the people even then.‚Äù

A native of Khambhaliya taluka in Devbhoomi Dwarka district, Jadeja had joined the Congress around 20 years ago and risen through the party ranks to earn a ticket in the 2012 election. In his maiden Assembly election, he defeated BJP heavyweight Mulu Bera by around 10,000 votes.

When asked if the people of his constituency will accept his change of party allegiance, Jadeja said he was confident that they were still with him. ‚ÄúAn election is (like a) wrestling match‚Ä¶ The public is supreme. I am a politician who believes in drawing his line longer than truncating others‚Äô. Therefore, I never attacked the BJP but focused on serving the people. Before choosing the BJP, I spent a month meeting the people and they were positive. I have organised Wednesday‚Äôs event in my personal capacity. The turnout at the event will make the picture clearer,‚Äù said Jadeja who also owns Raviraj Infraproject Pvt Limited along with his wife Prafulaba. In his affidavit filed during the 2012 Assembly elections, Jadeja had declared assets worth around Rs12 crore.

Sources claimed that a few Congress corporators of Jamnagar Municipal Corporation were also likely to join the BJP along with Jadeja on Wednesday.

Local BJP leaders welcomed the development. ‚ÄúBJP would have defeated Jadeja had he contested the next Assembly elections as a Congress candidate. Now that he is joining the BJP, party leaders will decide who shall contest from this seat,‚Äù said Hasmukh Hindocha, president of Jamnagar city unit of the BJP.

President of Jamnagar city unit of Congress P C Khetiya said electors of this constituency have been loyal to the party. ‚ÄúJadeja‚Äôs 2012 win was a victory of the Congress and not an individual,‚Äù he said.

Trump administration wants to engage India more effectively in Afghanistan: Mike Pence,"US Vice President Mike Pence. (Reuters photo) US Vice President Mike Pence. (Reuters photo)

The Trump administration wants to engage India more effectively in Afghanistan and hold Pakistan accountable for its actions in the region, US Vice President Mike Pence said. His comments came hours after President Donald Trump hit out at Pakistan for providing safe havens to ‚Äúagents of chaos‚Äù that kill Americans in Afghanistan and warned Islamabad that it has ‚Äúmuch to lose‚Äù by harbouring terrorists.

‚ÄúWe want to strengthen the partnership between Afghanistan and India. We want to hold Pakistan more accountable for their actions in the region,‚Äù Pence said. ‚ÄúWhat President Trump announced yesterday was a whole new strategy for South Asia that said, look, we‚Äôre going to provide the resources and the military personnel and the air assets necessary to support the Afghan army‚Äôs efforts to defeat the Taliban,‚Äù the Vice-President told Fox News.

He said the US would destroy terrorist networks that use Afghanistan and portions of Pakistan as safe havens and asked Islamabad to step up and be a more effective partner in confronting the terrorist organizations, some 20 of which harbor in Afghanistan and regions in Pakistan.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to engage India more effectively in Afghanistan,‚Äù Pence said. India has been supporting an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned, broad-based and inclusive process of peace and reconciliation, and advocating the need for a sustained and long-term commitment to Afghanistan by the international community. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll let the Afghan people build their own nation. Our objective there is to advance the security of the United States of America and to support the Afghan national army as they stay in the lead, in the fight,‚Äù said the Vice President.

In an op-ed in USA Today, Pence alleged that Pakistan too often turns a blind eye to the cancer of terrorism and in many cases it has contributed to the growth of terrorist groups. ‚ÄúPakistan, like Afghanistan, is a haven for terrorist activity. Between the two countries, no fewer than 20 US- designated foreign terrorist organizations have haven and conduct operations ‚Äî the highest concentration of any region in the world. Pakistan, which has borne the weight of terrorist attacks in the past, shares with us,‚Äù he wrote.

He said America will not write a blank check for countries that fail to root out the same forces who try every day to kill its people. Pence said that Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with American effort in Afghanistan. It has much more to lose by supporting terrorists, he warned.

‚ÄúThe president has put them on notice,‚Äù he said. Pence said President‚Äôs strategy for South Asia involves a stronger strategic partnership with India ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest democracy and a key security and economic partner. ‚ÄúIndia has made important contributions towards Afghanistan‚Äôs stability and security, and India has also pledged critical support to Afghanistan‚Äôs development needs. Because they directly affect America‚Äôs interests, America will continue to work closely with New Delhi on these issues,‚Äù Pence wrote.

Dark Eden,"Title: Swarga Author: Ambikasuthan mangad

Publication: Juggernaut

256 pages

Swarga is an ambitious attempt to fictionalise an ecocide that has been unravelling in Kasaragode district in Kerala for many years. Thousands of people, particularly children, have been afflicted by a host of debilitating diseases, that are blamed on the aerial spraying of Endosulphan, a pesticide, in cashew plantations ringing the Kasaragode ghats. The public debates triggered by the tragedy has raised fundamental questions about modern agricultural practices and the responsibility of public institutions towards citizens. Endosulphan spraying was banned in 2000 and reports from the region point to the regeneration of local flora and fauna that had disappeared when pesticide use was rampant in large government-plantations.

Swarga, first published to much acclaim in Malayalam as Enmakaje in 2009, tells the story of the villagers of Swarga, Enmakaje and many other such hamlets who fought the PCK, which meant the state itself. The novelist, Ambikasuthan Mangad, however, has sought to turn what could have been a dry, grim catalogue of data and protests into an epic about modern man‚Äôs search for meaning in a technology-mediated world of consumption.

His narrators are a couple who, disgusted with urban life, have taken refuge in the forests of the Jadadhari hill in the shadow of which lies Swarga. Mangad calls them the Man and the Woman, since the two had decided to strip themselves of their past, identities and memories, when they left the city to retire to the jungle. Their attempt to reject an anthropomorphic worldview and journey back to a life in nature almost becomes a parable of the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, retracing the steps back to the Garden of Eden. When the woman ‚Äî her name, we are told later, is Devayani ‚Äî returns home with an orphan, the Man revolts. However, the baby, who turns out to be a stunted child, exposes them to the world beyond their Eden.

It is a world of a people, whose ancestors had sinned against nature and built a society of exploitation. The couple joins the struggle launched by a visiting activist, a local doctor and a journalist to bring justice to the people. The novel ends with a manipulative politician attacked by a golden serpent, who had worked against the interests of the people, and the couple, Devayani and Neelakantan, finding their awakening in a cave in the Jadadhari hill.

The patches, where Mangad tries to sketch a life for the couple in the city, jars the narrative. Blame it on the activist self of Mangad, parts of the novel assume a didactic tone which disturbs the philosphical armature he seeks for the subject. These anomalies, however, do not detract from the novel‚Äôs importance as flagging a seminal issue of our time: How best do we build our lives without violating the basic tenets of life itself.

"My role is to score hundreds, says Tom Westley","England‚Äôs Tom Westley knows he has to perform well in the England middle-order. (Source: Reuters) England‚Äôs Tom Westley knows he has to perform well in the England middle-order. (Source: Reuters)

England batsman Tom Westley has had a decent outing in the limited opportunities that he has had so far. Tom Westley‚Äôs performance in the middle order drew admiration and applause from former cricketers, as ex-England captain, Nasser Hussain even went on to compare him with Michael Vaughan. In a recent interview, Westley spoke about he has figured out his role in the side and intends to score big hundreds for his side.

Speaking to espncricinfo, Westley said, ‚ÄúI score consistently through the leg side so that‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm too concerned about. That‚Äôs the way I play. But I just thinking making that step up, and Cooky and Rooty showed it in the last game, that‚Äôs when you get in you have to make it count. I‚Äôve got a start in a few of my innings and that‚Äôs the difference between county cricket, where you can get to 30 or 60 and hope a score comes along, but in Test cricket the scrutiny is on you because you have to go on there and then.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my role to score hundreds. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm there to do at three and make match-winning contributions but I‚Äôm confident in my ability and my game plan. It‚Äôs worked for me for a number of years at Essex and hopefully, I can implement it at Test level.‚Äù

‚ÄúI spoke to Fletch yesterday. I speak to him a lot. It‚Äôs the same advice. Keep it simple. Try to implement what you‚Äôve done at Essex. I spoke to him briefly yesterday about a few things I try to tick off. I‚Äôve done it from a young age. For instance a big thing for me is my balance so I was disappointed to be lbw in the last game because the leg side is a massive strength of mine and it was disappointing to get out that way. I may get out lb several times a year but generally I score a large volume of runs through the leg side. Everybody has their check list before a Test and a big thing for me is my balance. Then everything takes care of itself.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen it first hand with other people at Essex and with Cooky, there is not point competing with him, he is the leading run-scorer for England of all time, so it was more important that they laid a platform for England to win and that is what happened. If I play this next game and get a good start and kick on then my time will come as it will for other players in the changing room. That is my philosophy.‚Äù

Skin care regime for new mothers,"It is very important for new mothers to take care of their skin after pregnancy (Source: File Photo) It is very important for new mothers to take care of their skin after pregnancy (Source: File Photo)

During and after pregnancy, every part of your body needs extra care and attention. Hormonal changes, stretched skin and sweat can sometimes trigger painful skin conditions that may cause discomfort and irritation. Experts suggest these are managed right from the time they appear.

Subhashini N.S., Natural Product Innovations, Research and Development, The Himalaya Drug Company and Hema Divakar, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, share a few common conditions and tips to help keep skin hydrated and moisturised:

Some of the common conditions you may experience during and after pregnancy are acne, rashes, stretch marks and dry skin. It is important to care of them.

* Choose a mild yet effective body butter which has ingredients like cocoa butter, a natural antioxidant that soothes, hydrates and balances the skin.

* Choose a moisturiser with invigorating fragrances of rose, lavender, or jasmine that help relax the mind.

* Body butter helps to replenish and moisturise the skin more effectively than lotions, keeping the skin hydrated for longer.

* Avoid wearing synthetic and rough materials that cause rash and irritation on the skin.

* Avoid using strong soaps, instead use mild, moisturising soap which prevents the post bath dryness.

* During the initial days of breastfeeding, you may experience sore and cracked nipples. Use products with natural ingredients that are especially enriched with virgin coconut oil that helps protect the skin from cracks and fissures.

* Massage your skin daily with oil that is enriched with sesame oil, known for its skin firming properties.

* Destructive winds, waves batter Hong Kong

* Financial markets, schools, businesses closed

* A total of 420 flights cancelled

* Worst storm in five years

Typhoon Hato, a maximum category 10 storm, slammed into Hong Kong on Wednesday lashing the Asian financial hub with destructive winds and waves which uprooted trees, flooded streets and forced most businesses to close.

More than 400 flights were cancelled, financial markets suspended and schools closed as Hato bore down on the city, the first category 10 storm to hit Hong Kong since typhoon Vicente in 2012.

Many skyscrapers in the heart of the financial centre were empty and in darkness as the city‚Äôs workers stayed at home and hunkered through the storm. Hato churned up Hong Kong‚Äôs iconic Victoria Harbour and triggered large swells and massive waves on some of the city‚Äôs most popular beaches, with serious flooding in low-lying areas.

In residential districts like Heng Fa Chuen on densely populated Hong Kong island, massive waves smashed against the sides of oceanfront buildings and surged over a promenade, swamping vehicles parked nearby.

Construction cranes swayed precipitously from the tops of skyscrapers, trees toppled and residents deployed canoes to get around on some streets.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen one like this,‚Äù said Garrett Quigley, a longtime resident of Lantau island to the west of the city. ‚ÄúCars are half submerged and roads are impassable with flooding and huge trees down. It‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Maximum winds near Hato‚Äôs centre were recorded at a destructive 155 kmh (95 mph).

A senior scientific officer for the Hong Kong observatory said sea levels could rise up to five metres (15 feet) in some places, with the government issuing flood alerts and opening 27 temporary shelters across the city.

Winds intensified in the morning, with the maximum sustained winds recorded at Tate‚Äôs Cairn and Waglan Island at 77 kmh (48 mph) and 72 kmh (48 mph), with maximum gusts of 103 kmh (64 mph) and 86 kmh (53 mph) respectively.

Trading in Hong Kong‚Äôs financial markets was halted for the day, the stock exchange said. Typhoon Nida in August last year was the last storm to close the exchange for the whole day.

A total of 420 airline flights to and from Hong Kong had been cancelled, said the government.

The city‚Äôs flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, said the storm would ‚Äúseverely‚Äù impact flight operations, with the majority of flights to and from Hong Kong between 2200 GMT Tuesday and 0900 GMT Wednesday to be cancelled.

Hong Kong Airlines also suspended most of its flights on Wednesday up until 0900 GMT.

Other transport services, including ferries to the gaming hub of Macau and outlying islands in Hong Kong, were suspended.

White House to give guidance on Trump transgender military ban: Report,"President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration is set to deliver the Pentagon guidance in coming days on how to implement his ban on transgender people serving in the military, The Wall Street Journal has said. Trump last month deployed a series of tweets that upended an Obama-era policy of more than a year allowing transgender troops to serve openly, an announcement that came with little apparent coordination with the Pentagon.

The two-and-a-half page White House memo would let Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ‚Äúconsider a service member‚Äôs ability to deploy in deciding whether to kick them out of the military,‚Äù the WSJ said yesterday. Citing US officials familiar with the memo, the paper said the guidance instructs the Pentagon not to admit new transgender people and to end payments for medical treatment regimens for members already serving.

Since Trump‚Äôs declaration several senior military officials have voiced unease over the policy shift, with the head of the Coast Guard saying he would not ‚Äúbreak faith‚Äù with transgender personnel.

He said there were 13 Coast Guard members who have come out as transgender, noting ‚Äúall of them are doing meaningful Coast Guard work today.‚Äù

A day after the president‚Äôs bombshell announcement, General Joe Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sent a short memo to senior officers and enlisted leaders that the current policy should remain in effect until Trump gives formal direction to the Pentagon and Mattis issues new guidance.

‚ÄúIn the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,‚Äù Dunford wrote.

General Mark Milley, Chief of Staff of the Army, had said he first learned of the change on the news.

‚ÄúWe will work through the implementation guidance when we get it, and then we will move from there,‚Äù Milley said.

Five transgender women in the US military are suing Trump and the Pentagon over the announcement, saying they face uncertainty about their futures, including whether they would be fired or lose post-military and retirement benefits.

Trump has said he did the Pentagon a ‚Äúgreat favor‚Äù by banning transgender troops, saying the issue had been ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù and ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù for the military.

The number of transgender troops among America‚Äôs 1.3 million active duty service members is small, with estimates ranging from between 1,320 and 15,000.

A guilty verdict for Thailand‚Äôs Yingluck may stoke anger but military firmly in charge,"Opposition activists said a guilty verdict would fuel anti-government anger and could spark a smattering of small protests in defiance of a government ban, particularly in the north and northeast where support for the Shinawatras appears unwavering. Opposition activists said a guilty verdict would fuel anti-government anger and could spark a smattering of small protests in defiance of a government ban, particularly in the north and northeast where support for the Shinawatras appears unwavering.

A long-awaited verdict in the trial of former Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra this week could inflame tension and would likely have far-reaching implications in the politically divided kingdom.

The ruling military said more than 3,000 of Yingluck‚Äôs supporters could show up at the court on Friday in what would be one of the biggest political gatherings since Yingluck‚Äôs government was ousted in a 2014 coup.

Thousands of policemen will be on hand in a bid to head off the sort of trouble that has become a hallmark of antagonistic Thai politics over the past decade or more.

Yingluck has been accused of negligence in her handling of a multi-billion dollar rice subsidy scheme, under which the government bought rice from farmers at inflated prices.

That led to stockpiles of rotting grain, distorted world prices and lost Thailand its crown as the world‚Äôs top exporter. Losses amounted to $8 billion, this government says.

Critics said the scheme was engineered by Yingluck‚Äôs brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, to shore up support among rural voters who have handed electoral victory to a Shinawatra party in every election since 2001.

Yingluck has denied wrongdoing and has said she is the victim of political persecution. She faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of negligence.

A military-backed legislature found her guilty in a separate impeachment case in 2015, and banned her from politics for five years, for failing to exercise sufficient oversight of the subsidy scheme.

Despite that, Yingluck remains the unofficial face of the Shinawatra political machine, which, supporters say, the royalist-military establishment is determined to sideline once and for all.

Opposition activists said a guilty verdict would fuel anti-government anger and could spark a smattering of small protests in defiance of a government ban, particularly in the north and northeast where support for the Shinawatras appears unwavering.

‚ÄúIf she is found guilty there will surely be some action by underground resistance forces,‚Äù said a leader of the pro-Shinawatra ‚Äúred shirt‚Äù movement in the northeastern city of Khon Kaen who declined to be identified.

‚ÄúThere are plans to burn tyres at up to 10 locations in Khon Kaen.‚Äù

A spokeswoman said Yingluck did not agree with the threat by the activist leader to use force, and her party said any support for her should be peaceful.

Yingluck was at her Bangkok home on Wednesday, where she donated alms to Buddhist monks, and was preparing for the court‚Äôs decision, her lawyer said.

‚ÄúThe defence team and former prime minister Yingluck are ready to hear the verdict,‚Äù her lawyer, Norrawit Larlaeng, Yingluck‚Äôs lawyer, told Reuters.

Police were setting up a barricades and a checkpoint outside the Supreme Court, where the verdict will be delivered, while Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, said the government wanted to avoid trouble.

‚ÄúThe government is worried about the people. We don‚Äôt want to use force,‚Äù Prayuth, a former army chief who ousted Yingluck‚Äôs government in the 2014 coup, told reporters.

POLITICAL IMPACT

Former telecommunications tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra, overthrown in a 2006 coup and living quietly in self-exile to avoid a 2008 conviction for graft he said was politically motivated, has made no public comment on his sister‚Äôs case.

Trakool Meechai, a former political science professor at Bangkok‚Äôs Chulalongkorn University, said widespread sustained protests in response to a conviction of Yingluck were unlikely, given the firm grip the military has imposed.

But in the long-term, a conviction could deter future governments from intervening to support markets.

‚ÄúNo matter how this case turns out it will have an impact on Thai politics,‚Äù Trakool told Reuters. ‚ÄúThis case will be a litmus test for how future politicians will manage the country.‚Äù

A verdict of innocent would invigorate the rank and file of the Shinawatras‚Äô embattled Puea Thai Party and boost its prospects in a general election the junta has promised to hold in 2018.

‚ÄúIf the case is thrown out it will increase the strength of Yingluck and her Puea Thai Party and this will show in the next election,‚Äù Trakool said.

Two potential leaders have emerged to lead the party in the election, one of them from within the Shinawatra family.

But a guilty verdict would spell the end of Yingluck‚Äôs political career, deal a heavy blow to the Shinawatras and their loyalists, and deepen the political divisions that the military has vowed to heal.

"Alexey Lutsenko wins Vuelta‚Äôs 5th stage, Chris Froome adds to lead","Froome increased his two-second race lead over Tejay van Garderen to 10 seconds. (Source: AP) Froome increased his two-second race lead over Tejay van Garderen to 10 seconds. (Source: AP)

Chris Froome increased his lead in the Spanish Vuelta during a fifth stage won by Alexey Lutsenko of Kazakhstan on Wednesday. Froome started the day just two seconds ahead of a trio of riders and with most of this top rivals within a minute.

But after most of them struggled through a hilly stage and then toiled on the race‚Äôs first summit finish, Froome looks to be in command of a race that he has finished as runner-up on three occasions.

‚ÄúLooking at the time gaps now, the general classification is definitely taking a bit more shape,‚Äù Froome said. ‚ÄúAnd if you think there‚Äôs just a 3 kilometer climb to the finish, I can definitely be happy.‚Äù

Lutsenko left behind Marco Haller at the start of the stage‚Äôs finally climb, a short but steep trudge up to the Ermita de Santa Lucia church and its views of the Mediterranean Sea.

Lutsenko finished the 175.7-kilometer (109.1-mile) ride from Benicassim to Alcossebre in 4 hours, 24 minutes. It was the first grand tour stage win for the 24-year-old Astana rider.

After a small group of breakaway riders trickled across the line, Froome stuck to the wheel of Alberto Contador as the two traded attacks along with Esteban Chaves.

Froome increased his two-second race lead over Tejay van Garderen to 10 seconds. Nicolas Roche, David de la Cruz, Fabio Aru, Vincenzo Nibali and Romain Bardet all lost even more time to the four-time Tour de France winner.

Chaves is third overall, 11 seconds back. Nibali is now 36 seconds behind in sixth place, while Aru trails by 49 in seventh, and Bardet is 12th at 1:37. Contador remained over three minutes behind.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised to see Vincenzo Nibali and Fabio Aru lose some time today ‚Äì and Romain Bardet, but it‚Äôs a long race,‚Äù Froome said.

The route took riders over four category-two climbs and a category-three, before a push up the final category-three ascent.

Thursday‚Äôs sixth stage is a 204.4-kilometer (127-mile) run from Vila-real to Sagunt including four category-three and one category-two climbs. The race ends in Madrid on Sept. 10.

* Election day is Sept. 11

Norway‚Äôs economic growth will exceed its historical average in 2018, and the government should ‚Äútake a step back‚Äù on fiscal spending, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said on Wednesday.

The economy of western Europe‚Äôs top producer of oil and gas was hit by a sharp fall in the price of crude from 2014 to 2016, but growth has since picked up along with a partial recovery in oil prices.

‚ÄúIt was right to spend more money when that was needed, but now it‚Äôs time to take a step back,‚Äù Solberg told a news conference ahead of a two-day government budget conference.

‚ÄúNext year we expect the mainland economy to grow more rapidly than its historical average,‚Äù she added.

The annual spending of cash from the country‚Äôs $975 billion sovereign wealth fund, the world‚Äôs largest, should stay at three percent or below, Solberg said.

With less than three weeks to go before parliamentary elections, opinion polls show the minority right-wing government and its centrist backers are locked in a too-close-to-call race with the centre-left opposition.

"Nepal to hold general, provincial elections on Nov 26","While voters will directly vote for 165 lawmakers, 110 members of Parliament will be nominated through proportional representation. (Source: AP Photo) While voters will directly vote for 165 lawmakers, 110 members of Parliament will be nominated through proportional representation. (Source: AP Photo)

Nepal will hold parliamentary and provincial elections on November 26, the government announced on Monday, a key step towards cementing democracy in the politically unstable country. The decision was taken during a Cabinet meeting held this morning here, according to officials. ‚ÄúThe government took the decision to conduct the elections after holding consultations with the Election Commission (EC),‚Äù Minister for Information Mohan Bahadur Basnet told reporters.

The EC will work out the details of the elections.

As per the constitutional provision, the Nepalese Parliament will have 275 members.

While voters will directly vote for 165 lawmakers, 110 members of Parliament will be nominated through proportional representation.

Earlier, the EC had urged the government to conduct elections in two phases, saying that it would be difficult to conduct both the elections at once due to time constraint, lack of laws and human resources as well as logistic.

The announcement for holding the polls came nearly two months after Nepal conducted the second round of local-level polls across the country.

The EC had been preparing to hold federal and provincial elections in 31 mountainous and hilly districts.

Millions of Nepalese voted in the first two phases of local-level polls held in almost two decades as the Himalayan nation takes a key step towards cementing democracy.

Nepal has witnessed political instability.

The country has been in a political crisis since a decade-long Maoist conflict ended in 2006 and the monarchy was abolished.

Some Madhes-centric parties were opposed the elections on the ground that the new Constitution be amended to accommodate their views: more representation in the Parliament and redrawing of provincial boundaries.

Madhesis, who are mostly of Indian origin, had launched a prolonged agitation between September 2015 and February last year against the implementation of the Constitution.

World Badminton Championships: Sai Praneeth qualifies for pre-quarters,"B Sai Praneeth won his match with a scoreline of 14-21, 21-18, 21-19. (Source: File) B Sai Praneeth won his match with a scoreline of 14-21, 21-18, 21-19. (Source: File)

B Sai Praneeth sported a constant grimace through 72 minutes of his Round 2 match against Indonesian Anthony Ginting. Yes, he had scraped the side of his right index finger diving about and needing treatment. He‚Äôd also pleaded for a medical intervention on the penultimate point ‚Äì and dug himself a couple of holes around which he scampered in desperation, causing coach Mulyo Handoyo to later palm his forehead over and over again in deep exasperation. ‚ÄúHe always looks like that (a little ill with worry). When the court is slow, he‚Äôs in a hurry to finish the match and wrap up and go home,‚Äù P Gopichand who knows him a little more than the Indonesian, joked at the end of the 14-21, 21-18, 21-19 see-saw match.

Both, player and coach, conceded he had been lucky to pull off the match where he started 0-8 down, as the conditions tested India‚Äôs best stroke-maker the most. But first, the match as it panned out to the bemusement of all involved, most of all the Indonesian who imploded in vintage Praneethesque fashion, losing from being 18-12 up in the decider.

Like in his opener against Hong Kong‚Äôs Wei Nan, Sai Praneeth, India‚Äôs 24-year-old Singapore Super Series winner, struggled with the slow shuttles, and the early Ginting blur of fast shots. So paralysed was his decision-making by the blitz that his maiden World Championship outing looked akin to a wide-eyed newbie‚Äôs ‚Äì 0-8, 6-16 and 12-20 before he jolted himself from the slump. Game 2 would stay close till 16-all, though Sai, with a better variety of strokes had disciplined what to do with his armoury, and was gritting out the long rallies.

The Hyderabadi‚Äôs career is replete with close matches where he‚Äôs been hammered from 17-all situations, not managing to close out. ‚ÄúBut the Singapore title changed everything. I‚Äôve been winning the closing stages from then,‚Äù he would say later. Still struggling with the pace, but willing to stick it out in the attritional battles, Sai would assert his quality strokes to level the sets, though it was just the start of the drama.

6-2 up in the third, he would allow the busy and aggressive Ginting three spurts of points in a bunch, as the match stood poised at 12-18. ‚ÄúI was almost losing, that‚Äôs when I relaxed and took it one point at a time. I was desperate,‚Äù he said. When Sai is desperate ‚Äì his stroking options zone in, and he can dig his heels quite stubbornly forgetting how beautiful his strokes are.

Three long rallies would see him retrieve doggedly, and finish with signature strokes that are unconventional from the start. Tough to tell if Ginting got carried away by Pied Piper Praneeth‚Äôs skilled deceptive kills and attempted to ape it with a few of his own, a fatal error. Or if the 18-12 score simply made the Indonesian lose it and rush his returns to quickly finish off, but the tide slowly turned.

First one, then a bunch of points, Sai would start narrowing the gap that saw him simply draw out the worst from Ginting. The latter would try a dozen fancy things, going wide for the lines or too much on the front of the court, when basic body smashes would‚Äôve gotten the job done. He‚Äôd also drop his speed by 10 percent ‚Äì immediately giving relief to Sai who had been bamboozled by the earlier scorching pace.

Sai stayed patient while jumping on these soft shots and fleeing jail as he ran up 8 straight points to finish the match. ‚ÄúThese conditions are as tough as they can get for a player like Sai Praneeth who likes to play his strokes and finish off,‚Äù Gopichand would say.

Sai‚Äôs had his best results in colder climes ‚Äì a first round upset of Chong Wei at All England and had been looking forward to playing here. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also beautiful conditions for badminton,‚Äù Gopichand would add.

No drift, no cry

They tell you to sip water straight off the tap these parts of the world ‚Äì no filters needed. At the badminton stadium in Scotland, they tell you to play with no fear of the dreaded drift that wrecks havoc on games galore in smaller, intimate Asian arenas with the whirring air-conditioners.

But strokes stay true, without whizzing around madly like when drifts force adjustments from one end, and shuttles go beserk leaving players bogged down. It‚Äôs easier to control the shots, though these conditions demand another kind of skill.

‚ÄúSlow shuttles don‚Äôt give you easy points ‚Äì so even if Ginting needed just three points, he had to earn those points. If you expect the shuttles to zip around and land you points, that won‚Äôt happen,‚Äù Gopichand explained. ‚ÄúYou are expected to follow up.‚Äù

Typically, this would help the defensive, steady players ‚Äì Chen Long, Viktor Axelsen (who detests drifts and has twice lost to Ajay Jayram in windy courts), Son Wan-Ho as well as Nozumi Okuhara and Sung Ji Hyun. Chinese top seeds in men‚Äôs doubles ‚Äì Li Junhui and Liu Yuchen, would be done in by the slow shuttles as would Olympic silver medallists from Malaysia Goh-Tan.

Shuttlers are eventually expected to get used to the conditions ‚Äì lighting and the slow bird, as smashes start penetrating and get precise, but till then it‚Äôs bound to be hard work with exact returns on the effort put on the shot without any external breeze mucking about and exaggerating or impeding where the shuttle runs off.

Saina negotiates opener

Tough first rounds are typically Saina Nehwal, but she was glad for the good workout with long rallies ahead of her pre-quarters with Korean World No 2 Sung Ji Hyun, a defensive machine like her Swiss opponent Sabrina Jaquet whom the Indian beat 21-11, 21-12.

‚ÄúMy first round experience is always horrible, so I tend to focus extra,‚Äù she would say after the 33 minute scrap. Jaquet might not be the fittest, but she loves chasing the shuttle down.

Anyone in a hurry to finish would be punished, and Nehwal was quick on the uptake to realise that she couldn‚Äôt blindly hit through a first-round opponent. While Sai needed to exercise another kind of discipline, Nehwal simply needed to cut down on the easy path. ‚ÄúYou have to play very smart shots. It‚Äôs almost like mathematics. You have to keep moving and play a shot in a way that the next shot is comfortable for you and in your control. Not like you are struggling and moving and the opponent is in control,‚Äùshe would say.

So, there were three variations on the drops ‚Äì angled at the last moment, and she would pick the shuttle early at the net for a juggler-like forehand. Not too chuffed about her movement on the day, she stressed she needed to do better against the Korean whom she‚Äôs beaten much, but remains a tough pre-quarter opponent in a Worlds match. ‚ÄúTrick is to not be frustrated if Sung keeps picking, and tell yourself that your opening will do the work. You can‚Äôt get outright points and hit through opponents. It‚Äôs perfect conditions,‚Äù coach Vimal Kumar would say. Glasgow affords no excuses.

Indian results: K Srikanth bt Lucas Corvee 21-9, 21-17; Rajiv Ouseph (Eng) bt Sameer Verma 22-20, 21-9, Jyun Ji Sung (PRK) bt Tanvi Lad 21-9 21-19; Kamilla Rytter Juhl/Christina Pedersen (Den) bt Ashwini Ponnappa/Sikki Reddy 24-22, 17-21, 21-15; Saina Nehwal bt Sabrina Jaquet (Sui) 21-11, 21-12; B Sai Praneeth bt Anthony Ginting 14-21, 21-18, 21-19; Yixin Bao/Xiaohan Yu (Chn) bt Sanjana Santosh/Arathi Sunil 21-14 21-15.

Egypt cancels Jared Kushner meeting with minister after denial of aid,"White House senior adviser Jared Kushner (Source: AP Photo) White House senior adviser Jared Kushner (Source: AP Photo)

Egypt called off a scheduled meeting between its foreign minister and top US presidential adviser Jared Kushner on Wednesday after the United States decided to withhold millions of dollars in aid. But President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi would meet the US delegation led by Kushner later in the day as scheduled, Sisi‚Äôs office said.

Two US sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that Washington had decided to deny Egypt $95.7 million in aid and to delay a further $195 million because of its failure to make progress on respecting human rights and democratic norms. ‚ÄúEgypt sees this measure as reflecting poor judgment of the strategic relationship that ties the two countries over long decades and as adopting a view that lacks an accurate understanding of the importance of supporting Egypt‚Äôs stability,‚Äù the foreign ministry said in a statement.

The decision could have ‚Äúnegative implications‚Äù on achieving common goals and interests between the two countries, it added. Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry had been scheduled to meet the US delegation led by Kushner, a son-in-law to US President Donald Trump and a close adviser, on Wednesday in Cairo to discuss the Middle East.

But the meeting was cancelled immediately after the ministry released its statement, a copy of Shoukry‚Äôs schedule sent out to journalists showed. A foreign ministry official told Reuters the meeting had been cancelled but did not give a reason. A US embassy official in Cairo said Kushner‚Äôs meeting with Shoukry had never been set in stone because ‚Äúthe schedule was never fixed.‚Äù

"India vs Sri Lanka, 2nd ODI: Losing seven wickets in a chase of 230 is bizarre, says Virat Kohli","India won by 3 wickets in second ODI against Sri Lanka. (Source: PTI) India won by 3 wickets in second ODI against Sri Lanka. (Source: PTI)

MS Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar Kumar anchored India to a 3-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the second ODI of the five-match series in Kandy. India were initially cruising while chasing a target of 231 but lost the plot in the middle and were reduced to 131/7. An unbeaten hundred-run stand between Dhoni and Kumar for the 8th wicket sealed India‚Äôs win.

Indian skipper Virat Kohli during the post-match presentation hailed Akila Danajaya‚Äôs bowling and said, ‚Äúquite an exciting game of cricket, fans and players entertained. Good to come through eventually. Two 100-run partnerships in a chase of 230 with seven wickets, that‚Äôs quite bizarre. When you‚Äôre 110 for 1, in a chase of 230, you want to give everyone a chance to bat. We don‚Äôt have any regrets. If I had gone at No. 3, I would have still missed that ball because he was bowling that well. We thought he was the offspinner with a good legbreak, but he got four wickets off googlies. We‚Äôll be more careful next time. Credit to him for pitching the ball in the right areas.‚Äù

Sri Lanka captain Upul Tharanga expressed his disappointment after the second loss on the trot in the series.

‚ÄúDisappointed, we came really close. We didn‚Äôt capitalise again. They had a good start. Once they needed 100 runs, we tried everything. We just couldn‚Äôt get the breakthrough. Our bowling and fielding has improved,‚Äù he said.

Akila Dnanajaya scalped a six-for during India‚Äôs innings which went in vain eventually. He said, ‚Äù The offspin was working, so continuously used the variations. I came back to the hotel at around 11PM last evening.‚Äù

Now, sure, there are superbly inspirational words of wisdom spoken and written by some of the best minds in the world, and we're not denying that the mind does benefit from those, but sometimes what we really need is dry humour that would kick us upright, make us think and present us with a different perspective to life, while giving us something to laugh about.

"Shiv Sena compares Jain monk to Zakir Naik, says BJP won polls using ‚Äòmoney‚Äô, ‚Äòmuni‚Äô","The BJP has hit out at the Sena stating that it needs to introspect for the reasons behind its defeat instead of blaming a religious leader. (Representational Image) The BJP has hit out at the Sena stating that it needs to introspect for the reasons behind its defeat instead of blaming a religious leader. (Representational Image)

Two days after the Bharatiya Janata Party won the Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation polls with a clear majority, the Shiv Sena charged its alliance partner in the state government of winning the polls using ‚Äúmoney‚Äù and muni (monk), referring to a Jain monk who reportedly made a videographed plea to community members to vote for the BJP.

The Sena also compared the Jain monk to controversial televangelist Dr Zakir Naik, calling his canvassing for votes a ‚Äúfatwa‚Äù. The Sena on Wednesday filed a complaint with the Election Commission of India, objecting to Jain monk Naypadmasagarji Maharaj‚Äôs video in which the spiritual leader is seen urging the community to vote for the BJP to create a ‚Äúmeat-free society‚Äù. The Sena has demanded the disqualification of the candidates who benefited from the monk‚Äôs speech.

‚ÄúThe monk has campaigned on religious lines to help BJP candidates win. The BJP won the polls using money and muni. The BJP‚Äôs victory is a disgrace to Maharashtra‚Äôs culture,‚Äù said Sanjay Raut, senior Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP, addressing the media at the Sena headquarters in Dadar.

‚ÄúThe Jama Masjid‚Äôs Imam used to come out with such fatwas earlier. Now, the Jain monk came out with a fatwa in the Mira Bhayander polls. Such people are political goons, I compare them to Zakir Naik,‚Äù said Raut. He said as campaigning on religious lines is a violation of the model code of conduct, the party has filed a complaint with the Election Commission of India and the State Election Commission.

BJP has bagged 61 seats out of 95 in the Mira Bhayander civic polls held on Sunday. The Sena, which was hoping to win more than 45 seats, received a major setback and won only 22 seats. The Congress won 10 seats while the NCP could not open its account. Raut further said the monk‚Äôs speech in the video shows his hatred towards Maharashtra.

‚ÄúThe Jain community in Mumbai and Maharashtra is very peaceful. On listening to the monk‚Äôs speech, it seems he has changed the definition of religion. The language used by the monk is a kind of violence. Those opposing meat can say that soldiers at the border should eat vegetarian food. If we listen to this, the country will drown,‚Äù said Raut, warning the monk not to use such language about the Sena in the future.

He further said the party respects Jain leaders and party leaders have visited their temples on several occasions.

‚ÄúBut if someone is trying to win elections in Maharashtra by dividing people on religious grounds, then they do not have right to utter the word ‚ÄòMaharashtra‚Äô,‚Äù said Raut, adding that the Sena had come to the community‚Äôs help during the 1993 communal riots in Mumbai. He also claimed that most girls lured into ‚ÄúLove Jihad‚Äù were from the Jain community and that the Sena was trying to save them. Incidentally, the same monk campaigned for a Sena candidate during the Lok Sabha elections in 2014. Sena leaders are clearly seen in videos sharing a dais with the monk.

The BJP has hit out at the Sena stating that it needs to introspect for the reasons behind its defeat instead of blaming a religious leader. ‚ÄúWe have always taken people from all communities with us and have won the elections. We are proud of that. We have never made any attempt to use community or religion to seek votes. It is a defeat of thieves and swindlers,‚Äù said Ashish Shelar, president of the Mumbai unit of the BJP. He further said the Sena‚Äôs statements reflect its frustration.

The All India Jain Minority Cell also condemned the Sena‚Äôs remarks against the Jain monk. ‚ÄúComparing the Jain monk to a terrorist is completely wrong. We are a peaceful community. Raut should withdraw his statements and apologise publicly to the monk,‚Äù said Lalit Gandhi, national president of the Cell.

China‚Äôs Lin Dan lives to fight another day,"Playing Danish Emil Holst, the Chinese legend was 7-12 down in the opener (losing 21-19), and couldn‚Äôt catch up to set tongues wagging about no yin without yang, and no Lee, so no Dan. (Source: Reuters) Playing Danish Emil Holst, the Chinese legend was 7-12 down in the opener (losing 21-19), and couldn‚Äôt catch up to set tongues wagging about no yin without yang, and no Lee, so no Dan. (Source: Reuters)

‚ÄúThe fears weren‚Äôt on the tip of the tongue ‚Äî at the Emirates Arena, they were boomed aloud till everyone exhaled as the score finished 19-21, 21-8, 21-16. A day after Lee Chong Wei exited in the opening round from his 10th World Championships, the stadium had begun to murmur if Lin Dan would follow him out.

Playing Danish Emil Holst, the Chinese legend was 7-12 down in the opener (losing 21-19), and couldn‚Äôt catch up to set tongues wagging about no yin without yang, and no Lee, so no Dan.

These are nervy times for badminton, which is reeling from the shock exit ‚Äî and even more rattling tatters of errors ‚Äî of the Malaysian superstar on Tuesday, who looked as out of place as a jagged outcrop of a Scottish mountain. Unlike in tennis which has seen the resurrection of Federer and Nadal this year, shuttle stands edgily on the brink of losing two of its all-time greatest.

The Glasgow Worlds are starting to imagine a world where Lin Dan and Chong Wei would be gone, though the Chinese pulled the possibility back from the brink despite going a game down. Playing a 81-minute second round match ‚Äî like walking a tightrope along the cliff ‚Äî Super Dan eventually refused to be buzzed off by a European who was hard to put down.

‚ÄúOf course, my motivation in tournaments will always be the gold medal and here that is no different. Along the way you will always have to play very hard matches so I am very pleased to come through this one,‚Äù said Dan of the tough-looking hobble into the pre-quarters.

Rarely in control

Though not a pool of errors, Lin Dan‚Äôs struggle on the day was stark in just how rarely he looked in control of the match against the Dane ranked 39. While his slowness is not too apparent in shot selection or defence, Dan is looking vulnerable on sheer strength as his opponents can bully him in rallies and pile the pressure on him.

Both in Games 1 and 3, Holst threatened to take it away from the Chinese 5-time World champion, by staying bull-headed in every single rally. While Lin Dan bossed the mid-game, it was Holst‚Äôs audacious slashing in the decider to level at 16-all that raised doubts. That the Chinese was kept on court for close to an hour and a half meant England‚Äôs Rajeev Ouseph can fancy his chances ‚Äì so can everyone who lines up next. And that in short, is the shattering of the aura.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt get much bigger than playing the greatest player that‚Äôs ever played, and in the World Championships, so it‚Äôs very exciting and the pressure‚Äôs off me a bit, so I‚Äôll just try and enjoy myself and see what I can do.I have to go into the match believing I can win this game, there are a few chinks in his armour, so I‚Äôll believe I can win tomorrow,‚Äù Ouseph said.

The BWF is contemplating the 11-point format, that will considerably reduce the length of matches, and the plan will be put up for vote in November.

It‚Äôs likely to prolong careers ‚Äì and Chong Wei and Dan can both start dreaming of Tokyo if that comes about, but these are two severely weakened legends. It‚Äôs not so much their games ‚Äì which carry hangovers of the sublime ‚Äì but the sheer audacity of younger, fitter challengers that is making this dethroning an interesting prospect.

Chen Long‚Äôs long taken over from Dan as the top Chinese hope, but it‚Äôs opening up the draws for those like young Indian K Srikanth and Danish Viktor Axelsen to take a shot at medals. On Wednesday, even Emil Holst fancied his chances against none other than Lin Dan.

Vivegam movie review: Thala Ajith gets full marks for this popcorn entertainer,"Vivegam movie review: It is Ajith‚Äôs show all the way. His look and onscreen charisma help audience disregard serious logical follies in the writing. Vivegam movie review: It is Ajith‚Äôs show all the way. His look and onscreen charisma help audience disregard serious logical follies in the writing.

Vivegam movie cast: Ajith, Kajal Aggarwal, Akshara Haasan, Vivek Oberoi

Vivegam movie director: Siva

Vivegam movie rating: 3 stars

Director Siva is the greatest fan of Thala Ajith. Nobody can match him when it comes to admiring Ajith and his looks. So much so that he has made a film called Vivegam spending more than Rs 100 crore. The film opens with highly-skilled assassin Ajay Kumar (Ajith) leading a one-man mission to secure a device that contains details of activating a nuclear weapon. He worms into the enemy lines and wreaks havoc.

At the end of the first action sequence, before jumping off the iconic Contra Dam, Ajay mouths the popular punchline ‚Äì ‚ÄúNever ever, give up.‚Äù Just when his enemies think that they have got him boxed up, he pulls off something impossible and completes the mission successfully. That is the gist of the film. Vivegam is all about the exploits of one man, who can never be beaten.

Ajay is a flawless character and he is a master at many things. Be it searching and killing his targets, riding cars and bikes, or helping his wife with cooking in her restaurant, you name it. An exemplary human being that you cannot help but adore him. From the beginning to the end, Siva has been consistent in playing up all the goodness in Ajay, which after some time makes you snooze. About 30 minutes into the film, it feels like, ‚Äúyes, yes we understand he is a deity in human form. Can we please get to the story already?‚Äù

Ajay may be a killer but he has a heart full of love and trust for his wife and friends. And that‚Äôs the main reason for his downfall. While he can read his targets if they are lying or not, he cannot identify the backstabbers in his team masquerading as friends.

Aryan Singha (Vivek Oberoi) is Ajay‚Äôs teammate but more than that he is Ajay‚Äôs brother from another mother. At least, until he decided to empty his gun into Ajay‚Äôs back. Both are top officials of an international spy agency. Let‚Äôs say it is a conglomerate of spy agencies of the world. Ajay is tasked with a mission to find hacker Natasha, who has a new face after undergoing a facial surgery. She has the keys to activate nuclear weapons that can cause artificial earthquakes in any place on earth.

Natasha (Akshara Haasan) gets a subtle but more interesting introduction in the film. She carries the information worth billions of dollars in two hard disks. And it has nearly become impossible for operatives to track and nab her. Well, as we know Ajay is the right man for an impossible task, he finds her and soon forges an intimate bonding with her. And things go haywire as Ajay finds out he just got played.

Aryan turns against him. It was only a matter of time, one could have guessed it. Ajay now rises from the ashes and seeks retribution against those who wronged him.

Ajay has a beautiful wife, Yazhini Kumar (Kajal Aggarwal). Yazhini is a very dutiful wife, who understands her husband‚Äôs life is always on the line. And keeps calling him to know his well-being. And Ajay never misses answering her calls, even in a high-speed chase. Before the end of the first part, Ajay answers Yazhini‚Äôs phone when he is hanging on to a branch of a tree as he is being fired at by his new enemies. He promises her that he will return to her alive. So, he does. It‚Äôs actually funny when you come to think of it. No matter who you are or what situation you are in, you must answer the phone when your wife calls. Period. Even when you are dying. Period.

Ajay gets shot multiple times in the back. But, instead of urgently seeking the emergency medical help, he goes on doing high-intensity workouts on the snowy mountains to adrenaline pumping ‚ÄòThala Viduthalai‚Äô track in preparation to fight his enemies. How he survived the bullet wounds is never explained.

Vivek falls short of invoking any feelings in the audience. He backstabs his close friend and tries to bomb India. But, still, we don‚Äôt hate him because he is always praising Ajay and how. Even when he is defeated again and again, instead of ruing over his failure, he ends up admiring Ajay. And that makes his character completely unrealistic.

It is Ajith‚Äôs show all the way. His look and onscreen charisma help audience disregard serious logical follies in the writing. As the titles roll off at the end of the film, the audience is shown the behind-the-scenes videos shot during the action sequences. And one can see the effort that has gone into making this fancy film. Ajith and Siva get full marks for their efforts.

Vivegam has good music, good visuals, high-voltage action sequences, picturesque landscapes and beautiful faces. Also add heartwarming moments between the characters of Ajith and Kajal to the list. If you can overlook adulation, irrelevant emotions and unfounded logic, Vivegam is a good popcorn entertainer.

It is time to heal the wounds that divide Americans: Donald Trump,"US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

President Donald Trump has called for national unity based on common values in the US, days after his controversial remarks over the racist violence in Virginia drew widespread criticism. Trump, at a rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, had defended his response to a deadly far right march in Virginia and condemned ‚Äúdishonest‚Äù media coverage of his widely criticised remarks.

Trump had faced widespread outrage after blaming ‚Äúmany sides‚Äù for violence at the rally in Charlottesville that killed an anti-fascist protester. Trump, however, struck a drastically different tone on Wednesday and called for healing ‚Äúthe wounds that divide us‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is time to heal the wounds that divide us and to seek a new unity based on the common values that unite us. We are one people with one home and one great flag,‚Äù Trump told a crowd of veterans at an American Legion conference in Reno, Nevada.

‚ÄúWe are not defined by the colour of our skin, the figure on our paycheck or the party of our politics. We are defined by our shared humanity, by our citizenship in this magnificent nation, and by the love that fills our hearts,‚Äù he said seeking unity among his countrymen.

‚ÄúI speak for all of you when I say our hearts beat for America. Our souls fill with pride every time we hear the national anthem. This is the spirit we need to overcome our challenges, to pursue our common destiny and to achieve a brighter future for our people. We will win. Watch. We will win,‚Äù he said.

Trump said that American can build their future together if they have the courage to act, the strength to endure and the patriotism to join together with true affection for fellow citizen. Trump has been accused of creating divisions in the country post Charlottesville violence in which a white supremacist left one dead and several injured after driving his car into counter-protesters.

Trump on the other hand has alleged that it is the media which is providing hate a space in their reporting. ‚ÄúAs long as we have faith in each other, and confidence in our values, then there is no challenge too great for us to conquer. We are people. We are people who love. We are people with heart. We are people who adore. We are people that are great. There is no country which like the United States of America,‚Äù he said amidst applause from the audience.

‚ÄúWe have no division too deep for us to heal, and there is no enemy too strong for us to overcome. Because in America, we never lose faith. We never forget who we are, and we never stop striving for a better future. Together, we cannot fail. We will not fail. We will make America great again ‚Äî greater than ever before, I promise,‚Äù said the US President.

Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the President is looking at ways that ‚Äúwe can unify and break down some of the division that we think is taking place in our country.‚Äù She said President Trump strongly feels that a lot of that can be done through growing the economy, creating better jobs, and helping people have a better life. And that‚Äôs certainly a big priority for this administration moving into the fall.

‚ÄúTax reform ‚Äî a tax relief, certainly for the middle class, is going to be a priority for the administration. It‚Äôs something you‚Äôll see us put a lot of focus and emphasis on while we continue to look at the best ways to create a job-friendly environment and a strong economy,‚Äù Sanders said.

Africa to break new ground with World Championships bid,"One of six African nations will bid to host the 2025 World Athletics Championships as the continent hopes to stage the global meet for a first time, the Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) president Hamad Kalkaba Malboum has said.

African countries have previously held several major sporting events with South Africa hosting the 2010 FIFA World Cup and Morocco staging an IAAF Diamond League event this year. Three nations also co-hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

Malboum believes that the continent‚Äôs previous hosting record indicated that the biennial championships could also be held successfully in Africa.

‚ÄúWe are talking with Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Morocco ‚Äî those countries have the facilities,‚Äù Malboum told the BBC on Wednesday.

‚ÄúI have very positive sounds from some of them. ‚ÄúPeople said that Africa could not host the World Cup in football, but we did it very successfully.‚Äù

Malboum added that the governing body IAAF‚Äôs head Sebastian Coe was also in favour of a bid from within the continent.

‚ÄúPresident Coe is supporting the fact that Africa could host the World Championships,‚Äù the 66-year-old added.

The Cameroonian said that African countries had now come to understand the importance of the event after showing little interest in hosting the championships in the past.

‚ÄúI think many now realise that (staging the championships) could put the nation on the world map in terms of publicity and promote tourism, so there is a benefit from hosting the event. This was not the case in the past,‚Äù Malboum said.

Qatar and the U.S. will host the 2019 and 2021 championships respectively, with the decision on the hosts for the 2025 edition set to be announced in 2020.

Apple iPhone 8 could be launched on September 12: Report,"Apple iPhone 8 could be launched on September 12, claims a new report. (Source: Danny Winget/YouTube) Apple iPhone 8 could be launched on September 12, claims a new report. (Source: Danny Winget/YouTube)

We‚Äôre only a few weeks away from the launch of the iPhone 8, as a new report suggests the next-generation smartphone could be launched on September 12. The information has been shared by French website Mac4Ever, which claims it confirmed the news from a few French telecom companies. The site also claims the iPhone 8 is expected to go on sale on September 22.

This wouldn‚Äôt be a huge surprise in itself, as the company has been launching a new iPhone in the month of September. However, previous reports have claimed that Apple would delay the unveiling of the iPhone 8 due to major technology upgrades being added to the tenth anniversary iPhone. Some scattered reports even said that the launch of the iPhone 8 could be delayed by at least three weeks from the original schedule. Apple is yet to confirm the announcement of the new iPhone with the press.

Apple iPhone 8 is expected to come with a host of new features, including an all-new 5.8-inch OLED display with slim bezels, wireless charging, a vertical dual-camera setup, a glass back, and a steel frame. It‚Äôs also being said that Apple will finally retire its TouchID fingerprint scanner from the iPhone 8. Instead, the phone might feature a 3D camera that can unlock the device with facial recognition. But all that will come at a huge price tag, and as Apple may ask users to pay more than $1000 (or approx Rs 65,000) for the iPhone 8.

On the other hand, Apple is reportedly launch two more models of the iPhone. French site says the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will join the iPhone 8 on September 12. All three smartphones will be made available on September 22. Both iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will offer marginal upgrades like wireless charging, but they would retain the physical home button.

Apple‚Äôs September event could also see the launch of the third-generation Apple Watch. We might also see an upgraded version of the Apple TV with 4K support at the same press event.

Sharing the future,"India and Nepal must build on the socio-cultural foundations of their relationship to meet the economic and ecological challenges of the 21st century (Subrata Dhar) India and Nepal must build on the socio-cultural foundations of their relationship to meet the economic and ecological challenges of the 21st century (Subrata Dhar)

Nepal‚Äôs relative underdevelopment mimics the paradox of an ‚Äúirresistible force meeting an immovable object‚Äù where the compelling potential of a uniquely attractive country sits under-utilised. The young republic has no choice but to ramp up its economic ambition if it is to match the tall political achievements of recent years. Nepal today is a progressive country, propelled by the democratic mass movements of 1950, 1990 and 2006, heading in earnest towards building a deeply inclusive state.

Despite modest economic growth, Nepal halved absolute poverty in the past two decades. It dramatically reduced rates of child and maternal mortality. Primary school enrolment, with gender parity, exceeds 97 per cent, and average life expectancy has crossed 70. Nepal also stands out on several measures of civic engagement, from well-managed community forests to community radio. After years of policy paralysis, there is broad realisation now that the country needs to project a clear roadmap to prosperity. We envision Nepal as an enterprise-friendly middle-income country by 2030, peopled by a vibrant middle-class. To get there we need to mobilise an unprecedented volume of public revenue and private investment, domestic and foreign, by signalling credible economic reforms, relaxing binding infrastructural constraints, and designing inclusive institutions.

Nepal and India are among the closest of neighbours in the world. In the 21st century, the challenge is to build on our socio-cultural foundations to leapfrog economically. We now need to mould our thinking to the possibilities and challenges of the 21st century. How do we groom young people for jobs with technology-aided skills? How do we cooperate on mutually beneficial terms on water and clean energy, and help mitigate climate change? How do we accelerate the reduction of poverty, inequality and vulnerability? How do we build sustainable cities and livable habitats? How do we adopt new paradigms of production and exchange? Over the next decade, a sincere pursuit of the following clusters of development issues could lift us all.

One, wider connectivity. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed Nepal‚Äôs Parliament three years ago, he spoke of the importance of highways, infoways and transways (HIT). To reduce trade and business costs, to deepen people-to-people ties and to open up new economic opportunities, Nepal needs to connect with growth poles in the region through 21st century electric railways, expressways and expanded air routes directly connecting more cities in Nepal to more cities in its neighbouring countries. Furthermore, the building of synchronised transmission grids to trade hydropower generated electricity will help boost green growth.

Two, augmenting productivity. Nepal‚Äôs formidable topography makes material access to world markets costly. However, the availability of clean energy, an affordable workforce and the unexploited bounties in niche sectors with high value-to-weight ratios make Nepal uniquely tempting to investors. Tourism and landscape marketing can be an anchor of prosperity. The fertile Tarai lands and agro-climates in the hills could support a much more productive agriculture than they do today. The rise of the large Indian middle class, and investors, present opportunities on both sides, with Nepal‚Äôs hills being potential locations for world-class tourism, as well as education and health institutions.

Three, tapping new economic possibilities. Nepal today faces an enormous trade deficit with India, as production competencies shrink and large inflows of remittances fuel growth in imports. The share of Nepal‚Äôs manufacturing sector has plunged from a peak of 10 per cent of GDP in 1996 to around 5 per cent today. However, patterns of trade and industrialisation are evolving. The new emphasis, for example, is on fragmented tasks rather than complete industries. ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù and related campaigns to turn the country into the next global hub for manufacturing presents a great opportunity for Nepal to latch on to fragments of the regional value chain. Sectors like textiles, auto parts, electronics, food-processing and pharmaceuticals embed low-hanging fruits. Nepal‚Äôs hydropower can also spur high-energy high-tech sectors such as server farms.

Four, applying mass social innovation. Nepal is an early champion of welfare schemes even at a low stage of development, spending about 4 per cent of national income on social transfers. However, India‚Äôs ambitious embrace of modern information and communication technologies, affordable insurance and pension schemes and guaranteed employment are breakthroughs in social innovation that could be emulated in the region. We must adopt and further viable social protection measures to stem the challenges posed by inequality and vulnerability.

Five, protecting the regional commons. The Himalayas are one of Nepal‚Äôs ‚Äî and the world‚Äôs ‚Äî greatest natural assets. South Asia will face a major shortfall in the supply of fresh water over the next decade. This crisis will directly hit subsistence, morbidity and the survival of tens of millions of people. Globally, we are all bound to help limit temperature increase to within 2-degrees above pre-industrial levels. Nepal‚Äôs big rivers can be a source of clean energy that can displace dirty sources of power in the Subcontinent.

The relative advantages of South Asian countries can be pooled to match each of our needs through common power grids. Just as upstream water pollution from cities and industries in Nepal could harm agriculture and drinking water in India in the future, air pollution transported to Nepal from much larger sources in India has already been documented to be adversely affecting Nepal‚Äôs environment, including at the Buddha‚Äôs birthplace, Lumbini. The emission of short-lived climate pollutants, such as black carbon, warms the atmosphere, changes monsoon precipitation patterns and melts Himalayan glaciers. Cooperation on governing our regional commons is vital for our shared quests of good health and progress.

Both India and Nepal are dominated by a youthful population with demographic dividends yet to be reaped. By 2020, the median age will still just be 29 in India and 25 in Nepal. During the visit to India this week by the Prime Minister of Nepal, Sher Bahadur Deuba, it will be a mark of departure to look to the future, not just the past, and to pledge a pursuit of a forward-looking development agenda where each country helps the other on initiatives that are transformative in nature.

Lebanon monitored Australia bomb plot suspects: Lebanese Interior Minister,"Lebanese Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk told a news conference that one of the men‚Äôs brothers, Tareq Khayat, had moved to the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa in Syria and become a commander in the jihadist group more than a year ago.

(Representational Image)

Lebanon monitored the brothers accused of plotting to blow up a flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi for more than a year and coordinated with the Australian government on it for a long time, the Lebanese interior minister said on Monday. Australian police charged Khaled Khayat and Mahmoud Khayat this month with two counts of planning a terrorist attack after conducting raids to disrupt what authorities described as an Islamic State-inspired plot to bomb an Etihad Airways flight.

Lebanese Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk told a news conference that one of the men‚Äôs brothers, Tareq Khayat, had moved to the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa in Syria and become a commander in the jihadist group more than a year ago.

Lebanon‚Äôs Internal Security Force then placed Tareq, Khaled and Mahmoud Khayat, and a fourth brother, Amer Khayat, under surveillance. Khaled, Mahmoud and Amer were all living in Australia but occasionally visited Lebanon, he said in Beirut. Machnouk said the brothers were Lebanese.

He said Amer Khayat had arrived in Lebanon on July 15, the day Australian police have said the plotters tried to smuggle a bomb onto an Etihad flight from Sydney. Australian police also said a man had tried to check in luggage without knowing that it contained a bomb, which was hidden in a meat grinder, placed there by his brother. However, Machnouk said Amer Khayat was to have carried out the attack and that a Lebanese internal intelligence agency had found he was ‚Äúinvolved in the operation‚Äù. He said a bomb had also been hidden in a large child‚Äôs doll in the luggage.

He did not say what has happened to Amer Khayat since he landed in Lebanon. The plot was foiled because the luggage exceeded the airline‚Äôs weight limit, Machnouk said.

Australian police had previously said it appeared that one of the accused had left the airport, taking the luggage with him, while his brother boarded the plane and left Australia. On Tuesday, Australian police said it was not appropriate to comment further on the details of a current investigation that was also before Australian courts. ‚ÄúWe have a close and cooperative relationship with the Lebanese authorities and are working closely on this investigation,‚Äù an Australian Federal Police spokeswoman said in an email.

Asked whether the operation would have been successful if the luggage had not exceeded the weight limit, Machnouk said: ‚ÄúProbably, yes‚Äù. He said information from Lebanese intelligence had ‚Äúassisted in foiling a large operation aiming to blow up a plane‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe plane had 120 Lebanese on board in addition to other nationalities,‚Äù Machnouk said.

(Source: Twitter) Tottenham Hotspur had been the only English Premier League team yet to make a signing this summer. (Source: Twitter)

Tottenham completed its first signings of the summer transfer window by bringing in Colombia center back Davinson Sanchez and Argentine goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga on Wednesday.

Sanchez joined from Ajax for a reported fee of 42 million pounds ($53.75, which would be a club record for Spurs, after passing his medical examination and learning he would be granted a work permit.

Gazzaniga was signed from Southampton, the former club of Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino. He is likely to be battling with Michel Vorm to be the back-up goalkeeper to captain Hugo Lloris.

Tottenham had been the only English Premier League team yet to make a signing this summer. Last season‚Äôs runner-up in the league sold right back Kyle Walker to Manchester City.

Also, Swansea began spending some of the 45 million pounds (then $58 million) the club received from Gylfi Sigurdsson‚Äôs move to Everton last week by signing midfielder Sam Clucas from Hull, which was relegated from the Premier League in May.

The fee for Clucas was not disclosed.

Dollar regains some footing after falling on Donald Trump‚Äôs comments,"US President Donald Trump (File) US President Donald Trump (File)

The dollar edged higher against the yen on Thursday, paring some of the losses it suffered after US President Donald Trump suggested a shutdown of the government was possible and threatened to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump warned late on Tuesday he might end the NAFTA trade treaty with Mexico and Canada after three-way talks failed to bridge deep differences. He also said he may shut the government if he does not get funding to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. His remarks, made ahead of a debate in Congress over a spending package and raising the debt ceiling, knocked the dollar lower on Wednesday.

The US Congress will have about 12 working days, when it returns on Sept. 5 from summer break, to approve spending measures to keep the government from shutting. Also, a deadline is nearing for raising the cap on how much the federal government may borrow. In June, the Congressional Budget Office said Congress needs to raise the debt limit by early to mid-October to avoid a default. The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 109.16 yen, regaining some ground in the wake of its 0.5 percent drop on Wednesday.

Sim Moh Siong, FX strategist for Bank of Singapore, said it‚Äôs unclear whether Trump‚Äôs comments are a negotiation tactic or constitute a real threat that could lead to a government shutdown. ‚ÄúWe have to think a bit harder about the downside risks of the dollar, especially against the safe havens,‚Äù Sim said. The dollar might dip against safe haven currencies and assets such as the yen, Swiss franc and gold from time to time, until agreements on the budget and raising the debt ceiling are reached, he added.

Analysts said the dollar may lack clear directional bias ahead of a gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that starts later on Thursday. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six currencies, edged up 0.1 percent to 93.259. The focus will be on speeches from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Friday. Yellen may try to prepare markets for the possibility of another Fed rate hike later this year, said Tan Teck Leng, forex analyst at UBS Wealth Management in Singapore.

‚ÄúIf anything I would suppose Yellen would want to recalibrate market expectations, at least to a 50 percent chance,‚Äù Tan said. U.S. interest rate futures are now implying about a 40 percent chance of a Fed rate hike in December. On Thursday, the euro held steady at $1.1803, after having risen about 0.4 percent the previous day. German and French PMI data released on Wednesday showed both countries registering strong private-sector growth in August, helping to support the euro.

After earning a recall to the Australian side, Usman Khawaja is focussed to prove his critics wrong and cement a place for himself in the Australian side. Pacer Mitchell Starc has also backed him to succeed and said that that the hard work he has put in will benefit in the upcoming Test series in Bangladesh. However, after being unable to find a spot for himself in the India series, Usman Khawaja now finds himself in the reckoning for the Bangladesh series and knows how important it is for him to perform.

Speaking to The Unplayable Podcast, Starc said, ‚Äù I think the whole team have copped a bit of stick about how we‚Äôve played spin in the past and maybe ‚ÄòUzzie‚Äô more than most has copped a bit of it. From what I saw in that Indian series he worked a hell of a lot at it and I‚Äôm sure he did in the IPL with a few of the Indian spinners in that team working him around as well.

On the upcoming series in Bangladesh, he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs slightly different over in Bangladesh than it is in India, but I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs going to be well equipped in this series.

Commenting on the morale of the team, Starc said, ‚ÄúObviously being in a such a good position in all four Test matches and losing the series is something we can learn from and be a little bit disappointed about. But the fact we were in commanding positions in all those Tests is also a positive. We can take a lot of confidence out of the way we played those spinners at times but we weren‚Äôt able to win some of the key moments with the bat and with the ball to win that series.

Sri Lanka launches inquiry into recent defeats,"Administrators will brainstorm ideas about how to revive the game in Sri Lanka. Administrators will brainstorm ideas about how to revive the game in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka is launching an investigation into the woeful state of cricket on the island, the sports minister said today, amid a string of humiliating losses and calls for an administrative overhaul.

Dayasiri Jayasekera said he was inviting former administrators, players, sports experts and journalists to brainstorm ideas about how to revive the game, beloved in Sri Lanka.

‚ÄúI am hoping to get all these experts at a single forum and thrash out issues,‚Äù Jayasekera told AFP.

‚ÄúThere is no point in blaming administrators or the players without an in-depth study. The idea is not to apportion blame, but address the deficiencies and rally behind the national team.‚Äù

He has rejected a suggested clear-out of the cricket board, an idea pushed aggressively by former World Cup winning skipper Arjuna Ranatunga following this month‚Äôs 3-0 Test whitewash against India on home soil.

That compounded the misery for the national side after they suffered a humiliating ODI home series defeat against bottom-ranked Zimbabwe and bowed out early from the Champions Trophy in England.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to interfere in the administration,‚Äù Jayasekera said. ‚ÄúThat might lead to isolation by the ICC (International Cricket Council).‚Äù

For years Sri Lanka‚Äôs cricket was governed by state-appointed boards, before a switch in 2016 to democratically-elected office bearers.

Ranatunga, who wanted a key role in the administration, was defeated at those elections.

The ICC had briefly suspended Sri Lanka‚Äôs voting rights before the 2016 reforms.

Jayasekera said player fitness was also an issue that contributed to Sri Lanka‚Äôs poor showing of late. The sports minister had already caused a stir by labelling the squad too fat and unfit to field five-day matches.

It is hoped the proposed forum, which has asked interested parties to submit written submissions about how to improve the game, will be held within a fortnight.

Syed Ali Shah Geelani‚Äôs sons questioned by NIA again,"Senior separatist leader of the hardliner faction of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) Syed Ali Shah Geelani.

For the second time in a fortnight, two sons of pro-Pakistan separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani were today questioned by the NIA in connection with a terror funding probe allegedly involving Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, officials said. Nayeem and Naseem were questioned earlier on August 8. The elder son Nayeem is a surgeon by profession, while Naseem is an employee of the Jammu and Kashmir government.

According to officials, who are not authorised to speak to media, the two were asked to bring certain documents related to financial transactions that have come under the scanner of the NIA. Nayeem is tipped as the natural successor to lead the Tehrek-e-Hurriyat, a separatist conglomerate comprising pro-Pakistan hardline groups, after his 87-year-old ailing father.

The NIA had registered the case of terror funding and named Saeed, leader of the Pakistan-based Jamaat-ud-Dawa and banned terrorist outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba, as an accused. It had registered the case on May 30, accusing separatist and secessionist leaders of being in cahoots with terrorist groups.

The case was registered over raising, receiving and collecting funds through various illegal means, including through hawala channels, for funding separatist and terrorist activities in the state.

The case also included causing disruption in the Valley by pelting security forces with stones, burning schools, damaging public property and waging war against India. It was the first time since the rise of militancy in the early 1990s that a central probe agency conducted raids in connection with the funding of terrorist and separatist groups.

"When A Heist Went South: A bank break-in, 23,000 Rs 10 coins and three clueless robbers","They took 900 coins and spent the money on food and drinks. ‚ÄúAnuj, allegedly a drug addict, managed to get his hands on five packets of high-quality marijuana,‚Äù the officer said. (Illustration by Manila Gosh) They took 900 coins and spent the money on food and drinks. ‚ÄúAnuj, allegedly a drug addict, managed to get his hands on five packets of high-quality marijuana,‚Äù the officer said. (Illustration by Manila Gosh)

It took about 40 minutes for three robbers to break into the Syndicate Bank branch in Mukherjee Nagar, but getting out took over two hours. The three made away with Rs 2.3 lakh ‚Äî but in 23,000 Rs 10 coins, weighing more than 160 kg. Unable to take out all coins at once, they took away just 900 in nine packets and concealed the rest under cement bags on the roof of the bank building.

The three accused ‚Äî two cousins named Rahul and their associate, Anuj ‚Äî were arrested Monday. Investigators who questioned them told The Indian Express they found it impossible to move the coins, packed in 49 polythene packets, and decided to leave 40 on the roof, thinking that nobody would find them.

But when ACP (Model Town) Hukma Ram visited the bank with six officers, they found the hidden stash. It took two officers more than an hour to shift the coins back to the vault room. The two cousins and their associate planned the heist for 40 days. They worked at the BBM depot that houses the bank. ‚ÄúThe cousins are electricians. They spotted a window at the back of the depot, which housed a few abandoned buildings, and found they could enter the bank through it,‚Äù an officer said.

On the night of August 21, they broke in using an electric hand grinder after they managed to connect it to a naked wire at the abandoned building. Four-five motion sensor cameras inside the bank could not track their movements as they were non-functional, a police officer said, adding that the accused also severed the power to cameras.

The accused found two lockers ‚Äî one containing currency notes and another with 23,000 coins. They immediately tried to pry open the locker with the cash, but found it was beyond their expertise. They then broke open the locker with the coins. ‚ÄúThe brothers tried to lift the currency chest but could not move it an inch. They deliberated for a while after which they started moving one packet at a time. Anuj stood watch while the cousins laboured for more than two hours to shift the coins to the back.

They gave up on taking the money home and hid it on the roof, thinking they would come back every day and shift the money in small installments,‚Äù the officer said. They took 900 coins and spent the money on food and drinks. ‚ÄúAnuj, allegedly a drug addict, managed to get his hands on five packets of high-quality marijuana,‚Äù the officer said.

Police said the cousins intended to open a thermocol factory in Ghaziabad‚Äôs Loni with the money. ‚ÄúThe elder one had seen a thermocol machine in his neighbourhood in Loni and was fascinated. He wanted to have his own factory,‚Äù the officer said.

Michael Schumacher‚Äôs son to mark 25th anniversary of Spa win,"Former Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher of Germany. (Source: Reuters) Former Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher of Germany. (Source: Reuters)

Michael Schumacher‚Äôs teenage son Mick will mark the 25th anniversary of the German‚Äôs first Formula One victory by driving demonstration laps in a 1994 Benetton at this weekend‚Äôs Belgian Grand Prix.

Sabine Kehm, a manager for both father and son and spokeswoman for the family, told Reuters on Wednesday that the 18-year-old would be at the wheel before Sunday‚Äôs race at Spa-Francorchamps.

Schumacher, the seven times world champion who suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in France in 2013, took his breakthrough win ‚Äì the first of a record 91 career victories ‚Äì at the circuit on Aug. 30, 1992.

Spa was a special place for the German, who won the 1994 and 1995 crowns with Benetton before five titles in a row with Ferrari from 2000-04.

He retired in 2006 and then made a comeback with Mercedes between 2010-12.

The German made an impressive debut in Belgium with the Jordan team in 1991 and went on to win a record six times at Spa, as well as taking his seventh world championship there in 2004 ‚Äì the only title ever clinched at the circuit.

This weekend‚Äôs Belgian race could also see one of his records equalled, with Mercedes driver and triple world champion Lewis Hamilton needing one pole position to match the German‚Äôs unprecedented 68.

Now 48 years old, the most successful driver in the sport‚Äôs history has not been seen in public since his accident, with the family closely guarding his privacy at their home in Switzerland.

Mick Schumacher is working his way through the junior motor racing series and is currently competing in European Formula Three after a debut in Formula Four.

Kehm said it had not been possible to use a 1992 Benetton for the demonstration, due to mechanical and insurance issues, but the 1994 one was in running order and would be transported to Spa from Cologne on Thursday.

Schumacher‚Äôs private collection of cars, from his boyhood karts to final Mercedes F1 car, is due to go on show at Motorworld Cologne next year.

The permanent collection will also include trophies, racing suits and other memorabilia.

Devendra Fadnavis wants farm loan waiver data submission work expedited,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis

Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday directed officials to take up the task of data submission related to farm loan waiver scheme in a ‚Äòmission mode‚Äô so that its implementation can be expedited. The process of collecting information on farmers eligible for loan waiver should be completed in a ‚Äòmission mode‚Äô, he said.

Fadnavis reviewed the progress of data submission in his office and asked officials concerned to speed up the process. He communicated with the district collectors and chief executive officers of zilla parishads about the issue.

During the meeting, it was revealed that so far the maximum number of farmers who have submitted their forms to seek waiver hail from Jalgaon district. The government has set up centres in different districts to collect information related to eligible beneficiaries. ‚ÄúThe centres uploading farmer details online would get Rs 10 per person. If a centre is found to be charging from farmers for uploading the data, then it will lose its recognition immediately,‚Äù Fadnavis warned.

He also reviewed the current crop status in regions like Marathwada and Vidarbha which had to wait for long to get good showers this monsoon season. The south west monsoon has revived over Maharashtra since the last seven days which is expected to support the kharif crops.

The government on June 24 had announced a Rs 34,000-crore crop loan waiver for the state‚Äôs marginal farmers. Named as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Krushi Sanman Yojana, the scheme is designed to benefit about 89 lakh farmers.

Rajiv Gandhi assassination case: Convict Perarivalan granted 30-day parole,"Perarivalan is one the three male convicts serving life sentence in the high security Central Prison at Vellore, the other two being Murugan and Santhan.(ANI Photo) Perarivalan is one the three male convicts serving life sentence in the high security Central Prison at Vellore, the other two being Murugan and Santhan.(ANI Photo)

The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday granted parole to one of the convicts, A G Perarivalan alias Arivu, in the assassination case of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, for his father‚Äôs medical treatment. Perarivalan, a life convict is expected to be released by tomorrow from Vellore jail.

According to a Home Department order, Perarivalan‚Äôs 30-day ordinary leave was granted following an opinion from the Advocate General. The request for his parole was earlier rejected by the Deputy Inspector General of prison, Vellore Range, stating that he is not eligible for ordinary leave under Rule 22.

However, the Additional Director General of police had remarked among other thing that an ordinary leave can be granted only on the condition that life convict Perarivalan should be provided with strong police escort during the period of leave.

Perarivalan‚Äôs mother Arputham Ammal had earlier requested the Central Prison in Vellore to grant 30 days leave to her son, for the treatment of his father Gnanasekaran. Her request for the parole was also supported by the DMK and other political parties.

Perarivalan is one the three male convicts serving life sentence in the high security Central Prison at Vellore, the other two being Murugan and Santhan. He has been lodged there since 1991 and has spent over 26 years in custody, much more than he has lived outside.

His mother earlier had also filed several petitions with the Chief Minister‚Äôs special cell, seeking the release of her son on parole to meet his aged, bed-ridden father.

"Karti Chidambaram appears before CBI, quizzed for ‚Äòover eight hours‚Äô","Karti Chidambaram (Express photo by Prem Nath Pandey) Karti Chidambaram (Express photo by Prem Nath Pandey)

FORMER UNION minister P Chidambaram‚Äôs son Karti Chidambaram on Wednesday appeared before the CBI and was reportedly questioned for more than eight hours in connection with a case of corruption. While Karti is likely to be examined again on August 28, the Congress on Wednesday called it a case of political vendetta by the BJP-led NDA government. According to sources, Karti was asked more than 100 questions related to dealings of a company associated with him in the INX case. He is said to have arrived at the CBI headquarters around 10.20 am and left around 6.30 pm ‚Äî his appearance was ensured by a Supreme Court order.

The CBI is probing Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to INX Media for FDI during Chidambaram‚Äôs tenure as finance minister. It is alleged that a firm ‚Äúindirectly controlled‚Äù by Karti received money from INX Media, then run by Indrani and Peter Mukerjea.

Calling it ‚Äúnothing except political vendetta of the worst kind‚Äù, senior Congress leader Manish Tewari said, ‚ÄúIt is very surprising that the government goes and registers an FIR against unknown persons with regard to FIPB clearances. Who are those unknown persons? (They were) six seniormost secretaries of the Government of India at that point in time‚Ä¶. If this government has the courage, let them name those unknown persons. The FIPB consisted of the six seniormost secretaries of the Government of India ‚Äî Commerce Secretary, Finance Secretary, Revenue Secretary and three more. They make the recommendations and the minister signs on it.‚Äù

The CBI had registered the case on May 15 against Karti, his company Chess Management Services, INX Media, Advantage Strategic Consulting Services, its director Padma Vishwanathan and the Mukerjeas. The Mukerjeas are in jail in connection with the murder of Indrani‚Äôs daughter Sheena Bora. Chidambaram had responded to the FIR, saying the government was using the CBI and other agencies to target his son. FIPB approval, he had said, was granted in ‚Äúhundreds of cases‚Äù.

Afghan official: Taliban suicide car bombing kills 7 people,"A patrolling U.S. armored vehicle is reflected in the mirror of a car in Kabul, Afghanistan, Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2017.

A Taliban suicide car bomber targeted a military convoy in Afghanistan‚Äôs southern Helmand province on Wednesday, killing at least seven people, a provincial official said. The attack comes just days after President Donald Trump announced his new strategy for Afghanistan, which involves maintaining a US military presence in the country and upending a campaign vow to end America‚Äôs longest war.

According to Omar Zwak, the spokesman for the Helmand provincial governor, Wednesday‚Äôs explosion in Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital, also wounded 42 people, mostly civilians. Initial reports show that those killed included a small girl, two women and four soldiers, Zwak said, expressing fears that the death toll could rise further.

‚ÄúThis is from our initial reports, I am afraid the casualty tolls might change once we get a final report form the attack,‚Äù he added. The bombing took place near the police chief‚Äôs headquarters. Local TV broadcast footage showing several military Humvees, which the Afghan army also uses, destroyed as a result of the attack.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack in a posting on his twitter account.

Senior Afghan government officials on Tuesday welcomed Trump‚Äôs strategy announcement from Monday. Senior US officials said Trump may send up to 3,900 more troops, with some deployments beginning almost immediately.

Trump also had harsh words for Pakistan, accusing Islamabad of giving extremists a safe haven, while next door in Afghanistan they kill US troops. He said he wanted ‚Äúimmediate‚Äù results without saying what actions the United States might take against Pakistan if it ignored his warning.

The United States and Afghanistan have routinely accused Pakistan ‚Äî and particularly its powerful intelligence agency ‚Äî of harboring insurgents and of waging a selective war, attacking those militants Islamabad considers its enemy and allowing those it has been known to use as proxies, either against hostile neighbors India or Afghanistan, to flourish.

Taliban attacks have stepped up all across Afghanistan since the withdrawal of foreign combat forces from the war-torn nation at the end of 2014, and the insurgents have lately been constantly expanding their footprint.

Earlier this month, the Taliban in an ‚Äúopen letter‚Äù to Trump, reiterated their calls for the withdrawal of all remaining US troops. The United States has about 8,400 troops in Afghanistan, who support local forces and carry out counterterrorism operations.

81 injured as Kaifiyat Express derails in UP,"The Delhi-bound train derailed in Auraiya district early on Wednesday. PTI The Delhi-bound train derailed in Auraiya district early on Wednesday. PTI

Three days after the Puri-Haridwar Utkal Express derailed leaving 22 dead in Muzaffarnagar, 12 coaches of the Delhi-bound Kaifiyat Express came off the track as the train hit a dumper in Auraiya district early on Wednesday. A total of 81 people were injured and four of them are reportedly critical. According to Auraiya District Magistrate Jai Prakash Sagar, prima facie it appears that the dumper was carrying sand on the road parallel to the track to a nearby construction site for the Railways‚Äô Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) before it suddenly overturned and fell on the track. Nine coaches derailed and one of them overturned following the accident, Sagar said.

However, North Central Railway‚Äôs Chief PRO GK Bansal said that 12 coaches derailed after the train hit an unauthorised dumper that was trying to cross the track. Bansal denied that the dumper was carrying sand for the construction of a DFC. The driver escaped the spot. Bansal claimed that 48 people were injured and no one was seriously injured as per their record.

However, officials said that among the 81 injured, four are receiving treatment at the Saifai PGI in Etawah district and the others have been admitted at hospitals in Auraiya and Kanpur. Forty-three passengers with minor injuries were discharged after being administered first aid. Sagar said a railway official informed him about the accident near Acchalda railway station over the phone early morning after which other district officials rushed to the spot. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ it seems the dumper overturned on the road parallel to the railway track. The vehicle‚Äôs left portion covered the track and the train engine hit it, causing the derailment,‚Äù he said. The dumper was carrying sand for construction of the DFC two kilometres from the spot, he added.

NDRF personnel from Lucknow and other officials carried out the rescue work. The injured were sent to hospital while the others were sent to Kanpur railway station by bus, officials said. However, CPRO Bansal said a MEMU train from Shikohabad was sent to Achhalda railway station to carry the passengers to Ferozabad‚Äôs Tundla railway station from where a special train took them to Delhi. Four general, five AC and two sleeper coaches derailed while a sleeping cum luggage rake overturned after the accident, Bansal said, adding that 40 trains on the route were diverted after the mishap.

Auraiya SP Sanjeev Tyagi said that efforts are being made to trace the absconding driver of the dumper which is registered in the name of one Sahab Singh of Haryana. Police have sought help from the Haryana Police for further details, Tyagi said.

Yu Kobayashi double puts Kawasaki Frontale in charge in Asian Champions League quarters,"Yu Kobayashi scored twice as Kawasaki Frontale secured a 3-1 win over fellow Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds in the first leg of their Asian Champions League quarter-final meeting on Wednesday evening.

Kobayashi claimed a goal in each half, either side of a volley by Elsinho, to give Toru Oniki‚Äôs side the upper hand ahead of the second leg at Saitama Stadium in three weeks.

Yuki Muto claimed an away goal for Urawa before Kobayashi‚Äôs second five minutes from time to secure a lifeline for the 2007 champions as the J-League pair battle for a place in the last four.

Kawasaki or Urawa will take on Chinese opposition in the next round, with Shanghai SIPG handing Guangzhou Evergrande a 4-0 thrashing in the first leg of their quarter-final on Tuesday evening.

‚ÄúThe players worked hard from the back to the front and did a fantastic job to get the third goal after Reds made it 2-1,‚Äù said Oniki.

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not over yet and we are only at halftime. We have to make sure we keep our focus going into the second leg.‚Äù

Kobayashi put Kawasaki in front 12 minutes before the break after Kengo Nakamura had unlocked the Urawa defence. In the 62nd minute, the home side doubled their advantage as Elsinho scored from close range.

Muto pulled one back for Urawa 14 minutes from time when he controlled Takuya Aoki‚Äôs ball on his chest before slotting under Kawasaki goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryung, but the home side restored their two-goal cushion nine minutes later when Kobayashi headed in Akihiro Ienaga‚Äôs cross.

‚ÄúFrontale are a team that can keep the ball and we knew we had to be patient,‚Äù said Urawa manager Takafumi Hori.

‚ÄúThey had a lot of time on the ball and at the end we couldn‚Äôt handle them defensively.‚Äù

Meanwhile, in the west of the continent, Iran‚Äôs Persepolis fought back from going two goals behind to draw 2-2 with Al Ahli of Saudi Arabia.

Goals from Omar Al Soma and Leonardo put the Jeddah-based side two goals up before the hour mark but Shoja Khalilzadeh and Godwin Mensha struck to give the Iranians hope of progressing to the semi-finals.

Related News US judge orders more environmental analysis of Dakota pipeline

Energy Transfer Partners LP on Tuesday sued Greenpeace and other environmental groups, accusing them of launching an ‚Äúeco-terrorism‚Äù campaign aimed at blocking the Dakota Access Pipeline, the center of months of opposition by Native American and green groups. The pipeline operator said Greenpeace, Earth First and other organizations engaged in ‚Äúacts of terrorism‚Äù to solicit donations and interfere with its pipeline construction activities, damaging its ‚Äúcritical business and financial relationships.‚Äù

ETP said the groups‚Äô actions and negative publicity against it, its sister company Energy Transfer Equity LP and other firms caused billions of dollars in damages. Greenpeace USA General Counsel Tom Wetterer said the company‚Äôs lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in Bismarck, North Dakota, ‚Äúabuse(d) the legal system to silence legitimate advocacy work.‚Äù

In May the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline began interstate crude oil delivery, but a federal appeals court judge in June ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reconsider its environmental review of the line, opening up the possibility that the line could be shut at a later date.

In its 231-page filing, Energy Transfer accused Greenpeace and groups like Bank Track and the Bold Alliance of ‚Äúmanufacturing a media spectacle‚Äù around Dakota Access pipeline opposition. The company said environmentalists approached the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, the public face of the months-long fight against the pipeline, and used it to wage a battle against the project.

ETP said environmental groups ‚Äúcynically planted radical, violent eco-terrorists on the ground amongst the protesters, and directly funded their operations and publicly urged their supporters to do the same.‚Äù Energy Transfer is being represented by the Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman law firm, whose founding partner Marc Kasowitz is President Donald Trump‚Äôs lawyer.

Greenpeace said this is the second time Kasowitz‚Äôs firm has gone after the group. Last year it represented Resolute Forest Products in a defamation lawsuit brought by the global logging company against Greenpeace. Wetterer said that ‚Äúcomplaint repackages spurious allegations and legal claims.‚Äù The case is Energy Transfer Equity LP v. Greenpeace International, 17-cv-173, U.S. District Court, District of North Dakota (Bismark).

Oral steroids ineffective for chest infections in adults,"It is important to minimise the usage of heavy steroids as regular use may lead to several side effects. (Source: File Photo) It is important to minimise the usage of heavy steroids as regular use may lead to several side effects. (Source: File Photo)

Oral steroids should not be used for treating acute lower respiratory tract infection or chest infections in adults who don‚Äôt have asthma or other chronic lung disease as they do not reduce the duration or severity of symptoms, according to a new study.

‚ÄúOral and inhaled steroids are known to be highly effective in treating acute asthma as well as infective flares of other long-term lung conditions but need to be used carefully because of the risk of unwanted side effects,‚Äù said Michael Moore, Professor at the University of Southampton in the UK.

For the study, published in the journal JAMA, the team looked at 398 non-asthmatic adults with acute chest infections ‚Äî but no evidence of pneumonia and not requiring immediate antibiotic treatment ‚Äî who were randomly split into two groups, one receiving 40 mg of the oral steroid ‚Äúprednisolone‚Äù for five days and one receiving a placebo over the same time period.

‚ÄúWe have conclusively demonstrated steroids are not effective in patients with the symptoms of chest infections, such as shortness of breath, wheeze and cough with phlegm that overlap with acute asthma,‚Äù Moore added. Moore said that alternative methods of treating chest infections should be found to reduce the amount of antibiotics being used to combat anti-microbial resistance, which is considered a global health crisis.

It does not look as if steroids are the answer, he said. ‚ÄúMore needs to be done to find alternative treatments to antibiotics if we are to get ahead of antibiotic resistance, which is increasing at an alarming rate. Herbal remedies could have a potential role to play,‚Äù Moore noted.

Maria Sharapova determined to prove point on Grand Slam return,"Maria Sharapova will make her first Grand Slam appearance next week. Maria Sharapova will make her first Grand Slam appearance next week.

Former world number one Maria Sharapova makes her first Grand Slam appearance next week since serving a 15-month doping suspension, bringing renewed passion and resolve to the US Open.

The 30-year-old Russian was given a wildcard into the tournament by the US Tennis Association (USTA), a move critics complained about earlier in the season but another key step in the road back for the five-time Grand Slam winner.

‚ÄúWhen it comes to tennis, good or bad ‚Äî there‚Äôs really only one thing that I know for certain ‚Äî I‚Äôve missed it,‚Äù Sharapova wrote on the Players‚Äô Tribune website.

‚ÄúThough these last two years have been tougher ‚Äî so much tougher ‚Äî than I ever could have anticipated‚Ä¶ my passion for the game has never wavered. If anything, it has only grown stronger.‚Äù

Sharapova was issued a two-year suspension after testing positive for the banned heart and blood boosting drug meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced the ban on appeal.

She said that she had taken it for several years and did not know it had been placed on the banned list at the start of 2016.

Sharapova made her return in April at Stuttgart, reaching the semi-finals as a wildcard, but such invitations sparked criticism from some WTA rivals, saying she should have to work her way back without such benefits, some suggesting a life ban.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm aware of what many of my peers have said about me and how critical of me some of them have been,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a human being with a normal, beating heart‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think that sort of thing will ever fully be possible to ignore.‚Äù

Sharapova was refused a wildcard by French Open organizers and missed Wimbledon with a thigh injury, so the US Open will be her first Grand Slam event since last year‚Äôs Australian Open.

Shaking off criticism after the French Open snub, Sharapova tweeted, ‚ÄúIf this is what it takes to rise up again, then I am in it all the way, everyday. No words, games or actions will ever stop me from reaching my own dreams. And I have many.‚Äù

Sharapova has missed three of the past four US Opens, her last visit ending in the 2014 fourth round.

The USTA defended its wildcard offer, saying, ‚ÄúHer suspension under the terms of the tennis anti-doping program was completed and therefore was not one of the factors weighed in our wildcard selection process.‚Äù

‚ÄúConsistent with past practice, a wildcard was provided to a past US champion who needed the wildcard for entry into the main draw.‚Äù

Former world number one Sharapova won the 2006 US Open as well as Wimbledon in 2004, the 2008 Australian Open and the 2012 and 2014 French Opens.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure this is a great moment for her to have an opportunity to be back to a place where she has done so well,‚Äù seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams said.

Sharapova was bolstered by fans with ‚ÄúWelcome back Maria‚Äù signs in Germany and cheering support last month in Stanford, her first US match in more than two years.

‚ÄúI feel like I just want to hug everyone and say thank you,‚Äù Sharapova said.

Sharapova defeated American Jennifer Brady 6-1, 4-6, 6-0 in her Stanford opener but suffered a left forearm injury and has not played competitively since.

‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm playing catch-up against everyone who has had a head start,‚Äù she said of being hurt during US Open tuneup events.

Targetting Pakistan for its safe harbour to terrorism over the years, Trump said that America needs to change its approach in dealing with Pakistan, ‚ÄúWe cannot be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe heaven for terror groups.‚Äù He was addressing Army troops at Fort Myer.

Calling himself a ‚Äúproblem solver‚Äù, Trump said that he inherited a ‚Äúbad and very complex hand.‚Äù Acting completely opposite to his views as expressed during the presidential campaign of pulling out from Afghanistan which was an unsolvable quagmire, Trump said that the decision to pull off might create a vacuum that terrorist organisations like Al-Qaeda and ISIS could instant fill just as happened before September 11. Attacking former president Barack Obama for pulling out ‚Äúhastily‚Äù from Iraq, Trump said that due to those policies Iraq ‚Äúslipped back into the hands of terrorists, enemies, and we cannot repeat in Afghanistan our leaders made in Iraq.‚Äù He added, Working alongside our allies we will break their will, dry up their recruitment, keep them from crossing our border, yes we will defeat them.‚Äù

Without revealing the number of troops to remain stationed in Afghanistan or figures of new deployment in the mountainous country, Trump said, ‚ÄúWe will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities, conditions on ground not arbitrary time table will guide our strategy.‚Äù

The Makhanlal Chaturvedi National University of Journalism and Mass Communication will run a ‚Äògau shala‚Äô at their new 50-acre campus in Bhopal, news agency ANI reported. Deepak Sharma, Registrar of the university, called it a ‚Äúnew experiment‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äògau shala‚Äô will be constructed on around two acre land,‚Äù ANI quoted him as saying.

Sharma said the plan didn‚Äôt need permission from UGC, a commission to regulate higher education in India. This move comes at a time when the scientist community is showing concern over government‚Äôs focus on promoting benefits of cow dung, cow urine, milk, curd and ghee for alleged medicinal properties.

At the March for Science rally, Aniket Sule, astrophysicist attached with Homi Bhabha Center for Science Education said, ‚ÄúThe rally is not just to demand more funds for science. It is time scientists come together to speak about the shift we are seeing in government funds for research in cow urine. If we don‚Äôt speak now, people will believe in validation of cow urine without evidence.‚Äù

Students of Government Degree College in south Kashmir‚Äôs Anantnag disrupted a cricket match organised by J&K Police on Wednesday, as they thought that the Tricolour would be hoisted on their campus. Following this, the students also clashed with the police and set a podium and tents on fire. A cricket match was being held at the high-security playground of Government Degree College in Khanabal, Anantnag, on Wednesday morning. The college students suddenly entered the playground and started hurling stones at the policemen guarding the venue.

As the police fired tear smoke shells and tried to disperse them, more students joined in. They also set the podium on fire and burnt down some tents set up by the police on the playground. The cricket match is part of the sports festival organised by the J&K Police in every district of the Valley. Police had chosen the Degree College playground as the venue as it falls under a high-security zone.

A student of the college told The Indian Express that the students were enraged as they thought that the police are planning to unfurl the Tricolour on the ground. A professor of the college said the clashes started almost half-an-hour after the match had started. ‚ÄúThe police showed restraint and used mild force‚Äù. Anantnag SSP Altaf Khan said, ‚ÄúSince the tents were synthetic, they immediately caught fire.‚Äù

Southgate has also called up uncapped goalkeeper Jordan Pickford of Everton.

Cane dues at Rs 2K crore-plus even after 5 months of Yogi Adityanath govt,"‚ÄòThe ruling party in its manifesto, however, promised to make this law applicable only from the next season. And now, they aren‚Äôt implementing even the promise of clearing all pending dues within 120 days of government.‚Äô (Source: Express photo/Vishal Srivastav) ‚ÄòThe ruling party in its manifesto, however, promised to make this law applicable only from the next season. And now, they aren‚Äôt implementing even the promise of clearing all pending dues within 120 days of government.‚Äô (Source: Express photo/Vishal Srivastav)

More than five months after the Yogi Adityanath government assumed office, sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh (UP) are still to pay farmers over Rs 2,000 crore against past cane purchases. This, despite the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in its 2017 UP election manifesto promising to clear all pending dues of growers within 120 days of coming to power, and ensuring future payments in less than 14 days of cane supply.

Latest available data from the Cane Commissioner‚Äôs Office in Lucknow shows that UP mills have, as on August 22, paid only Rs 23,442.94 crore out of the Rs 25,386.77 crore worth of crop bought at the official state advised price (SAP) during the 2016-17 sugar season. Adding the unpaid dues of Rs 48.87 crore and Rs 29.91 crore from the preceding two seasons takes the total arrears ‚Äî exclusive of any interest on delayed payments ‚Äî to well over Rs 2,000 crore.

Out of the Rs 1,943.82 crore cane arrears for the current season ‚Äî which technically runs from October to September, although crushing operations ended by early May ‚Äî a major chunk is accounted for by just three groups, namely Bajaj Hindusthan (Rs 779.35 crore), U K Modi (Rs 390.93 crore) and Simbhaoli Sugars Ltd (Rs 140.30 crore).

Other private sector groups/companies with cane dues to growers in the 2016-17 season include Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises Ltd (Rs 70.12 crore), Mawana Sugars (Rs 58.04 crore), Rana Sugars (Rs 33.44 crore), Gobind Sugar Mills (Rs 29.13 crore), Nawabganj Sugar Mills (Rs 21.71 crore), Kanoria Sugar (Rs 10.95 crore) and Yadu Sugar (Rs 10.16 crore).

Significantly, 19 mills belonging to the UP Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation ‚Äî effectively controlled by the state government ‚Äî also have outstanding cane dues of Rs 398.98 crore. On the other hand, the likes of Balrampur Chini Mills, Triveni Engineering, Dhampur Sugar Mills, K K Birla Group, DCM Shriram Ltd, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, Dalmia Bharat Sugars, Uttam Sugar, Indian Potash Ltd, Daurala Sugar Works and Wave Group have discharged their entire cane payments.

The defaulting mills are concentrated mainly in Lakhimpur Kheri (Rs 314.68 crore), Baghpat (Rs 314.59 crore), Meerut (Rs 215.75 crore) and Shamli (Rs 133.13 crore). The last one incidentally happens to be the home district of UP‚Äôs Minister of State for Cane Development and Sugar Mills, Suresh Rana.

‚ÄúTechnically, the law (UP Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Act, 1953) requires mills to pay us the SAP within 14 days of cane delivery, with any delay beyond this period attracting interest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum. The ruling party in its manifesto, however, promised to make this law applicable only from the next season. And now, they aren‚Äôt implementing even the promise of clearing all pending dues within 120 days of government formation, which took place on March 19,‚Äù said Jitender Singh Hooda, a nine-acre grower from Kheri Bairagi village in Shamli district.

Stephen Constantine‚Äôs men look to make it 10 wins in a row,"Indian football team coach Stephen Constantine and captain Sandesh Jhingan during a press conference in Mumbai. (Source: PTI) Indian football team coach Stephen Constantine and captain Sandesh Jhingan during a press conference in Mumbai. (Source: PTI)

In their final preparatory match before next month‚Äôs Asian Cup qualifier against Macau, India will take on Caribbean side St. Kitts and Nevis, who are ranked 125th in the world. India coach Stephen Constantine is expected to give a few more young players an opportunity before finalising his squad for the Macau match, which will be played on September 5.

On a nine-match unbeaten run, India defeated Mauritius 2-1 in the opening match of the tri-series here, a match in which forwards Robin Singh and Balwant Singh scored a goal each. Coach Constantine handed debuts to Balwant, goalkeeper Amrinder Singh, Nikhil Pujary and Manvir Singh in that game and is expected to continue his policy on Thursday as well.

The Indian defence comprising the likes of Sandesh Jhinghan, would play a crucial role in the absence of first-choice goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, who will join the team later this month along with Sunil Chhetri. The duo is currently in Bengaluru, discharging their club duties. ‚ÄúWe have tendency to start slow and that sometimes causes problem as it did with Mauritius. They got the first goal, even Puerto Rico (in an international friendly last year) got the first goal. We need to come out little bit quicker, that is one of the key areas. Defence is obviously is one of the key areas,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSt. Kitts and Nevis did a good job in containing Mauritius. They (St. Kitts and Nevis) are quite dangerous especially on the counter attack and you could see in the goal against Mauritius),‚Äù he said.

St Kitts and Nevis, who were held by a lower-ranked Mauritius to a 1-1 draw, would like to put up an inspired show against the favourites. Their coach Jacques Passy also conceded that India are a formidable side compared to them despite the absence of several first-team players. ‚ÄúThey (India) are absolute favourites to win the tournament. It is no more a three-nation, but a two-nation tournament. Our focus is on India,‚Äù Passy said.

Mexico human rights official says slain reporter wasn‚Äôt target,"Blood stains the ground on a gas station where the reporter of the Diario de Acayucan, Candido Rios Vazquez, was murdered in Hueyapan de Ocampo, Veracruz state, Mexico. Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2017. (AP Photo) Blood stains the ground on a gas station where the reporter of the Diario de Acayucan, Candido Rios Vazquez, was murdered in Hueyapan de Ocampo, Veracruz state, Mexico. Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2017. (AP Photo)

The assailants who killed a crime reporter in the Mexican Gulf coast state of Veracruz appeared to be targeting two other people also slain in the attack, not the journalist, the country‚Äôs top human rights official said Wednesday. The Interior Department‚Äôs deputy secretary for human rights, Roberto Campa, said the initial investigation suggests Candido Rios Vazquez of the newspaper Diario de Acayucan was not the attackers‚Äô target. He did not provide any additional details.

‚ÄúAll indications point toward this being an attack against another person and that person‚Äôs bodyguards,‚Äù Campa said during a visit to Veracruz‚Äôs capital.

Mexican officials have often been quick to point to motives other than reporting in the killings of journalists and Campa‚Äôs comments outraged Rios Vazquez‚Äôs colleagues, who said the journalist had been repeatedly threatened by a former mayor since 2012.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre worse than the bullets that killed Candido,‚Äù the slain reporter‚Äôs editor, Cecilio Perez Cortes, said of Campa‚Äôs remarks.

Perez said it was ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù of Campa to make such a public conclusion less than 24 hours after the crime without any proof. ‚ÄúImplicitly he‚Äôs freeing the killers from blame,‚Äù the editor said.

Campa is one of the officials who oversee the federal government‚Äôs so-called mechanism to protect journalists and human rights workers. He confirmed that Rios Vazquez had been enrolled in the program since 2013 due to threats from a municipal official. He said Rios Vazquez‚Äôs case had been reviewed in recent months and that his home was outfitted with six surveillance cameras and he had a panic button.

The attack that occurred Tuesday afternoon in front of a gas station on a rural highway was not the sort of risk that authorities had evaluated for Rios Vazquez, he said.

‚ÄúWe have to do an analysis and self-criticism about the effectiveness of the measures,‚Äù Campa said.

Hilda Nieves Martinez, Rios Vazquez‚Äôs wife, confirmed Wednesday that her husband had been threatened for years by a former mayor of Hueyapan. Men had been sent to beat him up and they had threatened to cut out his tongue and eyes. He had gone to Mexico City to tell authorities about all of it, she said.

Perez said that his reporter had just messaged him and was headed home around 3 p.m. He had stopped along the road to speak with a former police inspector he knew when they were attacked. The inspector was also killed along with a third person.

The National Human Rights Commission said Rios Vazquez was the ninth journalist slain so far this year in Mexico. It called for a thorough investigation and for officials to provide protection for his family.

U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Roberta Jacobson said Wednesday via Twitter that she was dismayed by Rios Vazquez‚Äôs murder. ‚ÄúTogether we defend and respect freedom of the press,‚Äù she wrote.

The front page of Wednesday‚Äôs Diario de Acayucan featured a large photograph of Rios Vazquez below the headline: ‚ÄúThey will not silence us.‚Äù

Dozens killed in airstrikes on Syrian city of Raqqa,"The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces now hold more than half of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremist group‚Äôs self-styled Islamic caliphate. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces now hold more than half of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremist group‚Äôs self-styled Islamic caliphate.

Syrian state media and opposition activists said on Tuesday that airstrikes on the northern city of Raqqa have killed dozens of civilians. US-backed Syrian opposition fighters have been trying to capture the city from the Islamic State group since June 6, and have been fighting under the cover of airstrikes by the US-led coalition.

The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces now hold more than half of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremist group‚Äôs self-styled Islamic caliphate. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said airstrikes in Raqqa on Monday killed 42 civilians, including 19 children and 12 women. The activist-run group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said 32 people were killed in airstrikes on one neighborhood alone.

Syrian state media said the airstrikes killed dozens. They all blamed the US-led coalition. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said humanitarian staff in Syria are ‚Äúdeeply concerned by unconfirmed reports of a high number of civilians killed by airstrikes in Raqqa City over the last 24 hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúThese attacks, if confirmed, are a shocking reminder that civilians continue to bear the brunt of the conflict in many parts of Syria,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIn recent days and weeks, scores of civilians have been killed and injured in Raqqa due to airstrikes and shelling, and up to 25,000 people remain trapped in the city,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄòUN focus is on finding political solution to current crisis in Afghanistan‚Äô,"UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. (File/Photo) UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. (File/Photo)

The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hopes that the international community will come together and help Afghanistan find a political solution after President Donald Trump unveiled his military strategy in the war-torn country. Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to the nation as commander-in-chief on Monday ruled out a hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to end America‚Äôs longest war.

‚ÄúOn the President‚Äôs speech‚Ä¶ what we want to stress is our hope that the international community will help come together and help Afghanistan find a political solution that will bring peace to the country,‚Äù UN chief‚Äôs spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs also obviously through the support and efforts of the UN, of the UN Mission there,‚Äù Dujarric added.

Dujarric was responding to a question on whether the Secretary-General had any comment on Trump‚Äôs Afghanistan speech.

When asked if there is any consideration on providing the good offices of the Secretary-General to help facilitate on a diplomatic efforts with Pakistan in terms of ending sanctuaries for terrorists, Dujarric said ‚Äúas a matter of principle, Secretary-General‚Äôs good offices are always available to any two parties who, who ask. But that is just a statement of principle.‚Äù

Dujarric added that the UN‚Äôs focus is on ‚Äúfinding a political solution to the current crisis in Afghanistan‚Äù and help the Afghan people who have suffered so much for decades.

Ruling out a hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, Trump had issued the sternest warning yet by an American leader to Pakistan for providing safe havens to terrorists and sought an enhanced role for India in bringing peace in the war-ravaged country.

‚ÄúFor its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and terror. The threat is worse because Pakistan and India are two nuclear-armed states whose tense relations threaten to spiral into conflict. And that could happen,‚Äù Trump had said.

The US President slammed Pakistan for its continued support to terrorist groups and warned Islamabad of consequences if it continues to do so.

‚ÄúWe can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúPakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists,‚Äù he said, in a warning to Pakistan.

"It‚Äôs more difficult to bat at number three than playing as an opener, says Imrul Kayes","Imrul Kayes will play against Australia in upcoming two-match Test series. (Source: AP) Imrul Kayes will play against Australia in upcoming two-match Test series. (Source: AP)

Bangladesh will face Australia in a two-match Test series at home which is scheduled to begin from Sunday. The hosts are looking to make few changes in their batting line up and batsman Imrul Kayes might have to come in at number three position and talking about the same Kayes has said that he needs to adjust as he is more comfortable while playing as an opener than at three.

‚ÄúI think it is more difficult to bat at number three than playing as an opener,‚Äù Imrul told reporters on Tuesday (August 22). ‚ÄúBut I have to adjust with that. I batted at number three in the last Test match I played in Sri Lanka. I have talked with the coach and he told me to bat at number three. I have been batting in the nets keeping that in mind,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúI think the team management has a plan and that‚Äôs why I am at number three. Soumya has done a lot better at the opening position in the last few matches,‚Äù he said.

Kayes did admit that he is more comfortable as an opener but suggested that he would be ready to do whatever his team requires.

‚ÄúI become very impatient to go to the field when I pad up for batting in the dressing room. Eventually, I have to adjust. If you tell Tamim to do similar kind of stuff, he won‚Äôt be able to do that. Once I could not do that, but I have to do it now for the sake of team‚Äôs requirement. I have to do whatever the team wants from me. I feel that I can bat in both positions either in number three or as an opener; I am ready to accept it,‚Äù Kayes told.

Talking about facing new ball, the batsman suggested when you bat at number three, bowlers become cautious and they control their line and length by the time

‚ÄúThere are both benefits and difficulties in facing the new ball. Bowlers don‚Äôt know about the strengths of a batsman, batsmen also don‚Äôt know what the bowlers can do. But when you bat at number three, bowlers become cautious and they control their line and length by the time,‚Äù he said.

Speaking about the choices that Bangladesh selectors now have, he said that it is a positive sign for Bangladesh cricket.

‚ÄúIt is a positive sign. It is really great for Bangladesh cricket to have a healthy competition in the team,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTeam management can pick the best player if there is a competition around. I think it is very good for us and players will perform as well,‚Äù he added.

Though he accepted that he is more comfortable as an opener, Kayes looked confident about facing the Aussie pace attack.

‚ÄúI have been playing international cricket for the last seven to eight years. I have played against South Africa and England as well. They also have the best pace attack. I survived against them, so I don‚Äôt think it will be difficult for me; I think I can play against the Aussie pace attack as well,‚Äù he said.

Social media culture promotes risky posts: Study,"With smart phones and easy internet access it has become easy for people to share objectionable content on social media (Source: File Photo) With smart phones and easy internet access it has become easy for people to share objectionable content on social media (Source: File Photo)

If you thought young people posting content on social media that contains sexual or offensive material were just being impulsive, think again! A new study says that such risky posts might be a deliberate strategy to fit in with the wider social media culture.

Young adults think it is the best way to behave, said lead researcher Claire White from University of Plymouth in England. To measure risky online self-presentation, the research team designed a risk exposure scale relating to potentially inappropriate images or texts, such as drug and alcohol use, sexual content, personal information, and offensive material.

They also evaluated people‚Äôs level of self-monitoring and impulsivity. ‚ÄúThe results show that high self-monitors are just as likely to post risky content as those in the study who are more impulsive, which suggests they think it‚Äôs not only OK to be risky ‚Äî and potentially offensive ‚Äî but that it‚Äôs actually the right thing to do,‚Äù White said.

For the study, published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behaviour, and Social Networking, 178 British and Italian participants were recruited to complete an online questionnaire. All were undergraduate students, who received course credit for their participation.

‚ÄúThe only notable difference between the nationalities was that British students were more likely to post comments and images related to their alcohol and drug use on social media, whereas their Italian counterparts were more likely to post offensive content and personal information,‚Äù White said.

‚ÄúThis difference shows that culture as a whole seems to play a part in what type of content is shared. But the fact that the behaviours predicting risky online choices are the same for both nationalities suggests there‚Äôs a wider social media culture that encourages this type of risk-taking behaviour,‚Äù White added.

"Keeping Shankersinh Vaghela in Congress was a big mistake, says Ashok Gehlot","Former Congress leader. (File) Former Congress leader. (File)

Gujarat Congress in-charge Ashok Gehlot on Thursday tore into former party leader Shankersinh Vaghela and accused him of ‚Äúbetraying‚Äù the party at the behest of the ruling BJP. Gehlot said it was a mistake to keep Vaghela in the Congress for two decades. Addressing Youth Congress workers at a function here, Gehlot lashed out at Vaghela for ‚Äúorchestrating‚Äù cross-voting during the recent Rajya Sabha polls and triggering defection of MLAs. He said Vaghela was acting as per the instructions of the ruling BJP.

‚ÄúWe now realise that it was a big mistake to keep Vaghela in the party for the last 20 years. We not only gave him respect, but also made him Union minister, president of the state unit and also the leader of opposition in the Gujarat Assembly,‚Äù he said.

Gehlot said Vaghela had assured that he will work as a ‚Äúdisciplined soldier‚Äù of the Congress when he joined the party 20 years ago.

‚ÄúWhen he joined Congress 20 years ago, he gave an assurance that he will never leave the party. But, he didn‚Äôt keep his word and betrayed the party,‚Äù the former Rajasthan chief minister said.

Gehlot claimed Vaghela had deliberately laid ‚Äúimpractical conditions‚Äù ahead of the August 8 Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat ‚Äúso as to take forward the agenda of the BJP‚Äù.

Vaghela had said that he would extend his support to Congress candidate Ahmed Patel only if Gehlot takes back the ‚Äúallegations‚Äù that Vaghela had quit the party because the BJP was blackmailing him in the name of CBI.

‚ÄúVaghela knew that Congress will never accept his demands. He was only rehearsing the script given to him by the BJP. Though he had promised to vote Patel, he reneged on his own words. It reflected his double standards,‚Äù Gehlot said.

Commenting on the exodus of 14 MLAs of Congress in poll-bound Gujarat, including Vaghela, Gehlot said he was more than happy to get rid of such ‚Äúcorrupt and opportunist‚Äù people.

‚ÄúIt will not make any difference to the party. Since Vaghela is not in Congress now, he will try to harm our party during the Assembly polls. But, I am confident that Congress will win power this time,‚Äù he said.

Speaking on the occasion, state unit Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki announced that party vice-president Rahul Gandhi may visit a function of elected representatives of local bodies on September 4.

Vaghela (77), a Kshatriya strongman, had last month announced his decision to quit the Congress. The former RSS volunteer had also clarified that he was not going back to the BJP.

He had headed the Rashtriya Janata Party (RJP) government in Gujarat in 1996, before merging his party with the Congress.

Maharashtra: Loan wavier to roll out from October 1,"Farmers in Maharashtra have restarted their agitation 62 days after they called off their first 11-day strike for a loan waiver. (Representational image) Farmers in Maharashtra have restarted their agitation 62 days after they called off their first 11-day strike for a loan waiver. (Representational image)

September promises to be a good month for the farmers in Maharashtra as the state government is looking to roll out the loan waiver amounts directly into their bank accounts from October 1. Minister of Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh announced in Pune that September 15 would be the last date for filling online applications form.

Back in June, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had announced a Rs 34,000 crore loan waiver for farmers in the state. This announcement was made in the backdrop of the unprecedented farmer‚Äôs strike that Maharashtra had seen in the first week of June. As per the scheme, individual farmers would have Rs 1.5 lakh waived off from their outstanding loans while regular payees would get 25 per cent rebate or Rs 25,000 in their accounts. However, technical issues and frequent changes in the nature of the scheme had till date stopped the loan waiver from being implemented.

Deshumuk said September 15 would be the last date to fill the online forms and scrutiny of the claims will be done in the next 15 days. ‚ÄúWe hope the farmers will get the waiver from October 1 onwards in their accounts,‚Äù he said. The minister went on to add that the deadlines can be relaxed in case of eligible farmers.

Responding to complaints of technical issues being faced by farmers while filing the forms and also of complaints of Mahaeseva Kendras allegedly demanding money to fill in the form, Deshmukh said all complaints will be dealt with seriously. ‚ÄúThe collectors have been instructed to the deal with each and complaints seriously,‚Äù he said. Till date 25 lakh farmers in the state have filled the form online.

"If convicted, Samsung‚Äôs Lee could be c/o Uijeongbu Prison","In the event, then, of an upheld conviction, Lee would likely follow a route to Uijeongbu Prison taken previously by a former prime minister and the heads of the SK and Daesang conglomerates, among others. REUTERS/Cho Seong-joon/Pool In the event, then, of an upheld conviction, Lee would likely follow a route to Uijeongbu Prison taken previously by a former prime minister and the heads of the SK and Daesang conglomerates, among others. REUTERS/Cho Seong-joon/Pool

* Lower court verdict for Lee on Friday

* Any appeal likely to go to Supreme Court next year ‚Äì experts

* Previous high-profile inmates served time at Uijeongbu jail

* Some manual work, study, scope for lots of meetings

If convicted and given a jail sentence, home for Jay Y. Lee, the billionaire de facto head of South Korean conglomerate Samsung, could be a crowded prison set in wooded hills just to the north of Seoul, where disgraced politicians and business leaders have previously served time.

Lee, who has been tried on charges ranging from bribery to perjury in a scandal that triggered the dismissal from office of the country‚Äôs ex-president Park Geun-hye, will hear the verdict of a lower court on Friday. Prosecutors are seeking a 12-year jail term. The 49-year-old Samsung scion denies wrongdoing, and would almost certainly appeal any conviction, with his case likely to be fast-tracked to the Supreme Court for a final ruling, probably next year.

In the event, then, of an upheld conviction, Lee would likely follow a route to Uijeongbu Prison taken previously by a former prime minister and the heads of the SK and Daesang conglomerates, among others.

If sent to Uijeongbu, Lee would likely be held in a single cell, equipped with a TV, shelving, coat rack and electric fan. Prisoners are expected to work ‚Äì tending the flower garden is seen as a popular choice, said a prison official, who didn‚Äôt want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media ‚Äì and he would be allowed to exercise outdoors for an hour a day.

They can also take up study courses in English or Japanese, and attend religious services. Chey Tae-won, the convicted SK chairman, dedicated a book he published while at the prison ‚Äúto the Lord‚Äù.

Lawyers said white-collar crime inmates often reduce their manual work time by having ‚Äúspecial meetings‚Äù with visitors, which can be granted at the discretion of the prison warden.

Directing operations at Samsung Electronics, the world‚Äôs leading smartphone and memory chip maker, from prison, though, would be a challenge as most visits are restricted. Previous conglomerate, or chaebol, heads relied on leadership committees to mind the shop while they served their sentences.

For now, pending this week‚Äôs lower court verdict, Lee remains in the Seoul Detention Centre where, since February, home has been a 6.56 square meter (71 square foot) cell, with a partitioned toilet. Meals are simple, normally rice and side-dishes, and cheap, costing 1,443 won ($1.26).

The centre, in a Seoul suburb near apartments built by Samsung C&T and stores advertising Samsung Electronics‚Äô smartphones, is the country‚Äôs third-most crowded correctional facility.

A justice ministry official told Reuters that Lee could ask to be transferred ‚Äì possibly to the newer 12-floor Seoul Eastern Detention Centre, which local media say has basketball courts, elevators and wall-mounted flat-screen TVs. A former top aide to ex-president Park, on trial for corruption, recently moved to the new Seoul facility.

While preparing the lengthy appeal process, previous high-profile inmates have hired so-called ‚Äòbutler lawyers‚Äô, who stay with detained clients for hours a day to get them out of their cells and into the more comfortable visitors‚Äô rooms.

Justice ministry data show SK chairman Chey had more than 1,600 meetings with his lawyers during his 17-month detention in 2013-14 ‚Äì more than three meetings every day.

Nepal Parliament fails to endorse Constitution amendment bill,"Representational Image Representational Image

Nepal‚Äôs parliament on Monday failed to endorse the much-awaited Constitution amendment bill to address the issues of Madhesis as the ruling coalition could not garner a two-thirds majority required for its passage. In the 592-member House, 395 votes were required to get the amendment bill through. During the voting, 347 lawmakers voted in favour of the bill while 206 lawmakers voted against it. Of the total 592 lawmakers, 553 lawmakers were present during the voting.

The main opposition, CPN UML, voted against the bill. Rastriya Prajatantra Party led by Kamal Thapa, a pro-Hindu group, had also voted against the bill. The voting process commenced after the 50 proposals to amend the bill registered by various political parties were rejected by a majority.

Earlier, a total of 54 lawmakers took part in the deliberations of the bill that was forwarded to address demands raised by the agitating Madhes-centric parties who have been opposing the local elections on the ground that the new Constitution be amended to accommodate their views. They want more representation in the Parliament and redrawing of provincial boundaries.

Madhesis, mostly of Indian-origin, launched a prolonged agitation between September 2015 and February last year against the implementation of the new Constitution which they felt marginalised the Terai community.

"‚ÄòSo lucky, you know‚Ä¶ I will be first engineering graduate from my tribe‚Äô","C Kalyani (left) and roommate R Soumika on the JNTU campus. Sreenivas Janyala C Kalyani (left) and roommate R Soumika on the JNTU campus. Sreenivas Janyala

There is a spring in C Kalyani‚Äôs step as she walks out of the girls‚Äô hostel on the sprawling, leafy campus of Jawaharlal Nehru Technology University (JNTU) at Sulthanpur in Telangana. It is her first day in college. The diminutive girl is the first from her vanishing community, the Primitive Tribal Group (PTG) Thoti, to go to an engineering college.

‚ÄúI cannot believe that I am here on this huge and beautiful campus and such a great college. I am so lucky, you know? It is a dream come true,‚Äù she says. She arrived at the campus earlier this month to complete the formalities for joining. ‚ÄúThis is the first time I am staying so far away from home. It is a six-hour drive to my home from here,‚Äù says Kalyani, who belongs to Dubarpet in Adilabad district.

‚ÄúI am happier because my roommate happens to be a friend from the tribal coaching centre,‚Äù she says. Her roommate, R Soumika, is from the Lambada community and has joined electronics and communications engineering. Kalyani, who aims to become a scientist, has opted for material science and nanotechnology engineering. She is eagerly waiting for classes to start.

‚ÄúEspecially maths, I love it,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI like the regimen here. Breakfast is at 8 am at the dining hall, then it‚Äôs back to room to get ready to go to classes at 10. At 1:30 we will break for lunch and go back at 2 and study again till 4:30. Then, back to the room. I am loving it already.‚Äù Fighting against various odds including poverty in their communities,Kalyani and Soumika made it up to Intermediate, then were selected for coaching for JEE and Engineering Agricultural Medical Common Entrance Test (Eamcet) along with 28 other tribal students at Telangana‚Äôs tribal students‚Äô welfare residential schools in Adilabad district under a special coaching programme called Star-30. The tribal students cracked JEE Main, JEE Advanced (for IITs) or Eamcet to secure admission to top engineering colleges.

Kalyani says her father C Krishna, a labourer, struggled to send her to school. ‚ÄúHe wept for joy when I told him I had made it to engineering college. No girl in my tribe has studied beyond class V. Boys drop out after X. But I insisted I want to study and my father struggled hard to pay school fees and buy books,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI will be the first engineering graduate from my community. My brother is in second year Intermediate and sister is in VII. I did not get much time to prepare for JEE but I passed Eamcet. I am lucky to get admission to a top college like JNTU.‚Äô‚Äô

At a time when populations of forest-dwelling tribal communities are dwindling across the country, seven boys and girls from three primitive and vanishing tribes of Telangana created history this year by becoming the first from their communities to join engineering colleges ‚Äì Pujari Adharsh, Pudari Srinivas, P Pavan Kalyan, M Pushpalatha from the PTG Manne community, and K Ramatha and A Parmeshwar from PTG Kolam, besides Kalyani from PTG Thoti. Counselling ended last fortnight. In another first, two boys from the Lambada community got admissions in IIT Varanasi and VNIT Nagpur.

Mancherial district collector R V Karnan, Adilabad DC Dr Jyothi Buddha Prakash, and in-charge Anura Jayanthi were given Telangana Excellence Awards on Independence Day for the project Star-30. Less than 2,000 people each of the three PTG groups live in Telangana. Most of them live in tribal hamlets on the periphery of forests in Adilabad and Karimnagar districts. Literacy levels are very low and most of them work as farm labour.

Last Tuesday, Adharsh joined JNTU at Karimnagar, opting for information technology. He ranked 2594th in JEE in the ST category. Hailing from Ippalaguda, a tribal settlement in Kouthala mandal of the newly created Komaram Bheem Asifabad district, Adharsh made it through extreme poverty. His father P Buchaiah, who used to work as a farm labourer, was paralysed three years ago and remains bedridden now while his mother Sharada now works for daily wages.

‚ÄúAfter I passed JEE, someone gave me a cheque for Rs 10,000. I added another Rs 500 and paid the fees of Rs 10,500 at JNTU. I borrowed another Rs 5,000 and paid hostel fees,‚Äù Adharsh says. ‚ÄúWhen I started from my village to go to college, my mother had just Rs 100 which she gave me for bus fare. I am hoping the government will reimburse the fees and I will be able to pay fees next year.‚Äù

In his community, few study beyond class X. ‚ÄúGirls drop out after V. Until I joined special coaching camp, I did not know about IIT or Eamcet,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere were many reasons including severe financial hardships for me, too, to drop out. It was constant encouragement from my teachers and Mancherial district collector and ITDA project officer R V Karnan that I made it this far,‚Äô‚Äô he said.

Pavan Kalyan‚Äôs parents work as labourers in Kompalle village in Mancherial district. ‚ÄúMy maths teacher in junior college told me about the coaching camp for tribal students started by Karnan. Until then I did not know about IIT,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI could not clear it but cracked Eamcet because of the coaching. I got admission at CMR College of Engineering and Technology, Hyderabad,‚Äù he says.

Srinivas, also of the Manne tribal group like Adharsh and Pavan, cleared JEE Advanced. He wants to start an IT start-up company after his engineering. ‚ÄúAs soon as I make some money, I want to adopt my village Nambal in Komaram Bheem Asifabad district and set up schools and a college. I want to arrange free coaching to my village students to compete in all-India entrance tests,‚Äù he says. Srinivas has joined electronics and communication engineering in Arjun College of Science and Technology. His father P Ganesh works as a farm labourer.

Ramatha is the first woman from her Kolam community to get admission in an engineering college. Her brother Jyotiram became the first man to go to college when he got a seat in B Ed recently. Ramatha got a seat at Kakatiya Institute of Technology and Science for Women at Nizamabad on Monday. Hailing from Arkapur village in Nizamabad district, her father Atram Abhiman, a poor farmer, was in a quandary initially. ‚ÄúI can pay fees for only one of them. I don‚Äôt have enough money to send both my son and daughter to college. I am very happy that my daughter has been offered a seat in a top engineering college, and she is the first in our small community, but I may not be able to afford the fees,‚Äù Abhiman says. A week later, he borrowed and paid for Ramatha‚Äôs fees.

‚ÄúThere are only 2,000 people of my tribal community left in,‚Äù Ramatha says. ‚ÄúMost of them still live in hamlets in forests or on the periphery, mostly working as farm labour. They do not know anything about engineering or medical colleges or IIT or EAMCET. Their life just revolves around ensuring one proper meal a day. The coaching given to students in tribal schools will change the lives of tribal students for ever. I want to complete my computer science engineering course.‚Äù S Bujangarao of the Gond community got admission at VNIT at Nagpur in metallurgical and materials science engineering after becoming the first Gond to clear JEE. Although three students from the Lambada community cracked JEE last year, this year Badavath Rajender secured a better rank and went to VNIT.

France‚Äôs Macron says ‚Äòposted worker‚Äô rules betray EU spirit,"FILE PHOTO French President Emmanuel Macron waits for a guest at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, June 28, 2017.

Picture taken June 28, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo

French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday decried European rules allowing firms in low-wage countries to post workers elsewhere as a ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù of the European spirit, seeking to overcome eastern European resistance to curbing the practice. Macron has pledged to overhaul a system under which ‚Äúposted‚Äù workers can be sent to other European Union states on contracts that must guarantee the host country‚Äôs minimum wage, but under which taxes and social charges are paid in the home nation.

He says the system creates unfair competition in wealthier nations. Macron is pushing for the duration of these contracts to be limited to one year rather than two under a new European Commission proposal, and to reinforce measures to ensure the rules are obeyed.

‚ÄúThe single European market and the free movement of workers is not meant to create a race to the bottom in terms of social regulations,‚Äù Macron told reporters after meeting Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, who he said was in full agreement. Macron is on a three-day tour of central and eastern Europe, hoping to make progress on an issue over which Western nations and poorer eastern European states have been at odds for years.

He and Kern were due to meet the prime ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovakia ‚Äì two low-wage eastern countries ‚Äì later on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe posted workers‚Äô directive as it currently functions is a betrayal of the European spirit in its essence,‚Äù Macron said.

He also said France and Austria shared the same views on the need to harmonise fiscal rules, build up a common European investment capacity and a euro zone budget that would be voted through by a euro zone parliament. ‚ÄúAll of this encourages us to move forward with a new initiative to relaunch Europe before the end of the year,‚Äù he said, an ambitious project given impetus in part by Britain‚Äôs shock vote last year to leave the EU.

Hong Kong shuts down as powerful typhoon sweeps past,"Hato was skirting south of Hong Kong and was expected to make landfall in China‚Äôs Guangdong province. Thousands of people were evacuated from parts of the mainland coast ahead of the storm‚Äôs arrival, China‚Äôs official Xinhua News Agency reported. Hato was skirting south of Hong Kong and was expected to make landfall in China‚Äôs Guangdong province. Thousands of people were evacuated from parts of the mainland coast ahead of the storm‚Äôs arrival, China‚Äôs official Xinhua News Agency reported.

A powerful typhoon barreled into Hong Kong on Wednesday, forcing offices and schools to close and leaving flooded streets, shattered windows and hundreds of canceled flights in its wake.

Typhoon Hato came within 60 kilometers (37 miles) of Hong Kong, close enough to be considered a direct hit under Hong Kong‚Äôs storm warning system. It was headed toward the western side of mainland China‚Äôs Pearl River Delta.

Weather authorities raised the No. 10 hurricane signal, the highest level, for the first time in five years.

By midday, Hato was packing maximum sustained winds of 126 kilometers (78 miles) per hour, with gusts of up to 207 kph (129 mph) on some outlying islands.

The warning forced businesses, government offices, schools and courts to shut and the stock market to suspend trading, leaving the Asian financial center‚Äôs normally bustling streets eerily quiet. Airlines canceled 450 flights and ferry operators halted commuter services and routes to the nearby Chinese gambling center of Macau and cities in the delta.

Hato‚Äôs fierce gales brought down trees, overturned trash cans and blew out windows on skyscrapers, raining shattered glass onto the streets below.

The No. 10 signal has only been hoisted 14 other times since 1946, or one for every 72 storms, according to the Hong Kong Observatory. The last time it went up was for Typhoon Vicente in 2012.

The observatory warned residents to be prepared for destructive winds, possible flooding and landslips, and advised people to stay away from low-lying areas because storm surges could cause severe flooding. Streets and village laneways in areas near the sea were submerged by waves crashing ashore, according to local TV news footage.

Hato was skirting south of Hong Kong and was expected to make landfall in China‚Äôs Guangdong province. Thousands of people were evacuated from parts of the mainland coast ahead of the storm‚Äôs arrival, China‚Äôs official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Train services were canceled, fishing boats returned to harbor and more than 4,000 fish farmers and their families came to shore, Xinhua said. Waves up to 10 meters (33 feet) high were expected in the South China Sea, the agency said.

Aadhaar-PAN linkage to continue: UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey,"Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act entails requirement of the 12-digit unique number for availing government benefits or services and that ‚Äúcontinues‚Äù, Ajay Bhushan said. Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act entails requirement of the 12-digit unique number for availing government benefits or services and that ‚Äúcontinues‚Äù, Ajay Bhushan said.

Linking of PAN with biometric identifier Aadhaar will continue as previously directed and so will quoting of the 12-digit ID number for availing various government subsidies, UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey said on Thursday. The Supreme Court verdict holding privacy as a fundamental right has in no way stopped quoting of Aadhaar for various schemes as well as filing of income tax returns, Pandey said.

The Aadhaar Act ‚Äî which entails its quoting for services ranging from getting subsidised cooking gas to opening bank account and obtaining a new phone number ‚Äî had been drafted keeping in mind privacy as a fundamental right, he said. ‚ÄúWe are very confident the Act will pass the test of privacy being a fundamental right,‚Äù Pandey told PTI.

Thursday‚Äôs Supreme Court ‚Äújudgement has not said anything about the Aadhaar Act so the Aadhaar Act is a valid Act passed by the Parliament (and) is the law of the land,‚Äù he said. Section 7 of the act ‚Äúprescribes that for getting certain subsidy or benefit the government can insist on an Aadhaar number. That position holds today,‚Äù he added.

Asked if anyone can refuse to give their details in the backdrop of today‚Äôs order, he said, ‚ÄúAs of today, no. Because Aadhaar Act is a valid Act and this judgement has not commented anything on Aadhaar Act.‚Äù

Pandey said Aadhaar enrolment will continue unhindered. On the linking of Aadhaar with Permanent Account Number (PAN) alloted to income tax payers, he said such a linkage has been mandated by an amendment to the Income Tax Act. The ‚Äúlinking will continue under that Act and law. There is no change in that,‚Äù he said.

Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act entails requirement of the 12-digit unique number for availing government benefits or services and that ‚Äúcontinues‚Äù, he said adding the deadlines prescribed for such linkages would continue to be valid as well. ‚ÄúThose deadlines have been prescribed in pursuance of provisions in Aadhaar Act or Income Tax Act or money laundering rules. Since those laws are valid therefore those deadlines will also have to be adhered to,‚Äù he said.

The UIDAI CEO added that Aadhaar Act protects privacy of people as a fundamental right and its provisions provide for safeguarding of personal data and how such data can be used. ‚ÄúThe data will not be shared without the consent of the person. So there are number of privacy protection provisions inbuilt into the Aadhaar Act itself,‚Äù he said.

He noted that ‚Äúcore biometric can never be shared with anyone for any reason whatsoever, except in particular circumstances which too has to be cleared by a committee headed by cabinet secretary‚Äù.

"Donald Trump‚Äôs harsh words for Pakistan reflects US government‚Äôs frustration, says former AS Nisha Desai Biswal","President Donald Trump speaks at Fort Myer in Arlington during a Presidential Address to the Nation. (Source: Reuters) President Donald Trump speaks at Fort Myer in Arlington during a Presidential Address to the Nation. (Source: Reuters)

President Donald Trump‚Äôs harsh words for Pakistan while announcing his Afghanistan and South Asia strategy reflects the growing frustration within the US government over Islamabad‚Äôs continued support for cross-border terrorism, a former American diplomat said. Trump, in his first prime-time televised address to the nation as commander-in-chief, warned Pakistan of consequences for providing safe havens to terrorists and sought an enhanced role for India to bring peace in the war-torn country. He ruled out a hasty withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to end America‚Äôs longest war. ‚ÄúPresident Trump tonight presented the nation with his strategy for Afghanistan ‚Äî a strategy that largely continued the approach of the previous administration, with a few key distinctions,‚Äù former Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia in the Obama administration Nisha Desai Biswal.

‚ÄúFirst let me say ‚Äî the most dramatic shifts were not in US policy towards Afghanistan but in the attitude of the president himself‚Äîgoing from the withdrawal he had advocated during the campaign to essentially continuing, and even augmenting the troop levels for the foreseeable future,‚Äù she told PTI. In announcing the strategy, she said Trump acknowledged the potential vacuum, and instability that would result from a precipitous withdrawal. ‚ÄúContinued US presence at current or near current levels,while not enough to stabilise Afghanistan, can at least keep it from collapsing entirely. The president‚Äôs announcement will provide some reassurances to the region which feared a US vacuum,‚Äù she said. Biswal said Trump seemed to focus almost entirely on the counter-terrorism mission, again pointing to a narrow mission aimed not at building a stable and viable Afghanistan but merely on preventing deterioration and preventing threats to the American homeland.

‚ÄúA military strategy without an accompanying diplomatic and development strategy can at best be a band-aid to stop the bleeding but it will not address the underlying problems. To be fair, the two prior administrations also failed to successfully address the underlying challenges,‚Äù she said. The president‚Äôs harsh language for Pakistan reflect the‚Äùgrowing frustration‚Äù within the US government ‚Äîincluding in military and intelligence circles‚Äîwith Pakistan‚Äôs continued support for terror groups carrying out attacks in Afghanistan and India and its diminishing cooperation with the US, Biswal said. ‚ÄúWhile the tougher stance may be warranted, I have not seen high-level diplomatic engagement to manage there actions,‚Äù said the former top American diplomat.

The president also prioritised India as a partner that can play a larger role, she said. ‚ÄúWhile India has provided significant economic assistance to Afghanistan, it has not played a larger political or military role. That has largely been a mutually supported decision ‚Äî the US, sensitive to Pakistani reactions, did not want Indian boots on the ground, and India for its part also did not want to put its troops into Afghanistan,‚Äù she noted. However, with the US patience with Pakistan wearing thinner by the day, there is less heed being paid to Pakistan sensitivities and a greater expectation that India, with much at stake, should take on a greater share of the burden, Biswal said. And there is much India can do, without taking on a kinetic role. It can provide training and equipment to the Afghan military and provide more substantial support for the Afghan trust fund, she said.

‚ÄúWhile many will take issue with the president‚Äôs blunt language linking trade and burden sharing, I already seee fforts by State and Department of Defence to soften the approach to India,‚Äù she said. However, for Afghanistan to be successful, stable and economically viable, there must be a robust regional diplomatic strategy, she added.

John McEnroe expects more Roger Federer magic at U.S. Open,"It was only the third time Roger Federer had lost a match this year. (Source: AP) It was only the third time Roger Federer had lost a match this year. (Source: AP)

American great John McEnroe expects Roger Federer‚Äôs sensational comeback season to continue in New York when the U.S. Open kicks off on Monday.

Since returning from a six-month hiatus in January, the 36-year-old Swiss has been in stupendous form as he has won five titles, including the Australian Open and Wimbledon.

‚ÄúAt the moment we‚Äôre just assuming that Roger is going to pull the rabbit out of the hat again,‚Äù four-times U.S. Open champion McEnroe said during an ESPN conference call on Wednesday.

‚ÄúIf Roger wins this, it will be one of the great stories in that last 50 years or ever. I saw him today and I said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve got to tell you, hats off. I‚Äôve watched tennis for 40 or 50 years and I‚Äôve never seen anything like this‚Äô.‚Äù

Chris Evert, the winner of 18 grand slam titles, said she was equally mesmerized by what Federer has done this year. ‚ÄúHe came back and it was ridiculous,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was like he was a different person. It was like his clone has come back,‚Äù she said.

One question mark hanging over Federer is his health. Back pain appeared to limit his mobility during the Rogers Cup final in Montreal earlier this month, where he fell in straight sets to 20-year-old German Alexander Zverev.

It was only the third time Federer had lost a match this year and as a result the 19-times grand slam champion opted to skip the Cincinnati Masters to tend to the injury.

‚ÄúI was sitting on the court in Montreal when he tweaked his lower back and it was really evident that something was wrong with him,‚Äù Evert said.

‚ÄúYou never know, he doesn‚Äôt say much about his injuries and he made no excuses after the match, but hopefully he‚Äôs healthy.‚Äù Federer will need to be at 100 percent to compete at Flushing Meadows in the gruelling best-of-five-set tournament, where scorching heat and suffocating humidity are the norm.

Apart from Federer, world number one Rafael Nadal and Briton Andy Murray, who is coming back from a hip injury that forced him to skip all the hardcourt tournaments in the run up to the Open, are the names in the mix as potential winners of the final major of the season. If those favorites falter, the tournament is up for grabs, McEnroe said.

‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be shocking considering that Roger is 36 and he‚Äôs had two majors already so perhaps things don‚Äôt go as smoothly as they did the other times. And let‚Äôs say Nadal wasn‚Äôt around and Murray wasn‚Äôt healthy, then it‚Äôs like, who is going to do it?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where it really gets open,‚Äù he said.

"No longer an also-ran, British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn hits campaign trail","Britain‚Äôs Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. (Source: AP) Britain‚Äôs Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. (Source: AP)

British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn is back on the campaign trail just weeks after losing an election, betting that Prime Minister Theresa May‚Äôs minority government will soon collapse. Long written off by opponents and many members of his Labour Party as an old-fashioned socialist incapable of winning power, Corbyn has been galvanized by the June election, in which Labour made

gains and May‚Äôs Conservatives lost their majority.

With May‚Äôs authority severely dented and the Conservatives struggling to unite over Brexit, he has ordered his party to hit the campaign trail as other parties spend the summer regrouping.

There is no sign yet that Corbyn will get the early election he is betting on. But business leaders who once wrote him off now take his challenge seriously and former Prime Minister Tony Blair, a big critic, says Corbyn could one day lead Britain.

‚ÄúThis government thinks it is there for some time to come,‚Äù Corbyn, 68, told hundreds of people at a rally this month in Pool, a village outside Redruth, a former mining town in a deprived area of southwestern England.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got news for them: we are touring the whole country this summer,‚Äù he said at the site of a former mine.

Seeking a head-start if there is a new election, Labour has identified 100 constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales which it believes it can win from the Conservatives, including seats held by lawmakers such as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.

Corbyn, who plans to visit about 50 of the target areas himself, has been wooing the crowds by attacking the Conservatives over cutbacks in public services and denouncing a political system which he says favours the rich.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the largest campaign Labour has ever embarked upon outside of a general election in the modern era,‚Äù said Ian Lavery, Party Chair and National Campaign co-coordinator.

‚ÄúWe want to build on the campaigning momentum from the general election to build support in marginal constituencies to take us into government.‚Äù

GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN

To be sure, the next election is not due until 2022, and the Conservatives will do all they can to ensure they do not gift Corbyn a chance to win power.

The most likely cause of a new election would be the government being torn apart by divisions over Brexit or the Conservatives deposing May, who has to rely on a small Northern Irish party to

ensure she can pass legislation.

Senior Conservatives appear at least for now to have put off any attempt to replace May because it would risk triggering an election, and are trying to rally together over Brexit.

Opinion polls show support for Corbyn and Labour is rising, despite the party‚Äôs third successive election defeat.

A survey by YouGov polling group in July showed 33 percent of respondents thought Corbyn would make the best prime minister, compared to only 14 percent in January. May‚Äôs own rating fell from 47 percent to 36 percent in the same period.

Another YouGov poll this month gave Labour an 8 percentage point lead over the Conservatives. In April, the Conservatives led by 20 points in some surveys.

Momentum, a grassroots campaigning organisation made up of Corbyn supporters, has led the rallying cry, training activists to go door-to-door to ‚Äúchange minds‚Äù and using social media to boost support for the white-haired leader.

Labour managed in June not only to bring out young voters, many of them taking revenge on May over her Brexit policies, but also won back some left-wing voters who abandoned the party when it moved closer to the centre under the pro-business Blair.

‚ÄúThis is the rebirth of left-wing politics in Britain. It‚Äôs marvellous,‚Äù Dawn Evans, 62, who founded the local Momentum group, said at the rally outside Redruth.

Others, young and old alike, simply see Corbyn as more sincere than other politicians.

‚ÄúHis personality has got a lot to do with it. Because he‚Äôs got a very good, open way of explaining his policies and I also think he actually sees what people want, what the country is looking for,‚Äù Chris Hunter, 59, said at the same rally.

CRITICS

In a sign that the City, London‚Äôs financial hub, is now taking Corbyn‚Äôs leadership credentials more seriously, top finance executives ‚Äî including from Standard Chartered and the London Stock Exchange ‚Äî have held meetings with Labour in the past few weeks to find out more about its policies.

Until recently, bankers had largely ignored the party since Corbyn took over as its leader in 2015.

Some bankers are alarmed by Labour policies and Corbyn has many other critics ‚Äî he survived a leadership challenge inside Labour only a year ago.

The Conservatives‚Äô setbacks in June also showed it is not always easy turning a big opinion poll lead into votes. In an election, Corbyn would have to address many voters‚Äô doubts that he could run the economy, would be tough on security and could guide Britain safely through Brexit.

Brexit divides Labour, as it does the Conservatives, and features little in Corbyn‚Äôs campaign speeches. Voters‚Äô uncertainty over his Brexit stance could also be a problem for him: he voted against joining Europe in a 1975 referendum but campaigned to Remain in 2016, though he was accused by some Labour members of making only a token effort to sway voters.

Blair has said that a combination of Brexit and a Corbyn government would leave Britain ‚Äúflat on our back‚Äù though he told the BBC after the June election that it was now possible Corbyn could be elected prime minister on a left-wing platform.

"Trump was a ‚Äòcreep‚Äô during our presidential debates, made my ‚Äòskin crawl‚Äô: Hillary Clinton","US President Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during US presidential campaigning. (Source: File Photo) US President Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during US presidential campaigning. (Source: File Photo)

Hillary Clinton on Wednesday called US President Donald Trump a ‚Äúcreep‚Äù in her new book, saying he made her ‚Äúskin crawl‚Äù at a debate during their bitter presidential campaigns. She says Trump made her feel ‚Äúincredibly uncomfortable‚Äù and was breathing down her neck, while pacing behind her. Both candidates traded insults during the 2016 vicious campaign, and President Trump still uses the nickname ‚ÄúCrooked Hillary‚Äù to describe the former first lady.

Reading an extract from her forthcoming book ‚ÄòWhat Happened‚Äô on US news network MSNBC, the 69-year-old former US secretary of state said she did not know how to react as they took to the stage for their second presidential debate last October. ‚ÄúDo you stay calm, keep smiling, and carry on as if he weren‚Äôt repeatedly invading your space? Or do you turn, look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly: ‚ÄòBack up you creep, get away from me. I know you love to intimidate women, but you can‚Äôt intimidate me, so back up.'‚Äù

The debate took place just days after a 2005 recording was made public, in which Trump bragged of grabbing women by their genitals and getting away with it because of his status. After an uproar, Trump, 71, apologised and dismissed the conversation as ‚Äúlocker-room talk‚Äù. In her forthcoming book, Clinton says this made her feel even more uncomfortable on the night. ‚ÄúThis is not OK, I thought,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúIt was the second presidential debate and Donald Trump was looming behind me. Two days before, the world heard him brag about groping

women,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúNow we were on a small stage and no matter where I walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces,‚Äù Clinton says. She says she chose to respond by gripping her microphone tightly, but she sometimes wonders if she should have told Trump to back off. ‚ÄúIt certainly would have been better TV,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off [‚Ä¶] Maybe I have overlearned the lesson of staying calm, biting my tongue, digging my fingernails into a clenched fist, smiling all the while, determined to present a composed face to the world,‚Äù she adds.

US puts more pressure on Pakistan to help with Afghan war,"U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, U.S., August 21, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer, Virginia, U.S., August 21, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

The United States suggested on Tuesday it could cut U.S. aid to Pakistan or downgrade Islamabad‚Äôs status as a major non-NATO ally to pressure the South Asian nation to do more to help it with the war in Afghanistan. A day after President Donald Trump committed to an open-ended conflict in Afghanistan and singled out Pakistan for harboring Afghan Taliban insurgents and other militants, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington‚Äôs relationship with Pakistan would depend on its help against terrorism.

‚ÄúWe are going to be conditioning our support for Pakistan and our relationship with them on them delivering results in this area,‚Äù Tillerson told reporters.

U.S. officials are frustrated by what they see as Pakistan‚Äôs reluctance to act against groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network that they believe exploit safe haven on Pakistani soil to launch attacks on neighboring Afghanistan.

Pakistan denies it harbors militants fighting U.S. and Afghan government forces in Afghanistan.

Tillerson said the United States could consider withdrawing Pakistan‚Äôs status as a major non-NATO ally, which provides limited benefits such as giving Pakistan faster access to surplus U.S. military hardware, if cooperation did not improve.

‚ÄúWe have some leverage that‚Äôs been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them, their status as non-NATO alliance partner ‚Äì all of that can be put on the table,‚Äù he said.

In a televised speech on Monday offering few specifics, Trump promised a stepped-up military campaign against Taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the U.S.-backed Afghan government and he singled out Pakistan for harboring militants.

U.S.-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban‚Äôs hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington that year.

U.S. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three American presidents. About 2,400 U.S. troops have died there in America‚Äôs longest military conflict.

The Afghan government welcomed Trump‚Äôs speech, but the Taliban said it would make the country a ‚Äúgraveyard for the American empire.‚Äù

Successive U.S. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear-armed Pakistan, which has a porous border with Afghanistan. Washington fumes about inaction against the Taliban, but Pakistan has cooperated on other U.S. counterterrorism efforts, including against al Qaeda and Islamic State militants.

The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said it was ‚Äúdisappointing that the US policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation‚Äù in fighting terrorism.

‚ÄúAs a matter of policy, Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country,‚Äù it said.

A senior U.S. official said on Tuesday significant measures were under consideration, including possibly sanctioning Pakistani officials with ties to extremist organizations.

INDIA FACTOR

Trump also called for Pakistan‚Äôs great rival India to play a bigger role in Afghanistan, a prospect that will ring alarm bells for Pakistan‚Äôs generals.

‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs policy of engaging India and threatening action may actually constrain Pakistan and lead to the opposite of what he wants,‚Äù said Zahid Hussain, a Pakistani security analyst.

The United States has little choice but to use Pakistani roads and air corridors to resupply its troops in landlocked Afghanistan, giving Islamabad considerable leverage. U.S. officials fret that if Pakistan becomes an active foe, it could further destabilize Afghanistan and endanger U.S. soldiers.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday he was awaiting a plan from the U.S. military‚Äôs chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, before deciding how many more troops to send to Afghanistan.

‚ÄúWhen he brings that to me, I will determine how many more we need to send in,‚Äù Mattis told reporters in Baghdad. ‚ÄúIt may or may not be the number that is bandied about.‚Äù

U.S. officials have said Trump has given Mattis authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to add to the roughly 8,400 already in Afghanistan.

The U.S. Air Force may intensify its strikes in Afghanistan and expand training of the Afghan air force following Trump‚Äôs decision, its top general told Reuters on Tuesday.

Most U.S. troops in Afghanistan work with a NATO-led training and advising mission, with the rest part of a counterterrorism force that mostly targets pockets of al Qaeda and Islamic State fighters.

Justin Trudeau warns ‚Äòno short-cutting‚Äô in Canada‚Äôs asylum process,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said there is no advantage for asylum seekers who evade border checkpoints to cross into the country from the United States. His comments were aimed at curbing a surge in migrants entering Quebec province on foot from the United States this summer.

‚ÄúCanada is an open and welcoming society because Canadians have confidence in our immigration system and have confidence that we are a country based on laws,‚Äù Trudeau told a press conference. ‚ÄúYou will not be at an advantage if you choose to enter Canada irregularly. You must follow the rules and there are many,‚Äù he said.

After meeting with Quebec officials, Trudeau also announced the creation of a task force to deal with the irregular migration through backwoods and farmers‚Äô fields. He said the recent arrivals are going through a rigorous screening process and that there is no ‚Äúshort-cutting.‚Äù

Earlier, the opposition Conservatives criticised the government‚Äôs handling of what it called a migrant ‚Äúcrisis,‚Äù accusing Trudeau of having encouraged the asylum seekers when he said in a January message: ‚ÄúTo all those fleeing persecution, terror and war, Canadians will welcome you.‚Äù

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel said the Twitter message gave ‚Äúfalse hope to people crossing the border‚Äù and has created a massive backlog in processing asylum claims. More than 6,000 people have skirted border checkpoints to enter Canada since the start of July. Overwhelmed by these numbers, the government has increased patrols along the border and added immigration staff to process claims.

The military, meanwhile, has set up tent cities in Quebec and Ontario to house the asylum seekers, after an Olympic stadium and other facilities in Montreal filled up. Most of the recent arrivals are Haitians who face expulsion from the United States after President Donald Trump said that he would not extend temporary asylum granted to 60,000 Haitians affected by a devastating 2010 earthquake. Their special status is due to expire at the end of the year.

"Torso found in Copenhagen waters is missing journalist from submarine, Danish police say","A photo of Swedish journalist Kim Wall who was aboard a submarine ‚ÄúUC3 Nautilus‚Äù before it sank. TT NEWS AGENCY/ Tom Wall Handout via REUTERS A photo of Swedish journalist Kim Wall who was aboard a submarine ‚ÄúUC3 Nautilus‚Äù before it sank. TT NEWS AGENCY/ Tom Wall Handout via REUTERS

Danish police on Wednesday identified a headless female torso found in the Copenhagen waterside as that of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, who police believe was killed on a home-made submarine.

‚ÄúDNA match between torso and Kim Wall,‚Äù the police said on Twitter, declining to comment further until a press briefing at 0700 GMT.

Danish inventor Peter Madsen, charged with killing Wall on his home-made submarine, told the court she had died in an accident and that he ‚Äúburied‚Äù her at sea, changing his previous statement that he dropped her off alive in Copenhagen.

The body was found on Monday by a passing cyclist and police said then it was too early to identify the body which was missing its head, legs and arms.

The case has been followed closely by Danish and Swedish media and has drawn interest from around the world.

Madsen has been charged with manslaughter of Wall who has been missing since he took her out to sea in his 17-metre submarine on August 10. He denies the charge.

He was rescued a day after his UC3 Nautilus sank. Police found nobody else on the vessel.

Danish and Swedish maritime authorities used divers, sonar and helicopters in the search for the body in Koge Bay, south of the city, and in the Oresund Strait between the two countries.

Madsen, an entrepreneur, artist, submarine builder and aerospace engineer, appeared before a judge on August 12 for preliminary questioning. The case is not open to the public to protect further investigations, police said.

"US defence chief in Turkey for talks on Syria, Kurds","Mattis met yesterday with Iraqi Kurdish leader Massud Barzani in Erbil to express US opposition to the referendum. Mattis met yesterday with Iraqi Kurdish leader Massud Barzani in Erbil to express US opposition to the referendum.

Pentagon chief Jim Mattis arrived in Ankara today for talks with Turkish leaders expected to focus on Washington‚Äôs arming of a Syrian Kurdish militia, which Turkey views as a terror group, in the fight against Islamic State.

Mattis flew in for the one-day visit after stopping in Iraq to review progress in the campaign against IS militants, where he urged coalition partners to prevent other political issues from disrupting the growing momentum against the jihadists.

In Ankara, he will hold talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Defence Minister Nurettin Canikli.

Turkey, an important NATO ally of the United States and part of the coalition against IS, is incensed that Washington has been arming the Kurdish Peoples‚Äô Protection Units (YPG) militias in the assault on the jihadists‚Äô stronghold Raqa, in northern Syria.

Turkey regards the YPG as the Syrian affiliate of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK).

In May, the Pentagon said it had begun transferring small arms and vehicles to the YPG to support their role as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-Syrian Arab alliance fighting IS.

The weapons include AK-47s and small-calibre machine guns.

The SDF is currently leading the assault on Raqa, with artillery and air support from US-led coalition forces.

US officials yesterday said the grinding fight was the ‚Äúpriority‚Äù in the counter-IS campaign since the fall of Mosul last month, the jihadists‚Äô Iraqi hub.

The Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq ‚Äî which is also playing a key role in the fight against IS ‚Äî is planning its own independence referendum in September.

Mattis met yesterday with Iraqi Kurdish leader Massud Barzani in Erbil to express US opposition to the referendum.

On the same day, Erdogan vowed Turkey would thwart any attempt by the YPG and its political wing the Democratic Union Party (PYD) to carve out a Kurdish state in northern Syria.

‚ÄúWe do not and will never allow a so-called state to be established by the PYD, YPG in northern Syria,‚Äù Erdogan said.

The US is also concerned about warming ties between Iran and Turkey. Iranian armed forces chief General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri visited Turkey last week.

Erdogan on Monday said a joint operation with Iran against Kurdish militants which ‚Äúpose a threat,‚Äù including the PKK, is ‚Äúalways on the agenda.‚Äù Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guards, however, denied the claim.

‚ÄúSafer than London!‚Äù North Korea opens door to Russian tourists,"North Korea leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.

North Korea has opened its doors to Russian tourists, issuing a licence for the first travel agency in Moscow to promise clients ‚Äúfull immersion‚Äù in the nation‚Äôs culture and enjoyment ‚Äúsafer than an evening walk in London‚Äù. NKOREAN.RU, a Russian company licensed by North Korea‚Äôs government, offers organised tours for groups of up to 10 people or individuals ‚Äúto show the travellers the multi-faceted life of this most closed of countries‚Äù.

Guests to North Korea must necessarily be ‚Äúchecked‚Äù before their trip and will always be accompanied by a guide who will monitor the ‚Äúadequate behaviour of the tourist and guarantee his safety.‚Äù Pictures of strategic and military facilities are banned and long talks with locals ‚Äúare not recommended‚Äù.

North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and dozens of missile tests since the beginning of last year, significantly raising tension on the heavily militarised Korean peninsula and in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Two tests of inter-continental ballistic missiles in July triggered a new round of tougher global sanctions. Faced with economic problems made harder by multiple sanctions, the Pyongyang government is keen to develop tourism to earn cash.

The most pricey tour, 15 days ‚Äúfull immersion in the culture of North Korea‚Äù costing 118,090 roubles ($1,997), includes visits to a farm, a mineral water factory, a Buddhist temple, walks in the mountains and an introduction to national cuisine. Visits to numerous museums to founding leader Kim Il-Sung are also on offer. Other less demanding tours include relaxation on a beach, an aviation show and even a beer festival. It is unclear how popular these trips will be among Russians who have already developed a fondness for visiting Europe and the affordable resorts of Turkey and Thailand.

Johnson & Johnson asked to pay a record $417 million to ovarian cancer victim,"Bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder line a drugstore shelf in New York.(Reuters File Photo) Bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder line a drugstore shelf in New York.(Reuters File Photo)

A Los Angeles jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $ 417 million to a woman who claimed in a lawsuit that the talc in its iconic baby powder causes ovarian cancer when applied regularly for feminine hygiene. The lawsuit was brought by a California woman, Eva Echeverria, who alleged Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about the potential cancer risks of talcum powder.

Echeverria developed ovarian cancer as a ‚Äúproximate result of the unreasonably dangerous and defective nature of talcum powder,‚Äù Echeverria said in her lawsuit. Echeverria‚Äôs attorney, Mark Robinson, said his client hoped the verdict would lead Johnson & Johnson to include additional warnings on its products.

‚ÄúMrs. Echeverria is dying from this ovarian cancer and she said to me all she wanted to do was to help the other women throughout the whole country who have ovarian cancer for using Johnson & Johnson for 20 and 30 years,‚Äù Robinson said.

‚ÄúShe really didn‚Äôt want sympathy,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúShe just wanted to get a message out to help these other women.‚Äù Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said in a statement that the company will appeal the jury‚Äôs decision.

She says while the company sympathizes with those impacted by ovarian cancer, she says science supports the safety of Johnson‚Äôs baby powder.

A St Louis, Missouri jury in May awarded $110.5 million to a Virginia woman who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012.

She had blamed her illness on her use for more than 40 years of the company‚Äôs talcum powder-containing products. Besides that case, three other jury trials in St. Louis reached similar outcomes last year √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù issuing awards of $72 million, $ 70.1 million and $ 55 million, for a combined total of $ 307.6 million.

Goodrich said the company is preparing for additional trials in the US and will continue to defend the product‚Äôs safety.

"Billy Payne retires as Masters, Augusta National chairman","Billy Payne announced on Wednesday that he is retiring as chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club. (Source: AP) Billy Payne announced on Wednesday that he is retiring as chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club. (Source: AP)

Billy Payne is retiring as chairman of Augusta National and the Masters, ending 11 years of substantial change that included the club having its first female members and playing a leading role in growing the game around the world.

Payne officially retires on Oct. 16 when the club opens for a new season.

‚ÄúThere are two people that matter here _ Clifford Roberts and Bobby Jones,‚Äù Payne said of the Augusta National co-founders. ‚ÄúThe rest of us are custodians. We do our best to first embrace, and thereafter hopefully to advance their philosophies for this club and for the game of golf _ their obsession for detail, their passion to be the best. And I‚Äôve done that now for a considerable number of years.‚Äù

Payne will be succeeded by Fred Ridley, a former U.S. Amateur champion and USGA president who is chairman of the Masters competition committee. Ridley will be the seventh chairman, and the first to have played in the Masters.

Payne stays on as chairman emeritus.

He ends a remarkable career marked by two sporting events in which he had little previous experience. Payne, 69, had never been to the Olympics when he led a long-shot bid to bring the Summer Games to Atlanta in 1996, relying heavily on corporate support and showing early signs of his feelings for diversity and inclusion with whom he selected to serve on the Atlanta organizing committee. Two of the first five were women.

Payne, who did not take up golf until his adult years, was invited to join Augusta National in 1997, a year after he concluded his work with the Atlanta Games. He became media chairman of the Masters three years later, and he was Hootie Johnson‚Äôs choice to succeed him as chairman in 2006.

He spent 11 years blending his ideas for progress with the traditions of a club that dates to 1931. As chairman, he ruled more with an open mind than an iron fist. He spoke openly about the support of his staff, and of the members.

Ten years after Johnson stubbornly stood his ground under pressure to have female members, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore joined Augusta National in 2012.

That was but a small part of Payne‚Äôs influence over the club and that Masters.

Wanting to expand the reach of golf, he worked with the R&A to start the Asia-Pacific Amateur, awarding the winner a spot in the Masters. The idea was to create heroes in an emerging market. The second winner was Hideki Matsuyama of Japan, who now is No. 2 in the world. The USGA and R&A joined with Augusta National‚Äôs next venture, the Latin America Amateur.

Payne also brought in the USGA and PGA of America to start the Drive, Chip and Putt competition, which attracts children all over the country to compete in golf skills, with the finals held at Augusta National on the Sunday before the Masters.

Payne considers those grow-the-game initiatives and enhancing the experience and camaraderie for club members the two achievements that bring him the most pride.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty clear that both our founders were proponents and advocates and lovers of the game of golf,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat has changed lately is that we have significantly more resources to fulfill objectives that they had from the very early years. So all these `grow-the-game initiatives,‚Äô it‚Äôs nothing new at Augusta National. It‚Äôs just that one day we said, `Let‚Äôs make a bigger investment.‚Äù‚Äô

The investments included work at the home of the Masters.

The club has scooped up land around the perimeter and turned Augusta National into more of a campus than a golf course. That includes free parking for the spectators, and the opening of Berckmans Place, a state-of-the-art hospitality area just beyond the fifth fairway.

Payne loves to tell the story of how his father would always ask him, ‚ÄúDid you do your best?‚Äù Payne says he never felt he could answer affirmatively, which drove him to a relentless work ethic in bringing the Olympics to Atlanta and in his role as Augusta National chairman.

‚ÄúYes, there‚Äôs a striving for perfection,‚Äù Payne said. ‚ÄúStriving for perfection is truly an obsession here, in the context of the Masters. We want to be able to provide for our patrons, our fans around the world, the absolute best sporting experience they have ever encountered. And we go to extremes to try to do that.‚Äù

Augusta National last year added a two-story press building, the latest and most grandiose of buildings it has created with the Southern architectural style that Payne feels fans around the world have come to expect when they think of Augusta National and the Masters.

‚ÄúWe never get it quite right,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut man, we try hard.‚Äù

Payne was the first chairman who had never met either Jones or Roberts.

Ridley first met Roberts when he played the Masters in 1976 as the U.S. Amateur champion. Like Payne, his background is in real estate law. Payne recalls that when he began his tenure as chairman, his predecessor told him the most important job he faced was finding his own successor.

‚ÄúThis honor ‚Ä¶ is too great for one person to claim as their own for too long a period of time,‚Äù Payne said. ‚ÄúI retire knowing it is simply the right thing to do _ and at the right moment _ to open the door and invite someone new to be called upon to lead.‚Äù

India vs Sri Lanka: Another arrow in Jasprit Bumrah‚Äôs quiver,"In the first ODI at Dambulla, Bumrah stuck to his basic weapons, the yorkers and cutters. (Source: Reuters) In the first ODI at Dambulla, Bumrah stuck to his basic weapons, the yorkers and cutters. (Source: Reuters)

The go-to man in the Indian team is Jasprit Bumrah, when it comes to limited-overs cricket. The Gujarat fast-medium bowler is a natural with his yorkers, which makes him so successful in death-overs. An economy rate of 4.86 over 17 ODIs, when modern bats and benign pitches have made the bowlers‚Äô job very difficult, is a testimony to his shorter formats bowling skills.

His height allows him to extract bounce off the deck and Bumrah also has a deceptive bouncer. The 23-year-old is now trying to develop a knuckle ball. Knuckle ball is baseball‚Äôs export to cricket. A knuckler, as it is called in baseball, minimises the spin of the ball in flight, causing an unpredictable motion. In cricket, a knuckle ball dips alarmingly mid-flight and starts wobbling. In layman‚Äôs term, it is a fast bowler‚Äôs doosra, to be bowled through the strength of the finger-tips.

Like Zaheer Khan, pioneer of the knuckle ball in Indian cricket who picked the art from South African Charl Langeveldt, Bumrah, too, was covering the ball in his run-up while trying the new variety at the nets before India‚Äôs first ODI. In the Dambulla game, however, he basically stuck to his stock ball that skidded through quickly off a length. He seems to be searching for more perfection and confidence before using it frequently in a match.

A bit of an IPL 2017 recap could be contextual here. In the fifth match, between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils, Kedar Jadhav had lined himself up to lift Zaheer over mid-off. But a knuckle ball from the veteran seamer deceived him. Beaten by the mid-air dip, Jadhav was holed out inside the circle.

Zaheer, the master

Zaheer mastered the art with ridiculous ease after he learnt the process from Langeveldt in 2010. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the next Indian bowler to realise its wicket-taking potential as he started practicing the delivery after the Australia series earlier. It passed on to Mohit Sharma and now, Bumrah appears to have developed a serious interest for it.

Gujarat Lions seamer Andrew Tye‚Äôs success with the knuckle ball in the last IPL could also be a reason for its increasing popularity among the Indian bowlers.

Bumrah bowled first change after Kumar and Hardik Pandya shared the new ball in the first ODI. He started off with a slower against Danushka Gunathilaka but it didn‚Äôt quite come off the finger-tips. On a pitch that offered little movement, there was no swing either, the fast bowler rather stuck to basics and used off-cutters occasionally.

Against a well-set Gunathilaka and Niroshan Dickwella, he didn‚Äôt experiment much. His first spell of four overs went for 19 runs without a wicket.

In his second spell, with the Sri Lankan batting on the slide, Bumrah basically searched for the yorker length. There‚Äôs a school of thought that he overuses the delivery a little, especially at the death, and might become predictable after a while. Knuckle ball, when he perfects the art, will give him a new option; in the middle overs and towards the back end of the innings.

India‚Äôs fast bowling coach Bharat Arun is very approachable and as R Ashwin and Umesh Yadav‚Äôs revival would attest, he did a fine job during his first spell that lasted for close to two years. Now he is back to fine-tune the Indian bowlers.

Arun is impressed with Bumrah working on skills. ‚ÄúBlessed to have a bowling attack that‚Äôs so versatile and each one is so different from the other. So it‚Äôs about what the bowler wants to work on and my job is to give them feedback; the right feedback that helps them to evolve as a bowler.‚Äù

Jurgen Klopp ‚Äòokay‚Äô with wantaway Philippe Coutinho,"Liverpool‚Äôs American owners are not wavering in their stance on Philippe Coutinho, who has become an integral player for the Premier League team. (Source: Reuters) Liverpool‚Äôs American owners are not wavering in their stance on Philippe Coutinho, who has become an integral player for the Premier League team. (Source: Reuters)

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has said he has no problems with Barcelona target Philippe Coutinho and is ready to welcome the Brazilian back into the squad after he recovers from illness and injury.

Liverpool have rejected three bids from the Spanish side, including the latest last week which British media said came in at 125 million euros ($146.85 million).

Klopp has maintained he does not want to sell Coutinho, who missed Liverpool‚Äôs first three matches of the season due to a back injury. The attacking midfielder will also miss Wednesday‚Äôs Champions League play-off second leg against Hoffenheim.

‚ÄúYou asked is everything okay between us? I answered with of course. Yes, indeed, absolutely, 100 percent,‚Äù Klopp told reporters on Tuesday, adding that there was no concrete date for the 25-year-old‚Äôs return.

‚ÄúPhil can‚Äôt start tomorrow because on top (of the back problem) he‚Äôs now ill. If he started training again tomorrow it would take time because he hasn‚Äôt trained for a long time.‚Äù

Liverpool hold a 2-1 advantage over Hoffenheim from the first leg in Germany and Klopp said his side would look to capitalise on home advantage to seal a spot in the Champions League group stage.

‚ÄúAnfield is a main factor, we all know it, it‚Äôs a very special place. Nothing happens by itself ‚Äì we have to perform, we have to deliver ‚Äì but then we all know the atmosphere can and will help you,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI really hope that everybody is ready for this game, everybody is ready to fight. I would be concerned if the people thought it was a weak side coming from Hoffenheim‚Ä¶

After the Champions League game, Liverpool host Arsenal in the league on Sunday.

"Excessive force won‚Äôt solve Myanmar‚Äôs Rohingya crisis, says Annan panel","Internally displaced Rohingyas are silhouetted along the river bank where their fishing boats are docked, in Thae Chaung IDP camp on the outskirts of Sittwe. (Source: Reuters) Internally displaced Rohingyas are silhouetted along the river bank where their fishing boats are docked, in Thae Chaung IDP camp on the outskirts of Sittwe. (Source: Reuters)

Myanmar should respond to a crisis over its Muslim Rohingya community in a ‚Äúcalibrated‚Äù way without excessive force, a panel led by former UN chief Kofi Annan said on Thursday, adding that radicalisation was a danger if problems were not addressed. The treatment of approximately 1.1 million Rohingya has emerged as majority Buddhist Myanmar‚Äôs most contentious human rights issue as it makes a transition from decades of harsh military rule.

Annan‚Äôs commission ‚Äì appointed last year by leader Aung San Suu Kyi to come up with long-term solutions for the violence-riven, ethnically and religiously divided Rakhine state ‚Äì said perpetrators of rights abuses should be held accountable.

Security deteriorated sharply in the western state on the border with Bangladesh last October when Rohingya militants killed nine policemen in attacks on border posts. In response, the Myanmar military sent troops fanning out into Rohingya villages in an offensive beset by allegations of arson, killings and rape by the security forces, and which sent 87,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh.

The situation in the state deteriorated again this month when security forces began a new ‚Äúclearance operation‚Äù with tension shifting to a township, Rathetaung, where Buddhist Rakhine and Rohingya communities live side-by-side.

‚ÄúWhile Myanmar has every right to defend its own territory, a highly militarised response is unlikely to bring peace to the area,‚Äù the nine-member commission said in its final report.

Instead, a nuanced, comprehensive response was urgently needed to ‚Äúensure that violence does not escalate and inter-communal tensions are kept under control‚Äù, it said.

The commission warned that if human rights were not respected and ‚Äúthe population remain politically and economically marginalized ‚Äì northern Rakhine State may provide fertile ground for radicalisation, as local communities may become increasingly vulnerable to recruitment by extremists‚Äù.

The Rohingya are denied citizenship and classified as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite claiming roots in the region that go back centuries, with communities marginalized and occasionally subjected to communal violence.

Annan has visited Myanmar three times since his appointment, including two trips to Rakhine State. On Thursday, he presented his findings to Suu Kyi and army chief Min Aung Hlaing and was due to give a news conference later in the day.

The United Nations said in a report in February security forces had instigated a campaign that ‚Äúvery likely‚Äù amounted to crimes against humanity and possibly ethnic cleansing. That led to the establishment of a UN fact-finding mission a month later.

But Myanmar‚Äôs domestic investigation team criticised the UN report this month and rejected allegations of abuses. Myanmar declined to grant visas to three experts appointed by the United Nations and instead the government said Myanmar would comply with recommendations by the Annan team.

But Annan‚Äôs panel ‚Äì which has a broad mandate to look into, among other things, long-term economic development, education and healthcare in the state ‚Äì said it was ‚Äúnot mandated to investigate specific cases of alleged human rights violations‚Äù.

It said that the government ‚Äúshould ensure ‚Äì based on independent and impartial investigation ‚Äì that perpetrators of serious human rights violations are held accountable‚Äù. The commission made a host of other recommendations, ranging from a faster and more transparent citizenship verification process, to lifting restrictions on movement and equal access to healthcare for all residents.

AITA terminates Vijay Amritraj backed CTL contract over non-payment,"Vijay Amritraj was one of the Directors of SSPL. (Source: Express photo) Vijay Amritraj was one of the Directors of SSPL. (Source: Express photo)

The All India Tennis Association (AITA) on Tuesday terminated the contract of Vijay Amritraj‚Äôs Champions Tennis League due to non-payment of annual fee of Rs 30 lakh for the 2016 season.

The All India Tennis Association (AITA) had entered into a nine-year contract with Second Serve Private Limited (SSPL), led by former star Amritraj, who was one of the Directors of the company. However, the AITA would allow them to place a fresh bid when tender will be floated next year (2018).

AITA Secretary General Hironmoy Chatterjee confirmed that the organisers have failed to pay Rs 30 lakh to them as per contract apart from 10 percent of surplus amount.

‚ÄúThey did not conduct league last year and the contract was to have it for nine years without any break. They did not pay the fixed fee of Rs 30 lakh. We had given them a chance to conduct it this year to which they initially agreed,‚Äù Chatterjee told PTI.

‚ÄúBut later on, they said that the franchises would not agree to have it for just 2017 season. They insisted that we allow them to conduct it for nine year as per the agreement but our Executive Committee rejected it,‚Äù Chatterjee.

The senior AITA official also said CTL organisers also failed to pay 10 per cent of surplus amount. ‚ÄúThey never paid that 10 per cent citing losses,‚Äù Chatterjee further added.

The AITA though will allow SSPL to place a fresh bid next year. ‚ÄúWe have told them they can apply next year, we won‚Äôt stop them. We will give them preference,‚Äù he said.

Some of the global stars such as Martina Hingis, Feliciano Lopez, Jelena Jankovic, Agnieszka Radwanska, Garbine Muguruza and India‚Äôs very own Leander Paes had competed in the League in the first two editions.

CTL CEO Arjun Rao did not take calls when efforts were made to get his comments on the development and Vijay Amritraj also could not be reached for his reaction.

Manchester United aim for hat-trick of wins to start season,"Jose Mourinho has used the word ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù a lot in recent days and his side certainly seem to have a swagger about them. (Source: Reuters) Jose Mourinho has used the word ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù a lot in recent days and his side certainly seem to have a swagger about them. (Source: Reuters)

Fresh from consecutive 4-0 wins, Manchester United will be aiming for a hat-trick of victories when they face 2015 champions Leicester City at Old Trafford on Saturday.

Jose Mourinho‚Äôs side have been the most impressive of any of the title contenders in the Premier League so far with new signing Romelu Lukaku claiming three goals from the opening two games.

Leicester, though, have also given their fans plenty of encouragement with a confident 2-0 win over promoted Brighton following on from their 4-3 defeat at Arsenal in the league‚Äôs opening game.

If United needed any reminder of the threat that Craig Shakespeare‚Äôs team pose on the break, City led 3-1 at the Emirates before Arsenal‚Äôs late comeback.

Recent form in head-to-head games suggests United should have the upper hand though ‚Äî they triumphed 4-1 in the corresponding fixture last season and then enjoyed a 3-0 win at the King Power Stadium.

Chelsea bounced back from their opening-day shock home defeat to Burnley with victory over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley last week but face another tough test against Everton on Sunday.

Ronald Koeman‚Äôs Everton impressed in their 1-1 draw at Manchester City on Monday with Wayne Rooney scoring his second goal in as many games. Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas is available for selection after completing his suspension but skipper Gary Cahill remains suspended after his opening-day red card.

Everton will be without French midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, who was sent off at the Etihad on Monday, and also have to cope with a tight schedule that sees them travel to Croatia on Thursday for a second-leg Europa League tie with Hajduk Split.

Liverpool, who qualified for the Champions League group stage on Wednesday with a win over Hoffenheim, have their biggest test of the Premier League season so far when they host Arsenal at Anfield.

Wembley Stadium will see a repeat of the 1962 FA Cup Final when ‚Äòhome side‚Äô Spurs host Burnley looking to bounce back from their loss to Chelsea last week. Promoted Huddersfield Town look to extend their 100 percent record when they host Southampton.

North Korea‚Äôs military unleashed its standard fiery threats to greet the start of annual US-South Korean military drills that the North claims are an invasion rehearsal.

North Korea has previously issued similar warlike rhetoric whenever US and South Korean troops conducted major joint exercises.An unprompted direct attack is extremely unlikely because the United States vastly outguns Pyongyang.

Janata On MISA

The Janata government‚Äôs commitment to repeal MISA is absolute and unconditional, Home Minister Charan Singh said in a statement. Clarifying the government stand on the release of political prisoners, he pointed out that maintenance of law and order was the responsibility of state governments and the Centre could not force them to act. If MISA had not yet been struck off the statute book, ‚Äúit is because an examination of the proposals, for strengthening of other laws and consequential matters, as promised in the President‚Äôs address, has not been completed.‚Äù

Singh issued the lengthy clarification because he thought press reports that thousands of political prisoners were still in jails created an impression that the Janata government or his Ministry was dragging its feet. He said instructions had been issued to release all persons connected with banned organisations. So far as MISA detenus were concerned, the number had come down from 6,847 on March 25 to 592 on August I8.

Sansa Stark aka Sophie Turner is secretly smirking at something. In the trailer, we saw her looking spooky and embracing a black hood. We wonder what she is upto. Especially after Lord Baelish ie Littlefinger's little setup to turn the Stark girls Sansa and Arya against each other. With Arya's training under the Faceless Man and Sansa's years of abuse, it would really be a disappointment if they fall for his trap. (Source: Photo by HBO)

After Bronn saved Jaime from the fiery wrath of Daenerys' dragon Drogon, his loyalty to the Lannisters is definitely unquestionable. Or is it? He himself revealed that he did it only for the sake of his own personal benefits. But then, he was also the one to arrange for Tyrion and Jaime's little meet-up in King's Landing.

The Utmost Perennial,"Author Arundhati Roy at the event in Delhi Author Arundhati Roy at the event in Delhi

The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, Arundhati Roy‚Äôs second novel after 20 years, is no longer just in book form. On Wednesday evening, at a small gathering at the Itu Chaudhuri Design Studio (ICD) in Delhi, the book came to life in a digital avatar through the Re:Reader. A project conceived by Lisa Rath of ICD, the Re:Reader offers a digital, and yet, a rather intimate experience of the novel ‚Äî chapter by chapter, the website explores the Utmost world through extracts, animation, Roy‚Äôs voiceovers, and a variety of typography. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd call it Utmost Perennial. It‚Äôs a new, fun way of introducing a book to people who haven‚Äôt read it. And another way of enjoying it for people who have. And it‚Äôll be out there ‚Äî everywhere ‚Äî without an expiry date,‚Äù said Roy at the launch.

In a phone conversation, Rath chats about how the Re:Reader came to be:

How did the idea of the Re:Reader come to you?

It came about a month or so before the book was to be released. Arundhati and I were talking to each other and wondering if there was an interesting way to present the book to the world at large; to go beyond videos and interviews. I told her that it wouldn‚Äôt be a promotional piece, rather, it would be an experimental one. We discussed the idea of something on the web and she liked it very much. She gave me a copy of the novel to read and I started visualising what it could be like.

How did you pick which parts of the book would make it to the Re:Reader?

When I began reading, I could see that it had to be typographic and elegant; I picked parts of the novel that I could emote to, purely from my perspective. Arundhati had told me that one could begin reading the book from any chapter, that it wasn‚Äôt a linear read in her mind. I treated every chapter as its own, with its own animation, music, to bring out the different emotions the narrative evokes. But none of it reveals the characters or the roles they play. I don‚Äôt quote any portions that would give the story away; in places, I used animation instead of text, so that readers could wonder about the relationship between them.

How long did it take to complete the project?

It took us roughly two-three months. We were experimenting a lot with the coding bits, on how to get the timing of certain things right. I had the idea and the design, but it had to be conveyed to the developer.

The Re:Reader also increases the shelf-life of the novel, or any novel that is given this treatment.

Yes, once it is on the web, it is immortal. A lot of people might not read the reviews of the book, but maybe they‚Äôd stumble upon the site and engage with it. I am experimenting with the web because, usually, it offers instant gratification. I wanted to push the boundaries and see if something online can urge us to go deeper, can be immersive and timeless. I‚Äôd be interested to do this with more books; I‚Äôm reading White Tears by Hari Kunzru and since I‚Äôm in this headspace, I‚Äôm constantly thinking of how that will translate on Re:Reader.

Pro Kabaddi 2017: Strong defence keeps Gujarat Fortunegiants unbeaten,"Gujarat Fortunegiants are on a seven-match unbeaten run. Gujarat Fortunegiants are on a seven-match unbeaten run.

Playing their first away match after a stellar show in Ahmedabad, Gujarat Fortunegiants continued their victory march with a thumping 35-21 win over Puneri Paltan in Lucknow. As it has been the case so far in the league, Fortunegiants defenders kept the game in their hold and didn‚Äôt let the experience of Deepak Niwas Hooda, Rajesh Mondal hamper their unbeaten run in the fifth edition of Pro Kabaddi.

‚ÄúIt is good for kabaddi lovers that a team playing its first season is putting up a great show. I wish we continue to deliver such performances. I also hope we see other teams step up to the occasion and play like Gujarat Fortunegiants have done so far,‚Äù said Gujarat Fortunegiants coach Manpreet Singh. ‚ÄúFazel played exceptionally well and was supported by Abozar,‚Äù he added.

The Iranian dup of Fazrl Atrachali and Abozar Mighuani, who have been guarding Gujarat‚Äôs two corners, didn‚Äôt let Pune‚Äôs raiders escape from their aggressive play. In the 12th minute of the first half, Fortunegiants took down Deepak Niwas Hooda with Fazel‚Äôs strong ankle hold giving them a four point lead. ‚ÄúBoth of them are experienced players and know each other very nicely. They are very well aware of each other‚Äôs tactics. Their combination is working for us,‚Äù Manpreet said.

It was just matter of time, that Fortunegiants defenders forced the first all-out of the match taking their score to 14-5. From there on, the Pune team couldn‚Äôt make a way back and at half time the score was 16-7.

While Pune managed to keep Gujarat‚Äôs ‚Äòraiding machine‚Äô Sachin Tawar quiet in the second half, Abozar in the right corner led the rout of Pune‚Äôs raiders. With three minutes remaining in the match, Abozar held Deepak‚Äôs right leg so firmly that the Pune captain could not make an escape from it. With Deepak taken off, Pune trailed 20-28 and were inflicted the second all-out by Pawan Sehrawat‚Äôs successful raid. When asked about his game strategy against his previous teammates, Fazel said, ‚ÄúI have played with Rajesh Mondal, Dharmaraj Cheralathan, Sandeep Narwal, Deepak Hooda and I know how they play. So, I had planned accordingly. I feel good after scoring nine points.‚Äù

Both teams possess strong defence and it was showcased as star raiders from either side could not score more than five points. Fazel, who suffered an injury in his right hand during Gujarat‚Äôs previous match, scored his seventh high 5. With this win, Gujarat are now on a seven match unbeaten run and top Zone A with 41 points.

UP Yoddha yet to open their account at home

Another night and another one to despair for Nitin Tomar and UP Yoddha as they succumbed to their fourth defeat at the hands of Bengal Warriors. As it has been the case for the debutants, last five minutes eventually turned the game into Warriors favour as the visitors registered a narrow 32-31 win in Lucknow. ‚ÄúIt is unfortunate that we could not cross the line once again. Our defence gets nervous in the last moments and that is where we lose the game,‚Äù said Nitin.

According to UP coach Uday Kumar, his team had a plan to stop Jang Kun Lee and Maninder Singh. But it was Deepak Narwal‚Äôs Super 10 points that took the game away from the hosts. Nitin, who has been leading the Yoddha‚Äôs charge, scored eight points but his efforts went in vein as the defence once again fumbled in the last moments.

Lee and Deepak proved difficult to hold as Nitin and his men‚Äôs efforts were not enough for the hosts. Despite starting the game on an even note, Bengal team forced an all out in the final seconds of the first half to take a 19-14 lead at the break. In the second half, both the teams kept the scoreline intact while each and every point scored by the home team was cheered by the crowd. ‚ÄúWe will definitely win the last two games. We want to win it for the home support we have received so far.‚Äù

Neither team was willing to give an inch with only three minutes to play. Warriors took a narrow lead with South Korean sensation Jang Kun Lee giving his side a two point lead. However, with Mahesh Goud, the UP team manage to make it 31-32 before Deepak made an empty raid to make sure that Bengal Warriors recorded their third win of the season.

Pay to stay behind bars! Thailand has a new prison-themed hotel,"The owner of the hotel was inspired by the iconic Hollywood film, ‚ÄòThe Shawshank Redemption‚Äô. The owner of the hotel was inspired by the iconic Hollywood film, ‚ÄòThe Shawshank Redemption‚Äô.

People may love the luxuries of a five-star hotel but for those who like it edgy and different, there‚Äôs a lot more fun in staying at some of the world‚Äôs weirdest hotels. So, though as a (hopefully) law-abiding person, it‚Äôs (thankfully) unlikely that you‚Äôll ever know what the inside of a prison would look like, an entrepreneur in Thailand figured why not create that as an experience for those with a curious mind.

Joining the genre of weird hotels such as the ‚Äúcorpse hotels‚Äù in Japan or like the Hotel La Claustra in Switzerland, where people spend their time in a former army bunker, is the Sook Station in Bangkok, which just opened earlier this summer and offers guests the opportunity to spend a night behind bars (quite literally). Designed to mimic jail, enthusiasts can now spend the night in a prison cell for around 1,300 Thai Baht (¬£30 or Rs2,500) per night, and have a first-hand experience of a Thai prison cell.

The prison-inspired hotel treats its guest well but all perks are styled to suit what a prisoner would otherwise face.

The rooms have metal gates with rods, bunk beds, common toilets and light-out curfew. The guests, rather inmates are given black and white striped clothes and a mug shot is taken on arrival. The compound is also secured with barbed wires, giving off the vibes of a correctional home. Apart from small cells measuring just 8 sqm, there are larger family cells too.

Located at Bang Na district of Bangkok, just 15km away from Suvarnabhumi Airport, it has become quite a hit among tourists. Here, the guests are not given keys to their rooms but receive an inmate number, which can be used as room codes and are given a criminal record as a memento.

Sook Station that translates to ‚Äúhappiness station‚Äù in English does come with a few luxuries that inmates wouldn‚Äôt find in a jail. From free Wi-Fi and car parking to delicious food served at its restaurant, this unique theme hotel is not that gloomy.

And if one is too tired of the dim lighting and iron gates, there are rooms with a balcony too. The hotel also offers an outdoor Jacuzzi, a relaxation lounge, office space and halls to host events. The terrace is the perfect place to even have a romantic date with fairy lights. It also has a 24-hour coffee shop that too follows the prison theme.

Inspired by the iconic Hollywood film, The Shawshank Redemption, the owner told the Lonely Planet that most of the guests like it because it is unique and comfortable.

But this is not the first prison-themed hotel. Karostas Cietums is a military prison in Latvia that housed enemies and revolutionaries during Stalin‚Äôs time that opened in 1905. Now turned into a hotel that is just open for overnight stays, visitors can experience the harsh prison life. And if the severe condition is not preferred, then one can experience luxuries at other prison-turned-resorts. While there is hotel Het Arresthuis (Dutch for house arrest) outside Amsterdam, a 90-year-old prison in Istanbul is now a posh Four Seasons hotel. And luxurious Liberty Hotel in Boston is also a former prison.

Barcelona Twitter account hacked; reveals spicy transfer tidbit,"FC Barcelona‚Äôs Twitter account was hacked on Wednesday morning. (Source: File) FC Barcelona‚Äôs Twitter account was hacked on Wednesday morning. (Source: File)

Football club Barcelona‚Äôs Twitter account was hacked early Wednesday morning by a group claiming to be called ‚ÄúOur Mine‚Äù and sought the club to contact them after their interesting transfer signing tweet left many perplexed. The original tweet, posted just after 7.30 AM IST said, ‚ÄúWelcome Angel Di Maria to FC Barcelona! #DiMariaFCB‚Äù.

The original tweet claiming the transfer signing of the Argentine midfielder left many confused considering the player is well settled in Paris with PSG and had played in the past for Barcelona‚Äôs arch-rivals Real Madrid.

The hack was resolved by 9.33 AM IST when the club tweeted, ‚ÄúOur accounts have been hacked tonight. We‚Äôre working to solve the problem as soon as possible. Thanks for your patience.‚Äù

While it looks difficult that the signing is indeed on the cards but it added to Barcelona‚Äôs compounding woes and PR nightmare ever since the departure of Neymar from the club for a world record 222 million Euros. Since then, the club have been unable to find a suitable replacement for the Brazilian with multiple bids for Liverpool‚Äôs Philippe Coutinho rejected. And on Tuesday, Barcelona sued Neymar for 8.5 million Euros breach of contract.

‚ÄúIn this lawsuit, the club demands the amount already paid as a bonus for the renewal of his contract for breach of contract, 8.5 million euros in damages, and an additional 10% in interests,‚Äù Barcelona said in a statement.

Barcelona‚Äôs Twitter hackers posted three tweets. Barcelona‚Äôs Twitter hackers posted three tweets.

US targets Chinese and Russia entities over North Korea,"The Trump administration is still hoping China will pressure North Korea.(Source: AP Photo) The Trump administration is still hoping China will pressure North Korea.(Source: AP Photo)

The United States is imposing new North Korea-related sanctions, targeting Chinese and Russian firms and individuals for supporting Pyongyang‚Äôs weapons programs, US officials announced on Tuesday, but stopped short of an anticipated focus on Chinese banks.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control designated six Chinese-owned entities, one Russian, one North Korean and two based in Singapore. They included a Namibia-based subsidiary of a Chinese company and a North Korean entity operating in Namibia. Six individuals including four Russians, one Chinese and one North Korean were targeted, the Treasury Department said.

The move follows toughened United Nations sanctions agreed this month after North Korea tested its first two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. The Treasury Department said the new sanctions targeted those helping already-designated individuals supporting North Korea‚Äôs nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its energy trade. They included three Chinese coal importers.

The steps also targeted those helping North Korea send workers abroad and enabling sanctioned North Korea entities to get access to the US and international financial system. ‚ÄúTreasury will continue to increase pressure on North Korea by targeting those who support the advancement of nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and isolating them from the American financial system,‚Äù Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said in a statement.

‚ÄúIt is unacceptable for individuals and companies in China, Russia, and elsewhere to enable North Korea to generate income used to develop weapons of mass destruction.‚Äù A new round of US sanctions had been expected, but Washington appeared to delay them while securing Chinese and Russian support for tougher UN steps.

US officials and UN diplomats say the threat of US ‚Äúsecondary sanctions‚Äù against Chinese firms with North Korean ties and trade pressure helped persuade China to drop opposition to the UN sanctions. The latest steps stopped short of targeting Chinese financial institutions dealing with North Korea, a step that would have greatly angered Beijing. The Trump administration is still hoping China will pressure Pyongyang.

‚ÄúThe sanctions target a range of North Korea‚Äôs illicit activities and the focus on Chinese facilitators is another message to Beijing,‚Äù said Anthony Ruggiero, a Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior fellow and former US Treasury official. ‚ÄúHowever, there are missing elements. There‚Äôs no focus on the efforts of Chinese banks that facilitate these transactions. In addition, these Chinese networks likely have additional front companies operating on behalf of the network and those were not sanctioned.‚Äù

China is North Korea‚Äôs neighbor and main trading partner and US foreign policy experts say Chinese companies have long had a key role in financing Pyongyang. The Chinese and Russians embassies in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. China has said in the past it is strongly opposed to unilateral sanctions outside the U.N. framework, and has accused the United States of using ‚Äúlong-arm‚Äù jurisdiction in targeting Chinese entities.

Annabelle Creation movie review: This Conjuring spin-off disappoints,"Annabelle Creation movie review: The questions we want answered are never asked in the movie. Annabelle Creation movie review: The questions we want answered are never asked in the movie.

Annabelle Creation movie cast: Miranda Otto, Stephanie Sigman, Anthony LaPaglia, Lulu Wilson

Annabelle Creation movie director: David Sandberg

Annabelle Creation movie rating: 2 stars

PARENTS frightened of their own child have sustained many a horror film. A malevolent spirit in a child‚Äôs doll many others. We needn‚Äôt look further than even The Conjuring, of which Annabelle: Creation is the fourth spin-off, and the prequel to a prequel. Yeah, by now, they should have this pat down. Annabelle: Creation has all that, plus a desolate house, orphans, nun, a mysterious woman behind a curtain, a forbidden door, a scarecrow, a barn, a basement, a chair lift, a lift hidden behind a wall, a well, and lots and lots of dolls. Who needs a story, or even one character that does things besides opening strange doors?

Sometime in the early 1940s, a doll-maker and his wife, Samuel (LaPaglia) and Esther (Otto) Mullins, lose their young daughter to an accident. They sequester themselves in their old, rickety farmhouse, away from all civilization, along with their grief, the doll Annabelle (named after their daughter) and ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù. Twelve years later, to this house arrives a nun (Sigman) with six girls, her wards at an orphanage that has shut down. One of the girls, Janice (Bateman), is polio-afflicted, and left on her own by the other girls, starts exploring the house with its many secrets and strange happenings.

Then the happenings never cease, with director Sandberg (Lights Out) deploying largely the same tricks. The questions we want answered are never asked. So, we know nothing of the nun, but for the titillating detail that she was once at a ‚ÄúRomania convent where the other sisters have no contact with the outside world‚Äù; nothing about the girls, of varying ages and desires, and some more interesting than the others, stuck together; and almost zero about the couple who have put them in harm‚Äôs way. The actors, with the exception of Bateman, and that largely because she is the star victim this time, are largely impassive.

One thing is clear though, we are not done with Annabelle yet. The photo the nun shows of her Romania convent has a mysterious figure lurking in the shadows. Up next in The Conjuring series is Nun.

Donald Trump to meet scandal-hit Malaysian leader Najib Razak in September,"Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. (File Photo) Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. (File Photo)

US President Donald Trump plans to meet Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is embroiled in a corruption scandal at home, on September 12 at the White House, officials from both countries confirmed on Thursday.

The US Justice Department has been conducting a criminal probe of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a fund founded by Najib, which is facing money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.

In civil lawsuits, the Justice Department has sought to seize a total of about $1.7 billion in assets it says were bought with misappropriated 1MDB funds.

Malaysia‚Äôs foreign ministry said in a statement that Najib will undertake the visit following an invitation from Trump.

‚ÄúThe two leaders are expected to discuss areas of mutually beneficial cooperation, including national security, the global fight against terrorism and extremism, and trade and investment that will benefit our nations and our peoples,‚Äù the foreign ministry said in the statement.

The United States sees Najib as a key partner in its fight against radical Islamists.

But that image has been damaged recently after Najib was linked to the 1MDB scandal, and his party overtly supported right-wing groups for political gains ahead of the polls that must be held by mid-2018.

Trump looks forward to ‚Äúdiscussing ways to strengthen and broaden our bilateral relationship and expand regional cooperation with one of America‚Äôs closest partners in Southeast Asia,‚Äù said a White House statement announcing Najib‚Äôs Sept. 12 visit.

The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the plan for a meeting, said Najib would likely use the White House visit to try to play down the possibility of further investigations into 1MDB.

Relations between Malaysia and the United Stated soured last year after the Justice Department filed lawsuits in connection with the 1MDB scandal and Najib sought to strengthen ties with China.

US relations with Malaysia, which the United States sees as an important partner in standing up to China‚Äôs extensive territorial claims in East Asia, had improved under former President Barack Obama, who in 2014 became the first US president to visit the country in 50 years.

Najib was a key ally in Obama‚Äôs strategic pivot to Asia, and was part of the collapsed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) pact.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is also expected to visit Malaysia in the coming months, local media reports said, although this has not been officially confirmed.

I would like to bowl a match-winning spell against Australia: Taskin Ahmed,"Taskin Ahmed is confident that his team can put up a good show against Australia. (Source: File) Taskin Ahmed is confident that his team can put up a good show against Australia. (Source: File)

Young Bangladesh pace bowler, Taskin Ahmed is confident that his team can put up a good show against Australia and has backed pacer Mustafizur Rahman to deliver a good performance. Takin also spoke about how in his brief Test career he has faced testing times and wants to do well against Australia.

Speaking to the media, Ahmed said, ‚ÄúWe always expect a lot from Mustafizur and he fulfils the expectations. Maybe he didn‚Äôt do all that well in the recent matches, however, it happens to the best of pacemen in world cricket; they also struggle in one or two matches.We are not thinking about this. I hope he makes a comeback. Besides Mustafizur, (Shafiul and I) also have the responsibility to do something good against Australia. They are one of the world‚Äôs best teams. But we know the (home) wickets better than them. We are familiar with everything.‚Äù If I get an opportunity, I will like to bowl a match-winning spell.

Speaking on his bowling, Taskin said, ‚ÄúIf I get an opportunity, I will like to bowl a match-winning spell. I don‚Äôt say that match-winning spell means taking five to seven wickets. I will like to bowl some good overs instead of that. As like, our spinners may take seven wickets and in the middle, I may pick two wickets. I really want to do something ‚Ä¶ that will help the team.‚Äù

Taking has recently started playing all the formats. Commenting on the experience and the learning curve, he said, ‚ÄúHaving played four Tests, I think this format is hard,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPreviously I only played ODIs and T20Is. In the longer version, you have to play according to plan. Change of pace is required. In Tests, you have to take each session as it comes. In ODIs and T20Is, one or two good spells are enough to end the game. But in Tests, you have to bowl seven or eight spells.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is not that easy. I really enjoyed bowling in New Zealand, not so much in Sri Lanka. And I haven‚Äôt played a single Test at home. I think I need to have patience. I hope I‚Äôll do something good going forward.‚Äù, he concluded.

Dipping sex ratio in Maharashtra: Experts mull replication of Indore model of sonography trackers,"‚ÄúIf the tracker is detached, an alert is sent to our phone from the particular clinic.

(Representational Image) ‚ÄúIf the tracker is detached, an alert is sent to our phone from the particular clinic. The tracker has helped curb illegal sex determinations,‚Äù said Satish Joshi, Indore district nodal officer, adding that cameras are installed in clinics to ensure the sonography test and form details belong to the same woman. (Representational Image)

Even as the state health department is of the opinion that an active tracker installed in sonography machines is not a solution to the declining sex ratio, on Wednesday, a meeting of expert consultants and state commission for women mulled over the success of the Indore-model of active tracker and whether the same could be followed in Maharashtra to improve the faltering sex ratio.

According to an initial survey in Maharashtra, nine talukas in Ratnagiri, Raigad, Pune, Osmanabad, Yavatmal, Nanded, Parbhani, and Nandurbar have shown a declining trend of sex ratio. The state sex ratio, which stood at 960 in 2015, has dropped below 900, shows analysis of new birth registrations. While reassessment is underway, the new figures have already worried officials. Mumbai, however, has a sex ratio of 933.

On Tuesday, following a meeting, state Health Minister Deepak Sawant announced that a tracker may not serve as a solution to the declining sex ratio. The state government is appointing a special officer to monitor implementation of the Pre Conception and Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act in state.

Misoprostol tablets, used for abortions, will be strictly categorised under schedule H for sales through prescriptions.

Indore, which began installing active trackers in sonography machines in 2014, is showing a stabilised sex ratio as opposed to Maharashtra districts. From 904, the sex ratio of the city has risen to 940 in 2016, data from 164 hospitals, in which trackers have been installed, show.

The tracker monitors sonography test of each pregnant woman in a clinic along with whether a sex determination test has been carried out. A radiologist or gynaecologist has to fill the online form for each patient, and the data is tracked by the collector‚Äôs office.

‚ÄúIf the tracker is detached, an alert is sent to our phone from the particular clinic. The tracker has helped curb illegal sex determinations,‚Äù said Satish Joshi, Indore district nodal officer, adding that cameras are installed in clinics to ensure the sonography test and form details belong to the same woman.

A similar project was initiated in Kolhapur in 2010 but could not be expanded to all clinics. Experts claim the tracker may be hacked and misused for sex determination. ‚ÄúWe will study possible solutions to improve sex ratio and present the Indore model to the health minister for consideration,‚Äù said Vijaya Rahatkar, chairperson of the state commission for women, adding that continued monitoring of PCPNDT Act can help avoid illegal abortions.

Mahesh Zagade, divisional commissioner, Nashik, who monitors health in four districts, said that the state government has been notified about declining sex ratio in Pune and Nashik regions.

‚ÄúThere is no one solution to this. While trackers may help, strict vigil on Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act and PCPNDT is necessary.‚Äù

"I know I will get my opportunity again, says Abhinav Mukund","Abhinav Mukund played a fine knock of 81 in the recently concluded Test series against Sri Lanka. (Source: AP) Abhinav Mukund played a fine knock of 81 in the recently concluded Test series against Sri Lanka. (Source: AP)

After putting up a relatively decent performance in the recently concluded Test series against Sri Lanka, Indian opener Abhinav Mukund has said that he is confident of getting another opportunity soon. Speaking to the TOI, Mukund revealed that it was not a new thing for him to go back to domestic cricket and score runs and again make a comeback and he hopes that it will help him reclaim the opening spot. It may be recalled here that Mukund had to make way for KL Rahul in the third Test despite scoring a fine knock 81 in his previous innings.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a new thing for me to go back to domestic cricket, score heavily and come back. I‚Äôm all set for the season ahead. Whatever opportunities I get, I want to do well. It‚Äôs not like I was dropped because of bad performance. It‚Äôs just that I had to make way for a regular. I think people in the team have an idea of what I can do now. That‚Äôs a good place to be in. I should take it forward from this and keep scoring runs so that I am always in the reckoning.‚Äù, Mukund said.

Expressing disappointment at missing out on the chance to open even after scoring a fifty, Mukund said, ‚ÄúObviously, it was disappointing to miss out. But the current Indian team is such that you have to make way for the regulars. There were players who sat out even after scoring a 300 (Karun Nair); that‚Äôs how the team is and that‚Äôs why we are the No. 1 side in the world. I understood it. Kohli and Shastri said they loved my commitment and were pleased with my efforts on the field and with the bat. I know I will get my opportunity again.‚Äù

Mukund also spoke about his post on social media where he addressed the issue of racism and revealed that he had been facing such comments for long. ‚ÄúI understand that people from Chennai or down south are generally dark in complexion. I don‚Äôt understand how trolling cannot be taken seriously. My teammates supported me. People could relate to what I said. In fact, a couple of ex-cricketers from Chennai did call me and said they too had faced such comments and that they were glad I came out. I wanted to make a statement so that people take it seriously. I think they have.‚Äù, he concluded.

R Ashwin is still in our plans: India bowling coach Bharat Arun,"R Ashwin will start his County stint with Worcestershire. R Ashwin will start his County stint with Worcestershire.

In a few days, R Ashwin will start his County stint with Worcestershire and the official word on his exclusion from the Indian ODI squad in Sri Lanka is that he‚Äôs‚Äúrested‚Äù. But with the recent emphasis on nurturing wrist spinners, there seems to be a question mark over Ashwin‚Äôs limited-overs future, especially on good pitches in overseas tours.

The Indian team bowling coach, Bharat Arun insisted that the off-spinner is in the scheme of ODI things. At the same time, however, he spoke about the team‚Äôs long-term plans. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ definitely yes. Ashwin is also part of the ODI team which we are looking at. We would also like to give a lot of opportunities to other bowlers as well. And then we have a long-term plan in place. And then we will take a call accordingly,‚Äù Arun told reporters.

Ashwin has picked 116 wickets in 20 Tests at 25.06 over the last 13 months. During the same period he accounted for eight scalps in nine ODIs at 53.75. The off-spinner has had been in and out of the ODI team and even after hugely successful home Test season he was axed for India‚Äôs Champions Trophy opener against Pakistan. In the next three matches he took one wicket at an average of 167.00. Kedar Jadhav, the part-time offie bagged three wickets at 22.33.

Soha Ali Khan shares power-packed pic doing prenatal yoga; here‚Äôs why you should follow her lead,"Soha Ali Khan practising the warrior pose. (Source: Instagram/sakpataudi) Soha Ali Khan practising the warrior pose. (Source: Instagram/sakpataudi)

When you are a celebrity, the need to stay fit is more of a necessity than just an overpowering desire to have a toned body. In the entertainment industry, not having a slender figure means setting off a torrent of criticism where bodyshaming simply becomes a part of reality. So, when Kareena Kapoor Khan walked about in unbridled abandon during her pregnancy, it ushered in a new outlook towards body weight and, of course, expecting celebrities. Over the past year, we‚Äôve seen the pregnant Bollywood mom-to-be brigade flaunt their pregnancy, and Kareena was there leading the pack.

Well, following her footsteps at the moment is sister-in-law, Soha Ali Khan. Not only is the actor, dressing up in beautiful maternity wear and enjoying every bit of her pregnancy, she is also showing others on how to stay fit during the nine months.

Recently, Khan shared a photo on Instagram where she can be seen practising yoga, the warrior pose to be precise, dressed in simple black leggings and a yellow crop top. Earlier this year, she shared another photo which she captioned: ‚ÄúWho says you can‚Äôt stay fit when pregnant ?!‚Äù.

Certainly, not us!

Prenatal yoga has always been a favourite of A-listers as it believed to keep limbs toned, improve balance and circulation, and make labour easier. Actually, it is considered as one of the best forms of exercise during pregnancy. Here‚Äôs why:

1) Prenatal yoga increases stamina and helps maintain balance. With the growth of a life inside the mother, more energy and strength is needed to function and yoga strengthens the hips, back, arms and shoulders. It also helps maintain balance physically and aids in emotional growth. A 2012 University of Michigan study showed that mindfulness yoga, which combines physical poses with meditation practices, can bring measurable relief to women who may face depression during pregnancy.

2) Prenatal yoga prepares for the birth of the child by focusing on relaxation and breathing techniques. This works as a good tool for labour during contractions because deep breathing can regulate blood pressure and heart rate and provide the much-needed oxygen to your baby and your muscles.

3) It increases circulation within the joints and muscles with regular practice, which, in turn, reduces swelling caused during pregnancy and increases immunity. It also calms the nervous system through deep breathing which benefits the body with an improved digestive system, and good sleep.

4) Common pregnancy complaints like lower back pain, nausea, insomnia, headaches, shortness of breath, and carpal tunnel syndrome can be reduced with regular practice. Like we have said earlier, stretching and toning the muscles help in improved blood circulation.

5) It‚Äôs a good way to channelise attention towards what‚Äôs going on within your bodies. Certain poses, like the Hero pose, in which you are required to sit back on your heels and then sit up straight to lengthen your spine, can become meaningful and a good way to connect with your unborn child.

Lasith Malinga: Sling without the sting,"Sri Lanka‚Äôs Lasith Malinga is Sri Lanka‚Äôs senior-most bowler in the ODI series. (PTI Photo) Sri Lanka‚Äôs Lasith Malinga is Sri Lanka‚Äôs senior-most bowler in the ODI series. (PTI Photo)

Lasith Malinga put a blue plastic marker at yorker length and went full tilt. ‚ÄòLaying down the marker‚Äô to achieve the desired length is a common method for the fast bowlers. But Malinga‚Äôs training session at the Pallekele International Stadium on Wednesday, ahead of the second ODI, exuded a sort of match intensity. From a distance of about 75 yards, it felt like it was a desperate attempt to find those yorkers again.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs senior-most bowler, a limited-overs legend, has looked a pale shadow of his former self ever since his return to the ODIs following an 18-month knee injury lay-off. Batters used to dread his yorkers earlier. Now they sometimes take the mickey out of him, like Virat Kohli did in the penultimate over of the first ODI in Dambulla. It was Malinga‚Äôs 200th ODI and he conceded 52 runs in eight overs without a wicket.

Dambulla wasn‚Äôt a case in isolation. Between his ODI debut in July 2004 and November 2015, when he suffered a bone bruise on his left knee, Malinga had 291 wickets in 191 matches including seven five-fors. Over the past three-and-a-half months after his return, the fast bowler, who will turn 34 on Monday, has only seven scalps in nine matches with an average of 61.71. His career average is 28.57.

Faced with questions related to Malinga‚Äôs waning prowess, Sri Lanka coach Nic Pothas tried to put things in perspective. ‚ÄúSince the Champions Trophy, Lasith had nine catches dropped off his bowling. So his stats would look differently (without those dropped catches). The game against Pakistan (in the Champions Trophy), we could have won it easily if we held those catches.‚Äù

Three catches were dropped off Malinga‚Äôs bowling in that win-or-bust game that saw Pakistan scrape through to the knockouts and go on to win the tournament. In his first over, Danushka Gunathilaka grassed Azhar Ali, with the batsman yet to open his account. But the slips towards the back end of the innings proved more costly. Chasing 237 for victory, Pakistan were 193/7 after 38 overs, when Malinga returned for his third spell. Third ball of the over was slower on the middle stump that outfoxed Sarfraz Ahmed, who spooned a simple catch to Thisara Perera at mid-on. The fielder somehow managed to grass it. Malinga attempted a slower bouncer in his next over and Sarfraz top-edged it to deep square leg. Running in about 10 yards and diving forward, Seekkuge Prasanna couldn‚Äôt hold on to the chance. Sarfraz remained unbeaten on 61 to take Pakistan to the semifinal as Sri Lanka crashed out. Even in the first ODI against India, Sri Lanka captain Upul Tharanga dropped Shikhar Dhawan off Malinga. But by then, the batsman had raced to 118 and the game was done and dusted. In between, Sri Lankan fielders had dropped a few more off their premier fast bowler during their 3-2 home series loss against Zimbabwe.

All said and done, Malinga has now become a touchy subject in Sri Lankan cricket. The sports minister rapped him and the whole team over the lack of fitness after the Champions Trophy. He now generally bowls medium pace and stretches between almost every delivery as the match progresses.

Coach‚Äôs backing

Pothas and Tharanga didn‚Äôt deny Malinga‚Äôs slide, but backed the veteran quick. ‚ÄúMalinga‚Äôs form has gone down from what it was two-three years ago. Any cricketer goes through this phase. He returned to ODIs after being out for about 18 months. But since his return, he has been unable to produce those match-winning performances; mainly because catches have been dropped off his bowling. But his presence in the team is a big boon to the young fast bowlers who can learn a lot from him,‚Äù Tharanga said at the pre-match presser that started off with the team management reading out a joint statement and the Sri Lanka Cricket media head asking the scribes to limit the question-answer session to the second ODI only. Kohli, too, agrees that after a point age becomes a factor. At the same time, however, he pointed out that this could just be a lean patch for Malinga. ‚ÄúObviously, age is always a factor in sport. I cannot speak for Lasith but everyone wants to keep up with their peak fitness and manage their bodies well through the course of their career,‚Äù he said.

Kohli, in fact, was sympathetic to him. ‚ÄúWhen you look at his bowling action and the kind of success he has had for such a long period of time is actually remarkable. With the dynamics of his bowling, it‚Äôs not very natural. It‚Äôs very easy to say that he is not bowling as well anymore, but it could just be a phase,‚Äù the India captain added. Somehow, Malinga didn‚Äôt look this stale during his 12 matches for Mumbai Indians in the last IPL, where he picked 11 wickets at an economy rate of 8.52. But T20 cricket is only four overs per game for a bowler and the Sri Lankan had Jasprit Bumrah and Mitchell McClenaghan for company.

When he plays for his national team, Malinga is Sri Lanka‚Äôs only strike bowler upfront, and at the death. And unless he regains his mojo, it‚Äôs going to be downhill for the hosts in this series. Sri Lanka have to win two out of the five matches to secure direct qualification for the 2019 World Cup.

North Korea‚Äôs self-defensive nuclear deterrence arsenal will never be on the negotiating table, a Pyongyang envoy said on Tuesday.

"At 153kg, this GIANT SAMOSA is the world‚Äôs LARGEST","Want to feast on the giant samosa? You‚Äôll have to forget the calories. (Source: Catrin Nye/Twitter) Want to feast on the giant samosa? You‚Äôll have to forget the calories. (Source: Catrin Nye/Twitter)

Love crispy fried samosas filled with spicy potatoes and onions? Look no further, because a giant samosa is here to satiate your hunger pangs! Smashing all records, a king-sized samosa weighing 153.1kg has earned the tag of being the world‚Äôs largest. The gigantic snack was made by a dozen volunteers from the Muslim Aid UK charity and then deep-fried in a custom-built vat at East London Mosque. Wondering how it was prepared? Built on a giant wire mesh, it was lifted up into a vat of hot cooking oil before being taken out and weighed.

People from the Guinness Book of World Records were also present to critique and certify the mega-samosa. Adjudicator Pravin Patel spelled out the rules and told AFP that it‚Äôs got to be ‚Äútriangular; contain flour, potatoes, onions and peas; be fried, and retain the shape when cooked‚Äù. Not just that, he also said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got to look and feel like a samosa; it‚Äôs got to be edible by humans. The critical record is the net weight. Plus it all has to be eaten. No wastage!‚Äù

The team kept all the conditions in mind and prepared the massive snack. Project organiser Farid Islam told the agency that it was very tense and his heart was beating all the time. ‚ÄúIt looked like it was going to slide off. A crack appeared and I feared the worst,‚Äù the 26-year-old added.

Once it was all done, it went on to be weighed. The independent food safety officer, who had overseen proceedings, gave it the taste test and left scores of people cheering with a thumbs up for the intriguing record. The previous record of 110.8kg was set by Bradford College in northern England in June 2012.

After 15 hours of struggle, when the green light was given, Patel expressed his delight and let out his worst fears. ‚ÄúInitially I thought it would be a piece of cake: stuff it together, tie up the end and fry it. When I realised there was not a single pot in the country that could hold that weight, we had to get something tailor made,‚Äù he said. The samosa was then distributed among the homeless locals via the Salvation Army.

Right to privacy judgment: A timeline of the case,"The apex court decided on right to privacy as a fundamental right on Thursday. The apex court decided on right to privacy as a fundamental right on Thursday.

The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that right to privacy is a fundamental right under the Constitution of India. The Bench of nine judges stated that right to privacy shall be a part of Article 21 (right to life and liberty) of the Constitution.

Here is the timeline of the case:

July 21, 2015: A Bench of Justices J. Chelameswar, S.A. Bobde and C. Nagappan passed an interim order on September 23, 2013, making Aadhaar voluntary. But in 2015 the apex court observed that making Aadhaar mandatory was in violation of the Supreme Court‚Äôs order passed in 2013.

July 22, 2015: Former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, on behalf of the Centre, suggested the Court that a separate bench should hear the issues relating to right to privacy and constitutionality of the UID programme and hence a larger bench should hear the particular contentions.

August 6, 2015: The Supreme Court questioned the Centre‚Äôs stand on right to privacy not being a fundamental right. Rohatgi submitted that right to privacy was not explicitly stated in the Constitution as a fundamental right and suggested the court that this matter be heard by a nine-judge bench. Centre relied on previous judgments, which cited that right to privacy was not a fundamental right and informed the court that no other judgment had overruled the same.

August 11, 2015: A Bench of three judges passed an interim order on the Aadhaar-privacy matter and passed three important orders. The Supreme Court made Aadhaar voluntary and removed the mandate to provide an Aadhaar card for availing benefits. The apex court further linked the use of Aadhaar in PDS and LPG distribution and distribution of personal information was made illegal.

October 7, 2015: Despite Centre‚Äôs vigorous plea to modify the inerim order, Supreme Court did not agree to link Aadhaar cards with the Digital India initiative and services such as banking and telecom. Justice J. Chelameswar directed Centre to raise its plea to the Constitutional bench when formed.

October 8, 2015: The then Chief Justice of India H.L. Dattu decided to set up another Constitution Bench to look into the issue relating to privacy in the Aadhaar matter.

April 25, 2016: Jairam Ramesh challenged the introduction of Aadhaar as a money bill and the Aadhaar Act, 2016 came under the Supreme Court scanner.

October 15, 2015: The Bench of five judges permitted the government to use Aadhaar for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), National Social Assistance Programme (Old Age Pensions, Widow Pensions, Disability Pensions) Prime Minister‚Äôs Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO).

March 27, 2017: Chief Justice of India J.S. Khehar observed that Aadhaar can be ‚Äúpressed‚Äù for all ‚Äúnon-benefit‚Äù plans where questions of entitlements do not occur like opening a bank account or filing Income Tax returns. Recently, the Finance Bill had made Aadhaar mandatory for filing tax returns and a permanent account number (PAN) under Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

April 27, 2017: The Division Bench of Justice A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan heard PILs challenging the constitutionality of Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act under the Finance Act, 2017. Arvind Datar, counsel for the petitioner, stated that the said provision was meant to check black money and weed out fraudulent PANs. The court observed that it cannot interfere in a law brought out by the Parliament and listed the matter for a further date.

May 19, 2017: The Supreme Court had heard a petition seeking interim relief from providing Aadhaar cards to avail benefits of 17 social schemes. The Cantre had urged the bench to hear the plea before June 30, deadline put by the government on providing Aadhaar. Seeking an interim stay on the deadline put by the government, Shyam Divan, counsel for the petitioner, brought to Court‚Äôs that despite the directions given by the court making Aadhaar voluntary, the Centre had released various notification making it mandatory. Divan pressed the matter‚Äôs urgency to be heard and the Court listed the matter on June 27, three days before the said deadline.

June 9, 2017: The apex court stated that it would refrain from entering into the issue of right to privacy relating to the Aadhaar matter and noted the apprehension of Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act. The Supreme Court left the issue of right to privacy involving sharing of biometric data under the Aadhaar scheme to the Constitution Bench.

August 2, 2017: The arguments regarding the right to privacy commenced on July 19 and lasted for six days before the bench of nine judges. The Supreme Court reserved the order on the issue on August 2.

Here‚Äôs why your adolescent kid is at high obesity risk,"Stopping children from eating high calorie food may not prevent obesity. (Source: Thinkstockphotos) Stopping children from eating high calorie food may not prevent obesity. (Source: Thinkstockphotos)

Don‚Äôt blame your adolescent kid for eating high calorie food ‚Äî he or she may not be able to control the urge for burgers, pizzas and french fries due to an impairment in a brain region linked to self-regulation, says a study.

The findings have revealed that adolescents, who are at an increased risk of obesity, have progressively less neural activity in circuits of the brain that support self-regulation and attention.

‚ÄúThe study establishes that risk for obesity isn‚Äôt driven exclusively by the absence or presence of urges to eat high-calorie foods, but also, and perhaps most importantly, by the ability to control those urges,‚Äù said Bradley Peterson, Professor at the University of Southern California.

For the study, reported in the journal NeuroImage, the team used fMRI to observe relationship between neurological activity and risk for obesity in overweight compared with lean adolescents.

In adolescents who were obese or who were lean but at high familial risk for obesity, they observed less activation in attention and self-regulation circuits. Brain circuits that support attention and self-regulation showed the greatest activation in lean/low-risk adolescents, less activity in lean/high-risk participants and least activation in the overweight/obese group.

Nearly 48 hours are left for the verdict in the rape case against Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda Chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, but the roads and public parks in Panchkula around the Sector 1 CBI Court are already filled with hordes of his followers ‚Äì praying for a favourable verdict and waiting for the godman‚Äôs appearance in the city. The number rose to thousands on Wednesday.

‚ÄúNo one has directed us to come here. It is the faith that has brought us here. Wherever Babaji goes, we follow him. My life is because of him and whatever he says, I will do,‚Äù said Gurpreet Singh (18), a Class XII student from Patiala, managing the crowd and vehicle parking outside the Naam Charcha Ghar at Sector 23 with a stick in his hand.

While there is no official figures of how many followers have managed to enter Panchkula till Wednesday evening, sources within the Dera say the number has already swelled to 50K, who have already spread themselves across sectors close to the CBI Court. The followers have put up in parks, on roads under the shadow of trees and even the tunnels of Zirakpur-Panchkula flyover.

Despite the police presence and restrictions in and around the city, the followers on Wednesday shifted base from the Sector 23 Naam Charcha Ghar to parks and roads close to the Tau Devi Lal Stadium ‚Äì which is within a few kilometres of the trial court. By evening, the followers had even occupied the parks at Sector 2 ‚Äì adjacent to Sector 1 where the court is located.

The followers ‚Äì many with their whole families ‚Äì carrying bags containing clothes, food, water and essential items say they do not know what the verdict would be or when they would have to return to their villages. By evening, the Dera followers pitched a tent inside the park close to the stadium.

Those who arrive in the city are not just coming from Punjab, Haryana or Chandigarh but many believers of the godman reached here even from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. After de-boarding at various bus stops and the railway station, the followers move in groups towards sectors close to the court.

‚ÄúOn Tuesday, I saw on television that the verdict is coming on Friday. I couldn‚Äôt wait and boarded a bus. I am here since yesterday night and will not leave till I hear the news that Babaji is freed of all charges,‚Äù said Harpeet Singh, a Bathinda resident, whose family has been associated with the sect for the last 16 years. He quickly adds, ‚ÄúIf something wrong is announced, I will sacrifice my life for Babaji. Enough of peace!‚Äù Ask him the reason for the sacrifice and Singh says, ‚ÄúBabaji has helped me when my life was running through a financial turmoil. My entire family is indebted to him. Like me, there are thousands of people who have been helped by Babaji.‚Äù

At the Sector 23 park, a quiet censorship on the followers on talking to media was also visible. ‚ÄúSimran karte raho (Keep praying). If any journalist comes, tell them to talk to the seniors,‚Äù says a woman coordinator, who refused to reveal the reason for her advice to the followers.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where the court is located. Our leader told us that we have to sit in this park for the next two days,‚Äù said Reenu from Ganga Nagar. She, alongwith her seven-year-old child, reached Panchkula on Wednesday morning. ‚ÄúI took one set of clothes for me and my son. I know the charges against Pitaji are wrong.

The British Library is digitising rare printed Bengali books,"To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo) To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. (Source: File Photo)

The British Library, which is leading an international partnership to digitise rare material from its South Asian printed book collection, has scanned 1,000 old and rare printed Bengali books of the 19th century, according to project co-ordinators.

As part of the ‚ÄòTwo Centuries of Indian Print‚Äô (TCIP) project, in total, 4,000 early printed Bengali books, amounting to more than 800,000 pages, will be digitised and made freely available online.

‚ÄúSo far we scanned 1,000 books. There are books literally from every discipline you could think of. There are treatises on sciences, education, religion, missionaries coming to India and translation of the Bible,‚Äù Tom Derrick, Digital Curator, TCIP told IANS here at the Jadavpur University on the sidelines of a symposium exploring the history of print in South Asia.

The TCIP pilot project is a partnership between the British Library, the School of Cultural Texts and Records (SCTR) of Jadavpur University, Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, and the Library at SOAS University of London, involving collaborations with the National Library of India.

It marks the start of a major programme to share the wealth of Indian printed books held by the British Library dating from 1713 to 1914. Another aspect to the project is applying OCR (optical character recognition) to transcribe the Bengali script. OCR is the recognition of printed or written text characters by a computer.

‚ÄúWe are dealing with historical Bangla and the changes in the language, so the typography is unique. It is underserved by commercial OCR whose focus is more on Western patterns,‚Äù explained Derrick.

To overcome these challenges, the library is running a competition to find an optimal solution for automatically transcribing the Bengali books that have been digitised as part of the project. ‚ÄúSo over 20 institutes worldwide have signed up,‚Äù he said. According to Layli Uddin, project curator (Bengali) at the British Library, the approach is three-pronged: cataloguing, digitising and contextualising.

‚ÄúWe want to reach out to a wider audience, make the materials open and free to all, make it accessible to non-Bengali speaking audiences as well. Also to contextualise and that is where the Jadavpur University experts come in. They are helping identify what is unique and rare in BL‚Äôs collectionsa printed materials which are not available elsewhere in the world,‚Äù Uddin told IANS.

Abhijit Gupta, joint director, SCTR, says the the thinner the book, the rarer they are.

‚ÄúThe British Library used a unique mechanisma they used to bind together thin books to preserve them. One of the rare books that is part of the project is ‚ÄòAdvice for Railway Travellers‚Äô which gives information on railway schedule after the advent of railways. The point of digitising is to access part of the landscape which we know exists but we can‚Äôt seea they are in libraries across the world.‚Äù added Gupta.

"Privacy, dignity, sexual autonomy","The right to privacy was a constitutionally accepted and applied right recognised by an interpretative device of the Supreme Court since 1975. The right to privacy was a constitutionally accepted and applied right recognised by an interpretative device of the Supreme Court since 1975.

One of the lowest points in the history of the Indian Supreme Court has been when during the proclamation of Emergency, it refused to enforce fundamental rights. By its decision in ADM Jabalpur v. Shivakant Shukla the court agreed with the government to suspend fundamental rights thereby permitting it to hold people in detention, without any opportunity to move court. More importantly, it gave wide police powers to the government to pursue state interests at the cost of fundamental rights. This very tension between the government and the individual came into play in the right to privacy hearings which have delivered a historic judgement.

The right to privacy was a constitutionally accepted and applied right recognised by an interpretative device of the Supreme Court since 1975. Over the decades, more than 30 decisions of the apex court applied privacy as a bundle of rights that permitted liberty of thought and action. Some instances include safeguards against indiscriminate phone tapping, narco analysis and even bodily integrity. However, about two years ago, this was thrown into doubt when in the midst of the hearings of the Aadhaar case the government disputed the very basis of the right to privacy. To be fair, this was a technical argument that required an answer due to judicial propriety, though it lacked substantive merit. Yesterday, nine judges of the Supreme Court said in one voice and six judgements, that the right to privacy is inherent in our fundamental rights.

Lawyers will, over the next few weeks, spend substantial time debating its reasoning but there are a few noticeable features which are clearly evident. The constitutional right to privacy is no longer in any dispute and stands on firm ground. Its breadth is established over the entire chapter of fundamental rights, which include equality, free expression, right to life, religion. This also means the Aadhaar cases will now proceed for arguments on their merits which were gridlocked due to this pending decision. But this case goes far beyond Aadhaar and holds the promise of renewing the vitality of the complete spectrum of civil liberties. For instance, the judgement quite clearly establishes the link between privacy, dignity and sexual autonomy. In doing this, it undercuts the basis of another dark stain on the history of the court when three years ago in the Suresh Koushal v. Naz Foundation case, the court refused to strike down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. It is now only matter of time when the case will be formally overruled.

The basis of this is a key recognition of the nature of privacy being a natural right. The Supreme Court, by stating that the state does not bestow privacy, also has limited its ability to take it away. While recognising that even natural rights are subject to limitations, high thresholds are prescribed. This follows the reasoning of Justice H.R. Khanna in the ADM. Jabalpur case who wrote the sole dissent at a time when confronting the government with constitutionalism seemed impractical. Justice Khanna put his ascendance to the chair of the Chief Justice of India in peril by stating that the government of the day could not destroy fundamental rights. But losing against the majority he fashioned his dissent as an, ‚Äúappeal to the brooding spirit of the law, to the intelligence of a future day‚Äù. This was an act of constitutional principle and judicial courage. Recognising his call, our Supreme Court has finally overruled ADM Jabalpur, but will our court assimilated the principles of constitutionalism?

While the privacy judgement is a cause for celebration, its full benefit will only come when it is applied to actual state actions that undermine privacy. Adherence to constitutional principle is not an academic exercise, but requires a prompt protection of real rights and liberties. Judicial action should spring at moments when the state oversteps onto the citizen. Few would dispute that determinations on privacy would be of greater benefit when the Supreme Court protects us with foresight rather than retrospect.

It is necessary to recognise that the government has not only wagered the right to privacy in the Supreme Court but has taken various measures to threaten it. Hence, the true test of the privacy judgement will be in its subsequent application to state actions when it sets boundaries and provides safeguards. This includes the Aadhaar batch of decisions which have not been comprehensively heard for more than two years. If the Supreme Court has to truly secure liberty it has to overrule ADM Jabalpur both in practice and principle.

Switzerland is known for many things, from snow-capped mountains to Swiss chocolates, there is no dearth of reasons why one must visit the magical place. And to top that, it has now officially opened the world‚Äôs ‚Äòlongest‚Äô suspension bridge. The 494m-long pedestrian hanging bridge is perfect for hikers and for wanderers who love to explore nature at its best. But, it is not for the faint-hearted. The adventurous walk down the ‚ÄòEuropabruecke‚Äô bridge, connecting Gr√§chen and Zermatt, is at a ‚Äúdizzying height‚Äù, according to the Zermatt tourism board website.

The bridge is located along the Europaweg trail offers views of the Matterhorn, Weisshorn and the Bernese Alps mountains. The bridge will also provide an opportunity for travellers to witness the highest mountains in Switzerland the Dom (4,545m).

However, along with breathtaking view, it could literally take away the breath of people with vertigo. ‚ÄúThe path runs between 1,600m and 2,200m above sea level and high above the deepest cut valley in Switzerland,‚Äù the tourism board added.

Armed group stopping migrant boats leaving Libya,"July and August are peak months for migrant boats because of favourable sea conditions. (Source: AP) July and August are peak months for migrant boats because of favourable sea conditions. (Source: AP)

An armed group is stopping migrant boats from setting off across the Mediterranean from a city west of Tripoli that has been a springboard for people smugglers, causing a sudden drop in departures over the past month, sources in the area said. The revelation throws new light on the sharp reduction in migrant arrivals from Italy, which took over from the Aegean route as the main focus of European concerns in the crisis.

Arrivals in Italy from North Africa, the main route for migration to Europe this year, dropped by more than 50 percent in July from a year earlier, and August arrivals so far are down even further. July and August are peak months for migrant boats because of favourable sea conditions. Sources in Sabratha, 70 km (45 miles) west of the capital, said the sudden drop had been caused by a new force in the seaside city, which is preventing migrants from leaving, often by locking them up.

The group in Sabratha ‚Äúworks on the ground, the beach, to prevent the migrants leaving on boats towards Italy,‚Äù said a civil society organiser from the city, speaking on condition of anonymity. The group is made up of several hundred ‚Äúcivilians, policemen, army figures,‚Äù he said. It is conducting a ‚Äúvery strong campaign‚Äù that was launched by a ‚Äúformer mafia boss‚Äù, said a second Sabratha source who follows smuggling activity closely. A third source with contacts in Libya, who also asked not to be named, said the Sabratha group was making ‚Äúa significant effort to police the area‚Äù. The two Sabratha sources said the group was running a detention centre for migrants who are turned back or taken from smugglers. One sent a picture of hundreds of migrants sitting in the sand in front of a high wall.

One of the sources said he thought the group was seeking legitimacy and financial support from Tripoli, where European states have tried to partner with a U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) to stem migrant flows. An official from the interior ministry‚Äôs department for combating illegal migration in Sabratha did not respond to a request for comment. It was not possible to contact the group, which the third source said was called Brigade 48, although other sources did not confirm this. Italy has been trying to bolster the GNA‚Äôs ability to stop people smuggling with cash, training and by sending a ship to help repair Tripoli‚Äôs coastguard and navy vessels. Some 600,000 migrants have reached Italy by sea from North Africa since 2014, testing the country‚Äôs ability to cope. More than 12,000 have died trying.

Most leave from Libya‚Äôs western coast. Following a local backlash against smugglers in Zuwara in the west in 2015, Sabratha became the most frequently used departure point. Italy wants to replicate a deal with Libya that the EU struck with Turkey last year, largely shutting down the migrant route through Greece and the Balkans. With a national election looming during the first half of next year, the government in Rome is under pressure to show it can stop, or at least slow, migration.

But any progress in Libya is likely to be fragile, with the country in a state of conflict since Muammar Gaddafi was ousted six years ago. Rival governments are vying for power and local militias battle each other for territory and smuggling profits. Last week Italy seized on the drop in arrivals, with Interior Minister Marco Minniti saying he saw a ‚Äúlight at the end of the tunnel‚Äù.

LEAVING POINT SHIFTS

Migrants rescued last week in the Mediterranean confirmed that conditions had changed in Sabratha, according to a spokesman at the International Organization for Migration, which interviewed migrants who arrived in Trapani, Sicily, on Saturday. ‚ÄúThey said that it was very difficult to depart from Sabratha. There are people stopping the boats before they set out, and if they get out to sea they‚Äôre immediately sent back,‚Äù said Flavio Di Giacomo, an IOM spokesman in Rome. Some migrants were also turned back before reaching Sabratha, he said. The European Union‚Äôs border control agency Frontex last week said ‚Äúclashes in Sabratha‚Äù contributed to July‚Äôs decline, also citing changeable weather and increased Libyan coastguard presence. The Sabratha sources were not aware of any clashes.

Another shift in recent weeks has been a clampdown on smuggling of Bangladeshi and North African migrants through Tripoli‚Äôs Mitiga airport, after a militia that controlled the trade was forced out by a GNA-aligned armed group at the start of July, Libyan and European officials said. But that, like a slowing of flows into Libya through Niger, might take time to take effect. Hundreds of thousands of migrants are already in Libya. In Sabratha, the changes may not stick. In the past, with no central authority to constrain them, smugglers have adapted and routes have shifted, as already is happening.

Last week smugglers moved departures to east of Tripoli, near Al Khoms, Chris Catrambone, co-founder of the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) charity, told Reuters. Three large rubber boats set out from the east, he said, while only a small boat with 26 people was found west of Tripoli. ‚ÄúThe sea was like a lake last week and yet there were few boats,‚Äù Catrambone said. Everyone on the Phoenix, a rescue vessel operated by MOAS, was taken aback because it was so unusual, he said.

The GNA has little control over armed groups in western Libya, including the capital, and none over factions that control the east of the country. The civil society member from Sabratha said the new group there might stop working if it does not receive support from Tripoli. The power of the smuggling networks would not be broken until there was a ‚Äúlegitimate source of order‚Äù in Libya, said a senior diplomat, speaking of the change in Tripoli airport and comparing the situation to broken vase. ‚ÄúIn one corner we stuck it together, but everything else is in pieces.‚Äù

Uttar Pradesh Council bypoll on Sept 15; CM Yogi Adityanath may take Upper House route,"UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. (File) UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. (File)

The Election Commission on Thursday announced the bypoll schedule for four vacant seats of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council, which might enable Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to take the Upper House route to enter the legislature before a six-month window expires next month. Adityanath, who took over as the chief minister on March 19, has to become a legislator within six months of assuming office and the deadline expires on September 19.

According to an Election Commission release, the issuance of notification will be done on August 29, while September 5 is the last date for filing nominations.

Scrutiny of nominations will be done on September 6, and the last date for withdrawal of candidature is September 8. Polling will be held on September 15, counting of votes will also be done on September 15 and the election will be completed before September 18.

Besides Adityanath, deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, and ministers Swatantra Dev Singh and Mohsin Raza are not member of either of the two Houses.

Adityanath and Maurya are still members of the Lok Sabha.

All of them have to get elected to either the assembly or the legislative council before September 19 ‚Äî when they complete six months ‚Äî in order to continue as ministers.

If Adityanath chooses the council route, he will become the third successive chief minister, after Akhilesh Yadav (SP) and Mayawati (BSP), to become member of the upper house.

The four seats for which bypolls will be held were vacated by MLCs Bukkal Nawab, Yashwant, Sarojini Agarwal and Ashok Bajpai, all members of the Samajwadi Party (SP).

On August 9, SP MLC Ashok Bajpai resigned from the Legislative Council, taking the number of party MLCs who have quit recently to four.

Three of the SP MLCs, who had resigned, have already joined the BJP.

On August 19, Bajpai joined the BJP, taking the total number of former MLCs, who had resigned last month from the House, to do so to five.

Former SP MLCs Sarojini Agrawal, Bukkal Nawab and Yashwant Singh, and Thakur Jaiveer Singh, formerly a BSP MLC, joined the ruling party earlier.

On August 4, SP MLC Sarojini Agarwal resigned from the Legislative Council membership and joined the BJP.

Three sitting MLCs Bukkal Nawab and Yashwant Singh (both Samajwadi Party) and Thakur Jaiveer Singh (BSP) had resigned from the membership of the upper house on July 29 coinciding with the visit of BJP president Amit Shah to the state capital.

The resignation of five MLCs including (four of the SP and one BSP) assumes significance as the saffron party has to take a decision on five of its ministers in Uttar Pradesh, including the chief minister, as none of them is a member of either of the two Houses.

The other UP chief ministers who opted for the Legislative Council route are Narain Dutt Tiwari, after he was shifted from the Centre, and late Ram Prakash Gupta (BJP).

Former chief minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh had become a member of UP Legislative Council in November 1980 after assuming the chief minister‚Äôs office in June 1980. He later contested a by-election from Tindwari assembly constituency, and became a member of UP Legislative Assembly in 1981.

Cabinet approval for panel to study quotas within OBC quota,"Arun Jaitley said the intent is to ensure a ‚Äúmore equitable distribution amongst the OBCs themselves‚Äô‚Äô so that those that get left behind in the broader classification in every state are able to get benefits meant for the community. (Source: PTI/File) Arun Jaitley said the intent is to ensure a ‚Äúmore equitable distribution amongst the OBCs themselves‚Äô‚Äô so that those that get left behind in the broader classification in every state are able to get benefits meant for the community. (Source: PTI/File)

THE UNION Cabinet Wednesday approved the setting up of a commission to examine the sub-categorisation of almost 5,000 castes in the central list of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) to ensure a ‚Äúmore equitable distribution‚Äù of reservations in central government jobs and educational institutions.

‚ÄúUnder Article 340 of the Constitution, the President would be recommended to constitute a commission that would examine the central list of OBC and sub-categorise it. The proposal is that there will be sub-categorisation within the OBC list for the purposes of central government employment,‚Äô‚Äô Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said after a meeting of the Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Indian Express had first reported on August 14 about this proposed move by the government. Announcing that the Cabinet has approved the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Jaitley said that the former National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) as well as a Parliamentary Standing Committee had recommended such a sub-classification. ‚ÄúWe have accepted this after inter-ministerial consultation,‚Äô‚Äô he said.

Jaitley said the intent is to ensure a ‚Äúmore equitable distribution amongst the OBCs themselves‚Äô‚Äô so that those that get left behind in the broader classification in every state are able to get benefits meant for the community. Once the chairperson of the new commission is appointed, it will have 12 weeks to submit its report. Its terms of reference include examining ‚Äúthe extent of inequitable distribution of benefits‚Äù among OBCs with reference to the Central list. It will also have to evolve a scientific methodology and classify the OBCs into sub-categories.

In its report submitted in March 2015, the former NCBC under Justice Eswaraiah had advocated sub-categorisation within the OBCs. Citing Article 14, the report had noted that un-equals cannot be treated equally and have to be brought on par with advanced classes. It had asked for sub-categorisation within OBCs into Extremely Backward Classes (Group ‚ÄòA‚Äô), More Backward Classes (Group ‚ÄòB‚Äô) and Backward Classes (Group ‚ÄòC‚Äô). The Cabinet decision is likely to build upon this suggestion.

In 2015, the NCBC had also sought the approval of the Government to undertake the exercise ‚Äúto avoid lumping so that one or two such classes do not eat away the entire quota leaving the other backward classes high and dry‚Äô‚Äô. It had said that the ICSSR should be roped in to study state-wise lists with reference to traditional occupation, and social, educational and economic backwardness.

At present, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry, Karnataka, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, as well as the Jammu region, have such a sub-categorisation in place for their state list of OBCs for employment in the state government. However, there is no such sub-categorisation in some of the bigger states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Likewise, there is no such sub-categorisation in the central OBC list.

The latest decision comes over 25 years after the implementation of the Mandal Commission report, and is being seen as a political move that seeks to widen the BJP‚Äôs appeal among non-dominant castes among OBCs. Welcoming the move, BJP president Amit Shah said, ‚ÄúThe sub-categorisation will help prioritise castes within the OBCs that need reservation and other benefits because of their economic backwardness.‚Äù

On Monday, Shah had asked BJP chief ministers to ‚Äúexpose‚Äù the Opposition Congress‚Äôs alleged intent to stall legislation to grant constitutional status to the NCBC in the monsoon session of Parliament that concluded recently. ‚ÄúIn several states, the benefits meant for OBCs, such as reservations in government jobs and educational institutions, are cornered by the dominant OBC groups. For instance, the Yadavs in UP, Jats in Rajasthan, Thevars and Gounders in Tamil Nadu or Kurmis in Madhya Pradesh have all been more advanced OBC groups in their respective states,‚Äô‚Äô said a Government official.

The official said that this commission is being appointed according to Article 340 under which the Mandal commission, which recommended 27 per cent reservation for socially and educationally backward classes, was appointed.

In its proposal, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment had cited the landmark 1992 Supreme Court order in the Indira Sawhney vs Union of India case, which said that there is no Constitutional bar to a state further classifying backward classes based on degrees of social backwardness.

Against this backdrop, the proposed sub-categorisation at the national level could be the most radical move since the V P Singh government accepted the Mandal Commission‚Äôs recommendations in 1989. A quota within quota is considered to be the next stage ‚Äî Mandal 2.0 ‚Äî of reservation for OBCs.

‚ÄúIt was a very tough match and even though I played well, I must I must admit that I had luck on my side today. I am very thrilled with the outcome and the victory will for sure give me a lot of confidence going ahead in the tournament,‚Äù Sai said after the match. ‚ÄúI was getting caught initially as the shuttle speed was very slow and he was playing very fast. I could not match him initially but slowly adjusted to his speed. He is a tough player and his game has improved a lot since I last played him. I am really happy to win and now I am focused on my next match,‚Äù he further added.

‚ÄúI am going through the best phase of my career and I am confident that if I could continue the way I have been playing, I would do very well in the tournament,‚Äù the 25-year-old added.

Udaipur‚Äôs Kalpit Veerwal in Limca book of records for 100 per cent in JEE-Mains,"Veerwal scored 360 out of 360 in the JEE-Mains this year and is now studying Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.

"Rolling back Taliban grip on Afghan territory key aim of Trump plan, says official","US Marine stands next to an Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier during a training in Helmand province, Afghanistan. (Source: Reuters) US Marine stands next to an Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier during a training in Helmand province, Afghanistan. (Source: Reuters)

Rolling back territorial gains by the Taliban and strengthening the Afghanistan army‚Äôs ability to fight will be two key objectives of President Donald Trump‚Äôs new strategy for the country, a senior administration official said on Tuesday. Trump, in a televised speech on Monday, promised a stepped-up military campaign against Taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the US-backed Afghan government.

In outlining his strategy to give the US military more authority to make battlefield decisions, Trump did not provide a timetable for determining whether the mission is a success or how commanders would be able to judge progress.

The senior administration official said, however, that one general measure of progress was assessing how much and what territory is controlled by the Afghan government or by the Taliban and other extremist groups such as Islamic State‚Äôs Afghan affiliate.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also the estimated number of fighters, the presence of al Qaeda and ISIS, how strong are they, how many fighters do they have, how are their training camps, what are their finance networks like,‚Äù the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Also key will be the effectiveness of the Afghan army and whether US-led armed forces can help it seize control of some territory held by the Taliban, the official added.

Trump, who was reluctant to approve a deeper engagement in Afghanistan after 16 years of war, wanted to keep a close eye on whether progress is being made, the official said.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to be taking the temperature continuously,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we expect to see any real gains materialize for at least six months. But from that point on, it‚Äôs going to be something that we essentially never stop evaluating.‚Äù

US-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban‚Äôs hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington that year.

US forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three American presidents. About 2,400 US troops have died there in America‚Äôs longest military conflict.

‚ÄòPROGRESSIVE PROCESS‚Äô

Three US officials said on Tuesday the administration had yet to settle on specific metrics to measure progress in Afghanistan and assess the contributions of the Afghan government, Pakistan, India and America‚Äôs NATO allies.

One of the officials said there was no point ‚Äúin setting specific targets, much less making them public, because that would risk making our partners think that once they had met those marks, they didn‚Äôt have to do more.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre after is a progressive process,‚Äù the official said, ‚Äúso for example the Afghan security forces keep improving their capabilities until they don‚Äôt need us anymore, the government in Kabul keeps improving its record on eliminating corruption and improving local, regional and national governance.‚Äù

But Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, struck a critical tone on Tuesday.

‚ÄúWhile a ‚Äòconditions based‚Äô approach is appealing to military leaders because it gives the Taliban less certainty about how long it will take to wait us out, it also diminishes pressure on the

Afghan government to reform itself and give the Afghan people something worth fighting for, since it indicates a willingness to bail them out indefinitely,‚Äù Schiff said in a statement.

Onus is on all players to find the spark and a little bit extra: Matthew Mott,"Ellyse Perry scored a crucial 71 run knock against New Zealand in the recently concluded Women‚Äôs World Cup. (Source: Reuters) Ellyse Perry scored a crucial 71 run knock against New Zealand in the recently concluded Women‚Äôs World Cup. (Source: Reuters)

Ahead of the crucial upcoming Ashes series the Australian women‚Äôs team suffered a big setback when skipper Meg Lanning was ruled due to a shoulder injury. However, this has led to Australian women‚Äôs team head coach Matthew Mott to point out that with Lanning ruled out for the Ashes, it provides an opportunity for other players to stand up and perform.

Speaking to cricket.com.au, Mott said, ‚ÄúAs an Australian team for the last few years, we‚Äôve been able to rely quite heavily on Meg. Not only does she score big runs, she scores them at a quick pace which puts pressure on opposition teams. So across the board I think that puts more onus on all players to find that spark and a little bit extra strike-rate that can make up for losing such a strong player We had Rachael Haynes on the sidelines for most of the World Cup, and in my opinion she‚Äôs a world-class player.

Commenting on the depth of the Aussie side, Mott said, ‚ÄúCertainly, the depth there in the batting can cover (Lanning), but when you take a great player out of any team it‚Äôs always hard to fill that void. Across the board, if everyone can find just a little bit extra ‚Äì and the beauty is there‚Äôs onus on everyone to do it ‚Äì the batting unit as a whole can grow from the experience of not having Meg there day in, and day out, to rely on.‚Äù

In the semi-finals of the Women‚Äôs World Cup Australia suffered a loss to India, which saw them out in the knockout stage. However, Mott doesn‚Äôt see that loss leading to many changes in the side.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm catching up with the selectors in the next few days. But that‚Äôs what happens in knock-out tournaments, we got to a semi-final and we felt like we were going quite well and then we were suddenly out.‚Äù, Mott said and added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like anyone had a chance to play themselves out of the team. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll look too far outside (the World Cup squad of 15), but the Ashes is across three formats so there will be some flexibility among the squads. ‚ÄúThere are a few players just outside pushing for selection, but there certainly won‚Äôt be massive changes.‚Äù

Jai Lava Kusa, Jr NTR‚Äôs next outing is an interesting try by the actor who will be donning three roles in the film. The teaser of his second role, Lava was released today and we have to say that it is poles apart from Jai‚Äôs look. While Jai is a devotee of Ravana, Lava Kumar speaks in a straightforward manner and has characteristics of Ram. He is a manager of a private bank, and his life is like anybody‚Äôs. Does it mean it is all about work, home, family and so on for him? Maybe not! Lava Kumar‚Äôs life takes a turn from briefcase, lunch boxes and files to something else, and this teaser probably features that one moment when his life changes.

Lava is driving home when he meets with an accident. So, what happens after? Well, only the filmmakers can tell us. After having seen the second look, we wonder how Lava and Jai will cross paths with each other and what kind of conflict does director KS Ravindra aka Bobby plans on springing on his audience?

We will have to wait and see, just like how we would patiently wait to know who Kusa is and what role he might be playing in the film. Will Kusa be the look that needed the help of prosthetics and so on?

The film is bankrolled by NTR Arts and the music for the film is composed by Devi Sri Prasad. Chota K. Naidu will be the man behind the lens and Nivetha Thomas along with Raashi Khanna will be playing the female leads in the film. So far, Nivetha Thomas‚Äô look has not been revealed.

We love how the designer added a touch of modern element to the look while retaining the feminine elegance with the ruffle work. It's kind of unusual to mix a corset top, shorts and a sheer dress together to create an outfit, but it's ace designer Ritu Kumar we are talking about. We thinks she pulled it off beautifully. The stylists did a brilliant job too by giving Patani lovely tousled hair and sun-kissed make-up. (Source: Express photo by Amit Chakravarty)

Babumoshai Bandookbaaz

Composer: Gaurav Dagaonkar, RD Burman

Lyrics: Ghalib Asad Bhopali

Singer Armaan Malik has always spoken about being inspired by singer Arijit Singh. But in Barfaani, a piece that comes after many years of doing playback (he debuted with Bhootnath in 2008), and can be easily called Malik‚Äôs finest musical outing till now, his tone, tenor, vibrato and the overall style lies somewhere in between Vishal Bhardwaj‚Äôs subtle baritone and Sonu Nigam‚Äôs nuanced voice. Malik sings this Gaurav Dagaonkar piece in the Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Bidita Bag starrer, and delivers the most dulcet bits in the album Babumoshai Bandookbaaz, even as most other pieces in the album are deft and nuanced.

Barfaani, a piece loosely based on Lalit, a soft morning raga ‚Äî mostly used in poignant compositions ‚Äî has been used as musical background for a few sensual scenes that drew the Censor Board‚Äôs displeasure sometime back. The piece opens with a short synth prelude and merges itself in it effortlessly. With very soft instrumentation and few deft strokes on the Spanish guitar as interludes, Malik‚Äôs voice dominates the beautifully layered composition. The piece also has a female version that introduces us to Orunima Bhattacharya. An interesting texture and classical training in place, Bhattacharya wades through it intelligently. However, it‚Äôs difficult to brush off the effect Malik‚Äôs version has on us.

Bhattacharya shines, however, in Aye saiyyaan ‚Äî a song that attempts to be UP folk. The piece opens with gabgubi twangs and harmonium chords and is from the world of bawdy, without the over imposing lyrics of that world. Towards the end, Vivek Naik joins in, in his extremely rustic, nautanki-style voice. It‚Äôs a lovely attempt at folk and Bhattacharya‚Äôs laughter towards the end of the piece hangs in the air post the conclusion. This is followed by Ghunghta, which has Neha Kakkar at the helm of it. A version of RD Burman‚Äôs piece sung by Kishore Kumar and Asha Bhosle in Dhongee, Kakkar sticks to her nasal voice to deliver a glossier version of the original. The big brass sounds in the background are the best part of the catchy piece ‚Äî a reminder of how age-old tracks are still able to give much freshness to the current soundtracks.

Chulbuli is fashioned like Kishore Kumar‚Äôs Ek ladki bheegi bhaagi si. We say fashioned because it‚Äôs a very different composition but touches the old one in a more structural way. It opens with an accordion merging into some horns and synth pieces. Papon‚Äôs baritone makes way soon and follows along basic jazz movements. It isn‚Äôt bad at all, but quite forgettable. Mohit Chauhan‚Äôs Khaali khaali follows soon. It‚Äôs is an interesting track and sung well by the singer. But it‚Äôs a composition that suffers from a problem spotted very often these days ‚Äî when the orchestration and the song aren‚Äôt synchronised enough in terms of scales used and directions taken. It‚Äôs a whimsical but forgettable track.

Ghalib Asad Bhopali‚Äôs lyrics avoid any banality or touch of truism, reminding us of his father Asad Bhopali‚Äôs immortal work. Overall, the album is a fine mix and Dagaonkar a crucial element in the upcoming musical arc of Bollywood.

‚ÄòClimbdown‚Äô for Britain over European Union court role after Brexit,"The influence of the ECJ in Britain was a major bone of contention in last year‚Äôs EU referendum campaign, in which supporters of a ‚ÄúLeave‚Äù vote had argued in favour of complete judicial sovereignty for Britain. The influence of the ECJ in Britain was a major bone of contention in last year‚Äôs EU referendum campaign, in which supporters of a ‚ÄúLeave‚Äù vote had argued in favour of complete judicial sovereignty for Britain.

The European Court of Justice could still wield influence in Britain even after Brexit through joint rulings with British officials, the government said today, in what critics called a ‚Äúclimbdown‚Äù. The proposals outlined also left open the possibility of the ECJ having jurisdiction during any transition periods agreed for after Britain leaves the bloc and before a new UK-EU partnership comes into force.

Opposition lawmakers said the negotiating position was a reversal from the complete break previously advocated by Prime Minister Theresa May, who had said she would ‚Äúbring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Britain.‚Äù The influence of the ECJ in Britain was a major bone of contention in last year‚Äôs EU referendum campaign, in which supporters of a ‚ÄúLeave‚Äù vote had argued in favour of complete judicial sovereignty for Britain.

The government paper published Wednesday said that only the ECJ‚Äôs ‚Äúdirect jurisdiction‚Äù would end. ‚ÄúIt is not necessary or appropriate for the CJEU (Court of Justice of the European Union) to have direct jurisdiction over a non-member state‚Ä¶ Such an arrangement would be unprecedented,‚Äù the Department for Exiting the EU said.

Britain said there were ‚Äúexisting ways of resolving disputes in international agreements, without the CJEU having direct jurisdiction‚Äù. It outlined several precedents such as joint political committees and arbitration courts already used by the EU to enforce international agreements with third countries, and said similar mechanisms could be used for Britain after Brexit.

Even the modified proposals are likely to prove a source of dispute with the EU, which has argued for direct ECJ jurisdiction for example in cases involving European citizens living in Britain. But the perception among government critics in Britain was of a softening of its position.

Pro-EU opposition Labour MP Chuka Umunna said the ‚Äúsudden shifting of the goalposts to ending only the ‚Äòdirect‚Äô jurisdiction of the ECJ suggests they are paving the way for some sort of climbdown‚Äù. Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, the most vocal pro-EU opposition party in parliament, said the proposals were a ‚Äúsensible and long overdue climbdown‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe government seems to have belatedly accepted it won‚Äôt be possible to end the EU court‚Äôs influence in the UK without damaging our free trade and security cooperation,‚Äù he said in a statement. Junior justice minister Dominic Raab defended the government‚Äôs position, saying it was ‚Äúabsolutely and wholesale wrong‚Äù to suggest that Britain would still have to respect the rulings of the ECJ.

But he added: ‚ÄúIt makes sense for the UK to keep half an eye on the case law of the EU and for the EU to keep half an eye on the case law of the UK,‚Äù he told BBC Radio. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament‚Äôs chief Brexit negotiator, criticised the UK‚Äôs latest proposal.

‚ÄúUK gov wants to keep ‚Äúhalf an eye‚Äù on ECJ ruling. EP (European Parliament) thinks ECJ must keep both eyes open to protect #citizenrights,‚Äù he wrote on Twitter. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve told the BBC: ‚ÄúThe idea that we are somehow going to wholly escape the influence of the European Court of Justice on our lives in this country is, I‚Äôm afraid, pie in the sky‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to continue in many areas to have a very profound influence, but of course the difference is going to be that we will no longer have any direct influence into the formation of that EU jurisprudence because we ourselves will no longer be appearing in front of the ECJ as an EU member,‚Äù he said.

Powerful typhoon kills at least 3 in Macau,"Thousands of people were evacuated from parts of the mainland coast ahead of the storm‚Äôs arrival, China‚Äôs official Xinhua News Agency reported. Thousands of people were evacuated from parts of the mainland coast ahead of the storm‚Äôs arrival, China‚Äôs official Xinhua News Agency reported.

A powerful typhoon caused at least three deaths Wednesday in Macau, according to local authorities in the Chinese gambling enclave.

Three men, aged 30, 45 and 62, were killed in falls and accidents related to the heavy rain and gusting winds from Typhoon Hato, and two other people were listed as missing, Macau‚Äôs Government Information Bureau said.

The typhoon came within 60 kilometers of the nearby financial center of Hong Kong before heading westward into mainland China, where it was gradually weakening.

China‚Äôs weather service said the storm made landfall around noon in the Pearl River Delta city of Zhuhai in the neighboring province of Guangdong.

Thousands of people were evacuated from parts of the mainland coast ahead of the storm‚Äôs arrival, China‚Äôs official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Train services were canceled, fishing boats returned to harbor and more than 4,000 fish farmers and their families came to shore, Xinhua said. Waves up to 10 meters high were expected in the South China Sea, the agency said.

Hato knocked out power in Macau, including at its famed casinos and a hospital, where backup generators kicked in. Flooding and injuries were reported in Hong Kong, which lies across the water 64 kilometers (40 miles) from Macau, but there were no reports of deaths.

In Hong Kong, Hato forced the closure of businesses, government offices, schools and the stock market, leaving the city‚Äôs normally bustling streets eerily quiet. Airlines canceled 450 flights and ferry operators halted commuter services and routes to Macau and cities in the delta.

Hato‚Äôs fierce gales brought down trees, overturned trash cans and blew out windows on skyscrapers, raining shattered glass onto the streets below.

Weather authorities in Hong Kong raised the No. 10 hurricane signal, the highest level, for the first time in five years.

By midday, Hato was packing maximum sustained winds of 126 kilometers per hour, with gusts of up to 207 kph on some outlying islands.

The No. 10 signal has only been hoisted 14 other times since 1946, or one for every 72 storms, according to the Hong Kong Observatory. The last time it went up was for Typhoon Vicente in 2012.

Change in mindset has made us believe we can win: Shakib Al Hasan,"Shakib Al Hasan has claimed that his side is high on confidence. (Source: AP) Shakib Al Hasan has claimed that his side is high on confidence. (Source: AP)

Ahead of the two-match Test series against Australia, Bangladesh allrounder Shakib Al Hasan has claimed that it is the change in mindset that has helped his side believe that they can win and become mentally stronger. While Australia will square-off against the Tigers at Dhaka for the first Test (their first Test in Bangladesh after a span of 11 years), Bangladesh seems upbeat about putting in a good performance.

In an interview with The Guardian Shakib said, ‚ÄúPreviously the mindset was to draw against big teams ‚Äì try to play five days, make a draw. But we never used to get the result. Then we started thinking, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs try to win ‚Äì let‚Äôs try to play and win the game‚Äô. It‚Äôs the mindset that changed, and that made us believe that we can win.‚Äù and added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long journey.It‚Äôs been incredible. I don‚Äôt think many people thought ‚Äì even in Bangladesh ‚Äì that we can come this far. We knew that we have this ability, and we needed that belief, and we can only get this belief by winning matches.‚Äù

Stating that there is a lot of confidence in the side, he further added, ‚ÄúBut there is no shortage of self-belief at this moment ‚Ä¶ Now we feel that we are very much unbeatable at home ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt matter who we are playing against. So this is the belief that makes a team a very good team, and a winning team.‚Äù

Earlier skipper Mushfiqur Rahim had also said that the Tigers can eat the mighty Australians at home.

Speaking to Cricbuzz, he said, ‚ÄúWe have always heard that Australia play aggressive cricket. We are ready to play against them with an aggressive mindset. ‚ÄúIf we can use the home conditions and play to our potential, I don‚Äôt think it is impossible to beat Australia. To be honest, if we can play our best cricket, we can beat any team in the world because we have that ability. ‚ÄúEarlier, we had to play well while others had to play badly if we wanted to achieve success but that is not the case now.‚Äù

OBC creamy layer limit increased from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh,"New Delhi: Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. (PTI Photo) New Delhi: Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. (PTI Photo)

IN A move that would increase the number of people getting the benefit of reservations in government jobs and educational institutions under the OBC quota, the Union government has revised the definition of ‚Äòcreamy layer‚Äô for OBCs, increasing the income cap from Rs 6 lakh per annum to Rs 8 lakh per annum.

The proposal, drafted by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, had been pending before the Cabinet for more than a year now. Sources said the proposal was formally cleared by a sub-committee under Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, which met on August 21. Briefing the media after the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Jaitley said, ‚ÄúThe Cabinet has been informed that the OBC creamy layer criteria, whose limit was Rs 6 lakh, has been increased to Rs 8 lakh.‚Äô‚Äô He said those earning beyond Rs 8 lakh per annum would now fall in the creamy layer classification and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had indicated at the move during his May 2017 address in Assam.

Earlier, the 27 per cent OBC reservation in central civil posts and services and central government educational institutions, could be availed of by those earning an annual family income of up to Rs 6 lakh. This is in keeping with the Supreme Court directive in the Indira Sawhney vs Union of India case where it said that the creamy layer of the OBC should not avail reservation facilities.

"After Barcelona departure, Neymar reunites with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez; see pics","Neymar with Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi. (Source: Instagram) Neymar with Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi. (Source: Instagram)

The MSN trio proved to the world that they hold no grudges against each other as they attend Neymar‚Äôs son‚Äôs birthday party on Tuesday despite the Brazilian record transfer to French club Paris Saint Germain and the drama that has unfolded since then between his former club Barcelona and the current club.

Barcelona said in a statement on Tuesday that they are suing the 25-year old for 8.5 million euros ($10.00 million) for breach of contract. But that did not stop the Catalan players Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Gerard Pique from turning up at Neymar‚Äôs son‚Äôs birthday party and displaying social media love for each other from their official accounts.

While Rakitic put up a picture on Instagram of the famous trio with the caption ‚ÄòGreat Afternoon‚Äô, Neymar and Messi poked fun at Pique, who had earlier said that Neymar will stay with the Spanish club.

Neymar is clearly missing the bond he shared with his Catalan teammates as he captioned his picture, ‚ÄòFriends I missed‚Äô. On Wednesday, he gave a statement through his lawyers that he will contest legal action initiated by his former club Barcelona.

The striker had expressed his disappointement with Barca directors on Sunday, saying, ‚ÄúI am disappointed with them (Barcelona directors). I spent four very happy years there and left happy, but not with them. For me they shouldn‚Äôt be in charge of Barcelona. Barca deserve much better and everyone knows this.‚Äù

LeT among 64 groups barred from collecting hides on Eid in Pakistan,"Pakistan has prohibited the collection of hides of sacrificial animals by 64 groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), during the Eid festival to prevent fund-raising by any banned outfit in the country. The Ministry of Interior said that any group collecting hides should get the ‚ÄòNo Objection Certificate‚Äô by the chief civil administrator of each district where the group was planning to collect hides.

Those banned included 64 outfits including Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan, Balochistan National Liberation Army and others. Warning of consequences for those illegally collecting skins of animals, the ministry said that the culprits would be prosecuted under the Anti-Terrorism Act.

The action is being taken under the National Action Plan which prevents fund collection by any banned outfit in Pakistan. Eid al-Azha festival would be observed in Pakistan on September 2 and Muslims offer sacrifice of animals on the occasion.

Since sacrifice is mandatory for each Muslim who can afford, millions of Pakistanis offer sacrifice. Traditionally, the hides are given to charitable institutions, orphanages and seminaries. Militant groups have exploited this to generate fund for terrorism.

China comes to Pak‚Äôs rescue after Trump exerts pressure to dismantle terror safe havens: Top developments,"Pakistan‚Äôs Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is yet to respond to Donald Trump‚Äôs remarks.

Trump had come down heavily on Pakistan for its support to terrorist groups, saying it receives billions of dollars in US aid but continues to shelter terrorists. AP/PTI

Days after US President Donald Trump chastised Pakistan for providing safe haven to terror groups on its soil, Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, along with powerful Pakistani generals, is formulating a suitable response to the new US policy on Afghanistan, which includes putting greater pressure on Islamabad to do more to rein in militants. Some US lawmakers have rallied behind Trump‚Äôs call for stiffer action against Pakistan, including stringent measures like losing the major non-NATO ally status to the nuclear-powered country, cut in military aid among others. Donald Trump had come down heavily on Pakistan for its support to terrorist groups, saying it receives billions of dollars in US aid but continues to shelter terrorists.

Although Abbasi hasn‚Äôt yet responded to Trump‚Äôs statement, Pakistan‚Äôs Foreign Minister Khwaja Asif has told Washington that it should not use the country as a ‚Äòscapegoat‚Äô for America‚Äôs failure in Afghanistan‚Äôs 16-year-long war. Pakistan has categorically denied harbouring militants.

US must respect Pak‚Äôs sovereignty, security concerns: China

Amid all the flak from Washington, Pakistan‚Äôs close ally, China, came to its rescue on Thursday saying US should recognise Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äòimportant role‚Äô in Afghanistan and respect its security concerns. China‚Äôs State Councillor Yang Jiechi defended Pakistan‚Äôs role in Afghanistan in a telephone discussion with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. ‚ÄúWe should attach importance to Pakistan‚Äôs important role in Afghanistan and respect Pakistan‚Äôs sovereignty and legitimate security concerns,‚Äù Yang said.

Adding to Yang‚Äôs remarks expressing full backing for Pakistan, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the media that China ‚Äúvalued Pakistan‚Äôs role in Afghanistan issue and respect Pakistan‚Äôs sovereign and reasonable security concerns‚Äù. ‚Äú(On the) President Trump‚Äôs remarks on Pakistan, I should say that Pakistan is in the frontline of fighting terrorism, made sacrifices to fighting terrorism, making important contribution to upholding peace and stability,‚Äù Hua had said on Tuesday.

Hua also highlighted the importance of China-Pakistan friendship saying the two countries are all-weather friends and partners. ‚ÄúWe have always given to each other support to our core issues and interests,‚Äù she said. Citing the ambitious China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Hua lauded Pakistan‚Äôs support to the USD 50 billion project. India has protested on various forums against the CPEC. ‚ÄúAgainst the current backdrop, we appreciate Pakistani efforts in ensuring security as well as anti-terrorism cooperation in the CPEC,‚Äù she said.

Will ask nations that harbour terrorists to eliminate them: US

In an apparent message to Pakistan, a top Trump administration official said today that US will ask nations that harbour terror networks to eliminate them and will target terrorists in their sanctuaries. ‚ÄúWe will demand that nations ultimately provide for their own security. Those that harbour terrorist networks must eliminate them,‚Äù Lt Gen (Retd) Keith Kellogg, Executive Secretary and Chief of Staff of the National Security Council, wrote in an op-ed to Breitbart News.

Although the op-ed did not mention any country, Kellogg‚Äôs reference seemed obviously directed at Pakistan.

US lawmakers welcome Trump‚Äôs strategy to exert pressure on Pakistan

An influential group of US lawmakers have welcomed US President Donald Trump‚Äôs new South Asia strategy which holds Pakistan accountable for its actions and continued presence of terrorist safe havens. ‚ÄúWe appreciate the President‚Äôs renewed pressure on Pakistan to cooperate in the fight against terrorists, and hold Pakistan to account for supporting extremists. The President made it clear that we are not into nation building, but focused on protecting our citizens from terrorism,‚Äù

How will Ram Rahim arrive? Cops on ground still don‚Äôt know,"Gurmeet Ram Rahim Gurmeet Ram Rahim

How will the Dera Sacha Sauda chief, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, arrive in Panchkula to go to court when it pronounces the verdict in the rape case against him on August 25? Will he come by road from the Sirsa heaquarters of the Dera Sacha Sauda or land somewhere in Panchkula or adjoining Chandigarh by chopper?

The question seems to be giving Haryana officials sleepless nights since August 17 when the special CBI court in Panchkula reserved the decision and decided to pronounce the verdict on August 25 in the presence of suspect Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who is protected with Z plus security cover, provided by the government, because it is believed that he is a target for Sikh extremist groups.

Sources attached to security arrangements in Panchkula said, ‚ÄúThe entire police top brass is busy chalking out a specific plan and officers are in constant touch with the Dera management, suggesting it to adopt the safest mode of travel from Sirsa to Panchkula. It will be a tough time for the police to handle the situation at a time when over one lakh followers of the Dera head are expected to be present in Panchkula on August 25.‚Äù

A senior Haryana police officer, deputed in Panchkula, said, ‚ÄúHis arrival plan is top secret. Only a couple of officers are in the loop on this. How the Dera head will enter the district court complex and how he will be escorted out is also not clear. Recently, Haryana DGP B S Sandhu, along with senior officers, was in Sirsa and the topic was discussed there. But, the outcome is yet to be shared with us.‚Äù

In February 2008, the Dera chief‚Äôs cavalcade was targeted when a tyre filled with explosives was hurled at his car, triggering a blast that injured 11 people near Nilokheri in Karnal district. The Dera chief was unhurt in the attack.

Later, three persons, including Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) leader Bakhshish Singh, alias Baba, was held guilty for attempting to kill the Dera head in September 2012. In March 2017, a letter of threat, addressed to Gurmeet Ram Rahim, was received by the Dera management in Sirsa.

Matteo Trentin beat Spaniard Juan Jose Lobato in a final straight sprint to win stage four of the Vuelta A Espana on Tuesday when Chris Froome retained the overall lead.

Italian Quick-Step Floor rider Trentin completed a hat-trick of stage wins in grand tours, adding victory in the Vuelta to the Tour de France and the Giro d‚ÄôItalia.

He rode the 198.2km route from Andorra‚Äôs Escaldes-Engordany to Tarragona, Catalonia in 4:43:57.

‚ÄúI was really looking for this stage win because I‚Äôm really going well in this last part of the season,‚Äù Trentin told reporters.

‚ÄúAfter my crash that spoiled my time in the Tour de France, I was just thinking about coming here and winning stages.‚Äù

This was Quick-Step‚Äôs second stage win of the Vuelta after Yves Lampaert took stage two.

Belgium‚Äôs Tom Van Asbroeck of Cannondale-Drapac came third.

Team Sky‚Äôs Froome stays in the red jersey after finishing in the bunch, leading David de la Cruz, Nicolas Roche and Tejay van Garderen by two seconds, with an overall time of 13:37:41.

The Briton is attempting to become the first rider to do a Tour de France and Vuelta double since Bernard Hinault in 1978, when the Spanish race took place earlier in the year instead of in gruelling August heat.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great feeling to be back in red after six years,‚Äù said Froome. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge privilege to be in this position. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get to tomorrow, tomorrow. I‚Äôm taking it one day at a time and just enjoying being in the red jersey.‚Äù

"US Judge shot, wounded near Ohio courthouse; gunman killed","A judge walking from his car into the county courthouse was shot by a gunman but managed to fire back before a probation officer stepped in and ultimately killed the suspect, authorities said. Jefferson County Judge Joseph Bruzzese Jr. was shot today at around 8 am near the courthouse in Steubenville, just across the Ohio River from West Virginia‚Äôs northern panhandle, roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Pittsburgh. Courthouse video shows both the judge and the gunman firing about five times each, said Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla.

‚ÄúWhoever thought this could happen here?‚Äù Abdalla said, adding that investigators are familiar with the suspect and are checking to see if he had any connection with the judge. Steubenville City Manager James Mavromatis tells WTOV-TV that Bruzzese was talking after being wounded. He was flown to a Pittsburgh-area hospital.

Investigators didn‚Äôt immediately release further information about the judge‚Äôs condition or on the suspect. Republican Gov. John Kasich said he was told the judge would survive.

The attack had to be intentional because people know about the reserved spots where judges park, said one of Bruzzese‚Äôs judicial colleagues.

Judge Joseph Corabi said he and the county‚Äôs two other judges park in reserved spots next to the courthouse in eastern Ohio. Judges then walk a few feet down what‚Äôs known as ‚ÄúCourthouse Alley‚Äù to a side entrance to the building, said Corabi, the Jefferson County juvenile and probate court judge.

‚ÄúEverybody knows who parks there. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not an accident what happened. He was clearly an intended target,‚Äù Corabi said.

Corabi said Bruzzese is known as an avid hunter. He called him fair, hard-working, well-liked and ‚Äúa tough son of a gun.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is very intelligent and he can cut to the chase,‚Äù Corabi said. ‚ÄúHe spots issues and he resolves the issues.‚Äù Bruzzese, 65, hears general and domestic relations cases as one of two judges serving in Jefferson County Common Pleas Court.

Bruzzese has served on that court since 1997, according to Ohio Supreme Court records. He was most recently re-elected in 2014 for another six-year term.

Bruzzese had likely arrived early to review his usual Monday morning batch of legal motions, Corabi said.

Local media reported that the suspect‚Äôs body could be seen lying next to a car at the drive-thru of a neighboring bank. Police said a man who was in the car with him was taken into custody.

The courthouse was closed for the day as local and state authorities helped secure the scene. Jefferson County Commissioner Thomas Graham told WTOV that some courthouse workers witnessed the ‚Äútragic situation‚Äù and that people would need time to process what had happened.

The state crime lab will help investigate the shooting, said Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine.

The chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court called the attack a ‚Äúcowardly ambush‚Äù and urged court personnel √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù especially judges √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù to take extra precautions.

The attack ‚Äúreminds us all of the very real potential for violence against judges,‚Äù Maureen O‚ÄôConnor said. ‚ÄúViolence against judges represents an attack on the Rule of Law, the foundation of our country.‚Äù

"Judwaa 2 trailer launch: Varun Dhawan, Taapsee Pannu, Jacqueline Fernandez burn the stage on the tunes of ‚ÄòTan Tana Tan‚Äô","The trailer of Judwaa 2, one of the most awaited remakes in Bollywood was released at a big bash in Mumbai today and going by the pictures, it looks like the team including Varun Dhawan, Taapsee Pannu and Jacqueline Fernandez had a blast with their fans. Helmed by David Dhawan, Judwaa 2 is a rehash version of the Salman Khan and Karisma Kapoor-starrer Judwaa which released in 1997.

The actors sportingly crooned to the tunes of ""Tan Tana Tan"" at the launch, much to the astonishment of their fans. Apart from ""Tan Tana Tan"", Judwaa 2 will also reprise the famous Anu Malik number ""Oonchi Hai Building"" in the remake.

While Salman Khan's Judwaa has found a place of its own in Bollywood, we need to see what Judwaa 2 has in store for fans. Salman Khan, who played the lead in the original flick, is also going to make a cameo appearance in this one.

The Judwaa 2 team apparently brought their own twist to the event and arrived with 50 pairs of real twins for the launch.

Looks like, the actors also shook a leg on the upcoming songs from the film. While Judwaa 2 features Varun in a double role - geeky Prem and badass Raja, Jacqueline and Taapsee are all set to step into the shoes of Karisma Kapoor and Rambha."

AP/PTI Photo(AP8_22_2017_000171B)

A small but deadly earthquake on the Italian holiday island of Ischia exposed a deep political fault line on Tuesday over the country‚Äôs proliferation of unsafe, illegal housing. The tremor, officially recorded in Italy at a modest strength of 4.0, toppled buildings, killed two people and injured dozens in a district where seven years ago residents rioted to prevent bulldozers from razing illegally built homes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ridiculous that people should die in an earthquake of this strength,‚Äù said Francesco Peduto, president of Italy‚Äôs national association of geologists. ‚ÄúIn other advanced countries a quake like this would do no damage at all.‚Äù A fifth of new Italian houses were built illegally in 2015, according to the statistics bureau ISTAT, up from 9 percent in 2008. In four southern regions ‚Äì including Sicily and Campania, where Ischia lies ‚Äì the proportion stood at well over a third two years ago.

The legal status of the buildings that came down on Monday night was unclear. But the deaths reopened a debate over the problem of builders sidestepping regulations, including those designed to ensure homes can resist earthquakes. ‚ÄúIschia has always been a symbol of illegal building, random cementification and impunity,‚Äù Italy‚Äôs environmentalist lobby Legambiente said in a statement after the earthquake. It struck three days before the first anniversary of a much bigger, 6.2 magnitude quake that killed nearly 300 people in central Italy, most of them in the town of Amatrice.

The government and political parties say they want to tackle the problem, but they have been reluctant to match words with deeds, especially in the run-up to local elections in Sicily in November and a national vote early next year. Many houses, especially in the poor south, have been built illegally to save money and time by avoiding taxes and red tape, and their owners resist attempts to enforce the law.

Angelo Cambiano, former mayor of the small Sicilian town of Licata, paid a high price for tackling the problem. He first received anonymous threats and was finally forced from office by his own councillors this month after demolishing 67 illegal dwellings, mostly holiday homes on the coast, since he took office in 2015. Cambiano‚Äôs approach was unusual. Governments of all political stripes have preferred to serve up regular amnesties for illegal construction work, allowing culprits to regularise their position with the payment of a modest fine while allowing the structures to stand.

The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, favourite to win Sicily‚Äôs regional election, came under fire this month when its candidate argued that inadequate housing policies had obliged many Sicilians to build illegally. His words were widely seen as justification for illegal and shoddy construction. Five-Star, whose battle cries are legality and sustainable development, was attacked for burying its principles in a bid for power. Its most prominent member of parliament, Luigi Di Maio, clarified that ‚Äúall houses served with a demolition order have to come down‚Äù.

TRAGIC PRECEDENT

Ischia, off the southern port city of Naples, is no stranger to earthquakes. A larger tremor in 1883 killed more than 2,000 people on the island. Yet little has been done to make its houses safer now than they were then.

Seven years ago hundreds of its residents built barricades and threw bottles to stop bulldozers reaching the first of 600 illegally built houses due to be demolished. Almost all the houses were spared and the clashes took place in the part of the island worst hit by Monday‚Äôs quake. The island has just 64,000 inhabitants but they have presented 27,000 requests to take advantage of amnesties for illegal building over the last 30 years. Despite lobbying by environmentalists and lip service from politicians, illegal house building in Italy has continued apace even as the construction industry as a whole has been hard hit by a triple-dip recession since 2008.

It can cut the cost of a new house by more than half, according to Legambiente, thanks to savings on materials and manpower as well as on the costs of permits and taxes. But in a country often hit by floods and landslides as well as earthquakes, it can also be shortsighted. ‚ÄúWe have cried too many times for people buried under the rubble of houses built illegally,‚Äù said Infrastructure Minister Graziano Delrio. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to say enough is enough.‚Äù

"In Suresh Prabhu‚Äôs 3 years, 249 deaths from 207 train derailments","Railways Ministrer Suresh Prabhu (Express Photo by Renuka Puri) Railways Ministrer Suresh Prabhu (Express Photo by Renuka Puri)

RAILWAYS MINISTER Suresh Prabhu‚Äôs tenure has seen the maximum number of passenger deaths due to derailment of trains in a decade, according to official statistics. Data available for the last 10 years show 193 passengers died in derailments in 2016-17 ‚Äî the highest in a year since 2006-07. The 2015-16 figures taken with this year‚Äôs fatalities from train derailments, including Saturday‚Äôs derailment of Utkal Express in Khatauli near Muzaffarnagar, takes the number of passengers killed in derailments to 249. Prabhu assumed office in November 2014.

In comparison, 84 people died in 157 derailments in the last three years of the UPA government, as many as 73 of those deaths recorded in 2011-12 alone. The magnitude of derailments in the past three years can be gauged from the total number of passengers impacted in those accidents. Figures say derailments in the past three years have killed and injured 1,135 passengers in 207 such mishaps.

While incidents of derailment each year have been on a downward spiral since 100 such accidents were recorded in 2007-08, the last three years have shown an upward trend: from 63 in 2014-15 (Prabhu‚Äôs first year in office) to 78 in 2016-17.

Under fire for the latest derailment in Khatauli that killed 20 and injured 92 on Saturday, Suresh Prabhu‚Äôs office on Monday released figures to buttress the point that during his tenure, train travel has become safer going by the numbers. However, the 800-word note does not mention train derailments, and the consequent deaths, during Prabhu‚Äôs tenure. The note does not in fact mention the word ‚Äúderailment‚Äù, even though the biggest passenger casualty figures in train mishaps under the Narendra Modi government since May 2014 have been due to derailments.

According to the official note, the number of accidents decreased in the last three years ‚Äî from 135 in 2014-15 to 107 in 2016-17 ‚Äî but that did not lead to a drastic fall in fatality figures, which show 685 passengers died in 346 accidents. In the three years preceding that, 675 passengers died in 371 accidents, indicating that fewer accidents caused more or less similar degrees of casualties in the three years under Prabhu.

The note from the ministry and Prabhu‚Äôs office says: ‚ÄúInvestments for safety have increased from Rs 33,972 crore per year during the UPA-II to Rs 54,031 crore every year under this government, a jump of 60 per cent. The average vacancy in safety positions during the period 2009-10 to 2013-14 was 18.65 per cent of the total sanctioned strength. This has dropped to 16.86 per cent in 2017 despite the sanctioned strength increasing by 5 per cent from 2014 to 2017.‚Äù

Chairman of Punjab State Gau Sewa Commission Keemti Bhagat on Wednesday said that the Commission would soon summon officials of the state government for their laxity towards dealing with the problem of stray cattle in Punjab.

Presiding over a meeting with the officers of the district administration to review the issue of stray cattle in the state, the Chairman said that it was unfortunate that some officials were showing callousness towards this noble cause. He said that the Commission was a statutory body that has been vested with the powers to summon the erring officials.

Bhagat added that the Commission was duty-bound to ensure the well being of cattle in the state and every effort would be made to discharge this duty.

The chairman also asked the municipal authorities to make efforts for dealing with stray cattle menace, besides ensuring optimum utilisation of the funds collected by the civic body through the levying of cow cess on nine items.

Pakistan back in Hockey World Cup despite seventh place finish,"Pakistan become the 13th team to qualify for the global showpiece. (Source: File) Pakistan become the 13th team to qualify for the global showpiece. (Source: File)

A seventh-place finish at the Hockey World League Semi-Finals has proved good enough for Pakistan to qualify for next year‚Äôs men‚Äôs Hockey World Cup in India, marking their return to the mega-event after missing out on the previous edition.

The European semi-finalists have already qualified for the mega-event, which will be held in Bhubaneswar from November 28 to December 16, helping Pakistan‚Äôs cause.

The Green Shirts, currently ranked 14th in the FIH standings, ended seventh in the World League Semi-Finals in London, where the likes of Germany, England, Netherlands and Belgium earned World Cup qualification by finishing in the top five.

The results at the Rabobank EuroHockey Championships, which are currently taking place in Amsterdam, have gone very much in favour of Pakistan, with all four of the semi-finalists having already qualified for the World Cup via the HWL route.

Under FIH regulations, the team that wins its continental qualifier automatically qualifies for the World Cup. Pakistan are the higher ranked of the two seventh place finishers from the HWL Semi-Final events that took place in London and Johannesburg, with 16th ranked France next in line for that all-important World Cup ticket.

Pakistan become the 13th team to qualify for the global showpiece, joining host nation India, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, England, Germany, Ireland, Malaysia, Netherlands, Spain and New Zealand.

They have an envious record in the competition, having claimed the title on four occasions, which is more than any other nation.

Too much of good cholesterol bad for your health: Study,"The levels of both good and bad cholesterol should be maintained instead of them being higher or lower. (Source: File Photo) The levels of both good and bad cholesterol should be maintained instead of them being higher or lower. (Source: File Photo)

While high levels of good cholesterol have long known to be beneficial, its excess can also raise your risk of death, researchers claim. Cholesterol is a fatty substance known as a lipid and is vital for the normal functioning of the body. However, the findings showed that people with extremely high levels of good cholesterol have a higher mortality rate than people with normal levels.

For men with extremely high levels, the mortality rate was 106 per cent higher than the normal group, while for women it was found to be 68 per cent higher.

‚ÄúThese results radically change the way we understand ‚Äògood‚Äô cholesterol. Doctors have been used to congratulating patients who had a very high level of HDL in their blood. But we should no longer do so, as this study shows a dramatically higher mortality rate,‚Äù said Borge Nordestgaard, Professor at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

For the study, the team analysed data of 116,000 people. They were followed for an average of six years and the result showed over 10,500 deaths. On the other hand, people with extremely low levels of HDL in the blood were also at increased risk of mortality, the researchers said.

The people with medium levels of HDL in the blood had the lowest mortality. For men, this level was 1.9 mmol/L. For women, it was 2.4 mmol/L. ‚ÄúIt appears that we need to remove the focus from HDL as an important health indicator in research at hospitals and at the general practitioner,‚Äù Nordestgaard said.

"Vahid Halilhodzic future not discussed, says Japan FA","The Japan Football Association have said they will not discuss speculation over the future of national team coach Vahid Halilhodzic, after reports said he will be replaced if the team lose their pivotal World Cup qualifying match against Australia this month.

Reports in the Japanese media on Wednesday claimed the Bosnian, who led Algeria to the Round of 16 at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, would be sacked if Japan are defeated by the Asian champions at Saitama Stadium on August 31.

A victory would mean that Japan, who lead Group B in Asia‚Äôs qualifying tournament, would seal their place at the World Cup finals in Russia.

However, defeat against Australia and Saudi Arabia, who they meet on September 5, would leave the team facing a series of playoffs to progress.

‚ÄúAll the talk right now is positive,‚Äù JFA technical director Akira Nishino was reported as saying by Kyodo News.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt discuss speculations or ifs and buts, and the issue was not raised today. We just want to get it done at home against Australia and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù

Japan were held to a 1-1 draw by Iraq in their previous qualifying match in June. But Nishino insisted that the association was fully supportive of the team‚Äôs efforts.

‚ÄúWe ‚Äì from the president to me to the technical committee ‚Äì have always maintained that we will be fully behind this team during the World Cup qualifying, and that hasn‚Äôt changed,‚Äù he said.

Japan, who are aiming to qualify for a sixth straight World Cup after making their debut in France in 1998, have not beaten the Socceroos in qualifying for the tournament since Australia joined the Asian Football Confederation in 2006.

"PMC committee approves Rs 6,646-crore Ring Road project","THE CITY Improvement Committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) approved on Wednesday the civic adminsitration‚Äôs Rs 6,646-crore plan for development of the proposed High Capacity Mass Transit Route (HCMTR).

Also known as Internal Ring Road for the city, it will be a 36-km elevated route.

The Ring Road is expected to decongest the city roads and provide better connectivity to various parts of the city.

‚ÄúThe civic administration‚Äôs proposal for the Ring Road has been approved and directions have been issued to raise funds for implementation of the project,‚Äù said Mahesh Ladkat, chairperson, City Improvement Committee.

He added that the entire route would be elevated and civic administration has been asked to make plans for its faster implementation.

‚ÄúDevelopment of the proposed Ring Road has been pending for over 20 years. It (the route) is needed to decongest the city roads,‚Äù said Ladkat, adding that he would also discuss the proposal with Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.

As per civic administration‚Äôs plan, the estimated cost of the project is Rs 5,096 crore for development of the road and Rs 1,550 crore for land acquisition. It is expected to be constructed within three years, once the land is acquired and required funds are raised.

The development of Ring Road would require acquisition of land of forest department, railways, irrigation department and defence ministry. The road would be 35.96-km-long and 24-metre-wide. It would be a six-lane road with two dedicated lanes for BRTS and four lanes for private vehicles.

The provision for the Ring Road was part of the development plan prepared in 1987 and its alignment was changed wherever required. The road would pass through Bopodi, Pune University Junction, Senapati Bapat Road, Paud Phata, Karve Road, Dattawadi, Sarasbaug, Nehru Road, Lullanagar, Wanowrie, Ramwadi, Mundwa, Vadgaonsheri, Vimanagar Junction and Vishrantwadi.

The project would also include development of existing roads, which would be part of the Ring Road. There would be a total of 28 bus stops for BRTS on the route and the speed limit would be of 50 km per hour.

"Southampton and Newcastle go out in League Cup, Burnley wins derby","Burnley beat Blackburn Rovers 2-0 at Ewood Park on Wednesday. (Source: Reuters) Burnley beat Blackburn Rovers 2-0 at Ewood Park on Wednesday. (Source: Reuters)

Burnley beat Blackburn Rovers 2-0 at Ewood Park in their East Lancashire derby but Premier League sides Southampton and Newcastle United crashed out of the English League Cup to Championship opposition in Wednesday‚Äôs second-round games.

Southampton lost 2-0 at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers with Danny Batth and Donovan Wilson on target for Wolves, who won the League Cup in 1974 and 1980.

Newcastle, after two straight losses in the Premier League, were pushed into extra time by Nottingham Forest with the tie ending 2-2 after normal time, Jason Cummings scoring twice for the visitors.

Seven minutes into extra time Tyler Wilson headed in the winner for Forest, four-time winners of the competition, to add to the woes of Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez.

First-half goals from Jack Cork and Robbie Brady gave Burnley a two-goal advantage at the break and the Clarets comfortably saw out the game.

The match between the two old rivals was marred by a Blackburn fan invading the pitch and physically confronting the Burnley players, grabbing the neck of midfielder Ashley Westwood before he was removed by stewards.

Premier League West Ham enjoyed a 2-0 win at League Two Cheltenham Town while Joe Allen scored twice for Stoke City in their 4-0 win over League One Rochdale.

Huddersfield Town have enjoyed life in the Premier League so far with two straight wins and they continued their positive form, coming back from a goal down to win 2-1 at home to Rotherham.

Thai lawyer drops defamation suit against BBC reporter,"The lawyer who brought the suit, Pratuan Thanarak, decided to drop the charges against BBC reporter Jonathan Head on the first day of the trial on Wednesday. (File) The lawyer who brought the suit, Pratuan Thanarak, decided to drop the charges against BBC reporter Jonathan Head on the first day of the trial on Wednesday. (File)

A Thai lawyer has dropped his criminal defamation suit against a BBC correspondent following his investigation into foreigners being scammed of their retirement homes in the country, the broadcaster said on Thursday. Jonathan Head, the BBC‚Äôs Southeast Asia correspondent, faced up to five years in jail after his report exposed how two foreign retirees had Phuket properties stolen from them by a network of criminals and corrupt officials.

Rights groups said the case highlighted how Thailand‚Äôs broad defamation and computer crime laws scupper investigative journalism and make it difficult to uncover wrongdoing in an endemically corrupt country.

The lawyer who brought the suit ‚Äî Pratuan Thanarak ‚Äìdecided to drop the charges against Head on the first day of the trial on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe plaintiff has withdrawn his case against BBC journalist Jonathan Head, but as the trial of his co-defendant is continuing, we cannot comment further at present,‚Äù the BBC said in a short statement.

Foreigners cannot own land in Thailand but they often get around it by putting assets in the name of Thais, or by setting up majority Thai-owned shell companies. The 2015 BBC report detailed how a network of Phuket criminals, aided by corrupt officials, stole properties from foreigners by forging land title transfers.

One of the victims who featured in the report, British national Ian Rance, is a joint defendant in the prosecution. He still faces a single defamation charge and up to two years in jail if convicted.

Rance said he lost $1.2 million worth of properties after his then wife and a gang of money-lenders forged property paperwork. According to the report, Pratuan admitted on tape to certifying Rance‚Äôs signature without him being present, a move which helped the wife transfer his properties out of his name.

She was later convicted and jailed for the scam, but Rance has been hit by a slew of legal cases since going public, a common outcome faced by whistleblowers in Thailand which markets itself as an ideal retirement destination for wealthy foreigners.

The criminal complaint filed by Pratuan, which AFP has seen, alleges Rance ‚Äúdefamed‚Äù him by talking to the BBC sometime in September 2015 but there are no details of what was said or how it was defamatory.

AFP understands the BBC will continue to fund Rance‚Äôs defamation defence. Pratuan and Rance both declined to comment when contacted by AFP on Thursday, citing ongoing proceedings.

Unlike most countries where defamation is a civil crime, in Thailand it is a criminal offence. Private citizens can also launch their own prosecutions and they are not forced to pay costs if they lose.

Similar cases have been brought in recent years. Local news site Phuketwan closed down in 2015 after running out of money in its successful bid to defeat a suit brought by Thailand‚Äôs navy.

Andrew Drummond, a British crime reporter, left the country the same year because of multiple cases brought by those he exposed, as did British labour rights activist Andy Hall in 2016.

Text message alerts prove life saver in flood-hit Nepal,"An ariel view of flooded land is seen at Dhanusha District, Nepal, Sunday, Aug. 13, 2017. Landslides and flooding triggered by heavy rain have killed dozens of people in southern Nepal and left thousands homeless, police said Sunday.

Landslides and flooding triggered by heavy rain have killed dozens of people in southern Nepal and left thousands homeless, police said Sunday. (AP Photo/Niranjan Shrestha)

It was a simple text message that saved Shreejana Pariyar from being washed to oblivion along with all her worldly goods when flash floods devastated western Nepal last week. A day after the Babai river flooded her home in Taduwa village ‚Äì carrying off everything but the beds and leaving a muddy mess in its wake ‚Äì Pariyar delivered a baby son. ‚ÄúI feel luck to be alive,‚Äù she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, cradling her newborn on the porch of her home.

‚ÄúThe water swept away food, clothes, kitchen utensils and everything I kept inside, apart from the beds,‚Äù she added. Local charities say hundreds of lives were saved, possibly thousands, thanks to the mass government text alerts, which enabled people to flee before the worst rains hit. Dinanath Bhandari, a programme coordinator at Practical Action, said the alerts had led to the evacuation of more than 4,700 people from their homes in the Babai river basin.

MASS EVACUATION

With her husband away on a seasonal job in Saudi Arabia, Pariyar‚Äôs neighbours took her to a nearby school just hours before the flood reached her home, having received a text message alerting them to the impending disaster. ‚ÄúThe Babai flood water level is constantly rising above the danger level ‚Äì so please leave the area and find another safe place nearby,‚Äù read the text from the Nepalese government.

Heavy monsoon rains in Nepal have killed at least 141 people since they hit on August 12, according to the government, with many still reported missing. With flood waters receding, aid workers voice rising concerns about food shortages and water-borne diseases. Twenty seven of the country‚Äôs 75 districts ‚Äì including Bardiya district, where Taduwa is located ‚Äì were either submerged or hit by landslides, leaving villages and communities stranded without food, water and electricity. It could all have been much worse.

More than 4,000 people were evacuated after a series of text alerts were sent by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology to 50,000 people living in the flood-prone Babai river area, said Practical Action, a charity working in the area. Mangal Budha Chhetri, a local community leader who coordinated early warning efforts in Taduwa, said the text alerts saved 450 lives in his village alone. Bir Bahadur Chand, a hydrologist working at the department, explained that ‚Äúa water gauge station set up in Chepang, a nearby village, reads water levels and sends real-time data to the department‚Äôs flood forecasting team, who use it as a basis for issuing alerts.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen the Babai riverbank started to overflow on August 12, we assessed that the water would take about three hours to reach Taduwa from Chepang, so we sent text alerts to 50,000 users living in the area,‚Äù he added. The messages were sent through telecom operators Nepal Telecom and Ncell, both of which had agreed to lend their messaging service to flood-hit areas for free, Chand explained.

NEAR MISS

When Pariyar went home after the flood, the ground floor of her house was covered with mud and ‚Äúcompletely uninhabitable‚Äù.

‚ÄúSo I spend day and night on my front porch while I use the money my husband sends to hire workers to renovate the house,‚Äù she said. Chhetri said that Taduwa village was ‚Äúmuddy everywhere‚Äù.

‚ÄúMaize and paddy fields around the area were badly damaged and the flood swept away everything people had kept inside.‚Äù Sumitra Budhathoki, a mother of three from Taduwa who also received the alerts, said her family initially hesitated to leave ‚Äúbecause the flood did not seem so bad in the beginning‚Äù.

‚ÄúBut after 24 hours, the flood swamped all of the houses in the village,‚Äù she added.

‚ÄúSo if we had stayed, we all would have died.‚Äù

WHERE‚ÄôS THE RESILIENCE?

Chand said that although ‚Äúfloods still regularly wreak havoc across the country, we have become much better at informing communities ‚Äì through text alerts or flood sirens ‚Äì about weather shocks and convincing them to evacuate their homes.‚Äù While the government has been issuing text alerts ahead of floods since 2015, more people are now taking action and leaving their homes, thanks to local efforts to raise awareness of potential disasters, he added.

However, Bhandari from Practical Action says the government needs to work more with local authorities and NGOs to help people become more resilient to such disasters in the long run. ‚ÄúOver the past years, thousands of people have died due to floods or landslides but they could have been saved if there were better coordination and timely communication between local and national authorities,‚Äù he said.

For now, families such as Putali Sunar‚Äôs who lost their home to the floods still worry about their future. ‚ÄúI do not know how long we can survive from dry food ‚Äì the only thing left to eat,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe may be alive but we are afraid.‚Äù

"Japan urges pressure on North Korea, military to seek record defence spending","Japan has urged to maintain international pressure on Pyongyang seeking its record defence spending with regard to the latter‚Äôs nuclear programme. (Source: AP Photo) Japan has urged to maintain international pressure on Pyongyang seeking its record defence spending with regard to the latter‚Äôs nuclear programme. (Source: AP Photo)

Japan‚Äôs new foreign minister Taro Kono said on Tuesday international pressure against North Korea must be maintained until Pyongyang clearly demonstrates that it will give up its nuclear programme. Japan‚Äôs military is set to ask for record defence spending of 5.26 trillion yen ($48.12 billion) for the year starting April 1, as it upgrades ballistic missile defences against possible North Korean military action, according to a draft document seen by Reuters. Fears about North Korea‚Äôs missile and nuclear development have grown in recent weeks as Pyongyang in July launched intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and said this month it was considering plans to fire missiles towards the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.

While the North later said it was holding off firing towards Guam, regional tension remains high.

‚ÄúInstead of going straight to dialogue, we need to keep on putting pressure on North Korea until the North clearly demonstrates its intention and action for moving toward (denuclearisation),‚Äù Kono said in an interview with a group of reporters.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the time to discuss (the resumption of) six-party talks,‚Äù Kono said.

Six-party talks, which were aimed at denuclearising the Korean peninsula and involved North and South Korea, China, the United States, Japan and Russia, collapsed in 2008 following a rocket launch by the North.

Kono, who replaced Fumio Kishida as foreign minister in a cabinet reshuffle this month, stressed the importance of implementing fully the existing U.N. sanctions on North Korea.

‚ÄúThere appears to be various loopholes (in the sanctions). These loopholes need to be carefully plugged one by one.‚Äù

Japan‚Äôs Ministry of Defense will request a 2.5 percent hike in defence spending, way above forecasts, according to the a defence paper, which if approved it will be the sixth straight annual increase as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe bolsters his nation‚Äôs military.

A chunk of the money will be used to purchase the first batch of SM-3 Block IIA missiles, which are designed to hit warheads in space before they plunge to their targets, a Japanese government sources said.

The new munition has more than double the range of missiles currently loaded on Japan‚Äôs ballistic missile defence destroyers in the Sea of Japan.

‚ÄúAny easing in defence spending increases would send the wrong message to North Korea and China,‚Äù the source said, asking not to be identified because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

Other spending in the proposed Japanese defence budget includes 88.1 billion yen for six more F-35 stealth fighters, 70 billion yen for a new submarine and 100 billion for two compact warships that will reinforce Japan‚Äôs navy in the East China Sea where it faces growing Chinese naval power, he added.

The proposed budget, however, may be pared back by Ministry of Finance officials who must juggle growing outlays on health and social spending as the nation‚Äôs population ages.

A five-year government defence plan that runs until the end of March 2019 stipulates that annual defence budget increases, minus spending to maintain U.S. military bases, should be limited to 0.8 percent. Japan over the past four years has largely stuck to that rate of increase.

Injustice process,"Lt Col Purohit‚Äôs dysfunctional trial is the norm in terrorism cases in India. Consequences are toxic (Archive) Lt Col Purohit‚Äôs dysfunctional trial is the norm in terrorism cases in India. Consequences are toxic (Archive)

Lieutenant-Colonel Shrikant Purohit walked out of Taloja prison on Wednesday. His story has divided India, and will likely continue to do so, as his trial slowly unfolds. The anger evoked by Purohit‚Äôs prosecution, on charges of having carried out the 2008 Malegaon bombings as part of a terrorist cell that hoped to overthrow the Indian republic and replace it with a Hindu state, says something about how truth is judged along partisan political lines. Perhaps more important, though, it speaks of how a collapsing criminal justice system is eroding public faith in the republic itself. The lieutenant-colonel spent nine years in prison, the better part of a life sentence, before being granted bail by the Supreme Court; charges are yet to be framed against him.

The officer claims he was, in fact, carrying out a surveillance operation on the terror conspirators with the knowledge of his military superiors. The National Investigation Agency, which took over the investigation of the case from Maharashtra Police‚Äôs Anti-Terrorism Squad, believes otherwise. Nine years ought to have been long enough for a court of law to decide the issue on the basis of the evidence. Instead, this period has seen public opinion poisoned by politicians who have preyed on the communal passions unleashed by the case.

The failures of the criminal justice system in Purohit‚Äôs case point to a grave underlying problem: In effect, victory is being ceded in the courtroom to those who could not secure it by violence. Terrorists, after all, claim the Indian state cannot deliver justice, and that is precisely what happens all too often.

Innocent or guilty, Purohit‚Äôs dysfunctional trial is the norm in Indian terrorism cases; alleged jihadists, North-east insurgents and Maoists all routinely spend years in jail. Botched investigations, malicious prosecutions, dilatory proceedings, cumbersome procedures, poorly-framed laws ‚Äî the list of problems is well known, and calls for reform have existed for years. The Purohit case demonstrates just how toxic their consequences can be.

Even as one part of the polity celebrates what ought to be a routine bail order, another sees it as a sign that the government is perverting the course of justice. Things haven‚Äôt been helped by the fact that the Indian Army chose to give the lieutenant-colonel an armed escort of a scale normally reserved only for senior-most officers ‚Äî a poor decision that fuelled speculation that he is receiving privileged treatment. This individual case ought to give no-one reason to do anything other than carefully reflect on the republic‚Äôs state of criminal injustice, and the toll it is inflicting on civic life.

The Trump discontinuity,"US President Donald Trump (AP Photo) US President Donald Trump (AP Photo)

Although India has been quick to welcome President Donald Trump‚Äôs new assertive policy in Afghanistan, sceptics in Delhi would wonder if Washington has the political will to carry through the promised pressure on Pakistan to stop hosting terror sanctuaries on its soil. For Delhi, the question is not whether Trump‚Äôs Afghanistan strategy is a glass half-full or half-empty. It is about seizing the opportunity opened up by his new policy to raise India‚Äôs profile in Afghanistan.

Within hours of his speech earlier this week outlining a new American approach to Afghanistan, Delhi welcomed ‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs determination to enhance efforts to overcome the challenges facing Afghanistan and confronting issues of safe havens and other forms of cross-border support enjoyed by terrorists.‚Äù In his speech Trump had declared that the US ‚Äúcan no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond.‚Äù He demanded that Pakistan‚Äôs support to cross-border terror ‚Äúwill have to change‚Äù and ‚Äúchange immediately‚Äù.

On Trump‚Äôs affirmation that India ought to do more, Delhi pointed to India‚Äôs significant past efforts to promote economic reconstruction in Afghanistan. It added that India ‚Äúwill continue these efforts, including in partnership with other countries‚Äù.

India‚Äôs positive response does not mean that Delhi is unaware of the enduring impulses in Washington to forgive Rawalpindi‚Äôs transgressions in Afghanistan. Whatever the US president might say, there are large sections of the US deep state that caution against a radical shift in US policy towards Pakistan. Few countries have gotten away so long with what Trump has accused Pakistan of doing: Pakistan shelters ‚Äúthe same organisations that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists we are fighting.‚Äù

If the US has tolerated this for the last 17 years, Delhi has good reason to be cautious in its assessment of what the Trump Administration can compel the Pakistan Army to do today. In any case, what we heard is a mere speech. Turning the words of that speech into actions of the ground will not be easy. Delhi has no reason to hold its breath. While scepticism is healthy, cynicism that ignores the changes taking place in the US regional policy is not. After all, Trump has said something about Pakistan in public that his predecessors were not willing to. If the previous administration acquiesced in Pakistan‚Äôs double dealing on terror, Trump has threatened Rawalpindi with consequences if it does not change its behaviour.

It is equally important for Delhi to note the shift in Washington‚Äôs thinking on the Indian role in Afghanistan. The Bush Administration‚Äôs strategic warmth towards India was expansive. It wanted to help accelerate India‚Äôs rise and invested enormous political capital in getting the world to lift a four decades-old nuclear blockade against Delhi. Yet when it came to Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Bush Administration drew a red line for India. It cautioned Delhi against too large a role in Afghanistan. The Obama Administration began with the proposition that the answer to Afghanistan might lie in promoting a resolution of Pakistan‚Äôs Kashmir dispute with India. It required intensive diplomacy from India to fend off these initiatives.

Delhi must necessarily keep its eyes open for a return of these familiar themes in the US approach to Pakistan. At the same time, India must also appreciate the most important change in US Afghan policy. Until recently, Washington believed that India‚Äôs rivalry with Pakistan is part of the problem in Afghanistan. Today Trump might be betting that by invoking a larger Indian role in Afghanistan, he might add to the pressures on Pakistan to cooperate with the US.

Despite all the talk of playing the China card against the US, Pakistan is acutely conscious of the dangers of being treated as a rogue state by the West. Its thundering silence in response to the Trump speech, suggests that Rawalpindi has chosen to avoid, for now, a public argument with Washington.

The Pakistan Army will try and find ways to limit Trump‚Äôs fire and fury. It will not be easy, however, for Pakistan to abandon its investments in cross-border terror. It would try and finesse the issue of terror sanctuaries. Rawalpindi will offer some cooperation in countering terror and make new promises to bring the Taliban to the table. It will urge US pressure on India to start talks on Kashmir.

While India must prepare for the possibility of the US slipping back to its old ways on Pakistan, Delhi‚Äôs current emphasis must be on taking advantage of the Trump discontinuity in the American policy towards the Subcontinent. A positive Indian approach would involve three elements ‚Äî economic, security and diplomatic.

For one, India must ramp up its economic diplomacy in Afghanistan to bring immediate benefits to Kabul amidst the deteriorating conditions in the country. Second, Delhi must step up security cooperation with Afghanistan, especially in the training of its police and armed forces and intelligence sharing. Third, on the diplomatic front, India must counter the emerging argument that Trump‚Äôs new approach will intensify the ‚ÄúIndo-Pak rivalry‚Äù in Afghanistan and the old one that Kashmir holds the key to peace in Afghanistan.

Delhi must remind the world of India‚Äôs commitment to regional cooperation with Afghanistan and Pakistan, in an atmosphere free of terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had articulated this vision in an address to the Afghan parliament on December 25, 2015. Shortly after declaring that Pakistan can be a bridge between India and Afghanistan, the PM had traveled to Lahore on very short notice to wish Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on his birthday. Pakistan‚Äôs army responded by launching a terror attack in Pathankot a few days later.

Trump‚Äôs new Afghan strategy could be a potential game-changer for South Asia or a brief exception to the familiar pattern of US-Pak relations. While recognising the potential shadow between Trump‚Äôs words and deeds, Delhi must bet on its own activism that can influence future outcomes in Afghanistan.

"Kumkum Bhagya 24th August 2017 full episode written update: Sangram Singh takes Abhi‚Äôs family as hostage, Munni rescues Disha","Kumkum Bhagya 24th August 2017 full episode written update: Sangram Singh is about to cut Purab with the sword power cut takes place. Kumkum Bhagya 24th August 2017 full episode written update: Sangram Singh is about to cut Purab with the sword power cut takes place.

Sangram Singh‚Äôs goons lock the main dancer in the green room, she asks them who are they and one of them hit her head and make her unconscious. There Dadi and Dasi ask Purab and Disha to dance while Purab and Disha feel shy and Munni gets excited and says she‚Äôll tell then the steps and they all start dancing while Aaliya calls her and asks what she is doing. She says she loves dancing and she used to dance in every wedding at her village. Aaliya asks her to not forget her motive of being here and she says this is why she is dancing or else Dadi would doubt why isn‚Äôt she happy. Dasi comes and takes Munni to dance floor when Sangram Singh unveils her face and puts sword on Purab‚Äôs neck and one of his goon holds Disha and puts a sword on her neck. All of them hold all the family members and Sangram Singh asks his goons to lock the guests in a room. Sangram Singh tells that Purab stole his bride and now he‚Äôll kill him and will take Disha along. Disha asks him to go and don‚Äôt hurt Purab and Sangram says he‚Äôll now first kill him. While Abhi is still in his study he says to Rishabh that he‚Äôll call once Purab is free from the wedding, as he was about to leave the room he sees Purab‚Äôs picture on projected wall and thinks Aaliya must have done this and he won‚Äôt let her ruin Purab‚Äôs wedding and he pulls out the wires from the socket which leads to short circuit.

As Sangram Singh is about to cut Purab with the sword power cut takes place. Sangram says no one will move or he‚Äôll chop Purab‚Äôs head and asks one of his goon to go and check the main switch. The goon asks Raj about where the switch is and Raj says he doesn‚Äôt know but he puts sword on Tauji‚Äôs neck and Raj gives in. Meanwhile Munni thinks that power cut is Ramji‚Äôs hint to her to help Purab and Disha. Munni sneaks out taking Disha along and takes her upstairs. Sangram Singh thinks he never has any work done without hurdles. Mitali speaks in an imitated voice that he is right and he wants to do overcome this hurdle alive he must leave. Sangram Singh asks who it is and thinks the people in this house are too cleaver and Mitali again says he is right and now he‚Äôll have to regret. Sangram Singh warns that whoever it is should stop or he‚Äôll kill Purab. Raj mends the circuit and lights are on. Sangram Singh asks where is Disha.

Pro Kabaddi 2017: Haryana Steelers pip Dabang Delhi in a thrilling encounter,"Haryana Steelers registered 27-25 win over Dabang Delhi. (Source: AP) Haryana Steelers registered 27-25 win over Dabang Delhi. (Source: AP)

It was the first time that Haryana Steelers dominated a game from the word go. Deepak Kumar Dhaiya proved to be salient for the Steelers as they registered a narrow 27-25 win over Dabang Delhi in Lucknow. However, a late surge from Meraj Sheykh brought his side back into the game before Steelers sealed the game by taking the Delhi captain down in the left corner.

While Surender Nada and Mohit Chhillar commanded Haryana to a strapping start, the debutants forced the first all out on Delhi in the seventh minute itself. Haryana Steelers were cruising smoothly while Delhi raiders found it difficult in breaking through Steelers‚Äô defence. The score at half time was 17-9.

With Haryana dominating most of the game, Delhi managed to recover with Meraj Sheykh‚Äôs successful raid in the third minute of the second half. Meraj‚Äôs full body dive in the do-or-die raid not only got them two points but sent Nada and Mohit out of the mat. With both the key defenders taken off, Haryana were soon forced an all-out.

If the first few minutes of the second half belonged to Haryana, the latter minutes were Delhi‚Äôs. The momentum shifted to Delhi with Abolfazl Maghsodlou coming into support of Meraj. The Iranian duo brought the score to 19-19. Which was followed by back to back successful raids from Meraj bringing Delhi into the game.

In the dying minutes of the game, Haryana surged ahead picking two quick points and took full advantage of Meraj‚Äôs unsuccessful raid to register their third win and move to second spot in Zone A points table.

If you‚Äôre looking for celeb fitness inspiration then Alia Bhatt‚Äôs workout routine might make you want to hit the gym. She is no slouch when it comes to her performances on-screen and definitely not one when it comes to staying fit. The Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya actor has worked really hard to get the toned body she has today with the help of celebrity fitness trainer Yasmin Karachiwala. According to reports, she weighed around 67kg when she was 17 and lost around 16kg in just three months when she was shortlisted for her debut film Student of the Year.

Today, all of 24, the actress can often be seen sharing inspirational workout videos with her followers on Instagram, documenting her journey in a way. From working out on the Pilates machine Cadillac to the extremely difficult back-bend bridge, handstand, crunches and Jack Rabbit, she does it all. This beauty doesn‚Äôt like repeating workouts, so Karachiwala has her hitting different machines like the corealign, reformer, Wunda chair, step barrel and the Bodhi suspension system.

As far as her diet is concerned, she has a major sweet tooth and is a fan of Pooja Dhingra‚Äôs Le 15 Patisserie and Chef Kelvin Cheung‚Äôs delectable cakes, but she is also a stickler for discipline and probably that‚Äôs what helps her the most.

Bhatt also believes in eating everything in moderation. Recently, she teamed up with celebrity dietician Rujuta Diwekar for a Facebook live session, in which she talked about her body secrets. Shattering the concept of following the online food trends, she said, ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs talking about gluten-free pizza, brown bread, and red rice, about reducing their carb intake, and I‚Äôm eating white bread and butter at 4am. Rujuta showed me how local food eaten in moderation can be healthy.‚Äù

In the past, she has even shared photos of her enjoying bread on Instagram, which is a no-no for fitness freaks. ‚ÄúWho knew a piece of malt bread with avocado, tomatoes and a poached egg would make me so happy?,‚Äù she wrote.

"Earthquake hits Italian island, buildings collapse","Debris lie on a road after an earthquake hit the island of Ischia, near Naples, Southern Italy, Monday, Aug. 21, 2017.(Mauro Iovino/ANSA via AP) Debris lie on a road after an earthquake hit the island of Ischia, near Naples, Southern Italy, Monday, Aug. 21, 2017.(Mauro Iovino/ANSA via AP)

An earthquake measuring 3.6 magnitude hit the island of Ischia, off the coast of Naples, on Monday night, officials said, and first reports said one person was killed and at least 20 people injured in the collapse of several buildings.

Residents and tourists on the island, which is crowded at the height of the summer season, ran out on to the streets from homes and hospitals.

Television images showed that about six buildings in the town of Casamicciola as well as a church had collapsed in the quake, which hit at 8:57 p.m. (1857 GMT).

Roberto Allocca, a doctor from a local hospital, told Sky TG24 television that at least 20 people had been treated for minor injuries. Most of the hospital had been evacuated and the injured were treated outside. Media reports said one woman was killed when she was hit by falling rubble from a church.

Civil protection squads were already on the island because of brushfires and more were arriving from the mainland.

The television reports said the buildings that collapsed appeared to have been inhabited and a number of people were still unaccounted for.

America‚Äôs 16 years in Afghanistan: From triumph to stalemate,"U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer. (Source: Reuters) U.S. President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address from Fort Myer. (Source: Reuters)

Sixteen years of U.S. warfare in Afghanistan have left the insurgents as strong as ever and the nation‚Äôs future precarious. Facing a quagmire, President Donald Trump on Monday outlined his strategy for ‚Äúvictory‚Äù in a country that has historically snared great powers and defied easy solutions. Sixteen years of U.S. warfare in Afghanistan have left the insurgents as strong as ever and the nation‚Äôs future precarious.

Facing a quagmire, President Donald Trump on Monday outlined his strategy for ‚Äúvictory‚Äù in a country that has historically snared great powers and defied easy solutions. America‚Äôs longest-running war began well as U.S.-led forces quickly toppled the Taliban government and disrupted al-Qaida leaders who plotted the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks from Afghan soil. But the fighting never ended.

In recent years, security has gradually worsened as Taliban insurgents, enjoying sanctuary in Pakistan, have gained a foothold across the country. Afghanistan‚Äôs rampant heroin trade, official corruption and infighting among the nation‚Äôs elite have only compounded problems. Trump is the third U.S. president to grapple with the Afghan challenge. A look at the phases of the U.S. involvement to date:

REGIME CHANGE

Less than a month after the 9/11 attacks, a massive U.S. air campaign targets al-Qaida fighters and Taliban troops, training camps and air defenses. Anti-Taliban forces of the Northern Alliance enter Kabul as the Taliban flee. By December 2001, Afghan groups agree on a deal in Bonn, Germany, for an interim government. With Afghanistan liberated from Taliban control, the U.S. military force grows to 2,500 as troops scour the mountainous Tora Bora region looking for al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. He eludes capture. Although President George W. Bush remains leery of supporting nation-building efforts in Afghanistan, the U.S. expands its counter terrorism operations. By the end of 2002, there are 9,700 U.S. troops in the country.

DEMOCRACY AND DISTRACTION

In November 2004, Hamid Karzai, who had served two years as interim leader, is the clear winner in Afghanistan‚Äôs first direct election for president. The Bush administration hails the vote as a key step in the nation‚Äôs transformation. Millions of girls return to school after being barred under the Taliban. As the country opens up, Western aid helps the economy grow, at least in urban areas. But the Taliban, enjoying sanctuary in Pakistan, show signs of re-emergence, launching sporadic attacks on government forces in eastern Afghanistan. Although Karzai is an ethnic Pashtun, which comprise the bulk of Taliban recruits, his government alienates what is Afghanistan‚Äôs main ethnic group. Karzai‚Äôs administration is dominated by former commanders of the Northern Alliance.

U.S. troop numbers swell to 20,000, but Washington‚Äôs attention increasingly turns to Iraq. The U.S. invades in March 2003, toppling Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It struggles with the aftermath. Soon Iraq is gripped by an explosion of sectarian violence that preoccupies Bush until he leaves office.

MORE WESTERN TROOPS, MORE VIOLENCE

In 2006, NATO assumes responsibility for security across the whole of Afghanistan, pumping troops into Taliban heartlands in the south of the country. The U.S. ups its forces in the country to 30,000. Britain, Canada and others boost their contributions. But the violence and lawlessness worsens. Production of opium, the raw material of heroin, soars to a record high, funding the insurgency and fueling official corruption. Tensions grow between Afghanistan and Pakistan over cross-border Taliban attacks. In the fall of 2008, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Adm. Mike Mullen concedes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôre winning.‚Äù

SURGE

President Barack Obama, vowing to refocus U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, enters office in 2009 endorsing shifts to a counterinsurgency strategy designed to protect Afghan civilians rather than hunt down Taliban. He quickly sends in 21,000 more forces. After a prolonged policy review, Obama orders an additional surge, bringing troop levels to a high of 100,000 by August 2010. He says the U.S. will begin withdrawing forces by 2011. Critics say the drawdown date diminishes the incentive for the Taliban to negotiate for peace. Bin Laden is killed in a U.S. special operations raid in Pakistan in March 2011. Obama then presses ahead with plans to hand over security responsibilities to Afghanistan by 2014. By the end of that year, NATO ends its combat mission in the country. U.S. relations with Karzai, however, deteriorate. A contested election to replace Karzai introduces a more pro-U.S. leader in Ashraf Ghani, but his government is bitterly divided.

NO WITHDRAWAL

With violence reaching post-2001 highs and Afghan security forces taking heavy casualties, Obama backtracks on plans to virtually withdraw all U.S. forces by the end of 2016. He leaves office with 8,400 troops still in the country. The U.S. kills new Taliban leader Mullah Mansour in a drone attack in Pakistan in May 2016, derailing peace talks. But on the battlefield, the Taliban are in the ascendant and threaten provincial capitals in both the north and south. The Islamic State group gains a foothold in eastern Afghanistan.

ENTER TRUMP

Trump says little about Afghanistan during his first seven months in office, while the military grows antsy. The Pentagon proposes sending in nearly 4,000 more U.S. troops to increase training of Afghan forces and counter terrorism operations, but the administration is divided on strategy. Nearly everyone considers the fight a stalemate, and some in Trump‚Äôs administration even propose withdrawing or handing over the entire American effort to private security contractors. Among Afghans, anti-Western sentiment grows over deteriorating security, even in the capital, Kabul. The economy also suffers, partly as a result of a draw down in foreign forces. As Trump is poised to announce his plan, Afghanistan‚Äôs government controls only about half of the country. After months of debate, Trump finally unveils his strategy in a prime-time television address. He says the U.S. will win ‚Äúin the end,‚Äù defeating al-Qaida and IS fighters, and ensuring the government doesn‚Äôt fall to the Taliban. He refuses to provide troop increase numbers or timelines, saying military assistance would be determined by results and the cooperation of Afghanistan‚Äôs beleaguered government.

Four suspected Barcelona attack plotters appear in court,"People stand next to candles and flower tributes placed on the ground after a terror attack that killed 14 people and wounded over 120 in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) People stand next to candles and flower tributes placed on the ground after a terror attack that killed 14 people and wounded over 120 in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

Four men accused of being members of an Islamist cell behind a van attack that killed 13 people in Barcelona last week appeared in court on Tuesday, a day after the alleged driver was shot dead by police. The four, the only ones still alive among the 12 men thought to constitute the group, were brought from Barcelona to Madrid where they were taken to the High Court under tight security for the hearing.

Police on Monday shot dead 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub, who they had identified as the driver of the van that careered along the packed Las Ramblas boulevard in Barcelona on Thursday, leaving a trail of dead and 120 injured from 34 countries. After the attack, Abouyaaqoub escaped on foot, stabbing to death a man who was parking his car and fleeing in the vehicle.

Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia said on Tuesday he walked some 40 km (25 miles) from Sant Just Desvern, the town on the outskirts of Barcelona where he ditched the hijacked car, to Subirats, where he was shot dead. Abouyaaqoub, who had changed clothes, walked by night and hid during the day, the paper said citing sources involved in the investigation. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the van attack and a separate deadly assault, hours later, in the coastal resort of Cambrils, south of Barcelona.

In Cambrils, a car rammed into passers-by and its occupants got out and tried to stab people. The five assailants were shot dead by police, while a Spanish woman died in the attack. Most of the 12 suspects lived in the town of Ripoll, set in forested hills beneath the Pyrenees north of Barcelona near the French border, and most were young men of Moroccan descent.

One of those who appeared before investigating magistrate Fernando Andreu was Driss Oukabir, whose passport was found in the abandoned van after the Barcelona attack. He turned himself in to police, protesting his innocence and saying his younger brother Moussa Oukabir, 17, who was killed in Cambrils, had stolen his documents. Also in court was Mohammed Aalla, owner of the Audi car used in the Cambrils attack. One of his brothers, Said, was killed in Cambrils and a second, Youssef, is believed by police to have died in an explosion at a house used by the plotters at Alcanar, southwest of Barcelona, the day before the Barcelona attack.

Mohamed Houli Chemlal, arrested after being hurt in the blast at Alcanar, also appeared in court as did Salah el Karib, who ran an internet cafe in Ripoll that, according to La Vanguardia newspaper, was used to send money to Morocco. At Tuesday‚Äôs closed-door hearing, Andreu planned to read out charges against the men expected to include counts of terrorism, murder and weapons possession. Andreu was then to ask the accused if they wish to testify, in which case he would question them.

The hearing was likely to end in the suspects being remanded in custody while the judge conducts an investigation that could take months or even years before a trial is organised. A Ripoll imam who police suspect may have radicalised the young men, Abdelbaki Es Satty, is believed to have died in the explosion in Alcanar. Police believe the blast foiled the group‚Äôs plans for a much bigger attack using explosives.

Even better, imagine leaving all your worries behind and getting to live in a luxury resort, no less. What if we say along with all the plush extravagance you will find at your beck and call in this luxurious stay, you will find just another amenity at this specific luxury stay in Colombia? What amenity? Sex. You heard us!

In what is already creating ripples and controversies across the world, a brothel in Colombia has expanded into an all-inclusive sex resort.

An amazing resort with private villas and the most beautiful Colombian women. A discreet and beautiful environment for men to fulfill their wildest fantasies,‚Äù the website proudly proclaims.

According to the website, other than gorging on delicious food and availing all the other facilities that a luxury stay provides, Good Girls‚Äô Sex Resort also offers to change people‚Äôs ‚Äúfantasies into reality‚Äù. ‚ÄúGood Girls is a resort where you are attended by the most beautiful Latin women, who will be your guardian angels for as long as you decide,‚Äù they claim.

The resort assures that they prioritise your safety and privacy as long as you stay there and guarantee ‚Äúabsolute discretion‚Äù of the details of your trip at the resort.

Prostitution is known to be legal in Colombia, under the condition that it is carried out in designated ‚Äútolerance zones‚Äù. Reasons like poverty and displacement due to financial restraints have resulted in prostitution becoming widespread and rampant in the country.

NBA: Cleveland Cavaliers trade Kyrie Irving to Boston Celtics for Isaiah Thomas,"Kyrie Irving had demanded a trade to be the focal point of a team, something he couldn‚Äôt do alongside LeBron James. (Source: AP) Kyrie Irving had demanded a trade to be the focal point of a team, something he couldn‚Äôt do alongside LeBron James. (Source: AP)

Kyrie Irving was tired of being teammates with LeBron James. Now he has to figure out how to beat him. Cleveland‚Äôs All-Star guard, who asked owner Dan Gilbert to trade him earlier this summer, was dealt Tuesday night to the Boston Celtics for fellow All-Star Isaiah Thomas, forward Jae Crowder, center Ante Zizic and the Brooklyn Nets‚Äô unprotected 2018 first-round draft pick.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extremely rare to trade for a 25-year-old player that‚Äôs done what he‚Äôs done, the offensive weapon that he is,‚Äù Celtics president Danny Ainge said. ‚ÄúWe feel like his best basketball is still ahead of him.

‚ÄúWe have a player that‚Äôs proven to be a sure thing. We know how unpredictable the draft can be. You do pay a heavy price for a player of that age and that caliber.‚Äù

Irving, whose late 3-pointer helped Cleveland win the 2016 NBA championship ‚Äì and the city‚Äôs first title since 1964 ‚Äì is on his way to Boston, where he‚Äôll join a Celtics team that lost to the Cavs in last season‚Äôs conference finals.

And as fate will have it, the Cavs will host the Celtics in their season opener on Oct. 17.

‚ÄúOf course we know who our competition is, and we know who are biggest threats are each year,‚Äù Ainge said. ‚ÄúBut we feel like this is a trade that can make us better, and that‚Äôs why we did it.‚Äù

The blockbuster deal caps a wild summer for the Cavs, who lost their title defense in five games to Golden State in June. Since then, general manager David Griffin left, the team failed to convince Chauncey Billups to join its front office and James has played with fans‚Äô emotions with veiled postings on social media about his future.

Irving‚Äôs trade demand cast a shadow over the entire organization.

But Cleveland may have salvaged its offseason.

‚ÄúThis trade needed to include both players and assets that we felt strongly could help us continue to compete for championships and we believe it does,‚Äù said new general manager Koby Altman, who pulled off a deal that protects Cleveland‚Äôs present and future.

In Thomas, they‚Äôre getting a proven playmaker with a stellar reputation. The 5-foot-9 guard is one of the league‚Äôs most dynamic backcourt players with an uncanny ability to get to the basket. Irving may be the only better finisher among point guards.

The 28-year-old Thomas was taken with the final selection in the 2011 draft ‚Äì 59 picks after Irving was picked first overall. But he has steadily scaled his way up to elite status.

Thomas‚Äô reputation in Boston was cemented when he led the Celtics through the playoffs last season despite the death of his sister on the eve of the postseason. He also had a front tooth knocked out during the second-round series against Washington and a hip injury eventually forced the team to shut him down early in the East finals, won by the Cavaliers in five games.

‚ÄúIsaiah had just an amazing season this year and entertained us all, the whole city of Boston. And everybody fell in love with him,‚Äù Ainge said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs such an underdog because of his size and his heart and his spirit which he plays.‚Äù

Thomas is eligible for free agency next summer and believes he is worthy of a maximum contract. He has been quoted saying, ‚ÄúThey better bring out the Brinks truck.‚Äù

Cleveland also is getting Crowder, a solid perimeter defender, and a first-round pick that Boston got from Brooklyn. The package could help the Cavs reload if James opts out of his contract next summer and leaves Cleveland for a second time.

The Cavs drafted Irving with the No. 1 overall pick in 2011. He struggled in his first few seasons but blossomed in recent years alongside James. However, that didn‚Äôt seem to be enough for the 25-year-old, who has wanted to be the focal point on his own team.

Asked about trading a fan favorite who rose from the depths of the draft for a player who asked out of a team with the NBA‚Äôs best player, one year removed from a championship, Ainge said he has done his homework.

‚ÄúWe feel comfortable with who Kyrie is and who he can be,‚Äù he said.

Minnesota showed some interest in Irving after his trade request became public, but were unwilling to part with young star Andrew Wiggins as the centerpiece of a deal. Wiggins is expected to sign a max contract extension in the coming weeks to stay with the Timberwolves.

The Phoenix Suns reportedly were not interested in parting with rookie Josh Jackson in a deal that also would have required Eric Bledsoe and the New York Knicks gave no indication that Kristaps Porzingis was ever on the table in a potential Irving trade.

Then the Celtics swooped in, landing the kind of star Ainge has long coveted. With the possibility of having to break the bank to retain Thomas next summer, Boston finally tapped into the treasure trove of assets that Ainge has assembled to get Irving, who is under contract for two more years.

Irving got his wish to get away from James, but he‚Äôs not free of him yet.

US Navy to relieve Seventh fleet commander Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin of duty after collisions,"FILE PHOTO: Seventh Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin (Source: REUTERS) FILE PHOTO: Seventh Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin (Source: REUTERS)

The commander of the US Navy‚Äôs Seventh Fleet will be relieved of his duty following a deadly collision between a destroyer and a merchant vessel, the latest in a spate of similar accidents, a defence official has said.

The decision to remove Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin from the post in Japan comes as the Navy is undertaking a fleet-wide global investigation in the wake of the incident Monday involving the USS John S. McCain which left 10 sailors missing and five injured.

It was the second fatal collision in two months ‚Äî coming after the USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-flagged cargo ship off Japan in June, leaving seven sailors dead ‚Äìand the fourth accident in the Pacific this year involving an American warship. The incidents have sparked concern that the US Navy could be overstretched in East Asia ‚Äî both ships belonged to the Seventh Fleet ‚Äî as it tackles China‚Äôs rising assertiveness and North Korea‚Äôs nuclear ambitions.

The latest accident happened before dawn in busy shipping lanes around the Strait of Singapore, and sent water flooding into the vessel. A massive search involving planes and aircraft was launched and US Navy divers joined the hunt yesterday, scouring the ship‚Äôs flooded compartments. Divers have found remains of some of the sailors, Admiral Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, said on Tuesday.

The McCain had been heading for a routine stop in Singapore after carrying out a ‚Äúfreedom of navigation operation‚Äù in the disputed South China Sea earlier in August, sparking a furious response from Beijing. On Monday the Chief of US Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson ordered commanders within a week to set aside time, perhaps ‚Äúone or two days,‚Äù for crews to sit down together for discussions. A ‚Äúcomprehensive review‚Äù of practices would also begin.

The admiral did not rule out some kind of outside interference or a cyber-attack being behind the latest collision, but said he did not want to prejudge the inquiry. His broader remarks suggested a focus on ‚Äúhow we do business on the bridge.‚Äù

New Afghanistan plan could offer clues to ‚ÄòTrump Doctrine‚Äô,"As a candidate and then as president, Trump has eluded those who have tried to identify core beliefs that can reliably predict how he‚Äôll approach any given issue. (AP Photo/Rahmat Gul) As a candidate and then as president, Trump has eluded those who have tried to identify core beliefs that can reliably predict how he‚Äôll approach any given issue. (AP Photo/Rahmat Gul)

Never tip your hand to the enemy. No timelines for military operations. No free pass for a neighbor who tolerates extremists or enables U.S. foes.

In President Donald Trump‚Äôs new Afghanistan strategy, elements of a broader approach to America‚Äôs most pressing national security concerns begin to emerge, consistent with his efforts in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Though details are limited, the plan draws on organizing principles that are also woven throughout his plans for defeating the Islamic State group and containing the threats posed by North Korea and Iran.

Trump‚Äôs advisers say his Afghan strategy reflects a consistent world view, both in terms of America‚Äôs overseas objectives and the tactics to achieve them. But it‚Äôs too soon to say whether he is being driven by a well-formed doctrine or merely coining catchphrases on the fly.

‚ÄúWe are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists,‚Äù Trump said in his Monday night speech. He was striving to differentiate his plan from failed approaches of the past.

As a candidate and then as president, Trump has eluded those who have tried to identify core beliefs that can reliably predict how he‚Äôll approach any given issue. Critics have painted him as a foreign policy novice, focused only on somehow showing he‚Äôs winning.

Trump ran on a nationalist pledge to put ‚ÄúAmerica First.‚Äù But he explained this week that things look different from the Oval Office. Conceding he was overriding an initial instinct to withdraw from Afghanistan, he peppered his speech with vows to empower commanders and to squeeze Pakistan for harboring the Taliban.

While Trump has cast his approach as a fundamental shift from other presidents, he‚Äôs borrowed more from them than he‚Äôs inclined to admit.

George W. Bush, too, sought to pressure Pakistan to crack down on the Taliban, even as he focused far more on an idea Trump is explicitly rejecting: promoting democracy around the world.

And Trump‚Äôs limited approach owes something to Barack Obama, who in his second term scaled back U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan and settled on a counterterror-focused mission not dissimilar from the new American strategy.

A look at the pillars of Trump‚Äôs foreign policy:

___

MIND YOUR BUSINESS

The days of the U.S. military trying to ‚Äúconstruct democracies‚Äù are over, Trump declared. Instead, he said ‚Äúprincipled realism‚Äù will guide U.S. decisions.

That means there will be none of Bush‚Äôs ‚Äúnation-building‚Äù _ no expansive goal to build up Afghanistan‚Äôs institutions and ensure the education of girls once the U.S. ultimately withdraws.

Trump‚Äôs approach in Syria is similar. There, as the Islamic State is ousted from its last major strongholds and a power vacuum results, Trump‚Äôs administration has said it wants to help restore electricity, water and sewage in areas freed from IS _ but no more. In Iraq, the situation is somewhat easier because there‚Äôs a globally backed central government.

In Afghanistan, some questions still must be cleared up. Despite his vow of non-interference, Trump emphasized he could hold back future military and economic aid unless the Afghan government combats problems including rampant corruption.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to tell these countries how to govern, but we‚Äôre going to condition our assistance on reforms _ that‚Äôs an internal contradiction,‚Äù said James Dobbins, a senior diplomat in the past three administrations and former special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan.

___

KEEP YOUR PLANS QUIET

Of all the critiques of Trump‚Äôs plan, the loudest is that he declined to tell Americans how many more U.S. troops will be sent to Afghanistan after 16 years of fighting.

His rationale is simple: Deny the Taliban and other extremists the advantage of anticipating U.S. military moves.

However, the contours of the Pentagon‚Äôs plan have been known for months. Senior officials said Tuesday up to 3,900 more troops will go, some possibly within days.

Being unpredictable to U.S. adversaries has been a consistent Trump focus. The president was similarly coy in April in the days before he attacked Syrian President Bashar Assad‚Äôs forces for using chemical weapons. He has repeatedly refused to entertain questions about a potential pre-emptive attack on North Korea.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt talk about that. I never do,‚Äù Trump has said.

___

DON‚ÄôT ‚ÄúMICROMANAGE‚Äù

Rather than centralize military decision-making in the White House, a critique often leveled at Obama, Trump has delegated much of the authority to his defense secretary and war zone commanders.

‚ÄúMicromanagement from Washington, D.C., does not win battles,‚Äù he said in his Afghanistan speech.

Even before he unveiled his Afghan plan, the White House announced he‚Äôd given the Pentagon final say on how many troops to send. And in April, his top commander in Afghanistan was allowed to use the ‚Äúmother of all bombs,‚Äù the largest non-nuclear bomb ever dropped in combat. There was no need for the White House signoff.

Trump has similarly ceded decision-making about military actions in Syria and Iraq to his commanders, along with decisions about counterterror strikes against targets in several countries.

‚ÄúHe clearly is much more willing to give the military latitude on tactical decision than President Obama was,‚Äù said Ambassador James Jeffrey, Bush‚Äôs former deputy national security adviser. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all in all a good thing for this kind of conflict.‚Äù

CRACKDOWN ON ENABLERS

As Trump vowed to get tough on Pakistan, accusing it of giving ‚Äúsafe haven to agents of chaos, violence and terror,‚Äù diplomatic and military officials heard echoes of his plan for North Korea.

For more than a decade, the U.S. has pressed Islamabad to snuff out Taliban sanctuaries. Many of the group‚Äôs leaders reside in Pakistan, traveling freely across the Afghanistan border. Taliban wounded are treated in Pakistani hospitals.

With North Korea, it‚Äôs China that must feel the weight of U.S. pressure, Trump has said. He has tried to squeeze Beijing into cutting off lifelines of economic support to North Korea to make it harder for Pyongyang to develop weapons that could harm the U.S.

LET LOCALS LEAD

In Afghanistan, as in Iraq and Syria, Trump‚Äôs plan centers on training local forces to fight insurgents rather than relying on Americans to do most of the fighting. While the same strategy was employed by Obama, Trump has claimed credit since taking office.

‚ÄúThe confidence that the American people and the world heard last night from our commander in chief derives from the fact that this is exactly the approach that President Trump directed in Iraq and in Syria,‚Äù Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday.

Belgium gave ‚Äòinformal‚Äô tip to Catalan police about imam: Report,"People gather at a memorial tribute of flowers, messages and candles to the victims on Barcelona‚Äôs historic Las Ramblas promenade on the Joan Miro mosaic, embedded in the pavement where the van stopped after killing at least 13 people in Barcelona. (Source: AP) People gather at a memorial tribute of flowers, messages and candles to the victims on Barcelona‚Äôs historic Las Ramblas promenade on the Joan Miro mosaic, embedded in the pavement where the van stopped after killing at least 13 people in Barcelona. (Source: AP)

A Belgian policeman told a Catalan colleague in 2016 that the imam believed to be the instigator of last week‚Äôs attack in Barcelona was suspicious, but no information was found back then to link him to Islamist militancy, a source told Reuters. Police in the northeast Spanish region of Catalonia are coming under growing criticism over the van attack that killed 13 people. Two others were killed during the driver‚Äôs getaway and in a separate attack further down the coast.

Several Spanish media accused Catalan police on Thursday of failing to properly investigate the Moroccan imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty. Meanwhile a wider blame game is being played out between central authorities in Madrid and officials in Catalonia, whose leaders are pushing for independence from Spain. The tip-off about the imam was made informally between two police officials from Belgium and Catalonia who knew each other, a source in Catalonia‚Äôs regional government said.

‚ÄúThe communication between the two policemen was not official. They knew each other because they had met in a police seminar,‚Äù the source said, on condition of anonymity. Police records, however, had turned up nothing on the cleric. ‚ÄúThe documents show that we had no information about the imam,‚Äù the source said, adding that the only official communication channels of the Catalan police, the Mossos d‚ÄôEsquadra, with police in other countries were through Spain‚Äôs central government.

The Catalan regional government and Spain‚Äôs central government declined to comment. It remains unclear whether Catalan police made their own attempts to follow up on the lead. Es Satty spent around three months in the Belgian town of Vilvoorde, a known centre of Islamist radicalism, between January and March last year. He later went to Catalonia as the imam of the small town of Ripoll, where he is suspected of having recruited and radicalised most of the group which carried last week‚Äôs attacks.

Hans Bonte, mayor of Vilvoorde, said last week that Es Satty had been ‚Äúintensely screened‚Äù by Belgian police at the time, and he had told Spanish police by email of his whereabouts. El Pais newspaper quoted Bonte on Thursday as saying he had received a reply from police in Barcelona on March 8 last year. ‚ÄúThey said the imam had no links to radical groups,‚Äù he said.

Sources close to the investigation told Reuters earlier this week the regional Catalan force may have missed an opportunity to uncover the plot because of procedural errors and a lack of communication among investigators. The errors and miscommunication centred around a major blast on Aug. 16, the eve of the attack, at a house where it was later discovered that suspected Islamist militants were making explosives, the sources said.

ICC welcomes World XI Tour of Pakistan,"Faf du Plessis will lead World XI. (Source: AP) Faf du Plessis will lead World XI. (Source: AP)

The International Cricket Council is hoping that the World XI tour will pave way for more high-profile series in the coming future and the international cricket will return to the nation with more nations visiting there.

‚ÄúI am delighted that Pakistan will be hosting a high-profile series, which features several top international cricketers from a number of ICC Members.

‚ÄúThis tour is not only important for cricket in Pakistan but also for international cricket since it opens the possibility of other teams, media and sponsors visiting Pakistan for bilateral series,‚Äù said Clarke.

‚ÄúPakistan has been an important member of the ICC and the cricket community has felt its pain. As part of its duty of care, the cricket community has always ensured that the sport is not affected due to no fault of the PCB, when it has continued to play its away series off-shore.‚Äù

Sri Lanka and West Indies have agreed to play T20Is series in Pakistan after the World XI tour. Both teams will assess the situation afte the World XI tour and will decide to tour Pakistan in October and November.

Apart from Zimmbabwe in 2015, no top team has visited Pakistan since March 2009 when the Sri Lankan team bus was attacked inin Lahore.

Pakistan Cricket Board chief Najam Sethi also thanked everyone who helped bring cricket back to Pakistan. He said that a security delegation will be coming to Lahore in September to see the arragements.

‚ÄúThis tour is different as the ICC has supported us all the way and its security delegation will be coming to Lahore in first week of September to inspect the security arrangements and plans,‚Äù PCB chief Najam Sethi said.

According to the schedule, the World XI will play three T20 internationalson September 12, 13 and 15 in Lahore after holding a two-day camp in Dubai.

ICC Chief Executive David Richardson, who has visited the country many a times, said that ICC wants to see regular international cricket with all member countries playing in Pakistan.

‚ÄúThe ICC wants to see regular international cricket being played safely in all its Member countries and the World XI playing Pakistan in Lahore next month is a step towards that for the PCB.

‚ÄúThe PCB‚Äôs plans for the tour will include comprehensive security arrangements for the safety and security of the players, officials, media and spectators. As such, the ICC is fully supportive of these games. That said, all the stakeholders will remain vigilant and re-evaluate the situation if required,‚Äù said Richardson.

‚ÄúWe are optimistic that this will be the next step in a steady and safe return of international cricket to Pakistan.‚Äù

Captain of the World XI team Faf du Plessis of South Africa said that he is looking forward to play in Lahore.

‚ÄúLike most of the players, I look forward to my maiden tour to Lahore and play my part in the safe and gradual resumption of international cricket in Pakistan,‚Äù said du Plessis.

‚ÄúAll the members of the squad have complete faith and trust in the assessment and judgement of the security experts, who have assured us that there will be no comprise on the safety and security of all those involved in the series.

‚ÄúAs professionals, we are getting paid to play in the series, but the bottom-line is that if we did not feel safe, no amount of money would get us there. In this background, we will land in Lahore with nothing except cricket in our minds.‚Äù

Shuttling for nectar: A rags-to-riches ‚ÄòBee-School‚Äô success story,"Pardeep Kumar (right) with his bee nest boxes in Badal village of Punjab‚Äôs Muktsar district. (Source: Express Photo/Raakhi Jagga) Pardeep Kumar (right) with his bee nest boxes in Badal village of Punjab‚Äôs Muktsar district. (Source: Express Photo/Raakhi Jagga)

PARDEEP KUMAR was only 14 in 2000, when his mother Usha Rani gave him Rs 30,000 to take up beekeeping. He started by purchasing eight honeybee nest boxes and, over the next five years, increased the number to over 100. Today, this resident of Badal ‚Äî a village in Lambi tehsil of Muktsar district from where Punjab‚Äôs former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal also hails ‚Äî has 3,800 hive boxes. And these are placed to attract bee swarms in different parts of not just Punjab, but even Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and as far as Jharkhand.

‚ÄúI keep shuttling from state to state, depending upon a particular crop‚Äôs flowering season (that is when the tiny-winged insects collect nectar, while also transporting pollen from one flower to another). I have 30 employees who come with me to various places and stay on there to collect the honey made by the bees. I am myself travelling for about 12-15 days of the month,‚Äù says Kumar.

Kumar supplies about 95 per cent of the honey harvested from his colonies to units in processing-cum-export centres such Doraha (Ludhiana district) and Lalru (Mohali). The remaining 5 per cent he sells under his own ‚ÄòDeep Honey‚Äô brand through two outlets ‚Äî one in Badal village and the other at the Bathinda district administrative complex.

Pardeep Kumar‚Äôs story is interesting because he is a progressive farmer coming from a landless family. Also, he was just five when his father, a single-truck owner, died. ‚ÄúI was forced to sell the truck in order to marry off my daughter. My son, too, had to give up studies after completing class X. All I could do was to help him by giving Rs 30,000 from my accumulated savings,‚Äù recalls Kumar‚Äôs mother Usha Rani, who drew a modest salary as a worker at the local Anganwadi (child care) centre.

Kumar learnt about beekeeping initially from Buta Singh, a farmer from Badal. In 2002, he underwent formal training in apiculture from the Krishi Vigyan Kendra at Bathinda. In 2011, he took advanced training from the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana for rearing of queen bees. These are the females that turn out to be the mothers of most, if not all, bees in individual hives or colonies.

‚ÄúIn a normal colony, it takes roughly 21 days for a queen bee to develop from egg stage and be capable of mating. But by raising them in special dummy boxes, I could now supply these adult, ready-to-be-mated females to farmers,‚Äù notes Kumar, who, by 2012, was also making nest boxes. ‚ÄúI started supplying these boxes along with the queen bees to other farmers. Currently, I sell 400-500 beehive boxes every year, costing around Rs 2,000 each if empty and Rs 4,000 with bees. If a farmer also wants a ready-for-mating queen bee, I charge extra Rs 350,‚Äù he adds.

Kumar, in the process, has emerged as a complete bee-entrepreneur; he is even sought after as a trainer to farmers attending beekeeping courses, including those organised by state agriculture and horticulture departments. Besides, his outlets have also begun stocking non-honey food products such as pickles, chutneys, murabbas (sweet fruit preserves), papads and sauces, made by 20-odd village women organised into a self-help group. Kumar‚Äôs wife takes care of this operation. ‚ÄúWe pay the women as and when they supply to our outlets. Marketing their products is entirely our job,‚Äù he states. Pardeep Kumar takes pride in two things. The first is from showing that one can be a progressive farmer even without owning any land.

‚ÄúI often hear people say that the farm sector is in distress and agriculture is a losing proposition. My answer to that is this needn‚Äôt be so if a farmer is prepared to do new things and upgrade his knowledge on a continuous basis. I started beekeeping in 2000 as a teenager. Only in 2011, did I come to know that the Punjab government extends a 40 per cent subsidy for apiculture. While I did avail of the scheme‚Äôs benefits ‚Äì by supplying nest boxes to the horticulture department, which further gives them on subsidy to other beekeepers ‚Äì the fact is that my success owes itself not to subsidy or ownership of land, but hard work and willingness to learn,‚Äù he claims.

The second source of his pride is from becoming not merely an earner, but also an employer. ‚ÄúI feel happy as someone providing employment to 30 men and also supporting 20 rural women through their self-help group. If I have set an example for others to also take up beekeeping, that‚Äôs an added bonus,‚Äù he points out. Kumar‚Äôs latest passion is organic farming. Only recently, he purchased 2.5 acres of land at Kheowali, a village not too far from Badal. ‚ÄúI am experimenting with organic vegetables and cotton cultivation without use of any pesticides. The initial results are promising, but replicating honey‚Äôs success will take time,‚Äù he signs off.

Out on several LIMBS,"Representational Image Representational Image

Earlier this year, the Union Minister of Law and Justice wrote a letter to other Union ministers and chief ministers of states. ‚ÄúAs you are aware that government is a major litigant and it is a party to about 46 per cent of the 3.14 crore cases pending in various courts in the country, ranging from service matters to indirect taxes. The government must cease to be a compulsive litigant, and executive power should be made use to reduce the grievance of the future litigant.‚Äù

Although the share depends on the level of the court (Supreme Court, high courts, lower courts), in aggregate, two-thirds of the cases are criminal. A crime is committed against society. Therefore, by definition, the government will be a party in criminal cases, depending on how government is defined. With this lens, 46 per cent is low ‚Äî it cannot refer to all cases. It must mean civil cases. I doubt robust data exists to substantiate the figure. It is probably a guess, though it figures in the Department of Justice‚Äôs June 2017 Action Plan to reduce government litigation.

But one can live with the guess that half of civil litigation involves the government, as petitioner or respondent. That‚Äôs high and the government‚Äôs proclivity to litigate crowds private citizens out from accessing justice. At least two of the PM‚Äôs speeches mentioned this undesirable trait. The first was on October 31, 2016, at the 50th anniversary of the Delhi High Court and the second on January 20, 2017, when the actual theme was tourism. In the first, he referred to the government as a litigant. In the second, he mentioned the phenomenon of two government departments litigating against each other.

After consultations in 2009, there was a National Litigation Policy (NLP) in 2010. This started with a laudable promise: ‚ÄúThe National Litigation Policy is based on the recognition that Government and its various agencies are the pre-dominant litigants in courts and Tribunals in the country. Its aim is to transform Government into an Efficient and Responsible litigant.‚Äù NLP had a lot of laudable statements and there was nothing to disagree with. There were platitudes in plenty, but nothing to pin down. There has been talk of a new version of the NLP. If this is old wine in an old bottle, it‚Äôs not worth it.

To be specific, let me cite Order 27, Rule 5B from the CPC (Civil Procedure Code). ‚Äú(1) In every suit or proceeding to which the government, or a public officer acting in his official capacity, is a party, it shall be the duty of the court to make, in the first instance, every endeavour, where it is possible to do so consistently with the nature and circumstances of the case, to assist the parties in arriving at a settlement in respect of the subject matter of the suit. (2) If in any such suit or proceedings, at any stage, it appears to the court that there is a reasonable possibility of a settlement between the parties, the court may adjourn the proceeding for such period as it thinks fit, to enable attempts to be made to effect such a settlement.‚Äù This also applies to situations where government is litigating on both sides. Mandatory invoking of this is specific, not vague. However, unless done through executive action, courts can‚Äôt do much.

There are specifics that go back to Law Commission‚Äôs 126th report (1988) on a litigation policy and strategies for the government and PSUs. ‚ÄúTo illustrate, an officer having been satisfied that the claim against the Government or the public sector undertaking, is genuine, yet, to avoid taking an affirmative decision by a policy of do nothingness, the litigation is invited. Once the court intervenes, it is assumed that the concerned Department or the undertaking should not take any decision and leave it to the court to adjudicate the claim. The indifference arising out of a lack of social audit encourages such (an) officer to prefer an appeal if the decision is adverse and by vertical movement, the matter generally reaches the apex court.‚Äù

I am surprised Law Commission‚Äôs report didn‚Äôt mention Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA). A clause in this guarantees risk-aversion. Add to that the inability of the government to pin down responsibility for decision-making and variance between the government‚Äôs perceived costs (not just monetary) of litigation and social costs. Obviously, litigation policy (LP) also has to do with states. Following 2010, all states have LPs. But most are like long playing records, with motherhood statements. A specific LIMBS (Legal Information Management & Briefing System) is better than a vague LP. LIMBS is in its infancy. Therefore, data are imperfect. Nevertheless, one has data (which will improve) to track Union government ministries/departments. As of June 2017, in the LIMBs database, there are 1,35,060 government cases pending, with 369 contempt cases. Railways has the most and Panchayati Raj the least.

In some ministries/departments, there are several cases more than 10 years old. To state the obvious, there must be better ways of resolving service-related disputes. In the June 2017 document, the Department of Justice proposed an online platform with, progressively, mediation and neutral third-party arbitration. Naturally, service-related matters are somewhat different from tax litigation the Central Board of Direct Taxes or Central Board of Excise and Customs confront. In December 1991, the Cabinet Secretariat set up what later came to be called a Committee on Disputes. The intention was the prevention of government litigating against government, without it being first examined by the committee. This committee was later scrapped because it only added layers, without resolving anything. However, that 1991 intention now finds some traction in 2017.

US Navy to launch fleet-wide probe as search for 10 missing sailors goes on,"The collision tore a hole in the warship‚Äôs port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area. (AP) The collision tore a hole in the warship‚Äôs port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area. (AP)

Ships, aircraft and divers from an international search-and-rescue operation were still looking for 10 missing US sailors on Tuesday after a collision between a US warship and a merchant vessel in waters near Singapore and Malaysia.

The USS John S. McCain and the tanker Alnic MC collided early on Monday while the guided-missile destroyer was nearing Singapore for a routine port call. The collision tore a hole in the warship‚Äôs port side at the waterline, flooding compartments that included a crew sleeping area.

The collision ‚Äì the fourth major accident in the US Pacific fleet this year ‚Äì prompted a fleet-wide investigation and plans for temporary halts in operations to focus on safety. The US Navy said in a statement late on Monday that aircraft from the amphibious assault ship the USS America, which was in port at Singapore‚Äôs Changi Naval Base, would continue searching for the missing sailors. They join aircraft and vessels from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia already searching in the area.

Damage control efforts on board the USS John S. McCain were focused on draining water from the ship and restoring auxiliary systems, and divers had started assessing the warship‚Äôs damaged hull, the statement said. A public affairs officer for the US Seventh Fleet told Reuters the USS John McCain remained pierside at Changi Naval Base and that a repair plan would be put in place after assessments were complete. Admiral Scott Swift, who serves as the Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, was in Kuala Lumpur on Monday and was scheduled to arrive in Singapore on Tuesday.

Singapore‚Äôs Maritime and Port Authority said search efforts had continued through the night. Video footage and still pictures showed that a wide hole was ripped in the John S. McCain‚Äôs aft port side. Five sailors were also injured in the accident, although the US Navy said none of those injuries was life-threatening.

On Monday, US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said there were no indications so far the collision was intentional or the result of cyber intrusion or sabotage. ‚ÄúBut review will consider all possibilities,‚Äù he said on Twitter.

Richardson said he was asking his fleet commanders worldwide for a one-to-two-day, staggered ‚Äúoperational pause‚Äù to discuss action to ensure safe and effective operations. He envisaged this could begin within a week. He also said a comprehensive review would examine the training of US forces deployed to Japan ‚Äúto make sure we are doing everything we can to make them ready for operations and warfighting‚Äù. The US Seventh Fleet is headquartered in Japan. This would include looking at ‚Äúoperational tempo, trends in personnel, materiel, maintenance and equipment,‚Äù Richardson said.

"Dabholkar, Pansare murders not stray incidents: Bombay HC","Dr Narendra Dabholkar. File Dr Narendra Dabholkar. File

The murders of rationalists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare were not ‚Äústray incidents‚Äù and the accused seem to have ‚Äúorganisational back-up,‚Äù the Bombay High Court said on Wednesday. The court also pointed out the need for making more concerted efforts to trace the absconding accused. The bench also said there was a ‚Äúclear nexus‚Äù between the two killings. ‚ÄúIt is impossible for the absconding accused to remain in hiding for so long at an individual level. These are not stray acts. The accused cannot be absconding for so long without organisational back-up. Look into where they are getting funding from,‚Äù said Justice S C Dharmadhikari, emphasising that the ‚Äúsecurity of the state was at stake here‚Äù.

A division bench, comprising Justice S C Dharmadhikari and Justice Vibha Kankanvadi, was hearing petitions by the family members who expressed dissatisfaction with the CBI probe into Dabholkar‚Äôs case and SIT investigation into Pansare‚Äôs murder. They had urged the High Court to step in and monitor the probe. Dabholkar was murdered on August 20, 2013, in Pune while Pansare was shot at on February 16 in Kolhapur and died on February 20, 2015.

The HC observations on Wednesday came after the Special Task Force (STF) and the CBI submitted their probe reports. The CBI‚Äôs Special Crime Branch (SCB) had recently announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh for anyone who provided information about Sanatan Sanstha members Sarang Akolkar (35) and Vinay Baburao Pawar (37), both accused in the murder of Dabholkar.

Appearing as special counsel for the government, senior advocate Ashok Mundargi agreed with the court‚Äôs remark on the absconding accused having some backing, adding that this angle was being explored by the investigating agency. The matter is posted for hearing on September 13.

"Kidnap and murder of girl in Nagpada: ‚Äô17-year-old will be tried in children‚Äôs court‚Äô, says Juvenile Justice Board","Under the 2015 Act, the Board can transfer cases pertaining to children in conflict with law between the age groups 16-18 years in heinous offences that attract punishment of over seven years imprisonment. (Representational Image) Under the 2015 Act, the Board can transfer cases pertaining to children in conflict with law between the age groups 16-18 years in heinous offences that attract punishment of over seven years imprisonment. (Representational Image)

One of the two teenagers booked for allegedly kidnapping and murdering a three-and-a-half-year-old girl in Nagpada will be tried before the children‚Äôs court, the Juvenile Justice Board has said. In an order passed by the Mumbai city Juvenile Justice Board on Tuesday, it stated that the case of the older of the boys, the 17-year-old, will be transferred to the children‚Äôs court in the sessions court under the new Juvenile Justice Act, 2015. The case of the younger of the two boys, a 16-year-old, continues to be tried before the Board.

Under the 2015 Act, the Board can transfer cases pertaining to children in conflict with law between the age groups 16-18 years in heinous offences that attract punishment of over seven years imprisonment.

On December 5, 2016, the victim, a neighbour of the 17-year-old, had gone missing from her home in Nagpada. The JJ Marg police claimed that the 17-year-old boy had kidnapped the girl for ransom and then killed her after he panicked. The police claimed that the 17-year-old had then called the 16-year-old and they had hidden the body atop a neighbouring building.

The police nabbed the boys when they allegedly made a ransom call days after the murder. In March, the Board had directed that the boys be made to undergo a preliminary assessment under the 2015 Act. The assessment is with regard to the mental and physical capacity of children in conflict with law to commit the offence, their ability to understand the consequences of the offence committed by them and the circumstances in which the offences were allegedly committed.

If the children‚Äôs court finds the child guilty, he can be, on turning 21, awarded a maximum of 10 years in jail. If tried before the Board, the child can be sentenced to a maximum of three years in a reformative home.

VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: This Dhanush-Kajol film suffers due to a hopelessly stilted plot,"VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: Kajol is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings. VIP 2 Lalkar movie review: Kajol is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings.

VIP 2 Lalkar movie cast: Dhanush, Kajol, Amala Paul

VIP 2 Lalkar movie director: Soundarya Rajinikanth

VIP 2 Lalkar movie star rating: 1.5

The only reason to keep watching this film right till the bitter end comes right at the end. This is not a spoiler. It‚Äôs just a tip, which comes to you via gritted teeth, because you keep asking yourself in disbelief, just how bad can a Dhanush film get?

Going by VIP 2, let me tell you, it can get pretty terrible.

VIP 2 Lalkar is 99 percent tosh, created for the express purpose of getting Dhanush to sing and dance and ‚Äòdo comedy‚Äô and fight, all the things a Hero is meant to do.

Given that the leading man is capable of terrific acting, and has done all kinds of interesting, edgy roles, this one should have been a snip. But he flubs it, essentially because of a hopelessly stilted plot and treatment that is all clich√©.

Taking off from where the original VIP left off, we see Raghuvaran (Dhanush) crossing swords with the very toffee-nosed Vasundhara (Kajol), the former being the very proletarian, down-to-earth engineer and the savior of many working class young joes like himself, the latter being the very wealthy, arrogant owner of the biggest architect firm in the region.

‚ÄòVellai‚Äô (work) plus ‚Äòillai‚Äô (no) adds up to Jobless Raghuvaran, whose fight against Vasundhara is on the principles of fairness and justice and truth and saving the environment. That must have sounded good on paper, but is executed so ham-handedly, that you cringe.

And Kajol, who was so good in her big Tamil outing many years ago (Rajeev Menon‚Äôs Minsara Kanuvu aka Sapnay, ‚Äò97) is all snarly and slit-eyed and power-suited here, snapping fingers at her underlings. She‚Äôs written with no variation, and you watch in despair: Kajol has much more in her; she certainly doesn‚Äôt need this. And we are expected to believe that Dhanush, the slender, lightweight Dhanush, can take on burly villains single-handedly, and send them flying, slo-mo.

All you can is to roll your eyes.

And one more thing. Given that there is a female director at the helm, it has surprisingly regressive lines, poking fun at wives and other women. These jokes have gone old, and more so in a film helmed by the next gen.

In the last few minutes, the film changes tack, loosens up, allowing the two leads to break out. Suddenly, we find the two talking to each other, measuring each other up for size, showing us two actors at work.

This could have been the film.

"Arjuna award devalued, made cheap: Past recipients","The Sports Ministry on Tuesday confirmed the names of the Arjuna awardees for this year but many have question the ‚Äúdignity‚Äù of the award as the government is ‚Äúthrowing‚Äù the awards away. Former Arjuna awardees including former captain of Indian hockey team Ashok Kumar and middle-distance runner Sriram Singh Shekhawat raised their voices against it.

‚ÄúThe dignity has to be maintained. Why do you need to give Arjuna every year. Is it necessary? We are now throwing the awards away,‚Äù Ashok told PTI. ‚ÄúThey (government) have set their own parameters. The value attached with the award should be increased. There should be a cap that only Asiad and Olympic medal winners should be selected for the Arjuna honour,‚Äù Ashok, son of the legendary hockey player Dhyanchand, said.

The 1975 World Cup winner and recipient of the Arjuna award in 1974 also questioned the process by which the awards are been given.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt beg for award or demand it. Why should I blow my own trumpet that I have achieved something. When someone goes out for competition, it happens with the permission of the government. They know the achievements so it should be the government which should pick athletes rather than players sending applications,‚Äù he said.

The awards will be conferred to the winners on August 29 ‚Äî National Sports Day. Indian squash player Saurabh Ghosal also said that the process should be reconsidered.

‚ÄúI think the concept of recommending or nominating someone for the awards is flawed. It just doesn‚Äôt sound right that player needs to be recommended or needs to apply for the award. The committee should pick the winners on their own on the basis of performances. Applying for the awards is like asking for a grant,‚Äù the 2006 Arjuna awardee said.

Shekhawat, who holds the national record in men‚Äôs 800m since 1976, said that there was a tough fight for the award back in his days.

‚ÄúWhen Arjuna awards were decided for year 1972, I was Asiad medallist but still did not get it. There was only one slot and the award was given to V S Chauhan. We both were national record holders but since he was senior to me, he was chosen,‚Äù Shekhawat said. ‚ÄúThe selected athletes should be a medal winner at least at the Asian Games level,‚Äù he suggested.

Echoing the same words, former captain of the Indian volleyball team Suresh Mishra said that there should be so many awards.

‚ÄúWhich name is bigger, Arjuna or Rajiv Gandhi. It‚Äôs an insult to Arjuna award. It has been degraded,‚Äù he said about the award which was constituted in 1972.

Amid all this, Zafar Iqbal, former captain of Indian hockey team, said that awards help encourage athletes.

‚ÄúThe award is not only for the athletes but also for the masses who follow. It encourages everyone. It has been fair. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs devalued,‚Äù the 1979 Arjuna awardee said.

India A skipper Karun Nair led his side to a six-wicket win over South Africa A to level the two-matches series 1-1. Nair scored 90 runs as India A chased down a target of 224 runs at Senwes Park, Potchefstroom on the last day of the second unofficial four-day match.

Chasing the target, India lost Sudip Chatterjee for 18 after he was bowled by Dane Piedt. Shreyas Iyer too went back without making a substantial contribution as he was out caught and bowled by Shaun von Berg for 15.

After being reduced to 55/2, opener Ravikumar Samarth and skipper Nair stitched a partnership of 74 runs for the third wicket. Samarth continued his good form to score another half-century in the match. The right-hander was eventually undone by Piedt for 55.

Nair on the other side continued with his batting display and scored 93 runs for the fourth wicket with Ankit Bawne.

He was eventually out for 90 by Andile Phehlukwayo while Bawne remained unbeaten for 32. Hanuman Vihari, who replaced the captain in the middle, scored the winning runs after hitting a boundary off the only delivery he faced.

For South Africa it was Piedt who picked up two wickets while von Berg and Phehlukwayo scalped a wicket apiece.

"Doklam standoff: Avoid unnecessary travel within India, China tells its citizens; top developments","Doklam standoff: The Sikkim section has a special historical background and this is the only defined boundary between China and India, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang Doklam standoff: The Sikkim section has a special historical background and this is the only defined boundary between China and India, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang

As the nearly two-month long standoff at Doklam plateau in Sikkim sector between Indian and Chinese troops continues, Beijing on Thursday issued a second safety advisory to its nationals travelling to India as it sought to highlight train accidents, natural disasters, and frequent outbreak of diseases in the country. This development comes amid a shrill propaganda campaign launched by China against India in the face of Doklam standoff. Over the last two months, the Chinese media has vigorously protested the Indian resistance to its attempt to transform the character of the territory in Doklam. In August alone, some 125 articles have been written on the Indian ‚Äútrespass‚Äù, ‚Äúhijacking a small neighbour‚Äù, and a so-called Bhutanese acknowledgement to China that Doklam actually belongs to China.

Here are the top developments in the Doklam standoff:

1. The advisory asks Chinese nationals to pay attention to their personal safety and the local security situation and to avoid unnecessary travel within the country, state-run People‚Äôs Daily Online reported.

2. As per the advisory, Chinese nationals are told to carry personal identification, obey religious customs, and keep their family, colleagues, and friends posted about their travel.

3. The warning is valid till the end of the year. The first safety advisory was issued by China on July 7 and was valid for one month.

4. Yesterday, the Union Home Ministry had asked the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) to construct the stand-alone road from Marsimik La to Hot Spring in Ladakh to ensure access to ‚Äúvantage points‚Äù for security forces. As first reported by The Indian Express (on July 27, 2017), the home ministry had last month cleared the proposal to construct the road at a cost of Rs 120.58 crore.

5. A home ministry spokesperson said, ‚ÄúThe task to construct the road has been given to BRO and they have started mobilisation of resources.‚Äù The 32.9-km standalone road from Marsimik La to Hot Spring in Ladakh will give security forces access to remote areas to the east of Ladakh region, which has earlier witnessed aggression from Chinese forces, officials said.

6. China on Tuesday said the only way to end the Doklam standoff in Sikkim sector was for India to unconditionally withdraw its troops from the area. Beijing‚Äôs response comes a day after Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh expressed hope that China would soon make a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù move in this regard.

7. Rajnath Singh had on Monday expressed hope that a solution to the Doklam standoff would be found soon and said India never attacked a nation nor did it harbour any expansionist behaviour.

8. Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in a stand-off in the Doklam area of the Sikkim sector for seven weeks now after Indian troops stopped the Chinese army from building a road in the disputed area. China claimed that they were constructing the road within their territory and has been demanding immediate pull-out of the Indian troops from the disputed Doklam plateau. New Delhi has expressed concern over the road building, apprehending that it may allow Chinese troops to cut India‚Äôs access to its northeastern states.

9. India has conveyed to the Chinese government that the road construction would represent a significant change of status quo with serious security implications for it. Doka La is the Indian name for the region which Bhutan recognises as Doklam, while China claims it as part of its Donglang region.

10. Of the 3,488-km-long India-China border from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh, a 220-km section falls in Sikkim. China also claims that Thimphu has no dispute with Beijing over Doklam.

Spanish police identify remains of last terror cell suspect,"Police said on Thursday they had identified the remains of the last suspected member of a cell which carried out terror attacks in northeastern Spain. ‚ÄúYoussef Aalla is the last corpse identified in the Alcanar explosion,‚Äù Catalan regional police said, referring to an accidental blast at the jihadists‚Äô bomb factory on the eve of the August 17 assault in Barcelona.

‚ÄúThat is the last known member of the cell‚Äù whose remains had not been formally identified, they said. The explosion also killed an imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, who is believed to have radicalised the young men in the cell. It was so strong that ‚Äúthe mushroom cloud that was generated was visible several kilometres (miles) around,‚Äù according to court documents.

The blast forced the suspects to turn instead to using vehicles as weapons. They ran down people in a crowded avenue in Barcelona on August 17, and in the nearby seaside town of Cambrils in the early hours of the following day. Fifteen people were killed and more than 120 injured.

Aalla is one of three brothers caught up in the case. Said Aalla, 18 was shot dead by police in Cambrils as he and four others ran pedestrians down with a car. Their older brother, Mohammed, 27, was detained initially by police but was granted conditional release on Tuesday as the judge deemed evidence against him too weak.

His Audi A3 was used in the Cambrils attack, but he has told the court that it was registered under his name for insurance purposes. The car, he said, was used by his brother, Said.

US State Department‚Äôs science envoy resigns over Trump‚Äôs response on Charlottesville violence,"Daniel Kammen. (Source ‚Äì Twitter) Daniel Kammen. (Source ‚Äì Twitter)

One of the U.S. State Department‚Äôs science envoys publicly resigned on Wednesday, the latest in a wave of defections over President Donald Trump‚Äôs response to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Daniel Kammen, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a letter posted on his Twitter account that Trump had failed to condemn white supremacists and neo-Nazis, part of ‚Äúa broader pattern of behavior that enables sexism and racism, and disregards the welfare of all Americans, the global community and the planet.‚Äù

Trump told reporters last week that ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù were to blame for the violence between white supremacists and counter protesters in Virginia on Aug. 12, and said there were ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù among those who participated in the white nationalist rally. At a rally in Arizona on Tuesday, Trump defended his response and said the news media had ignored his condemnation of white supremacists.

Envoys serve as unpaid volunteers and engage with government and non-government science officials and convene meetings around foreign policy and science.

In his letter, Kammen also criticized Trump‚Äôs decision to leave the Paris Climate Accord. The first letters of each paragraph in his letter spelled out the word ‚Äúimpeach‚Äù.

Kammen, the White House and the State Department did not respond to requests for comment. The science envoy position is not particularly high-profile. The envoys ‚Äì drawn from the ranks of American scientists and scholars ‚Äì typically serve for one year, so Kammen was likely nearing the end of his term. According to his LinkedIn profile, Kammen served as an envoy since August 2016.

Two of the other six envoys listed on an archived State Department website as being in Kammen‚Äôs cohort told Reuters their terms had ended prior to Trump taking office.

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, served as envoy in 2015 and 2016 and said he has been in contact with the State Department about possibly returning. He would be willing to do so even after Trump‚Äôs post-Charlottesville statements, he told Reuters on Wednesday.

‚ÄúDespite those comments I think it‚Äôs important to be willing to serve the United States,‚Äù Hotez said.

Trump‚Äôs comments in response to the protests sparked a wave of defections of American chief executives last week from White House advisory councils, leading to their disbanding, and earned condemnations from Republicans and Democrats alike.

New Trump Afghan policy expected to ramp up pressure on Pak,"President Trump will outline the policy in a televised speech ‚Äì only the second of his time in office ‚Äì from Fort Myers Base in Virginia to an audience of soldiers and their families. President Trump will outline the policy in a televised speech ‚Äì only the second of his time in office ‚Äì from Fort Myers Base in Virginia to an audience of soldiers and their families.

United States President Donald Trump‚Äôs new policy on the war in Afghanistan, scheduled to be announced late on Monday night, is likely to include a series of measures designed to coerce Pakistan‚Äôs military and intelligence services to abandon their support of the Taliban and its affiliated jihadist networks, two separate Washington DC-based government sources have told The Indian Express.

Few operational details of the new strategy are expected to be spelt out in the speech, but the sources said the President could signal his willingness to destroy jihadist infrastructure beyond Afghanistan‚Äôs borders ‚Äì in practice, by escalating drone strikes in Pakistan‚Äôs north-west, as well as special forces raids.

President Trump will outline the policy in a televised speech ‚Äì only the second of his time in office ‚Äì from Fort Myers Base in Virginia to an audience of soldiers and their families.

His speech is also expected to announce a modest increase in troop numbers, and reaffirm its financial commitment to the Afghan military‚Äôs counter-terrorism campaign.

The speech is being watched closely by Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs national security advisors, who have been telling the United States that the fall of the Afghan government will destabilise south and central Asia.

President Trump‚Äôs decision was made at a Friday meeting on Afghanistan, where the hard line counselled by his National Security Advisor, Lieutenant-General Herbert McMaster, prevailed over more cautious voices, the sources said. A veteran of the Afghanistan war, McMaster has long argued that the Taliban cannot be defeated unless Taliban infrastructure inside Pakistan is shut down.

Following a meeting with Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa in April, McMaster publicly chastised the country‚Äôs leaders, saying that ‚Äúthe best way to pursue their interests in Afghanistan and elsewhere is through diplomacy, not through the use of proxies that engage in violence‚Äù.

Lisa Curtis, Senior Director for South and Central Asia at the National Security Council, was among those who backed McMaster on Friday, the sources said, arguing that punitive elements were needed to change Pakistan‚Äôs policies on Afghanistan, a source familiar with the discussions said.

Early in August, Curtis had met with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar, on a low-profile visit to New Delhi, for talks on regional security issues.

The meeting on Friday, the sources said, saw Defence Secretary Jim Mattis lead discussions, presenting President Trump with a series of options, ranging from the status quo, to plans for an extended, aggressive commitment in Afghanistan. Plans for imposing a variety of sanctions to punish Pakistan for supporting the Taliban, and rewards for its cooperation, were also discussed in detail.

‚ÄúI am very comfortable that the strategic process was sufficiently rigorous,‚Äù Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said en route to Jordan, where he is scheduled to meet with the country‚Äôs King Abdullah.

Friday‚Äôs meeting was preceded by a palace coup which saw the exit of President Trump‚Äôs chief strategist, Steve Bannon, a controversial far-right figure who had argued against further commitment to the war in Afghanistan. Trump‚Äôs son-in-law and key advisor Jared Kushner was also absent, in a sign the President had chosen to lean on processional military and intelligence advice.

President Trump had earlier been expected to provide strategic directions on Afghan policy to the commander of United States forces in Afghanistan, Gen John Nicholson, by mid-July. Instead, on July 19, the President reportedly sought to sack General Nicholson, demanding to know why the 16-year-old war had not been won, and sought ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù ideas from his staff.

In its most recent report to the United States Congress, the Special Inspector-General for Afghan Reconstruction reported that the Taliban and its affiliate now control 11 districts and influence 34 of Afghanistan‚Äôs 407 districts, or some 11% of the country‚Äôs territory, while the Afghan government controls 97 districts and influences 146 districts, some 60% of the country‚Äôs territory.

Helped by a string of rural bases stretching from Helmand, Kandahar, Uruzgan, Zabul and Ghazni, the Taliban are increasingly able to threaten provincial capitals ‚Äì even though jihadists remain unable to hold them for sustained lengths of time.

Though the war is described by most experts as having reached a level of stalemate, Afghan National Security Advisor Hanif Atmar said the country‚Äôs military was losing 29 soldiers a day in combat ‚Äì levels most experts concur are unsustainable in the long run.

White House renews request for privacy for Trump‚Äôs young son Barron,"President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, and their son and Barron Trump, walk to Marine One. (Source: AP Photo) President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, and their son and Barron Trump, walk to Marine One. (Source: AP Photo)

The White House on Tuesday renewed its request to the news media for privacy for President Donald Trump‚Äôs young son, Barron, after a conservative news and opinion website criticized the casual attire he wore home after the family‚Äôs summer vacation. The 11-year-old wore shorts, a T-shirt that said ‚ÄúOn Your Mark Tiger Shark‚Äù and loafers without socks for Sunday‚Äôs return trip to the White House from the family‚Äôs home on Trump‚Äôs private golf club in central New Jersey. Trump wore a suit and tie while Barron‚Äôs mother, first lady Melania Trump, wore a sleeveless, calf-length yellow-and-white dress. Ford Springer, The Daily Caller columnist, wrote that since Barron doesn‚Äôt have any responsibilities as the president‚Äôs son ‚Äúthe least he could do is dress the part when he steps out in public.‚Äù

‚ÄúBarron was returning to the White House from New Jersey on Sunday and while the president and first lady traveled in their Sunday best, young Barron looked like he was hopping on Air Force One for a trip to the movie theater,‚Äù the column said. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump, appealed to the media to give Barron space to be a kid. ‚ÄúAs with all previous administrations, we ask that the media give Barron his privacy. He is a minor child and deserves every opportunity to have a private childhood,‚Äù Grisham said. Vince Coglianese, editorial director for The Daily Caller, defended Springer. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not pretend the press is suddenly concerned about defending the Trumps,‚Äù Coglianese said by email, describing Springer as the ‚Äúthe most pro-Barron Trump writer I‚Äôve ever met.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave it to the fake news to spin his bro-to-bro advice into some sort of ‚Äòslam.‚Äô He‚Äôs just looking out for the kid. Leave Barron alone,‚Äù Coglianese said. The White House also got bipartisan support from former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, who defended Barron on Twitter. Clinton was the subject of ridicule as a teenager growing up in the White House in the 1990s when her father, Democrat Bill Clinton, was president. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs high time the media & everyone leave Barron Trump alone & let him have the private childhood he deserves,‚Äù Clinton tweeted Monday, with a link to the Daily Caller column. She followed up on Tuesday after a Twitter user criticized Barron‚Äôs entire family in unpublishable terms.

‚ÄúBarron is A KID. No child should be talked about in the below manner-in real life or online. And for an adult to do so? For shame,‚Äù she tweeted back to the individual, who uses the Twitter handle (at)MattyRenn. Late Tuesday, the first lady tweeted her thanks to Clinton, saying ‚Äúso important to support all of our children in being themselves! (hash)StopChildhoodBullying.‚Äù The hashtag was a reference to her promise to work as first lady to combat cyberbullying.

In response to The Associated Press through Twitter, (at)MattyRenn said the White House doesn‚Äôt have the right to dictate who cannot be insulted ‚Äúgiven the very real threats faced on a daily basis by all Americans to the antagonistic foreign policy of this president.‚Äù Earlier this year, Clinton defended Barron after he was the target of a joke by a ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù writer. The writer was later suspended.

AB de Villiers steps down as South Africa ODI captain,"AB de Villiers stepped down as South Africa ODI captain. (Source: Reuters) AB de Villiers stepped down as South Africa ODI captain. (Source: Reuters)

AB de Villiers has stepped down as the skipper of the ODI team but will be available for selection across all formats of the game. In a video posted on his official Twitter account, de Villiers said, ‚ÄúA lot has been said and written over the past 12 months, and I feel it is time to make my position absolutely clear. Over the past year or so, I have tried to manage many commitments. I have felt mentally and physically tired; my wife and I are bringing up two fantastic kids and playing in all three formats ever since 2004 has taken its toll.‚Äù

‚ÄúTogether with Cricket South Africa, we have tried to develop a viable schedule which allows me to prolong my career for as long as possible. This strategy has prompted some people to say I am picking and choosing when to play for the Proteas, and even to suggest I am somehow putting myself before the team. That is simply not true. That has never been true. Playing for South Africa is, and will always be, the greatest privilege of my life,‚Äù he added.

Looking forward to a great summer #ProteaFire pic.twitter.com/yojybIrvjZ ‚Äî AB de Villiers (@ABdeVilliers17) 23 August 2017

The right-hander last played for South Africa in a T20I in June 2017 while made an appearance in an ODI earlier in the same month. ‚ÄúFollowing this recent break, I really do feel refreshed and revived,‚Äù de Villiers said.

Talking about making a comeback the South African suggested that he is eager to get back on the field. ‚ÄúI want to get back on the field and I have today assured the national selectors that I will be available for selection in all three formats of the game during the coming season. ‚ÄúThere is plenty of hard work ahead in the nets and I must prepare properly, but I will be ready to play, if required, from the middle of October onwards.‚Äù

Hailing, Faf du Plessis‚Äô captaincy abilities, de Villiers praised his teammate and further went on to say that he has been an outstanding skipper.

‚ÄúFaf du Plessis has proved to be an outstanding captain of the T20 and Test teams, and bearing this in mind, I have informed Cricket South Africa that I would like to step down as captain of the ODI team,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIt has been an honour to lead the team for the past six years, but it is now time for someone else to take the ODI side forward. Whoever is chosen as the new ODI captain will have my complete support,‚Äù he added.

"Debt resolution top priority in insolvency process, says IBBI chief","The government‚Äôs effort is also to empower the market participants in every field and that is what has been the focus of the insolvency code where one gets not just the freedom to enter into a business, but also enjoys the freedom to exit the business. The government‚Äôs effort is also to empower the market participants in every field and that is what has been the focus of the insolvency code where one gets not just the freedom to enter into a business, but also enjoys the freedom to exit the business.

Resolution of indebtedness of a firm will be the top priority of all constituents of the insolvency and bankruptcy mechanism in the interest of the stakeholders, and it will think about liquidation only if it finds that the resolution is hard to come by, Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) chairperson MS Sahoo said on Wednesday.

‚ÄúIn such a process, the first endeavour is resolution. If it is not resoluble then they think about liquidation. The endeavour of the law, insolvency professionals and committee of creditors is to first find out a resolution plan,‚Äù Sahoo said while speaking at a conference organised by PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The IBBI chief said as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), resolution is left with the imagination of the market participants and they are free to take any call in regards to an entity, which is down with indebtedness. The government is just trying to create an enabling environment.

The government‚Äôs effort is also to empower the market participants in every field and that is what has been the focus of the insolvency code where one gets not just the freedom to enter into a business, but also enjoys the freedom to exit the business.

‚ÄúIn our scheme of things, we have segregated the role of the state and the role of the market. We have also segregated commercial aspects from judicial aspects. Bankruptcy code says that insolvency professionals will run the company; but for a resolution, the decision of resolution will be taken by the market, that is the committee of creditors,‚Äù he said.

Sahoo also pitched for a market driven institutional mechanism to facilitate and enable mergers and acquisitions with minimum regulations that can conveniently safeguard the legitimate interests of concerned stakeholders. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we have that kind of framework where approvals of the authorities are minimised, institutions work and everything is delivered by the market?‚Äù he asked.

It is disappointing when criticism comes from Curtly Ambrose: Stuart Law,"Stuart Law has asked the West Indian players to learn from their mistakes. (Source: Reuters) Stuart Law has asked the West Indian players to learn from their mistakes. (Source: Reuters)

After suffering an embarrassing defeat against England in the first Test, West Indies coach Stuart Law has claimed that his side will attempt to draw motivation from their win against Pakistan. It may be recalled here that West Indies had defeated Pakistan at Barbados in the beginning of the year. However, they have struggled since then.

According to a report in cricket.com.au, Law said, ‚ÄúWe sat down and we talked about our Test series against Pakistan. We got beaten in two-and-a-half days in Jamaica and came back and won the second Test. We played the same team, they played the same team and our boys stood up. Now we have had a look and seen what England are trying to do to us, we will have better knowledge going into it. We know what is coming, it is a matter of us finding a way to cope with it.

Law also spoke about the recent criticism by Curtly Ambrose and said that it was disappointing. ‚ÄúCurtly not long ago was a coach with this team so it is disappointing that criticism comes‚Äù, Law said.

Analyzing the performances, Law said, ‚ÄúWe have to understand why it is there. We are not performing as well as we want. It would have been nice if he had come into the dressing room to talk to the guys and express his displeasure to us. That would have been awesome but that didn‚Äôt happen. What can we do? We have to get our noses down, our backsides up and play better.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúWe did not play well. We have been very honest with our assessment. A lot of guys have been asked to look at themselves in the mirror by the captain. We have been very open and forthcoming with thoughts on how they can get better. We are giving them every ounce of support. These guys have got a lot of talent. They just need a bit of experience. Once they get that they will be pretty good.‚Äù

Commenting on the atmosphere in the dressing room, Law revealed, ‚ÄúIn dressing room we are very positive. I believe in these young men. They have got high skills. It is just the experience of learning how to play in a very tough environment. That is where we need to improve very quickly but that is going to take time. The criticism will come. I understand that. We can‚Äôt do much about it. We have to just blank it out, move forward and once we start putting things right on the field that criticism means nothing to us.‚Äù

Soul Strings: U Rajesh on the legacy of playing an Italian lute in the Carnatic classical system,"In the last three years, U Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound. In the last three years, U Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound.

Growing up in Palakal, Andhra Pradesh, U Rajesh never saw his older brother engage in sibling rivalry. ‚ÄúOr revelry,‚Äù says Rajesh, ‚ÄúHe was nine years older, would hardly talk or play and was always bent on a small fretboard, trying to figure something rest of us didn‚Äôt know. But I was a restive child, always wanting to go out to play, but he would never bother.‚Äù

In a telephone conversation from Chennai, Rajesh is referring to U Srinivas, better known to the world as Mandolin Srinivas, the famed musician who convinced the purists of the Carnatic classical world that an Italian lute, associated with court recitals in Europe, baroque concerti by Vivaldi and film music in India, could present the complexities of Carnatic music. Srinivas modified the instrument, using five single strings instead of the traditional four doubled strings and, in the process, the mandolin created gamakas, delivered nuances and gave pleasure to the rasikas as any other Indian classical instrument. Violin took decades to find that status in India. While the uninitiated enjoyed the novelty his music displayed, the connoisseurs loved the deft strokes, the technique, and the passion. So much so that when George Harrison stumbled upon Mandolin Ecstacy in the ‚Äô80s, a Srinivas album, he said in an interview, ‚ÄúEddie van Halen, eat your heart out‚Äù. Halen is one of the most distinguished guitarists in the history of rock music. Srinivas wasn‚Äôt in his twenties yet. His Carnatic career with the mandolin had just begun.

But Srinivas passed away in 2014 after a liver transplant failure. He was only 45, with a Padma Shri, a Sangeet Natak Akademi award and praises from Harrison and John Mclaughlin under his belt.

But, during the time he was alive, he taught Rajesh his unique style on the advice of Paramacharya of Kanchipuram. ‚ÄúI learnt some krithis. I always wanted to be a pilot. My brother said he‚Äôd help in that but, if I chose music, there would be no endorsements. ‚ÄòMy job will be to only teach you. No more,‚Äô he said. I was to take my pick,‚Äù recalls Rajesh, who did choose music, thinking he could go to his brother if there was a challenging situation. The two also played many duets. ‚ÄúAnd then, in a matter of just a month, he was gone. While performing, I still look to my right sometimes to get approval,‚Äù says 38-year-old Rajesh, who will be in Delhi on August 23 for a performance with sitar player Purbayan Chatterjee as a part of the 19th Amar Jyoti Concert presented by Pt Chaturlal Memorial Society. The organisation was formed in the memory of Pt Chaturlal, a fixture in Pt Ravi Shankar‚Äôs concerts abroad in the ‚Äô50s and one of the first Indian tabla players to introduce Indian percussion system to the West. Chaturlal died in 1965, at the age of 40. Ut Allah Rakha took over after that. The performance will be followed by a flute recital by Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia.

In the last three years, Rajesh says he has been trying to find his own sound. His collaboration with Chatterjee is also an endeavour in that direction. Apart from releasing Timeless, the last live recording of the kutcheri in Mylapore where he played with his brother, and performances at Chennai‚Äôs December season, he is actively collaborating ‚Äúto see how classical mandolin interacts with other Western instruments‚Äù. He‚Äôs already worked with Mclaughlin on Floating Point, which was nominated for a Grammy in 2009.

He will soon head to the US for his work with LA Philharmonic Orchestra. ‚ÄúThis exchange of notes widens my perspective of my own music. I‚Äôm trying to be my own musician, entangle myself with challenges, find answers myself,‚Äù says Rajesh.

Surround space: Parul Sharma‚Äôs debut solo presents her worldview through black and white photographs,"One of Parul Sharma‚Äôs photographs One of Parul Sharma‚Äôs photographs

Introducing the works that comprise her debut solo, photographer Parul Sharma notes that the collection is intended at re-examining the ‚Äúasymmetry of everydayness‚Äù. Clicked from her iPhone, the black-and-white photographs chronicle Sharma‚Äôs sojourns in the last couple of years ‚Äî Mumbai, London, Paris, Kyoto, Tokyo and Delhi ‚Äî but she prefers to keep the locations discreet. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to put anything in a box. I don‚Äôt want to hinder the perspective of a person who is trying to establish a connect with my framework based on their ideas and experiences. They should be able to interpret it the way they want, and that is art,‚Äù says the former communications professional.

The high ceilings at the imposing Bikaner House in Delhi seem befitting for the display. The 40 frames offer distant and more detailed observations, featuring spiral stairs, abstract compositions and architectural details. If in one frame an empty chair waits for its occupant, in another, the window grill forms patterns on inclined beds. Diagonal lines cut across a frame in a work, while in another, Sharma photographs a street from the hollow of a metal structure.

She shoots the arch of the well-recognised Ministry of Home Affairs building in Delhi, and offers an aerial view of a busy road in Tokyo. Concentric metal nails that fill a white backdrop appear like the cosmic dot or bindu that has inspired numerous Indian artists. It has also attracted the attention of the buyers, with three red dots pasted next to it a day after the exhibition opened.

There are other occasions when Sharma gives viewers a closer glimpse into her surroundings. She places an empty Hibiki whiskey bottle on a pile of magazines on a windowsill at her Delhi home, and plays with light at a Hauz Khas haunt. The black and white medium, she believes, helps her connect deeper with the viewers. ‚ÄúIt has a starkness, rawness, and life is largely black, white and grey,‚Äù says Sharma.

Akansh Sen Murder case: Defence seeks reports before framing of charges,"The matter is now slated to come up for hearing on September 1. (File) The matter is now slated to come up for hearing on September 1. (File)

Lawyers of Harmehtab Singh alias Farid, an accused in the high profile BMW hit-and-run murder case of Akansh Sen, has moved an application seeking CFSL reports before framing of charges against Harmehtab. The matter is now slated to come up for hearing on September 1. On Tuesday, the charges were expected to be framed in the court of Additional Sessions Judge JS Sidhu, but the defence counsel moved an application for getting the reports pertaining to the investigation.

In his application, advocate AS Sukhija demanded the report of BMW car (CH01 AP 1133) which was taken into possession by the Chandigarh Police from Gobindgarh. The samples of blood were then taken from the car and the same was sent for examination to CFSL. Sukhija also sought the viscera report of the deceased Akansh Sen and the report of blood stained clothes of deceased Akansh Sen, and Karanyog, Rajan, who took him to hospital after the incident. The report of the car (PB 05 W 004) in which the deceased was taken to hospital has also been sought.

Akansh Sen was allegedly hit by a BMW car early in the morning on February 9. He succumbed to injuries in PGIMER the next day. Sen was a relative of Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh.

"After World Championships failure, Neeraj Chopra in Zurich Diamond League","For Neeraj, this will be his third Diamond League Meeting appearance this season, having finished fifth and seventh in Paris and Monaco in June and July respectively. (Source: AP) For Neeraj, this will be his third Diamond League Meeting appearance this season, having finished fifth and seventh in Paris and Monaco in June and July respectively. (Source: AP)

His maiden World Championships in London ending in disappointment, India‚Äôs top javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra will now take part in the penultimate leg of the prestigious Diamond League Meetings in Zurich on Thursday.

19-year-old Chopra, the junior world record holder, failed to qualify for the final round at the London World Championships in London which concluded on August 14. He could not throw the iron spear to the automatic qualification mark of 83m and made an early exit from the competition.

He will be up against some of the best in world, including reigning Olympic champion Thomas Rohler of German and his compatriot and World Championships winner Johannes Vetter in this Swiss city on Thursday.

Except for Neeraj, all the other seven competitors in the top-class field had reached the final round in London.

For Neeraj, this will be his third Diamond League Meeting appearance this season, having finished fifth and seventh in Paris and Monaco in June and July respectively.

His season‚Äôs best remained the 85.63m effort which he did during the Federation Cup National Athletics Championships at Patiala in June.

He had a 85.23m while winning gold in the Asian Championships in July before coming up with a best throw of 82.26m in the (August 4-13) London World Championships.

The competition is expected to be a battle between Vetter and Rohler, though World Championships silver medallist Jakub Vadlejch of Czech Republic is also there.

Vetter had won gold in London with a throw of 89.89m while Vadlejch had come up with 89.73m to take the silver.

Another Czech javelin thrower Petr Frydrych, who had won a bronze in London with a throw of 88.32m, is not competing in Zurich on Thursday.

Vetter and Rohler, who finished fourth in London with a throw of 88.26m, have been dominating this season by consistently throwing above 90m.

This season, Vetter and Rohler have moved up to No. 2 and No. 3 respectively in all-time farthest throws of 94.44m and 93.90m respectively.

Frankfurt‚Äôs international schools see Brexit bonus,"Picture for representational purpose Picture for representational purpose

Frankfurt‚Äôs international schools see a bonus from Brexit after a deluge of calls from bankers who are set to be posted to Germany‚Äôs financial centre along with their children now that Britain has decided to leave the European Union. The city is the most popular place for banks to set up their new EU headquarters, prompting a surge of interest in its 12 international schools which teach in English and follow baccalaureate programmes. Paul Fochtman, head of the Frankfurt International School, said his usually quiet summer holiday was spent this year hosting planning calls three times a week to discuss Brexit.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no question a number of people are coming here,‚Äù Fochtman told Reuters on the 1,800-person campus on the edge of a hilly forest in one of Frankfurt‚Äôs affluent suburbs. Studies show as many as 10,000 jobs could move from London to Frankfurt over the next four years, according to Frankfurt Main Finance, a lobbying group that promotes the city as a financial hub, possibly bringing with them thousands of students.

Among banks that announced plans to relocate some of their EU operations to Frankfurt are Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley , and Standard Chartered. A number of Japanese banks have opted for Frankfurt including Daiwa , Sumitomo Mitsui Financial , Mizuho Financial , and Nomura Holdings. Although schools are keen on new business, they are cautious about the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, wary the influx of bankers could be lower than some lobby groups estimated or that some may commute while their children stay in London.

Even though Brexit only becomes official in March 2019, schools are proving to be an early indicator of future moves given the importance that parents put on a child‚Äôs education, which is often paid for by the employer.

NUMBER ONE BARRIER

‚ÄúSchool is often the No. 1 barrier to a move for families,‚Äù said Fochtman, whose school is losing 50 pupils after General Motors reduced its workforce in Frankfurt following a takeover of its Opel unit by France‚Äôs PSA Group. Frankfurt‚Äôs Strothoff International School said it was looking to buy land to build a new campus which would double its student body. Paris and Dublin in their pitches to attract bankers leaving London also committed to providing new schools for bankers‚Äô children.

In December, about six months after the Brexit vote, Eric Menges, chief executive officer of FrankfurtRheinMain, another group that markets the city, asked school officials to examine how Brexit would affect the education sector.‚ÄùWithin 30 minutes of the banking district, there are 30 bilingual schools, 12 of which offer the classic international school degree,‚Äù Menges said. Educators estimate about 10,000 international and bilingual students are currently enrolled.

Schools have said they will need financial guarantees to fund any significant expansion. One executive of a U.S. bank said it was in discussion with schools in Frankfurt to secure places and was asked to pay money in advance. Fochtman, whose school serves 60 nationalities, was initially sceptical that Brexit would impact his school until senior bankers began knocking on the door.

‚ÄúLEFT HOLDING THE BAG‚Äù

So far this year, Fochtman has hosted nine delegations from banks considering moving to Frankfurt. Delegations typically consisted of senior bankers and human resources executives. In the spring, Fochtman formed a taskforce to consider expansion but the school board decided to put on hold plans to build a new 1,800-person campus to focus on incremental growth until they have firmer signs the influx will be significant.

Uncertainty surrounding Brexit was behind the caution. ‚ÄúWe are left holding the bag‚Äù if the school builds for an additional 2,000 and fewer show up, Fochtman said. At Strothoff International School, south of Frankfurt, Bettina Otto, head of administration, said she was in contact with banks and was looking at ‚Äúseveral options‚Äù for a new campus to grow the student body from 300 to 800. She has already raised teaching staff numbers by five to 60, partly due to Brexit. In Dublin, a new private international school catering for local and expatriate students aged between three and eighteen years is scheduled to open in September 2018 and is hoping to benefit from relocating bankers.

As part of Paris‚Äô charm offensive to net employees from the big banks, France has pledged to build three more international schools targeted at expatriates‚Äô children in the greater Paris region by 2022. Tuition fees at Frankfurt International School for a 12th-grade student are about 22,100 euros. In comparison, a place for a 12th-grader in the British School of Brussels is around 34,000 euros.

‚ÄúIt is also worth noting that the most expensive international school here (Frankfurt International School) would be considered to be in the lower price bracket compared to other international schools across Europe,‚Äù said Menges of the FrankfurtRheinMain marketing team.

The US has asked India and Pakistan to continue to engage in direct talks aimed at reducing tensions between the two countries. ‚ÄúI think one of the things that we would do is ask or encourage India and Pakistan to sit down together and engage in direct dialogue that is aimed at reducing tensions between both of those countries,‚Äù State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert told reporters on Wednesday.

She was responding to a question on the statement made by the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson a day earlier in which he sought some steps of rapprochement on issues with Pakistan.

‚ÄúWhat was he referring to in terms of the steps India could take?‚Äù Nauert was asked at her daily news conference.

‚ÄúWell, I think going up to 30,000 feet, we view the whole strategy and handling Afghanistan as being a regional strategy, and that, of course, incorporates India as well as Pakistan, so incorporating all the nations in that region who we believe can help assist and help make Afghanistan a stable place where you‚Äôll never have a terror group that will take root in that country again and can launch attacks on other countries,‚Äù Nauert replied when asked if Tillerson was linking, a solution on Kashmir with Pakistan-Afghanistan.

‚ÄúIn terms of Kashmir, our policy on that has not changed. We continue to encourage the sides to sit down and talk together about that,‚Äù the spokesperson said.

"Jon Jones facing discipline, questions after failing drug test","Daniel Cormier (below) and Jon Jones are two fierce rivals. (Source: AP File) Daniel Cormier (below) and Jon Jones are two fierce rivals. (Source: AP File)

Jon Jones will need an awfully good explanation for the latest major setback in his checkered mixed martial arts career.

Jones could be facing a multiyear suspension after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency notified the UFC light heavyweight champion of a potential violation of the promotion‚Äôs anti-doping policy.

UFC President Dana White said Wednesday that the promotion likely won‚Äôt know for several weeks whether the test results will be confirmed after an examination of Jones‚Äô backup sample. Any potential discipline must wait until after the adjudication process afforded to every fighter.

But unless some extraordinary reason surfaces for Jones‚Äô latest failed test, the man widely considered the world‚Äôs best pound-for-pound fighter is facing another lengthy absence during his prime.

‚ÄúAt this point, who (cares) what I think? He‚Äôs done enough damage to himself,‚Äù White said while promoting Conor McGregor‚Äôs boxing showdown with Floyd Mayweather this weekend.

‚ÄúHis dad said it: Jon is his own worst enemy,‚Äù White added. ‚ÄúBoy, is that true. But sitting here today, it‚Äôs not over yet. He‚Äôs got to go through the process. Maybe there was something crazy that happened for this stuff to get into his system, so I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Jones has been provisionally suspended by USADA, which administers the UFC‚Äôs anti-drug policy. The California State Athletic Commission also has jurisdiction over Jones, who regained his light heavyweight title July 29 with a third-round stoppage of Daniel Cormier at UFC 214 in Anaheim. He failed a test conducted on a sample collected one day before the bout.

‚ÄúIf this holds up, and he ends up getting (a suspension of) two, three (years), it‚Äôs probably the end of his career,‚Äù White said.

Under its privacy rules, USADA won‚Äôt announce the substance for which Jones tested positive unless the fighter divulges it.

Jones‚Äô agent, Malki Kawa, appeared on ‚ÄúThe MMA Hour‚Äù podcast later Wednesday and said the fighter was told he had tested positive for turinabol, an anabolic steroid. Kawa said Jones passed two tests earlier in July, and the fighter is wondering whether he took a tainted nutritional supplement in the weeks before the bout.

Kawa posted a strident defense of his client on Facebook on Wednesday.

‚ÄúI know how hard he worked to get back to where he‚Äôs at,‚Äù Kawa wrote. ‚ÄúThis is definitely heartbreaking. He (definitely) didn‚Äôt cheat or use steroids. But I‚Äôm with him more now than the night he won the belt.‚Äù

Jones hasn‚Äôt publicly commented on the third failed test of his career.

He tested positive for cocaine in 2015, later publicly acknowledging he had used the drug. He then received a yearlong suspension in 2016 for what he claimed was a sexual enhancement pill. His fight against Cormier was his first since that suspension ended.

Penalties are compounded for multiple failed tests, and a multiyear suspension would leave the UFC without one of its rising pay-per-view draws. Jones‚Äô bad-boy image actually appears to have made him more marketable for the UFC, which has a current dearth of pay-per-view stars.

Brock Lesnar, Ronda Rousey, McGregor and Georges St. Pierre are all in various stages of retirement, comebacks or more lucrative side jobs, with only St. Pierre currently scheduled for an MMA fight.

Jones‚Äô mistake also throws two weight classes into upheaval.

White said Cormier is likely to regain the UFC light heavyweight title, which he held twice after Jones was stripped of the belt for his first two failed tests. Cormier also reigned atop the division while Jones was sidelined following his arrest over a hit-and-run accident.

Cormier has never lost to anyone but Jones, but the good-natured star will be in the same awkward position in which he found himself during Jones‚Äô previous forced absence.

And Jones appeared to be ready to make an impact on the UFC heavyweight division. White had been talking to Jones‚Äô camp about matching him with heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic in Detroit later this year in what would have been a blockbuster pay-per-view matchup.

Instead, Miocic must find a new opponent for his belt _ and any matchup that the UFC can make will be less intriguing than a showdown with Jones.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a lot of problems if this turns out to be true, but they aren‚Äôt problems compared to what Jon has,‚Äù White said. ‚ÄúThe list goes on and on of what could have been with Jon Jones.‚Äù

"Vishal Sikka gone, Infosys founders set stage for Nandan Nilekani to lead firm","Nandan Nilekani is considered neutral in Murthy-board battle, also most credible face in IT industry and with govt. (Source: Express File) Nandan Nilekani is considered neutral in Murthy-board battle, also most credible face in IT industry and with govt. (Source: Express File)

WITHIN days of Vishal Sikka‚Äôs resignation as MD and CEO of Infosys Ltd, the firm‚Äôs founders and former senior officials are learnt to have persuaded co-founder Nandan Nilekani to head India‚Äôs second-largest IT company. The founders and officials are also said to have planned a major rejig of the board that may include at least three new appointments from the founders‚Äô side, alongside Nilekani.

Speaking to The Indian Express on the condition of anonymity, a source close to the development said that Nilekani, along with some other founders, may soon step out on a road-show to restore investor confidence globally in the wake of the controversial churn at the top of the company.

Significantly, Nilekani had kept himself out of the boardroom battle between co-founder N R Narayana Murthy and the management and board of Infosys that played out over the last six months, often spilling into the public.

This, the source said, is behind Narayana Murthy‚Äôs reasoning that Nilekani, despite being a co-founder, is considered neutral. He is also seen as one the most credible faces in the Indian IT industry and, as the architect of Aadhaar, has widespread support within the current political establishment as well. The source said that Murthy feels that Nilekani‚Äôs entry will help restore investor confidence in the company.

Another source close to the development said that Nilekani was not in favour of entering the company ‚Äúuntil a few days ago.‚Äù However, things changed rapidly and Infosys founders have always come together for the company as ‚Äúthey go by what is right for the company,‚Äù the source said. An email sent to Nilekani asking if he had agreed to spearhead Infosys at the request of other co-founders and former officials of Infosys, went unanswered.

While Narayana Murthy went public with his criticism of the current management and the board raising issues of corporate governance, a source close to the founders said they were unhappy with Sikka because he did not deliver on ‚Äúcertain conditions‚Äù laid down at the time of his appointment. Among these, the source said, was that Sikka was asked to induct Narayana Murthy‚Äôs son Rohan Murty on the board of the company and also appoint certain founders and former officials as advisors.

‚ÄúSome founders and former senior officials at Infosys wanted Rohan Murty to be inducted into the company and this had been communicated to Sikka at the time of his appointment,‚Äù said the source. While an e-mail sent to Sikka seeking his comment on the issue did not elicit any response, a source close to Sikka said: ‚ÄúNo conditions were set by the founders at the time of his appointment as Infosys MD and CEO in 2014.‚Äù

When Narayana Murthy re-entered Infosys as its chairman in 2013, he brought in Rohan Murty as his executive assistant, a decision that attracted wide criticism since it went against the principle enunciated by the founders that that no family member of a founder can come to work at Infosys. Rohan Murty as EA to his father was seen by many as his backdoor entry into the company. An email sent to Narayana Murthy asking about his plans to induct Rohan Murty along with other questions on bringing in Nilekani did not receive any response.

Massachusetts lottery officials on Thursday identified a 53-year-old health care worker who lives in Chicopee as the winner of more than $750 million in a Powerball drawing, the largest prize for a single ticket-holder in the contest‚Äôs history.

The woman, Mavis Wanczyk, appeared at an afternoon news conference to claim her prize. ‚ÄúI wanted to get this over and done with, and then everyone would leave me alone,‚Äù Wanczyk, the mother of a 31-year-old daughter and a 26-year-old son, told reporters on Thursday. She said she had worked for the past 32 years at a Springfield hospital, but added: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve called them and told them I will not be coming back.‚Äù

Powerball said on its website that the single ticket matched all six numbers drawn on Wednesday night: 6, 7, 16, 23, 26 and the Powerball of 4. Wanczyk said she learned of her win when a colleague encouraged her to check her ticket as she left work on Wednesday. ‚ÄúI said: ‚ÄòI know it‚Äôs never going to be me; it‚Äôs just a pipe dream,'‚Äù Wanczyk said, adding that she was shocked to find ‚ÄúI am a winner.‚Äù

The winning ticket was sold at a Pride convenience store in Chicopee, which is located about 90 miles (145 km) west of Boston, according to the Massachusetts State Lottery. The owner of that store plans to donate to charity the $50,000 prize he will receive for selling the winning ticket, the commission‚Äôs executive director, Michael Sweeney, told reporters.

The state lottery had originally said the winning ticket was sold in Watertown, a suburb of Boston, but corrected its announcement hours later. ‚ÄúThis was the result of a human error,‚Äù Sweeney said. ‚ÄúOur internal systems, and I want to be clear about this, our internal systems always had the correct information.‚Äù

Wanczyk will have a choice of receiving annual payments totaling $758.7 million over 29 years, or a lump sum of more than $440 million, before taxes. Beyond retiring early, she did not say how she planned to spend her winnings.

The odds of a ticket having all six winning numbers are 292.2 million to 1, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Powerball tickets are sold in 44 U.S. states, and Washington, D.C.; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. No one had won the Powerball‚Äôs top prize in the twice-weekly drawings since June 10, when a California man won $447.8 million.

Scandal-hit Malaysian PM to visit White House,"Barack Obama was the first sitting US president to visit Malaysia since 1966 when he paid a trip to the country in 2014, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Kuala Lumpur earlier this month. Barack Obama was the first sitting US president to visit Malaysia since 1966 when he paid a trip to the country in 2014, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Kuala Lumpur earlier this month.

US President Donald Trump has invited Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to Washington, officials said today, despite a Justice Department investigation into a major corruption scandal that has ensnared the leader.

A White House statement said that Trump will welcome Najib to Washington on September 12 to strengthen ties ‚Äúwith one of America‚Äôs closest partners in Southeast Asia‚Äù.

The Malaysian foreign ministry confirmed the visit.

Najib has been battling allegations that billions were looted from a sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), in complex overseas deals that are being investigated by authorities in several countries.

Both the prime minister and the fund deny any wrongdoing.

Ties between the US and Malaysia have soured since the Justice Department filed civil lawsuits seeking to seize assets it said were purchased with stolen 1MDB money, encouraging Najib to move closer to China.

US authorities are trying to seize assets, from high-end real estate to artworks, it says are worth about $1.7 billion.

The lawsuits said a figure called ‚ÄúMalaysian Official 1‚Äù knowingly received huge sums of 1MDB money. A Malaysian Cabinet minister has confirmed that official was Najib.

Despite the scandal, the US views Malaysia as a key ally in Asia as it seeks to combat Beijing‚Äôs growing influence and will be keen to shore up relations.

Barack Obama was the first sitting US president to visit Malaysia since 1966 when he paid a trip to the country in 2014, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Kuala Lumpur earlier this month.

The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the trip, said Najib has been eager to emphasise his friendship with Trump, and is keen to use the visit to downplay the possibility of further probes.

Five books to look forward to in August 2017,"Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon) Indulge in some new books this August. (Source: Amazon)

Another month has gone by and a fresh set of books is ready to hit the nearest stands. With an intriguing mix of genres ‚Äî dominated by non-fiction ‚Äî August offers simple reading options without the hype that distracts and manipulates readers.

There are no big literary names, no grand book launches for the upcoming books in the coming month. Readers, thus, will have an opportunity to pick titles on the basis of merit and not on the credentials of their authors.

For those looking to focus on more trending issues, we have a couple of political biographies releasing ‚Äî and, yes, one is on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi. More literary readers may look forward to two anthologies of late writer Khushwant Singh. The list also has a revised biography of Agatha Christie, whose thrillers have once again created a buzz on social media after HarperCollins India released 25 limited facsimile editions of the best books from the Queen of Crime. There are several books focussing on economy and business from Hachette India.

But here are the five books that we can‚Äôt wait to read this August:

* The Generation of Rage in Kashmir by David Devadas (Oxford University Press)

This book by a former editor at Business Standard describes the livid experience of Kashmiris who came of age between 2007 and 2017. It shows that Kashmiris generally had high hopes for peace and stability when the militancy, which began in 1988, seemed to be tapering off around 2006 ‚Äî but alas, that was not to be. It explores the reasons why there was so much angst and rage, which exploded in agitations and stone-pelting in 2008, 2010, and 2016 and why a new militancy is on the rise. The book also traces the decline of hope among the Kashmiris as the situation worsened from a perceived threat to their identity in 2008 to rage over the killing of innocents in 2010. The anger, the author argues, has finally resulted in support for militancy in 2016.

* The Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told by Muhammad Umar Memon (Aleph)

Selected and translated by writer, editor and translator par excellence Muhammad Umar Memon, the 25 stories in this book represent the finest short fiction in Urdu literature. Every story in the anthology illustrates one or the other facet of the form in the Urdu literary tradition. But even more than for their formal technique and inventiveness, these stories have been included because of their power and impact on the reader. Despairing, violent, passionate, humorous, ironic and profound ‚Äî the fiction in ‚ÄúThe Greatest Urdu Stories Ever Told‚Äù will imprint itself indelibly on your mind.

* Politicshock by Meghnad Desai (Rupa)

In this perceptive account, Meghnad Desai, a Labour Peer in the House of Lords, opens up the debate beyond the West and looks at parallels between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump as two outsiders who broke through the barriers to reach the top. He analyses Asia‚Äôs challenge to Western hegemony and asks if the conventional wisdom about the hegemony of free trade liberalism needs re-examination. He peers into the future to look at the greatest challenge facing the world today: Will the Liberal Order survive, collapse or mutate? Is the world at a cusp? Is history ‚Äî the old saga of blood, sweat and tears ‚Äî about to resume its course?

* The Epic City: The World on the Streets of Calcutta by Kushanava Choudhury (Bloomsbury)

(Source: Amazon) (Source: Amazon)

A masterful and entirely fresh portrait of great hopes and dashed dreams from a major new literary voice. ‚ÄúEverything that could possibly be wrong with a city was wrong with Calcutta‚Äù ‚Äî and yet, after completing his education in the US, Choudhury embodied his parents‚Äô greatest fears by returning to the city they escaped for a better life. Sifting through the chaos and decay for the stories that are ignored by the papers, that don‚Äôt fall into any reporter‚Äôs beat, ‚ÄúThe Epic City‚Äù is a soulful, insightful and meticulously researched account of everyday lives and an extraordinary portrait of a city which is a world unto itself.

* India: Priorities for the Future by Bimal Jalan (Penguin)

(Source: Amazon) (Source: Amazon)

Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Bimal Jalan‚Äôs formidable analysis of the last four decades of India‚Äôs economic journey illuminates the nation‚Äôs transition from a strictly regulated, slow-growth state enterprise to one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Drawing on this vast experience, he compares two distinct periods ‚Äî 1980-2000 and 2000-15 ‚Äî to examine the core changes and their significance, and considers their lessons for the immediate future.

"AIFF wants to groom team for U-20 WC, 2024 Olympics","AIFF is set to groom the best talent from the U-17 and U-19 age-groups. AIFF is set to groom the best talent from the U-17 and U-19 age-groups.

Aiming high and far, the AIFF is set to groom the best talent from the U-17 and U-19 age-groups and form the nucleus of a squad, which it hopes, is good enough to represent India in the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2019 and the 2024 Olympic Games.

The All India Football Federation‚Äôs technical committee met in Bengaluru to discuss the development plan for Indian football beyond the FIFA U-17 World Cup, which will be held in the country from October 6 to 28.

‚ÄúThe idea is to have the best players from the U-17 World Cup team and the U-19 play the AFC U-19 Championship qualifiers and then the main event in 2018, eventually preparing them for the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2019 and the 2024 Olympics,‚Äù AIFF general secretary Kushal Das told PTI on Wednesday.

He added, ‚ÄúIf they do well and qualify for the main event in 2018 and finish in the top four, they will be able to play the 2019 FIFA U20 World Cup.

The technical committee meeting was chaired by Shyam Thapa.

He said: ‚ÄúThis is the right time for the AIFF to take up this long-term vision. I am very satisfied with the proposed long-term plan which would ensure the team gets prepared in the best possible fashion for future editions of Olympics, Asian Cup and Wold Cup.‚Äù

Thapa proposed the setting up of residential academies in each state in collaboration with the AIFF and state associations.

A detailed report on the proposals will be submitted to AIFF president Praful Patel.

All the proposals will come up for discussion in the next executive committee meeting of the apex body.

Asked if there are plans to ensure participation of a development side, like Indian Arrows in the past, in the I-league, Das said, ‚ÄúSaying that the U-17 World Cup side will play in the I-League will be a misnomer.

‚ÄúAgain, the idea is to form a squad by having the best players from the U-16, U-17 and U-19 sides and play in the I-League. That team will be managed by the AIFF.‚Äù

The technical committee felt that the team, composed of the young talents, should be given the best possible training and competitive environment, including ‚Äúparticipation in the I-League for season 2017-18‚Äù.

The technical committee also proposed to develop and groom Indian coaches and requested the technical director to come up with a detailed plan.

Vice-chairman of the technical committee, Henry Menezes, said, ‚ÄúThe U-17 World Cup squad is the best among the next generation and clubbing them with the U-19 national team is the perfect roadmap and the best thing which can happen to Indian football.

‚ÄúThe boys would get adequate time to know each other and be fully prepared for future international competitions.‚Äù

Saint-Etienne‚Äôs proud defensive record faces a Neymar test,"Neymar has been involved in eight of PSG‚Äôs nine goals in the two games. (Source: Reuters) Neymar has been involved in eight of PSG‚Äôs nine goals in the two games. (Source: Reuters)

Saint-Etienne is the only team in the French league not to concede a goal so far ahead of Sunday‚Äôs trip to play Paris Saint-Germain. Whether that remains the case after defending against Neymar remains to be seen.

Neymar has made a strong start to his PSG career since joining from Barcelona. It was somewhat expected considering he cost a world record 222 million ($262 million), but the speedy way he has adapted and the seamless high quality of his play have perhaps even exceeded expectation.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a way of stopping him,‚Äù said Toulouse striker Andy Delort, who witnessed Neymar‚Äôs destructive brilliance first-hand when PSG routed Toulouse 6-2 last weekend.

Somewhat modestly, Neymar puts his instant success down to the players around him helping him to settle in smoothly.

‚ÄúThe team has a Brazilian style of play and that makes it easier for me,‚Äù Neymar said. ‚ÄúThe presence of Daniel Alves, of Marquinhos, of the South Americans is very important. We can laugh and joke together.‚Äù

Opponents are not finding it funny playing against him.

Neymar has been involved in eight of PSG‚Äôs nine goals in the two games he‚Äôs played, scoring three of them. He touched the ball 118 times against Toulouse, scored twice and was directly involved in the four other goals.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs phenomenal, an artist. He‚Äôs just like Ronaldinho was, you just never knew what to expect when he got the ball,‚Äù Delort said. ‚ÄúThe only good thing is that we only have to play against him once more this season.‚Äù

The comparison with Brazilian ace Ronaldinho _ who made the reverse journey, leaving PSG to join Barcelona in 2003 _ is an apt one.

Like Ronaldinho, Neymar has an unpredictable edge to his game. Although not as explosive and direct as Ronaldinho _ a former Golden Ball winner _ Neymar‚Äôs electric pace and speed of thought make him a nightmare to defend against.

Neymar‚Äôs second goal against Toulouse was among the best solo goals the French league has seen in recent years. A blur of quick feet, astonishing balance and exotic dribbling moves, it left his spectators and teammates alike in awe.

‚ÄúHe scores goals you see in cartoons,‚Äù midfielder Marco Verratti said, while Edinson Cavani _ scorer of a whopping 49 goals for PSG last season _ added that ‚Äúfor us it seems crazy, but for him it‚Äôs just normal.‚Äù

Neymar‚Äôs starting position is on the left flank, but he rarely stays there. His eye for goal often takes him into more central positions, where he can use his skill and glue-like ball control to attack the heart of the defense at speed.

As the team‚Äôs center forward, Cavani also needs that central space to flourish. Therefore, signing Neymar came with an element of risk in that they might get in each other‚Äôs way _ or that Neymar would eat up the space needed by Cavani.

Yet in two games so far, they have switched positions with relative ease, and even set up goals for each other.

There seems to be none of the confusion that sometimes appeared in recent years, when Cavani had an awkward time alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic _ PSG‚Äôs all-time top scorer with 156 goals in just 180 games.

In fact, the early signs are encouraging that Neymar and Cavani _ who is still in his prime at 30 _ are highly compatible.

Potentially, PSG has a dream partnership in the making, and that‚Äôs unwelcome news for Saint-Etienne.

"Panama govt says to demand visas from Venezuelans, slams Nicolas Maduro","Venezuela‚Äôs President Nicolas Maduro (REUTERS/File Photo) Venezuela‚Äôs President Nicolas Maduro (REUTERS/File Photo)

Panama‚Äôs government said on Tuesday that from October Venezuelans wishing to enter the country would need a visa, accusing the administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of undermining democracy at home and security abroad. Speaking a few days after a visit to Panama by US Vice President Mike Pence, the country‚Äôs president Juan Carlos Varela said the visa requirement would take effect on Oct. 1 and remain in place until ‚Äúdemocratic order‚Äù was restored in Venezuela.

‚ÄúGiven the break in the democratic order in Venezuela, a situation that puts at risk our security, our economy ‚Ä¶ and after a careful analysis, I‚Äôve taken the decision to demand visas from Venezuelan citizens wanting to travel to Panama,‚Äù Varela said in a brief televised message to the nation. Varela said the situation in Venezuela had deteriorated since the government decided to press ahead with a 545-member constituent assembly in the face of strong criticism from around the Americas, including the United States and Mexico.

On Friday, the assembly granted itself lawmaking powers, dealing a new blow to the opposition-controlled congress, whose decisions have been nullified by the pro-government Supreme Court. Large numbers of Venezuelans have left their country due to economic and political turmoil. According to Varela, some 60,000 Venezuelans have moved to Panama in the last six years.
